I (25F) was raised in an extremely religious household. Growing up, I never felt overly feminine. Not as if I wasn\u2019t a girl, but I was never into dresses or makeup or anything like that. If I wanted to wear slacks to church, I would get screamed at. I wore dresses growing up (not just to church, but school) and always felt super uncomfortable. Around 15, I came out as a lesbian and my parents did not approve. I\u2019m not saying all lesbians dress like this, but I did tend to start wearing jeans, t-shirts, etc to school, slacks and nice shirts to events. I finally felt comfortable. My mom and I got into many arguments over this and my dad constantly told me that I was making a big deal over nothing.\n\nI was kicked out at 16 when I refused conversion therapy. My older sister, Mindy,  took me in and was the only one in my family who ever truly supported me. I lived with her all through college. I live with my girlfriend now, but Mindy and I maintained a very close relationship.\n\nMindy is engaged and getting married next summer. She asked me to be the maid of honor. We went shopping for her dress last weekend and she looks stunning! We went with two of her other bridesmaids. We just had an appointment for Mindy\u2019s dress but while the saleswoman was ringing everything up, the  bridesmaids and Mindy started looking at dresses for the bridal party. Nothing definite, but they got ideas on what to look for. Later, in private, I spoke to Mindy and reminded her I\u2019m not comfortable in a dress. I offered an alternative of wearing a tux or suit. We could even find one the same color of the bridesmaids.\n\nMindy said it was one day, couldn\u2019t I just wear a dress? She claimed a tux would make me look like a groomsmen (I have a pixie cut and due to my lack of makeup, I often get mistaken for a guy, especially when out with my very feminine girlfriend). I said I really wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. Plus a lot of our family is going to come which already makes me anxious. It\u2019s already going to be hard, in the same church that told me I was going to hell, surrounded by my family who said similar. Wearing a dress will make me feel like that teenager who had no control of their life and ended up in extensive therapy for having to conform to be loved.\n\n**EDIT: Putting this here as I think people usually skip over them at the bottom and I\u2019m getting the same \u201cwear a jumpsuit\u201d over and over again in spite of my edit. I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors. I also tried to make compromises on wearing the dress for pictures and the ceremony and then changing but she said that\u2019s too dramatic and it\u2019ll draw attention. It\u2019s wear the dress or bust. To add, I\u2019d also have to pay for a dress I\u2019d never wear again versus, I would wear a jumpsuit or suit or tux again.**\n\nIt escalated into a fight, where Mindy said I had to wear a dress, called me selfish and ungrateful. She told me she gave up her early 20s to help take care of me and now I can\u2019t do this. She was shaking and screaming. I told her this was too much and I just won\u2019t come at all.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 has called me several times, saying Mindy wants to apologize, it\u2019s not a big deal, if I just wear the dress it\u2019ll go away.  Mindy just wants her day to be perfect. AITA for refusing to give in?\n\nEdit: I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors.

You are valid in the way you feel and what not only your family, but the community you grew up in put you through. Your sister did do a lot for you in terms of giving you a support system and taking you in. That is part of the reason you are so close now. She didn't have to do that, but she chose to. I mean you are who she wants as her MOH probably because y'all are so close. She of all people should see how this is making you feel as well as knowing you well enough to know how this would affect you. But at the same time if Mindy is having her ceremony at the same church and will have a lot of family there I can see why she would want you in a dress. I imagine those people have not changed at all since you last saw them and is either getting outside pressure about non-attendance if xyz isn't \"traditional\" She also may be worrying about them calling you out verbally or potentially physically (idk your family or their history) for \"ruining\" your sisters holy matrimony celebration, for being \"dressed like a man\" or whatever other hateful nonsense they spew. So I can 100% see how she would want you there as you are probably the closest person she has, but not wanting to cause any drama with anyone that is to attend. Some wedding venues and churches also have a specific rules and dress codes that must be adhered to or they will not allow the wedding to be held there. (A friend of mine got married in a local church and the priest had to personally approve all attire to be sure that it would not be \"offensive to God\") Also wedding planning is stressful as hell without the prospect of potential drama so throw that in the mix and she's probably a walking ball of nerves right now. I think you both should sit down and revisit this conversation when you are both calm enough to hear the other out on what, how, and WHY this is such an ordeal. Then from there y'all can figure out a solution together.", "Gay man here, gently YTA. I get that your parents sucked and were controlling over what you could wear as a kid. I understand the freedom of not having to conform to those outdated gender stereotypes. However, its one day to do something nice for your sister, the woman who took you in after the rest of your family kicked you out. Yes you don't like dresses in your normal life, but this day isn't about you. Is not wearing a dress for one day really worth damaging your relationship with your sister?", "NTA.

I'm not a fan either, but there are some moments in life when you do things you don't like for bigger goals or for your love ones. We can't live running away of everything we dislike.\n\nAsk yourself if you're willing to risk damaging a relationship with your beloved sister for a dress in her wedding.\n\nAnd before someone says why 'the Bride is evil, she's forcing a dress' ... Well... As far as I'm concerned the bride always have a say in what the maid of honor is gonna wear in her wedding.", "YTA. I really don\u2019t understand the Reddit mob outrage that no one should ever do anything ever that made them uncomfortable.

Have the upper portion removed to make a separate top you can wear and pair with wide legged slacks made from the lower half and/or coordinated supplemental fabric.

However, by having me wear a dress so no one makes a scene or a comment (which ultimately, knowing my family, someone would)...is bending to them.\n\nTo me, my compromise was going period. I never told her this, but once she informed me she had invited our parents and was getting married in the same church that tried to get me to attend conversion therapy, I did debate not going. I am no contact with my parents, we haven't seen or spoken to each other in about 3 years. I obviously have a lot of trauma related to religion in general, specifically that church. In the end, I changed my mind because she has done so much for me and showed support. And it's her day in that sense, she can invite whoever she wants, get married wherever she wants, I would never ask her to change that. She has chosen to maintain a relationship with these people and stay in the church, which I would never judge or ask her to stop.\n\nAt this point, I feel I've done all the compromising I should have to. I'm putting up with people who do not like me, who think I'm going to hell. Who, regardless of what I wear, will likely whisper about me and my girlfriend.

She doesn't want you to disappear.\n\nI suggest you try to change how you think about wearing a dress at this wedding.  It's not an act of surrender.  It's an act of **defiance** to your shitty family.  They didn't accept you.  They want you gone.  They want to slander you to the guests.  If you do show up nothing would make them happier than for you to show how \"different and difficult\" you are.  They wanted to change you, abuse you and deny who you are.\n\nBut you sister said no.  Her actions must have caused drama between her and them.  Perhaps she never said anything about it.  They wanted you to disappear and she said no then and is saying no now.  \n\nYou wouldn't be wearing the dress for your shitty homophobic family, or their shitty homophobic guests.  When that shitty aunt comes up and says \"You look so nice, why was this so hard?\" you answer with: \"I'm doing this for my sister, who loves me as I am.  I'm not doing this for a bunch of hateful bigots.\"  You'd be wearing the dress because Mindy loves you, not because your family hates you.  \n\nI point out a few other ideas: as the MOH, you get to give a toast.

If you want to be maid of honor, and I know you love her, and she does love you, took you in etc, it is a part of one day the biggest day so far in her life and she wants you to ..just do it. \n\n\nWe do all kinds of things we're not comfortable with throughout life, this doesn't sound like it will traumatize you as you are grown, out for awhile now, happy with you not like if you were in the middle of discovery. Mature in other words.\n\n\nI'd negotiate the dress ONLY for the ceremony, then you can change and SHE has to eat the cost of it. You will have performed your duties as MOH, and get to enjoy knowing you'll be out of the wretched thing soon and have made your beloved sister happy, and she'll have the memories of her day as it is in her minds eye. None of this is a lesbian thing.", "NTA but neither is she. What if she paid for the dress and you just wore it for the ceremony and pictures?", "NTA. I think that Mindy is being a bit unfair. You even offered to wear a dress for ceremony and pictures and that still wasn't enough. I feel like she's allowing your religious family's pressure/homophobic ideals get the better of her. She obviously loves you but it seems like she doesn't want there to be drama about your outfit, especially after what your parents did. At the end of the day, you should be able to feel comfortable in what you wear and have come a long way to feel yourself. You're not wrong for wanting to feel comfortable while standing by your sister's side as she gets married, but at the same time if she keeps pressuring you about wearing a dress, maybe the better thing to do would be to step down as MoH to avoid any more drama. I honestly hope she comes around though.", "NTA but is this the hill to die on? I honestly wouldn't be surprised if you didn't have a sister after all this. Wear the fuckin' dress. You can make her wear a tuxedo when you get married.", "I bet heir parents are pressuring Mindy with financial bribery.  Something like: OP wears a dress or we don't pay for the wedding.\n\n100% NTA.", "Brides do hateful and cruel  things because culture has groomed them a wedding must be \"perfect\". She's hyperfocused on perfect and being a cruel, spiteful, childish, brat to get her perfect.\n\nI swear folk lose 3/4 their mind trying to plan a fancy wedding.", "This! Your appearance will take away from her perfect day?? Yikes.", "This is the big deal to me, like if someone wants you to be a part of their wedding party, but doesn't want you to go as yourself, they don't actually want you to be a part of their wedding party.\n\nIf it's just one day and it's not a big deal, then the perfection would be having your friends and family happy at your wedding, instead of looking for people to play a part", "This isn't just being \"uncomfortable\" though. Sure, I'd wear a dress that didn't fit me exactly right or wasn't my favorite color for my sibling's wedding. But there are certainly things I would feel extremely anxious about and unwilling to wear. \n\nYou and I may not have the gender identity issues that OP has, but we may have other things that would greatly affect where we would draw the line for bridesmaid outfits. Would I wear a bunny costume? Would I wear a bikini? Would I wear a cultural costume not of my own culture (or the bride/groom's)? Would I wear the Pope's outfit? There would be some outfit that would make you as \"uncomfortable\" as OP would be in a MOH dress. Imagine that scenario, as it is closer to the truth of the matter. \n\nI hope OP can attend as a guest and not the MOH if the bride can't allow a jumpsuit.", "I\u2019m kind of wondering if sister is worried that if OP wears something different from the other bridesmaids all the judgey people will devote their attention to OP, and she\u2019ll be the talk of the wedding instead of the bride. A lot of brides are hell bent on the idea that they should be the focal point of all attention on their day. Maybe in her mind, having op essentially camouflaged will stop a flare up of the drama that ensued back in the day.", "This right here, like the amount of coercion manipulation and harassment involved in this says that you shouldn't go to her wedding anymore. She has expressed that she resents you because she chose to take care of you, doesn't actually want you at her wedding, and is intent on wronging you.\n\nThat's a reason not to go to the wedding, since you're seeing not only who your sister is, but who her fiance is as well. If you're not loving the two people, it's better not to go to their wedding", "Oh yeah, cuz the fiance is just a flying monkey here. He's just telling the poster to go along with what his bride wants and nobody will get hurt.", "\u2026 this comment sure is heated\u2026is this the fianc\u00e9e or a family member?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Anyways. Just because she took her in doesn\u2019t mean she has to obide by everything the sister wants.", "This right here. It's impossible to apologize for a single thought or action when they are doing so much.", "Can confirm I\u2019m losing 3/4 of my mind planning my wedding. I\u2019m going to lose all of it as we get closer to the actual date.", "This is absolutely true and I experienced it first hand. It turns them completely wackadoodle.", "If she paid for it, would you wear it? (I still think she\u2019s being unreasonable to demand that you wear a dress - she is acting exactly like your mother did, and you should probably point that out to her, highlighting exactly why this is traumatising for you. \nBut if she wants you to wear something and won\u2019t compromise, ask her to finance it (if that works for you). \nWhy should you have to pay to feel bad about yourself?", "Yes you are right . Just because the sister took her in doesn\u2019t mean OP will have to dedicate her life to her sister. But the only thing being asked if OP is she wear a dress during her sister\u2019s wedding. Not matter how uncomfortable OP is that to me does not sound like a unreasonable request.\n\nIt is not like the sister is deadnaming the OP or asking her to wear a dress while she identifies as a guy. Those examples I understand, this I do not", "I'm in agreement here. I'm thinking either Mindy has had her heart set on this special day, and is reacting wrongly to a potential shift in her vision, or is getting substantial pushback or pressure from the religious family members. While she's acting negatively and aggressively, OP didn't state any homophobic comments or slurs.\n\nI'm sure Mindy will regret how things transpired, if not now, then in the future. NTA.", "I have to disagree respectfully. As a sister to 3 others, my siblings comfort come first and foremost no matter the occasion. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t force them to wear something they don\u2019t want to and aren\u2019t comfy wearing. Their opinions matter to me and maybe I\u2019m biased with my own situation but op\u2019s sister is someone I can\u2019t understand. Also the sister throwing the fact that she took her in all those years ago was icky to me. Could never be me.", "Your scenario is not the same. OP offered to wear a tux or a suit, not jeans and a polo. OP\u2019s sister is asking OP to present herself as someone she\u2019s not. A similar scenario would be your brother asking you to wear a dress and heels instead of a suit.", "NTA. You should tell her this whole thing. Hopefully it'll put things in perspective for her. If not, at least you tried", "Then OP should not go to the wedding.\n\nI didn't want to stand in a hot ass suit on a 100 degree day for my brother's wedding but I did because it was important for him and he asked me to.\n\nReally not a big ask and OP is making a huge deal out of nothing.", "Hey man if my brother asked me to wear a dress and heels to his wedding I'd rock it. \n\nWould probably have been cooler than the suit I had to wear in 100 degree heat.", "I think it's more just the sister not fully understanding Op's feelings. Op would be spending the day surrounded by her entire family who disowned her, in a church that probably told her she was gonna burn in hell, and be wearing a dress she hates. All of that considered, it's a miracle Op wanted to go at all. Sister isn't willing to let Op have this one thing to make her just a little comfortable, so yes I agree, Op should probably not go.", "would you also be okay to wear a dress and heels if you spent your entire childhood being forced to do so? expecting your sister to relive her trauma for your wedding is hella entitled"]}
