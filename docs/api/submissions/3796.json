I (25F) was raised in an extremely religious household. Growing up, I never felt overly feminine. Not as if I wasn\u2019t a girl, but I was never into dresses or makeup or anything like that. If I wanted to wear slacks to church, I would get screamed at. I wore dresses growing up (not just to church, but school) and always felt super uncomfortable. Around 15, I came out as a lesbian and my parents did not approve. I\u2019m not saying all lesbians dress like this, but I did tend to start wearing jeans, t-shirts, etc to school, slacks and nice shirts to events. I finally felt comfortable. My mom and I got into many arguments over this and my dad constantly told me that I was making a big deal over nothing.\n\nI was kicked out at 16 when I refused conversion therapy. My older sister, Mindy,  took me in and was the only one in my family who ever truly supported me. I lived with her all through college. I live with my girlfriend now, but Mindy and I maintained a very close relationship.\n\nMindy is engaged and getting married next summer. She asked me to be the maid of honor. We went shopping for her dress last weekend and she looks stunning! We went with two of her other bridesmaids. We just had an appointment for Mindy\u2019s dress but while the saleswoman was ringing everything up, the  bridesmaids and Mindy started looking at dresses for the bridal party. Nothing definite, but they got ideas on what to look for. Later, in private, I spoke to Mindy and reminded her I\u2019m not comfortable in a dress. I offered an alternative of wearing a tux or suit. We could even find one the same color of the bridesmaids.\n\nMindy said it was one day, couldn\u2019t I just wear a dress? She claimed a tux would make me look like a groomsmen (I have a pixie cut and due to my lack of makeup, I often get mistaken for a guy, especially when out with my very feminine girlfriend). I said I really wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. Plus a lot of our family is going to come which already makes me anxious. It\u2019s already going to be hard, in the same church that told me I was going to hell, surrounded by my family who said similar. Wearing a dress will make me feel like that teenager who had no control of their life and ended up in extensive therapy for having to conform to be loved.\n\n**EDIT: Putting this here as I think people usually skip over them at the bottom and I\u2019m getting the same \u201cwear a jumpsuit\u201d over and over again in spite of my edit. I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors. I also tried to make compromises on wearing the dress for pictures and the ceremony and then changing but she said that\u2019s too dramatic and it\u2019ll draw attention. It\u2019s wear the dress or bust. To add, I\u2019d also have to pay for a dress I\u2019d never wear again versus, I would wear a jumpsuit or suit or tux again.**\n\nIt escalated into a fight, where Mindy said I had to wear a dress, called me selfish and ungrateful. She told me she gave up her early 20s to help take care of me and now I can\u2019t do this. She was shaking and screaming. I told her this was too much and I just won\u2019t come at all.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 has called me several times, saying Mindy wants to apologize, it\u2019s not a big deal, if I just wear the dress it\u2019ll go away.  Mindy just wants her day to be perfect. AITA for refusing to give in?\n\nEdit: I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors.

You are valid in the way you feel and what not only your family, but the community you grew up in put you through. Your sister did do a lot for you in terms of giving you a support system and taking you in. That is part of the reason you are so close now. She didn't have to do that, but she chose to. I mean you are who she wants as her MOH probably because y'all are so close. She of all people should see how this is making you feel as well as knowing you well enough to know how this would affect you. But at the same time if Mindy is having her ceremony at the same church and will have a lot of family there I can see why she would want you in a dress. I imagine those people have not changed at all since you last saw them and is either getting outside pressure about non-attendance if xyz isn't \"traditional\" She also may be worrying about them calling you out verbally or potentially physically (idk your family or their history) for \"ruining\" your sisters holy matrimony celebration, for being \"dressed like a man\" or whatever other hateful nonsense they spew. So I can 100% see how she would want you there as you are probably the closest person she has, but not wanting to cause any drama with anyone that is to attend. Some wedding venues and churches also have a specific rules and dress codes that must be adhered to or they will not allow the wedding to be held there. (A friend of mine got married in a local church and the priest had to personally approve all attire to be sure that it would not be \"offensive to God\") Also wedding planning is stressful as hell without the prospect of potential drama so throw that in the mix and she's probably a walking ball of nerves right now. I think you both should sit down and revisit this conversation when you are both calm enough to hear the other out on what, how, and WHY this is such an ordeal. Then from there y'all can figure out a solution together.", "Gay man here, gently YTA. I get that your parents sucked and were controlling over what you could wear as a kid. I understand the freedom of not having to conform to those outdated gender stereotypes. However, its one day to do something nice for your sister, the woman who took you in after the rest of your family kicked you out. Yes you don't like dresses in your normal life, but this day isn't about you. Is not wearing a dress for one day really worth damaging your relationship with your sister?", "NTA.

I'm not a fan either, but there are some moments in life when you do things you don't like for bigger goals or for your love ones. We can't live running away of everything we dislike.\n\nAsk yourself if you're willing to risk damaging a relationship with your beloved sister for a dress in her wedding.\n\nAnd before someone says why 'the Bride is evil, she's forcing a dress' ... Well... As far as I'm concerned the bride always have a say in what the maid of honor is gonna wear in her wedding.", "YTA. I really don\u2019t understand the Reddit mob outrage that no one should ever do anything ever that made them uncomfortable.

Have the upper portion removed to make a separate top you can wear and pair with wide legged slacks made from the lower half and/or coordinated supplemental fabric.

However, by having me wear a dress so no one makes a scene or a comment (which ultimately, knowing my family, someone would)...is bending to them.\n\nTo me, my compromise was going period. I never told her this, but once she informed me she had invited our parents and was getting married in the same church that tried to get me to attend conversion therapy, I did debate not going. I am no contact with my parents, we haven't seen or spoken to each other in about 3 years. I obviously have a lot of trauma related to religion in general, specifically that church. In the end, I changed my mind because she has done so much for me and showed support. And it's her day in that sense, she can invite whoever she wants, get married wherever she wants, I would never ask her to change that. She has chosen to maintain a relationship with these people and stay in the church, which I would never judge or ask her to stop.\n\nAt this point, I feel I've done all the compromising I should have to. I'm putting up with people who do not like me, who think I'm going to hell. Who, regardless of what I wear, will likely whisper about me and my girlfriend.

She doesn't want you to disappear.\n\nI suggest you try to change how you think about wearing a dress at this wedding.  It's not an act of surrender.  It's an act of **defiance** to your shitty family.  They didn't accept you.  They want you gone.  They want to slander you to the guests.  If you do show up nothing would make them happier than for you to show how \"different and difficult\" you are.  They wanted to change you, abuse you and deny who you are.\n\nBut you sister said no.  Her actions must have caused drama between her and them.  Perhaps she never said anything about it.  They wanted you to disappear and she said no then and is saying no now.  \n\nYou wouldn't be wearing the dress for your shitty homophobic family, or their shitty homophobic guests.  When that shitty aunt comes up and says \"You look so nice, why was this so hard?\" you answer with: \"I'm doing this for my sister, who loves me as I am.  I'm not doing this for a bunch of hateful bigots.\"  You'd be wearing the dress because Mindy loves you, not because your family hates you.  \n\nI point out a few other ideas: as the MOH, you get to give a toast.

Mature in other words.\n\n\nI'd negotiate the dress ONLY for the ceremony, then you can change and SHE has to eat the cost of it.

At the end of the day, you should be able to feel comfortable in what you wear and have come a long way to feel yourself. You're not wrong for wanting to feel comfortable while standing by your sister's side as she gets married, but at the same time if she keeps pressuring you about wearing a dress, maybe the better thing to do would be to step down as MoH to avoid any more drama.

Sure, I'd wear a dress that didn't fit me exactly right or wasn't my favorite color for my sibling's wedding. But there are certainly things I would feel extremely anxious about and unwilling to wear. \n\nYou and I may not have the gender identity issues that OP has, but we may have other things that would greatly affect where we would draw the line for bridesmaid outfits. Would I wear a bunny costume? Would I wear a bikini? Would I wear a cultural costume not of my own culture (or the bride/groom's)? Would I wear the Pope's outfit? There would be some outfit that would make you as \"uncomfortable\" as OP would be in a MOH dress.

Of course you are! You're not an AH for saying no. But I don't think it's fair to expect to stay in the bridal party and for you to be given special treatment.

She gave up a lot, she risked her relationship with your family, she gave up her 20s to take care of you. And you don't want to do the same for her.", "The wording really feels like a threat", "Add the fact that she is expected to pay for the dress herself", "She should definitely not expose her GF to these people. Firstly, there is a very real element of danger being Queer in an environment like that. And who knows what breed of Christian nut job these people are, but many use religion to justify threatening or violent behaviour. Secondly, it would just be an unpleasant experience knowing that everyone in the room condemns you to hell. I wouldn't want to put anyone through that. Edit, grammar", "YES!  I second this notion!\n\nNot only was Mindy not willing to compromise by letting OP change for the reception, but her apology was A. via her fianc\u00e9 \\[insert eye roll here\\] and B. not an apology but essentially extortion.\n\nI'm feeling like Mindy is TA here. Do you feel OP owes you something for doing the right thing and taking her it when the Family through her to the wolves at 16?  Why wouldn't you want your loved one to be comfortable at your party?  And why isn't it cool for a woman to wear a tux?", "Sadly none of those colors are from the rainbow\n:(", "I didn't even think about the family being in her ear. They probably said something like they won't even come to the wedding if OP is going to dress anyway except \"properly\" because they don't want to \"support that\" or something like that", "But they possibly didn't have the same traumatic experiences growing up regarding dress and such", "no. gender identity issue is \"I don't fit as a woman\"\n\nbut op is clear that she's a woman.\n\nyou're looking for trans where there are none.", "Are you really characterizing OP being miserable all day at her sister\u2019s wedding, while being required to pretend otherwise, and forevermore knowing that her sister put aesthetics over OP\u2019s significant feelings on this, as \u201cOP can be happy\u201d?\n\nI agree that OP can choose to try to maintain her relationship with her sister, by giving in. But she won\u2019t ever feel the same about that relationship herself, so the benefit of giving in may not be much. And it\u2019s Mindy who\u2019s done that damage, irrespective of what OP does now.", "Yeah I agree. Especially when she has spent her whole life being pressured by her family to wear typically feminine clothing, I can definitely see how wearing a dress to a wedding that her family will be at can feel like letting them win. I have a big problem with people thinking they got one over on me, and this would be a horrible situation because even if they didn't think that, in the back of my mind I would definitely feel like they were being smug about me finally submitting to what they wanted", "I'm sure not. That's where the misunderstanding is coming from. OP views it as very negative and having to change herself. Her sister views it simply as clothing and probably thinks OP doesn't care about her. They're coming from completely different perspectives.", "But sister knows exactly what she went through, so should be more understanding", ">Hey man if my brother asked me to wear a dress and heels to his wedding I'd rock it.  \n>  \n>Would probably have been cooler than the suit I had to wear in 100 degree heat.\n\nWhile I find your comment amusing and get it was intended to diffuse the growing tension, I think you are missing the point.  What if your brother's bride required all the men to wear a thong to the wedding? Or tights?  Or a full body banana costume that you could not walk in nor sit down in?  How comfortable would you be then?\n\nOP is already the black sheep per say of her Family and the Bride asking her to wear a dress & heels means she does not actually see OP, she is not understanding what she is actually asking of, or more accurately, demanding of OP.  She is not \"reading the room\" so to speak.  \n\nThere is also the underlying sense of entitlement, that as a Bride you get to dictate what other people wear to your party, regardless of how they feel about it.  It's juvenile.", "We're you traumatised by your parents growing up because of your identity and who you were?", "NTA and tell her fianc\u00e9 it\u2019s already gone away by your no attending. No need to worry about what you will wear that day now.", "NTA. My friend got married in August and he had a bestwoman instead of a bestman and she wore a tux. The AH thing here is your sister making it such a huge deal for you to wear a dress when you literally have extremely valid trauma surrounding dresses especially in that church.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for you. They need to understand that it is a big deal, for you dresses are not clothes they're a representation of all the harm your family caused to you.\nI can't understand how somes brides just expect everyone put themselves and their needs out to giving them \"a perfect wedding\". That concept itself is ridiculous and selfish. The whole point of a wedding is share your happiness with the people you love when it became a justification for demanding money, gifts and sacrifices?\nI would be proud of having my little sister in front of all my family wearing what makes her feel herself and showing how important she's to me", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH here because I can understand Mindy\u2019s perspective. I don\u2019t really agree with it but I can\u2019t fault someone for wanting their wedding to be as perfect as can be, but on that same token I\u2019m siding with OP because the dress represents everything OP had to deal with as a kid, the traumas of the past. It\u2019s not just about being uncomfortable, it\u2019s also about not wanting to please her garbage family who tossed her out for not being \u201cnormal\u201d, for daring to be queer and not effeminate, so trying to get her into a dress is almost like trying to bring back the past. While I don\u2019t think Mindy is an asshole, I do think she\u2019s overreacting and not really understanding OP\u2019s perspective", "NTA. I got married this spring and I truly do not understand the insistence on people matching, especially if someone you (the bride) love is going to be uncomfortable as a result! You\u2019re not even a bridesmaid; you\u2019re the maid of honour, and it would be totally reasonable for you to have a different outfit. But even if you were a bridesmaid, your discomfort shouldn\u2019t be less important than a matching dress.\n\nThe only people who kind of matched at my wedding were my husband and his best man, who wore matching nerdy ties. It was adorable.", "NTA you offered compromises and to be honest it wouldn't be reflecting the true you if you wore a dress.", "YTA\n\nWhen you agreed to be MOH, it never occurred to you that you would have to wear a dress? \n\nYes, you will be uncomfortable. But it\u2019s one day. And this one day is not about you. After your sister took you in for so many years, you could do this one thing for her. \n\nHer wedding is not about you. If you wear a suit, you WILL be the center of attraction. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do this one thing for her, just drop out of the wedding party. She deserves someone who will be there for her.", "Since neither of you can agree on this, just bow out. Otherwise your sister spends her very special day (that IS all about her) wishing had worn a dress, or you spend your sister\u2019s special day (that ISN\u2019T at all about you) wishing you hadn\u2019t worn a dress.", "NTA. You'd think Mindy's \"perfect day\" would involve all her loved ones feeling happy and excited to celebrate her and her husband. Instead, she wants to use it to control you and make you uncomfortable. I'm sorry you have to deal with this :(", " NAH\nIt\u2019s her wedding she can decide what she wants it to look like. Don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to be to support Mindy in the way that she wants. It\u2019s that simple.", "Going against the grain here a little, ESH. She should calm her tits and not be so dramatic but I do see why she\u2019s so upset. And you\u2019re also TA as you should be willing to sacrifice being comfortable for a few hours for the person who sacrificed a lot for you. She has sacrificed relationships and her 20\u2019s for you, she stepped up when no one else would but you can\u2019t go a few hours in a dress for her? That\u2019s why she\u2019s upset, your comfort for a few hours is more important to you the what your sister wants given everything she\u2019s done for you. I would imagine that\u2019s a big hurt for her, you\u2019ve essentially shown her that her sacrifices don\u2019t mean anything to you and she\u2019s feeling like she\u2019s been willing to do more for you than you would for her. Sure, you don\u2019t *have* to go, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to but it will inevitably change the relationship you have with your sister. She will see it (right or wrong) that she has done so much for you but you won\u2019t reciprocate it. Aside from all this you accepted the role as MOH, bride chooses MOH outfit. It\u2019s EXTREMELY common for bridesmaids and MOH to be dressed in outfits they absolutely hate but they wear them for the bride. \n\nYou are free to do as you please and I understand it makes you uncomfortable but if you\u2019re comfort for a couple of hours is more important than your sisters wedding then don\u2019t expect your relationship with her to stay the same.", "Nah. \n\nMindy is  a good person that supported you and doesn\u2019t deserved to be vilified over an argument for wanting specific attire for her wedding.\n\nThe dress makes you uncomfortable.\nThe tux makes her uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you OP. Whether or not this dress is a dealbreaker or suggest not to go.\n\nAs an older sister, she\u2019d like her family there but also she has to navigate a couple generations. I don\u2019t fault her for not wanting to make her wedding about how the extended family feels about you or your self expression. I\u2019m glad you had someone to take you in as a teen. This wedding shouldn\u2019t take away from that.", "\u201cSacrifice\u201d for your sister, as she did for you. Or be the AH, as you are. \u201cWahhhhh I\u2019ll be uncomfortable for an evening\u201d.

I think it\u2019s ridiculous you can\u2019t wear a dress to make your sister happy.\nEspecially after how she has supported you over the years.", "NTA.  You have every right to want to be comfortable and as your sister, she should have been more willing to compromise.   I would have suggested that you try wearing pants or leggings under the dress but based on her reactions when you offered other suggestions and compromises, she doesn't deserve to even have you in her wedding.", "YTA.  Dude, it's one day for your sister. Look at it as a costume party.\nIronically you're letting the same people dictate what you wear still, just this time it's in the opposite way. You're not that teenager anymore.", "YTA for making a big deal about it now.\n1. Most people do not expect to wear bridesmaid dresses again.\n2. It is customary for bridesmaids/moh to wear similar/matching dresses\n3. If you read this reddit you know brides expect bridesmaids to cut their hair, dye their hair, have medical procedures, and all kinds of crazy stuff (not saying that is ok!!)\n3.Why didn't you talk  to your sister about this before you agreed to be MOH if wearing a dress for one day was a deal breaker?\n\nI hear what you are saying about your comfort zone, but it is not your wedding. Your sister is not wrong to ask. You need to decide if this the hill you die on with the one family member was always there for you and who loves you and accepts you.", "How about Palazzo pants (sp). Wide leg flowing pants that when your legs are together could be mistaken for a dress. It\u2019s a compromise. Remember your sister risked her family too, by supporting you for years. NAH  but it is one day and she loves and supports you try to do the same. You both will appreciate", "Nah.  I'm thinking mindy doesn't realize exactly how much stress and discomfort this causes you.  I'm sure she is just picturing a wedding she has been thinking about since she was a little girl.  Yall need to sit down with an unbiased 3rd party that can help yall see each other.", "I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s N A H or E S H. Mindy knew the trauma she was unearthing with the forced-dress-in-church reminder that their family will only love OP if she looks and acts the way they want. OP knew that her sister, though going a different direction with her life and choices, would also be affected by her family\u2019s control and bigotry and could have put on something that makes her feel awful for one day.\n\nI would wear something that makes me uncomfortable for my sister if she asked. My sister would never ask me to do something in public that made me uncomfortable. It seems like well-meaning, loving sisters are still suffering the religious abuse with which they were raised.\n\nOkay, decided. NAH. Sorry OP and sis.", "ESH. You both seem like nice people and it\u2019s a shame that you let it escalate so badly.", "NTA.  You offered so many compromises, including one where you would actually have to wear a dress for several hours. She didn\u2019t budge. And I am not sure what Mindy is apologising for if she still insists on the dress.\n\nThis may honestly be a situation where it is better to step down on being in the wedding party. Sad, but the only way, given Mindy\u2019s position, that you both will not be miserable.", "You should not attend the wedding, but not because of the dress.  Your parents will make it a hellish experience and ruin the day for your sister, too.", "YTA...it's one fucking day. If you can't go out of your way for your SISTER WHO TOOK YOU IN, then you are a 100% TOTAL AND COMPLETE AH!!!", "NTA if this is a hill both you and your sister will die on it sounds like you should graciously step down as MOH before things get worse", "YTA. It's Mindy's wedding and you agreed to be MOH, the bride picks out the dress for everyone.  I understand you don't like dresses but you certainly can wear one for one f'ing afternoon.", "NTA. You should be able to feel comfortable or confident in what you are wearing to your sisters wedding.\n\nI was looking at dresses online and saw some that look like dresses but have a jumpsuit underneath with a high slit up the front called the walk through or something like that. They looked awesome with fancy designs on them gorgeous outfits. Maybe if you find pics of something like that, your sister would work with you on it.", "YTA - While I agree that you gave many options that should be okay, Mindy wants consistency for the bridesmaids.  In my circles no one would think twice about a bridesmaid wearing a tux or jumpsuit but, given your religious background, you would be the talk of the family if you wore a tux.  Let her be the focus that day. She has has offered you so much support over the years, financially and emotionally. I think you should suck it up for a single day.", "NTA  That said.  If someone made room in their life for me, at a time I was in crisis no less, I'd wear whatever they want to their wedding.  Even a dress.", "NTA. Reading through your feelings, all I could think was \u201csame\u201d. Grew up in the church, mom always dressed us in pretty dresses and I would have meltdowns over how uncomfortable and unhappy I was. Being able to be your true self, cut your hair the way you want, dress the way you want, etc is everything. Your safety, wellness and happiness have to be your priority, and you have every right to not put yourself in a position that would compromise any of that.", "I was leaning towards N A H but your sister's reaction put it to NTA. Generally brides kind of pick the bridesmaids clothing but you did offer options to fit her theme and make you comfortable. Her screaming at you is out of line, especially knowing the religious trauma you grew up with. I don't understand why you wearing a dress for pictures and the ceremony then changing would be a problem. You could probably find a style that's two pieces and have the same top on and just swap a skirt for pants and not even look out of place. She's just being very controlling.", "NTA. She cares more about everything than you in this situation. Just because she has helped you in the past doesn't mean you are obligated to face your biggest trauma the worst way for her perfect wedding.", "It makes me super happy that this is the top comment. \nNTA. You\u2019ve spent your whole life figuring out what makes you comfortable, and happy. Do not give that up. Unconditional love is, by definition, unconditional.", "I also can't imagine still having the wedding in a church that tried to convert my loved one from being gay. That alone seems tone deaf to me.", "Agreed NAH. I can't fault OP for not being comfortable in a dress after years of being forced to wear them and ostracized by the adults responsible for her care, nor her sister who dropped her whole life to care for her feeling unappreciated because, in her (incorrect) heteronormative view (which is clearly their entire upbringing and family culture), wearing a dress on one important day is an easy thing to do.\n\nTalk it out. See how it goes. Be sure to show her how much you understand and appreciate all she did for you, as well as how much flack she has taken over the years for taking you in and letting you be you. She may feel that she will be ostracized further if you don't wear a dress as a bridesmaid. She definitely does not understand why dresses are so incredibly uncomfortable for you. Sit down to talk and establish to calmly go in with the goal of love and compromise. Maybe you attend the wedding and take on another role. Maybe you wear a matching jumpsuit. Maybe you come up with another solution.\n\nI hope it works out!", "This is the one.

This is universal lol", "Yeah, if she wears a dress this time she can be bullied again into wearing it another time...", "Mindy is in an impossible situation: exclude her sister, whom she loves and has supported for years against her family, or have drama at her wedding.  Perhaps enough drama that she is forced to cut off her family, a bridge she obviously isn\u2019t willing to cross yet.  \n\nLots of people here are far too quick to demand OP blow up the closest relationship she has, based on years of affection, over this one request.  My answer/suggestion is simply to keep the communication open between them, to perhaps not see the dress as a surrender but as a middle finger to the bigots.  \n\nDoes anyone really think Mindy, who took her in against her family, has been a secret homophobe all this time, or has suddenly turned into one?", "This right fucking here.\n\nI am in my thirties. I JUST started to be able to wear and enjoy dresses after deconstructing those three decades of religious trauma. My partner has been amazing at helping me; he is encouraging and never pushed me to wear things that make me uncomfortable.\n\nI still can't wear long-sleeved dresses because of it. \n\nOP is NTA. Sister is being irrational so she can have a Perfect Princess Day at the expense of her sibling. Anyone who is disagreeing has no idea what it is like to have your body go into full panic mode because of the way fabric reminds it of decades of hell, or else are insensitive enough to not acknowledge that it can undo years of work in a second... just so she can be Pretty Princess at the expense of her sister's mental health.", "The maid of honor usually stands out anyway.

Op is nah.", "Like Monica said to Chandler, I don't want a big fancy wedding, I want a marriage.\n\nThat's what it's all about.", "*gender presentation issue, becaue OP is a woman who isn't comfortable being feminine? It is an issue.\n\nAlso cis people can still be GNC (gender not conforming), which is somewhat OP's case of being butch.", "It depends on how much they talked about and how much the sister really listened to.
