I (25F) was raised in an extremely religious household. Growing up, I never felt overly feminine. Not as if I wasn\u2019t a girl, but I was never into dresses or makeup or anything like that. If I wanted to wear slacks to church, I would get screamed at. I wore dresses growing up (not just to church, but school) and always felt super uncomfortable. Around 15, I came out as a lesbian and my parents did not approve. I\u2019m not saying all lesbians dress like this, but I did tend to start wearing jeans, t-shirts, etc to school, slacks and nice shirts to events. I finally felt comfortable. My mom and I got into many arguments over this and my dad constantly told me that I was making a big deal over nothing.\n\nI was kicked out at 16 when I refused conversion therapy. My older sister, Mindy,  took me in and was the only one in my family who ever truly supported me. I lived with her all through college. I live with my girlfriend now, but Mindy and I maintained a very close relationship.\n\nMindy is engaged and getting married next summer. She asked me to be the maid of honor. We went shopping for her dress last weekend and she looks stunning! We went with two of her other bridesmaids. We just had an appointment for Mindy\u2019s dress but while the saleswoman was ringing everything up, the  bridesmaids and Mindy started looking at dresses for the bridal party. Nothing definite, but they got ideas on what to look for. Later, in private, I spoke to Mindy and reminded her I\u2019m not comfortable in a dress. I offered an alternative of wearing a tux or suit. We could even find one the same color of the bridesmaids.\n\nMindy said it was one day, couldn\u2019t I just wear a dress? She claimed a tux would make me look like a groomsmen (I have a pixie cut and due to my lack of makeup, I often get mistaken for a guy, especially when out with my very feminine girlfriend). I said I really wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. Plus a lot of our family is going to come which already makes me anxious. It\u2019s already going to be hard, in the same church that told me I was going to hell, surrounded by my family who said similar. Wearing a dress will make me feel like that teenager who had no control of their life and ended up in extensive therapy for having to conform to be loved.\n\n**EDIT: Putting this here as I think people usually skip over them at the bottom and I\u2019m getting the same \u201cwear a jumpsuit\u201d over and over again in spite of my edit. I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors. I also tried to make compromises on wearing the dress for pictures and the ceremony and then changing but she said that\u2019s too dramatic and it\u2019ll draw attention. It\u2019s wear the dress or bust. To add, I\u2019d also have to pay for a dress I\u2019d never wear again versus, I would wear a jumpsuit or suit or tux again.**\n\nIt escalated into a fight, where Mindy said I had to wear a dress, called me selfish and ungrateful. She told me she gave up her early 20s to help take care of me and now I can\u2019t do this. She was shaking and screaming. I told her this was too much and I just won\u2019t come at all.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 has called me several times, saying Mindy wants to apologize, it\u2019s not a big deal, if I just wear the dress it\u2019ll go away.  Mindy just wants her day to be perfect. AITA for refusing to give in?\n\nEdit: I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors.

That being said for someone who took you in, cared and loved you a think a Little compromise here would go along way.   It\u2019s one day for her.  And is this a hill you\u2019re really willing to die on and potentially forever ruin that relationship?   Before you really push this issue please think long and hard about it.   And have a sit down with your sister in a private space and talk it out without the emotion of you can.\n\nEDIT to add:  OP, I see you also mention having to buy a dress for one day.  Well, its likely all the other bridesmaid will never wear them again either.

I cannot judge you for your stance. I can\u2019t say you are an A for not doing the same as I would hypothetically do. You have different life experiences and baggage than I do.

Seems like there's not an easy answer here. The best I can suggest is going with your gut. If I were in your shoes, I would probably wear the dress and take a few days off afterwards to decompress and the like, but I can't tell you what the best answer would be for you in this sitch.

You are valid in the way you feel and what not only your family, but the community you grew up in put you through. Your sister did do a lot for you in terms of giving you a support system and taking you in. That is part of the reason you are so close now. She didn't have to do that, but she chose to. I mean you are who she wants as her MOH probably because y'all are so close. She of all people should see how this is making you feel as well as knowing you well enough to know how this would affect you. But at the same time if Mindy is having her ceremony at the same church and will have a lot of family there I can see why she would want you in a dress. I imagine those people have not changed at all since you last saw them and is either getting outside pressure about non-attendance if xyz isn't \"traditional\" She also may be worrying about them calling you out verbally or potentially physically (idk your family or their history) for \"ruining\" your sisters holy matrimony celebration, for being \"dressed like a man\" or whatever other hateful nonsense they spew. So I can 100% see how she would want you there as you are probably the closest person she has, but not wanting to cause any drama with anyone that is to attend. Some wedding venues and churches also have a specific rules and dress codes that must be adhered to or they will not allow the wedding to be held there. (A friend of mine got married in a local church and the priest had to personally approve all attire to be sure that it would not be \"offensive to God\") Also wedding planning is stressful as hell without the prospect of potential drama so throw that in the mix and she's probably a walking ball of nerves right now.

However, its one day to do something nice for your sister, the woman who took you in after the rest of your family kicked you out.

And it's her day in that sense, she can invite whoever she wants, get married wherever she wants, I would never ask her to change that. She has chosen to maintain a relationship with these people and stay in the church, which I would never judge or ask her to stop.\n\nAt this point, I feel I've done all the compromising I should have to. I'm putting up with people who do not like me, who think I'm going to hell. Who, regardless of what I wear, will likely whisper about me and my girlfriend. I'm standing in the church, with the priest who tried to get me to change who I was. She can't do a little compromising either?", "I showed several examples of fancy jumpsuits, suits and tuxes. She isn\u2019t interested.", "I get it, being in that church surrounded by all those hateful people isn\u2019t just awkward for you but truly offensive. I don\u2019t think Mindy is playing both sides, she just wants everyone that she loves to be there. This is why I think talking to her about just being a guest is a good compromise. That way you can fade into the background whenever you want but still be there to share the day with her.", "Can you talk to her about how you feel about having to be in her church with your parents? She probably doesn't realize that it's traumatic.", "Again actually talk to her. You are making assumptions . The fact they you are throwing in her face that just by attending you are doing her a favor, when she is your sister who you have openly said has done nothing but support you is concerning.  Let every body there whisper all the hell they want. Show them how happy you and your girlfriend are instead of acting like you going to a funeral", "https://www.azazie.com/search?q=Jumpsuit%20&dress_type=&cat_id=&fp=product7&sourceTag=\n\nWhat about any of these? I know they\u2019re more feminine than a tux, but since y\u2019all are so close, I feel it\u2019d be best if y\u2019all could find some middle ground.", "I\u2019m really trying to be nice here, but we have exhausted all options. I was willing to wear a jumpsuit, because as you said it\u2019s a happy medium. She wants me to match the bridesmaids and isn\u2019t budging. The question at hand isn\u2019t about finding the right one. It\u2019s if I\u2019m an asshole for refusing for wear the dress period.", "I don't find any of this appropriate for a wedding. :/", "No your not.\n\n\n\nThis is a hard line for you. And you also need to be comfortable.  As your sister and friend she should understand. \n\n\nI would never force someone to wear something that they were uncomfortable in. Nta", "Ha, okay. \n\nThen yes, YTA.", "Thank you for a straight forward answer. And I say that without malice, i  came here for genuine answers.", "I mean, it\u2019s her day. If you don\u2019t want to do it, step down. \n\n\nBut I do think it\u2019s weird that brides still want their bridesmaids to match exactly. \ud83e\udd2e", "Aggressively NTA, why TF are people so ridiculous about what other people wear on their weddings?!?!? I had one of those wedding thingies and told people they could show up in jorts if they wanted. But in your case, when it\u2019s your close sister and extra important to you, it\u2019s so sad your sister isn\u2019t prioritizing you looking and feeling your best! I really hope she has a change of heart!", "NTA\n\nYour not a prop, your a person who has trauma from your childhood regarding your identity, family and sexuality.\n\nIts not just a dress. Its about the expectation that you need to conform to their ideals on what you should be and how you should look again.\n\nYou didn't force Mindy to take you in. She chose to do that, and you can be grateful and appreciative, just as you can and are allowed to opt out of doing things that would make you uncomfortable.\n\nYou offered several compromises. If its a dress or bust then I would stand down. If aesthetics and uniformed bridesmaids are more important then she can have that, but without you.", "NTA. If you had been super inflexible about what you're willing to wear I could see an argument for ESH, but it doesn't sound like you were. Modern bridal brands offer many options and you could certainly find a nice suit or jumpsuit in the same colors as the rest of the bridal party. It works even better because you're the MoH, they often wear something slightly different. Your sister just doesn't want to rock the boat with your family's homophobic, regressive church. Honestly the fact that she's getting married there tells you a lot. Good job sticking to your guns. I'd recommend one last good clear talk where you reiterate that you're happy to wear any color or style as long as it isn't a dress, and that if that doesn't work for her you won't attend the wedding. Love and acceptance doesn't end when it's inconvenient. You may find that it's time for some distance from her, and that you'll need to build a family for yourself outside of your biological family. I'm sorry, that's really hard.", "NTA.  \"Mindy just wants her day to be perfect.\"  Her day can be perfect with you in a tux or jumpsuit or suit.  She really needs to think about her priorities if what you wear is a make or break issue.  Sorry your family is so toxic.", "NAH. Try to talk with Mindy when you are both feeling more calm. Sometimes it is hard to let go of your \" vision\" of your wedding. Or even just part of it. For what it is worth, a suit in the same color as the bridesmaids dresses with a slim cut jacket and high waisted wide leg pants could be super elegant.", "IDK. I can see both sides. By not wearing a dress, you are basically saying to your sister that I do not care about you and what you did to support me for many years and I don't care about your feelings. I can see how it hurts her by you rejecting her request. But I understand how uncomfortable it is for you to actually wear that dress and be in front of all of those people who have rejected you. I wonder if potentially ruining your relationship with your sister is worth it to either not to go or to wear a dress? You said you had therapy. Instead of asking us, can you ask your therapist about this?", "Yta, she did so much for you when you needed someone the most to support you. Now just for one day you can't do her a favor. That really sucks!!  What would you have done if she wasn't there for you? Time to repay and be there for her.", "Well,, soft YTA because no one  is comfortable in wedding attire. Ye ever wear a tux, its not the most comfortable thing. Hell, unless its a fancy occasion, I am in shorts and a v neck t-shirt. But I wore a shirt and tie for Grannys dinner at an upscale restaurant even though I wasn't comfortable. IF you have severe anxiety about the dress, tell her you identify as he/him and she should treat you like she would a brother therefore you would be a groomsman but if her fianc\u00e9 doesn't want you as a groomsman then you can just be a guest. But, its apparent that your sis really loves you and took you in which  probably effected her \"comfort\". Did you consider wearing the dress for the wedding and pics only then your choice for reception.", "I don't think you are the bad guy to a certain extent, in my case sometimes I think you have to make sacrifices, throw away your principles, shut up and put on a smile and be there for your sister at her wedding..... BUT I feel like she's so insistent that you wear the dress just so her special day isn't ruined by her homophobic parents (and her shitty church).\r  \nIt's very difficult in your case, I don't think you are the bad guy, I feel you should shut up and accept the dress, but also that no since she is only asking you to do it to please her parents, in my case the only thing I could recommend is that you don't go to the wedding, tell your sister that you understand her point...you just want her day to be special, but you could save the drama and not go.\r  \nBest wishes and may everything go well.", "Conversion therapy? WTF. I'm not sure what it is called, but there are slacks that look like dresses. I'm sure you'd be able to get a seamstress to make you something like that if it is so damn important for her and you want to keep the peace. In my opinion you do you. Bridesmaid clothing make little sense to me. Something you can't wear again is just wasteful. There are brides who get wedding brain so if you are open to it and she is continue the relationship. Not excusing it at all.", "Wear a Dress for 1 day for your sister...she took alot of shit for protecting u...its the least you can do is make her happy....YTA and selfish me oriented", "I mean I absolutely agree that OP shouldn't have to wear a dress, but this is a nonsense point? it's literally Mindy's wedding, this day matters a whole lot more to her than it does anyone else. \"one day doesn't matter\" is directed to those for whom this is just a regular day, aka wedding guests", "You've got it backwards, the sister is the one damaging the relationship by trying to force OP back into a dress in the place where she was previously forced into dresses and abused for who she is. She was the one shaking and screaming. OP offered lots of reasonable compromises, there are plenty of weddings where a member of the bridal party wears a nice suit or jumpsuit in the same color as the rest of the party.", "What really firmly pushed me into NTA territory  is that OP offered to wear the dress for the ceremony and photos, then change for the reception, and her sister shot that down because it would draw too much attention.", "It's not (entirely) about physical comfort.\n\nIt's about...... I have no idea how to explain dysphoria to someone who doesn't experience it..... but it's like, a really strong emotional reaction\n\nI've worn suits and ties and yes, they're not exactly something I would lounge in, but at least they don't make my stomach squirm with revulsion whenever I catch a glimps of my reflexion the way femme clothes do.", "And those pictures will be hung in places of pride and trotted out to everybody who'll look with a \"And look at OP. Doesn't she look so pretty when she makes a little effort? It's a shame she doesn't dress femininely more often, but oh well, at least we got her in a dress for sister's wedding :P\"", "Personally I don't think I would ever be able to look at my sister the same way if she pulled that shit on me\\*, so the relationship has already taken a hit.\n\n\\*emotionally blackmailed me into dressing up femme to a wedding held in my homophobic childhood church, I mean.", "S'not weird, but if you want your bridesmaid to wear matching dresses, then imho, you don't ask your very butch sister with religious trauma to be in your bridal party."]}
