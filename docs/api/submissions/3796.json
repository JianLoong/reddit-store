I (25F) was raised in an extremely religious household. Growing up, I never felt overly feminine. Not as if I wasn\u2019t a girl, but I was never into dresses or makeup or anything like that. If I wanted to wear slacks to church, I would get screamed at. I wore dresses growing up (not just to church, but school) and always felt super uncomfortable. Around 15, I came out as a lesbian and my parents did not approve. I\u2019m not saying all lesbians dress like this, but I did tend to start wearing jeans, t-shirts, etc to school, slacks and nice shirts to events. I finally felt comfortable. My mom and I got into many arguments over this and my dad constantly told me that I was making a big deal over nothing.\n\nI was kicked out at 16 when I refused conversion therapy. My older sister, Mindy,  took me in and was the only one in my family who ever truly supported me. I lived with her all through college. I live with my girlfriend now, but Mindy and I maintained a very close relationship.\n\nMindy is engaged and getting married next summer. She asked me to be the maid of honor. We went shopping for her dress last weekend and she looks stunning! We went with two of her other bridesmaids. We just had an appointment for Mindy\u2019s dress but while the saleswoman was ringing everything up, the  bridesmaids and Mindy started looking at dresses for the bridal party. Nothing definite, but they got ideas on what to look for. Later, in private, I spoke to Mindy and reminded her I\u2019m not comfortable in a dress. I offered an alternative of wearing a tux or suit. We could even find one the same color of the bridesmaids.\n\nMindy said it was one day, couldn\u2019t I just wear a dress? She claimed a tux would make me look like a groomsmen (I have a pixie cut and due to my lack of makeup, I often get mistaken for a guy, especially when out with my very feminine girlfriend). I said I really wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. Plus a lot of our family is going to come which already makes me anxious. It\u2019s already going to be hard, in the same church that told me I was going to hell, surrounded by my family who said similar. Wearing a dress will make me feel like that teenager who had no control of their life and ended up in extensive therapy for having to conform to be loved.\n\n**EDIT: Putting this here as I think people usually skip over them at the bottom and I\u2019m getting the same \u201cwear a jumpsuit\u201d over and over again in spite of my edit. I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors. I also tried to make compromises on wearing the dress for pictures and the ceremony and then changing but she said that\u2019s too dramatic and it\u2019ll draw attention. It\u2019s wear the dress or bust. To add, I\u2019d also have to pay for a dress I\u2019d never wear again versus, I would wear a jumpsuit or suit or tux again.**\n\nIt escalated into a fight, where Mindy said I had to wear a dress, called me selfish and ungrateful. She told me she gave up her early 20s to help take care of me and now I can\u2019t do this. She was shaking and screaming. I told her this was too much and I just won\u2019t come at all.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 has called me several times, saying Mindy wants to apologize, it\u2019s not a big deal, if I just wear the dress it\u2019ll go away.  Mindy just wants her day to be perfect. AITA for refusing to give in?\n\nEdit: I showed examples of tuxes, jumpsuits and regular suits that would compliment the colors.

I don't blame you for not wanting to attend this event.", "Tldr; NAH. Talk to each other calmly and figure it out. \n\n\nI'm feeling a very NAH vibe. You are valid in the way you feel and what not only your family, but the community you grew up in put you through. Your sister did do a lot for you in terms of giving you a support system and taking you in. That is part of the reason you are so close now. She didn't have to do that, but she chose to. I mean you are who she wants as her MOH probably because y'all are so close. She of all people should see how this is making you feel as well as knowing you well enough to know how this would affect you. But at the same time if Mindy is having her ceremony at the same church and will have a lot of family there I can see why she would want you in a dress. I imagine those people have not changed at all since you last saw them and is either getting outside pressure about non-attendance if xyz isn't \"traditional\" She also may be worrying about them calling you out verbally or potentially physically (idk your family or their history) for \"ruining\" your sisters holy matrimony celebration, for being \"dressed like a man\" or whatever other hateful nonsense they spew. So I can 100% see how she would want you there as you are probably the closest person she has, but not wanting to cause any drama with anyone that is to attend. Some wedding venues and churches also have a specific rules and dress codes that must be adhered to or they will not allow the wedding to be held there. (A friend of mine got married in a local church and the priest had to personally approve all attire to be sure that it would not be \"offensive to God\") Also wedding planning is stressful as hell without the prospect of potential drama so throw that in the mix and she's probably a walking ball of nerves right now. I think you both should sit down and revisit this conversation when you are both calm enough to hear the other out on what, how, and WHY this is such an ordeal. Then from there y'all can figure out a solution together.", "Gay man here, gently YTA. I get that your parents sucked and were controlling over what you could wear as a kid. I understand the freedom of not having to conform to those outdated gender stereotypes. However, its one day to do something nice for your sister, the woman who took you in after the rest of your family kicked you out. Yes you don't like dresses in your normal life, but this day isn't about you. Is not wearing a dress for one day really worth damaging your relationship with your sister?", "NTA.

I'm not a fan either, but there are some moments in life when you do things you don't like for bigger goals or for your love ones. We can't live running away of everything we dislike.\n\nAsk yourself if you're willing to risk damaging a relationship with your beloved sister for a dress in her wedding.\n\nAnd before someone says why 'the Bride is evil, she's forcing a dress' ... Well... As far as I'm concerned the bride always have a say in what the maid of honor is gonna wear in her wedding.", "YTA. I really don\u2019t understand the Reddit mob outrage that no one should ever do anything ever that made them uncomfortable.

Have the upper portion removed to make a separate top you can wear and pair with wide legged slacks made from the lower half and/or coordinated supplemental fabric.

However, by having me wear a dress so no one makes a scene or a comment (which ultimately, knowing my family, someone would)...is bending to them.\n\nTo me, my compromise was going period. I never told her this, but once she informed me she had invited our parents and was getting married in the same church that tried to get me to attend conversion therapy, I did debate not going. I am no contact with my parents, we haven't seen or spoken to each other in about 3 years. I obviously have a lot of trauma related to religion in general, specifically that church. In the end, I changed my mind because she has done so much for me and showed support. And it's her day in that sense, she can invite whoever she wants, get married wherever she wants, I would never ask her to change that. She has chosen to maintain a relationship with these people and stay in the church, which I would never judge or ask her to stop.\n\nAt this point, I feel I've done all the compromising I should have to. I'm putting up with people who do not like me, who think I'm going to hell. Who, regardless of what I wear, will likely whisper about me and my girlfriend.

She doesn't want you to disappear.\n\nI suggest you try to change how you think about wearing a dress at this wedding.  It's not an act of surrender.  It's an act of **defiance** to your shitty family.  They didn't accept you.  They want you gone.  They want to slander you to the guests.  If you do show up nothing would make them happier than for you to show how \"different and difficult\" you are.  They wanted to change you, abuse you and deny who you are.\n\nBut you sister said no.  Her actions must have caused drama between her and them.  Perhaps she never said anything about it.  They wanted you to disappear and she said no then and is saying no now.  \n\nYou wouldn't be wearing the dress for your shitty homophobic family, or their shitty homophobic guests.  When that shitty aunt comes up and says \"You look so nice, why was this so hard?\" you answer with: \"I'm doing this for my sister, who loves me as I am.  I'm not doing this for a bunch of hateful bigots.\"  You'd be wearing the dress because Mindy loves you, not because your family hates you.  \n\nI point out a few other ideas: as the MOH, you get to give a toast.

Being kicked out because you're queer is hell and not trying to knock that, but women and girls often automatically are at a disadvantage in many religious groups. \n\nThe fact the sister is willing to throw away the relationship with OP because OP won't do something in an environment around her abusers that could make her substantially more stressed or triggered is REALLY messed up.
