I never liked alcohol I always said \" it burns, it tastes bad and it makes me sick\" so always avoided events like parties and such with them. I always had toc are for their messy selves after parties where that had too much. \n\nWhen it come to my wedding I specifically put on the invites \"no alcohol will be served on the day off\" \nA lot of my friends asked me why and I told them all the reasons above also I am marrying in a Muslim family so I think it would be disrespectful. \n\nI thought everything was great but on my wedding day as I was circling the tables during lunch time I noticed that two tables had expensive wines, whiskeys, and other very expensive liquor bottles. \nI was shook , angry and scared that my new relatives would see it so I asked the servers to quietly take them away from the tables and make sure no alcohol is served anymore and to pour the rest of the bottles in the sinks. \n\nMaybe 30minutes later one of my male christian friends let's call him Adam came to me visibly pissed off. He told me he had brought expensive alcohol and can't find the bottles anywhere and the others told him they were taken away I told him what happened above and he got quiet and said he had to leave. \n\nWhen I came back from my honeymoon. I saw an envelope taped to my door. When me and my husband opened it, it had an invoice for all the bottles that were at my wedding. I was shook and called Adam asking him WTF ? He said I should pay for the bottles I made the servers pour and I refused because I already said before hand No Alcohol. He called me an asshole for inviting christian friends and not letting them having alcohol and for not paying for the waste.\n\n\nAITA for having an alcohol free wedding ?? Can't people have fun without it ?\n\nInfo : why didn't I just tell Adam to leave with his booze? Adam is my close friend's husband he got into the friend group after their wedding. We always try not to inconvenience him because he throws fits and specially when he drinks. That day I actually was surprised he didn't say anything and just left. \n\nUpdate: a few comments in and my husband has also been reading them and we will be paying for the bottles as we have the means to.

By that logic, it would only be fair that if the bride at a \"phone-free\" wedding saw a guest taking photos, she could take the phone and destroy it. I agree that it was not at all appropriate for Adam to bring the alcohol, but it would have been much simpler to remove it from the table and allow Adam to retrieve his alcohol after the wedding.", "She didn\u2019t know whose it was. Best to just get rid of it herself rather than wait to offend her religious family.", "Who would have been in charge of that? The venue is not going to assume that responsibility so OP or someone in the bridal party would have to do it. How is that fair?", "It wasn\u2019t a problem for OP. It\u2019s a problem for Adam. He\u2019s the one that\u2019s out money. If he stops being friends with OP because of this, that\u2019s probably for the best. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend anyway.", "Again, OP didn\u2019t know it was Adam who brought the alcohol. Did you expect them to interrogate all of their guests until someone took responsibility for the alcohol? Also, OP didn\u2019t steal anything. It was OP\u2019s wedding and something was present that they made clear shouldn\u2019t be there so they had it removed.", "I would.  I drink seldom and very little when I do, but it takes the edge off and helps me relax.  Dry weddings are fearsomely boring affairs unless you're very close to the couple.", "People crash weddings all the time and not all vendors/staff are honest so that\u2019s extremely dumb to expect you can just leave \u201cexpensive belongings\u201d laying around.\n\n\nAnd she didn\u2019t steal. She simply disposed of that which was not allowed. Almost like they shouldn\u2019t have brought it.", "No. No alcohol means no alcohol.", "No alcohol will be served means NO ALCOHOL WILL BE SERVED even by your sad alcoholic guest.", "That\u2019s a poor comparison. Usually the phone would be on the owner\u2019s person so if the host of a phone free wedding saw a guest with a phone, they could easily ask them to put it away. This alcohol was just sitting on the tables and OP wanted it gone. Why should OP take responsibility for the alcohol when it wasn\u2019t supposed to be there in the first place.", "False comparison", "I mean, you made the rules, why shouldn't you be the one to enforce it?", "Her wedding invite was shit. She should have said that this is a dry wedding instead of saying that none will be served because that leaves it open to interpretation as to whether it is BYOB. \nHis stuff was taken and he can take her to court over it.", "If you see expensive property you at least don\u2019t destroy it. It\u2019s common sense. You could confiscate the alcohol until someone ask for it and then ask them to leave if they want to drink. Stealing is never right.", "They could have asked the table to remove the wine or asked a server to take it out of sight.", "Then don\u2019t go?????\n\n\nI went to a dry wedding this year and had a wonderful time. Wasn\u2019t close to the couple. But then I used therapy for my anxiety, not alcohol, and I can function well in a social situation \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing but in my country destroy personal belongings means stealing.", "It didn't say that on the invite though, did it? No alcohol was served!\ud83e\udd23", ">they could easily ask them to put it away.\n\nPrecisely. Why couldn't OP have done the same with the alcohol? If she didn't know it belonged to Adam, she could have put it away and told him he could retrieve it after the wedding once he confronted her about it.", "How so?", "OP did enforce the rule, you just don\u2019t like how they did it.", "If the wedding was BYOB, the invitation would have said that.", "Have you ever hosted a wedding before? If not, let me tell you how this works. Most venues don\u2019t allow outside food or booze to be served so the staff at OP\u2019s wedding wouldn\u2019t have taken responsibility for guarding it during the wedding. That means someone else would have had to take responsibility for the alcohol during the wedding. Why should anyone have to go through that just because a guest decided to break the rules?", "Most venues don\u2019t allow outside food or beverages so the staff wasn\u2019t going to take responsibility for the holding onto the alcohol. OP would have had to get someone in the bridal party or another guest to hold onto the booze and that wouldn\u2019t have been fair.", "Lol, why not?  Often it's an obligation to go; other times it makes things more enjoyable sooner than they normally would be.\n\nI'm naturally reserved; it is what it is.  It's fine in business situations but not fun.", "And alcohol is hardly a personal belonging if you\u2019ve already distributed your bottles amongst multiple tables to be shared by guests. (At a place where it\u2019s disallowed no less!)", "It\u2019s implied.", "Who would have held onto the alcohol until the person who brought it could be identified? It wouldn\u2019t have been the staff at the venue. That\u2019s a liability issue for them. Why should a member of the bridal party or a guest have to spend the day waiting for someone to claim alcohol that they shouldn\u2019t have brought?", "The alcohol was sitting around, on multiple tables, with nobody watching it. Free to be disposed of. Quite different from taking a phone out of someone\u2019s hands and smashing it, which would be destruction of property.", "She could just ask the alcohol to be confiscated until someone ask for it. It\u2019s clearly that Adam is a huge AH but op is an AH too for stealing.", "There were only two tables together with the expensive bottles. Again, two wrong don\u2019t make one right. Stealing it\u2019s wrong and she should pay for the bottles she destroyed.", "That entirely depends on the venue. If the alcohol was still unclaimed by the end of the night, *then* I can justify pouring it out or throwing it away.", "Even if it was my alcohol-free wedding, I would never pour out bottles of alcohol that guest's brought in. That seems like I'm begging for trouble. The alcohol should have never been brought in, I agree with that. I disagree with OP's reaction. That being said, I'm tired of entertaining debates. I hope you have a great day.", "Again, the venue staff was not going to take on that responsibility. It\u2019s a liability issue.", "Two is still multiple \ud83d\ude09 \nAnd she didn\u2019t steal, they were distributed and not allowed. Therefore they were disposed of.", "No venue is going to allow its staff to take responsibility for someone else\u2019s property. It\u2019s a liability issue.", "I was at a wedding this year which was held at a venue that didn\u2019t allow alcohol at all (Christian rec center, funny enough!) and they would have disposed of the alcohol. I think it\u2019s fine. \n\n\n(And this also demonstrates that equating \u201cChristian\u201d to \u201cneeds alcohol at a wedding\u201d is off base.)"]}
