They wanted a reception and you didn't so they have strong armed you into doing what they want.\n\nThe ideal would've been to have said no right from the word go and no correspondence entered into.\n\nTheir behaviour is very passive aggressive.\n\nYou need to sit down with your husband and decide just how much control his family is going to allow over the two (soon to be three) of you.  The will likely tell you how to parent and what you should be doing and buying for your child so bear this in mind.  You may have to lower the contact once the kid is born.\n\nAt this point I would probably just let things happen.  Let them plan it and you just turn up in your comfiest outfit that you can have at 7-8 months pregnant.  Sit back and enjoy the meal and your non alcoholic drink and then leave early because you're tired... make sure your husband goes with you.\n\nAlso make sure your MIL is not in the birth suite with you when the kid is born.", "Info- did the in-laws also pay for the first wedding?", "YTA. Just let them do everything and show up and be the bride. This is essentially what men do.", "YTA: for wanting to just cancel after they put a great deal of time, energy, and money into the event, rather than trying to postpone or move up the date. \n\nI get it. I don\u2019t know how far along you are, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be 8 months pregnant at my wedding either. You never know if the bang will come early, or you\u2019d be on bed rest or have complications, etc. \n\nBut cancelling 2 weddings on them isn\u2019t a great look.", "Yta. You created all this drama with how you canceled and eloped on the first place and now you are still making everything about you and causing even more drama. You have a life with your husband, future child and in laws ahead of you and y\u2019all all need to figure out how to talk with one another.", "Gonna go against the grain here, but NTA.  You\u2019re already married.  The important part is done.  Sounds to me like your main focus has been on your marriage, and now on your growing family, rather than on a single wedding day.  And it sounds like your husband\u2019s priority has been the same, despite whatever comments his family members might have been making about that.  \n\nIf family members would like to throw a party to celebrate your marriage, that\u2019s cool.  But you don\u2019t need a wedding.  You\u2019ve already had YOUR wedding.  And don\u2019t let anyone try to convince you otherwise.  Congrats, OP, and many happy returns!", "Yes, YTA.\n\nYou cancelled your first wedding with 2-3 months notice because you eloped. Costing thousands of dollars in non refundable costs to your in-laws, and probably upsetting a bunch of travel and other plans.\n\nYour in-laws generously moved on from that slight and volunteered to celebrate you in July and you agreed. Now, rather than move the date up so that you can be celebrated earlier in your pregnancy, you're talking about cancelling this again, costing more thousands of dollars, rejecting the generosity of your in-laws etc.\n\nYou don't owe anyone a big wedding celebration, but if you accept 2, cancelling the second will cause bad blood and that will put your marriage and family unit at risk.", "YTA\n\nIf it was your money lost I very much doubt you would simply cancel rather than working with vendors to reschedule or get refunds for unusual circumstances.", "Don't cancel. The inlaws can attend the July wedding without OP. Problem solved. OP avoids the big wedding she didn't want, inlaws have the big party that they wanted. How can anyone with sense force a 7-8 months pregnant woman to have a wedding party?", "YTA\n\nYou're complaining about drama as if it wasn't your actions that caused it. \n\nIt really isn't just about the money. Time and energy go into these things, and people have to get time off work for you to blow it all up.\n\nPay back the money and be done with it. Won't fix everything, but oh well.", "NTA. \n\nYou very obviously don\u2019t want a wedding. Stop trying to appease his family and firmly tell them that no, you won\u2019t be moving the wedding up because you\u2019re not going to be having one AT ALL. \n\nYour in-laws sound a bit controlling. Let them know now that that kind of behavior isn\u2019t going to fly with you. \n\nBut at the same time- did they put deposits down for the wedding? If so, you need to reimburse them for every penny they\u2019re out.", "NTA\n\nLol what are these responses. You were guilted into a wedding and now have the most ultimate excuse to get out of it.\n\nIf you just found out, you\u2019re due in August if not earlier. Fuck the stress and travel not to mention the whole expectations as a bride of a wedding a month before your due date. *You might not even be cleared to go by your doctor depending on your health.*\n\nIf they can\u2019t get their deposits back, offer to repay them. *Do not offer to let this be your baby shower.*\n\nYou clearly do not vibe with this and you *do not need the stress in this delicate time.*\n\nCongratulations. A baby is so amazing. But the journey to it (and right after) is something else.\n\n*You only worry about you and baby in this time.*", "ESH\n\nIt doesn't sound like you eloped because that's what you wanted as much as to avoid working through whatever drama you were having with your now (then future) family. \n\nYou can't just avoid situations and hope everything resolves itself. \n\nThen you allow them to provide a new wedding, again - to avoid actually confronting whatever drama existed. But I'm still not clear you even want this wedding. \n\n But you agreed to it, and weddings aren't the kind of thing you just play with on the calendar. Typically the date is planned pretty far in advance. I'm not clear on the timing though, when are you due? Is a July wedding even possible? Have you expressed to them that you're pregnant? \n\nYour husband sucks because he isn't standing up for you, or seemingly providing any advocacy at all. So I'm not clear what his role in this is. It seems like he's just going along with what you or his mom is telling him. \n\nHis family sucks because they seem to just want their wedding, they don't seem to be caring what you want.  \n\nBut really ESH because it sounds like a whole lot of passive aggressive avoidance behavior so of course there was drama last year, because everyone is just doing what they want with little consideration for the rest of the family. \n\nThis is your family too now, you can't just avoid them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like you never actually intended to have this wedding and was just looking for an excuse to cancel.  Also once you are married you can't have a wedding.  A reception sure, but no wedding.  You never should have agreed.  You also need to reimburse what they've lost on both weddings due to your decisions.  I really hope you learn how to make decisions you will stand by before the baby comes.", "YTA", "So, you're going to be,  what? 8 months pregnant? Do they not understand how tired and uncomfortable you're going to be at that point? Pay then back and stop scheduling the \"ceremony \" until and unless you can commit and pay for it yourself.", "YTA. Your post history suggests there is way more to this. Regardless you\u2019re purposely being difficult and costing your in-laws a lot of money. I don\u2019t know how you expect to have any kind of decent relationship with them after this.", "ESH.\n\nBut only because they are offering to move it up. They're trying to compromise and make it easier for you, and you're cancelling again even though it's the *second* time they have tried to make it work.\n\nIf you hadn't agreed already, you wouldn't be an asshole. If you had a reason to decline moving the date up other than \"don't wanna,  some of the people are being brusque\", you wouldn't be the asshole. If you pay back what they put into both weddings and sincerely apologize, you would be less of an asshole but still assholish. \n\nAnd your BIL is a massive one; his comments are not helpful and he's acting like a jerk. That needs to be addressed separately from the whole wedding question. Why is your husband allowing the man to talk shit without checking him? You can certainly stand up for yourself, but being that it's his brother's nasty mouth, he should be volunteering to assist.", "Wow. I can understand not wanting to have a big celebration in your honour (I hate to call it a \"wedding\" because that's when you get married - you're already wed) when you're, what, 8 months pregnant or so? I can imagine that would be uncomfortable! So I can see your side of it.\n\nBut I can see theirs, too. \n\nINFO: Is this going to be a \"mock wedding\" complete with vows and everything? Or just a fancy party to celebrate?\n\nI honestly can't decide if you're the AH or not. Is there any way to tone down the fanciness of the celebration and still have it, so you will still be comfortable enough to attend?", "Your husband should be telling them that it is your combined decision as a married couple, not just your decision", "i mean honestly it sounds like you don't actually want to be part of his family. does that seem like a fair assessment?", "You got married, so just have a reception and call it good. If they want to foot that bill fine if not then they can drop it and you can move a long. The in laws sound kind of hard to please. You need as little stress in your life right now as possible, so they need to relax. NTAH.", "ESH. It does not sound like you want this wedding, pregnant or not. You should have been honest about this. Your in-laws are assholes because  you had a wedding. It wasn't the one they wanted.  Your in- laws should be able to get refunds this far out. Cancel the wedding. Do not have a wedding but maybe an anniversary party you and DH pay for and plan yourselves if and only if you really want to do a party.", "YTA. Say yes or say no and stick with it. You agreed to this wedding, it costs you nothing, just go with it. \n\nAlternatively, you could ask if they'd consider turning it into a family reunion instead. It's possible that's really what they wanted here, and it's a good compromise if they are to it. But if they don't agree, just go with it. Put on a dress, walk down the aisle, say I do, and enjoy the food. A wedding is only as much trouble as you put into it.", "YTA for not making a choice and sticking with it. If you didn\u2019t want a wedding you should\u2019ve said no, because weddings are expensive and you\u2019re wasting their time and money. I can see why they\u2019d be upset about that. Also, your husband should also have a choice about his wedding too, it\u2019s not all about you OP.", "YTA - I mean you let them pay for two weddings and then cancelled them. Id think you were an AH too. \n\nIf you dont want this wedding, dont have one and stop accepting their money.", "NTA\n\n  \nYOu already eloped. Stop letting the inlaws push you into a wedding for them.\n\n  \nYou don't want a wedding, just make it a HARD NO.", "I would've still cancelled it even if I was the one paying", "Pregnant women go to weddings all the time. The only difference is she has to walk down the aisle. They're doing everything else.", "Yes, this! And, if there is this much drama now and avoidance with confrontation, it will be so much worse when you add in a baby! Everyone needs to learn to communicate NOW!", "How is OP looking for an excuse. She got pregnant. If she was looking for an excuse to cancel being ~8 months pregnant is a great one. I wouldn\u2019t want a wedding when I am 8 months pregnant as well. I don\u2019t know OP, or the situation however, she couldn\u2019t have known she would be pregnant when they  started planned it. \n\nOP is already married, this wedding is not needed. Let\u2019s be honest, the in-laws didn\u2019t organize the wedding for OP and their son, they did it for themselves.\n\n(Edit: forgot a word)", "Why can\u2019t you have a wedding after you\u2019re married? I know a lot of people who did this particularly during COVID. Actually most weddings I have been to the official marriage is not actually at the wedding itself because it\u2019s just another logistically hassle. It\u2019s not a legal wedding but who cares? Agree with the verdict but no reason to gatekeep weddings.", "I think that\u2019s why the MIL suggested moving the wedding up\u2026", "Why do I feel like the family drama she's talking about is herself. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEither way oh boi, their family most likely had a great juicy gossip this Christmas and new year.", "No", "It costs her nothing except the experience of going through a massive, stressful wedding production with <2 months until baby arrives. If she just found out she\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019s probably looking at an August-September due date. That is a non-negligible detail that MASSIVELY impacts the event that she agreed to.\n\nIt is highly unfortunate that this would be the second cancellation, and I don\u2019t fault the in-laws at all for any upset they might have had over the first. But OP is almost definitely going to be 8+ months pregnant by the time this (symbolic) wedding happens, and I cannot hold her not wanting to do it against her. Assuming the in laws are aware of the pregnancy, NTA for me. (If they are not, OP needs to immediately let them know, because backing out with no apparent reason *again* is going to cause problems that might never be fixed.)", "Then paying the parents back their gift would be the right thing to do.", "Get pregnant and walk down the aisle in her place, then. Show her how its done, and how much of T A she is being.", "Yep, this is so true! Everyone loves babies, but they seem to make people loose their minds. I thought we had a good understanding of expectations with our families when my husband and I had our son. But somehow the drama still found us and that is not what you need when you are sleep deprived. Work through this stuff now instead of all of the avoidance behavior.", "Because a wedding is literally save event at which people get married, by definition.", "According to OP in her previous AITA post, the family drama is that her stepsister was upset that they were going to have the same in-laws and OP said that she should cancel her engagement if it bothered her that much.\n\nOP, if you wanted your in-laws to like you, you shouldn\u2019t have eloped after they paid for your wedding (I\u2019m assuming that you didn\u2019t pay for any of it because no one pays for a huge wedding then cancels it to elope), and you absolutely shouldn\u2019t have accepted their offer to pay for a second one. This newest post makes it clear why your stepsister didn\u2019t want to share in-laws with you btw.", "but it seems like you've put a fair bit of effort into avoiding them or avoiding getting involved with them. here's the mom offering to move up the wedding for you, that seems pretty generous. what is it about the idea of them having a wedding ceremony to celebrate your partnership that you want to avoid?  \nWhen you summarize things as \"drama\" it makes it a bit hard to understand your position. I'm having trouble understanding why you called the inital wedding off, which makes it hard to figure out what might be best for you.", "That makes...zero sense. I'm not sure what point you're even trying to make."]}
