Typically the date is planned pretty far in advance. I'm not clear on the timing though, when are you due? Is a July wedding even possible? Have you expressed to them that you're pregnant? \n\nYour husband sucks because he isn't standing up for you, or seemingly providing any advocacy at all. So I'm not clear what his role in this is. It seems like he's just going along with what you or his mom is telling him. \n\nHis family sucks because they seem to just want their wedding, they don't seem to be caring what you want.  \n\nBut really ESH because it sounds like a whole lot of passive aggressive avoidance behavior so of course there was drama last year, because everyone is just doing what they want with little consideration for the rest of the family. \n\nThis is your family too now, you can't just avoid them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not like I can magically give Nick a new family so I don\u2019t get why she keeps bringing it up but it\u2019s annoying and I\u2019ve asked her to drop it multiple times already.\n\nShe even complains in front of our future in-laws which I feel like she only does since things are still rocky between me and them. The last time she brought it up in front of them I suggested she cancel her wedding which only triggered her more and now she\u2019s convinced I only got engaged as some big master plan to fuck up her engagement which is dumb. She\u2019s been telling everybody and some of our family are starting to believe her because of me telling her to cancel her wedding. Alex, who I was actually close to, is also mad at me because she\u2019s convinced him I was being serious.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she doesn't want a wedding - which is ultimately the truth of her behavior - she should say it outright and not let her family plan two weddings for her. AH for not being truthful.", ">Lol what are these responses.\n\nGood ones, calling out OP for being fickle and wasteful with other people's money, instead of blowing smoke up her ass like you.", "Twice!", "You're just as bad as his family", "Well live that truth then. Pay back every deposit and fee that was lost with wedding #1, as well as everything lost the second time round. YTA otherwise. No wonder there's always drama around you... (you *are* the drama)", "Then pay your in-laws back every penny they lost because of you, both with the first and second cancelled event. And pay all of it back to them within the next year! And try some maturing! You accepted their offer then backed out twice, of course they are offended, and by the way you seem to be the reason why there's always drama, good luck to your husband, in-laws because they need it with you in the family.", "Well this is revealing. What a shock that drama seems to follow her around.", ">Why do I feel like the family drama she's talking about is herself. \ud83d\ude02\n\nWell, maybe because the in-laws don't like her because of previous break up. Check out OP's post from 8 months ago. She dated the guy before then they broke up 3 years ago, and got together again like a year ago.", "YTA... You don't sound mature enough to get married, and you certainly can't be financially responsible, or you'd understand their agitation. Please figure it out before you have your baby.", "No what?", "On and off relationship, 2 events paid by the in-laws cancelled because rushing into marriage and a baby almost right after getting back together, no mentioning in the post of what her husband would want regarding the events, dude is just doing what OP says... I start to see why the in-laws aren't fond of OP, and OP and her husband's relationship. Lots of drama \n\nOP's post from 8 months ago:\n\n^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
