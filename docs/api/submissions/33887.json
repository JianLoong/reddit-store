Typically the date is planned pretty far in advance. I'm not clear on the timing though, when are you due? Is a July wedding even possible? Have you expressed to them that you're pregnant? \n\nYour husband sucks because he isn't standing up for you, or seemingly providing any advocacy at all. So I'm not clear what his role in this is. It seems like he's just going along with what you or his mom is telling him. \n\nHis family sucks because they seem to just want their wedding, they don't seem to be caring what you want.  \n\nBut really ESH because it sounds like a whole lot of passive aggressive avoidance behavior so of course there was drama last year, because everyone is just doing what they want with little consideration for the rest of the family. \n\nThis is your family too now, you can't just avoid them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You dont waste thousands of other peoples money TWICE on something you agreed to, then jerk them around.\n\nYou need therapy for anxiety and avoidant behaviors, not a marriage, baby, or wedding. **Place that on the top of your priority list of nothing else will ever make the top of that list**.\n\nPS: You absolutely are causing problems. Drama is just something you need to learn to navigate. You can't run from it and deal with one thing at a time like you want to. If your anxiety is this bad, your marriage is gonna be a shambles.\n\nEdit: In the very least, your husband can't ever really lean on you because you can barely handle your own *indirect* stressors. That's not a partnership, its a one way dependency. If nothing else motivates you to take your issue seriously, consider that he deserves better. \n\nThe question is, are you going to do something about it before he comes to the same conclusion?

But moving it up is a great compromise. His mom and dad sound decent enough to pay for a celebration. Your BIL is an asshole though.", "He did say it was a joint decision but they still want to blame just me", "OP is already married, therefore the second event is redundant, it is also not for her benefit but for OPs in-laws. You're speaking to her like she owes her in-laws to bow down and do whatever the hell they want. She doesn't owe them sh*t.

At least this OP actually did elope at one point.", "This! Avoidant personality is a serious mental health problem. She could have that. Obviously not enough here for us to determine but at the very least get therapy for the anxious avoidance before it becomes a disorder.", "It sounds like she never wanted the big wedding.

She could have said no, but she didn't.

I officiated my sister\u2019s wedding even though she had gotten eloped during the pandemic. There were hundreds of people present for the wedding ceremony. Although they were not getting legally married they were getting symbolically married. Legal marriage is not the only type of being \u201cmarried\u201d that people recognize. A lot of people consider making a commitment to each other through vows and getting the buy in or your community as an integral part of getting married, much more so than signing some paperwork.
