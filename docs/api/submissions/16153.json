I suspect that getting the leech out of her life would help her stress levels, too.\n\nIf she moves in with you, OP, you can never, ever let the leech stay for even a night.  In fact, I'd not let him into the house at all.  If he gets in it's likely that he'll find a reason why he can't leave, even if he's only there for a visit.  \n\nAlso, sometimes people try to have mail sent to an address where they want to live, to try and prove residency.  Speak with the attorney about these kinds of shenanigans, too.  Leech is likely to get down and dirty.\n\nNTA", "Just a thought...

Do not have him in your home at any cost.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Obviously. \n\nI\u2019m also going to suggest she never move in with you. If she does, she\u2019ll probably invite her husband over to \u201cvisit\u201d or to help her with very valid things (paperwork, money, small jobs, etc). He will then be over at your place all the time. If you tell her he can\u2019t, from the level of enabling you described, she\u2019d probably just sneak him in when you aren\u2019t around. It doesn\u2019t sound like your mother has boundaries or, from your sex toys story, any interest in defending yours, so ask yourself, if she had a key to your place, would she realistically manage to keep him from making a copy? Because he will have lots of great reasons to give her (\u201cwhat if there\u2019s an emergency!\u201d) and a lot of opportunity to borrow it from her when she isn\u2019t looking. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard because you really love your mom and want to care for her as her problems are slowly circling the water around her, but based on the behaviors you described, I doubt that you (or many people close to her) haven\u2019t already tried to address her husband\u2019s appalling behavior and treatment of her. You don\u2019t get this far without a LOT of unhappy conversations. What I am getting at is that you need to confront the fact that there is nothing you can do to save your mother from him or herself. Even if you could persuade her to leave him, it probably wouldn\u2019t stick: the instant people feel discomfort from making a change they don\u2019t truly want for themselves, they\u2019ll run right back to the safety of the shitty-but-familiar, so if she doesn\u2019t wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s toxic than she\u2019s likely going to just waffle between appeasing him and placating you just enough that you\u2019ll keep helping her no matter how much it ultimately hurts you. \n\nAgain, to be clear, I\u2019m not saying give up on loving your mother. I\u2019m saying give up on the plan to move her in and the idea that you can save her. She has to do that herself, and there\u2019s no combination of perfect words and logical arguments you can use to convince her if she doesn\u2019t want to confront the truth.", "this is a really hard situation and I truly feel for everyone involved, but also this makes me nostalgic for when women could just poison their husbands without being caught", "NTA you get to choose your living arrangements, your mothers poor choice is not forced on you.", "If her mom gifts her money away and then gets divorce, a judge will definitely claw back 50% or more. They don\u2019t like you trying to scheme ways around the legal system. \n\nHowever, if she charges her mom rent for a room, puts that money in savings, and stops charging her if/when she can no longer pay\u2026 well then, the mom has done nothing wrong or sneaky.", "Even better!", "NTA. Your mom can\u2019t afford to retire and while that\u2019s a huge bummer, it is also kinda the bed she made for herself by not cutting off her husband years ago. \n\nI would also not allow my mom to move in with that kind of (disgusting) dead weight, no matter how much I love her. She needs to make the hard choices.", "NTA   Honestly...this put me off my salad.   He's a reprehensible human being.   There is only so much you can do and putting yourself in a situation where you have to deal with this vile excuse for a human being on the day to day is too far above and beyond for anyone much less you.   \n\nJust...no.   No.", "Divorce on the grounds of the affairs. Go after him for the MLM loses.", "NTA, but there are other things you can do to protect your mother. Getting APS involved now, getting POA over her finances are things that could really benefit you both. Talk to a lawyer or a social worker.", "So even if he takes half of her 401k, that is still cheaper than keeping him around. Besides, if she is living with you, that means that likely 90% of her bills are covered since she won't need to pay utilities, rent, and likely food. At the end of the day, it's a small price to pay to remove a cancer from your life and hers.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. She chose to get married to that leech. Let her know now you will never allow her to move in with you. So she can plan accordingly. She should look into subsidized senior housing. These places tend to have a wait-list and a spot only opens up when someone dies.", "NTA\n\nWhat if she doesn't go through with a divorce but just separated from him, indefinitely? Is that an option?", "NTA. I\u2019m still reeling from #6, that\u2019s both creepy and gross. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with stuff like that. He doesn\u2019t sound like anyone I would want to live with and I can\u2019t begin to imagine how your mom does it. Be honest and talk to her, tell her how you feel. I hope everything works out!", "NTA.   Yes it\u2019s an ultimatum, but you cannot have that man in your home.  That\u2019s it.  He\u2019s a disgusting individual, and if your mother chooses to stay with him, as she has for the last 15 years, then she\u2019s a fool, sorry.  If her 401k is as meagre as you say, then she would be just as well to cut her losses.  He\u2019s not held down a job in the time they\u2019ve been together, so he\u2019s always benefited from half of her pay.  After retirement, whether she stays with him or leaves him, he will live on half of the 401k.  Do you see my reasoning?  This is assuming that he pursues it, and I don\u2019t know (because I\u2019m in the UK), but would he be entitled to a full 50% of the whole fund, or only 50% of the amount added during the last 15 years they\u2019ve been married, or some other measure?  If she does come to live with you, whatever money she has left she can spend on herself, her own needs, but she will be free of that parasite.  I hope she makes the right decision, but you must enforce that boundary for your own well-being.   NTA", "Your mother chose to stay with that despicable man and now suffer consequences. She should divorce him despite losing half of her 401k. Can she not collect social security also? At least when she leaves him hopefully she\u2019ll have peace of mind.", "NTA this man sounds dangerous please protect yourself!", "NTA but why the fuck is she retiring? You don\u2019t get to stop working until you have enough money or your body/mind gives out.\n\nDon\u2019t imply. Tell your mother your stepfather is banned from your home. If she breaks this rule, she\u2019s out. Full stop.", "NTA to not let husband move in. She is adult and so are you. You both make decisions that are in the best interests of your own home. Let her make hers.  If she wants to live in a tent with him. So be it", "INFO: is your mother aware of the sex toy thing? The rest is more run-of-the-mill icky loser SO stuff, but the stealing of the sex toys is imo WAY slimy and creepy.", "He\u2019s not held down a job since he\u2019s been with her, and has always benefited from half of her income.  When she retires, whatever is in the 401k is split with him whether she stays or leaves, and she would be better off to divorce him for her health and well-being."]}
