If I was your partner, I already wouldn't be thrilled about your mother but her deadbeat husband to boot? I'd be ready to end things. \n\nThis is something that I am surprised I don't see on here more because this is a blended family issue.

In fact, I'd not let him into the house at all.  If he gets in it's likely that he'll find a reason why he can't leave, even if he's only there for a visit.  \n\nAlso, sometimes people try to have mail sent to an address where they want to live, to try and prove residency.  Speak with the attorney about these kinds of shenanigans, too.  Leech is likely to get down and dirty.\n\nNTA", "Just a thought...
