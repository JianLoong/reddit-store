Mom clearly has some serious boundary issues with teenagers that are making her look like an unsafe person for other people\u2019s kids to be around. Even I\u2019m not entirely convinced that she wouldn\u2019t try to flirt with her children\u2019s friends if she saw the opportunity. Adults who seek validation and approval from teenagers to this extent have been known to take it that far.", "My parents were protective though they did let me go to friends house, she had to know my friend and if I stayed over she had to meet at least one of the parents. If a parent did anything like this, I GUARANTEE that I would never be allowed to that house again", "OMG that would have been so awkward for the poor stripper lol.", "She's lucky nobody complained to authority. I'm pretty sure that's going to be considered corrupting a minor or providing obscene content to a minor or something.", "Ok thanks I for some reason thought it was about a deep dish pizza for meals without any veggies", "YES! I was singing that in my head!", "I\u2019m pretty sure that most 16yo kids already have enough sense to not repeat something this disturbing. But they probably told their parents that they were creeped out.", ">Would you report it to HR? \n\nNo I wouldn't, but I take your point.", "He was so scundered. I have never seen a man put on a pair of rip away cop pants so fast.", "Oh, my mum was livid enough when she picked me up and my friend\u2019s mum was drunk off her ass. If we had told anyone it would have been three entire shitshows. The birthday girl and our other friend from primary had been abused by a teacher, my mum was ferociously over-protective, and our other friend\u2019s dad was part of the Iron Hall. He thought line dancing was the devil\u2019s work. Nobody parents (including BG\u2019s dad) would have been happy about a strange man being in the house, pants on or off! \u2026 ok, off would definitely have been worse.", "Why wouldn't you? That would be a totally inappropriate thing for one colleague to do to another, especially if you weren't friends with this person or didn't have the kind of relationship that was open to joking around on that level.", "That is certainly a sentence you wrote there.  Wow.", "Yeah but it doesn't mean I have to be bothered to care enough to be bothered or care."]}
