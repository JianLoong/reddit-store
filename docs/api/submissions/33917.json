One of the things she loved to do was drag out the pictures of me when I was little, including the dance recital when I was four and wearing a poodle costume.  Luckily for me, my friends didn't drop me but just felt sorry for me.  Which also wasn't great.  But you can bet I made every attempt to keep her away from my friends.  It was embarrassing as hell.", "Oh dear, I was going to ask if she\u2019s like the mom in Mean Girls.. but no, she\u2019s worse \ud83d\ude26", "Seeing some of the lyrics to that song in a comment of OP\u2019s honestly not nearly harsh enough.", "Woooow that is not the one I was thinking", "Omg that\u2019s appalling", "yoooo wtf", "Eeeewwwww!\n\nI have always considered myself the \"cool mom\". I'll let you stay up late, we can make brownies at 10 pm, and we'll listen to Mr Brightside and dance around the kitchen when we're having a sleepover\nI'll totally watch whatever teeny bopper movies the kids are into, I'll even tell them stories about being a 90s kid.......\nBut that's just gross and inappropriate", "What. the. fuck. \n\nHonestly, this is beyond \"trying to be cool\" and more in the realm of the aunt actually trying to fuck a high schooler.", "Fucking hell. I'm glad I didn't Google that \ud83d\ude32", "If I were 16 and an adult sang that to me, I would fear getting sexually harassed by them and I'd avoid them at all costs. Would probably tell my parents, too.", "Woah.  That's creepy AF.", "She\u2019s so one of those moms who ends up getting arrested because she buys teens alcohol and lets them party at her house.", "WTF!!! You are NTA and your aunt is lucky she hasn\u2019t received a visit from the police. I guarentee that if a man was singing this to teenagers, there would be serious problems.", "Thank you for not making me look that up. You're my hero.", "Have your mom hear the song and see if she still feels you should apologize. You absolutely have nothing to apologize for. \n\nPS. Update", "It\u2019s apparently not that one. OP answers that it\u2019s this: \n\nHere's the bit that went viral on tiktok:\n\n'Give me one margarita, I'ma open my legs\n\nGive me two margaritas, I'ma give you some head\n\nGive me three margaritas, I'ma put it in my puss\n\nGive me four margaritas, I'ma put it in my tush\n\nGive me five margaritas, I'ma have some fun\n\nGive me five margaritas, I'ma put it in your bun'\n\nSoooooo yeeeeah, ew. She basically sexually harassed a bunch of 16 year olds. It made me feel gross even putting that in a comment.", "I honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she did. That\u2019s just so out of hand in the first place.", "I think a lot of people in the comments here that arent familiar with the song dont realize its was a pretty well know viral trend on TikTok so these kids absolutely knew this song. This was just mom being cringey but the song had a moment on tiktok.", "Yeah, that was my thought like, it's not great, but one of my favorite songs growing up was Tubthumping and that wasn't too bad. Then I looked up the lyrics to the margaritas song and my hair curled.", "I used to be mortified when my friends would be over for dinner and telemarketers would call (before the caller ID days) and my father would pretend he worked at Pizza Hut. \ud83e\udd23", "How would you feel if a teacher sang it to their students?", "Wow what a waste of a great username.", "You're the only one adding on the \"as human beings\" part. Everyone else understands that a parental relationship is not equal.", "A parody is mockery\u2026", "Wait - Sister Cindy and Brother Jed are still around?\n\nDang, they were harassing people at my university in the early 1980s...", "16-year-Olds are absolutely singing this the same way my generation sang The Bad Touch and What's your Fantasy as teens. It's crude and catchy.\n\nWhat they aren't doing is singing this with or around adults. That would definitely be creepy.", "When the male stripper has to be the moral compass of the group, someone has officially messed up.", "Ditto. USC 1984-88.\n\nShe announced the dates for her 2024 HoNoMo Tour on her Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/C1HSu1Cufjk/?igsh=dW1tbDdiaG50ZWE1.", "Well, the smart ones don't sing it with or around adults."]}
