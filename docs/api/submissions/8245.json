He said he is afraid that she will start treating him like an ATM, but he won't let her.\n\nWhen I pressed on the issue more, Mark told me that they had been doing everything 50-50 financially, because that's fair, but Caitlyn now demands more, claiming the babies' stuff cost more.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. So Caitlyn is taking care of 4 months old twins alone all day and Mark is only contributing financially the same amount as Caitlyn's maternity pay, despite making over 6 times as much.\n\nI told Mark that this is not okay and he is borderline acting like a deadbeat. Mark didn't take it well, he started fighting with me, saying that that amount of money is well enough for their family and he will end up using the money he saved up on buying a house in the future anyway. He went on this whole rant about how he is building their future and don't I dare call him a deadbeat, bc he isn't one.\n\nI don't agree with Mark. My husband and I spend more in a month just the two of us than they budget for their family of 4. I don't think what he is doing is okay and I had to say something... AITA?\n\n---\nEDIT for more info:\n\nI obviously don't know everything about their finances, but what I do know is that maternity leave is 140% of the minimum wage in my country, so double that is 1100\u20ac.\n\nTheir rent was 425\u20ac last year.\n\nEverything below is an estimation:\n\nUtilities: 75-125\u20ac, Food: 350-450\u20ac, Diapers: 100-130\u20ac\n\nIf we give the lower estimates up, it comes up to 950\u20ac a month. What they have left is 150\u20ac to pay for everything TWO babies need other than diapers.

If my dh had told me I couldn't maintain my standard of living, like wearing nails, which I've done for more than 25 years because he wanted to keep all the money he made and made me skimp on what I could buy for the kids, I would divorce him a heartbeat. Raising kids is hard work and women shouldn't have to give up any luxury that brings them joy just because their baby daddy doesn't think they deserve it.

I make more than my bf so I pay more in rent, as it\u2019s equal shared financial pay. Why would I make someone who\u2019s making less, pay the same amount as me? That\u2019s not 50/50 when they are using over half their income to pay it.", "NTA It sounds like Caitlyn is providing financially for the twins, buying the things they need.

Thats a dilemma.\u201d  Non committal mind your own business is the best route.", "Money issues cause so many divorces it\u2019s not even funny. 50/50 isn\u2019t always fair unless both people make almost the exact amount of money. If keeping finances separate or with a combination, like a joint account for joint expenses but otherwise separate accounts, it\u2019s much more fair to go with percentage of income. If I make $100 and my partner makes $50 and our joint expenses are $45, we should each contribute 30% of our income to the joint account\u2026I would be contributing $30 and he would be contributing $15. The dollar amount is not equal but the percentage of income is. As joint expenses increase, such as when having babies, then the joint account needs to be reevaluated. If at the same time one partner\u2019s income has decreased, perhaps due to maternity leave (ps, so envious you live in a country with paid maternity), then they would likely be contributing a lower dollar amount, even if the percentage of income contributed to joint expenses went up. So no, you\u2019re NTA for being mad at your friend. He and his wife just need to have some hard conversations about money and could maybe benefit from the help of a financial planner.", "YTA.

However he cannot be a deadbeat since the kids are fed, the bills are our, and they have a roof over their heads. A deadbeat would be someone who doesn\u2019t provide anything.
