He said he is afraid that she will start treating him like an ATM, but he won't let her.\n\nWhen I pressed on the issue more, Mark told me that they had been doing everything 50-50 financially, because that's fair, but Caitlyn now demands more, claiming the babies' stuff cost more.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. So Caitlyn is taking care of 4 months old twins alone all day and Mark is only contributing financially the same amount as Caitlyn's maternity pay, despite making over 6 times as much.\n\nI told Mark that this is not okay and he is borderline acting like a deadbeat. Mark didn't take it well, he started fighting with me, saying that that amount of money is well enough for their family and he will end up using the money he saved up on buying a house in the future anyway. He went on this whole rant about how he is building their future and don't I dare call him a deadbeat, bc he isn't one.\n\nI don't agree with Mark. My husband and I spend more in a month just the two of us than they budget for their family of 4. I don't think what he is doing is okay and I had to say something...

Raising kids is hard work and women shouldn't have to give up any luxury that brings them joy just because their baby daddy doesn't think they deserve it.

If keeping finances separate or with a combination, like a joint account for joint expenses but otherwise separate accounts, it\u2019s much more fair to go with percentage of income. If I make $100 and my partner makes $50 and our joint expenses are $45, we should each contribute 30% of our income to the joint account\u2026I would be contributing $30 and he would be contributing $15. The dollar amount is not equal but the percentage of income is. As joint expenses increase, such as when having babies, then the joint account needs to be reevaluated. If at the same time one partner\u2019s income has decreased, perhaps due to maternity leave (ps, so envious you live in a country with paid maternity), then they would likely be contributing a lower dollar amount, even if the percentage of income contributed to joint expenses went up.

His leave was unpaid.\n\nAt no time did I think \u201cDamn, he should have to dip into his personal savings to take care of our baby\u2019s basic needs or else he will just be taking advantage of me!\u201d We paid baby expenses out of our joint savings. Once he went back to work we both adjusted the amount of money we contributed to joint expenses because the baby is both of our responsibilities. \n\nOne thing that surprised me is how many people asked if it was \u201cworth it\u201d for me to go back to work with daycare costs. My husband earns 1/3 of my salary. If anyone would quit their job it would be him because his career wouldn\u2019t suffer from a prolonged absence and he makes less overall. Literally not one person asked if my husband would decide to stay at home with the baby even though they have a general grasp on our careers/income difference. Even then my coworkers (STEM field) have assumed that I am solely responsible for paying for daycare because they make their wives fully shoulder that burden. It\u2019s just some weird societal bullshit.", "He overvalues himself and sees them as status symbols maybe? Clearly likes to think of himself as too powerful to be a loser.", "I have trouble understanding couples that keep everything separate that. We pay all we earn into one account. We use that to pay bills, and then portion some out weekly into individual spending accounts for gas/groceries/etc. We also put money into a fun account for each of us to save up for something frivolous or whatever.  The amount in the weekly spending accts has varied over the years. I got more when I did the shopping.  Husband get more now as he does 90% of the grocery shopping since he works there. I have nevwr had to beg my husband for money for something that was a need. He doesn't throw it in my face that I make less, because he knows that my making less contributes in other ways (kids are in my school, always have same days off, free after care, discount on tuition, etc.)\nNTA", "Wow, you sound like an awesome wife and mom. Hopefully your husband realizes this and steps up to significantly increase his income and properly take care of your family.", "Then complain forever about how unfair it is that the courts favor women, leaving out that they do so in situations such as this.", "This is actually basically the same yours/mine/ours system we use. Every check we get an equal amount of \u201cfun\u201d money into our personal accounts and everything else goes to the joint. It\u2019s just easier for us to have it split when the check is issued than to move it after the fact because we used different banks since before marriage. I try to ensure our personal money is roughly equal because I don\u2019t feel like I am entitled to a ton more even though my salary is bigger. It\u2019s just shitty. We are a team. If I get $100 for my  stupid stuff he should also get $100 for his stupid stuff because we are a team. \n\nEverything that can be considered a household/general life expense comes from our joint pot of money. So diapers/house expenses/daycare/vet visits/etc all come from our main account. Completely frivolous shit like my Botox or his Magic cards comes from our personal accounts. No one ever has to ask for money or justify why something is important. I\u2019ve watched friends have to beg their spouses for money to pay for child related expenses and it has always made my blood boil. Buying a child new clothes because they outgrew the old isn\u2019t a luxury that I\u2019m enjoying. It\u2019s just a fact of having a child. \n\nIt\u2019s always baffling to me how many people think that family expenses shouldn\u2019t be shared equally.", "Oh OK, so what are the babies needing that is 150 in an economy where rent is 450?", "NTA. It is reasonable to go ahead and call him a deadbeat to help him understand that he needs to change his attitude and step up. If he doesn\u2019t change his attitude and behavior then there is a reasonable probability that he will truly end up as a deadbeat dad in the future.", "NTA.  Mark is an absolute AH and is being abusive to his wife.  I can not believe he feels he should contribute less money now that they have twins because his partner only has maternity leave income.  What an absolute disgrace.", "NTA- thanks for from all women for calling out that behaviour", "NTA if he wants to do 50/50 he can be fully responsible for 1 of the twins at all times. Figure that out.. Mark.", "NTA.", "In NY, US Mark would pay 19% of his net pay for those children.  He\u2019s getting off easy.  \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Deadbeat might be the wrong word though - financial abuser is right. Or just \u201cbad husband.\u201d\n\nBut the negative sentiment is right.", "Ew. Usually I\u2019d say to keep the judgment to yourself but NTA b/c his resentment of the twins\u2019 and his wife\u2019s needs are \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\nPoor Caitlyn", "NTA this doesn\u2019t sound like 5050 . Because you\u2019re not taking childcare into consideration. Is Mike even doing anything with children is he taking care of them during the night. And he expects his wife to take care of the children full-time and pay 50% of the household with her maternity leave . He sounds like a dead beat to me. and I feel sorry for Kathy for being taken advantage of like this.", "Wow, \n1) he doesn't see how much work his wife is doing 24/7, and of course doesn't see its importance \n\n2) he doesn't value his wife, nor respects her\n\n3) he still see his income as *his* only, not as part of the household \n\n4) idk about \"deadbeat\" but definitely in the road of financially abusive", "NTA. I would have asked him how much he thought she\u2019d get from alimony and child support.", "NTA. Has she sent him a bill for renting out her uterus and undergoing childbirth? Let alone \u2018childcare\u2019.", "The husband is also discounting how maternity leave (and having to take care of the kids cause clearly he won't) will and can potentially delay career opportunities and such when his wife returns to work. next thing you know, husband is going to be upset that his wife getting promoted enough and etc.", "Also, I wonder what he values his body at cause twins likely wrecked hers for a while. I feel so bad for Caitlyn in this scenario", "NTA. Mark however is an enormous AH.", "If he matches her maternity pay, it sounds like they don\u2019t split expenses, but that he only contributes up to what she can despite making 6x as much. With two new kids, more money is going to be needed and it\u2019s definitely going to be harder for her to come up with the money or to save if all her money has to go to the household while his does not.", "Nah. My husband is great and honestly I just feel like I\u2019m doing the bare minimum of being an equal partner. It just so happened that we each were suited for careers with different earning potential (I\u2019m an engineer and he is a nurse) so we each just play to our strengths. He uses the extra days he gets off from his 3/12 schedule to manage running the house/pets/appointments and I get to focus on my career during work hours and the family when I\u2019m home. I feel like we manage as close to 50/50 as possible.", "NTA I don't know if deadbeat was the right word, it sounds more like financial abuse.  His wife physically can't work right now and her income has decreased, because she gave birth to and is caring for their children.  If he didn't think having two babies and one parent going onto benefit pay instead of regular work wasn't going to cost more, then he's dumb as a post.", "Yeah that's weird of him. Other typical expenses are one thing to split, but the kids?? On top of her having to go through not only being the pregnant person and birth, but to take lower earnings on leave, which is barely respect as a reasonable right in this country to begin with, now her husband is technically punishing her for going through all that so they could start a family.\n\nI don't know about deadbeat, but he's at least acting like they are a couple new appliances instead if his children.", "NTA\n\nHis statement that she's using him as an ATM bothers me. So in retrospect, he's using her as an incubator, baby nurse, nanny & many more.", "ESH, stay in your one lane. Disagreements about financial split is hardly the same thing as a deadbeat dad.", "NTA", "Yup Nta and he is a deadbeat calculating A H", "The numbers aren\u2019t like that for me and from the looks of it OPs friend might be making more than me but since having a kid with my gf I went from using maybe $200-300 for myself from my checks to about $100-150 and all my extra goes to my gf for our son so hearing how the friend is moving and acting he\u2019s bugging too hard. \n\nDefinitely NTA op", "NTA at all and in many places this is legally financial abuse as well.", "NTA he\u2019s not a deadbeat though, he\u2019s being financially abusive which is so much worse.", "Sounds like he wanted a girlfriend instead of a wife/partner. NTA.", "NTA. Also\n\n>saying that that amount of money is well enough for their family and he will end up using the money he saved up on buying a house in the future anyway\n\nI lol'd. Buying a house is either you have the money or you don't. If you have then good for you. If you don't then get a mortgage. You don't save money to buy a house. The housing market will leave your saving in the dust unless you can save a ton of money every month. And if that was the case for dear ol' Mark, he should have the money to contribute more for his family.", "He sounds like a mean bastard, but how is it your business?", "There is so much weird shit happening in this exchange.\n\nWhy is he sharing this information with you about how he manages his finances?\n\nWhy do you care?\n\nWhy does he care that you think he is a deadbeat?\n\nIt seems this is what he and his partner have agreed works for them.  If it doesn't work they should probably figure it out between themselves.\n\nWhy are you so deep in their shit?", "Surrogates make like 60k, plus medical expenses. Daycare for 2 kids starts at 2k a month. He owes her a ton of money", "Permanently! Stretch marks, stomach flap that never goes back all the way, saggy boobs that will never naturally regain their perk, not to mention all of the physical effects, so many women with kids end up with bladder issues, uterus issues, you lose a ton of minerals in your body, babies are essentially leaches on your body. I just had post-partum HELLP syndrome (essentially pre-eclampsia) which may have permanently affected my liver, heart, and lungs.", "Also not bad, but he's clearly not earning a whole bread to share with his family....\nMaybe we could settle on slice-whiner?\nSurprised the babies aren't required to chip in.", "Yikes! Yeah, clothing your child is a necessity and should be shared by both parents. That's messed up", "\u201cHis\u201d money. \n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid she will start treating him like an ATM\u201d\n\nMake friends with Caitlyn. She\u2019s going to need support when she leaves him. \n\nNAH.", "NTA He commented to you and you gave your opinion - which was right.", "Sheesh!! Has the guy never been told marriage is a partnership?!  NTA", "People like your friend really grinds my gears, they want 50/50 yet they don't take into consideration that when you have a family things will never be 50/50.  They both chose to have children and yet it his wife who has to scarafice everything, from her pay to her body, time and labour.\n\nIf he wants 50/50 and he isn't prepared to take a hit to do 50% of the childcare, then he should be covering the extras costs.  Add to that to make things completely fair he should of been paying her all the time she was pregnant & gave birth since he couldn't of taken 50% of any of that either.\n\nNTA", "This is why I think at the latest of kids it should never be his money and her money as it causes a lot of troubles \n\nAnd if he is only putting to help pay the basics then he sounds more like a flat mate than a partner and he totally is borderline deadbeat  NTA", "NTA. He sounds awful. No worries-he\u2019ll be divorced soon-no doubt.\nSAHM is a full time job in itself -she is contributing.\nCringe.", "\"his\" money. They're also \"his\" kids. What an arsehole.", "Congrats on having the balls to say what everyone else wants to say to Mark. He is the biggest AHs of Reddit that I have read about tonight, maybe even one of the top ten.", "He's worse than a deadbeat. He's financially abusive.", "Not all are like that. I am a SAHM till summer and we have our own bank accounts. If I need money he only asks: \"How much\", e.g. how much he has to send to my account. I can also use his PayPal account. And I am responsible for having a little cash at home because his bank has fewer branches and going to another ATM is quite costly.  Works for us.", ".....does he even like his wife?", "Don't forget the wages/salaries for a personal cook/housekeeper/chauffeur (if she drives)/personal assistant taking care of all the medical appointments, errands etc.\n\nBeing a SAHM is the equivalent of doing multiple jobs at once but not getting a single penny for all the jobs they do.\n\nPlus OP friend needs to realise that they don't have a single baby which is expensive enough, but TWINS as in 2 babies, so that's literally double the cost of a single baby, and babies go through so much in a shorter amount of time, especially formula, nappies, clothes etc.", "He does seem a couple of slices short of a loaf all round."]}
