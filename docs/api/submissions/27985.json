He kept saying he wants to wait until he\u2019s financially stable. But we already live together and have 3 kids. \n2 years ago, my bf\u2019s older brother (40) started dating someone seriously (29). \nI was feeling annoyed because the entire family immediately loved her since she is the new girl. \n\nSeveral months ago, he announced at a family event that he planned to propose. \n\nEveryone congratulated him and i could see everyone looking at me with pity. \n\nThis girl was getting a ring at 2 years and I haven\u2019t gotten anything. And because she is new to the family with no beef, they all love her unconditionally.\n\nAround June they announced their engagement and they announced she was also expecting. \n\nTheir entire family was constantly talking about them and celebrating them and she was receiving all kinds of special treatment from everyone. \nTheir dad even offered to financially help them with a wedding. \n\nLong story short, I found out I was also expecting in July right after they became engaged. \n\nI told my bf i wanted a ring immediately and after A long talk he promised to get me one. \n\nOver the last 2 weeks we have been telling family members about our good news but they didn\u2019t seem happy for us at all. They were weird and looked concerned and shocked. \n\nAnd then yesterday, his sister accused me of trying to steal the thunder and spotlight away from the brother and his fianc\u00e9e. She thinks I intentionally planned everything on purpose. \n\nI didn\u2019t plan it but who cares? I think it\u2019s fair that I have a wedding before the new girl because I been with him longer. If anyone needs financial help with events and wedding and rings, it\u2019s us. \n\nSo AITA for asking to get married before my SIL?\n\nEdit: this is nothing against the fianc\u00e9e. And, most of the family is not aware we are discussing rings and marriage right now so I haven\u2019t technically stolen her thunder at this time. \nI was accused of stealing thunder because we announced our son a week before their baby shower for their son. \n\n*throwaway account*", "created_utc": 1696124464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16woacl/aita_for_asking_to_get_married_before_my_sil_does/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you want to marry someone who you have to manipulate into proposing? \n\nI think you saw your relationship in sharp contrast to his brother\u2019s and are desperately trying to show everyone, including yourself, that yours is just as strong as theirs. The problem, of course, is that it isn\u2019t. His family knows that, which is why they look at you with pity. \n\nThe time to seriously discuss marriage was about a decade ago.

At this point, what's the purpose of getting married?", "YTA\n\nYou can't change that your boyfriend's family has welcomed his brother's fianc\u00e9e in a warmer manner than they did with you. As you said, you have a history with them that isn't the greatest, while she's coming in on a fresh slate. Of course, your situations are different. Feeling bitter and jealous about it will ensure that distance never shortens or fades. It's also not fair to you or to the fianc\u00e9e for you to become competitive about something like this. It also jeopardizes any potential relationship you could have with the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nI know it sucks to feel like you're not accepted, but there are healthier ways to cope with that. You said you're trying to do better. This can set you back or be an opportunity for you to show that you're trying to do better.\n\nFrom your post, it doesn't line up that \"I told my bf i wanted a ring immediately and after A long talk he promised to get me one\" and then \"I noticed it took his brother getting engaged and us expecting again for my bf to talk about it. I wanted to jump on it before he changed his mind\".\n\nYou can do whatever you want. It's your relationship, and of course, you should announce your pregnancy even if they just did. However, it sounds like you're using a special situation that will never happen again for your BIL and his fianc\u00e9e to leverage your own situation, in which you've had plenty of time to take this stand and will obviously have plenty more to do so, but are still choosing to do this *now*.", "YTA.

From your post it's clear that you pushed for the ring in it self. Also if you have been with the family for so long then why do you want to be treated like the new gal?", "Yta.

You already have a family together, being married is just signing a piece of paper and being tied legally. You\u2019re just jealous of his brother and future SIL. Forcing him to get married will not end well for you - being forced to do something only causes resentment. He might just leave you if you keep pushing. Either he wants to marry you, or he doesn\u2019t because he\u2019s fine with his life as it currently is. You, in turn, will need to learn to either be happy with your life as is, or just learn to wait until he finally proposes.\n\nEdit: you might want to discuss things with your BF because he obviously has reservations about marriage for whatever reason. If your relationship isn\u2019t perfect, getting married won\u2019t fix anything (neither will having kids). Maybe communicate with him on this instead of making demands? \n\nAlso, why do continue to have more kids if you can\u2019t afford to support the kids you already have comfortably?  You say you\u2019re not financially stable and need financial assistance, yet you try to downplay that fact by saying money will be tight but you can afford another kid? No, you can\u2019t afford another kid if it\u2019s going cause even more financial problems.

But we already live together and have 3 kids. \n2 years ago, my bf\u2019s older brother (40) started dating someone seriously (29). \nI was feeling annoyed because the entire family immediately loved her since she is the new girl. \n\nSeveral months ago, he announced at a family event that he planned to propose. \n\nEveryone congratulated him and i could see everyone looking at me with pity. \n\nThis girl was getting a ring at 2 years and I haven\u2019t gotten anything. And because she is new to the family with no beef, they all love her unconditionally.\n\nAround June they announced their engagement and they announced she was also expecting. \n\nTheir entire family was constantly talking about them and celebrating them and she was receiving all kinds of special treatment from everyone. \nTheir dad even offered to financially help them with a wedding. \n\nLong story short, I found out I was also expecting in July right after they became engaged. \n\nI told my bf i wanted a ring immediately and after A long talk he promised to get me one. \n\nOver the last 2 weeks we have been telling family members about our good news but they didn\u2019t seem happy for us at all. They were weird and looked concerned and shocked. \n\nAnd then yesterday, his sister accused me of trying to steal the thunder and spotlight away from the brother and his fianc\u00e9e. She thinks I intentionally planned everything on purpose. \n\nI didn\u2019t but who cares? I think it\u2019s fair that I have a wedding before the new girl because I been with him longer and his family. I have worked harder and my bf agrees with me. If anyone needs financial help with events and wedding and rings, it\u2019s us. \n\nSo AITA for asking to get married before my SIL?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I'm sorry hun. I'm not going to say if you're the AH or not but STOP HAVING HIS CHILDREN! He has almost no reason to marry you other than the fact that you keep bringing it up. Be very careful and make sure that this isn't a \"shut up\" ring and not a real engagement. Because it doesn't feel like he wants to marry you. I'm sorry.", "[removed]", "Yta", "YTA. \n\nGetting married isn't a competition. Are you wanting a big wedding? Is that why your partner wants to be more financially stable? \n\nIf all you want is to just get married so you can share a last name with your partner and children and you feel like you need that legal commitment, then you guys can elope whenever you want. \n\nBut I feel like there's more to the story here and you do not need to get married before your BIL and his fiance just because you've been around longer.", "Dawn whag", "Think about what you just wrote, 13 years together 3 kids and he hasn\u2019t asked you to marry him!! WAKE UP HE WILL NEVER MARRY YOU! Why should he, he has a live in maid!", "YTA\n\nYou come out to be jealous, immature. It also seems as if you deliberately planned for the 4th baby. \nWhy would you, knowing you have financial issues and also that you are not getting married because you are financially stable even go for another child?\nIt all just seems like a competition to get ahead of the new girl and to prove to all that you are both so good together. Which definitely isn't the case.", "YTA you are old news darling. You should have given the ultimatum many years ago.", "YTA. Those poor kids.", "YTA. Was kinda on board until the \u201cif anyone needs financial help with events and wedding and rings, it\u2019s us\u201d part.", "I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re even asking. You said you asked to get married before SIL in your title, but you say in your post you haven\u2019t even told the family you are planning to get married? You\u2019re NTA for feeling the way you feel, but YWBTA if you acted on this in any way and told people you wanted to get married first, or acted negatively toward the SIL because of your jealousy. Be honest with yourself, it\u2019s clearly jealousy and SIL has done nothing to deserve it. Your negative feelings should be toward your bf if anyone for waiting this long and not wanting to marry you sooner.", "YTA the timing makes you look like an AH. I can sense why they don\u2019t like you as much. They certainly won\u2019t be thrilled with you if you say out loud how you deserve to get married first.", "YTA\n\nPlease get some therapy. What\u2019s wrong with you?", "Hmmm I wonder why they don\u2019t like you? You seem like a peach\u2026\u2026. YTA you\u2019ve got a lot of growing up to do. Why can\u2019t you just be happy for your bil? Why did you have to turn this into a competition? Are you always so narcissistic?", "Oh my God who the hell cares?", "Yta. Who is paying for the wedding? Because his parents are contributing to theirs do you now expect them to foot the bill for your wedding? You may be 35 but you\u2019re still acting like a jealous high school girl. You\u2019re also acting entitled af if anyone needs help with events weddings, and rings, it\u2019s us\u2026\u2026.how about this pay for it yourself. Buy what you can afford. If you can only afford cheap buy cheap. Rings weddings and events are supposed to be about the love between the couple and nothing else. I couldn\u2019t afford a big wedding so I spent under 3k eloping and spent 10k on my honeymoon. My brother and his wife spent 100k on their wedding no honeymoon. Do what you can afford and don\u2019t expect anyone else to foot the bill. You won\u2019t be the asshole if you have your wedding first though. You\u2019re being the asshole because of your entitled behavior.", "YTA you sound jealous and petty, why are you now in a rush to get married? You guys had 13 years and it didn't happen, but now you want to be married before the new girl because you've been together with your boyfriend longer , it's not a contest. \n\nIn my family my lil sister got married first, eventhough my brother has been together with his girlfriend much longer, think they are nearing 17 years and my lil sister was barely 2 years together when they got married. And there's a realistic chance that I might marry before my brother does and that's okay, people make different choices and different things that are important.", "Sounds more like they don\u2019t see it as good news if you have been pushing for it and he doesn\u2019t want to. They are likely over the drama and don\u2019t really care and want your bil to have his moment without the drama they are used to from the both of you.", "YTA. you told youe bf that you were pregnant and wanted a ring. You know how that would make him feel yeah? If it was just about getting married you wouldnt have a pressing need to do it before your soon to be sister in law", "YTA, this is hilarious. Your bf doesn\u2019t want to marry you, you should have worked that out long ago. Now you are jealous because his brother loves his gf and wants to marry her.", "This just has to be fake.", "All this stealing thunder shit is childish. You got pregnant so you told family,  just happens she us pregnant too. No one has a monopoly on who gets married first. I understand  why you feel put out at the families reaction,  especially if they never seemed to like you, that's hard", "I\u2019m not gonna say ur YTA but my heart kinda hurts for u he doesn\u2019t seem like he loves enough to marry u honesty I would have a long look about ur relationship maybe u guys need to have a break or something cuz he does t want to commit to you", "YTA for not realizing that if he hasn't proposed in 13 years, he doesn't truly want to and is fine with how things are.   You're pushing and guilting him into it because you think you \"deserve it first\" isn't a great foundation, nor will it go over well with the family.", "Wait until in a better financial position to get married ( we got married in a registry office for \u20ac200) so his excuse is a cop out. YTA because you are peeved your partner hasn\u2019t proposed even though you are together years, that\u2019s the bare bones of it plain and simple. What it really comes down to it is jealousy. Go to a registry office and get married. Do it privately as because at the end of the day you just want to be married right? Also stop comparing yourself to other people. ( comparison is the thief of joy).", "YTA, the jealousy you have is leaping out of the app", "YTA what does his family resent you for? Is it dramatic bullshit like what you\u2019re currently pulling? You\u2019re claiming the \u201cups and downs\u201d are because you started dating \u201cso young\u201d but you were in your 20\u2019s, not middle school, and there seems to be a lot of information you\u2019re omitting. No matter the case, your boyfriend clearly does not want to marry you. His brother has nothing to do with it.", "YTA and an insecure one at that. This woman and her relationship have NOTHING to do with you. You seem to be in a bad relationship and are extraordinarily jealous. Please get therapy, both individual and couple", "I think OP is deflecting, that\u2019s why she\u2019s a bit pissed at the sil and family. Honestly, wanting to get married before them is a you and your husband problem. What I think you\u2019re subconsciously doing is trying to set it right in your mind. Because you\u2019ve seen bil & this women and how the family is with her how you feel it should\u2019ve been with you. Bil is proof that if he wanted to he would. You\u2019ve been with your man over a decade and have 3 kids and 1otw\u2026\u2026 honey I\u2019m sorry to tell you but that man doesn\u2019t want to get married to you. Why are you trying to hold on to someone so tightly who doesn\u2019t want you like that. I think if you want to be happy , you need to be ok with how the relationship is. If you aren\u2019t, then that\u2019s not the relationship for you. Like do you love him or do you love loving someone?", "Your SIL is not your problem. Your partner is. I understand that seeing how fast things progressed with her made it even more painfully clear to you that your relationship sucks. But it's not this woman's fault, nor your partner's family fault. Your relationship is between you and your partner. It seems he doesn't want to marry you, which sucks, because you have been together for so long and have 3 kids and another one on the way. I understand your pain and frustration, but you are directing your negative feelings towards the wrong person and starting this competition with your SIL in your head. Also, you are the one that consented to be in the situation you are now. YTA.", "YTA.\n\n13 years together, 3 kids and one more coming\u2026a bit late for a wedding don\u2019t you think!", "Sounds a LOT like they keep having kids to \u201csave\u201d their relationship. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want to be with her and is only still in it for the kids. Whatever \u201cbeef\u201d OP has with the family is probably warranted and the \u201cpity\u201d she saw was probably fear that OP was going to blow up at the new fianc\u00e9e for getting married first.", "Nailed it in one. I couldn't have said it any better.", "It's pretty obvious that the family doesn't like a relationship with three kids already and no marriage, probably no financial stability, either. I'd be upset if these were my children acting like this, too.\n\nI'd like to explain to OP that weddings aren't competitions, but I think she needs to tackle bigger problems, like getting a grip on her entire life.", "We will be a little tight but we can afford another child. \n\nIt just was not part of our plan. The entire family is aware how hard I\u2019ve pushed for us to get married. \nSo for us to still not be married and have another child (unplanned) shocked all of them. I think they would rather have us announced an engagement than another child tbh.", "Not to mention a FOURTH kid yikes.\n\nFocus on taking care of so many children and just have a justice of the peace ceremony if you need a marriage", "It doesn't sound like he's particularly enthusiastic is an .... understatement. I do not suspect this proposal would have happened without over a decade of pressure.", "Seriously, wish them well. You need to get your life in order. You have a 4th child on the way. How will you support your children. Where are you career wise. Sorry to say you cannot depend on your bf. Depend on yourself and follow what makes you happy. If things are not working out, negotiate coparenting. You don't sound like you are happy in the relationship or with his family. If it is dragging you down, leave.", "This is not a proposal, that sounds like a damned hostage situation. Then again he's not blameless for continuing to pop out kids with someone he clearly doesn't want to marry. Just all around this relationship sounds toxic. Best of luck to brother and FSIL though!", "She had 3 kids already, the marathon is running out. She\u2019s on mile 22 beating herself ragged", "Exactly - they've been dating for 2 years, which is a perfectly reasonable timeframe to get engaged. Then again if you've been nagging your baby daddy to propose for 13 years I can see how two would feel like the \"new girl\"", "My dad was actually pretty commitment-phobic with my mom - they dated FOREVER (I think 8 years) before he proposed, but they waited to have kids until after they were married and now have a super happy marriage of over 35 years. It CAN happen.  \n\n\nBut that is the rare thing and in most cases it's not a good start - after 10+ years he's only going to do it as a shut up ring. This does not sound like a case where it will all work out in the end.", "Getting married is actually very important. You have zero rights in a relationship without marriage. Especially with three kids, yikes", "He clearly didn't want to be married. Nobody is owed marriage.", "Are they married or are they roommates with offspring?", "22 is very young. The brain isn\u2019t fully developed until 26", "I agree with most of it - but it's NOT a competition between OP and SIL, because I sincerely doubt that SIL is doing any of this to \"win\" or \"be first\" like OP is. It's only a \"race\" in OP's mind - SIL is just living her best life getting engaged to brother and expecting.   \n\n\nCompetition implies SIL is also being petty and jealous and I don't think it sounds like she is.", "He obviously doesn't want to marry you. You're jealous and petty. His father probably will not help you financially because the whole family doesn't like you. They will not be happy if you get engaged. Probably will try to talk their son out of it.", "But the motivation is purely to be married before her it seems which is absolutely ludicrous. How are you not trying to steal the spotlight with this as your motivation? YTA", "He doesn\u2019t want to marry you. In his mind it\u2019s not any different than now. You say your relationship has ups and downs. That\u2019s a red flag for getting married. It sounds like you are basically begging him to marry you. I think it sounds like he is trapped.", "No, you're still very dysfunctional now.", "He obviously doesn\u2019t want to marry you. If he wanted to he would\u2019ve. Now you\u2019re forcing him into it - this will end well \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Where is your self respect?! A man who doesn\u2019t want to marry you, who is reluctantly doing so not because of you but because he didn\u2019t get daddy\u2019s attention? And you\u2019re desperate to hold onto this? Even though everyone knows how desperate you are and his family already dislike you?!", "Have yous considered couples counselling?", "The problem is you are defining your own relationship on other people's terms... healthy relationships don't GAF about when their wedding is in relation to other weddings - they get married when it's right for them, and they are happy for their friends and family when friends and family get married at the time that's right for them.  \n\n\n(Your other problem is having more kids when your finances are tight with a man you've been bugging to propose to you for the better part of a decade - he doesn't want to propose to you, for whatever reason, and you NEED to address that rather than force a ring).", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Maybe that could happen if you two stopped popping out kids. YTA. It sounds like you bullied him into it. Also you sound super jealous. You mentioned beef with his family, what past events caused that?", "But you say you need financial help in your post?    \"If anyone needs financial help with events and wedding and rings, it\u2019s us.\"", ">We will be a little tight but we can afford another child. \n\nPlease tell me how when by your own admission you need financial help", "Stop having kids. If he\u2019s worried about finances why on earth are you getting knocked up. Again?!", "It's very hard to have an unplanned pregnancy when using Norplant or an IUD", "Then sorry but YTA. You don\u2019t bully someone into marrying you. Having another baby when you can\u2019t provide for your first 3 is unwise but may be an accident, it\u2019s selfish if it\u2019s planned. But planning a wedding with 4 kids depending on you, with little money and a reluctant groom\u2026 that\u2019s so incredibly selfish.\n\nYou\u2019re jealous of this woman because you think she\u2019s living the life you deserve but the truth is that the only person whose happiness you care about is you. Sorry if this is harsh but everyone wants her wedding, you are the ONLY person who seems to want your\u2019s.", "He wants to be financially stable before he gets married but you keep having kids. Sounds like you need to leave him if he\u2019s going to string you along. If he wants to wait to be financially stable he shouldn\u2019t have had kids with you. Kids are expensive. I have a feeling that if you ever do become financially stable he will just move the goal posts.", "She should have never given him kids without it. At this point he definitely owes her. If not marriage, financial compensation. I\u2019d take the financial compensation because he isn\u2019t husband material.", "In the overall trajectory of life, I would completely agree with you that 22 is very young. But in the context of dating which OP was referring to, it seems like a very typical age to dip your toe in romance, especially in America.", "But not impossible. I have known multiple people who have gotten pregnant while having an IUD in and 2 have had viable pregnancies and the children are happy and healthy. Having an IUD doesn't mean you can't have an unplanned pregnancy.", "Hahahahaha \n\nTell that to my 2 year old.", "This isn\u2019t dating, it\u2019s marriage and raising children which takes emotional maturity to do successfully", "It's not impossible, because short of abstinence, there's a failure rate to all birth control methods. However, it's extremely low for IUDs. It would be even lower if they combined methods, and had an IUD and condoms. \n\nIf they're not financially stable enough to get married, they're really not financially stable enough for a kid. Kids are much more expensive.", "I was on birth control when I got pregnant with both my girls.  They were unplanned but not unwanted.  Lol.  Condoms with the first and the pill with the second.", "Could still happen even if combining IUD and condoms. I know because I know someone that happened to. \n\nSo really, the only real way to prevent pregnancy is abstinence. \n\nMarriage doesn't need to mean an expensive wedding.", "This is true, but IUDs are statistically the most effective means of contraception outside of abstinence. Statistical anomalies can happen but if OP got pregnant FOUR TIMES while using an IUD or implant I will literally eat my hat, and I say this as a former planned parenthood contraceptive educator."]}
