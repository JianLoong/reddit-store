He kept saying he wants to wait until he\u2019s financially stable. But we already live together and have 3 kids. \n2 years ago, my bf\u2019s older brother (40) started dating someone seriously (29). \nI was feeling annoyed because the entire family immediately loved her since she is the new girl. \n\nSeveral months ago, he announced at a family event that he planned to propose. \n\nEveryone congratulated him and i could see everyone looking at me with pity. \n\nThis girl was getting a ring at 2 years and I haven\u2019t gotten anything. And because she is new to the family with no beef, they all love her unconditionally.\n\nAround June they announced their engagement and they announced she was also expecting. \n\nTheir entire family was constantly talking about them and celebrating them and she was receiving all kinds of special treatment from everyone. \nTheir dad even offered to financially help them with a wedding. \n\nLong story short, I found out I was also expecting in July right after they became engaged. \n\nI told my bf i wanted a ring immediately and after A long talk he promised to get me one. \n\nOver the last 2 weeks we have been telling family members about our good news but they didn\u2019t seem happy for us at all. They were weird and looked concerned and shocked. \n\nAnd then yesterday, his sister accused me of trying to steal the thunder and spotlight away from the brother and his fianc\u00e9e. She thinks I intentionally planned everything on purpose. \n\nI didn\u2019t plan it but who cares? I think it\u2019s fair that I have a wedding before the new girl because I been with him longer. If anyone needs financial help with events and wedding and rings, it\u2019s us. \n\nSo AITA for asking to get married before my SIL?\n\nEdit: this is nothing against the fianc\u00e9e. And, most of the family is not aware we are discussing rings and marriage right now so I haven\u2019t technically stolen her thunder at this time. \nI was accused of stealing thunder because we announced our son a week before their baby shower for their son. \n\n*throwaway account*", "created_utc": 1696124464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16woacl/aita_for_asking_to_get_married_before_my_sil_does/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you want to marry someone who you have to manipulate into proposing? \n\nI think you saw your relationship in sharp contrast to his brother\u2019s and are desperately trying to show everyone, including yourself, that yours is just as strong as theirs. The problem, of course, is that it isn\u2019t. His family knows that, which is why they look at you with pity. \n\nThe time to seriously discuss marriage was about a decade ago.

At this point, what's the purpose of getting married?", "YTA\n\nYou can't change that your boyfriend's family has welcomed his brother's fianc\u00e9e in a warmer manner than they did with you. As you said, you have a history with them that isn't the greatest, while she's coming in on a fresh slate. Of course, your situations are different. Feeling bitter and jealous about it will ensure that distance never shortens or fades. It's also not fair to you or to the fianc\u00e9e for you to become competitive about something like this. It also jeopardizes any potential relationship you could have with the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nI know it sucks to feel like you're not accepted, but there are healthier ways to cope with that. You said you're trying to do better. This can set you back or be an opportunity for you to show that you're trying to do better.\n\nFrom your post, it doesn't line up that \"I told my bf i wanted a ring immediately and after A long talk he promised to get me one\" and then \"I noticed it took his brother getting engaged and us expecting again for my bf to talk about it. I wanted to jump on it before he changed his mind\".\n\nYou can do whatever you want. It's your relationship, and of course, you should announce your pregnancy even if they just did. However, it sounds like you're using a special situation that will never happen again for your BIL and his fianc\u00e9e to leverage your own situation, in which you've had plenty of time to take this stand and will obviously have plenty more to do so, but are still choosing to do this *now*.", "YTA.

From your post it's clear that you pushed for the ring in it self. Also if you have been with the family for so long then why do you want to be treated like the new gal?", "Yta.

You already have a family together, being married is just signing a piece of paper and being tied legally. You\u2019re just jealous of his brother and future SIL. Forcing him to get married will not end well for you - being forced to do something only causes resentment. He might just leave you if you keep pushing. Either he wants to marry you, or he doesn\u2019t because he\u2019s fine with his life as it currently is. You, in turn, will need to learn to either be happy with your life as is, or just learn to wait until he finally proposes.\n\nEdit: you might want to discuss things with your BF because he obviously has reservations about marriage for whatever reason. If your relationship isn\u2019t perfect, getting married won\u2019t fix anything (neither will having kids). Maybe communicate with him on this instead of making demands? \n\nAlso, why do continue to have more kids if you can\u2019t afford to support the kids you already have comfortably?  You say you\u2019re not financially stable and need financial assistance, yet you try to downplay that fact by saying money will be tight but you can afford another kid? No, you can\u2019t afford another kid if it\u2019s going cause even more financial problems.

But we already live together and have 3 kids. \n2 years ago, my bf\u2019s older brother (40) started dating someone seriously (29). \nI was feeling annoyed because the entire family immediately loved her since she is the new girl. \n\nSeveral months ago, he announced at a family event that he planned to propose. \n\nEveryone congratulated him and i could see everyone looking at me with pity. \n\nThis girl was getting a ring at 2 years and I haven\u2019t gotten anything. And because she is new to the family with no beef, they all love her unconditionally.\n\nAround June they announced their engagement and they announced she was also expecting. \n\nTheir entire family was constantly talking about them and celebrating them and she was receiving all kinds of special treatment from everyone. \nTheir dad even offered to financially help them with a wedding. \n\nLong story short, I found out I was also expecting in July right after they became engaged. \n\nI told my bf i wanted a ring immediately and after A long talk he promised to get me one. \n\nOver the last 2 weeks we have been telling family members about our good news but they didn\u2019t seem happy for us at all. They were weird and looked concerned and shocked. \n\nAnd then yesterday, his sister accused me of trying to steal the thunder and spotlight away from the brother and his fianc\u00e9e. She thinks I intentionally planned everything on purpose. \n\nI didn\u2019t but who cares? I think it\u2019s fair that I have a wedding before the new girl because I been with him longer and his family. I have worked harder and my bf agrees with me. If anyone needs financial help with events and wedding and rings, it\u2019s us. \n\nSo AITA for asking to get married before my SIL?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I'm sorry hun. I'm not going to say if you're the AH or not but STOP HAVING HIS CHILDREN! He has almost no reason to marry you other than the fact that you keep bringing it up.

I'm sorry.", "[removed]", "Yta", "YTA. \n\nGetting married isn't a competition. Are you wanting a big wedding?

It also seems as if you deliberately planned for the 4th baby. \nWhy would you, knowing you have financial issues and also that you are not getting married because you are financially stable even go for another child?\nIt all just seems like a competition to get ahead of the new girl and to prove to all that you are both so good together.

You\u2019re NTA for feeling the way you feel, but YWBTA if you acted on this in any way and told people you wanted to get married first, or acted negatively toward the SIL because of your jealousy. Be honest with yourself, it\u2019s clearly jealousy and SIL has done nothing to deserve it. Your negative feelings should be toward your bf if anyone for waiting this long and not wanting to marry you sooner.", "YTA the timing makes you look like an AH.

If you can only afford cheap buy cheap. Rings weddings and events are supposed to be about the love between the couple and nothing else. I couldn\u2019t afford a big wedding so I spent under 3k eloping and spent 10k on my honeymoon. My brother and his wife spent 100k on their wedding no honeymoon.

Now you are jealous because his brother loves his gf and wants to marry her.", "This just has to be fake.", "All this stealing thunder shit is childish.

YTA because you are peeved your partner hasn\u2019t proposed even though you are together years, that\u2019s the bare bones of it plain and simple. What it really comes down to it is jealousy.

Honestly, wanting to get married before them is a you and your husband problem. What I think you\u2019re subconsciously doing is trying to set it right in your mind. Because you\u2019ve seen bil & this women and how the family is with her how you feel it should\u2019ve been with you. Bil is proof that if he wanted to he would. You\u2019ve been with your man over a decade and have 3 kids and 1otw\u2026\u2026 honey I\u2019m sorry to tell you but that man doesn\u2019t want to get married to you.

Your relationship is between you and your partner. It seems he doesn't want to marry you, which sucks, because you have been together for so long and have 3 kids and another one on the way. I understand your pain and frustration, but you are directing your negative feelings towards the wrong person and starting this competition with your SIL in your head.

It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want to be with her and is only still in it for the kids. Whatever \u201cbeef\u201d OP has with the family is probably warranted and the \u201cpity\u201d she saw was probably fear that OP was going to blow up at the new fianc\u00e9e for getting married first.", "Nailed it in one. I couldn't have said it any better.", "It's pretty obvious that the family doesn't like a relationship with three kids already and no marriage, probably no financial stability, either. I'd be upset if these were my children acting like this, too.\n\nI'd like to explain to OP that weddings aren't competitions, but I think she needs to tackle bigger problems, like getting a grip on her entire life.", "We will be a little tight but we can afford another child. \n\nIt just was not part of our plan. The entire family is aware how hard I\u2019ve pushed for us to get married. \nSo for us to still not be married and have another child (unplanned) shocked all of them.

If it is dragging you down, leave.", "This is not a proposal, that sounds like a damned hostage situation.

She\u2019s on mile 22 beating herself ragged", "Exactly - they've been dating for 2 years, which is a perfectly reasonable timeframe to get engaged.

It CAN happen.  \n\n\nBut that is the rare thing and in most cases it's not a good start - after 10+ years he's only going to do it as a shut up ring.

How are you not trying to steal the spotlight with this as your motivation? YTA", "He doesn\u2019t want to marry you. In his mind it\u2019s not any different than now.

Sounds like you need to leave him if he\u2019s going to string you along. If he wants to wait to be financially stable he shouldn\u2019t have had kids with you. Kids are expensive. I have a feeling that if you ever do become financially stable he will just move the goal posts.", "She should have never given him kids without it. At this point he definitely owes her.

Having an IUD doesn't mean you can't have an unplanned pregnancy.", "Hahahahaha \n\nTell that to my 2 year old.", "This isn\u2019t dating, it\u2019s marriage and raising children which takes emotional maturity to do successfully", "It's not impossible, because short of abstinence, there's a failure rate to all birth control methods. However, it's extremely low for IUDs. It would be even lower if they combined methods, and had an IUD and condoms. \n\nIf they're not financially stable enough to get married, they're really not financially stable enough for a kid. Kids are much more expensive.", "I was on birth control when I got pregnant with both my girls.  They were unplanned but not unwanted.  Lol.  Condoms with the first and the pill with the second.", "Could still happen even if combining IUD and condoms. I know because I know someone that happened to. \n\nSo really, the only real way to prevent pregnancy is abstinence. \n\nMarriage doesn't need to mean an expensive wedding.", "This is true, but IUDs are statistically the most effective means of contraception outside of abstinence. Statistical anomalies can happen but if OP got pregnant FOUR TIMES while using an IUD or implant I will literally eat my hat, and I say this as a former planned parenthood contraceptive educator.", "This is a bigger issue than Reddit can help with. You sound jealous in your post, I\u2019d be stunned if some of your feelings didn\u2019t carry over into real life and it might be more visible to your family than you realise. I think you are hurt and confused and struggling with the fact that, despite 3 children and another on the way, you aren\u2019t married. Plenty of people live together and have families without being legally hitched but it sounds as if being married is a goal of yours. Problem is, your partner doesn\u2019t seem in any rush and with a new baby coming you are about to be even busier- not the best time to organise a wedding. \n\n\nYour SIL who accused you shouldn\u2019t have done so- you let the family know you were expecting shortly before the baby shower for your newest SIL. That\u2019s not stealing her thunder, you didn\u2019t do it at the event, you didn\u2019t hide it poorly then have it come out at the shower because you\u2019re feeling sick and avoiding alcohol, you didn\u2019t plan this pregnancy to steal her thunder and SIL1 needs to stay in her lane. \n\n\nThis whole thing is nothing to do with your new SIL, it\u2019s about your relationship with your partner and also with his family. Something is very rocky here and honestly? Instead of putting money into a wedding or a ring, I\u2019d propose couples therapy and working out what you both really want from this relationship and what you can commit to. You\u2019ve got 3, soon to be 4, children and a home together, you\u2019ve been together for 13 years, that\u2019s commitment even if it doesn\u2019t come with a ring and an expensive party. You have more important issues which need to be worked through before you can talk about planning a wedding. \n\n\nTry to be nicer and more accepting of your new SIl. She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and is not responsible for your in laws behaviour. Go to her shower, give her a gift and just celebrate with her. Don\u2019t give any thought to continuing any beef with SIL1, be classy and be nice and refuse to get drawn in to drama. Show your in laws that you aren\u2019t being a jealous grump, that you aren\u2019t stealing her thunder and concentrate on your own relationship. \n\n\nCongratulations on your new baby.

You\u2019re not only trying to get married before your partner\u2019s brother but you **forced** him to propose **after** getting knocked up for the **fourth** time. \n\nI honestly feel really bad for the woman getting married to your boyfriend\u2019s brother. She has no idea how you\u2019ll probably keep trying to one up her. You hate the fact that everyone loves her, that she actually gets along with everyone, and that she didn\u2019t have to push her partner to propose to her.", "YTA. You\u2019re an incredibly jealous person.

His family doesn't like you. They aren't obligated to celebrate you. It barely sounds like your partner likes you, tbh. You already have 3 kids. There's bad blood between you and his family and since you didnt give context you're probably the one who fucked up big time. \n\nCan you afford a fourth child  if you aren't financially stable according to your partner? I'd be concerned too.\n\nYou want all the things that are given to the new fiance freely, because they want to and like her, but without understanding that thats the only way they can be given. You want to try to force it and up stage her. I'm pretty sure someone's wedding will be low turnout in that situation. But it won't be hers.", "YTA. You\u2019re projecting a lot onto the family and the fianc\u00e9 when in reality your issue is your partner. You clearly want different things, and yeah he\u2019s a bit of an AH for stringing you along with an \u2018eventual marriage\u2019, but you\u2019re an AH for bullying him into it and timing everything so poorly that you\u2019re ruining someone else\u2019s happy moments. \n\nWhat were the \u2018up and down\u2019 moments that caused his family to dislike you?", "Lol. Yes you ATA \n\nI also think a person who is pissy about someone else getting married before her\u2026 there\u2019s probably solid reasons this family has to not like you", "YTA this other woman has nothing to do with you. You\u2019re not in competition with her. Worry about your own relationship.", "Think you're more than an A, you're vindictive \n\nWhy do you keep having kids with someone who doesn't want to marry you?", "So your solution to being deeply unhappy that your boyfriend   does not want to marry you despite having fathered 3 children with you is...to get pregnant by him again?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nLife is not a contest and your SIL and you aren't competing. Stop being jealous and focus on you and your life. The fact that you are unsatisfied by your relationship and the lack of enthusiasm of your bf and his family is NOT your SILs fault. \n\nSeriously, just stop it.", "I\u2019m not going to say YTA because honestly, your life seems so sad. You are with a man who clearly has no intentions of being better for you. I don\u2019t know if he loves you or not but you\u2019ve been married for 13 long years and have a large family already and he hasn\u2019t ever proposed, when you have voiced that you do want to marry him. Seems to everyone except to you that he doesn\u2019t actually want to marry you. On the other hand, you said you\u2019re not financially stable and got knocked up a fourth time?! You know condoms? Vasectomies? Guess not. How can his family be happy for you? And it actually seems like you want to be first this time because you\u2019re always left for later.

Why do you seem to NEED it so badly. Generally speaking, I've never understood the whole fuss about weddings, but that's for me. I think having a home and kids is so much significant than a big display of money wasting. Yes, it can be nice and all, and I've been to several wonderful weddings, but why making it a major couple goal with such a huge social pressure? This part tickles me a little, as you can read.\n\nTo me, OP looks like a spoiled brat. \"I want my ring\", \"I want my fancy wedding\", \"I want it before your brother does\". Wow. Calm down, Dudley. You have 3 kids a soon another one to take care of. Isn't that enough for now?\n\nGeez.", "Please stop calling a pregnant 29-year-old a \u201cgirl\u201d. She\u2019s not a child in any way just because she\u2019s a few years your junior. She\u2019s a woman. I can see how minuscule this seems, but it speaks volumes when a woman refers to a fellow woman as \u201cthis girl\u201d. For reference, I\u2019m a woman and older than both of you. Sometimes it\u2019s a slip of the tongue, but your continued use is infantilizing this adult human. It\u2019s normal to want things that others have and we don\u2019t- it\u2019s not healthy or fair to project these inadequacies onto others. Furthermore, you\u2019re mad at your partner, not your SIL. It\u2019s not her responsibility in any way to attend to your relationship- it\u2019s your partner\u2019s. \nPlease don\u2019t ruin either of your pregnancies or nuptials by having to be first.

The family has two options, to go or not to go (that is the question!) \n\nThe first thing you need to do is have a conversation with your fiance. The two of you need to figure out where you stand on his family.

Is it going to change anything in your relationship? Or is there a jealousy factor going on here? Instead of spending the money to get married, you guys did the thing that actually matters. You started and built your life and your family together. A ring and an expensive party aren't going to do that for you. It's not going to make it any easier, better, or more \"real.\" \n\nTo me, having the wedding after you have built your life together, maybe even been through some hell, is a lot more meaningful. I may be biased. I have been with my husband (yes, he's my husband and I'm his wife) for 17 (almost) years. We never had a wedding, we never had a ceremony, we never went to the courthouse, we have not signed a piece of paper. I do not have a ring. It never mattered to us. It was far more important to build our relationship and our life together.\n\nOver the last few years, we have gone through absolute hell. Our relationship took a nosedive, shot straight through Rock bottom and wedged itself into the deepest, most toxic depth of toxicity. Somehow, we managed to come back together and pull through it still side by side. We are still healing and still working things out. Yet, we decided this would be the right time to have a wedding. We have been through so much over the course of our relationship. After going through what we put ourselves through and still standing next to each other hand in hand, a wedding seemed to be the best idea. He's going to get me a ring for our 19th anniversary and we are shooting for our 20th to ve our wedding date.\n\nWe are whonwe are, and part of that is we are very untraditional. We are taking the time to plan our wedding mainly because we want it the way we want it and rather wait in order to make it happen the way we want. We are having a wedding for us, because it's what we want. We are not doing it for others. We are not doing it because we are jealous of someone else. It's for us and about us 100%.  We may be going overboard as our plan is to truly make it our wedding. We will be creating our own ceremony by pulling traditions from things that are important to us (I come from a Jewish family, the breaking of the glass is important) and leaving out things that are not (we will be writing our own ceremony out, not just the vows). We also won't be signing any paperwork or having any legal factor about it. There are a couple of reasons for that, but one of the main reasons is simply because we don't believe in adding a third party to our marriage that's not actually part of our marriage (i.e. the gov). \n\nHave your wedding. Get married before SIL if that's what you want, but don't stress yourself out to do it. I also would advise against getting married before sil just for the sake of getting married before her. Don't taint your wedding with that kind of energy. Although, personally I think you should say fuck you to all of them. You, your fiance, and your kids should elope. Have a \"destination\" wedding and the only people there isnyour little family. It will be much less drama. I wouldn't be surprised if the entire process, from planning to doing it, was a lot more fun this way. Maybe invite your parents or a friend couple. Someone who would be willing to watch your kids, at least for a little bit, so that the two of you can enjoy the two of you.\n\nGood luck, and congrats on both the baby and the engagement. Don't allow an insecure, entitled person to bring you down. She's not worth your energy or your time, and there is no reason she should be living rent-free in your head.", "Girl.

Assistance for what? He doesn't wanna put a ring on it, and the assistance is her father-in-law's gift to his son who wants to wife his woman. You're gonna steal that, too?
