Sure I\u2019ll invite people but I also probably won\u2019t talk to them If I\u2019m not close to them. That would be rude would it not?? It\u2019s hard for me to do so. I could invite people to the reception but the actual wedding part?? Why do people I\u2019m not close with HAVE to be there??", "Yeah I guess I just got too sidetracked with the conversation of wedding etiquette in general (which I think is dumb) but regardless OP shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to have somebody at such a private event simple because of a\u2026 I\u2019m not sure of the word but maybe mutual friend? It\u2019s just what\u2019s expected and expectations are really weird to me. Especially when it comes to events like this. I\u2019ve always had this attitude towards how I would want my wedding to be. A private event. Thank you for providing more of a open minded perspective.", "Emily Post wrote that etiquette was intended to minimize discomfort among guests due to ambiguity by being clear and predictable with social expectations written out. The fact that you have +1s for both guests meets this. \nI am sure there is an etiquette for all kinds of wedding topics that would provide some form of language for the interloper.", "You are a host, and you have invited guests. They are entitled to be treated well by their host, which means not excluding their spouse, making sure they have food and beverages, are comfortable, etc. If you don\u2019t want to have anyone you don\u2019t know well, you can do the kind of thing OP is doing and only have a tiny number of people in attendance. But if you have a normal gathering and don\u2019t include people\u2019s spouses, you are being a shitty host.\n\nThe idea that because your wedding is \u2018about you\u2019, you get to do whatever you want no matter how it impacts your guests is incredibly childish. And if you make a habit of hosting events and telling people they can\u2019t expect to be treated politely because they didn\u2019t pay for it\u2026please don\u2019t invite me.", "So if we don\u2019t care about etiquette then you don\u2019t care if a guest doesn\u2019t bring a gift, right?\nThe guests may not be paying the bills, but there is the social contract of giving a gift when you go to a wedding. They are shelling out money to attend in that way. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to allow them their spouse in an otherwise boring/uncomfortable social obligation event. Promise people don\u2019t actually want to be at your wedding for the funsies.", "How tf is your best man's partner a stranger, what the hell is wrong with Reddit", "> If you want to adhere to etiquette by all means go ahead. But it isn\u2019t being rude to not. \n\nIt would be rude. That is what etiquette means lol", "They have invited no guests at all. Just the two people who will stand up for the couple (and are probably their witnesses) and 1 photographer. There\u2019s no need to have a plus one.", "In this economy? And I am not close to you? Yea you can suck a turd. Call me childish but that event it NOT about the guests. It\u2019s my big day to celebrate the communion of a partnership. Not everyone is entitled to that. If you only see it as event sure you can have that mindset. But it\u2019s not like that for everyone. I stand my ground on this. I may be close with the best man or another guest and not their partner.", "I quite literally don\u2019t care if I receive gifts. Because it\u2019s not transactional to me. It is literally me sharing a moment. I should ask what the hell is wrong with yall???", "You don'5 have to give a gift though. Like? Weddings are insanely stupid for this very reason; ettiquette of weddings vary so widely depending on the culture so what may seem rude to someone is not rude to another. If someone doesn't want someone at THEIR wedding they're not obliged to have that person there. That's it. It doesn't matter if there is a gift, it's not a rule set in stone; at the end of the day this day is about the two people doing the ceremony, not the guests who are attending; especially not the \"guests\" who weren't even invited in the first place.", "I\u2019m talking in general but when did I ever say stranger??? I don\u2019t recall doing so. Knowing somebody well means different things to different people. I\u2019m autistic and personally a wedding is a big event to me and if I\u2019m not very close with someone or know them enough to share a special moment I will simply not invite them. Just because I am friends with somebody does not mean I am friends with their partner. It\u2019s an INVITE which in no way is obligatory. These \u201crules\u201d honestly are stupid imo and make zero sense to me.", "Etiquette is subjective \ud83e\udd37", "Having a wedding? In this economy? Why not just go courthouse and skip the theatrics? Stop being such a miser and understand that there are social rules for certain events. You can refuse to abide by them all you want, just don't expect it to not affect your relationships to people.", "But it is transactional sort of, and you said that?Like you\u2019re saying they didn\u2019t pay for anything for your wedding but, usually, large dollar amount gifts are bought for the couple to start their new life together. And they buy those things and attend your wedding because they care about you. Like someone else said you can have a small wedding if you want and not invite whoever you don\u2019t want to, but some people have a \u201cmore the merrier\u201d mindset and would invite a stranger off the street. \n\nIt honestly reads like you just hate hosting people, and that\u2019s fine, but not everybody feels that way.", "Don't hide behind autism as an excuse to be an asshole to your best man. FFS, if you have autism you should know by now that just because it doesn't make sense to you doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense.", "Some people may still have a celebration and that could be called a \u201cwedding\u201d", "Who is hiding?? And the world is different for everybody. I don\u2019t want someone at such a personal event who I\u2019m not close to plain and simple. If you wanna call me an asshole when I\u2019m paying for somebody to experience a moment between me and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Weddings are a big business anyways. Thats all it is. I dont care about inviting extra people who I\u2019m not close with. Sure would it be nice? I guess. but I shouldn\u2019t be obligated to share a moment like that with somebody who I don\u2019t have a close relationship with."]}
