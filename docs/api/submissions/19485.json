He can choose to highly value not going to such event without his partner and so refuse to be the best man.", "Personally I believe if a traditional wedding ceremony is so much that you two would rather not be married what exactly is the point of the wedding ceremony at all? Just go to the courthouse and take pictures yourself no point in alienating one specific person. If one person is enough to ruin the entire day you are simply not ready to get married", "NTA but try rephrasing it perhaps: this is not a wedding, but a marriage ceremony. you are each inviting one friend and together you are inviting a photographer. this is nothing against roger, you just don't want to invite more people.", "NAH. \nIt's strange but fine for you to have such a small wedding and not make an exception. \nIt's also reasonable for them Frederick and Roger to be upset and not want to come if they can't both come. \n\nMost in your position would have made the guest list slightly larger from the start. Small wedding party, immediate family, and plus ones. \n\nBut it's your wedding and you can do as you want. The bestan and his partner may not change their minds but they'll calm down eventually", "NTA. FWIW, my spouse attended a similar unconventional small wedding and I wasn\u2019t invited. It was no problem.", "If Roger doesn't want to come without his partner, respect his wishes & choose another best man.", "NTA and Roger needs to stop being a drama...er....llama.  Have a celebration party and he can come to that.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt is your wedding. It is your choice who you'd like to invite or not invite. No one should have the right to complain about it.\n\nThis Roger is being very disrespectful and extremely demanding of Frederick. It's just ONE wedding that he's not invited to. I'm not sure what's the big deal since he's not even close to you two love birds (congrats btw!). Besides, you've specified that you wanted just a small group of people who are close to you. Roger should just go chill out somewhere. It's not like Frederick was going to be gone for 1 month either.", "First off, I'm leaning to NAH more than anything else. This is a weird one because of how the situation is playing out. And ultimately I'm not sure whether to stick with NAH or go to ESH.\n\nWith your very specific situation, you get to use the rule \"Our wedding, our choice\" without major consequence, which normally doesn't get a pass with more traditional large weddings. You both specifically have your best friend from each of you and a photographer. What you want is what you should get with regards to this.\n\nThat said, consider very carefully if this is something you want to have as a thorn in your side with your friendship with Frederik, and  in extension, Roger. You can stick to your guns here and have a potential issue that will result in an ended friendship as the worst case scenario here, or you lose your best man, or you retain him with a cloud of negativity over the wedding with a strained friendship. Or you can save it with an extra invite or two, one for Roger, and one for a plus one for Maria, likely her own spouse/partner, if she has one to bring. I would argue that it would be best practice and the polite thing to do to invite the significant other/spouse/partner of your best man and maid of honor. Those two specific extra invites should not be that big of a deal between you and your fianc\u00e9e. And if it is going to be that big of an issue, dig into why and resolve that first.", "Okay first of all roger is a big jerk cause its your wedding not rogers and if you want a simple wedding you can and they're not special", "NTA. If I wasn\u2019t invited to a wedding, somehow weaseled my way into it, and then found out there\u2019s only like 5 people I would feel so horrible.", "NTA. It's your wedding, invite who you want. The fact that Roger is being a child and not seeing that this isn't a standard wedding where everyone is bringing a plus one is absurd.", "NTA. Just position it as you need 2 witnesses to sign the document.  Roger needs to settle down.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re being ridiculous. Find a replacement witness.", "NTA.  If you were having a large event with family and friends (Or if you were letting the other guests bring SO\u2019s) - I would say differently. \n\nBut this is very clearly a very personal and small event. \nPlus what would Roger do?  He would be bored. This isn\u2019t a traditional wedding.", "I will never understand asking someone in your wedding to exclude their plus one. It will always make you an AH in my book.", "I'm going to go with ESH \n\nGroom because while it's \"his wedding his rules\" he is hunky-dorky fine with causing problems in his best man's relationship.\n\nRoger for allowing this to become a point of contention in their relationship.\n\nFrederik for accepting an invite that didn't include his partner.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having a small no thrills wedding. But when you are icing out your invitees partners you could/obviously are creating tensions in their relationships, and being ok with creating that tension is pretty sucky. Personally, I would never accept an invite that didn't include my wife. Even were it from my best friend. It's just plan terrible.", "Exactly. The bride and groom are having 3 guests. Roger can chill.", "Can you please have some sort of conversation with my bestie from college? My fiance and I are getting married next week, in our home, with our moms as witnesses.

All 3 persons who will be attending have a \u201especific job\u201c during the ceremony (2 witnesses, 1 photographer) and are our closest friends. We thought about a lot and this is exactly the way we want to start our marriage. We were not invited when Frederik and Roger got married because they also had a small ceremony.

But out of interest is Roger often this demanding or unreasonable?", "Is your event really that special if two more people attending could ruin it? I mean, they're not even random people, they're people who are very much important to the people who are very much important to you. Think how that will reflect upon your invited friends in the long term, both in their friendships with you, and their relationships with their significant others going forward.\n\n  \nAt the end of the day, you do you, but the fewer people you include in your life, the fewer who will want to be there.", "Accepting an invite where your partner is excluded for no reason other than \"We are only inviting 3 people\" is kinda f'ed up too.", "What's the story?", "Thank you for confirming.
