Apparently I was wrong. \nHis sister (F25) unfollowed and removed me from her social media. I had her cell number so I texted her asking why. She responded with \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you but I deleted everyone except family. You can reach me through my number if you need to get ahold of me.\u201d When I showed my fianc\u00e9 he felt like she was being rude and assured me the rest of the family does not share her view of me. This is where it gets dicey. \n\nHer and her boyfriend let\u2019s call him J have been together for 5 months. At the family Christmas party she made a remark about not seeing why I was invited because I\u2019m not a part of the family and their mother defended me and my fianc\u00e9 said her boyfriend is not part of the family either so he shouldn\u2019t have been invited either. She didn\u2019t like that and told my fianc\u00e9 that he was being rude and making J feel like an outsider.\n\nNow we are working on invitations for our wedding. We are planning on keeping it quite small- only family and maybe a couple close friends. I was feeling really petty and decided to let her know that her invite did not include J because we are only inviting family. She hasn\u2019t responded yet but I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty and like maybe I should just drop the petty revenge and take it back. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add that my fianc\u00e9 has 4 siblings counting her and I have 3. All of my singlings are single and all of his are too except her, so plus ones weren\u2019t a thing we were even thinking about until she started being a hater, lol.\nAdditional info: future MIL and FIL both stuck up for me on Christmas and told her there\u2019s no reason for her to act like I\u2019m not part of the family after all this time. My parents think I\u2019m being petty, but that she deserves it. My mother said something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s so bad, but it\u2019s so good.\u201d Fianc\u00e9 says not inviting her is too far (I agree) but that there\u2019s no reason for J to be invited anyway. We don\u2019t know him and nobody else is bringing a plus one so why should she?", "created_utc": 1672635637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1013uwn/aita_for_not_allowing_my_fianc\u00e9s_sister_to_bring/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, I support this petty and admittedly a-hole approach, but my partner tells me I live off of spite. Although if you do want a small wedding, this person is pretty much a stranger to you. You are not obligated to invite them for that reason without being an a-hole. I'm gonna go with NTA.", "YTA and I am glad you are. Lol.

If you do this and make the reason clear, it becomes a \u2018you\u2019re as bad as each other\u2019 scenario to everyone else.\n\nAlso think about your wedding day and how you want to spend it. How miserable will your day be if you have to spend more time with her sulking about how mean you are?

Plus Ones are not being offered to anyone who isn't legally married or specifically invited themselves. \n\nPetty? Sure. But turn about is fair play and she started the game. She now has to play by the rules she set when she \"removed everyone not family\" and then complained about you being at a family event. Sucks to suck, future SIL.

Personally I wouldn\u2019t antagonize her because it will get worse but you also shouldn\u2019t be a doormat.  Get on the same page with your new husband going forward, how she treats you is not okay.  Find a way of doing things, you can live with, you shouldn\u2019t give her way every time but you also don\u2019t want to exhaust yourself answering every slight with the same energy.

And that's not always the worst thing.", "ESH. In a vacuum it looks like she's being shitty, but we don't have enough information to judge why this might be happening. I'm not suggesting it's deserved; just that there isn't enough context. You're being petty and tbh it's really not gonna be worth the drama. Just invite him and move on.", "ESH. she\u2019s being weird about the social media thing, but she\u2019s still going to be your sister in law so why create more drama. end of the day up to you though", "NTA but still best to be the bigger person here.

NTA\n\nOP my husband and I are also middle school sweethearts and I feel your sentiments on family dynamics. I also can appreciate how your SIL would be upset by what she would call a slight to her bf. I know my BILs wife is still learning the ins and outs and struggles with my now 18 year relationship with my parents in law and how she doesn't have the same rapport.

Just make sure your fiance is on-board with it before he's officially off the guest list.", "Well, according to her own logic he is not \u201cfamily\u201d enough. You can take the moral high ground here, but do u think she is the kind of person who is gonna understand that you\u2019re being a bigger person or will she take it as a win and show up at your wedding with her bf and a smirk on her face.", "If you\u2019re looking for open warfare that both sides of your family will have to negotiate for decades, by all means, enjoy yourself, be petty.
