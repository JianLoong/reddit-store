She has 2 kids (8M and 13M).  \n\n\nBefore the school year started, I'm a sophomore in HS, and I asked my dad if I could move in with them so I could attend the school in their district. My mom's district school is much worse than the one in my stepmom's district. He said no, that there were a lot of things going on in our lives at the moment, and we all needed time to adapt to the changes.  \n\n\nI used to spend weekends with my dad, but I started working to save money for college, so I won't be going there every weekend.  \n\n\nLast night, my dad messaged me asking if I could help my stepbrother with the test he's taking this Friday. My dad knows I'm a great student \u2013 I was the top of my class last year \u2013 so he thought I could assist my stepbrother.  \n\n\nI told my dad that I wouldn't help my stepbrother. I explained that I'm involved in ECs, so I don't have time, and it's not feasible for me to go to his house to assist.  \n\n\nMy dad said he would pick me up every day after school and bring me back after dinner. He emphasized how crucial it was for my stepbrother to do well on the test because my stepmom wants to enroll him in a good prep school.  \n\n\nI got upset about this because when I asked to live with them for a better school, education wasn't a top priority for my dad. I replied that I wouldn't help them at all because they didn't help me when I needed it.  \n\n\nHe said I'm not helping our family integrate and that I should act like an older brother. He believes this would only harm my relationship with my stepbrother. He said that he would call me the next day.  \n\n\nToday, my mom asked to talk. She said my dad talked to her, and she thought I should help. She said that if I don't, my stepbrother might become resentful, which could affect our relationship forever. Even though we are not blood related, we're now a family, and we should act like one, according to her. I told my mom that I didn't feel they acted like a family when they didn't want me to move in. She said the decision is mine, but she believed I was wrong.  \n\n\nMy mom and I live with my grandparents. My grandpa noticed that my mom and I had a serious conversation, and I told him what happened. He said the decision is mine, but it would indeed harm my relationship with my dad's new family.  \n\n\nMy dad called me, and I told him I wouldn't help them, they could hire a tutor. He said he'd pay me to go if that was the issue, but I said that wasn't the problem; the problem was that he didn't give the same importance to my education.  \n\n\nMy dad said the problem is that I always think of myself and that I'd eventually realize I was wrong, expressing his disappointment in me. He said he helps me with my education as best as he can, just as he's trying to assist my stepbrother. He said that if I change my mind, I could call him, and he'd pick me up.  \n\n\nI still think I'm right. They didn't help me when I asked for it, so I have no reason to help them.", "created_utc": 1696822915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173i9tz/aita_for_not_helping_my15m_stepbrother_13m_with/", "score": 301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most likely your step brother's mom is applying pressure.\n\nThe fact your Dad has failed to demonstrate love for his eldest is not the fault of your step brother.

Dad has two more kids now to take care of and is juggling his priorities to support all three kids, not just one.\n\nOP is frustrated the lost opportunity to go to the better school, but it seems that stepbrother 13M is struggling in school to some extent and perhaps parents felt 13M's grades would suffer if his environment changed while OP is already quite successful.\n\nIdeally dad would have gotten a bigger apartment, OP would have moved in, everyone's grades would have been great and there would have been no friction as OP inserted into dad's new family.  Sounds like a really boring movie.  Life tends not to be perfect.  Dad sounds like he couldn't afford to move, bunkbeds didn't seem like a viable option with 13M, etc...etc... Dad and bio Mom seem like they sure could have handled things better.
