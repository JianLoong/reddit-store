She has 2 kids (8M and 13M).  \n\n\nBefore the school year started, I'm a sophomore in HS, and I asked my dad if I could move in with them so I could attend the school in their district. My mom's district school is much worse than the one in my stepmom's district. He said no, that there were a lot of things going on in our lives at the moment, and we all needed time to adapt to the changes.  \n\n\nI used to spend weekends with my dad, but I started working to save money for college, so I won't be going there every weekend.  \n\n\nLast night, my dad messaged me asking if I could help my stepbrother with the test he's taking this Friday. My dad knows I'm a great student \u2013 I was the top of my class last year \u2013 so he thought I could assist my stepbrother.  \n\n\nI told my dad that I wouldn't help my stepbrother. I explained that I'm involved in ECs, so I don't have time, and it's not feasible for me to go to his house to assist.  \n\n\nMy dad said he would pick me up every day after school and bring me back after dinner. He emphasized how crucial it was for my stepbrother to do well on the test because my stepmom wants to enroll him in a good prep school.  \n\n\nI got upset about this because when I asked to live with them for a better school, education wasn't a top priority for my dad. I replied that I wouldn't help them at all because they didn't help me when I needed it.  \n\n\nHe said I'm not helping our family integrate and that I should act like an older brother. He believes this would only harm my relationship with my stepbrother. He said that he would call me the next day.  \n\n\nToday, my mom asked to talk. She said my dad talked to her, and she thought I should help. She said that if I don't, my stepbrother might become resentful, which could affect our relationship forever. Even though we are not blood related, we're now a family, and we should act like one, according to her. I told my mom that I didn't feel they acted like a family when they didn't want me to move in. She said the decision is mine, but she believed I was wrong.  \n\n\nMy mom and I live with my grandparents. My grandpa noticed that my mom and I had a serious conversation, and I told him what happened. He said the decision is mine, but it would indeed harm my relationship with my dad's new family.  \n\n\nMy dad called me, and I told him I wouldn't help them, they could hire a tutor. He said he'd pay me to go if that was the issue, but I said that wasn't the problem; the problem was that he didn't give the same importance to my education.  \n\n\nMy dad said the problem is that I always think of myself and that I'd eventually realize I was wrong, expressing his disappointment in me. He said he helps me with my education as best as he can, just as he's trying to assist my stepbrother. He said that if I change my mind, I could call him, and he'd pick me up.  \n\n\nI still think I'm right. They didn't help me when I asked for it, so I have no reason to help them.", "created_utc": 1696822915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173i9tz/aita_for_not_helping_my15m_stepbrother_13m_with/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm your son and you did not acted like my dad, so why are you angry at me of not acting like a brother to someone else\u00bb.   \nBut maybe you can ask him to pay you, but like an unfair amount (llike 20-25$/hour, by saying that is his way he can get things equal and fair for your education for you to be able to pay better schoooling next year)", "NTA, if they think it's that super important they should send your stepbrother to extra classes or tuition. Idk how it works there but you get the point. Also, good job on standing up for yourself especially on your current age. Keep this up, just know that the only reason people will be resentful is because they can't take advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nYour father prioritized his new family and his step-son\u2019s education over yours.

He needs to learn good study habits and he's at the age where he should be able figure it out. \n\nYes, he'll stumble a few times but that's normal and good for him. That's how he'll really learn. And when he does well? He'll feel the best sense of accomplishment because he did it himself.", "NTA. I have kids your age and your dad's behaviour is pretty crappy.", "NTA... But your mom does have a point.\n\nYour dad seems to be prioritizing keeping his new wife happy, which while somewhat understandable is unfair to you and unfortunate. It's not right that he's not standing up for your education, and you're not wrong to notice that.\n\nThat said, your mom does also have a point. If you take the high road and help even though it's not fair, that could have significant relationship benefits through the rest of your life. You're NTA in that you're not obligated to do so, but at the same time, it might be a good decision to help even though it's not something you should be expected to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And when are you supposed to find time to study if you're at school all day and helping your stepbrother for hours after school every day? You'll be worn out before you even sit down to do your own work. Your father is selfish. He clearly favors your stepbrother over you. Do not cave into their emotional blackmail. And I bet they wouldn't pay you at all or if they did it wouldn't be half as much as they'd pay another tutor. And if you say yes they'll demand that you help your stepbrother with more homework, more tests, etc.", "I remember your previous posts about your father and his new family. If this is real and not a multi-part saga by a creative writer, I\u2019m sorry your father and stepmother are treating you like a second class citizen yet again. \n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for you because I\u2019m a Reddit stranger and don\u2019t have any personal experience or professional training to deal with your situation, but what I can tell you is that the adults in your life are failing you. They are unfair and wrong, no matter how they try to manipulate you. Your father and stepmother are despicable for trying to exploit you to help your stepbrother when they couldn\u2019t be bothered to treat you like an equal member of their family, and your mom and grandpa are pathetic for allowing them to pressure you. \n\n(If you\u2019re a creative writer, good job, I was emotionally affected enough to reply seriously and that almost never happens anymore.)", "I\u2019ve read some of your previous posts and I still think your dad and your mom are AHs. They expect to much of you and to always be the one to appease everyone. Basically your mom is raising you to be a doormat. Tell your dad that it is his responsibility to blend the families, not yours. And that you will not sacrifice your ECs, that is important for your education, just so you can do his job for him. \n\nAlso tell him that it is unfair of him to put the entire weight of blending families on you. That you are just as much a kid as his steps and that he isn\u2019t taking that into consideration when he keeps putting demands and pressure on you. That he should focus on creating good relationships BEFORE he starts pushing for favors.

He believes this would only harm my relationship with my stepbrother.\n\nAnd yet, rejecting your chance to be closer at hand to possibly bond with his family did help?

There are no friends, fellow students, teachers, tutors, nobody?  Heck of a test there.\n\nYou are not required to help anyone, blood relation or not.  Yes, do I look back on choices I made in life and think that I could have made the choice to be kind instead of right?  Sure.

Believe him", "NTA. Your dad is prioritizing his stepson over you. \n\nWhat none of them care about is that you resent your dad for not letting you move in for a better school and to add insult to injury he asked you to tutor his stepson.

Step-brother won't like to know the only times he gets with OP is because father is paying him.", "100% agree. There is no blame to put on a 15 yo kid who did try to build something.   \nThe blame is on the father.", "Seriously, minimum wage at McDonalds in my town pays $22 (I believe, might be $20) an hour. Tutoring requires previous education and experience within the skillset - if I were OP I\u2019d def ask for $25 minimum.", "i was thinking about the minimum wage+10$ in my country. Glad people are more paid.

My main point was that it was worth considering longer term situations and building a relationship with the step brother. Definitely shouldn't approach that as just an obligation."]}
