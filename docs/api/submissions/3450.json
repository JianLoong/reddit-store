{"id": 3450, "submission_id": "z6yk8o", "title": "AITA for making my sister take away my nephews phone on Thanksgiving?", "selftext": " \n\nMy husband (42m) and I (42f) hosted Thanksgiving this year. My brother (44m) and sister (47f) came with their families, as did our parents. Including my kids, there are 8 grandchildren, including my brother\u2019s son Caleb, who is 13 and my sister\u2019s son Chaz, who is 10.\n\nIn our family, we don\u2019t dress up for Thanksgiving. Caleb dressed up like he normally does, wearing a Vineyard Vines shirt, shorts, and Nike. He\u2019s the type of athletic boy who wears shorts when it\u2019s cold out, my brother and his wife have stopped fighting him about it, he\u2019s a good and caring kid who gets good grades. Caleb was also wearing a bunch of those rubber/silicone bracelets, these ones were related to various sports teams. He wears them daily, as do a lot of kids who wear these rubber bracelets, I\u2019ve seen it on a lot of kids. Caleb is the sport fanatic and athlete of the family, he loves these bracelets. He was watching football for a bit before deciding to play with Nick (3m). Nick is the son of the oldest grandchild in the family, Madison (16f), who got pregnant at 13. The dad, Connor (16m), is still around and dating Madison. He loves Nick and is a great guy, but was at Thanksgiving with his family and Nick stayed with us. Connor is an athlete, and Nick seems to be like dad in that regard, he is currently in the same soccer program Caleb was in at that age (Caleb asked to do soccer that young), Nick is a rambunctious kid. Madison is my sister\u2019s daughter. \n\nWhile Caleb and Nick were playing outside together, Chaz came out into the backyard. Caleb and Nick were kicking a soccer ball, with Caleb trying to teach him some skills. While no one was outside with them, we could see them through the glass doors and all the adults were in the kitchen/dining room and could see what was happening outside. Chaz was taking photos of what was happening, eventually the kids were called in to eat and it became too dark out for the kids to play inside, so Caleb and Nick went into the toy room to watch some documentary about one of Caleb\u2019s favorite baseball players. Chaz went into the room while they were watching and asked to play Minecraft with him and Nick. As they were playing Minecraft, Chaz made multiple comments calling Caleb\u2019s outfit \u201cgay\u201d for wearing bracelets and made fun of what he was building in Minecraft. Caleb came out to tell us what was happening. He had mentioned that Chaz was taking photos of them earlier. At that point, I ask to see Chaz\u2019s phone, he refused until I offer him candy. He was calling Caleb \u201cgay\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d and other things to his friends in a group text. \n\nChaz is a mean kid and has a history of bullying kids in school.. I told my sister to take his phone away for the rest of the night, she said it would only make Chaz worse. I said if she didn\u2019t, I\u2019d ask her to leave. She reluctantly did and he was an ass for the rest of the night. She blames me, I said she needs to teach Chaz manners.

Chaz sounds like he was being a bully and deserved some form of punishment.", "NTA\n\nThis crossed a line when Chaz made it about sexuality. For him to be humiliating his cousin to his friends like that at such a young age is seriously concerning, and I'm glad you felt something was off enough to check out where the photos were going.\n\nThis isn't about you 'parenting someone else's kid', this is your nephew. A member of your family, in your home. You had every right. On top of that, you were doing it to get to the bottom of him bullying your child. You were acting to protect your child.\n\nYou didn't attack Chaz or call him names or force him to do hard labor or something. I think others on this thread are simultaneously underreacting to what really matters, and overreacting to what is classically seen as overstepping. (Which, in America, is often just \"I know i don't parent my kid but that doesn't mean YOU can\")\n\nI'm relieved you're stepping up for your son. It's so damaging when your first bullies are your own family. \n\nGood luck. What a mess.", "NTA, what a wild coincidence that a child named \"Chaz\" would turn out like that!", "This one is hard. On one hand it's your house so you can set the rules. on the other it really should have been up to his mother to set a punishment for him. I'm going with NTA because if little assholes are not put in their place they become adult assholes.", "ESH. Chaz sucks for being mean. Your sister sucks for tolerating bullying behavior. You suck for trying to parent someone else\u2019s kid - prescribing and insisting on a certain punishment instead of sharing the relevant information and asking her to deal with it - and for writing this nightmare of a post with a million unnecessary details and characters.", "NTA. His parents need to address the bullying and homophobic name calling this is bad news. It's your house and I know this might not be the popular opinion but I think you did the right thing I would have called him out too and shame on his mom for letting him act that way.", "NTA as far as I see it you weren't parenting those kids you were laying down rules in your house. Chaz is an asshole and he's being taught that being an asshole gets you what you want by his mom, and he's doing it infront of a 3 year old. Tell your sister exactly what happened and why you set those rules, and tell her if she wants to encourage that behavior by all means do it in HER home never in yours.", "ESH. Let your sister parent her bad kid, you're out of line for digging through his phone messages. \n\nAnd did you really need to fill the post with all that irrelevant nonsense just to get to \"My nephew is a bully toward his cousins\"?", "You were NYA. That bully / kid needs therapy . Bullying others is very damaging", "The bribe was definitely unnecessary and troublesome in my eyes, but I will still vote NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s about time someone called out his bullying behavior. It\u2019s your home, you gave them 2 options, they chose the first.", "YTA for taking a child\u2019s phone and digging around in their text messages. YTA for trying to parent a child that isn\u2019t yours.", "NTA, it's your house... Maybe he won't act like a little shit at your house now that he knows you won't put up with it.", "YTA. It wasn't your place to go through your nephew's phone to read his messages. Especially as you bribed him to do this - not good. If you have concerns, you get your sister, his mother, to investigate. \n\nFor what it's worth, I agree Chaz needs to be disciplined for this. But not by you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just because he's not her kid, doesn't mean just sit by and let him misbehave.\n\nThis is literally why people hate going out in public and seeing kids there. Not because they hate kids. Because they know that some people don't parent their misbehaving kid(s) and it ruins the experience for everyone. It's rude and selfish.\n\nNow granted this isn't a public situation, but it still applies. They were in OPs home and were being disrespectful.
