I am an asexual woman. Henry has of course accepted, and supported me. My family, on the other hand, has not been supportive, although they claim to be allies of the LGBT community.\n\nAfter the proposal, we began planning, the topic of bachelor/bachelorette parties was brought up. Henry and I talked, and had our party planners agree on some \"rules\" about these parties. Now I am not insecure about my relationship with Henry in any way, and have never been, and I know Henry would never ever cheat on me, and I would never ever cheat on him. As a person who had never been too fond of such parties, we decided on; 1, no strippers or anything of the sort , 2, don't drink too much (my personal choice).\n\nAs I mentioned before, my family had never been accepting of my asexuality, and liked to make fun of it, going out of their way to make me uncomfortable.\n\nSo onto today, the day of this party i've been dreading for weeks. I walk in and there are bright pink dicks everywhere; confetti, candy, the cake, and plastered all over the wall, it looked like someone grabbed any dick themed item at a Spencer's and threw it all over my living room. Barely clothed men danced around my house, so. much. alcohol. I was standing there stunned. I felt super dizzy, and the next thing I knew I was over the toilet throwing up. I just kept asking \"why\" over and over again. My cousins were laughing. I thought I had been completely clear about how uncomfortable this shit made me, and they still went and did this to me. I was pissed. When I stopped, I cleaned myself up and went into my living room to end the party. I told my cousins that I was absolutely disgusted, and felt betrayed that they went against all my boundaries, and asked that the party be ended. They laughed. So I left.\n\nIt didn't take long for them to start blowing up my phone with call and texts calling me as many curses as I had taught them in our youth, I didn't even have time to call my fiance or anything! I sat in my car, and through sobs, I called and explained to Henry everything that had happened, and he was understandably sorry and pissed at my cousins. He offered to pick me up to join his friends, but I told him that it was his day and he needed to have fun with his friends, but he insisted. When he had finished calming me down, I texted my cousin a simple \"have fun without me.\" and went to a cafe, where I'm now writing this, waiting to be swooped up and rescued by my fiance.\n\nShould I uninvite them from my wedding? Am I being too harsh? I mean, after all that, and you still couldn't get the dicks in blue? Or strippers that were my type?\n\nTLDR: My cousins went against my wishes and boundaries giving me a dick themed bachelorette party with male strippers I specifically asked for there not to be, and they got mad at me for being disgusted and leaving.", "created_utc": 1667105883, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh4zdp/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_bachelorette_party/", "score": 1030, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We went to Vernont in the USA, where the bed and breakfasts all offer elopement packages, and got married surrounded by beautiful scenery with not a single person around us to stir up shit or turn our love for one another into a spectacle. \n\nIt was peaceful and beautiful and the photos are gorgeous.

I'm so happy for you and your Husband to be! Stand your ground!", "NTA. How difficult is it for your family to just accept that you aren't into those sort of things?!? Screw your cousins for doing that, they were being intentionally cruel.", "NTA - my cousins thought it was funny to bring bachelorette themed gifts to my bridal shower. I did not have a bachelorette party since I am very uncomfortable with the themes attached to it. So I opened a bag of toys and other themed things in front of my grandparents and my great grandmother. I started bawling because I was mortified and went to the back room of the house.

They don't deserve to see you get married or come to your reception.  Not even if they spent a lot of money on dresses, tickets, or hotel stays.", "NTA. \n\nI mean, I love the male form quite a bit, but a bachelor party with fake wang and strange naked men dancing around is awful.", "NTA. But I guess I\u2019m not sure why your family needs to know if you are into having sex or not. It\u2019s one thing to come out to your family if you are gay/straight/trans but I\u2019m unclear why it\u2019s any of their business what goes on in your bedroom?

Don\u2019t make assumptions - there may have been no evil intent - that needs to be established. A decision made in haste based on assumptions can have serious unintended ramifications.\n\nAs for the wedding, most people know to behave themselves at a wedding until the alcohol flows and even then, you don\u2019t have to be homosexual to have issues\u2026 weddings can be complicated by lots of history.

I can \"pass\" for straight.\"    \nBut what about aces who are homoromantic, biromantic, etc?   They don't pass as easily.  They are told they are gay and in denial about it.  But they aren't gay.
