{"id": 34384, "submission_id": "18z8fpq", "title": "AITA for telling my brother he did put his wife's wants before his kids?", "selftext": "My brother has two children from his marriage to his late wife Denise. His son just turned 20 and his daughter is 18.  Denise died when the children were 6 and 7 years old. 18 months later my brother met Katherine, his second wife and they married after four months of knowing each other. Katherine was unable to have biological children and she always dreamed of being a mom and wanted to be a mom to my nephew and niece. My brother wanted this for her also. But the kids did not want to be Katherine's children. They did not want to call her mom or be adopted by her, they did not want her to be the sole focus of mother's day, etc.\n\nMy brother spent years trying to get the children to call Katherine mom. He and Katherine applied for her to adopt the kids and were rejected by the judge after she spoke to the children about what they wanted. They tried again and were denied by a different judge before making it to court.\n\nThings were always tense with my brother and his children. It was also tense with the rest of the family because some of us spoke up and asked him why he was pushing this on his children so much. He would say Katherine deserved to be a mom and deserved the respect for being a loving and nurturing mother to the kids.\n\nMother's Day from the first year they were married until last year was very toxic. My brother no longer allowed the kids to see their maternal relatives that day and they also didn't see any of us or visit the grave. He said the day in their family was for Katherine. He would make her breakfast and give her cards and gifts from the kids. Then the kids would tell her she didn't deserve to be celebrated for Mother's Day and she was nobody's mother. My brother didn't like it and Katherine would be upset at the reminder. The kids would also be quick to inform Katherine they never wrote in the cards. Because my brother always addressed them \"to mom\" and the kids never called her that.\n\nIn the last few months my brother has lost contact with his children. The last time they spoke to their dad, the kids told him they put Katherine's wants before them and they would never forgive him for that. They said he had no right to insist they be the children to fill the void for her when they already had a mom who they loved. My brother dismissed the idea entirely that he put Katherine before the kids like that. When I saw him for New Years at my parents house he was telling me about it and I told him the kids were right and he did put Katherine's wants before the kids. I said he made her want to be a mother the most important thing and tried to force the kids to comply and be her kids. He told me that was not what happened and I should be sympathetic to him and to Katherine who had her heart broken by the kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704465701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z8fpq/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_did_put_his_wifes/", "score": 5960, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just repeated that scream.", "[removed]", "NTA. Those kids may have called her mom in their own time, if they had been given the chance. That will likely never happen now.", "NTA, wow.\n\nI'm not surprised they cut contact, you got it 100% right, he prioritised his new wife's imagined motherhood over his children\n\nI feel somewhat bad for Katherine too, wanting children and not having them is traumatic, and her new husband promised her the world and in doing so poisoned her chance at a form of motherhood\n\n\\> Katherine who had her heart broken by the kids\n\nKatherine's heart was broken by your brother, not the kids", "NTA. I\u2019m glad the kids have sensible adults like you on their side. It\u2019s infuriating when a dad and stepmother try to erase mom like that. The children were 6 and 7 years old when they lost their mom, I\u2019m sure they adored her, and presenting them with a \u201creplacement\u201d barely two years later is ludicrously insensitive. I\u2019m really surprised that the judges who denied the adoption (twice! How could your brother and Katherine not get the message?) didn\u2019t have some pointed things to say about this situation, but then if your brother and his wife weren\u2019t listening to the kids they weren\u2019t listening to anyone, I guess.\n\nIf Katherine couldn\u2019t have children that\u2019s sad for her, but Denise\u2019s children aren\u2019t there to fill the void. As is always true in these cases, if dad and Katherine hadn\u2019t pushed the issue, if they\u2019d used Mother\u2019s Day to remember and honor Denise, if they\u2019d gone to visit the grave as a family, the kids might well have come to love Katherine. Not like their mom exactly, but like a member of the family. She had a better shot at effectively being a mom by not insisting so hard on being THE mom.", "NTA- from a young person who lost their mom (I\u2019m 23 lost my mom 5 years ago) losing a parent is trauma enough, having a new parent forced on you in unthinkable. Katherine and your brother could have adopted a child out of foster care, etc. if she really craved to be a mother this badly. I feel so bad for these 2 kids, and if setting boundaries with their dad will help their mental health I do not blame them a bit.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand how these stories are so common. Part of me feels like it\u2019s fake because they get the most responses on here but a part of me can\u2019t get over the fact that more often than not these stories are about men erasing wives after they die. Yeah women do it too but more often than not it\u2019s the men. They\u2019re quick to leave and move on from a dying wife statistically so it makes me believe these are likely true. Just sad as shit and makes me terrified to have a kid", "Okay, I'm a woman who always wanted kids and to be called mom. \n\nYou know how I would have gotten those kids approval...by helping them make mother's day stuff for their actual mom and letting them have little spaces for her in their rooms where they could visit and talk if they needed. \n\nThen once they did get on board I'd just tell them to think of some kind of special name they want to use, if they did want to use one. \n\nIt's the relationship that was important... Not the title. \n\nNTA. Always watch out for your siblings.", "The bitter irony to all this is that if Katherine had just tried to be the best stepmom ever, and loved those kids, while still honoring and appreciating their late mother, she might have eventually been seen as \"bonus mom\". Kids respond to respect and love.\n\nMy grandson loves his stepmother very much, and definitely views her as mom. Eventually even started calling her mom. His mother (my daughter) is not in his life for <handwaves away a long depressing explanation> sad reasons, and \"Mindy\" just stepped in and loved him.

His children going no-contact with him is a direct consequence of his actions, and if he can\u2019t acknowledge that then that\u2019s on him.

You can't force kids to accept a step parent as a parent, and that is what your brother and Sil did.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was so focused on his wife's desire to be a mom that now he's not a dad.", "NTA\nThere is a reason 2 judges denied their request to adopt. The kids get to chose.", "NTA he is delusional and now reaps what he sowed for a decade now", "NTA. They have decided they cannot be wrong and cannot deal with people thinking otherwise.", "Nta. Make sure you bring up how well they are in front of the ur brother and sil. Also make sure you say things the kids are just like their mother and stuff. Really drive in the kids point.", "NTA.  \n\n\nMaybe if he didn't try to force the relationship between Katherine and kids they would found way to build a healthy relationship between them. It probably wouldn't be mother-child relationship, since kids never wanted to replace their bio mom which is understandable, but it wouldn't be toxic.  \n\n\nOP you just told him how it is. He kept forcing the relationship because Katherine wanted it to the point they grew disdain instead of love. He has only himself to blame for his situation.", "He will never admit they\u2019re in the wrong here, because if he admits to it, he\u2019ll have to face the fact he failed his children and that\u2019s all his fault.", "NTA, what you told him is exactly what happened. He put his new wife's feelings before his children, and continued to do so until he pushed to no/low contact. This is entirely on him. It sucks to realize that you fucked up as a parent, but he did and he has to live with that now. He can choose to deny what he's done and if he decides that this is the hill he wants to die on, so to speak, than he should be prepared that he may never have a relationship with his children.", "NTA. When will people realize that you cannot force kids to accept a stranger as their new parent? It has to be their choice. Especially when the kids are probably still grieving that lost parent.", "NTA.\n\nYou can't force a relationship. Kids aren't toys that can be shoved and squished into fitting something. Your brother, frankly, needed to have been told that years ago. Now it's to late and I doubt he'll ever really hear from his children again in any meaningful ways. He'll learn of graduations and important events second hand at best or being pointedly and specifically not-invited to events.\n\nYes, your brother has a right to re-marry and I don't think Katherine is wrong to want to feel like part of the family, but his children also deserved the right to have their boundaries respected. If they'd been allowed room, there probably could have been a relationship, but your brother didn't give them that room. He wanted to force them into a specific space instead of working to find a mutually acceptable compromise.", "NTA he still doesn't get it. You are 200000% right. He pushed those kids away especially when they were still grieving their mother. Honestly him and Katherine are both delusional and this is the consequences of his actions", "NTA. She knew before she met him that she couldn\u2019t have children by her own. I don\u2019t have a good feeling about that story ; like she was looking desesperatly for a man with children. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is how your brother didn\u2019t pay attention after the judgment to his children feelings ? Nope. He tried a second time ! And now he doesn\u2019t understand what he did wrong ? \n\nHow was Christmas with all family ?", "NTA\n\nYou spoke the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. Sad thing is, without the pressure, the kids might have seen and accepted her as a motherly figure eventually.", "You cannot force children like that. My father passed away when I was 5 years old and after my mom remarried she gave us a choice on what to call my stepdad. She said it was entirely up to us. We ended up asking him to adopt us several years later (he had always wanted this but we were never pushed) and I truly believe that had we been forced to love him we would have turned away.", "NTA. I get so aggrevated also by those people that one hand claim to want to be a mom so bad but on the other hand never want to put the actual work in and just force the issue. If she took the time and energy she forced into being a nuisance to those kids into actually building up a relationship with the kids she might not have become their mom specifically but she would have had the possibility to become a parent or at least someone important in those kids lives.", "NTA. What about these kids, and being allowed to truly grieve for their mom?!!? These poor kids!! No way can you be the AH here, all you did was speak the truth. If Katherine wanted to be a good \u201c mom\u201d, no demands would\u2019ve ever happened. She would\u2019ve encouraged the kids to properly grieve their mom, not try to be number one mother in their lives. Your brother and Katherine created this heartbreak by neglecting to care for the children\u2019s feelings FIRST.  They tried to force the relationship, it\u2019s no wonder the kids want nothing to do with her. They made the kids feel she was replacing their mother!", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nThis is awful, well done for being a outside voice for them kids. Your brother has no one to blame but himself.", "NTA. Why do people try to force relationships to happen? You can't *make* someone love you. Trying to do so is the one way of guaranteeing that it will never ever happen.\n\nPerhaps if the kids' needs had been respected and they'd been given time, the relationship might have grown on its own. No chance now.", "NTA - he denied his kids their grief, he denied them the chance to honour their mother and go to her grave on mother's Day. A very painful day if you can't go and see the grave or even put flowers on it. It must have seemed to the kids like their mum was being erased from history. The fact he the replaced her and tried to force the kids to replace her as well.is awful.\n\nHe's in fantasy land and needs his perspective changing. That's why his kids don't see him anymore. He refuses to see that he made a mistake.", "NTA\n\nHe asked, you answered.\n\nAnd your brother IS a terrible father in this particular situation. He should have accepted his children's feelings and opinions.\nGoing to court twice to force an adoption sounds sick!", "NTA where do these step parents get the idea of forcing the kids to see them as parents help any situation. It\u2019s just going to lead to a broken heart and resentful kids. It\u2019s like they write all these parenting books for nothing. \n\nMaybe your brother needs shock therapy or something because how is he so stubborn to not realize the damage they did to these kids. They could\u2019ve had somewhat friendly relationship with their stepmother. It could\u2019ve even grow to love, but he hindered that by being so pushy, ignoring the kids needs and taking them away from their families in favor of his wife. He put his wife above everything else just to end up with nothing else. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not feeling sympathy for them, he asked a question and you answered, he just didn\u2019t want to hear the truth, that he already knew. They were warned, instead of taking that warning seriously they chose to push even more. It is no one\u2019s fault but their own.", "NTA ironically, if they had gone at this empatheticly and slowly, a semblance of a mother/child relationship may have been possible but to go barreling in, demanding emotions that can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be forced was doomed to failure. He torpedoed his own relationship with his kids. They were very clear about what they needed and how they felt and they ignored them feeling like their wants were more important. Hope neither of them had dreams of being a grandparent, because I doubt they\u2019ll get access.", "If Katherine wanted to be a mother then they could have looked into fostering children and eventually adopting. They still can. There are quite a few adoption stories in my family and I wouldn\u2019t be around if people hadn\u2019t adopted. It breaks my heart when people don\u2019t see this option.", "NTA, a mother isn't instantly made, it's earned by being a mother.  Katherine could have had that chance, or never, but she took that away the moment they tried to force it.  Your brother is burying his head in the sand refusing to take responsibility for this.", "NTA but your brother and Katherine are very big ones.", "NTA. For all anyone knows they could have developed a positive relationship with her over the years if brother and wife hadn't insisted it had to be a mother/child one. Plenty of kids have great relationships with their stepparents. They could have fostered that and continued to remember their mother the way the kids wanted and everyone would probably be much happier now.", "NTA.  His kids told him how they felt all along, and he denied it.\n\n\"He told me that was not what happened\"  So, according to him, what did happen?  That's a lot of rejection by the kids from the get-go.  This is Dad-Katherine versus Kids, and I suspect the juiciest stories have yet to be told to outsiders.  Just pushing parenthood onto step-children, even with the heavy-handed tactics of adoption attempts and Mother's Day charades, seems to have earned massive retaliation as soon as his kids were old enough to vote.  So Dad, what about your second marriage fired up your kids to this level of hatred?  Why did you bar your kids from acknowledging their mother's family or even her grave?  If the overt acts were this bad, how much passive-aggressive crap did they have to grow up with?\n\nDad is crying in his beer over Katherine's broken heart and not over losing his children.  That says it all.", "You tell him you are sympathetic to Katherine and him, but it's not your decision and you don't have a stake.\n\nNTA because all you did is say what the kids say.  If there's a misunderstanding, it's between him and the kids, not you and your brother.\n\nNTA.", "Nta I\u2019m glad they cut contact, he allowed nothing but a life of chaos.", "What\u2019s really crazy is they probably would have been closer to her if they hadn\u2019t tried to force it.", "NTA Tell him he has a self serving memory because he knows that seeing himself as the victim is much easier than dealing with the truth. Tell him the most he can gain right now is sympathy points from relatives, doubling down that his kids were ungrateful brats is not going to lead to them feeling guilty and coming to him for reconciliation. They're happy with the choices they made and have no desire to see your brother again. It's only when your brother and his wife acknowledge that they made mistakes is when reconciliation will be on the table.", "NTA. You spoke the truth and your brother has lost his children probably forever due to his actions.  What they did to the children was actually mentally abusive as they tried to invalidate their feelings and erase their mother.  Your brother can have his happy life with his wife alone since he will never admit what he actually did to his children and they will never forgive him for invalidating their existance.", "Why wasn\u2019t being a step mother enough for Katherine? Like yes she may not biologically be a mother BUT she still could have cultivated a loving, civil relationship with the kids. They don\u2019t have to be adopted by her for them to love and accept her. Being a mother figure should have been enough. Yikes.", "NTA", "NTA. Well put.", "NTA.\n\nHe was so focused in making Katherine be the mother of her children that he forgot to be the father that his children needed.", "NTA sometimes people are too close to see, but when the kids make it plain as day it's something else.\n\nMy son's dad's didn't die, I just chose two loser's to breed with. My oldest son always saw his dad's side, they love him to death. My youngest unfortunately doesn't, they chose the abusive drunks side. Even then, when he was old enough I asked if he wanted to try to contact them. He said I had to have a good reason to get away and he trusted me.\n\nAll that to say him keeping them away from the people who most understood their pain and loss on mothers day really breaks my heart. They'll never get that back.", "Little kids can only break your heart if you fail to understand what\u2019s going on in theirs. \n\nHad your brother not been such a complete and utter AH to his own kids, mourning the loss of their mother, they may have come to some sort of loving relationship with his wife, whether or not they ever called her mom. \n\nIt\u2019s on him that they have gone NC. It\u2019s also on him that they feel so much antipathy for his wife. I hope he enjoys not having kids as an old man, and if they have kids of their own, not having grandkids. \n\nHe can spend his life blaming his children for his own actions. I\u2019m sure it will work out great for him.", "NTA. He asked for and you told him the truth.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife have some serious issues. I do hope that you and the rest of the family have taken the kids 'in'.", "NTA - Your brother sucks big time. What a horrible way to treat your children.", "NTA and Katherine may have wanted to be a mom but she had no right to dump her trauma on children.  They are not responsible to fix all the wrongs she feels she was given.  This is mental abuse.  The father doesn't deserve a relationship with his children.  Katherine should have gotten therapy.  He should have insisted.  He should have let his children grow up without having Katherine vomit her trauma all over them.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe kids lost their Mum, they don't want her replaced and that's what their father tried to do.", "NTA. He and Katherine got what they deserved, no kids and stuck with each other.", "NTA, you told him the truth, and he's only angry because it isn't what he wanted to hear, not because it's untruthful or unproductive for him to hear.\n\nThe irony is that maybe Katherine would have become their mother had they allowed the children to dictate the pace and nature of their relationship, and keep loving their actual mother while opening up to Katherine. But by ignoring the children's very clearly expressed feelings and telling them that Katherine was a substitute for their mother in some zero sum game, he forced them away from being able to slowly build a maternal relationship with Katherine.\n\nHis only way of ever hoping to improve his children's relationship with Katherine is to admit to what he did, without any attempt to keep shifting blame onto the children. And even then, there's no guarantee they will ever be able to put aside the way he tried to erase their mother in favour of Katherine. This situation is his doing.", "[removed]", "Nta all day.", "Can't force that shit def NTA, hes been told by them hundreds of times, the sad part is if he wouldn't have tried to force it, theres a chance it might have happened in time and now the relationship has pretty much been destroyed, he's gonna end up dying alone or with just her.", "NTA\n \nWhat's his version of events? Get him to write that out on paper.\n\nAnd then tell him to set it on fire, because his version of this doesn't matter even slightly if he ever wants a chance at rebuilding his relationship with his children.", "I would honestly send him this entire post in this sub and let him see from other people's outside perspectives that he did ruin his children's lives by pushing this woman on them when they didn't want a relationship. People always choose the other spouse over their kids when the other parent passes away this is such a common rear occurrence. The fact that people haven't opened their eyes to realize that maybe they should just be single for a while regardless of how hard it is. Keep their junk in their pants and focus on their children who actually need them instead of worrying about getting.  They're junk taken care of and that's the same thing for women too in those situations... I honestly hope he starts to hate himself. When they start to have kids and they keep low contact or no distance from him, and then it's gonna get to the point where he's gonna push his wife-to-be the Grandma. Even though they're never gonna see her, as a Grandma and then it's gonna completely spiral out of control. I feel like you need to show him this because he clearly is not gonna ever open his eyes the fact that nobody spoke up in defense of those kids. This entire time falls on you all too, because yall should have a stood up and said something you'll and not stay quiet. You all are at fault for that. Cause I can tell you from my side, I hate my family members who saw all of this going on when I was growing up and didn't stand up to my defense. That actually strained our relationships and I look at them differently now as a parent and I don't want anything to do with them, so you might need to rectify that with those kids as well. Not saying you're a bad person or you did anything wrong but the fact that nobody stood up for them makes me question all of you guys too", "NTA\nThose kids told him exactly how they felt, for years, and he didn't care. It's unfortunate she's unable to have biological children, but that doesn't mean you get to force yourself on someone else's. Especially after they experienced a great loss of their own mother.", "NTA and your brother is a very poor parent - and so is his wife. They treated those kids like they were dolls for her pleasure. Gross. I'm not surprised in the least that the kids want nothing to do with their father.", "NTA. You gave your brother an important reality check.\n\nI empathise with Katherine. I also would love nothing more than to be a mother, and it might not happen for myriad reasons. It is a very painful reality that not everybody understands, and I truly feel for her.\n\nHowever. Even I can see that this isn't about her. Whether Katherine/your brother like it or not, the kids' needs absolutely should have come first here, and they didn't. They basically tried to delete the kids' mother out of existence and replace her with the new model, so said new model could have the toys - I'm sorry, kids - she always wanted. Of course the kids would have been upset by that.\n\nWhat's kind of tragic for everybody involved is that this could have easily been avoided. If Katherine and your brother had approached the kids differently and said \"this is Katherine, and I am going out with her. I like her very much, and she would like to get to know you both better. However, she is not a replacement for your mother, and as far as we are both concerned, you kids and your wants/needs are our top priority,\" and then followed through and treated the kids as people in their own right, rather than as representative of an idea that Katherine had in her head, she could have fostered a really good, and possibly even parental, relationship with them.", "If they hadn't forced it down the kids throats I bet they would have come around naturally. \n\nBut it's hard to come around to thinking of another person as mom when your own mothers memory is being erased.", "NTA. The really sad thing here is that the kids could have had a decent relationship with her if they hadn't tried to force it. If they had just allowed it to happen organically it may have turned out exactly the way that they wanted. Equal chance it may not have but a hell of a lot better chance than the way that they went about it. Now those kids lost their father too.\n\nOne thing that they absolutely do need is to know that they are supported so make sure your family is keeping in touch with them and let them know that you're on their side. Your brother and Katherine have each other.", "NTA the problem with forcing is the parties involved always dig in their heels.  If they had just let things flow naturally things could be very different for everyone.", "NTA. These posts are always so frustrating to read because I do have a certain amount of sympathy for someone who acts as a parent but isn't granted the place of a parent. But the reality is if they didn't push it so much, they probably would have gotten closer to what they wanted. You can't force anyone to love you. Insisting that they do is just going to build resentment. If Katherine wanted to be a parent, she should have acted as a loving parent would, which is allowing the kids to have their own feelings about things and not pushing your own desires onto them.", "If you read, Reddit, you\u2019ll find many stories like this\u2026 A new stepmom wants to fill the void but the kids aren\u2019t interested but they keep forcing it. Then they\u2019re surprised that the kids want nothing to do with them", "This all sounds like a lot of trauma and grieving/healing that your brother hasn't dealt with, and instead, immediately rebounded to a new wife.  Even if he resented his first wife, there's no reason to try and replace her as the kids' mom, what a sad situation.", "NTA. The sad part is, if they hadn\u2019t pushed it, the kids may have developed a good relationship with her overtime. Maybe not as their mom, but accepted her as a parental role.", "NTA - so glad the kids are adults now and cut off all contact if they want to", "NTA. \n\nSounds like Katherine should have just worried about developing a relationship with the kids besides saying, \u201cSURPRISE I\u2019M YOUR MOM NOW.\u201d Especially since they were 6 and 7 not like 1 and 2 (it still would have been wrong).", "NTA -  Your brother is the asshole for putting a chick over his kids which should be the other way around. He and Katherine were blocked by his kids as a result! Then you told the truth and he tried to play victim and say that never happened... good for you and the kids for revealing your brothers true colors", "Yahhh, my dad remarried twice after he left us and he expected us to call his wives our mom. Fuck that noise. \n\nWe only have 1 mom and she died, bro. You can\u2019t force anything on anyone, he should be ashamed of himself.", "NTA.\n\nHe asked and you answered. With the truth; rather than fuel your brother's and Katherine's delusions. \n\nThe kids were of ages 6 and 7 when their mother died which means they were old enough to remember her very well. They were never given a chance to grieve their mother fully and were pushed a \"new mommy\" when they clearly didn't want one and weren't ready for that. That was cruel of your brother and of course the kids were going to cut contact with him the first chance they got. What else did he expect?\n\nAnd let me put this out here. Had Katherine been able to have biological kids, something tells me that she'd have played the role of evil stepmother. She just wanted to fill a void with these kids. Maybe she should have gotten a puppy or a kitten. Forcibly stealing a dead woman's children against their will is not the solution.

Your children will always stay close to you. And if she would have just respected their boundaries, they probably would have gotten close to her over time. Anyways. Just my opinion. But I am a firm believer that your wife comes before anybody else in your family. You chose her. She is your priority. You are to lead her, guide her, respect her, with love, not dictatorship. And in turn, when your children see you love loving their mom or a mother figure that is the greatest gift you can give your children.. they will respect you in the long run and therefore have a healthy example of what it is to love their own wives or husbands when they get married.

His son just turned 20 and his daughter is 18.  Denise died when the children were 6 and 7 years old. 18 months later my brother met Katherine, his second wife and they married after four months of knowing each other. Katherine was unable to have biological children and she always dreamed of being a mom and wanted to be a mom to my nephew and niece. My brother wanted this for her also. But the kids did not want to be Katherine's children. They did not want to call her mom or be adopted by her, they did not want her to be the sole focus of mother's day, etc.\n\nMy brother spent years trying to get the children to call Katherine mom. He and Katherine applied for her to adopt the kids and were rejected by the judge after she spoke to the children about what they wanted. They tried again and were denied by a different judge before making it to court.\n\nThings were always tense with my brother and his children. It was also tense with the rest of the family because some of us spoke up and asked him why he was pushing this on his children so much. He would say Katherine deserved to be a mom and deserved the respect for being a loving and nurturing mother to the kids.\n\nMother's Day from the first year they were married until last year was very toxic. My brother no longer allowed the kids to see their maternal relatives that day and they also didn't see any of us or visit the grave. He said the day in their family was for Katherine. He would make her breakfast and give her cards and gifts from the kids. Then the kids would tell her she didn't deserve to be celebrated for Mother's Day and she was nobody's mother. My brother didn't like it and Katherine would be upset at the reminder. The kids would also be quick to inform Katherine they never wrote in the cards. Because my brother always addressed them \"to mom\" and the kids never called her that.\n\nIn the last few months my brother has lost contact with his children. The last time they spoke to their dad, the kids told him they put Katherine's wants before them and they would never forgive him for that. They said he had no right to insist they be the children to fill the void for her when they already had a mom who they loved. My brother dismissed the idea entirely that he put Katherine before the kids like that. When I saw him for New Years at my parents house he was telling me about it and I told him the kids were right and he did put Katherine's wants before the kids. I said he made her want to be a mother the most important thing and tried to force the kids to comply and be her kids. He told me that was not what happened and I should be sympathetic to him and to Katherine who had her heart broken by the kids.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He chose to be cruel to his children.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Katherine placed herself into the mother position and insisted that only she be the focus. His kids remember their own mother and him trying to force a square peg into the round hole left by their mother caused the rift.", "NTA but it's clear that they are never going to admit fault in this situation. He alienated his own kids, consistently pushed them into a relationship they didn't want and were uncomfortable with, disregarded their own feelings, minimized their grief over their mom, etc etc etc... I mean, it's not shock to anyone that the kids don't want a relationship with them. But you pointing that out isn't going to get through. I would hold firm on no sympathy though. They created this situation when the kids were barely old enough to make decisions, and they are now reaping the consequences.", "NTA. He definitely put his and Katherine\u2019s desires above his grieving children. If I were you, I would go LC or NC with your brother and reach out to your niece and nephew. Your brother and his wife sound like monsters.", "NTA", "No, you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s shocking how selfish he has been. Keeping his new wife happy at the cost of his kids and their mental and emotional welfare. It\u2019s obscene what they (he and Katherine) did. After their mother died he only ever cared about his own happiness. Not his children, who lost their precious mother. Katherine is not their mother. She\u2019s not even a stepmother. And he made sure that she never would be, by trying to force her on his children. Now they\u2019ve lost both of their parents. He should be deeply ashamed of himself.", "NTA. The way I see it, he definitely put Katherine's wants before his kids. If he didn't want his kids to cut him out of his life, then he shouldn't have forced them to have a relationship that they didn't want to have with her. With how quickly he rebounded and remarried, I understand why the kids felt like their bio mom was being replaced. I, too, would have no interest in having contact with anyone who forced me to have a relationship with someone when I didn't want to.", "NTA\n\nYou were right to say what you did. He seems utterly blind to what his kids wanted and had absolutely no respect for them, with trying to forge a bond they didn't want. \n\nWhy couldn't he and Katherine adopt a baby? She could've been a mother that way and forged a genuine bond. She should have respected the fact that these children lost their mother and didn't want to replace her. They chose not to call her \"mom\" and she should have accepted that, as should their dad.", "NTA. My dad got remarried and put her kids before my brother and I. It still sticks to me to this day. I wish my dad would have been more present, would have saved me from having a bunch of trauma.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother's mistake was not understanding that you can not force people into his kids' lives. The role of a parent is earned, not because of marriage or blood. Your brother and Katherine only saw what they wanted to happen but didn't allow the kids to process anything or let the kids get to know Katherine without being forced to.", "NTA at all! You can't force children to accept a step-parent. The fact that the first judge said no so he found another judge hoping for a different outcome? Delusional! My dad died when I was 4 and my mom got remarried very quickly (less than a year). My step dad adopted me and my brother. I was too young to really know what's going on but it caused a lot of issues between us/mom/bio dad's family over the years. \n\nI'm on some singles F B groups and there's a woman (easily in her late 40s/early 50s) who has been posting for years that she wants a man who is widowed with little kids or someone open to adopting.

You told your brother the truth. If he had been more sympathetic to his children, they might actually have developed a decent relationship with his wife. She would never have replaced their actual mother, but she might have been loved for herself. Instead, I imagine he\u2019s totally lost his kids.", "NTA. Stepmother here and the adult\u2019s behavior forcing her on them made me ill. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get that right bc she wants it.

He sounds like still living in delusion, especially since children have now gone no-contact with him. Katherine seems more level headed and reasonable than him to be honest.\n\nI myself took about 1.5 year to call dad, well, dad back when mom was dating him, and neither of them forced the issue.\n\nWritten on mobile, sorry for typos.", "In no way are you an AH. Katherine is however and your brother even more so because it is his fault in every way. And the fact that he kept his children from seeing their maternal side all but proves it. They both deserve exactly what they get. NTA", "NTA and this is from someone with a stepdad. My mom and stepdad let my relationship with stepdad grow organically. Like your niece and nephew, my dad died when I was little. My mom's first priority was me and making sure that any person that might be a potential stepdad for me would get along well with me and me with them. Your brother didn't even do that; I don't blame his kids for not wanting to talk to him and his new wife.", "NTA\n\nThe kids very likely would have changed their perception of her over time if they hadn't been pushed to call her mom, or try to force adoption.

His adult children\u2019s reactions speak for themselves.", "NTA. It's very sad what has happened and it is all your brother and Katherine's making. If they had honoured the kids' mother and allowed the relationship to build organically, this may not have happened. By being so pushy and forcing herself on them, she pushed them away completely. I would have said something to him the first Mother's Day and every one thereafter, and any time he mentioned the adoption, etc.", "NTA\n\nSad thing is, if they had respected the kids wishes and not focused so hard on Katherine\u2019s desire to be a mom the kids might have grown to see her a a mother figure. My kids bio dad is not in their life currently. Within 3 months of me marrying my second husband they were calling him dad by choice. I let them know it was an option and that they didn\u2019t have to. He never pushed it and followed my lead. \n\nYour brother going to have to live with the fact that his kids don\u2019t want him in their lives for a long time because he wouldn\u2019t entertain the idea of the possibility that he was wrong and that he messed up. It\u2019s his own fault.", "NTA.   You told him the truth and often, the truth hurts.", "NTA.  Your right.  Katherine needed to just be good to the kids and treat them well and have no expectations or try to replace their mom.  Had she done that they might have wanted her to adopt them but instead they tried to force it and now they probably hate her for taking their dad alway.  They lost their mom and dad.  Your brother is whipped and has transferred his sadness over his late wife onto Katherine\u2019s fertility issues and has done it at his kids expense.  Now that his kids are of age, be sure to give them a loving family they can count on", "Nta he needed to hear it. Even though he probably won't ever listen. \nThose kids deserved better. I'm glad they stood up for themselves and now they get to spend time with the family that did show them unconditional love. I'm glad you and your family stood by these kids as best you could.", "NTA. You were right and he needs to know. Forcing a relationship on children was never going to make one happen.", "NTA.

So it's not all that uncommon either", "I personally don\u2019t believe you would be, like you said it\u2019s their day and they just don\u2019t want drama, if they were also friends with your boyfriend (from the story it doesn\u2019t sound like they are, just by association) than it would be a different story. But I genuinely believe you\u2019re being mature and just want them to have a good day.", "NTA. Turns out you can\u2019t just swap out an entire mother.", "They should have all been in counseling.  Dad, kids and stepmom.  So sad!", "WTF does your brother want? Insisting that he's right won't change anything, so he should at least try some self reflection. Instead, he does the same thing over and over, expecting a different result while watching the situation become worse and worse.\n\nAs for Katherine, what's her deal? She went into this marriage expecting to get the kids. Instead got rejected over and over... So why did she stay married? From her own POV, this marriage was one big disappointment. Why did she stay? I'm trying to understand her own logic, but I can't.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA.  He needs to hear the truth, again and again, but it probably won't matter now anyway.  Odds are, his kids will never forgive him for trying to erase their mother from their lives.\n\nThe irony is, if he hadn't tried to force them to accept a new mom, maybe the kids would have come to see his new wife as a friend, and slowly she might have been able to provide a level of 'motherhood' to them that can naturally occur in such situations.  Instead, he kept poisoning the well.  He better hope he dies young and never needs their support, cuz I suspect he may never see them again.", "NTA. Your brother and Katherine suck. You know what is the sad thing to me....is if they hadn't pushed the kids like that and let the relationships occur naturally they probably wouldn't be in this situation. Now....

He was so focused on his new wife that he lost his kids.", "NTA. You were 100% right. It\u2019s as if they tried to erase their real Mum. If Katherine cared about their well being, she would have respected their boundaries. And so would your brother.

It\u2019s true.\n\nI feel sad because Katherine seems to be a good person and, maybe, if they didn\u2019t push it so much so soon, the kids could have eventually had her like a mother to them - not their adoptive mother, but a mother figure growing up. \n\nThey were so involved in their own needs and desires that they pushed the kids away.", "NTA Someone should have told your brother that if he and Katherine wanted children for her they could have adopted some. There are so many kids out there who need good homes. \n\nInstead, he tried to erase his children's mother from existence and force them to call another woman mom.\n\nIf I were his kids I'd never speak to him again.

Since it was forced on them, not on their terms or timeline and therefore negative and creating resentment they were never able to create a bond or relationship.

We had a man, who eventually became our stepfather, come into our lives about a year after my parent's divorce. He told us right away that he loved and respected our mom, that he would always be good to her and take care of her and that he also was there to help us if we ever wanted or needed his help with anything. He told us that he wasn't there to replace or compete with our dad and he simply hoped that as we got to know each other better that we would become closer and develop whatever type of relationship we were comfortable with.

Most normal people take about 4 months of dating to think about calling someone their significant other, and you believe these kids should respect her as their whole new parent and call her mom after the same amount of time? (Actually, now that I think about it, they probably knew her even less time...4 months is how long the *dad* knew her before marrying her...and that's disgusting behavior on the dad's part, that's not even enough time to know if someone will be safe for your kids to be around, much less to bring someone new into their home) Sorry not sorry, that's insane. \n\nAt any rate, Katherine has been their stepmom for about 10 years, NOT 15, and she and dad have been trying to force them to accept her, a woman the kids knew at most for four months, as their new mother for all of that time rather than trying to let it happen organically.

Weirdly their birthdays were only a day apart - he never had a problem with mom taking me to see my father's grave and lay flowers or talking about him. So I did grow closer to him, unlike OP's situation. \n\nWith OP they pushed to fast, too soon and tried to stop the grief.

Also, these kids lost a parent so they're not your typical 6 and 7-year-Olds.", "It is absolutely not too young to feel that way...", "Have you ever even talked to a 6 or 7 year old? They may not have the emotional maturity and understanding of an adult, but they're more than capable of having their own feelings and opinions and wishes. Didn't you ever have your feelings, opinions, or wishes dismissed when you were young because you were 'just a kid'? I certainly did at many ages, and I vividly remember how it made me feel so invalidated and ignored. I also distinctly remember how I felt about my own mother at about age 4, and that feeling never really changed because she never made any changes for the better in herself or with how she treated me.\n\nAlso, the person you replied to had the facts a little wrong: the kids were 6 and 7 when their mother died, and were more like 8 or 9 when their dad met the new woman and married her a shockingly short 4 months later. They were old enough to remember their mother before she passed and hopefully had each other to lean on and share memories of her, and that loss likely made both kids grow up a little faster than most. When the new woman arrived, they were more than old enough to know how they felt and what they wanted from her, which was nothing.\n\nWe also don't have any information about how dad treated the kids in that 18 months ( I haven't dug to see if OP said anything more in comments), or how the kids were allowed to grieve or remember their mother, if at all. All we know is that as soon as this new woman came onto the scene, dad immediately started pushing her as their new mom, cut the kids off from their mom's side of their own family, all but erased their mother from their lives, and actively disregarded the feelings and wishes of his own children at every turn. Even if the kids hadn't been as old as they were when this all started, they were well within their rights and abilities to resent how they were treated by both their father and this strange woman being foisted on them.", "Kids that age can absolutely have such stubborn feelings. \n\nI was 6/7 when my mom uprooted my life and moved me away from my school and my friends. I was miserable and bullied in the new village. I held a grudge and resented her for moving me there for near on *twenty years*. I have thrown that shit in her face as a grown adult. \n\nHell, I was actually younger than this the first time I asked why I didn't have a family like everyone else at school did - no grandparents, and very rare contact with aunts and uncles. I was maybe four or five? She gave me an age-appropriate explanation that her parents were horrifically abusive, and her siblings were all encouraged to bully each other as kids, so they were still nasty to her (and each other) as adults. I decided on the spot that I would have nothing to do with them or my cousins until my mom received an apology. I am now 28, she has still not received that apology, and I have never seen or spoken a word to any of my extended family since that day. \n\nKids are *stubborn*, especially if you're harming a beloved parent. Their dad was trying to erase their mom's memory, precious to them, and sticky-tape some random woman he'd known a matter of months into her place.

We're talking about OP's version of events, as told secondhand from a decade ago through an 8 year old. And they *were* adopted, just not by the first judge. As far as the actual adoption process, no judge in the world is going to look at a single bio dad with a stable job who loves their kids that wants to add mom to the adoption process and say \"no\" because an 8 year old doesn't want it. \n\nLittle kids don't get to say no to adoption. That's not how it works. The judge looks at the circumstances and decides. This is a clear cut best case scenario for the kids - living in a stable house with sole living bio parent and loving stepmom? Two incomes? Yea, judge isn't gonna say no.\n\n>And the dad absolutely DID try to force them to call her mom, did you miss the part where he wrote 'to mom' on Mother's Day cards, even though he knew they did not call her mom??\n\nI didn't miss this.

Then proceed to *surprised Pikachu face* when they get pushback from the children.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nAbsolutely  sad what it's happening  to these kids like if losing  the mother was not hard  enough then their own father pushing / rushing  things with \" a new mom\"?\nThat new couple is thinking  backwards!\n\nDad needs to understand  that his children  doesn't  need a replacement  for the late mother. \n\nKatherine  needs to face the fact that she is not their mother and she lost a (maybe) good chance to be a decent person to these kids.\n\nFinally, feel very sorry for the children.  They need support  and love. Not a  impose mom replacement!", "NTA your brother is a monster for what he did to his kids.", "NTA. You are only the Ah for not telling this all sooner.", "NTA.  Maybe if your brother didn't force things, his kids would have grown to care about their stepmother.", "NGL, telling her she was nobodies mother is fucking rough when she is infertile... They were totally, righteously, angry and I'd never hold it against them, but God damn, that is a fucking brutal tactical strike on her.\n\nAnyway NTA, not OP, not the kids.\n\nI do wonder how much of this was step mom and how much was overbearing dad trying to \"fix\" it but it saddens me, because most of her dream was still very much achievable if they had just been understanding and showed a little of that unconditional love that is supposed to define parenthood.", "I feel sorry for her, but it is all your brother's fault. That relationship would naturally develop or not, but your brothers forcing of it led them to resent her for a desire she can't control that she can never achieve on her own. She had a chance at that, but your brother fucked it up and in the process ruined his and her relationship with his kids.", "INFO\n\n6 and 7 seems pretty young to be so dead set against a new person stepping in as a mother figure. My mom died when I was 18 and my sister was 8 and she has almost no recollection of our mother despite being doted on up until she died. So I have to wonder what's going on here that a 6 year old and a 7 year old seemingly hate their step-mother? That's not normal for children that young.", "Sad and pathetic situation.  We hear this again and again.  Seems like there's an entire generation that refuses to face reality and move on with their lives.  The real tragedy is that these children are throwing away their own happiness by refusing to accept a new parent in their lives when the biological one is gone.  Of course it's different if the step has been cruel to them, but seems like a good thing when someone comes into your life that just wants to love you.  And all these people just reject it in favor of a fantasy world.", "Ymba\n\nNot enough context here.  It sounds like she sincerely wanted to love these children and they acted a bit bratty... though I have a feeling there's more to this relationship that you haven't let on.", "YTA (sort of).  Wish I could use a less severe term than A because I think A is too much here.  I***M***HO (emphasis on ***M***) ...\n\nSpouse (any spouse) comes before children.  This is hard enough when a family is not blended, 100x more so when blended.  But it still holds.  Which is why blending a family, especially with minor children, should be done a lot slower.  Every relationship is different, but 18 months probably isn't long enough to make that evaluation.  Because ... 18 months isn't really 18, it's 18 minus the mourning and pulling-himself-back-together time.\n\nBrother and (I think) Katherine are A's because they forced it on the minor children rather than give them mourning space.  If a kid wants to be adopted by a new mom, they'll make it known.  Katherine should understand that, even though she wants kids so bad.  If she wanted to be an instant mom, perhaps a blended family was not her best choice.\n\nAnd now they are paying the price as the kids enter majority.  Maybe they'll come around but it won't be easy.", "That cool and all, but this sub is literally inundated with kids that hate their step parents and admit they have 0 reason for it.", "... what chaos? they didnt like the women but nothign here hints at an unstable home life", "It doesn't matter. She tried to make herself be called mom. Both bro and Katherine decided they would try to force the issue. It doesn't matter if she steps into a parental role. It doesn't make her mom if the kids don't view her as mom. They could have settled with stepmom and accepted boundaries the kids put up.", "She tried to steal a dead woman's children. She didn't want to be a step mom, she wanted to be MOM - full stop. She tried to erase the mother of these children. And their father thought that was a grand idea They said they didn't want their mother erased and were punished for it by losing even more of their mother.", "NTA\n\nBut one question. Why did they not consider other means? Such as adoption or surrogacy? Why insist on it being his kids being forced? I get that Katherine is sad that she couldn't give birth to a child of her own, for whatever reason, but it's genuinely horrendous that your niece and nephew were forced into isolation, and deliberately alienated from their Maternal family. It's no wonder that the kids have gone no contact. Hopefully you still get to keep contact with them. Your brother asked you, he got an answer. It's not your fault he didn't like it.

Either way NTA,my god ...", "She may have wanted to be a mother, but her selfishness shows she would not have been a good one. She put her desire to fulfill her personal fantasy over the wants and needs of the actual children.

It's fine. We are adults who can handle the repercussions. \n\nI like one step brother but not the other. Never had an issue with my stepdad. \n\nBut I do think it makes sense when you have a strong relationship with the bio parent and the step parent wants to take over that a child would feel some sense of loyalty to their bio parent. Maybe even guilt at cultivating a relationship. That shit can get into the psyche pretty deep.", "I appreciate my grandfather so much already, but way more after reading these stories.

He never moved on because she was the love of his life and he didn\u2019t want anyone else.

There's no new woman on the horizon for him.  There was an argument when some of the kids wanted to stop going, he was upset but he ended up giving way.  But he still goes.
