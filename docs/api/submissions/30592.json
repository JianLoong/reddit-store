If there\u2019s an issue there it may help y\u2019all out a lot. And it would also be hilarious if you ridiculed them for being rude to someone who needed more salt because they have a condition. Your family sounds toxic. I glad to hear that you are being a supportive partner to her through this. Once you have the kid family members like to act up(esp females which I find so weird).

Stand up for her now or they'll try to run your whole life.", "I would hope that her blood pressure is ok, I know some people have to add sugar in excess to coffee etc, cereal, when they don't feel well and go to the dr the dr asks for blood work\n\nIf it comes back high you might be diabetic, \n\nSame with salt, is gf lacking in some thing that she is wanting salt in excess?\n\nSome people are on meds they don't need to be on, but due to poor eating habits, \n\nThey are on them same with other vices", "Hopping on this to add: my partner just learned they have POTS which makes you crave more salt. They will literally just eat salt sometimes.", "POTS is also something that increases salt cravings!", "I totally agree, definitely NTA. I love to cook and I love to host but I don\u2019t care what someone adds to what I serve. The only thing I care about is did they enjoy what they ate. To me, cooking for others is an act of love. People enjoy their food in a myriad of ways and my level of seasoning may not match someone else\u2019s. This is not an affront to me as the cook. Also Immy is pregnant, let her eat her food the way she wants. Seems like OPs sister shouldn\u2019t host if she is this easily offended.", "eh tbh it\u2019s kinda rude to reseason food someone else made you", "This is misinformation. An ungodly amount of salt is necessary to my health , actually.", "Yeah but has she told her doctor how much salt she eats? There are things that could cause you to crave salt that you\u2019re not gonna notice on those tests.", "While it is weird to say she can't apologize, doing so won't really solve anything. Even if she apologizes this same issue will just happen again the next time they eat together. Unless the plan is to apologize after every meal this needs to be dealt with.", "So in your mind someone using a lot of salt at a business dinner will have repercussions on someone career? If you're not prepared to have people use condiments on your food your shouldn't be cooking for people.", "Same for me. I\u2019m a salt fanatic with low blood pressure and low sodium levels so my cardiologist gives me the go ahead to add salt and / or soy sauce when I crave.", "I asked for ranch one time at my husbands friends house, and he proceeded to swear, scream, and insult me for not liking ketchup and \u201cinsulting his cooking.\u201d It\u2019s really not that deep, the person just knows how they like food. Reacting that way to a seasoning choice is a red flag", "Are you a dietitian or cardiologist ?", "I have POTS, so if I\u2019m not drinking my electrolytes and eating salty snacks, I know it\u2019ll be a bad day", "I used to get small salt licks for joke gifts. Jokes on them I used a least half. \n\nI often get praised on my blood pressure, which is weird because I have major anxiety. \n\nI am a asshole though I don't taste I salt. The onetime I had too much salt in a dish was my first baking attempt at 13. I mixed up sugar and salt.", "See, I don't get that when it comes to the level of spicy. It doesn't have anything to do with whether it's seasoned properly. Just because I like things extremely spicy to the point that 99.9% wouldn't be able to handle it, I'm rude? That sounds like a them problem.", "agree to disagree ? id never invite someone back over if they had the nerve to reseason a meal i worked hard on", "Good lord people, the OP himself said:\n\n>\u2026as usual Immy tried the meal and added an ***unhealthy amount of salt***.\n\nWhat are you all on about? Eating an unhealthy amount, an \"ungodly\" amount, is really unhealthy! Like a ten second google search will show you this. The OP knows this and states this.\n\nYall are being super weird here!", "Potatoes are higher on potassium than bananas (twice as much per serving)", "For asking for ranch to pair with a burger instead of the ketchup offered? You do you, but I was recovering from anorexia at the time and anybody that tries to control what I eat is an extreme AH", "I add an ungodly amount of salt to my food as per the recommendation of my cardiologist. Other people may view it as unhealthy, but it\u2019s not their business.", "Yup, have to rinse it off or it feels like it's scouring your skin.. leaves salt rings on darker clothing when you sweat.", "May I recommend searching for Salty plums?\n\nChinese grocery should sell them. They are plums dried in salt. mmmmmm.\n\nAlternately, Dutch salted liquorice is also delicious.", "Real licorice has glycyrrhizic acid, it can cause high blood pressure and deplete electrolytes - can result in arrhythmias and even heart attack.\n\nLarge amounts daily is not usually a good idea.\n\nI love it.  But I buy the salty kind since it\u2019s my favorite, and it\u2019s pretty difficult for me to willingly eat too much of that at once!  My tongue would give up well before my heart.", "Yeah, hydration is absolutely an issue today with the amount of people who just like, don\u2019t drink water. Soda and coffee and wine are not replacements for water people!!!! Hydrate!!", "Can confirm, I always guzzle water after a good fried chicken sandwich. It\u2019s part of the experience, really.", "the post.. is not about you. i\u2019m literally not talking about you. i\u2019m sorry you went through that but at the end of the day unless that person knows that you can\u2019t expect them to not be offended by you changing their cookin. i\u2019m talking about op girlfriend not you. burger toppings is not the same. it\u2019s someone\u2019s house not a restaurant, that woman could have just eaten it instead of being an ass", "Yup, I have this and my doctor told me to make sure and add more salt to my diet. Easy!", "I like the pickle brine from real fermented dills \ud83e\udd17", "I definitely have licked the dirty one in the field for cows, so I feel this \ud83d\ude02", "I had the good luck of having a very thorough and determined GP who also happened to be married to an Endocrinologist. I look back at some of the gym classes I went to before I got too sick, and remember beating myself up for not being able to put the effort in!", "Sorry, I meant to tell you explicitly that you could apply that lesson to other people and situations! Some people have preferences and it\u2019s really not that deep, it\u2019s not an insult and the gf was literally just trying to enjoy her food how she always does", "An actual, educated, doctor would only agree with you on a case by case basis after having all the facts.\n\nYou\u2019re saying something is *inherently unhealthy*, that\u2019s actually false. You lack enough facts within the specific context and are assuming that the person you\u2019re talking is *not actually communicating with their doctor* or that *their doctor is incompetent*, or that *they aren\u2019t seeing a doctor at all*, or that *they are ignoring their doctor\u2019s advice*. \n\nYou are definitely assuming something in order to make the statement that something is inherently unhealthy; and that this particular person shouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nI\u2019m actually studying nutrition and\u2026extra salt on pizza is not inherently unhealthy. It can certainly be extremely unhealthy, but that does depend on the individual. There\u2019s far more to the spectrum of diet and health than you seem to be willing to believe. \n\nI would personally say that it tends to be unhealthy on average and that I hope she\u2019s discussing her dietary habits with a doctor and dietician. If her habits help her sustain good health though, then the habits are fine. There is a good chance she may have to change the habits eventually as well. Maybe it\u2019s fine now, but won\u2019t be a year from now.\n\nHealth is a spectrum. Mental health is important to it. Enjoyment of food does impact health. There\u2019s a balance. Calling food \u201cinherently unhealthy\u201d doesn\u2019t convey the reality of that balance most of the time.", "I would take beer salt and pink Himalayan salt and just eat/suck on it by itself for a long time.
