Which you clarify in a later comment you agreed to an open marriage so long as he doesn't tell you about the women.\nSo you must know there is potential for any number of kids out there. If you didn't want to know about the sex then why are you wanting to get involved with consequences. \nHe did his part and respected not involving you, why didn't you respect his wishes", "NTA\n\nFunny how you are the one being accused of \"betraying\" your partner", "YTA. You were allowing your husband to have extramarital affairs, and made clear that those were his business and his, alone. He is an adult, and he gets to choose how he handles himself. If there was a question of paternity, it was the responsibility of the woman he slept with to get a paternity test ordered, or for him to decide to provide her with a DNA sample. This has nothing to do with you, and as you stated, you wanted no part in his extramarital activities. Providing her with your daughter's DNA was a gross betrayal, and an absolute AH thing to get your daughter involved in.", "??? Was he sleeping with this woman's sister when you were married or was this before you got together?  If it was before, YTA.  It wasn't your concern and you should have dropped it.  If it was during your marriage/relationship, why are you with him?", "NTA, for starters he cheated.  He broke the foundation necessary for trust. He doesn't get to be mad at you for not trusting him.\n\nAnd secondly, the only kind of men who refuse to establish paternity are men that don't want to be verified as the father.\n\nHe got lucky that he wasn't the kids father.  He didn't KNOW he wasn't the kids father.  The only way for him to know that information for sure, is to establish paternity and do the test.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you drugged him and took a DNA sample while he was sleeping. You DNA-tested your own child, which you had every right to do.\n\nI can't for the life of me see why they're saying you \"betrayed\" him. At most, you demonstrated you didn't fully *trust* him. But any man capable of reproducing who has sex with a woman, then denies there's *any* possibility that a child conceived (during that timeframe) could be his, doesn't appear to have his facts straight.\n\nAnd if he was sleeping with her when he was married to you, well, he's just deflecting.", "I am sometimes amused how open minded americans are! Like you wanted to know if there were any half siblings!! I would never wanted to know \ud83e\udd10", "NTA but what the fuck (literally)?", "NTA- You are being gaslit if you think IN ANY WAY that you are at fault here..  this man is a liar, he doesn't respect you and IMO you need to get the kids and get away from that man.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to cheat and possibly father a child, and then cry crocodile tears over trust.", "NTA - he had a potential child. Him ignoring it does not change that fact at all. And your reasoning isn't that you needed to know if it was your husband you wanted to make sure your children knew if they had a sibling, they have as much right to know as your husband.", "NTA - he admitted to sleeping with the sister which means it\u2019s a POSSIBILITY. The only betrayal is him to you. You did the right thing by checking.", "YTA he has every right to be upset with you. You don\u2019t trust him at all. He now has to live with the fact that his wife betrayed his trust", "NTA\nHe slept with someone else and somehow is your fault for being considerate with his possible child? NTA at all.", "Pretty fucking big info:\n\nWas he married to you at the time of the sleeping with the sister?", "NTA if he was so sure it wasn\u2019t his son why didn\u2019t he get the test done to put your mind at ease? Sounds like there was a possibility in his mind the test wouldn\u2019t go his way so he wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nYou have every right to want to know if your children potentially have other siblings and you didn\u2019t force him to do anything you just checked for your children\u2019s sakes.", "NTA. It is totally reasonable to want to know whether your husband has another child with a different person, especially if that child's parent is getting in touch with you about this very thing. Your husband saying \"No I never took a test but she's not mine, just forget about it\" is absolutely not an appropriate response to this situation.", "NTA but why are you staying with a cheater that consistently lied to you? Sounds like you have bigger problems", "You guys are definitely a smelly and weird family.", "NTA\n\n\"trust me, i slept with this other woman, but I'm sure that kid is not mine. Zero percent chance\"?\n\n(I'm not implying he cheated, likely before op and him got together) but if you have sex with someone, the chance is never zero. Hell, maybe that other woman could be crazy and saved his sperm from the condom and impregnanted herself weeks/months later. Who knows. Plus at some point, the woman may come after your husband and have a court order test or something.", "Info: Did your husband cheat on you, or did he sleep with this other woman before he met you?", "Nta, you have every right to find out on your daughter's behalf if she has a brother, sounds like your husband is trying to take the attention away from what I'm assuming was an affair if this other child is only a baby.", "YTA", "NTA. I would say YTA if you had tested his DNA without his consent. You were put in between a rock and a hard place by your husband, and your daughter has the right to know if she has siblings.

That's rich.", "NTA. There's never a guarantee that sleeping with someone doesn't result in a pregnancy and his refusal was very suspicious, all he had to do was take the test.", "Nta he cheated n they r blaming u? Ok Nta n rethink ur relationship with that guy n his family", "NTA.  He didn\u2019t want to take the test because he was worried he was the father and didn\u2019t want to pay child support.", "Nta. You were doing the right thing by both children. Your husband has clearly been asked about this by that woman and has done nothing. That\u2019s why she contacted you.

No cheating involved", "OP never said her husband cheated, they could have slept together well before OP and her husband got married.", "He lied and cheated and slept with someone else. How is the OP the asshole in this scenario?", "She is right not to trust him. If he can lie and cheat, denying his child would be no problem. OP is NTA. Better to be sure now. In fact the husband should  have gotten one immediately to give them all a piece of mind.", "Trust? He admittedly slept with this woman. But trust me I\u2019m not the father\u201d. He never took a DNA test\u2026.would you take your husbands word for it?  If he cheated her betraying HIS trust is laughable. But trust is not the real issue here. It\u2019s whether he has a kid he\u2019s not help taking care of. Who cares about feelings when paternity is in question. He\u2019s not the father so now there\u2019s no threat of child support and court which affects the family. He should be relieved.", "This. Every one seems to ignore that part.
