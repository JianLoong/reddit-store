I commented this to my doctors and they told me to go again since probably my brain associates the place we live right now with my depression an apathy for life, so this time I want to go two days, see the sunset on the beach with my girls and go eat icecream by the sea.\n\nMy husband dissaproves. He says he wants to go only one day since that is already too much for him.

He says he doesn't like to walk with me while shoping and jumping stores and going downtown or to the mall, and since he already is going tomorrow I should either buy those things at the beach (much more expensive and I don't know where the stores are there) or we should only go one day.\n\nI think I'm in the right, he thinks he's in the right, so AITA f0or wanting to go to the beach?", "created_utc": 1667606141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymegcq/aita_for_wanting_to_go_to_the_beach/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't like the beach and you do.  You offered to take the girls by themselves and he can stay home.  \n\nIf he doesn't like that he can suck it up and put on his big boy pants and come to the beach.\n\nThe whole shopping thing? You should just go without him. I would not take my husband on those kinds of errands just for the reasons he stated. Go yourself and shop. Problem solved.\n\nHave fun at the beach and leave sourpuss home lol.", "NTA. Life should be enjoyed. He's not coming up with other options for enrichment. He's just standing in the way. Anxiety or not, he either engages with you and you finding joy in life or he doesn't. Right now, it sounds like he's only trying to make you being able to get out and make memories difficult. Make it clear that you're not okay with staying home because you are working on your mental health. If he chooses to not help you, that's his choice, but he doesn't get to dictate that you sit miserable in the house.", "NTA. If going to the beach is something that's going to be good for you, then, by all means, you should go. If he doesn't want to go, he doesn't have to, but he doesn't get to use his anxiety as an excuse to dictate whether or not you do. Conversely, if there are things you need to get for the trip and he doesn't want to drive you, then you need to drive yourself or find another way to get to the store to get the things you need. If he doesn't want to be alone while you're out on the trip, then he's more than welcome to call up friends or family to come hang out with him while you're gone. It's really not that difficult of a situation to work out.", "NTA, but your husband is one.  Is he an adult or a child?  He doesn\u2019t need you by his side every minute, and I find it alarming that he knows a simple thing helps your mental health, but he\u2019d rather deprive you of it than to grow the fuck up and stay home alone so you can go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
