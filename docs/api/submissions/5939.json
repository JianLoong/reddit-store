It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't.\n\n\nWhen we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.\n\n\n\nNow he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.\n\n\nETA to clear few points:\n\n\n* For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.\n\n\n* I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.\n\n\n* I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes.

I went to a Christmas dinner with my mom's family. There was nothing I wanted, so I just socialized and ate when I got home. Why should she have to make a whole new dish just for you? That is pretty entitled behavior.", "YTA. Holy entitled. Pretty sure you don't need to address her as FMIL. You'll be single soon enough.", "How many variations of this story do you plan to post? \n\nBefore the holiday, you posted after being told they weren\u2019t going to make a different meal and how you thought it was nuts as you\u2019re a guest. \n\nEveryone told you then to bring your own food. \n\nAnd now you didn\u2019t and you made a scene. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You knew in advance that accommodations wouldn't be made, yet you still showed up and made a bunch of drama.", "Let me recap.\n\nYou DEMANDED some food was made to your liking, and when people told you \"no\", instead of cooking food for yourself... you caused a scene ?!\n\nYeah, YTA. If you have things you don't like to eat, it's YOUR problem. You are not a child anymore. Start acting like an adult.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nYour issues are just that: Yours. For you to place the responsibility for YOUR issues on others not only makes you an asshole, but a presumptuous one at that. \n\nYou were told several times BEFORE the event, that you needed to deal with your own issues. You decided to go, anyway. Good on you, for at least going. \n\nHowever, you allowed your pride to get in the way, by not taking care of your own issues. (Basically, you said to everyone \"Hey! They're putting this thing together. I don't care what they think, they WILL make me what I want\")\n\nIn making the evening about you, you ruined the evening for everyone. That makes you the asshole, here.", "YTA - they did offer to accommodate you, by allowing you to bring your own dish.", "YTA. You don't dictate what your host cooks. If you're that picky, you should have cooked for yourself. You sound awfully high maintenance.", "YTA. You were asked to accommodate yourself and you didn't b/c your a guest. Bullshit that is entitlement. I am Celiac I don't expect anyone to accommodate me and make sure I bring something safe to eat.", "If there's no medical reason for you not to eat it than you can bring your own food. Luckily you haven't tied the knot yet so your fiance can find a real grown up to marry. YTA", "You were told no accommodation would be made and you said you wouldn't bring your own food or show up then....but you still showed up empty handed knowing there would be no food for you. Then acted suprised that no accommodation was made and stormed out. Of course people are upset at the purposeful scene you made so that all the attention was on you. YTA", "YTA. Guests also have their duty, which is to accept what the hosts have made for dinner. Its an unspoken rule that if you are unwilling to go with what the hosts have made, you make and bring your own food. Totally fine to request something, but you need to keep in mind that you're asking people to make an entire new dish for you on top of all their other dishes, which is a lot of time and money spent. If they say no, at that point just bring your own dish. You are a guest, not their boss telling them they have to make something for you or you'll leave.", "YTA - Great job ruining any potential relationship with your in laws before even getting married! You behave worse than many children I know, they\u2019d at least just sit there and pick at something even if they didn\u2019t want it. It\u2019s ONE NIGHT and it\u2019s not your home. MIL has every right to cook whatever she wants as she is hosting and if you really are that picky, you should have brought something you could eat. Also have you never heard of a potluck?!? Like it\u2019s very common for guests to also bring dishes or something else for dinner.", ">She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish whrn I'm a guest then I better stay at home.\n\nWhat?! Why?! This alone makes you an AH.\n\n\n\n>When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made, I got up, go my things and walked out and went home.\n\nI can't believe you did that. Double AH.\n\n\n\n>Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.\n\nHe is correct. Apologize FFS. Why are you so painfully entitled? Who in your life has put up with this shit?\n\nMy God, YTA", "YTA. That is something you need to work on in therapy.", "YTA being a picky eater is not the same as having an allergy or being vegan when everyone else isn't. You had no right to even ask.", "YTA. If you are that picky you should bring your own food. Someone who is trying to make a holiday celebratory meal is already working very hard in a very short window of time. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve never had to prepare a big meal, or you\u2019d understand just how much work that is. Presenting her with a menu of alternate foods to prepare just for you, not for allergies or medical reasons but because you\u2019re picky\u2026.? That is the very definition of gall and selfishness.", "YTA. You should have brought your own dish.\n\nAnd I say that as somebody who has dozens of food intolerances that make me extremely ill.", "You: Make me something special. \n\nFMIL: No. You\u2019ll have to bring your own food. \n\nYou: *Doesn\u2019t bring any food for yourself.* Whaaaaa! There\u2019s nothing for me to eat here! \n\nYTA I would be so disappointed in my child if they brought home a partner like yourself.", "YTA. I just went through this with a picky eater. I did accommodate them and made plenty of vegan-friendly dishes. They still weren't satisfied, if you're that picky, bring your own dish. Problem solved.", "YTA bring your own food if it affects you that much.", "YTA: Holy moly, this is just bad!", "YTA\n\nYou were offered an accommodation. Bring what you wanted to eat. You just expected them to fix their meal around your wants and needs. You are selfish and spoiled.", "As someone who hosts a lot of dinners and people, I always try to be as accommodating to allergies dietary restrictions, etc.  However, most people make what they make and that's that - that's okay, too.   \n\n\nYTA here. You were invited to the \"first\" celebratory Christmas dinner with them and basically created an issue how she had to accommodate you because you're a \"guest\" prior to the event.  I get the feeling you have no idea how much work and preparations are made in advance for the holidays. After all, these aren't dietary restrictions you have due to physical health reasons, these are restrictions you've placed upon yourself.... I'm wondering if you hadn't come off as \"I'm your guest and you should accommodate me\" as you describe maybe she would have gone out of her way to make a special dish for you. In fact, after you pursued the issue, she told you that you could make your own and bring it. Then, when you got there you left in a huff when she didn't yield. You acted like a spoiled brat.", "YTA. \n\nShe told you she couldn't accommodate you, which makes sense, because hosting a holiday meal is already a lot of work. I am also a picky eater, so I make sure to bring at least one or two dishes that I can eat to every holiday meal. \n\nThey offered to feed you, and you didn't like the food that was offered. That's fine, but it's not up to them to accommodate picky guests. You were presented with a solution (bring your own food), which you ignored, and then caused a scene during a holiday meal.", "You are an a-hole.  You don't mention a medical condition or special diet out of necessity . . . just that you are a picky eater because of childhood.  When you approached the FMIL and \"showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate\" you she declined and asked you to bring your own dish.  That is where you should have stopped.  But you argued more and you ended the situation with \"knowing\" you were expected to bring your own dish . . . and that your fianc\u00e9 even agreed you should.\n\nSo, what makes you an a-hole is that you walked into your FMIL's home with full disclosure of what would happen, but then threw a hissy fit, because what you knew would happen, did.  This is the clearest case of purposeful sabotage for the sake of drama that I have ever seen.\n\nYou need to apologize to all involved, and now you will have to work extra hard to show that you are not an entitled, selfish, drama queen who apparently thrives off of conflict.  I cannot believe this is how you plan to interact with people that will be in your life forever, if that is how you view marriage.", "[removed]", "She did accommodate you, her accommodation was you bringing your own dish to eat. You clearly have no understanding of how stressful catering for a full Christmas meal is. \n\nYTA", "Yta you are being entitled and spoiled. If your fianc\u00e9 is smart he will run. There is nothing wrong with guest bring something to dinner. It\u2019s not your future mil job to wait on you.", "\"I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made\"\n\nAnd this is your choice to make. It would be kind of her to do this for you but it is also a big imposition seeing that she has the entire meal to make and now you're asking her to do extra work.\n\nYTA because you are expecting others to do what you should do for yourself, then you made a scene about it. Yikes. Red flag!", "The lack of self awareness... of course YTA", "YTA; as someone who is \u201cpicky\u201d because of my autism, you were invited to *join them* for dinner. They are under no obligation to make an entirely different meal because you won\u2019t even try theirs; they even gave you the option to bring your own. My cousin used to have her mom bring chicken nuggets and french fries to every family dinner when we were kids, you can do the same.", "YTA.  Stop being so demanding and entitled.", "YTA. Typically, in this situation it is good manners to bring your own food.", "YTA. You have aversions to certain food. That's your problem.\n\nGet help for it. \n\nAlternatively get used to cooking dishes for yourself to bring to group dinners/parties or get used to stomping off in a sulk because its gonna happen a lot.", "YTA. If you are that picky of an eater then it is up to you to bring your own dish. It appears it\u2019s not even an allergy or serious dietary restriction\u2026.just that you are picky. Your FMIL let you know ahead of time what she would be cooking and told you to bring your own dish if you wouldn\u2019t eat what was being served. None of that should have been a surprise to you. Honestly I think they went out of their way to accommodate you by allowing you to bring your own dish\u2026some people would be offended by that. It is not up to the host to accommodate every single guest\u2019s likes and dislikes\u2026that would be impossible. \n\nYou come across as very entitled and spoiled. Walking out and refusing to celebrate Christmas was WAY over the top. All that did was show your FMIL and your fianc\u00e9 that if you don\u2019t get your way you will throw a fit. I would be mortified if I treated my future in-laws that way!! If your fianc\u00e9 was my son I would be telling him to run.", "YTA You have absolutly no manners.", "Way to ensure your inlaws always dislike you. Don't be surprised when the wedding is called off...   \nYTA for being so self-centered. You are acting like this was a dinner in your honor, it was Christmas not your birthday.. \n\nIt's your responsibility to feed yourself when you are the ONLY guest that needs super specific accommodations and the host is already busting their ass to make a huge meal for other guests...", "YTA. You asked for accommodation, they said no and specified you need to bring what you can eat. You show up, empty handed, and, like they said, there was no food for you *insert surprised pikachu face*. They didn't blindside you by saying they'd cook something for you and didn't. They said they weren't and you're looking for an excuse to pick a fight.", "YTA - also, I\u2019m thinking fianc\u00e9 is going to rethink this whole thing with you.", "[removed]", "Of course YTA and entitled.", "YTA. Also, if your fiance is worth a salt, he would know to prioritize his family over you on this one.", "YTA your fiance and his family won't forget this lmao", "YTA here, when I was a vegetarian I brought my own meals or ate before hand. Family dinners isn't about the food. Very, very immature.", "YTA. Just save this story to share when you get dumped as to the reason why. You sound entitled and selfish.", "YTA\n\nYou are incredibly entitled and expect the world to revolve around you. It doesn't. Just because you're a picky eater doesn't mean the woman who spent hours, if not days, cooking for a huge holiday dinner needs to \"accommodate\" you. There should be plenty of options at a meal that size that you can eat. You just refuse and make demands, just because you're a picky eater, which is ridiculous.\n\nEvery year I bring a a couple dishes to my inlaws holiday meals, as that's what family does. Help with the cost, help with how much work it is to make so many dishes for a big spread like that. You can't find it in yourself to do the same? It's immature and selfish to say that just because you're the guest, the host should accommodate your picky needs. It's not a medical issue and you need to get over yourself.", "YTA. Your MIL is not your servant nor is she your personal chef. They were gracious to invite you for dinner. When you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s house, you eat what they make. It\u2019s not like you have a dietary restriction and are deathly allergic to a certain ingredient\u2026..you\u2019re literally just picky and unwilling to be flexible. It is YOU who should be making accommodations when you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home. You either bring your dish to contribute or grow up and put on some big girl pants and try some new foods.\n\nNow if it was an allergy thing, it\u2019s not unreasonable to mention that when it\u2019s a family member or a good friend. Hopefully you\u2019d have caring family/friends where they wouldn\u2019t want you to die so they\u2019d make something special for you. However, that\u2019s not the case here. And even if it was, you\u2019d still be the AH for your behavior. Good luck with marrying into that family because you totally made a horrible impression.", "Yta- I get being picky, but they allowed you to bring your own I get being a guest but if the event isn't about you, don't make it be. Also you're TA because you KNEW they weren't going to \"accommidate\" you and tou STILL went without your own dish", "YTA\n\nIt's one thing to inform them of your eating preferences and request an accommodation but you can't demand one. All made worse when you knew in advance. Why even come? Just to start drama? OP you're being pretty and entitled.\n\nNobody is required to accommodate your eating preferences, it should be appreciated but never expected.\n\nBring a dish or host yourself.", "INFO: what accommodations did you request and what options did you suggest?", "YTA\n\nTo make sure you have food you're able to eat, you should've brought your own dish like your MIL asked you to do. You refused to. She not once led you to believe that she'd make a special dish for you.", "[removed]", "Totally YTA. If you can\u2019t eat what the host provides, you bring your own dish.  She is not going to custom make a bunch of different foods to accommodate everyone.", "Yta. I have also spent my life being extremely picky and I have a ton of anxiety surrounding trying new foods. But I don\u2019t demand to be accommodated everywhere I go and I don\u2019t demand that someone who\u2019s hosting me for dinner make different food for me. You could\u2019ve attempted to eat what your fianc\u00e9s family made, you could\u2019ve sat there and conversed politely but not eaten anything, or you could\u2019ve done what was suggested and brought a dish yourself. Its actually a fairly common practice in general to bring a dish, or at least offer to bring something, when you\u2019ve been invited to dinner at someone\u2019s house. You could\u2019ve brought something that you like that they could\u2019ve tried and you also could\u2019ve tried what they made for you.

Instead of hearing and respecting your in-laws you decided that you were going to try and bully to get your way. These will be (I should say would have been because if I were your fiance I would NOT be your fiance after this) your in-law family. You decided to create a problem from the beginning and then be disrespectful when they did not give in to your demands.\n\nIf you do not want to eat what was prepared when you are told in advance, then it IS up to you because of your requirements to bring your own thing.", "YTA\u2014 bring your own dish if you won\u2019t eat what\u2019s provided.

She even gave you the courtesy of giving you a heads up, that there would be no food you could eat there. You made the choice to not bring some thing even though she was clear that you should. Honestly you sound incredibly spoiled and entitled. i\u2019m going to gloss right over the fact that you\u2019re just a picky eater and don\u2019t seem to have any actual allergies. But it\u2019s no one else\u2019s job to accommodate you. It certainly would have been nice if she would have tried, but she was very clear that you needed to bring your own. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re never gonna make it past fianc\u00e9 lol", "YTA. What you did was rude and abusive. Take some responsibility. Seems like a deliberate attempt on your part to drive a wedge between you and your in laws. I bet you tell everyone they were at fault when it was all you.", "Woof. Holy princess ridiculous Batman! YTA\n\nI am astonished you\u2019ve come this far in life and don\u2019t realize you need to bring your own food. Wow.", "YTA. As a guest, you don't make demands about the menu to the host. It is horribly rude to do so unless you, your partner, or your child has an allergy.\n\nFMIL told you that she wasn't changing the menu and offered to accommodate your needs by letting you bring food. In this case she is not obligated to cater to your PREFERENCES. If she catered to your preferences that would open her up to having to cater to everyone's preferences, which would become a giant headache. \n\nIf you had a diagnosis such as sensory processing disorder,.I might feel differently. As it is you are just acting spoiled and being a bad guest.", "YTA - Holy entitlement, Batman! They\u2019re making a full Christmas dinner for more people than just you. They didn\u2019t force you to do anything and said you could bring your own. Where\u2019s the confusion?", "Note to your fianc\u00e9e: RUN\nNote to you: YTA", "YTA. Bring your own food if you want to be included or just don't go. You went and made a scene on purpose, making you an even bigger jerk than the one just refusing to go. You're going to get dumped.", "YTA as someone who is Vegetarian AND CELIAC. I would never in a million years ask someone to accommodate me!!! I would rather sit hungry and watch others eat than ask them to make me something or whatever. Bring your own food or order your own food if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t eat the food that\u2019s there. Also I hope you are in therapy for this problem, food is amazing and you shouldn\u2019t be conformed to only a few things. Though it\u2019s nobodies problem but yours, and you can\u2019t think people will do anything for you or change anything for you. Apologize to everyone, but know your boyfriends family (I don\u2019t think you can call them  \u201cfuture in-laws at this point\u201d) will always remember this and you\u2019ve painted yourself a really bad look.", "YTA\n\nI'm the type hostess that will make sure I accommodate allergies, religious needs, vegan etc, but selfish picky eaters with an attitude? Heck no! Not everyone likes to cook and cooking christmas dinner is always stressfull, specially when cooking for several people. She said you were welcome to bring your own food, but you still chose not to and yet you got offended and were rude as the result. \n\nYour never getting invited again, congrats.", "YTA. \n\nYou are a self proclaimed picky eater. If you won't eat a single thing they made then bringing your own food is a good compromise. Expecting them to cater to you is beyond ridiculous.", "Entitled AH.....", "YTA. If they said you couldn't bring anything & you absolutely had to eat exactly what they ate, the assholery would be on them, but that's not what happened here. You had the option to bring your own food that you would eat, you just chose not to out of a sense of entitlement. I say this as someone who has texture aversion issues myself, as does my kid. We bring our own foods to occasions all the time, because it is ultimately *my* responsibility to make sure we have something to eat. Sometimes we get lucky & can eat what's there, but I never, ever expect it, nor should I. It's not other people's jobs to accommodate us.", "YTA It's one thing to ask for accommodations when you're deathly allergic to something, it's another entire to expect to be catered to just because you are a picky eater. When my son was young, he was horribly picky. To the point that if he saw other people eat food he didn't like at the time, he would throw up. If we ate at other people's houses, I made sure that he had something he would eat (usually I brought mac&cheese and he would eat meat as long as it was fried or baked but nothing in a sauce) and that his chair faced \\*away\\* from everyone else. I didn't expect or ask the people hosting us to not make anything he didn't like or even to make the mac&cheese for him. When you're picky, you deal with it yourself, you don't expect others to cater to your whims. (Luckily, he's well over that and is actually very adventurous when it comes to food now.)", "YTA, just bring your own food lol, you visit family for Christmas to be around family, not just to be fed. This could have been handled with 0 conflict, they were ok with you bringing food.\n\nIf it really was such a deal breaker don't go in the first place, it was abundantly clear that they weren't cooking off your wish list.", "[removed]", "Congrats, you\u2019re probably single now.", "Wow yeah YTA.\nTotally spoiled brat behavior. Bringing your own food to a party when you have specific dietary needs is 100% the correct thing to do. \nI don't eat meat, but my family and my husband's family do; so when we gather for holidays, I bring food I know I can eat. \nThese people are already hosting, spending money on food, and preparing food for multiple people, and you want to add to their stress by insisting they make you something special. Real bad way to start a relationship with your new family.", "No matter why you have eating restrictions its youre responsibility to bring your own food and not add even more work onto the host.\n\nYTA. Can you really not even eat bread and vegetables?", "Duh YTA. My kids and I are vegan, imagine if we showed up everywhere expecting vegan dishes made special for us and throwing a little tantrum when we weren\u2019t accommodated. Tbh even using the word \u201caccommodated\u201d feels entitled. Anyway go back to picturing three vegans showing up everywhere crying and moaning they didn\u2019t get their special dishes and think how annoyed you would be. That\u2019s exactly what you sound like only worse bc you\u2019re just a picky eater. Also this is a new part of your family, show some grace and humility. Your FMIL no doubt had a whole pre-planned menu to prepare for her usual guests and isn\u2019t even in the habit (yet, though potentially this relationship will never work out it looks like) of understanding your picky temperament. Smh are these posts even real? YTA", "YTA - 1. It\u2019s reasonable to expect some accommodation for allergies but if you handed the host a long list of what you don\u2019t eat and a list of pre-specified meals that she should cook for you on top of what she\u2019s already cooking, that\u2019s rude.\n\n2. You should have brought a dish, especially if it\u2019s your first holiday there.

You caused the situation.", "Oh my goodness I am literally cringing on my sofa, on your behalf. You don\u2019t seem to have any awareness of how badly you have embarrassed yourself. \n\nYTA.

Bring your own food", "YTA. Majorly!! Shoot my own children have food allergies and when we go to family functions or anywhere I make sure that I bring stuff my kids can have so no one has to worry or go out of their way. You are just being selfish. Why can't you just be grateful that they invited you. My husband is from another country and their food is drastically different then what I grew up with but I still eat it even though I may not like it. It's called respect and common curiosity.  Eek OP sounds like your fiance needs to run before he says I do. SMH", "YTA absolutely. FMIL is cooking for a group of people, if YOU don\u2019t eat what she is cooking, then why is it so hard to bring your own food to eat. YOU are the extremely picky eater but expect everyone to cater to you. That\u2019s not how it works, even when you\u2019re a guest in someone else\u2019s home! Nothing wrong with asking her, but she clearly said no more than once.
