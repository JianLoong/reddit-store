I said I borrowed it to check my facebook log in but he ranted about how I caused him grief at work by taking it without even asking. I reminded him of who bought this laptop to begin with but he said it was supposed to be a gift from me. True, I felt sorry for him and wanted ti get him a proper laptop for work but is it a bad thing?. He said still, I shouldn\"t have taken it and that facebokk log in issue was not an emergency.\n\n\nHe came home lookinh upset and avoided me.

You didn't ask first, didn't tell him, and let him go to work without his work laptop. Just because you paid for it doesn't mean you have free rein to use it, especially if it's for his work. I would expect this from a child, not an adult.\n\nETA: rein, not reign..TIL!", "YTA.\n\nFirst off, you should never use someone's electronics without asking, that's just basic etiquette.\n\nBut secondly, **this is a work laptop**. Which means there is likely information on there that *you* are not privvy to see. \n\nAnd then the cherry on top is that because you ignored point one, he was missing his laptop when he left for work.\n\nGrow up.", "Doesn't he understand that if you didn't log into Facebook at that very second,  you could have missed an important updates on your high school frenemy's latest MLM venture or a humorous meme that you totally relate to or an notification that it's the birthday of your mother's neighbor's dog walker? YTA", "YTA- just for gifting him a laptop and then using it against him. And then also knowing he uses it for work and that he left for work without it. Wtf was going through your head? You typed this up on what? Use your damn phone if anything. There\u2019s zero need to throw a gift in his face and screw up his work just so you can log in to damn Facebook. Wtf.", "Are you serious? YTA. It's his laptop and you took it without asking for logging into Facebook?! Please apologize to the poor guy \ud83d\ude33", "YTA\n\nYou took his laptop without asking, keyword: **HIS**\n\nIt doesn't matter that you bought it, it was a gift and that makes it his laptop. Logging into FB is not an emergency to take a computer you know he needs for work. You sound very entitled here and like you expect an apology from him, when it's the other way around.", "wow, someone who thinks Facebook is more important than a job. \n\nYTA. your log in could\u2019ve waited OR you\u2026could have\u2026told him that you were using his laptop to check your facebook login.\n\nWow.", "YTA\n\nThat was an invasion of privacy first, but then you just let him go to work without it? Of course you were wrong.", "Of course YTA\n\nDid you tell him that you borrowed it to check Facebook? You had to have known he was getting ready to go to work and you didn't even say anything when you heard him leaving. If it's his WORK laptop, doesn't he need it for work? Obviously, not having it would cause problems for him AT WORK. Sure, some might say he should have checked the bag, but I don't check mine because I expect no one to move my work laptop.", "YTA. And you know it.", "It's nice that you bought him a work laptop, but you don't maintain ownership or rights to property you gave away. Furthermore, it sounds like you didn't even bother to tell him so when he left for work he had no idea he was missing his work laptop. You screwed around with his ability to do his job, which isn't just remarkably inconsiderate, it's also stupid. YTA.", "YTA\n\nOf course you are, I mean, come on. This is the laptop he uses for WORK and you just wanted to browse Facebook? It doesn't matter if you bought the thing; it's his WORK laptop. It's quite possible that he signed an agreement not to use social media on it and now he's in trouble over that.", "YTA. Getting him the laptop was a kind gesture, but it's his now. If you needed to borrow it, you should have asked. That he left for work and realised he didn't have a laptop with him once in the office is pretty bad. I also agree that checking Facebook does not seem an emergency to me!", "YTA. Lol, so what you bought him the laptop? You think that's a legit excuse to take his WORK laptop and not bother putting it back? Depending on his line of work, he could get fired and investigated for it if it contains sensitive data. \n\nJust use your mobile if you need to go on Facebook thaaaaat much.", "YTA, I'm afraid. It's his laptop now, regardless of who bought it. I certainly hope you apologize and say it'll never happen again.", "The results are in....YTA! Why would you even tske it without asking him? On top of that, you throw it in his face that you bought it after he snapped at you! If I were your husband, I would give it back and get my own. Being that you like to throw things in people face. All because you wanted to check facebook! Girl bye!", "YTA.\n\nIt's not yours anymore, you gave it to him. Which means : you don't have any claim on it.\n\nYou reason for borrowing it without permission is so shallow. Your urge to use facebook is not more important than your husband's work.", "YTA. You bought it for him - for work! so you sneak it out of his bag and he goes to work without it. Why didn't you just ask him so he knew it wasn't in his bag.", "Does buying someone a gift entitle you to use of that gift for your personal reasons at any time, without the recipients knowledge or consent?\n\nI'll give you a hint, the answer is no and YTA for thinking it does.", "lol what? Of course YTA. Are you 12?", "Absolutely YTA 100%\n\n\nIt was a GIFT, meaning it is NOT YOURS\n\n\nIt is for WORK, you used it for SOCIAL MEDIA\n\n\nYou didn't return it to where it goes, meaning you messed up your husband's day.\n\n\nIt's like your a small child and need everything explaining to you. But of course YTA. You took something that wasn't yours without the consent of its owner.", "YTA. Buying it for him has nothing to do with it. If it was a gift then it is his now and especially with it being his work laptop you shouldn't be using it without asking and then to not put it back in his bag after is even worse.", "YTA. You gave him a gift. Doesn't mean it's yours to do as you please. It's intention was for him to use it for work and you took it out of his bag before he left, leaving him unable to use it at work. \n\nI'm a mechanic by trade, if my wife gave me a screwdriver set as a gift but then used one without me knowing, I'd be pretty pissed when I went to grab it and it was gone.", "I don\u2019t know what his job is but do you understand what being unprepared at work could do? If he needed it that day and had something incredibly important on it but he had to tell him boss his wife had it they\u2019re not going to care about the reason. Deadlines exist, again I don\u2019t know how job, but it\u2019s very important that he has it on him in case he *actually needs it for work, yknow the thing you bought it for, so he can have a work laptop, for work, to bring to work, and not for you to log into Facebook and forget to return it*", "YTA. You took something out of HIS bag, didn\u2019t tell him, and didn\u2019t put it back. But you\u2019re wondering if YTA?!?", "YTA checking your Facebook log in comes before his work? If you take it out, you put it back. A child could understand this", "YTA..... You bought it for him now he owns it, and stop reminding him that you are the one who bought it, he knows it.", "YTA - you took HIS laptop without telling him... didn't return it and then are surprised that he is upset because he got to work without his laptop...\n\nThen you throw it in his face that you bought it?? When you buy someone a gift, it is their gift... not yours .", "YTA A) you should have told him before he left work. B) You don\u2019t retain ownership of a gift C) could you really not got a few hours without Facebook?", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t buy things for people if you\u2019re going to hold it over their head. I couldn\u2019t imagine living that way \u201cWeLl I bOuGhT iT fOr YoU\u201d that would be utterly and completely annoying. \n\nYou\u2019re an asshole for being inconsiderate and for your response.", "YTA. Doesn't matter if you gave it to him or not. That is a WORK laptop. Which means that he needs it for work. So you should've just left it alone instead of worrying about stupid Facebook. He could've gotten into big trouble because of you.", "YTA fb can wait, his work cannot.", "I'm sure your husband would have been happy for you to use the laptop if you told him you were using it and/or responsibly put it back when you were done. Instead you harmed his job through your carelessness.\n\nYTA", "YTA Just because you bought it, does not mean it\u2019s ok to take without asking. It belongs to him and to make it worse, it\u2019s something he uses for work.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if you bought it, it\u2019s his! You have no ownership once you give a gift. You should apologize for taking it without asking and for not understanding why he\u2019s upset.", "It was your gift FOR HIM, therefore it\u2019s his property, not yours. You caused him troubles at work. And you\u2019re still asking? YTA.", "YTA. He got to work and realized he didn\u2019t have it, which could have had consequences with his colleagues/boss.

You gave it to him.  Therefore it's HIS regardless if you bought or not.  It's HIS, not YOURS, he uses it for WORK.  YOU took it out of HIS bag without telling him.

YTA so much my cat can see it. \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, absolutely YTA.\n\nIf it was given as a gift, it's HIS laptop regardless if you paid for it.

No wonder he\u2019s be upset, and so would I if that was my laptop.", "YTA, Facebook is not that important", "YTA, it\u2019s his computer regardless of who bought it for him", "YTA. You gave him a gift, used that gift to guilt him, and used his gift for a trivial reason! Apologize and do better!", "YTA. It\u2019s his laptop, not to mention the fact that it is used for work.

Also, a gift is a gift. Once it is given, you no longer have any claim to it or any say about it. And IT WAS FOR WORK!!!", "I hope this is a joke. Of course you're the AH.\n\nYou aren't very clear in your post. If you knew you had his laptop and you knew he was leaving for work, why didn't you give it back???\n\nYou ask if you should have borrowed it without permission. No, you shouldn't have. But TBH that is the least offensive part. Letting him leave without it, throwing the fact that you bought it in his face, and then your reaction after the fact are all worse.", "YTA you sound like an entitled child rather then a grown adult.

I'm seriously baffled. Spoiler: Gifting him the laptop was the one thing you did good.", "Cartoonishly YTA.\n\nDidn't Mommy and Daddy teach you:\n\n1. Ask before taking something\n2. Put it back where you found it\n\nWouldn't the expectation be that a \"work\" laptop be needed at work?", "YTA.. you caused issues at work to check social media.. he uses the computer for work.

Your Facebook isn't that urgent to be checked.", "YTA, why didn't you ask before taking it? It doesn't matter that you bought it for him.

Doesn't matter who gave it to him.", "YTA, you reminded him you bought if for him? That\u2019s a really callous answer, it comes from defensiveness- you were afraid to acknowledge how messed up your actions were and how bad the consequences were, so you tried to reframe the whole issue and cast yourself as\u2026not the bad guy here. That\u2019s a red flag for your husband\u2026his wife is emotionally immature and selfish. \n\nYou need to acknowledge that you behaved selfishly and acknowledge that his day was hugely impacted by your selfishness\u2026if you care at all about repairing this situation.", "YTA. You don't retain any rights to things you have gifted to other people.", "Yta. That is so immature. Your husband needs the laptop to do his job. You couldn\u2019t have checked Facebook another time?", "Regardless of whether you paid for it or not, it is still his. The man uses that laptop for WORK and you took it without informing him and he left for work only to find that his laptop is not in his laptop bag.

Ohhh, you bought it... But you gave it to him, so it's his now.

You wanted him to have a proper laptop so you gave him one. So then he goes to work and has no laptop. \nDid you know he was leaving without it?

It\u2019s a WORK laptop. If he has proprietary information on that laptop and you had access to it, even if you didn\u2019t view the information, he could lose his job.", "Good grief yes YTA\n\nIt is a WORK laptop. Log into FB in your own laptop, phone or tablet. That it caused him issues at work makes it even worse.", "YTA. You caused him issues at work so you could log in to Facebook? Is this for real? I would be FUMING if that was me! What was he meant to do at work? Twiddle his thumbs? Did you know he had left for work? Did you not think to say \u201coh wait a sec! I have your laptop!\u201d", "YTA big time. It is HIS work laptop. You don't touch it without asking. No matter if you're the one who offered it (unless you're one of those a-hole who buy gifts with unspoken conditions?).\n\nYou messed with your partner's work. So now handle it like a big girl. You understand you overstepped, you apologize and you do something nice for him as your apology was delayed.", "YTA - It wasnt yours to take, it being a gift makes you in no way entitled to use it. You were wrong and should apologize.", "yup you are the ah. look up the definition of gift", "YTA it was a gift, you can\u2019t borrow a gift you gave to somebody without their permission with the excuse that you yourself basically own it because you bought it.", "YTA Don't touch other people's stuff without asking. It doesn't matter if you bought it. I bought my partner a guitar for Christmas,  but that doesn't mean I can screw around with it without asking.\n\nAlso you knew he was going to work soon. Why would you think he wouldn't take his work laptop with him?", "YTA and I suspect you've only posted in the hope of garnering misplaced sympathy and possible defense strategies.", "YTA. You took his laptop and let him go to work without it. Let's imagine that he had an important presentation for work on it and he left for work expecting that it was still in the bag where he'd placed it, and then he goes to pull it out to do the presentation and it's not there. He could've gotten in huge trouble at work in such a scenario.\n\nMoreover, this was some super minor reason for you to borrow it, and you didn't ask him or tell him.", "Yta. You bought it ~for him~ you gave it to him, it is his. It is not yours to do what you want with especially not when it has an impact on his ability to do his job.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re shocked he was pissed that you took his laptop, didn\u2019t tel him, and he left for work not knowing it wasn\u2019t in his bag\u2026.?", "Yta- when I grab my things for work, I know that everything I need is in my work bag. I know that because I put it there. If someone removed an essential piece of equipment from my work bag and didn\u2019t put it back, I\u2019d have problems at work. So yeah, don\u2019t do that. It doesn\u2019t matter if you paid for it. He needs it to work. Had you said to him, hey I need to use your laptop for a few minutes, he would have known it wasn\u2019t in his bag and he might\u2019ve been able to grab it before work, avoiding problems.", "Ofc YTA, it amazes me that you have to even ask this question.", "YTA. How can you think the laptop you gifted him, that he uses for work no less, is yours to do with as you please?", "YTA for many reasons.\n\n1) you took something you knew he had packed for work\n\n2) you took it for Facebook.   Facebook is not a necessity \n\n3) DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A GIFT IS?!  YOU HAVE NO CLAIM OVER IT \n\n4)", "YTA and also seem to not understand how gifts work. Gifts are not to be shared by the gifter and recipient. You bought it for him, but how does that mean you can just take it whenever you want? You gave it to him, it is belongs to him now. And I think you should obviously understand that needing his laptop for work is clearly more important than you being able to log into your facebook. Hell, you didn\u2019t even ask!\n\nNext time use your fucking phone.", "Of course YTA. You took his work laptop literally right before he left for work. You didn\u2019t even have a good reason for taking it - you just wanted to check fb! I would never, ever check my social media on my husband\u2019s work laptop. That\u2019s just inappropriate. And then instead of just apologizing and admitting you messed up, you felt the need to bring up that you bought it for him? You bought it FOR HIM. Is it your laptop or is it his? \n\nYou were wrong. Apologize, move on, and don\u2019t do it again.", "YTA! \n\nYou know it too! You clearly stated you purchased it for HIM, FOR WORK!! Do you all not say bye to one another before leaving and you may have thought, \u201coh damn, LAPTOP!!!\u201d I mean!! I know I have a personal laptop I use for work, no sensitive information on it BUT that doesn\u2019t mean I DON\u2019T NEED IT!!!  Ma\u2019am you knew the answer to your question before you posted!! You are just the A-hole, you are very inconsiderate!", "YTA. Either it\u2019s his laptop or you gave it to him with strings attached. You had no right to take the laptop without permission. He\u2019s right, Facebook is not an emergency. you owe him apology.", "YTA It is his work laptop! There might be contact data if his customers or things that have a silence agreement on it. My contract says that I am not allowed to share any information about my customers with anybody. \n\nNever use something from work. It is really important that he can trust you to not snoop around.\n\nThat you bought it is irrelevant. It is his now. If he gave you nice underwear for christmas and insisted to wear it from time to time, because he bought it you will most likely be pissed as well.", "YTA. I can't believe you even question if you are. A gift means it is his. He had it in his bag ready for work and you wanted to check your Facebook? Seriously? Grow up!", "YTA. If your \u201cgift\u201d came with a string attached that you could use it for any reason at any time without telling him, then you should have been up front about that.", "YTA. You gave him the laptop.  It is now his. You lost every right to use when you gifted it to him.  PARTICULARLY because he uses it at work, you are really in the wrong here for taking it out for something as trivial as a facebook login and not replacing it before he left for work. I sure hope you drove it in for him, because otherwise you're doubly the asshole.  No, make that triple because you are trying to convince us you did nothing wrong.", "YTA. \u201cI reminded him of who bought this laptop to begin with\u201d. For that alone YTA. Gifts, especially ones used for work, don\u2019t entitle you to access without permission.", "YTA \u201cbUt I bOuGhT iT fOr HiM\u201d Are you familiar with the concept of a gift? \n\nYou checking facebook isn\u2019t gonna put food on the table, his job is.

Seriously?", "People have already made good points, but here's something I haven't seen yet:\n\nYTA. If you gift something, it no longer belongs to you. If you buy something for someone as a gift, it *never* belonged to you. Just because you bought it does not mean that it is yours or that you are allowed to use it.\n\nAnd like others have said, it's not a personal laptop. It's a work laptop. He needs it *for work*.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't loan him the laptop.\n\nYou ***gave*** him the laptop for ***WORK*****!!!**\n\nIt is no longer yours, regardless of who holds the receipt.", "YTA - A gift to someone means that it belongs to the receiver and the giver shouldn\u2019t be hanging it over his/her head who bought it, how much it cost, etc. \n\nSure, checking another device when it comes to not being able to log into an account is a good way to check, but it should have taken only a few minutes to verify and you should have put his laptop back where you got it from. \n\nAs someone who works completely off a PC, I would be pissed if I got to work, couldn\u2019t find my laptop, and found out my spouse took it out to check social media and didn\u2019t put it back. My husband relies on his the same way and I would expect him to be pissed as well.", "So because you bought it means you can take it whenever you want?? No it doesn't work that way you bloody well ask if you can borrow it", "YTA. A gift means it's no longer yours. He uses it for work, and you just took it. Unbelievable.", "YTA you took his work computer from his work bag and let him leave for work while you still had it?\n\nFB isn't an emergency that could excuse this at all.", "YTA", "YTA. Put things back where you found them. It's the same basic principals of living with people- you replace the toilet paper when you use the last of it, you text that you're almost out of milk while you still have a cup or two left, you don't go moving other people's stuff. If I put a sandwich in my lunch bag, and then left for work, I'd expect my sandwich was still in fact in my lunch bag. I wouldn't check for it because thats where I put it. Yes, you may have been the one to go to the store to buy the bread and peanut butter, but that is my sandwich that I was intending to eat and I would expect it to be where I left it because my partner's not inconsiderate.", "YTA. Stop buying him gifts if you take them back whenever you want", "INFO: Do you not own a smartphone you can log into FB with?\n\nEdit: I kind of waited for OP's answer, but YTA anyway, because how hard is it to respect your partner's boundaries? You gifting him a laptop doesn't give you a free pass to use it.
