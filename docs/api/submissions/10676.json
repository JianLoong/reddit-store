I took over the mortgage. I didn't charge her rent. I paid all the taxes and condo levies.  She got enough money from her insurance and a side hustle to live there.  My wife knew we were helping her but we didn't say anything because her mom was pissed that she didn't move home after her diagnosis.  \n\nDiane passed away last month. She had a hard life for the last decade but she was happy.  \n\nWhen her mom got a copy of the will she was furious. The apartment is worth a lot of money not.  It's in a great building in a good neighborhood. She was expecting the apartment to sell and for there to be money to split up amongst all of her grandchildren. Diane never married and never had kids.\n\nMIL found out about the deal I made with Diane. My wife and I own the apartment outright.

If her family members had chipped in to support her during the last ten years, perhaps there would be an estate worth fighting over.", "NTA. \n\nYour in-laws sound really greedy. If it\u2019s all about helping family - why didn\u2019t they help Diane out financially when she needed their support? They didn\u2019t support her when it wouldn\u2019t benefit them, but now that she\u2019s gone they expect some financial gain from her death?? \n\nI know grief does weird things to people, but that\u2019s just such a screwed up mindset.", "Nta. Honestly, just tell the truth. None of them were there to help her financially when she was sick and dying and now they are vultures trying profit from her corpse.

I think it\u2019s great you helped out Diane when she needed it and it seems like she knew exactly what she was getting into (with the apartment deal). It\u2019s really up to you and your wife because it\u2019s your money. Why would you give all your niblings $3k when it\u2019s your investment?? Seems like you have some unreasonable people to deal with but I don\u2019t think you should feel bad about keeping YOUR apartment.", "NTA- you bought the apartment. It\u2019s yours. They are not entitled to that money. You helped Diane out immensely when her family wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. Any funds in her estate would be her proceeds from the sale of the apartment, which wouldn\u2019t have been much as she was only a couple of years into the mortgage had she sold it traditionally. \n\nThe family can pound sand.", "NTA.  You helped Diane and made a good investment as well.  MIL is delusional", "NTA.    If she was of sound mind at the time she sold it to you and did not ask you to make any special arrangements after her death, there is absolutely no reason to believe she would be upset now.  I have no doubt she knew that you saw it as an investment, and the truth is, there was still risk for you, both due to the housing market and uncertainty over her own condition--what if she had lived another 5-10 years?", "You helped out your SIL. when she wa alive she had the ability to stay where she wanted and wasn\u2019t forced where she didn\u2019t want to be. \n\nYOU DID NOTHING WRONG - NTA!!\n\nYour MIL is being extremely greedy. She wanted the apartment. Who knows she may not have sold it at all - she may have kept if She decided to. She is playing victim. Ignore her and move on with your life.", "Completely.NTA.  just think back to what you did for Diane.  You jumped in and bought it, when she was desperate.  You took the risk.  Property values could have gone anywhere, and are very unpredictable. Let the family say what they want.  You had the assets to make this investment because you had carefully managed your finances previously.  Any of her other family members could have done this if they actually focused.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.  This is what comes of careful management of money and looking ahead.  Do not think you took advantage because you didn\u2019t.  Don\u2019t let that cheap grasping family cheat you out of what you earned.", "NTA. Her family had a chance to help her out and didn't.  Basic math says you have been paying about $36,000 a year. For ten years.  Plus the down payment.  If you had invested that money instead how much would you have?  You are being reasonable and they are being greedy.  If it will get them off your back do the $3,000 thing.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry the guilting is working on your wife, but the family has no leg to stand on.  I think what\u2019s hurting your MIL (in addition to grief obviously) is that she didn\u2019t know you bought the apartment.

If they aren't willing to give you the 1/3 you are asking for, they can piss off too.  Don't give the $3,000 either.", "NTA Diane asked you for help and you gave it, you let her live there for free so she could spend her remaining years in the home she loved.  If you hadn't done that, it'd belong to someone else now anyway.  They have zero claim to it, and need to let it go.", "NTA.  It speaks volumes that her mom was unaware of all the help you gave your sil for the 10 yrs prior.    Shows she wasnt very involved in her daughter's life and she certainly was not involved in helping her financially.  Yet her hand is the first one grabbing for money to benefit off her daughter's death.  She is projecting what she is doing onto OP.\n\nIf her daughter wanted to help her niblings in any way she had 10 yrs to put something in place.  My guess is she had little interaction with them or her mother. And at the end of her life she chose not to go back home but to remain close to you and your wife.\n\nYour mil is a greedy self centered bully.  Dont let your wife give in to any of her demands.  What her mother should be doing is being thankful her daughter's last years werent plagued by financial concerns because of you and your wife.  So she should also be thankful God/ The universe is rewarding you with the increase in value in the property which will fund your retirement, which is partially what you did for your sil.", "NAH. So Diane didn\u2019t want to move home. Why? An overbearing mother? Why didn\u2019t Diane tell her mom she no longer owned her apt? Because she didn\u2019t care enough to get into it? Why didn\u2019t her mother ever think to ask, \u201cdaughter of mine whose dying, how are you getting by\u201d? It feels like you got hooked into someone else\u2019s drama. Keep your foot and head down.", "I think Diane's will said it all. If Diane wanted the apartment sold and proceeds distributed, it would have said that.

It\u2019s is your place.", "Wow daughter dies and mum is there waiting with her hand out. Come on do you really think you're the AH? Your wife is feeling guilty cause... family, but ask her where was family when her sister needed the financial help? Oh that's right waiting for her to die to get their hands on what was left.  NTA and you owe them nothing.", "NTA and don't give it to the rest of them or pay them off. None of them wanted to or could help her and now they're acting like sharks in the water and thinking they're going to get a payday. I would never expect something after one of my aunts or uncles passed away. They wouldn't have gotten anything if she had just rented the apartment either or if she'd lost it to forclosure for not paying. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA. Your wife needs to get angry.   YOU Are the reason her sister wasn\u2019t homeless while battling cancer.   Not her family -they had an opportunity  to help and passed it by \u2026 YOU kept her from being homeless and didn\u2019t charge any rent \n\nThey are upset that they can\u2019t benefit as much as they thought they would from her death.

You and your SIL had a contract.  You enabled her to stay in a home she loved.  You didn't even charge her token rental.  If she had sold the apartment to someone else, she would have ended up having to pay rent.  Her family wouldn't have gotten the apartment in that scenario, either.  You invested in a piece of property.  That your SIL benefited from your investment is a bonus.  Other members of the family could have tried to put the financing together to make it work but they didn't.  The apartment was your SIL's property to dispose of as she saw fit.  Tell your wife to ride it out.  Her family is being greedy.  If you want to, you can put $3k in a trust fund for each nephew, but only if you want to.  You are not obligated to do so and her family should be grateful you are willing to do anything.", "NTA - Its amazing what assholes relatives become when someone dies and they think they might get something.  You helped Diane out when things were hard for her, they didn\u2019t.  They can all just screw off, they are showing their true colors in that the o my thing they are concerned about is how much they can get from this.", "NTA.

Everyone else can be as pissed as they want for not getting free money.", "Don\u2019t give in to them. This is your retirement money and you deserve it. Just tell your wife your keeping it and will not discuss it with her family anymore. Because of you Diane was able to live rent free in her apartment and enjoy her last years. She didn\u2019t want to go home to her mother either, so you saved her from that.

It is your apartment. \n\nHer family is showing their true colours.", "NTA,  It sounds like a big \"win-win\".  She got want she wanted, to remain in her home, live a life she preferred/enjoyed, and not move.  You made a good investment that helped a friend.  You don't have to have been altruistic to NBTA.", "NTA. You relieved a significant financial burden and provided safe and stable housing for someone going through a serious illness for *ten years*. She went went through her final years without worrying about having to leave her home for financial reasons. If it was me that was sick I would be extremely grateful that someone took care of me like that and would absolutely consider that transferring ownership of the apartment to you was a perfectly reasonable compensation. \n\nAlso, don't give the family any money at this time if there's any possibility they might sue.

That's just what happens if you end up timing property in a hot market correctly.\n\nIf Diane gave them a deal on the initial purchase, I could see a reasonable peace offering to be paying them out the difference between OP's purchase price and 2012 fair market value, but there's no moral argument to be made that the post-2012 FMV gains belong to anybody but OP.  Granted, I don't think the family would be amenable to anything but complete capitulation by OP given their behavior so far, so I'd tell them to pound sand.", "OP,  here's your answer. \nBe cautious about the $3000.

She could have sold and gotten 40k-ish but she would have spent way more than that on rent in the following decade and her housing may not have been secure. It's a great trade for her.\n\nThe gain that he got from buying the apartment at lower than market rate is wiped out by the fact that he was unable to rent it out for a decade. The only financial benefit he received is the increase in capital value over that period, while he had to say no to other investment opportunities because his money was tied up. It's a good deal overall and he has benefited from it but SIL got an incredible deal and everything positive he gets out of it was well and truly deserved.", "Just to be clear it went up 30 percent even before she was able to move in.  Then she lived there for 2 years before she got breast cancer and then an additional 3 years before she sold it to them. Clearly it could have doubled in price during that time.  Maybe even more. So it looks like she got it very cheaply to begin with and they bought it at that very cheap price.", "There was also prop taxes, condo levies,  mortgage interest, etc..

Expecting to profit off your own child's death (in the case of her mom) seems rather ghoulish to me.

Legally they have no leg to stand on and morally? They didn't help Diane. Why should they profit here? They're just being entitled. \n\nYou are allowed to profit on an investment. Do you think Diane was unaware that you would come out with a benefit? She would have to be a dumbass to not know. It's a reasonable trade especially since you didn't charge her for the luxury of staying in a safer neighborhood and getting care where she wanted to be. \n\nI think you may have to cut ties with people but lay out your costs without any offers of more and ask them what they did that matches this for Diane if you want to piss off some folks but make a point. Altruistic ideals are lovely but aren't sustainable in a capitalistic society", "You bought her apartment, paid the associated fees and taxes, and let her live there rent-free for ten years until she passed?

We were glad he was in a position to assist. \n\nYour offer to pay them the equity increase minus expenses is generous. It doesn't sound like you owe them anything, and if they've refused your offer, I'd consider the case closed. But that's just my opinion.

No shame, you helped someone because you could.", "NTA\n\n> Full disclosure. I knew it was a good investment. It wasn't fully altruistic.  \n\nWhat you did for Diane is offer her a \"Retained Life Estate\" or  \"Reverse Mortgage\". This is very common with people who are old or sick \u2013 they sell their home to investors, or donate it to a non-profit, and continue to live in it for free until they die. Depending on the value of the home and the seller's life expectancy, the new owners will cut them a monthly check, cover expenses, or both. Many US colleges are heavily funded/invested in this practice.\n\nAltruistic or not, it is almost always a great deal for the seller. As you said, after you factor in 10 years of expenses, you're only looking at a 24k net gain on the transaction against the current market price.  \n\nIf you did not make this deal with her, she would have eventually made a similar one with someone else - and the terms would not have been as beneficial to her.  \n\nThe only way I can fathom the OP being bad, is if they kept hoping the SIL would quickly die so the investment performs better. \n\nI would put my foot down and tell my wife to make sure my MIL + Family understands this or I would publicly and loudly tell them to fuck off and shame her.  At this point, there is no act that you can do to save your relationship with the MIL - she will never forgive you and hold this against you for eternity.  The MIL is lashing out at you over money, but her real anger is over help financing your SIL to live alone and not move home to be fully dependent on her.

They obviously saw her as nothing more than a cash cow.

Her mom may resent and think that you and your wife (her own daughter) was the reason Diane didn\u2019t move back in with her. She\u2019s right, of course, but that\u2019s certainly not what Diane wanted and her opinion is the only one that matters.\n\nAlso, as another poster suggested, show this thread to the mother/family - it might give them a different perspective. Likely not, but at least they\u2019ll know that not everyone is on their side.", "I think you\u2019re right but there\u2019s more than a little opportunism from OP too. He knew this was a gift horse and he knew that when his friend died there would be plenty of financial benefit. Not wrong. Not right. Just how it works.", "NTA. And fuck them. The level to which you helped your SIL is pretty extraordinary. Your wife should be thinking about that too.", "You purchased the place and took full responsibility for it. The market could have crashed. Would they all be chipping in to cover a loss if there was one?\n\nJust because it in hindsight was a good investment doesn't mean they are entitled to it too. It sounds like your in-laws are people who don't understand risk and responsibility. On top of that, you supported Diane and let her live the life she wanted. Diane knew what she was doing. You fulfilled your end of the bargain by allowing her to live there rent-free for a very long time. She didn't make that deal with them. They didn't support her. They don't deserve the benefits of the support you gave. I might be generous with Christmas gifts or something, but that's it.", "What song is it?", "Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift.", "Diane was fully aware of the situation and she died where she wanted to be. She WAS happy. Your in-laws are trying to guilt you and your wife because of their own greed. Diane had what she wanted and needed because you were willing to help her. Without you, she would have died in a place she didn\u2019t want to be and not in her own terms. She didn\u2019t want to be where MIL wanted her- and MIL resents that. They are lashing out because what you and Diane agreed to is need to them. Too bad. They will get over it, eventually.\n\nPlease do not sacrifice your financial security nor tarnish the decade long gift you gave to Diane by letting the in-laws sully it. Stick to providing the truth and nothing more. \n\nIf necessary, go low contact for awhile. Tell them this topic is off limits. They were not part of the arrangement and they did not contribute to her financial support, so it isn\u2019t their business. Please encourage your wife to see a grief counselor so she can deal with her unfounded guilt and understandable sadness. \n\nNTA", "I would make one last email to the family saying:  \n\nRegarding Diane's condo:  We purchased the condo from Diane in XXX at her request.  She wanted to continue to live in her condo, but could no longer afford it.  Since XXX, we have paid all bills associated with the condo and allowed Diane to live there rent-free.  We are very grateful that we were able to provide Diane with the financial assistance she needed to live out her life where and how she wanted.  Whatever Diane had left over from the sale of her condo is what is part of her estate.  The condo we purchased from her (and provided as a home for her for XX years) is not.  This will be the last time either of us have any discussion with anyone in the family on this subject.", "I know I did until you said something, and reminded me. Good call on that point!"]}
