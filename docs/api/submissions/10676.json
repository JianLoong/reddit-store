She didn't sell it because it was perfect for her. \n\nUnfortunately she was diagnosed with breast cancer about two years after she took possession.  She really didn't want to move back to Minnesota so she asked her family for money to keep up with the mortgage.  None of them had the money.  And her mom really wanted her to move home.  \n\nI was friends with her before I married her sister. Just friends. Nothing more. She asked me for help. I bought the apartment off her. I took over the mortgage. I didn't charge her rent. I paid all the taxes and condo levies.  She got enough money from her insurance and a side hustle to live there.  My wife knew we were helping her but we didn't say anything because her mom was pissed that she didn't move home after her diagnosis.  \n\nDiane passed away last month. She had a hard life for the last decade but she was happy.  \n\nWhen her mom got a copy of the will she was furious. The apartment is worth a lot of money not.  It's in a great building in a good neighborhood. She was expecting the apartment to sell and for there to be money to split up amongst all of her grandchildren. Diane never married and never had kids.\n\nMIL found out about the deal I made with Diane. My wife and I own the apartment outright.

I said I would be willing to do that in return for each of them paying one third of the money I invested over the last ten years.  They don't think that's fair.  My wife is upset and her family is upset and I'm just trying to be fair to myself.  I spent ten years giving up other investments and toys for myself and helped out Diane instead.

If her family members had chipped in to support her during the last ten years, perhaps there would be an estate worth fighting over.", "NTA. \n\nYour in-laws sound really greedy. If it\u2019s all about helping family - why didn\u2019t they help Diane out financially when she needed their support? They didn\u2019t support her when it wouldn\u2019t benefit them, but now that she\u2019s gone they expect some financial gain from her death?? \n\nI know grief does weird things to people, but that\u2019s just such a screwed up mindset.", "Nta. Honestly, just tell the truth. None of them were there to help her financially when she was sick and dying and now they are vultures trying profit from her corpse.

I think it\u2019s great you helped out Diane when she needed it and it seems like she knew exactly what she was getting into (with the apartment deal). It\u2019s really up to you and your wife because it\u2019s your money. Why would you give all your niblings $3k when it\u2019s your investment?? Seems like you have some unreasonable people to deal with but I don\u2019t think you should feel bad about keeping YOUR apartment.", "NTA- you bought the apartment. It\u2019s yours. They are not entitled to that money. You helped Diane out immensely when her family wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. Any funds in her estate would be her proceeds from the sale of the apartment, which wouldn\u2019t have been much as she was only a couple of years into the mortgage had she sold it traditionally. \n\nThe family can pound sand.", "NTA.  You helped Diane and made a good investment as well.  MIL is delusional", "NTA.    If she was of sound mind at the time she sold it to you and did not ask you to make any special arrangements after her death, there is absolutely no reason to believe she would be upset now.  I have no doubt she knew that you saw it as an investment, and the truth is, there was still risk for you, both due to the housing market and uncertainty over her own condition--what if she had lived another 5-10 years?", "You helped out your SIL. when she wa alive she had the ability to stay where she wanted and wasn\u2019t forced where she didn\u2019t want to be. \n\nYOU DID NOTHING WRONG - NTA!!\n\nYour MIL is being extremely greedy. She wanted the apartment. Who knows she may not have sold it at all - she may have kept if She decided to. She is playing victim. Ignore her and move on with your life.", "Completely.NTA.  just think back to what you did for Diane.  You jumped in and bought it, when she was desperate.  You took the risk.  Property values could have gone anywhere, and are very unpredictable. Let the family say what they want.  You had the assets to make this investment because you had carefully managed your finances previously.  Any of her other family members could have done this if they actually focused.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.  This is what comes of careful management of money and looking ahead.  Do not think you took advantage because you didn\u2019t.  Don\u2019t let that cheap grasping family cheat you out of what you earned.", "NTA. Her family had a chance to help her out and didn't.  Basic math says you have been paying about $36,000 a year. For ten years.  Plus the down payment.  If you had invested that money instead how much would you have?  You are being reasonable and they are being greedy.  If it will get them off your back do the $3,000 thing.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry the guilting is working on your wife, but the family has no leg to stand on.  I think what\u2019s hurting your MIL (in addition to grief obviously) is that she didn\u2019t know you bought the apartment.

If they aren't willing to give you the 1/3 you are asking for, they can piss off too.  Don't give the $3,000 either.", "NTA Diane asked you for help and you gave it, you let her live there for free so she could spend her remaining years in the home she loved.  If you hadn't done that, it'd belong to someone else now anyway.  They have zero claim to it, and need to let it go.", "NTA.  It speaks volumes that her mom was unaware of all the help you gave your sil for the 10 yrs prior.    Shows she wasnt very involved in her daughter's life and she certainly was not involved in helping her financially.  Yet her hand is the first one grabbing for money to benefit off her daughter's death.  She is projecting what she is doing onto OP.\n\nIf her daughter wanted to help her niblings in any way she had 10 yrs to put something in place.  My guess is she had little interaction with them or her mother. And at the end of her life she chose not to go back home but to remain close to you and your wife.\n\nYour mil is a greedy self centered bully.  Dont let your wife give in to any of her demands.  What her mother should be doing is being thankful her daughter's last years werent plagued by financial concerns because of you and your wife.  So she should also be thankful God/ The universe is rewarding you with the increase in value in the property which will fund your retirement, which is partially what you did for your sil.", "NAH. So Diane didn\u2019t want to move home. Why? An overbearing mother? Why didn\u2019t Diane tell her mom she no longer owned her apt? Because she didn\u2019t care enough to get into it? Why didn\u2019t her mother ever think to ask, \u201cdaughter of mine whose dying, how are you getting by\u201d? It feels like you got hooked into someone else\u2019s drama. Keep your foot and head down.", "I think Diane's will said it all. If Diane wanted the apartment sold and proceeds distributed, it would have said that.

It\u2019s is your place.", "Wow daughter dies and mum is there waiting with her hand out. Come on do you really think you're the AH? Your wife is feeling guilty cause... family, but ask her where was family when her sister needed the financial help? Oh that's right waiting for her to die to get their hands on what was left.  NTA and you owe them nothing.", "NTA and don't give it to the rest of them or pay them off. None of them wanted to or could help her and now they're acting like sharks in the water and thinking they're going to get a payday. I would never expect something after one of my aunts or uncles passed away. They wouldn't have gotten anything if she had just rented the apartment either or if she'd lost it to forclosure for not paying. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA. Your wife needs to get angry.   YOU Are the reason her sister wasn\u2019t homeless while battling cancer.   Not her family -they had an opportunity  to help and passed it by \u2026 YOU kept her from being homeless and didn\u2019t charge any rent \n\nThey are upset that they can\u2019t benefit as much as they thought they would from her death.

You and your SIL had a contract.  You enabled her to stay in a home she loved.  You didn't even charge her token rental.  If she had sold the apartment to someone else, she would have ended up having to pay rent.  Her family wouldn't have gotten the apartment in that scenario, either.  You invested in a piece of property.  That your SIL benefited from your investment is a bonus.  Other members of the family could have tried to put the financing together to make it work but they didn't.  The apartment was your SIL's property to dispose of as she saw fit.  Tell your wife to ride it out.  Her family is being greedy.  If you want to, you can put $3k in a trust fund for each nephew, but only if you want to.  You are not obligated to do so and her family should be grateful you are willing to do anything.", "NTA - Its amazing what assholes relatives become when someone dies and they think they might get something.  You helped Diane out when things were hard for her, they didn\u2019t.  They can all just screw off, they are showing their true colors in that the o my thing they are concerned about is how much they can get from this.", "NTA.

Everyone else can be as pissed as they want for not getting free money.", "Don\u2019t give in to them. This is your retirement money and you deserve it. Just tell your wife your keeping it and will not discuss it with her family anymore. Because of you Diane was able to live rent free in her apartment and enjoy her last years. She didn\u2019t want to go home to her mother either, so you saved her from that.

I took over the mortgage. \n\nINFO: these are 2 different things.

It is your apartment. \n\nHer family is showing their true colours.", "NTA,  It sounds like a big \"win-win\".  She got want she wanted, to remain in her home, live a life she preferred/enjoyed, and not move.  You made a good investment that helped a friend.  You don't have to have been altruistic to NBTA.", "NTA. You relieved a significant financial burden and provided safe and stable housing for someone going through a serious illness for *ten years*. She went went through her final years without worrying about having to leave her home for financial reasons. If it was me that was sick I would be extremely grateful that someone took care of me like that and would absolutely consider that transferring ownership of the apartment to you was a perfectly reasonable compensation. \n\nAlso, don't give the family any money at this time if there's any possibility they might sue.

I would block them.", "> I showed her a spreadsheet of all our costs \n\nFacts don\u2019t matter to entitled people. \n\nNTA and I am sorry for your loss.", "Exactly, and I think there is an underlying reason she didn\u2019t want to move back closer to her family. NTA", "OP, you need to tell your wife to stand up to her family. She\u2019s lucky to be married to someone who helped her sister for so long, whether it\u2019s eventually going to benefit you or not, and she\u2019s trying to throw away y\u2019all\u2019s financial future to satisfy her greedy mother. NTA, I would be distancing myself from these people.", "No, give them the truth. \n\n> Apparently, some of Diane's family members are spreading lies that we stole her home from her, and that is why it isn't part of the estate, to be sold off and split between her nieces and nephews. So let me give you, as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story.\n\n> When Diane got too sick to work, she thought she was going to lose her home. She thought she would have to move home to Minnesota, away from her friends and the life she had made. And she didn't want that. So we made a deal\n\n> We bought her home. And yes, we bought it for less than the market value at the time. But the deal was that Diane would continue to live in her home, rent free, for the rest of her life. And for the past 10 years, we have paid the mortgage, we have paid the property taxes, and we have paid for maintenance and upkeep. And we did this so that our sister and our friend could live as independently as possible for as long as possible.\n\n> This hurt us financially. We couldn't take big vacations. We couldn't buy cool things. We missed out on investment opportunities. We  could only put a little aside for retirement. But we did it gladly, because we loved Diane.\n\n> And now that Diane has passed, and we can finally use this property to help fund our retirement, the people who never had a dollar to help us provide for her want the proceeds of our time and our investment shared with them. \n\n> Well, that's not going to happen.", "NTA and this is the perfect response!", "Diane sold the apartment to OP 10 years ago. She can't will it.", "I know she can't.  That's why it wasn't in the will.  MIL made huge erroneous assumptions that had nothing to do with reality bc the apartment wasn't left to anyone in the will.", "She lived there for free for years. What are you not understanding?", "Coz it wasn\u2019t their business. Diane was a grown woman and lived where she wanted to live.    She did what she wanted to do."]}
