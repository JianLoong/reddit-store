Our history teacher is from another region so she doesn't know Kashubian.\n\nOur history teacher is a massive bitch, everyone hates her. We love all our other teachers. She yells at us for stupid reasons, she talks to us about her relationship issues, she gives us insane amount of homework and never explains anything. She is so inefficient she tries to hold us back for like 15 minutes so we're always late to our next classes. Because she's inefficient she gives us hours of homework, 80% of all homework i do is hers.\n\nShe gave us homework for that weekend and we were all pissed. We asked her to postpone and she was a massive bitch about it. She's like a mix between Mr Garrison from south park and Crocker from Fairly odd parents. We all had to write essays a 5000 word essay over the weekend. We're only 15 so this is a bit much.  We wrote our essays in Kashubian, it was a class effort that 14/21 people in the class did it.  Someone wrote it in Silesian and someone had their friend who speaks Rusyn to translate it to that language so only 5 essays were in Polish, a language the teacher understands. We turned the essays in on Monday and she was fucking pissed. She actually cried saying we disrespected her and she made us leave the class. We basically just sat in the hallway for 15 minutes until the principal came. He then yelled at us for 20 minutes saying how disrespectful we are and how this hurts and whatever. The people who did it in Polish got a 6 (basically an A) while the rest of us got 1s.\n\nThere was an assembly the next day where the principal talked about integrity and respect to the whole school without mentioning the incident but basically the entire school knew it was about that incident. We all had to rewrite our essays in Polish and write an apology letter. We are all refusing to do that. My parents are on my side, saying the teacher is out of line. Some people's parents have formed a group and are pissed at the school while others are makign their kids comply. We all got talked to individually as well and the principal told me i was a bad student and bad person and whatever.\n\nEDIT: We did this because the teacher is a massive bitch, we wanted to waste her time like she wastes ours. She's such a shit teacher taht she takes up our classtiem from other classes and gives us so much homework for things she should've taught. Rusyn Silesian and Kashubian aren't on google translate so its a pain in hte ass for her to get that translated.

Teens can be hard on teachers but it sounds like your teacher is the AH in this story.\n\nI'm currently studying at the University and I would stress out if I had to write a 5000 word review in 4 days. Btw, if those languages are recognised as official languages within your country it could be that she is forced to accept the assignments as they are.", "If the rules of the assignment or the school don't specify that work must be handed in in Polish, you did nothing wrong and NTA, but if there is such a rule you're on your own.\n\nI admit I giggled at the story, I used similar methods to annoy people in a position of power, and the results can be glorious. That being said, I'm not sure this is the way to improve relations with this teacher. Talk with your parents about this, with the principal or a school counselor and if that doesn't work there's always the strike.\n\nThe most important bit is: do things collectively. Collective punishments don't work if they rain down on all involved. Are there other classes who suffer under this teacher? Get them involved. Write to the local newspaper, use social media. Make the people who employ her work.", "NTA good on you kids for finding a little power and standing together against a power hungry adult.  If possible you all should select someone that's a good speaker and go to the principal explaining why you all did this.  Start documenting examples of her abusing her power and I would even say do it again if this didn't get the message through to her.", "NTA\n\n>She yells at us for stupid reasons, she talks to us about her relationship issues\n\nShe gave you the perfect reason to write her up. Ask your parents to write a complaint and state these issues and warn if the principal does not take any action they will write a formal complaint to the education ministry. Teachers should not talk about their personal issues in class.", "NAH. You had your fun but now you should rewrite the assignment and apologize. \n I get that from your perspective your teacher is being unfair but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. She doesn\u2019t get paid any extra for marking all the homework she gives out so has a harder time than the other teachers. Maybe she is trying to help you to do better in exams with all the extra work? Can you imagine how long it will take her to read 5000 from each of you? \n\nI know you\u2019re the student, so just looking at it from your own point of view, but if I was your parent, I would point out that you made someone cry at work for doing her job and I would ask that you have some empathy. Yes, she is the authority figure but how do you think it feels to have 14 people against you and calling you names behind your back?
