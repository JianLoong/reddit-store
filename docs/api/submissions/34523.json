On this particular day we were quite busy so instead of monitoring the floor I hopped on a register. A woman jumped in line and she had a small Pomeranian in a red service vest sitting in her cart with her. \"Alright, no big deal I'll just make sure to sanitize the cart before after she leaves.\" I'm ringing up groceries and I can hear the dog lowly growling at something, it's me. I ignore it and continue scanning. Once finished she was having issues with her gift card so I needed to come around the counter to assist. Well once I got near the dog it started barking at me. I stepped back and told her she needed to calm her dog down while I manually fixed the issue on the other end of the computer. She informed me that her dog can be nervous and doesn't like new people. Once I finish her transaction I go to hand her the receipt and the dog jumps half way out of the cart and tried to bite me. I drop her card and recipet on the table and told her that she needed to pack her items up and leave. And for future reference her dog wouldn't be allowed back in the store without being properly behaved. She started yelling at me telling me that her dog was a service dog and was allowed to be anywhere she was. She wanted my manager and I got my superior to come over. At this point the dog is shaking and growling as she shuffling to put her groceries in a bag. She tells the manager I am discriminating against her and banned her dog. I explain the dog has been growling and barking at me and tried to bite me. The manager had been hearing barking echoing through the store and knew it was this dog. She was told that her dog wouldn't be allowed back unless she could control it from trying to bite the employees. \nFurther thoughts: I have no idea if this dog was a service animal and didn't think to ask what tasks it was trained for. However, no service dog should be trying to bite people and bark at employees due to safety. She didn't even try to calm her dog down while it was barking. \nAITA for banning a woman's \"service dog\" from the store?", "created_utc": 1704644708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190vtlt/aita_for_banning_a_service_animal_from_the_store/", "score": 1054, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should ignore anything that\u2019s not a threat, such as cats, small animals, random noise-making objects, people, etc. I have a psychiatric service dog that does nothing in public unless someone gets to close, she boops them until they back up. Sometimes, I have to explain to the person they are too close and my dog is executing a task. But, she has never growled or barked.", "NTA - Clearly not an actual service dog and its upsetting to see people behave like that because it puts actual service dogs at risk. There have been multiple instances of service dogs getting injured by aggressive dogs that owners lie about being service dogs. Always remember the two questions you can ask. 1: is the animal required because of a disability and 2: what work or task has the animal been trained to perform. Real people with service animals will happily answer these questions as they know that is allowed and they usually know the answer right away. People with fake service animals will often avoid or not answer these questions and may provide some sort of documentation or vest as proof, but those can be purchased off amazon and mean nothing, plus there is no official documentation needed for a service dog to go somewhere.", "NTA.

Doesn\u2019t sound like a real service dog with real training. You are within your rights to not allow that behavior in a place of business. It\u2019s potentially dangerous, and disruptive to other paying customers.", "NTA. You're definitely not wrong for not allowing that lady's dog in the store. If a dog, even a service one, is growling, barking, and trying to bite, that's a safety issue. You did the right thing by bringing it up.  It's about keeping everyone safe and comfortable.

Businesses may exclude a service animal from the premises if the animal is not housebroken or if the animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it.", "NTA. In the U.S., the law requires the service animal to be \"under the control of the owner\" at all times. A real red flag here (besides the biting, of course), is her statement that her dog \"gets nervous around new people\". A trained service animal has been well socialized from an early age to avoid just such problems. \n\nAlso, just because someone puts a service vest on a dog does NOT mean they are a service animal. Anyone can buy those off the internet.", "NTA, she is happy to put other people's safety at risk, and that's not okay!

A service dog can not be nervous and can not act like this.", "NTA. That wasn't a service dog. You are allowed to ask: \"Is that a service dog?\" and if yes, \"What tasks is it trained to perform?\" (Emotional support does not count. Emotional support animals are just pets, not medical equipment.)\n\nAnd even if it magically is trained to detect low blood sugar or seizure or something, if it's misbehaving you can still ask someone with a service dog to leave the store. Service dogs must be trained to be amongst the public without causing problems.

Nothing illegal about that", "Even service dogs can be banned from a shared location if they aren't able to maintain prosocial behaviors, per the ADA. It doesn't matter if her dog was prescribed or not, it's her job to maintain its training in a way that curbs reactivity and a dog that BITES cannot be allowed in community access again until such time as the dog's reactivity has been trained back to baseline and curbed.\n\nGrowling is an edge case, especially if the dog and owner are being crowded by a stranger, as this can be a legitimate \"warning\" to a stranger to back away from an owner-trainer. But biting is clear and blatant violation of community access training procedure.\n\nNTA - sincerely a Service Dog Owner-Trainer", "Maybe I have to ask myself AITA as well because I feel like you answered the question yourself pretty well because I would kick the dog out as well if he tried to bite me more than once and the owner isn\u2019t doing anything against it.\n\nI would call it a safety issue and bann the dog to protect employees and other customers.\n\nOfc anyone could always be nicer but tbh at the point someone might hurt you it\u2019s time to draw a line.", "NTA. I hate dog owners like that. I have a well behaved non service animal that I can\u2019t take places because of people like her.", "NTA. Service dogs are highly trained and would never act that way. If that dog has any kind of papers, it\u2019s most likely from an online website to be registered as an emotional support pet.

If a service animal mis-behaves, you inform their handler and ask them to control the animal. If they can't control the animal, you can can ask them to leave, while still offering options to complete the transaction. \n\nThat's even assuming it is a service animal. \\*sigh\\*\n\nMy dog served as my service animal for 15 years before passing at the age of 19.

It\u2019s not a real service dog. Service dogs go through extensive training and they don\u2019t try to bite people. \n\nAlso, most service dogs aren\u2019t able to fit in a purse. It sounds like she tried to make her dog like it\u2019s an emotional support animal (which is usually what a tiny dog is, they\u2019re not normally service), and if it is, she has to provide proof.\n\nIn my state, Service animals they do not have to provide proof of what they are and can not be kicked out, but emotional support animals do and can be kicked out of the store.", "NTA, the lady was lying. This was not a service animal as they have a pretty incredible amount of training. You are allowed to ask what service this animal is trained to perform.

It stayed under the table the whole time.  Not a peep from it.", "NTA.  Doesn't matter what the dog is trained to do.  The minute it is not controlled you are able to ban it.", "NTA, almost certainly not a service animal. I have known many, many people who have gotten fake vests or even papers for their dog online from a shady website. It is almost a game at this point. You can't ask for proof that it is a service animal but if it is aggressive it can be banned. I had to throw a guy out of my restaurant once for bringing his \"service\" dog into the kitchen repeatedly and insisting 'service animals can go anywhere', this is not true. Don't fall for their bullshit, service animals still have to behave appropriately and there are reasonable rules about where they can go.

Probably bought that cute little vest online.", "NTA.  Sounds like this lady bought her dog a red vest from Amazon.  Just kick her out next time and don't even mention the dog.", "You are allowed to ask this person what task this dog is trained to do.  Emotional support is not a task.  And if the service dog acts up you are allowed to make it leave.\nThis dog is a danger.  Should not be around people.  Fake service dogs often attack real service dogs.  There is no registry either.\nWe had a similar incident at an anime convention I went to where someone's fake service dog came in and was growling.  They had to make it leave before it bit someone, and the con was sued out of existence.\nNta", "Service animals do NOT do that. NTA, your safety was potentially at risk.

Such an animal would have never passed temperament  assessments with stranger reactivity. They cannot growl, or worse become aggressive, that is an instant fail for many trainers.\n\nBasically you have to allow service dogs that are appropriately trained, key word being appropriately. You don't need to ask her what he does, the minute he lunged he proved he wasn't trained, and therefore is not entitled to the protectikns appropriately trained service animals and their handlers have a right to.\n\nI suspect this another person who brought a vest online so they could take their poorly trained pet everywhere as an \"ESA\".", "This is not a trained service animal. \n\nIt's an emotional support animal and they're not even remotely close to being the same.", "That is not a real service dog.

On this particular day we were quite busy so instead of monitoring the floor I hopped on a register. A woman jumped in line and she had a small Pomeranian in a red service vest sitting in her cart with her. \"Alright, no big deal I'll just make sure to sanitize the cart before after she leaves.\" I'm ringing up groceries and I can hear the dog lowly growling at something, it's me. I ignore it and continue scanning. Once finished she was having issues with her gift card so I needed to come around the counter to assist. Well once I got near the dog it started barking at me. I stepped back and told her she needed to calm her dog down while I manually fixed the issue on the other end of the computer. She informed me that her dog can be nervous and doesn't like new people. Once I finish her transaction I go to hand her the receipt and the dog jumps half way out of the cart and tried to bite me. I drop her card and recipet on the table and told her that she needed to pack her items up and leave. And for future reference her dog wouldn't be allowed back in the store without being properly behaved. She started yelling at me telling me that her dog was a service dog and was allowed to be anywhere she was. She wanted my manager and I got my superior to come over. At this point the dog is shaking and growling as she shuffling to put her groceries in a bag. She tells the manager I am discriminating against her and banned her dog. I explain the dog has been growling and barking at me and tried to bite me. The manager had been hearing barking echoing through the store and knew it was this dog. She was told that her dog wouldn't be allowed back unless she could control it from trying to bite the employees. \nFurther thoughts: I have no idea if this dog was a service animal and didn't think to ask what tasks it was trained for. However, no service dog should be trying to bite people and bark at employees due to safety. She didn't even try to calm her dog down while it was barking. \nAITA for banning a woman's \"service dog\" from the store?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

An attack can lead to our dogs becoming to injured to work or too traumatized to work, and with the sheer amount of work and money that goes into training these dogs, losing them can be just as debilitating for some of us as losing a cane, wheelchair, medication, etc. Service dogs can cost over $40,000, and self training often costs people around $20,000.\n\nI find it unlikely that this was a real service dog, for a few reasons:\n1) SDs are not supposed to go in shopping carts\n2) SDs are not supposed to be aggressive.

Actual SD handlers will always try to redirect their dogs if they\u2019re behaving inappropriately, and will leave on their own if they can\u2019t.\n\nThere is a LOT of misinformation on SDs. It\u2019s very possible that the handler doesn\u2019t understand the difference between an ESA and a SD, or doesn\u2019t understand how trained SDs are supposed to be, so that\u2019s why they brought them with them. It\u2019s also possible that they\u2019re just entitled and decided to lie to being their dog in.\n\nNow, even if this was a real SD who was just having an \u201coff\u201d day, you\u2019re still NTA. SDs can be refused public access if they\u2019re acting inappropriately and the owner is unable or refusing to get them under control.

The persistence of the dog and almost lackadaisical attitude of the handler is not.", "NTA. A service animal usually is trained and stays calm. This wasn\u2019t a real service animal for sure", "Reading the comments, I feel obligated to inform people of the three types of animals who perform services for humans (I\u2019m sure there are more, like dogs who can detect Covid or cancer, etc.). \n\nTier 1: Service animals (mostly dogs). These are highly trained animals who perform actual services for their humans, like guide dogs for the blind, dogs who detect low blood sugar, and more. Training is extensive for both the dog and for the human, who also needs to be trained how to handle the dog and work with it. These are service dogs, the kind that legally must be allowed in most public places. \n\nTier 2: Emotional Support Animals. These dogs are generally owned by their human first, not bred and trained by professionals before being paired w a human. These dogs generally calm a person down if the person has anxiety or another mental health issue. Training varies wildly. Sometimes there is no training. People get their doctors to write a note or sign a form, and they mail it off with a fee to get a vest and some ID cards and certificate, etc. This is the dog OP describes. These dogs may be allowed in housing even if there is a no pet policy. \n\nTier 3: Therapy Animals (often dogs). I am on my second therapy dog. These animals are pets who go through training and need to be certified by an organization authorized to do so. Training usually involves ensuring the dog can pass all the canine good citizen test items, plus some medical facility specifics like not reacting to wheelchairs, walkers, canes\u2026 plus ensuring they can \u201cleave it\u201d or \u201cdrop it,\u201d like if a pill is on the ground. Therapy dogs have no special permission to go in public places (shops, live in no-pet rentals, etc.), except, of course, the places where they provide their services.

From a dog person, you did right.", "NTA - that isn't a service dog, it is an emotional support animal and they are not afforded the same privileges.

They go through quite a lot during training to make sure they stay calm in stressful situations, as they are supposed to assist their owners in certain ways like guiding or sensing if something is medically wrong with them and they need to alert someone nearby.  \nBut the behaviour described does not fit a service dog. Also, so far I've only seem service dogs at a size that's to big to put in a shopping cart. I'm pretty sure that women simply got that vest to carry that dog anywhere for convenience.\n\nAlso, dogs that aren't service dogs are not allowed in most stores and if you have signs on the doors etc. that clearly say dogs aren't allowed in the store, she did it on purpose and broke the store's rules, which is enough to ban her from the store, too.", "NTA.

What does under control mean?  Do service animals have to be on a leash?  Do they have to be quiet and not bark?\n\nA. The ADA requires that service animals be under the control of the handler at all times. In most instances, the handler will be the individual with a disability or a third party who accompanies the individual with a disability. In the school (K-12) context and in similar settings, the school or similar entity may need to provide some assistance to enable a particular student to handle his or her service animal. The service animal must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered while in public places unless these devices interfere with the service animal\u2019s work or the person\u2019s disability prevents use of these devices. In that case, the person must use voice, signal, or other effective means to maintain control of the animal. For example, a person who uses a wheelchair may use a long, retractable leash to allow her service animal to pick up or retrieve items. She may not allow the dog to wander away from her and must maintain control of the dog, even if it is retrieving an item at a distance from her. Or, a returning veteran who has PTSD and has great difficulty entering unfamiliar spaces may have a dog that is trained to enter a space, check to see that no threats are there, and come back and signal that it is safe to enter. The dog must be off leash to do its job, but may be leashed at other times. Under control also means that a service animal should not be allowed to bark repeatedly in a lecture hall, theater, library, or other quiet place. However, if a dog barks just once, or barks because someone has provoked it, this would not mean that the dog is out of control.", "Nta.

Psych service dogs are saving lives just like your med alert is. \nPeople who have SDs that bark or vocalize to alert are certainly facing an uphill battle for public access, because the general public interprets that as aggressive or disruptive behavior rather than tasking. And the majority of the SD community has been taught to avoid those tasks (hell, I was even thought that vocalizing wasn't an appropriate task behavior with my first SD. I've since learned otherwise.) \nAs handlers, it's a big responsibility to advocate for our own needs and educate others, both within and outside of the SD community. Showing up in anger every time someone is misinformed or miscommunicates is exhausting and not sustainable. And it doesn't do our community any favors.", "[deleted]", "It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a service dog - service dogs that behave that way can be kicked out.", "Yes", "Apparently a couple people have thought I was an ass...", "I mean it's very much an \"on your honor\" system (which is good in theory, except that many people have no honor \ud83e\udd37), and the fact that many people do not understand the boundaries and rights regarding service animals means a lot of rights being broken for everyone.
