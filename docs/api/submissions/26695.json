This is a perfect example of gaslighting. Refuse to apologize. What can anyone really do about it? typo", "I don't think there's enough information here to tell. If this was the first time, I think it's a bit of a stretch to jump to stalking, and most people would act defensive about such a major accusation. Now if there's more history, then maybe it makes sense. But this seems a bit extreme unless there's more background since he could've just been getting coffee and happened to leave at the same time. Unless you have a reason to think he wants to intimidate you by showing up where you are, it'd also be a very strange way to stalk someone out of the blue since it's so obvious he's there. I might consider less extreme possibilities if there's no reason before this to think stalking is an issue with him.", "INFO: Did you ask the BIL what happened? I mean, are you sure he wasn't just hanging out with his friends and somebody wanted to go to Starbucks? Are you sure he didn't NOT come over to talk to you because he was trying to give you space? These sound like at least plausible scenarios to me. Has something like this ever happened before? If not, I think you may have levied the \"stalking\" charge WAY prematurely.", "YTA- or mentally ill.  Either way, no an entire group of people who went to a coffee shop and did not even speak to you, but were just minding their business were not stalking you.
