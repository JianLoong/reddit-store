My mother had one for her and her boyfriend at the time, I had my own, and my siblings had to share an air mattress. We went through at least 4 air mattresses because my siblings kept putting holes in theirs and each time I had to share mine which was very aggravating and frustrating.

However, this kept going on till Davion and Jayda put a hole in my air mattress and my mom\u2019s boyfriend gave me one of his that he stored at his parent\u2019s house. \n\nDuring that time, my mother bought Davion and Jayda and new air mattress, and by now you should know how that story went. They punctured both mine \u2014 the mattress my mom\u2019s bf gave me \u2014 and their air mattress.

Of course this was the answer I was expecting, so I didn\u2019t press the issue.\n\nFast forward to now, we live in a much better apartment and my mom is doing better financially. Other than that, everything is still the same. Recently, Davion broke my mother\u2019s tv and instead of punishing him, she took their tv and put it in her room and told me that I would have to let him and my sister use my tv whenever they wanted to. That was my final straw, I told her \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019m not doing that and they can sit and stare at the wall for all I care.
