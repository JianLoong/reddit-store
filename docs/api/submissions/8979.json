He pays me very well, gave me opportunities that I would have never received otherwise, and has helped pay for my education.\n\nHowever, as I have worked here, I have noticed how awful it is.\n\nThe place is littered with safety violations. I have been pushing for new safety equipment from the moment I started as a majority of ours is either damaged or useless or 10 years old. I have met resistance on every front. Managers mock employees for asking to go buy a new safety rope because theirs is damaged. When I have reported it, they have done nothing about it. When I bring up getting new harnesses, it's always \"lets talk about it next week.\" When I ask if I can purchase new first aid kits for company vehicles (because right now there is nothing inside the first aid kits, they're just for show) they say that the employees will just steal them. I was mocked for posting the OSHA 300A log in the shop yesterday because they have never done that in the past.\n\nAs I have mentioned, the owner is very nice, but is the biggest problem within the company as he doesn't have the slightest backbone. I was yelled at for documenting a verbal warning the other day saying I should have gone through him, even though I was just following procedure.\n\nI know it would destroy my family's relationship with theirs if they found out it was me who reported it to OSHA and I would be genuinely surprised if the company survived OSHA really digging into the company. It would be awful and selfish of me to report it, knowing this man's livlihood is at stake here. I genuinely want what is best for him, but the company is risking employee lives daily.\n\nThe company pays me pretty handsomely to keep my mouth shut on these issues and I am probably breaking the NDA I signed by even posting on here, but I don't want to see any other employees get hurt because of what WE aren't doing. I want to see the company succeed, but if we don't start taking safety seriously, either a lawsuit or OSHA will run us into the ground.", "created_utc": 1675369039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rznqz/wibta_for_blowing_the_whistle_on_a_family_friend/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The butchers complained and after a certainly time of day took them off. It increase productivity....well, until someone lost the top of their hand. 4 fingers. Ambulance called. Saw room head manager fired, huge lawsuit. And company got a body cavity search by OSHA. Oh, it gets better: what came up during legal discovery? All the emails from people who tried to alert people it was happening. The fines were horrific. The process was neverending. \n\nYou have a morale obligation to every person in that company to keep them safe. Have a friend not associated with the company call and say they are a worker who thinks the company is providing equipment that could put their lives at risk. The owner and you will just get that high level explanation and it wont come back to you. They will be ORDERED to do it. \n\nBut do something. You will be roasted over the coals if you do not in many ways.", "A nice gentlemen doesn't play with they lives of his employees. What do you mean when you say he doesn't have a backbone?

Too many businesses treat OSHA and other labor laws/best practices like a joke and it's always the employees with the least power that suffer the consequences. If they wanna succeed, then they need to do what they're supposed to do and that includes giving a damn about the safety of every employee.", "Let's put this question another way.\n\nAn employee dies due to the negligence of the company.\n\nYou knew of this negligence and did nothing.\n\nWorse you could have done something, reported it to authorities outside of the company to ensure they start complying at best, or at worst are closed so they don't kill someone.\n\nAre you the AH now\n\nYeah you are \n\nESH this is the responsibility of everyone", "NTA. Just because the owner is \u201cnice\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d. He clearly doesn\u2019t care about his employees\u2019 safety and well-being. You\u2019ll feel like more of an asshole if something happens to an employee in the future. You\u2019re doing the right thing. All the best!", "It's all fun and games until someone dies on the job, and when OSHA comes around to investigate the death, guess who's the highly-compensated safety officer who gets to take responsibility?\n\nThat's right, you. You're also personally liable as the safety officer when you sign off on shit.\n\nThat said, there's a middle ground where you have a serious conversation with the boss about this and outline the consequences of inaction to the company when someone dies or gets seriously injured.\n\nOverall ywnbta for escalating it if they refuse to act.", "NTA\n\nIt's only a matter of time before someone becomes seriously injured. I can't be certain, but there must be a way for you to report OSHA violations anonymously.

Someone could become gravely injured or die if the company is not taking the proper precautions.", "NTA. How is it selfish to be worried about the safety of the employees? It's selfish of the owner to allow this to continue happening.  Why should he be allowed to profit off of the employees putting their lives at risk so he can save a few bucks?\n\nIf there are as many violations as you suggest, it's likely it won't be immediately obvious you're the one who reported them", "NTA. How will you feel when someone is injured because something you've reported internally hasn't been addressed? This guy doesn\u2019t deserve your loyalty.", "NTA, egregious safety violations need to be rectified and if not someone could get hurt or killed and you would be complicit. Obviously it\u2019s the \u201cright\u201d thing to do but it\u2019s your call if you want to blow up your life. Have some other gig lined up before you do so.", "NTA, in fact I'd say every moment you delay reporting ifls putting lives at risk. Is the bribe they are laying you worth that?", "NTA. \n\nIt would be better to report it before something happens, then have something happen and the man possibly be in more trouble.", "You need to report.  Get a new job, warn your family and call OSHA.  This is not about your relationship, it's about his callous attitude towards his work ethics and safety of his employees.  What happens when someone is injured or dies?  Will that be better? Nope, worse.  You should have done this long ago.", "NTA and you can submit a complaint anonymously if you're worried about that", "Report that shit ASAP.\n\nDid an essay on OSHA for an English class. Whistleblowing is protected. If they try and retaliate against you that's a helluva nice lawsuit and I'm willing to bet they're dumb enough to try.\n\nAt this point people's lives are on the line. NTA, OP, but you would be the AH if you decided to let the friendship overwhelm common sense.", "NDAs can't be used against you to cover up illegal activity on the company's part. But if you can't register complaints anonymously, there's likely to be unpleasant repercussions. NTA, but you might want to start looking for a new job.", "NTA. AS someone who works for a company who has lost employees. Imagine looking in the eyes of a family who lost someone due to a preventable measures. There would be an open case anyway once there was a recordable.", "NTA If there are real safety concerns, you are looking out for him and for the other employees. Reimagine how bad it would be if he had several wrongful death/injury suits on his business. Go and report!", "NTA. One thing I would recommend is to put some numbers to what you are saying if you want to try and keep the relationship intact. Can you research how much the fines would be? How much he would pay for injuries and how it would affect his premiums for insurance?  Sometime things like this are out of sight out of mind, not that this excuses the behavior, but if you put some numbers in front of him maybe it will change his mind. The real question you need to ask is what if someone gets hurt and you didn\u2019t say anything?", "YWBTA if you DON\u2019T report this ASAP. Report it anonymously if you have to. It\u2019s not selfish to report safety violations, but it\u2019s selfish not to report them simply because you\u2019re getting paid well to be quiet. \u201cNice guy\u201d isn\u2019t synonymous with \u201cgood employer\u201d. And frankly I don\u2019t find somebody who doesn\u2019t care to keep his employees safe \u201cnice\u201d. If he really cared about his employees\u2019 safety, correcting these safety issues wouldn\u2019t keep getting put off and you wouldn\u2019t keep getting crapped on for trying to talk about them. He is gonna have a lot worse of an issue if somebody is injured or dies due to these violations because OSHA will come down on him even harder for allowing it to happen. And an NDA doesn\u2019t protect them from liabilities like this getting aired. They aren\u2019t given a free pass to break safety laws just because employees signed an NDA.", "NTA\n\nYou would be a tremendous asshole if you didn't.  If someone gets hurt or killed, and you could have stopped it, you're in some part culpable.", "NTA. But before you do this, make sure you try and document that you told him all these things so that way after he gets dinged, he can\u2019t be all \u201cwhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me??\u201d\n\nFar better he get a bunch of fines rather than someone get killed or seriously injured. Then everyone would really be up shit\u2019s creek.", "NTA. Some safety violations are commonplace. But not harnesses and safety lines. That's terrifying.
