You really overreacted and yea definitely humiliated him when your family may have just laughed at his question and not thought much of it. Your response was cruel. He may have forgotten or may not have realized how serious you were when you told him to not bring it up. You could have spoken to him in private and explained again what you need from him and how serious you are, and if it continues correct him in front of others. Honestly even if out loud in front of your family you said something like \u201cdad I already told you that subject makes me uncomfortable and upset and I asked you not to bring it up.

Yes, your father should be more respectful of your wishes. No, that does not excuse vicious cruelty.

You could have chosen to say \"you know that's not something I'm focusing on now\" or \"I don't really like to talk about that sort of thing\" and deflected.

I think you both said hurtful things, but he only said something that made you uncomfortable out of, again, carelessness and forgetfulness. You said what you said out of anger, deliberation, and maliciousness. You both need to apologize.

An adult response would be \"We already discussed this. Please pass the salt.\" Or \"I'm not worrying about that right now. Anyone catch X game?\" Not \"You said something mean so I'm taking everybody down with me!\"", "OP if you want any sympathy here, I think you need to explain why a pretty common/innocuous question infuriates you to the point of being so cruel. \n\nHave family mocked you for being single? Maybe you\u2019re hurting from a recent breakup? Maybe you don\u2019t want to date boys and your family is being homophobic?\n\nThey way you wrote it really does not make your reaction look proportional at all.", "Oooh I love a classic game of he did it first!!\n\nYou're 19, OP. Grow TF up.\n\nYou're likely going to be asked about your relationship status A LOT in life because society still puts a lot of importance on ones relationship status.\n\nLearn how to handle the question and answer gracefully.\n\nYTA.", "so this is like if your dad jokingly lightly shoves you after you told him you didn\u2019t like to be shoved and in retaliation, you punched him and your mom full force in the face", "He may have been wrong for bringing up t he question but you literally insulted both of your parents just to be spiteful", "Yeah I get it. I told my dad to stop calling me a nickname last week. He slipped, so I shot him.", "It doesn't compare.", "How was it hurtful? Are you morning the death of a significant other? That\u2019s the only situation where that question could truly be hurtful. \nIn all other situations it is merely annoying.", "Yeah, I get that part. It doesn't mean you didn't overreact. I think he should have respected your wishes, but you're a teenager and he's your dad. You could've said almost anything else. Including \"why are you asking about that when I asked you not to a whole month ago already?\"", "I have said it before, I will say it again -\n\nJust because you declare something a \"boundary\" like \"I don't want to be asked about relationships\" does NOT mean every way you respond to that boundary being violated is okay.\n\nCase in point the way you responded was NOT okay. \n\nYour father is interested in your life, he maybe forgets sometimes that there are parts of your life you don't want to talk about. He needs to work on that. There are ways to remind him of that without insults. \n\nYTA\n\nAlso OP there is a possibility you need to seek some form of therapy if you can afford it...", "That's a terrible excuse. He probably forgot you'd said anything.", "I\u2019m going to say a soft YTA here - that was a really nasty thing to say, not just about your dad, but also about yourself. Would you ever tell a friend the reason she didn\u2019t have a partner was because she inherited \u201cugly genes\u201d from her parents? No. Then don\u2019t talk about yourself that way. \n\nIt sounds like this is a really sore point for you, not just not having a partner, but also maybe a lack of confidence in the way you look. It was definitely an AH thing to say, and I\u2019d be heartbroken if I were your mum or dad - not just at the attack on your dad, but also to think that you thought that way about yourself. \n\nI know \u201cgo to therapy\u201d gets thrown around on this sub a lot, but if this is truly the way you feel, I think it could be really beneficial for you to talk through your confidence issues with someone. \n\nAnd apologise to your dad. No one is truly ugly, except those with an ugly heart.", "miss girl this is your FATHER. Show some respect.", "Her vocabulary/grammar skill seem very limited", "Time for her to consider that maybe it's her stunning personality that's keeping her from having a bf...", "Her mom got hit with a stray with this one because wth did she do wrong for that insult", "Genuine question, why did you post this if you think you were right and when told otherwise you get defensive?", "INFO: Do you still live at home with your parents? If you do, do you still expect to live with them after this incident?", "Yes, this.  Appropriate response.  Equal force.\n\nNot ballistic and vengeful.", "This.\nThere's a difference behind the motives of his comments compared to yours.\nJeesh. YTA.", "she also insulted herself and siblings too. she tossed a nuke out there", "What does being a teenager have to do with the situation?", "Very few people have ever accused husbands and fathers of being good listeners after all\u2026 \nThere are always exceptions, but it most likely went in one ear and out the other, and he was searching for topic change at dinner", "Well obviously she was looking for others to agree, now that she's found it she feels justified lmao", "I think only YTA because she mentioned her mom, not for being rude to he dad .", "Some parents are much more likely to tease their young/teenage children rather than ones who are out of their teens and more adult. He may or may not have said or done this had his child been older, so age may have played a factor in his behavior.\n\nMind you, this assumes the dad in this situation fully intended to tease and didn't simply forget. I can see either way, particularly since my dad would often do or say things like that to rib me, then claim it was a joke if I took any umbrage. As I am now much older, he doesn't really do that anymore.", "Exactly, she's nearly in her 20s", "Lmao, I love when people do this too because they get absolutely destroyed in the comments, it's so funny.", "Very well put, good sir."]}
