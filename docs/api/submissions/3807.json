He may have forgotten or may not have realized how serious you were when you told him to not bring it up. You could have spoken to him in private and explained again what you need from him and how serious you are, and if it continues correct him in front of others. Honestly even if out loud in front of your family you said something like \u201cdad I already told you that subject makes me uncomfortable and upset and I asked you not to bring it up.

Yes, your father should be more respectful of your wishes. No, that does not excuse vicious cruelty.

You could have chosen to say \"you know that's not something I'm focusing on now\" or \"I don't really like to talk about that sort of thing\" and deflected.

I think you both said hurtful things, but he only said something that made you uncomfortable out of, again, carelessness and forgetfulness. You said what you said out of anger, deliberation, and maliciousness. You both need to apologize. He should apologize for how him asking you that around family made you uncomfortable and awkward and you should also apologize for being deliberate and malicious with what you said to him because you probably made him feel like shit.\n\nEdit: I predicted my downvotes lol!

Yeah it was rude, but damn, you already asked dad to not ask anymore.   After your reply, I guarantee he won\u2019t ask again.  Lol.

It's not hard in a situation like this to make it clear that you want to have your own boundaries respected. You can even do it without being a total jerk. Instead you went nuclear, and are falling back on an excuse a toddler would use...'he did it first!'. Give me a break.\n\nHonestly, it wouldn't hurt to consider getting some counseling to learn how to set your own boundaries without being really nasty just because you're annoyed.
