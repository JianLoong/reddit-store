What self respecting person ditches their kids, their partner, and their life like this?

He doesn\u2019t get to hop into a fantasy world on the weekend leaving you with no rest, no break, and no fucking help. \n\nCall his bluff. If he wants to kick it with the homies so much, he can kick it on their couch. Pack his shit, drop it off over there, and return him to the streets from where he came.
