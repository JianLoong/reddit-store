As a teacher, I see a lot of different states of parent-child trust. You did the right thing.\n\nThat said, if this happens repeatedly, then you should tell your husband. A child making a mistake like that once is entirely understandable, but that trust can't be turned into an excuse for developing substance abuse.\n\nThis sounds like a scary situation. Glad that everyone came out okay!", "INFO: \n\nDoes your husband know that you've told the girls that you would help them out of an unsafe situation with no questions asked, no judgements made?\n\nIf so, did he agree with that stance previously?\n\nAnd lastly, is he likely to pass judgement or ask questions of his daughter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom what you've said, your deal didn't include not telling her father, but that aspect may be implied if he is likely to overstep the bounds of the help with no questions/no judgement agreement.", "The important thing is that she's safe and had the good sense to call you. Did the two of you have a talk once she sobered up? I would hope your husband would have the same \"You're safe and that's what's most important\" attitude you do, but is there some fear on your or her part that he'd fly off the handle? I get that you're stuck between a rock and a hard place, as you're either betraying your marriage or your stepdaughter's confidence, but whatever you decide to do it's going to be worse the longer you wait. I'd have a talk with your stepdaughter and encourage her to tell her dad or let you tell him, unless there are serious concerns for either of your safety. \n\nAlso, while \"no questions, no judgements\" is what you want foremost the night of so she's not afraid to call and possibly endanger herself further by trying to go it on her own, there should be SOME consequence for underage drinking. Not dire if she's generally a good kid and this a first offense, like extra chores for a week or she loses her phone or doesn't get to go to the next big event she was looking forward to. Get creative, but a balance has to be struck, it can't be \"I was too drunk for consequences\" every time this happens. Good luck.", "Nta\n\nYou did something she trusted you with. \nNow, when it's starting to become a habit, that's something else. But one time? \nAnd by habit, I mean developing an alcohol problem. Not her calling you when she goes out and finds herself in certain situations.\n\nTeens do teen things, and drinking/crossing boundaries is part of that.\n\nShe called you in her time of need, and you came through. That's amazing! Love that for her and you. \n\nI wish more parents would have your approach.", "NTA. I had the same agreement with my stepkid, and will go to my grave with her secrets.

If so, then I think you need to talk to him and rethink why you think your deal with the girls implies you won\u2019t. \n\nIf not, and you have reason to believe he will react in a counterproductive way that will undermine the long-term trust and safety of the girls, then you\u2019re making the right call for now. But you need to figure out how to address the gap in your approaches now, before anything else happens. Because while lots of people are saying \u201ctell him if it happens again,\u201d you can be sure that conversation will go extremely poorly if you\u2019ve kept it secret once or twice and then tell later. You need to get ahead of that and talk about your deal with the girls, why you have it, and try to get on the same page now.", "NTA, and as others have written, it's okay to keep some things private. It's absolutely fine and helps build the relationship as her safety is most important. However, if there is a 2nd time you should speak to your husband about it.

It's a tough one. I would encourage her to talk to her dad though.", "I'm going to say no. YOU made the right choice by telling your daughter and stepdaughter you would pick them no questions asked. Well apart from where to get them. Your stepdaughter made the right choice in calling you and taking up your offer. If this becomes a regular occurrence you should speak with dad.

Basically the agreement you made with your daughters. *But* part of it was \"no judgments or lectures while doing the pickup, discussions are done the next day\" because parents still have to parent. That's where I think your agreement comes short.\n\nYour stepdaughter should sit down and talk to her dad about what happened, with you there as support. You telling your husband yourself would be a violation of her trust but he still needs to know as the other parent in the household. The only answer is to have her tell him herself. (Unless his response is something to be feared, but then there's bigger problems, obv.)\n\nIt's a delicate balance that needs to be found between keeping the girls' trust but also allowing for parenting to happen. Doesn't need to be a dramatic talk, but having a serious one about the risks your step-daughter took getting that drunk and sneaking out. \n\nBest of luck! As the mom that brought in a step-parent who was amazing for my daughter, thank you for treating your girls equally and being there for your step-kid. That's *amazing* and lovely.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Why does he not inspire the same level of trust that you've earned? She should have been calling YOU BOTH. If you re driving wedges, you are the AH, but if he's not a responsible parent, he is the AH. There's no explanation either way here, but if I was as close the the situation as you are I would definitely have questions.\n\nFor reference, my parents were both my call when a friend was being arrested. Years later when I was drinking at a bar, my father was my call (mother was already dead). He was nicer than she was, but I would not have doubted for a second that I was better off for having them with me.", "I have really bad parents, but they made the same promise to me (63M) and my sister and kept it. I remember be woken one night when I was about 18 to come with my father to go collect my sister. When we got there she was sitting on the curb throwing up into a storm drain. I drove my mother's car home (which my sister had driven) and my father drove my sister home. No yelling and the only \"punishment\" was that my sister had to clean out the car where she threw up in it. \n\nNTA. \n\nWhether you chose to tell your husband or not depends on your relationship and whether he signs up for your \"always call me\" policy. We can't tell you because we don't know. For whatever it's worth, I think your policy is a good one. Good parenting.", "NTA. But unless your husband is a massive AH, encourage her to tell him herself.\n\nBack in the 90s, our then tween daughter was spending NYE with her slightly older cousin and said cousin\u2019s 16 year old step aunt. Step aunt persuaded the two of them to try cigarettes. I could smell it as soon as we picked her up, and had a word when we were alone. She begged me not to tell her dad, and I agreed, but said she shouldn\u2019t be afraid to admit it to him. Sure enough, the next day she told him everything, and he reacted perfectly. Decent parents have been there themselves and understand that youngsters do stupid things, but also that trust is incredibly important.\n\noh, for the record, I\u2019m a lifelong non-smoker because both my parents died young and cigarettes were involved in my mum\u2019s death and directly responsible for my dad\u2019s. Hubby comes from a family of heavy smokers and is an ex smoker himself.", "Don\u2019t violate your trust. You made deal stick with it.  You probably saved her from more harm than you know.

My advice would be to try to have your stepdaughter tell her father and then get together with girls and tell them that while the same bargain applies you will not be keeping secrets from your husband.", "Ask her to tell him, so that it doesn't ever \"come out\" and feel like a lie between you.

Real reasons, real talk.)\n\nBut no, you don't tell him.\nBut if she doesn't, and it ever comes up and he's mad you remind him the absolute obvious: \nYou wanted her to know she can trust you to get her out of an unsafe situation, no matter what, and make sure she's okay.  If he wants her to call you *the next time*, he needs to respect that and/or become that person for her. \n\nI'd rather my partner give my kid a pass I wouldn't on doing something I disapprove of, than have my kid not call for help when they need it, and wind up in *real* trouble.", "NTA - keep it from dad UNLESS it becomes a regular thing or if you are worried she could have a problem.", "If I was her father I would be happy my kid was safe but also not happy (i.e. very mad at you) about being left out of my daughter's life. If he ever finds out, a level of trust will be irreparably breached. I think honesty is the best policy. \"No questions asked\" doesn't mean you'll keep all their secrets forever, just that you will bail them out in that moment. The father has a right to know.", "Yes you are.", "INFO: what would you want to know if he picked up your daughter?", "Is your step daughter trusting you more important than your husband trusting you?\n\nWhat do you think will happen when he eventually finds out that his child was in a potentially very dangerous situation, that you knew about and didn't tell him? You can make this kind of arrangement with your own child but you cannot make it with someone else's unless you seek their permission first. Your step daughter is a minor and you are not her parent or legal guardian. This just isn't your call to make and you should have never made the promise in the first place.\n\nAlso, I've been in family law a long time and get to see first hand the results of this kind of teenage stupidity. These deals do not make it less likely something bad will happen. When your child behaves badly they should be punished and the idea that if you punish them they won't call for help is just wrong. As long as the way you deal with these issues is reasonable and consistent they will call for help. It's fear of your reaction that stops them calling, if your reaction is reasonable (eg they will need to mow the lawn hungover the next day or have to scrub the bathroom) they will call. \n\nI tell my teen daughters not that they won't get into trouble - they will be in trouble - but that I will always come to their rescue regardless of the situation, and I will always be level headed and reasonable when dealing with the situation. I then back this up with consistent and reasonable discipline in all other aspects of our family lives so they trust I will be reasonable in other situations.\n\nDon't lie by ommission to your husband about his child. Apologize to your stepdaughter for making the promise in the first place then give her the opportunity to tell her father before you do. Also maybe privately discuss with your husband reasonable responses to these issues. She was foolish not bad and your husbands response should reflect the foolishness of the action.", "NTA.

However, if he does care, I assume this is going to really bother him when/if he finds out.

My husband had already gone to bed, and I smelled weed coming from her room. I knocked on her door, and told her I just wanted to talk. I approached the situation from a place of concern, instead of punitively. In the past when she\u2019d gotten caught smoking there was always a punishment. But as a recovering addict, I recognized that she wasn\u2019t being a rebellious teenager; she was self medicating. So I used it as an opportunity to connect with her and let her know that I was concerned about her, instead of being angry or disappointed. I made a deal with her that I wouldn\u2019t tell her dad or her mom if she would agree to sit down with me for a real conversation the next day (she was way too stoned that night to process at the time). She did, and we had a good talk.\n\nThe thing about this situation that made me feel ok about it is that I knew that her mom and my husband would have both been ok with it.

The problem is that she was drunk... and addressing things with someone drunk typically has limited effect.  Now that she is sober you should again address this with her - not as a lecture, but as a comment on your concerns.  Be very blunt about the things that could have happened and that it is very possible, being that drunk, that she might find herself in a situation where she was prevented from calling for help and ask her to think about how she would have dealt with it then.  Thank her for trusting you and make it clear that her trust is valuable to you and you will do your best to honour it, but also make it clear that if the day comes when protecting that trust means risking her life and safety you may have to make other choices.\n\nDone as a conversation/communication you can absolutely pull this off.

Though most likely done unintentionally, she's tarnishing the relationship between father and daughter by making them feel like it's safer to go to her than the both of them.\n4. She's choosing to unilaterally decide how to parent the kids. There's something very narcissistic about that. To do that is to believe that your way is the correct way, and so you don't need to discuss this with your partner.

Who would her actions be wrong towards? Her husband. So, yes I do think this makes her a horrible partner.
