You're just asking him to move to another room/space in the house. If your partner keeps avoiding it, I'd tell him that if he doesn't ask, or get little brother to ask, you'll talk to the friend yourself. If the friend is as good as they say he is, then he shouldn't have a problem with it. \n\ntldr; you are doing absolutely nothing wrong asking for space in the same area as you for your incoming baby.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is an owner, not a tenant.  And the friend is just a temporary tenant.  There's clearly going to be too many people upstairs, because it doesn't make any sense to move the nursery to a different level of the house.  The friend should move to a different level or (here's a thought) maybe make a more permanent housing arrangement for himself.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to push this issue himself though, as the property owner.  If he won't do that, then he's failing as a boyfriend.  You two aren't engaged yet, and he's already failing as a boyfriend?  Not sure what that would mean, but YOU should think about it.  Seriously.", "So I\u2019m going to say NTA on the fact that your boyfriend offered him the basement originally, the friend asked to go to the upstairs room instead and he felt to bad to say no. I\u2019ve been in similar situations on both sides but I believe your boyfriend is TA if he doesn\u2019t say something. From what I\u2019m getting it seems like he may be avoiding it because it\u2019ll be an uncomfortable situation, hence why he felt to bad to say no. \nBut even with this opinion I will say take the time to sit and think if this is something within yourself as well. I say that only due to the family comment, you knew he bought this house with his brother beforehand yet feel some way about starting a life with them in the house.", "NTA. Have you already moved in? If not, set the boundary that you won\u2019t while this guy is still on the same floor.  That\u2019s not a sustainable model.   \n\nThe fact that your boyfriend is already saying well for the first year baby will be in our room all the time is worrisome.  Because they won\u2019t be.

Maybe he\u2019s a pushover, maybe he\u2019s prioritizing his friend or brother over you, it\u2019s hard to tell, but either way it ends up screwing you over so it\u2019s an asshole move regardless.\n\nI hope things work out, OP.

You have months to find an accommodation for this, so you\u2019re a bit of an A for that.

He seems like he won't do what's best for your family if it makes him slightly uncomfortable. He doesn't seem like father material and this obviously wasn't planned.", "He's 35 and would rather live with his brother and his brother's friend than you and the unplanned baby. The relationship is SUPER new, and you're a decade younger than him. Chances are He's not your forever, but that baby is. So do what's best for the kid, which is probably you living separately until dad can grow up, or one of you moves on.", "Absolutely NTA. \nAnd your boyfriend as not spine. Is he really thinking in having a family living as a FRIEND character? The friend should move with the couple who hasn't a kid, or the basement. Actually this suggestions should come from him or he should get the hint that it's going to be crowded. A baby is not joke, they basically take all the spots in the house.", "I know it's scary as a first time mum, but regardless of the friend situation, try to keep baby in your room for some time. SIDS is a fucking scary thing and happens for literally no reason.\n\nNTA and good luck with your happy suprise baby", "NTA.  \nIf I was you and have a resources, I would rent an apartment/studio.  \np.s. I do not consider friend/roommate to be an AH either.", " NTA", "NTA. Friend should even notice himself that it would be weird? Less space? Baby noises? Etc....\nAnd why doesn't want the friend to have the whole basement to himself? Is he afraid of the dark? Just trying to make sense out of it.", "I suspect that reality is coming like a freight train for all of you, but especially you. When the baby arrives, it won't give a crap about keeping the peace. It'll be up at all hours of the night, and if it does go to sleep, any noise made in your five person house will wake it up. I'm guessing that the burden of dealing with a cranky baby that's awake at 3am is going to fall mostly to you. (I really hope I'm wrong.)\n\nSuggesting putting the baby's nursery in the living room is insane. The whole house would have to go into lock down every time the baby is napping. Literally \"don't open the front door or you'll wake the baby\" kind of lock down. That's not feasible. It's only marginally less insane to not have a nursery at all. (And yes it's true that it's much easier to keep the baby in your own room for the first six months, but having the nursery gives you flexibility in a way that keeping the entire operation in one room doesn't.) Also, goodbye to your sex life if there's no place to put the baby other than your room.\n\nAnd you're going to be walking around with your boobs hanging out, initially bleeding goops of blood, sleep deprived, and possibly suffering from postpartum depression. If you don't kill any of these happy-go-lucky peeps in a blind fit of rage it'll be a miracle. Good luck. Kids are awesome but they are also the ultimate no-sleep-no-rest curveball of life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. OP, rethink if you want to live in such an environment. In case of any disagreement in the house, you\u2019re on your own, and your boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem like the type that will stand up to his brother and his girlfriend or their friend for you.", "NTA - present the option and if the roommate declines he declines\u2026.he\u2019ll not decline when baby is up to all hours screaming the house down\u2026he\u2019ll be glad of the distance in the basement!", "I know people like this, who avoid conflict with every way they can. They would rather keep doing the same old than do something about it, and its frustrating. The guy is probably not gonna stay there for life, i dont get why he would not just move to other room if the owner asks to especially because its about the owners girlfriend and their baby", "I'd be more irritated in a bedroom so close to a baby who doesn't sleep through the night. I'd probably appreciate the heads up and suggestion to move to the basement of find somewhere else", "On top of all that, I\u2018m sure OP having to regularly traverse two floors while still recovering from childbirth is gonna be just fine and not potentially result in additional complications! /s", "NTA\n\nAnyone suggesting that OP can live in their bedroom with the baby or set up the living room as a nursery for however long is absolutely clueless. Is she just supposed to accept the possibility of the brothers friend (a stranger) walking in on her breastfeeding at whatever time. Also, sometimes the only way to calm the baby down is to walk back and forth through the house and give them different things to look at. And as for the basement... as other people have already stated, the strain walking up and down the stairs and the OP's healing pelvic area, it's just not good.\n\nINFO:\nDoes your boyfriend want to keep him up there to help cover his portion of the mortgage? This could be a monetary thing and he actually avoiding talking to you about his financial situation.", "NTA. Don\u2019t move in if he refuses to have the guy move to the basement.", "NTA but you do not know someone after 6 months.", "NTA... you need to get both your boyfriend and his brother in on the conversation before you move in. A baby changes everything and the brother (and his girlfriend) are going to be involved. They should get some say, but honestly, how does a friend trump a baby that the boyfriend supposedly wants to have in his life? Get this handled quickly and explore all your options.", "NTA. I think your bf has no business becoming a father.", "yta", "NTA but you will be if you bring a child into this mess. For the love of God, just get an abortion and wait until you actually have a stable long term relationship before having kids. This will not last. You will end up a single mum. This guy obviously isn't ready to have kids / deal with the consequences of his actions, which also explains why he's dating someone much younger. It's not too late. Don't ruin your life.", "ESH if you're actually planning to have the baby. If you're only two months in, you still have time to get an abortion..I think that is 100% the only way to go. You would be incredibly stupid and selfish to go forward with the pregnancy.\n\nIf you have an abortion you'd be NTA. But you'd be an awful parent so you'd 100% be TA if you don't get an abortion.\n\nYou're also acting very entitled by dictating what someone else does with a house that you didn't buy. If you'd like to dictate how a house is used, unfortunately, you need to get up off your lazy bum, get a job, earn money, and buy a house of your very own \ud83d\ude0d", "In all honesty, if I was the friend I would prefer to move further away from the baby. Nothing personal, I just wouldn\u2019t want to subject myself to all the inevitable crying", "You know that everyone who has intercourse, even 'safe',can make a baby? \nJudging someone when accidentally got pregnant while all of us can make an accidental baby?", "He wants to avoid conflict and damaging friendship but have no problems damaging your relationship.\n\nAlso OP, it\u2019s hard to navigate stairs as your pregnancy progress. Two flights of stairs for toys and baby things, even postpartum, is only okay if husband will be the one getting them EVERY TIME you need them.", "Honestly, this. I love kids. I do *not* love losing sleep. Put me in the basement, away from the inevitable squalling of an infant at 3 am, I'll manage. I have the ability to move spaces. The baby does not. So if I can move to a different room/ party of the house, I will do so.", "Honestly, stay in your own apartment. Starting a family in a shared house is a bad idea, and worse when your partner is prioritizing others confort to yours", "*he's not leaving his brother*\n\nOP are you ready to co-parent with someone who isn't ready to be a father?  That's the real question here.", "Have you ever lived on your own? Do you currently live with parents or on your own? I understand it\u2019s an unplanned pregnancy\u2026. And the situation isn\u2019t ideal. However if you have a place of your own as of now\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be best for you to stay put? I in your situation would rather do that than share a space with this many people. \nLife is throwing a curve ball at him, he\u2019s a shared new home owner with another person, so trying to move in with him, asking him to shuffle living set ups around so you can start a new family with him when you barely started dating him 6 months ago it\u2019s bananas.", "It's recommended, but it's also perfectly fine to move an infant to their own room as long as you follow the safe sleep ABCs. If they're alone in their crib (no blankets, pillows, bumpers, or toys with the exception of a pacifier), and are put to sleep on their back, it's extremely safe to have them in a separate room. And if you give them a pacifier, that reduces the risk of SIDS even further.", "Changing table? Definitely where baby sleeps.", "Its also really useful to have all of that stuff in one central location though... we keep the crib, the changing table, clothes, playpen and playmat, toys and the sterilizer (plus a mini fridge) in the nursery and it's been very helpful. I wouldn't dismiss it as nonsense.", "It\u2019s not his place. The prospective  dad should tell him move down or move out as is his right as owner", "It happened twice!?!? (pregnancies, indicates it was not twins who were both lost in an accident) I understand tragic accidents happen. Repeating the avoidable circumstances that led to the death of your child is negligent.", "They\u2019ve been together 6 months and she is 2 months pregnant.", "NTA You can\u2019t have the babies room in the basement or living room with your room further away. Your partner needs to put you and the baby first, not this random friend of a friend. Ask him outright who he\u2019s picking then have the conversation together with the roommate.", "Nta but do not move in with this dude until it's sorted. He can't have a slightly uncomfortable conversation? Wtf is he going to do when the baby is here, crying at 2am and the friend is upset about being woken up?\n\nPersonally, if my room mate says, hey my preggo gf is moving in but you can stay in the fully furnished basement instead, I'd be like, great let's move my stuff.

I mean, he knows you are not comfortable living with this stranger and are likely to say No to move in as is so this is his chicken-$hit way of staying separated longer until he\u2019s ready?! Dunno, seems suspicious\u2026", "NTA but you do seriously need to get that IUD out since it can cause birth defects/miscarriages or sepsis \n\n\nI'd honestly reconsider actually having this kid with this man anyway, I feel like he's showing his true colors and your future life with him", "Get ready to do all of the emotional labor now. This is going to carry over to every aspect of your life together. He should do it. And you shouldn\u2019t have to.", "Seriously. I would be moving to the nice basement away from the baby so fast."]}
