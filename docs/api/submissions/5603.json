My bf offered him the basement initially (it\u2019s a nice one and it\u2019s common for people to live in bsmts around this area, my bf was living in one prior to moving to the house) but then he asked him if he could rather take one of the rooms upstairs which my bf felt bad to say no.\n\nThey\u2019ve been living this way for a couple of months and then we realized I\u2019m pregnant, so my bf asked me to move in with him which I agreed, but told him they should speak with their friend to either move to the basement or to the room downstairs that is used as a wardrobe and move those things to the basement cause we will need that extra room for a nursery and all the baby stuff\u2026 and at least have some privacy by having the upstairs floor for us. \n\nHe initially agreed and said he was going to talk with him or let his brother do it (his brother considers this friend as family) then he started avoiding it, and when I asked him what happened with it\u2026 he just told me we could put the toys and baby stuff in the basement, or that he could take the living room couch out and we could do the nursery there. That this guy was very kept to himself and the baby was going to be most of the time in our room for the first year anyways. That he was going to talk with him and see if he was willing to move but if he didn\u2019t wanted then we could live like this. He said as well that it wasn\u2019t as easy like kicking him out and that he was paying rent. I said we weren\u2019t kicking him out, cause he had at least 6 months before the baby is here to decide, and I offered to cover that rent if that was the issue.\n\nI told him that I didn\u2019t felt comfortable living that way, that the living room was the living room and we weren\u2019t going to transform it into a nursery, and that it was already kinda uncomfortable to have to share the house with his brother and girlfriend while initiating our own family, let alone sharing the same floor with his friend.\n\nAITA for wanting this space just for ourselves\n\n\nUPDATE: thanks for so many replies, I wanted to get some perspective as this is something running in my mind 24/7 and I wanted to know if it was me the one making it bigger than what it is.

You're just asking him to move to another room/space in the house. If your partner keeps avoiding it, I'd tell him that if he doesn't ask, or get little brother to ask, you'll talk to the friend yourself. If the friend is as good as they say he is, then he shouldn't have a problem with it. \n\ntldr; you are doing absolutely nothing wrong asking for space in the same area as you for your incoming baby.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is an owner, not a tenant.  And the friend is just a temporary tenant.  There's clearly going to be too many people upstairs, because it doesn't make any sense to move the nursery to a different level of the house.  The friend should move to a different level or (here's a thought) maybe make a more permanent housing arrangement for himself.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to push this issue himself though, as the property owner.  If he won't do that, then he's failing as a boyfriend.  You two aren't engaged yet, and he's already failing as a boyfriend?  Not sure what that would mean, but YOU should think about it.  Seriously.", "So I\u2019m going to say NTA on the fact that your boyfriend offered him the basement originally, the friend asked to go to the upstairs room instead and he felt to bad to say no. I\u2019ve been in similar situations on both sides but I believe your boyfriend is TA if he doesn\u2019t say something. From what I\u2019m getting it seems like he may be avoiding it because it\u2019ll be an uncomfortable situation, hence why he felt to bad to say no. \nBut even with this opinion I will say take the time to sit and think if this is something within yourself as well. I say that only due to the family comment, you knew he bought this house with his brother beforehand yet feel some way about starting a life with them in the house.", "NTA. Have you already moved in?

Sounds like he\u2019s also trying to say let\u2019s keep the baby from bothering this guy.  \n\nIf he\u2019s unwilling to ask the guy to move to the basement which was the ORIGINAL plan all along, then he never will.  He will always for some reason put this guy first.", "**NTA**, you\u2019re doing the right thing in trying to enforce this boundary early because it\u2019s just going to get harder to do once you\u2019re already moved in and settled. Your BF on the other hand is an asshole for not backing you up here. Maybe he\u2019s a pushover, maybe he\u2019s prioritizing his friend or brother over you, it\u2019s hard to tell, but either way it ends up screwing you over so it\u2019s an asshole move regardless.\n\nI hope things work out, OP.

You should take this as a sign for how he'll fail to stand up/do what's best for your growing family in the future.", "If it damages the friendship, he wasn\u2019t much of a friend to begin with. Owner's kid's needs trump renter's wants. Every time. NTA, and do it ASAP!", "So that guys feelings is more important than you and the child he helped create? \n\nEither he is lying about who actually owns the house OR you are a lesser priority than some dude. This is a pretty big indicator of how he will treat you and the baby in the future. I suggest you actually think really hard about whether this is really the guy you want to be stuck with for a lifetime", "Then he can stay with his brother....without his child", "To sleep. Not for most of the time, which is what it sounds like BF was saying.", "Sounds like either way, OP is going solo already.", "O.P. please point out to your boyfriend that he is prioritizing his friend's feelings OVER yours. (If you have not already done so). Has he already had a conversation with his brother/ the friend? It sounds like they might have sided together against him.", "He isnt conflict avoidant. He is misogynistic. He values men and not women (i.e. YOU).", "Your boyfriend has told you that he would prefer you to be uncomfortable (during your pregnancy no less) for some unknown period until the friend decides that *his* comfort matters more to him.    Think about that.   If this is how your boyfriend feels when you are at one of the most vulnerable times of your life -- that your discomfort can be disregarded because it's only \"temporary\" -- what makes you think he will ever prioritize either you or his child.  \n\nThat's not something you want to enable, not at all.", "You\u2019re pregnancy was a mistake OP and he\u2019s making that VERY apparent to you right now. Please take the hint if he proceeds to put his brother and friends above you as a priority. \n\nBecause as you continue to ask him to do the bare minimum for both you and child\u2019s sake; he WILL hold it against you in the future. Keep this in mind when he resents you later. \n\nThis will most definitely be downvoted but I would reconsider the baby or think about adoption for said baby. If not then prepare incase as this is looking like you will be a single parent.\n\n*edit: sentence grammar", "Here's the thing: You are less than 6 months into this relationship.  Under normal circumstances, you would still be learning about each other and gradually adapting to different perspectives.   You're now scrambling to skip over that and jumping into making a family.  That's unlikely to be successful without some intentional work.   He doesn't get to just define family as who he lives with, the relationship matters and he's stomping all over that. \n\nIf you move in with him right now (with or without this extra guy), you are likely to feel trapped and the eventual breakup will be damaging to you, him, and the baby.  Your primary focus right now should be your baby and that is more important that getting your boyfriend on board.   Move to your own place and start counseling asap.  That way you can work on building your relationship with him from a place of peace and comfort.", ">I have to raise this baby on my own place which he completely refuses to. \n\nHow does that work?   How does he prevent a grown woman from living on her own?   Is he saying that if you don't move in with him he won't have anything to do with you or the baby, that he will abandon you completely?   How is that supposed to make you want to move in with him?\n\nThe relationship was great until the two of you had to take it to the next step and prioritize someone else.   Your boyfriend is not doing well in that respect.   You probably want to get yourself into individual counseling asap to help you avoid being pressured into doing something that would be against your self-interest.   If marriage really ~~is~~ was a possibility, he needs some counseling on his own too.", "Please take IcyWheel's comment to heart OP. Your boyfriend doesnt care about you.", "I was actually referring to the boyfriend as being dense but OK.", "Thanks for this perspective, you\u2019re right.", "I know he will hold it against me 100% if I decide I rather be in a place of my own, so I\u2019m willing to move in with him, but I feel at least I should have a saying about how I want my living situation to look like. \nRight now is either I move in like this, putting my comfort and needs aside, or I\u2019m the bad guy for wanting to raise my child without his father living in the same home.", "Is it possible that bf's brother is the only owner?  That's who seems to be making all the decisions.", "And that is why I asked that question. To me, that is a bigger issue than the roommate being upstairs. Good luck and remember, you are signing up to raise a child with this person. I honestly think you should think about that and the implications.", "So he refuses to compromise and blackmails you AND doesnt care about your feelings? This dude is an abuser OP. It will only get worse. Do not move in with him.", "That\u2019s why I feel so strongly about this and wanted to have some perspective because it does affected the way I see him, and I wanted to know if it was just me making it bigger of what it really was"]}
