You're just asking him to move to another room/space in the house. If your partner keeps avoiding it, I'd tell him that if he doesn't ask, or get little brother to ask, you'll talk to the friend yourself. If the friend is as good as they say he is, then he shouldn't have a problem with it. \n\ntldr; you are doing absolutely nothing wrong asking for space in the same area as you for your incoming baby.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is an owner, not a tenant.  And the friend is just a temporary tenant.  There's clearly going to be too many people upstairs, because it doesn't make any sense to move the nursery to a different level of the house.  The friend should move to a different level or (here's a thought) maybe make a more permanent housing arrangement for himself.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to push this issue himself though, as the property owner.  If he won't do that, then he's failing as a boyfriend.  You two aren't engaged yet, and he's already failing as a boyfriend?  Not sure what that would mean, but YOU should think about it.  Seriously.", "So I\u2019m going to say NTA on the fact that your boyfriend offered him the basement originally, the friend asked to go to the upstairs room instead and he felt to bad to say no. I\u2019ve been in similar situations on both sides but I believe your boyfriend is TA if he doesn\u2019t say something. From what I\u2019m getting it seems like he may be avoiding it because it\u2019ll be an uncomfortable situation, hence why he felt to bad to say no. \nBut even with this opinion I will say take the time to sit and think if this is something within yourself as well. I say that only due to the family comment, you knew he bought this house with his brother beforehand yet feel some way about starting a life with them in the house.", "NTA. Have you already moved in? If not, set the boundary that you won\u2019t while this guy is still on the same floor.  That\u2019s not a sustainable model.   \n\nThe fact that your boyfriend is already saying well for the first year baby will be in our room all the time is worrisome.  Because they won\u2019t be.  Maybe a couple weeks, but you will want them to have a nighttime routine in their own room, their own space for all their stuff\u2026you will not want to keep going to the basement for baby\u2019s stuff\u2026wtf?   Sounds like he\u2019s also trying to say let\u2019s keep the baby from bothering this guy.  \n\nIf he\u2019s unwilling to ask the guy to move to the basement which was the ORIGINAL plan all along, then he never will.  He will always for some reason put this guy first.", "**NTA**, you\u2019re doing the right thing in trying to enforce this boundary early because it\u2019s just going to get harder to do once you\u2019re already moved in and settled. Your BF on the other hand is an asshole for not backing you up here. Maybe he\u2019s a pushover, maybe he\u2019s prioritizing his friend or brother over you, it\u2019s hard to tell, but either way it ends up screwing you over so it\u2019s an asshole move regardless.\n\nI hope things work out, OP.
