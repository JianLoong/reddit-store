We all moved in together 6 months ago. My fianc\u00e9 was never happy with the decision of living together with my best friend but he did not want to be a jerk since we found out that my best friend has cancer and he doesn\u2019t have a family or a partner, we were worried about him living alone a bit far from us. In the beginning, everything seemed fine, except when I started to notice weird behavior, my best friend does. He is always in his room when he happens to be at home, which is not often since he works far so he spent three nights of the week at his office. Whenever he is in his room, I hear weird noises and I smell bad scents. I confronted him but he lied. he\u2019s  generous and  pays most of the rent and the grocery shopping without us even asking. whenever we try to pay for something, he refuses. Maybe that\u2019s how he\u2019s trying to say thank you for hosting me. But we always had arguments because he doesn\u2019t clean up after himself. He doesn\u2019t even flush the toilet when he\u2019s done, he makes food and leaves everything on the counter. He would be eating a bowl of pasta then the bowl is broken for some reason, he doesn\u2019t clean it up. When I ask him about it, he says of course I will clean it. What do you think I will do, but he never does. I also found out that he is using my personal razor to shave his armpits that grossed me out. He said I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t think it would bother you. he has fundamental problems with the term \u201chygiene\u201d. But the weirdest part is when i recently got into his room when he\u2019s not home to close the balcony door because it was freezing cold and oh my God it is insane in there. very dirty,a strange liquid all over the floor. All his clothes are wet and smelly. I found big jars full of piss and poop. It is the most disgusting disturbing thing i have ever seen. I was so shocked I couldn\u2019t even face him with what I saw because I didn\u2019t want to embarrass him. Last night I heard him pour the jars of poop in the toilet, and left without flushing. He will only come home in two days, so he\u2019s expecting me to clean the mess after him. I feel like I am losing my mind. My fianc\u00e9 left the apartment to live with his mother for the last month because it\u2019s impossible for him to adapt with my friends behavior. He knows we cannot kick him out, and he cannot bear to live there specially that he has exams coming up and he wants a good and safe environment where he can study. I am worried about my relationship as well. going back to the story, I texted my friend to ask him, When is he coming home to clean up his mess because I\u2019m not cleaning up after him anymore and he got super defensive and aggressive. I did not like the tone it was disrespectful I asked him to move out out of anger, and he answered with that was already my plan because I\u2019m not comfortable living with you. He probably noticed my fianc\u00e9s disappearance.

While it is very sad your friend has cancer it has nothing to do with whether or not he is a terrible flatmate, which his extreme lack of hygiene, selfish behaviour and attitude shows he is. Therefore, him having cancer should not be a factor in deciding whether or not he should continue to live with you and your boyfriend.", "I have to wonder about how he was raised tbh,   like..  were his parents that neglectful that he thinks this is anywhere near normal behaviour?\n\nOr..  is he that mentally unwell?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should seriously see the expression on my face and how baffled i am to be reading something like this,  NTA", "Paragraphs!\n\nYou are well within your rights to kick the disgusting guy out. Cancer doesn't make someone like this. And just because the consequences of his abhorrent behavior are serious for him, doesn't make them your responsibility. I think you know that either he goes or you will lose your BF permanently. NTA", "NTA\n\njust because you have cancer doesn't mean you can treat someone else's home as your personal dump lol", "NTA\n\nI would say that this is extremely aberrant behaviour though, and it may be worth bringing up (if you feel comfortable doing so) to him that he should consider therapy if he is not already doing that. Using jars for excrement instead of a functional bathroom is something I\u2019ve only heard of once before in a young girl and it definitely seems like major professional help was needed in her case. \n\nI know a lot of men who are unhygienic but this goes beyond that\u2014I would be tempted to pathologise this behaviour. Is his cancer brain or waste related at all? That might be a contributing factor.", "NTA. You have to stick to your decision. Kick him out. I know it is hard because of his cancer but his behavior is not weird, it is dangerous for you own health. This level of dirtiness can bring insects, bacterias, fungus etc\u2026 also he sounds like he is entitled. You don\u2019t owe him anything, get him out of your appartement if not if your life.", "NTA\n\nSucks ge has cancer but he's being a total biohazard. Dude you're lucky the landlord doesn't evict you guys. 1 walkthrough and you're done!", "NTA hoarding behavior like this is not safe for anyone. Cancer sucks but that doesn't mean people with cancer automatically get a free pass. Your health and your flatmates health are at risk. The condition of the room they are staying in isn't healthy or safe especially for a person with cancer. Your friend/flatmate needs some professional help.", "NTA. That's very strange behaviour, and I don't think much of your fiance for running away and leaving you to deal with it alone either.", "NTA.  \n\n>...and he answered with that was already my plan ...\n\nAnd now you know why he's storing jars full of piss and shit.  He planned to make a big exit.", "INFO\u2026 is it brain cancer? Are his meds something that messed with his mental health? Because that is extreme and not even remotely healthy behavior. He is endangering your health now.", "NTA. I think your friend needs some type of mental health evaluation. Nobody in their right mind would act that way. Maybe he's severely depressed over his cancer. Either way... I think having him move asap and getting a professional cleaning company in there to do a 100% total overhaul would be in your best interest. Also, when things cool down a bit... Maybe see if he's open to seeing a therapist.", "NTA. He needs to change his lifestyle or move out. He needs to acknowledge that what he's doing is not acceptable -- society-wise and heath-wise. But because he's doing all these things, there's a bigger issue at hand. He needs an intervention for possible mental health deterioration. Maybe it's cancer or depression but something has to be done, if only due to being friends.", "The cancer has nothing to do with this.  This guy is unsafe to be around from a hygiene viewpoint.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If he's able to travel freely and do exams and the like he's certainly not so affected that he can't clean up after himself. He's not bedridden ffs. He's 5 years older than you and expects to be treated like a 3-year old.", "NTA. Cancer doesn't make someone shut in jars is their bedroom. Do you have any idea how Hrd it's going to be to get the snell out of that room? You know he sure as hell isn't going to worry about it.", "INFO. \n\nDepending. Has he always has an issue with hygiene or has this odd behaviour been since he was diagnosed? He could be having a mental break due to the stress of his diagnosis, side effects from meds effecting him mentally, cancer in his brain etc\u2026 If that\u2019s the case kicking him out is dangerous and as a friend I\u2019d reach out to professionals to make sure my friend gets help and is safe. \n\nIf he\u2019s always had an issue with hygiene and is just acting out but just so happens to have cancer, NTA. Not to sound rude but an illness isn\u2019t a free pass to abuse people around you, and in my opinion you\u2019re completely in your right to kick him out. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation OP.", "Info: what kind of cancer does he have and how bad?", "Sometimes kidney cancer in more advanced stages can cause mental confusion or delirium, or can spread to the brain which also can cause the same.  Unfortunately, I've seen this with 2 people who i knew had that cancer, one in his 20s and another in his 50s. Although neither did anything like what you're experiencing, they both did things that didn't make sense towards later stages, although it was more confusion than anything else... or, is it possibly he suffers from a mental illness too?\n\nDo you know why he won't tell you how far along it is? Is he getting treatment? \n\nNTA for wanting or asking him to move.  It sounds like he may need more care than is fair to expect of you, like a hospital.", "NTA.  Your friend is in a heart breaking medical situation but it sounds to me like he may need to be in assisted living or even nursing home care.  If his hygiene is anywhere near what you describe while he\u2019s at his job, he\u2019s not going to have that job much longer. Even the most generous and humane employer isn\u2019t going to let his behavior go on indefinitely.  Hopefully a case manager or social worker can help get him to an appropriate living situation.  He may actually be doing the best he can because of depression and brain fog from his illness & medication but he must have a different living situation with caregiver support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
