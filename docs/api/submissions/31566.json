This is a safety issue for all of your guests, you, and the dog.\n\nFrankly, there's a 0% chance they aren't reporting your dog for biting their (stupid) child. You should be looking up the laws about \"dangerous dogs\" and what happens after a reported bite incident.\n\nIn some places a dog which has bitten and broken skin is confiscated and held under medical observation for a period of time - regardless of their vaccination status.

And having it on a chain isnt sufficient.\n\nAs someone who was once a very stupid child, telling some kids to stay away from an animal is like waving a big red \"pet me\" flag in front of it.

His limits were clearly marked, since the grass etc was worn in a circle to the edge of the chain's reach.\n\nJerk Kid liked to antagonize George, but would stay just outside of his reach when he did. No matter how many times he was told to cut the shit, he kept doing it.\n\nWell...one day, he started in *again.* Only this time...he crossed the line, literally. As in, the line at the perimeter of George's reach. And he was teasing and antagonizing him, including I think throwing things at him. In fact, I think it was a thrown ball he was retrieving.\n\nSince he'd managed to get in reach though, after being a little shit for *weeks,* and he kept it up even at that moment...George, this sweet and lovable mush of a dog, *WENT* for him. Caught him in the arm, went right through his uniform shirt. He didn't, like, *savage* him or anything, but he definitely broke skin.\n\nThe kid's dad threatened to sue...but since George *was* chained, the limits of that chain *was* clearly marked, and he'd been *repeatedly* and clearly *warned...*nothing whatsoever came from it. Especially our biggest fear, that George would be put down for it.\n\nThe kid ended up changing to another Little League team...and every time he and my brother were up against each other, or even at the fields at the same time...he would be a complete little asshole.\n\nAnyway...given my own experiences?

They were also similarly used in bull-baiting \"sport\" in the 15th century and were bred specifically to be aggressive for over 350 years until bull-baiting was made illegal in 1835. \n\nBull dogs are prejudiced against for the same reasons as pit bulls, not due to mistaken/spilled over fear, but because bull dogs *legitimately* have *all the same issues* as pit bulls. They were bred for centuries to be aggressive and to have the muscle and jaw strength to wrestle and kill literal bulls. This makes them potentially difficult domestic pets, since they have as a result evolved to possess a predisposition towards aggression, the muscle and build to physically overpower creatures 2x their size and weight, *and* the jaw strength to crush a those creatures' skulls with very little effort. \n\nI love both pit bulls and bull dogs. But to state that they aren't *actually* dangerous dogs and it's all just unfair, illogical fear mongering is, as much as it pains me to admit, objectively both incorrect and ignorant.

Rottweilers and German Shepherds are the No. 2 and No. 3 spot, respectively... but frankly their numbers are nowhere *close* to that of pit bulls (666 attacks from Rotties and 229 from German Shepherds). American bull dogs are also fourth or fifth on the list. \n\nOf course that doesn't justify the persecution and straight-up calls for execution of these dogs.

Never harassed animals ever again and learned to read when they wanted me to leave them alone. It also made me respect them. \n\nDid my parents blame the relative who owned the cockerel? Of course NOT! It's the cockerel's home! It's also not the owner's fault, since the animal was contained. It was somewhat my fault since I was indeed warned and mostly on my parents because it's the parents' job to look after their kid! Kids are notoriously stupid and it's the parents' job to make sure the kid can't stupid themselves to permanent injury or death when there are known hazards around.\n\nIf a parent knows there's a road nearby, it's the parent's job to make sure the kid doesn't randomly bolt into the oncoming traffic. If a parent knows there's a cliff, it's the parent's job to make sure their kiddo doesn't run off the cliff. If there is a body of water around, it's the parent's job to make sure their toddler doesn't drown. If there is a danger around, it's the parent's job to not let their child near it. Accidents happen and they suck, but in this case it wasn't negligence on OP's part.\n\nOP told them there's a dog that doesn't like people and to stay away from it. At that immediate moment, the parents accepted that there is a hazard in the area and that they have a couple of choices: a) Keep the kid out of the hazard, b) Ask OP if the dog could be contained in a child proof manner or b) Deem the hazard too difficult to dodge with the kid and leave the party. This is on the parents. Lucky kid. But the same way I deserved to get my finger pecked when I knew what I was doing was wrong, so does OP's nephew. The reality is that you can't bubble wrap your children and you have to let them learn from their mistakes. This would have been a good lesson if the parents wouldn't have tried to shift blame off to someone else when they should have accepted that they dun goofed and explained to the child that a dog is a living being just like you and you have to respect animals.", "WTF?\n\nWhat has obedience to do with lying?\n\nI don't lie to my children. \n\nWhen I tell them \"I hate it, when you use my pens and don't put them away properly again and I want you to take care of my stuff\" I don't lie.\n\nOr when I tell them, I want them to put their dirty clothes in the laundry.", "We can agree to disagree I guess.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>they are responsible for their own actions. \n\nThe OP has a dog he knows bites and made no effort to lock the dog away when kids were around.

My cat is treated perfectly and is well taken care of but is a massive prick. He was upset with me because I already gave him 10 treats and wouldn't give him more because the package said not to give him more than 10. He kept whining and meowing and batted at me, I told him \"No\" and he hissed at me. I put the package away and walk out of the kitchen and he runs after me, wraps his paws around my leg and starts biting me as if I'd challenged him to a fight and insulted his mom while intentionally speaking his language poorly to spite him. I was sitting in my mom's room late at night because she's recovering from surgery and she feels better with me in her room so I can be there immediately if she needs anything. The door is kept open in case she needs to get to the bathroom quickly and so Furry McMurderPaws can get in and sleep on her queen size bed with her. He started whining and meowing which he just does for no reason sometimes, I gave him everything he could need and want before staying in my mom's room but he came up and whined at me, I gently shushed him and said \"Shh, quiet, baby.\" He started scratching the hope chest I was sitting on, I gently nudged him and said \"No no, behave.\" He hissed at me and kept trying to scratch and bite me till my older sister, who always keeps her door open for him as well and heard this, grabbed him by the nape of his neck(like a mother cat does to her kitten), and scolded him before he calmed down and left me alone for the night. My dog was abused by my aggressive dad but he only became more protective.

You know nothing about what I think about pit bulls.", "If OP's brother and kid deny what actually happened, there is no proof.", "Look, dude. I used to insist all the same things. I would've died on the hill that the prejudice against pit bulls is 100% BS and they're no more or less inherently dangerous than any other dog breed. \n\nThen I actually looked into the stats and studies. And I *kept* looking. \n\nI mean, even just for starters, you say that the stats previously provided are skewed because it encompasses three different subtypes of pit bulls, correct? Okay. So let's divide that number by three, just for kicks... you still get well over 2,000. Let's divide by 5... you get 1,400 per breed of pit bull (and that's a stretch, because one of those 5 breeds would have to include the American Bulldog, which one would be hard-pressed to mistake for a Pitbull). And just to remind you, the next highest breed was Rottwielers, whose numbers were in the 660s (i.e., not even *close* to breaking into the thousands).  \n\nAnd sure, yeah, people are \"notoriously bad at remembering details and guessing breeds\"... but no one who got mauled by a German Shepherd would confuse it for a Rottwieler or a Golden Retriever or even a pit bull. And more times than not, those self-reports are followed up/confirmed by animal control, the police, and even veterinarians and lawyers. Some people amongst that number of 7k are probably getting it wrong, sure; at least a few hundred. But no, it's not realistic to say that literal *thousands* of people are actually mislabeling pit bulls as the aggressor of an attack when actually it was a German Shepherd or a Labrador or a Husky. \n\nSo, yeah, if you want to insist that *all* statistics from *all* sources regarding this matter are intrinsically unreliable and inaccurate, then your argument holds water. But since the actual facts that *are* available directly contradict your claims... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">Bull dogs were not bred to be vicious, that's a myth.\n\nIt... literally is not. This is a very easily Google-able and verifiable fact so I'm not sure why you're trying to assert otherwise...? \n\n>Dogs which had a tendency to bite people weren't considered good choices for work and sport, like bull baiting.\n\nYes. That is because they weren't trained to bite *people*. They were initially trained to bite and wrestle livestock, then bulls and other dogs. \n\n>Pitties and Bullies are no more predisposed to viciousness than any other breed. Less so, in fact, than many others.\n\nMaybe just try doing some actual research, buddy. \n\nYou're also the only one repeatedly mentioning \"viciousness\". I did not use that word even once. Perhaps it's just semantics, but the word \"vicious\" carries significantly different and more negative connotations than the word \"aggressive\". \n\n\"Aggressive\" in this context means \"more likely to attack when feeling threatened than retreating or resorting to other responses\". Pit bulls, rottwielers, German Shepherds, and bull dogs (among others, including Chihuahuas and Huskies) all generally have a higher likelihood to respond aggressively to perceived threats than to back away or flee. Of course it still largely depends on the mannerisms and personalities of individual dogs... but there's a reason that Rottwielers and German Shepherds are often highly lauded guard/security/police dogs. They do not shy away from potential threats. This is also what made them good livestock managers and protectors: they wouldn't just jump ship and abandon the livestock they were meant to be managing if a coyote showed up.", "If a curious kid can access the dog easily than clearly the environment is not appropriate.

I agree that the parents should have taught their kid better and asked more about how secure the dog was, I *agree* the kid was in the wrong, which is why in another comment I've said ESH. OP doesn't shoulder the entire responsibility- but I firmly believe if you aren't prepared to go to the full effort of taking precautions, you shouldn't own a reactive dog. \n\nThe proof is in the pudding that an open kennel and chain is clearly not enough of a precaution to stop children getting bitten. \n\nA simple dog crate and padlock would have prevented this entire situation. \n\nWe can um and ah about who 'deserved it'.
