Seriously", "NTA considering the dog was chained simply means he went to the dog and provoked it, besides if he can afford a lawyer how about spending that money paying for his son's medical bill instead.", "ESH.\n\nYTA for not doing more to prevent an incident when you know you have a dog that does not like strangers and allowing strangers around it.\n\nYour nephew was wrong to approach the doghouse when he was told not to. But you said he was yelling at and teasing the dog. How do you know that if no one noticed him till after he was bitten.\n\nYour brother is an asshole. First for being a lawyer but that goes without saying. Second for insisting you pay for medical bills after his son who was old enough to know better approached an unfamiliar dog that he was told to stay away from.", "NTA\n\nYour dog was in his kennel and chained up, his son only has himself to blame.\n\nAs long as you can prove the kids were told to stay away from the dog and the dog was restrained, no judge is going to force you to pay the medical bill. \n\nIn any case your brother should have medical insurance for his family. If he hasn't thats his fault.", "So if the kid breaks a neighbors window will he tell them to fix it themselves for having poor quality glass? NTA for that part. Doesn't your brother have insurance? The cost shouldn't be that much. \n\nThe dog was secured we all know the fight or flight issue. Kids need to know not to approach dogs if they look agitated or not to come up behind them. I really hope you had chained up for company only.", "Nta. My grandpa had a dog that bit so I was warned to leave him alone. I didn\u2019t. Bugged him near his doghouse. Got bit. When I cried to grandpa I also got a spanking for disobeying over dog. This was over 50 years ago when I was around 6 so different times. But even as a little kid I knew it was my own fault for ignoring the warnings.", "YTA - When you knowingly have an aggressive dog, it becomes your responsibility to make sure that others are safe from it. Was Ian being stupid by not heading your warning, yes, but it's your job to watch the dog like a hawk as much as you seem to think it was David's job to watch his kids that way. \n\nIn the United States, most states' laws are going to be on David's side. Your giving the warning demonstrates you knew that the dog presented a danger, therefore, you were negligent in not taking steps to make sure that the dog could not come in any contact with the kid. If you want to make sure that the dog isn't euthanized (this could happen if a police report is filed and it is believed that it will happen again) and save the legal costs, I would suggest paying the medical bills.", "NTA. The kid fucked around and found out. I do think you will likely lose the lawsuit though. It is on your property and your dog. He could potentially get your dog put down too.", "If you have money - pay the bills and go \"no contact\" with them. Your brother is T A here, but if he sues you your dog could be in danger.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you warned them about the dog and had it chained up in a location where the kid had to actively seek it out to interact with it. Its not your fault that your brother is a terrible parent who raised a kid that thinks its a great idea to go antagonize a dog into biting him and who let him wander off to go do so in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, legally speaking, you may be in trouble. People are really prejudiced against bulldogs so it is going to be an uphill battle to convince the court that reasonable precautions were taken and that the dog only snapped at him because he was actively antagonizing the dog instead of it attacking him for no reason.", "Personally, as a Canadian, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TAH but I really don\u2019t know how much that would cost. 9 years old is old enough to know better and he was warned", "Sorry dude, YTA.  One verbal warning to a 9 year old with easy enough access to a grumpy dog on a chain is reckless.  Dog should have been kept in another room or otherwise secured away to protect him from your guests and your guests from him.  And how would you not offer to pay the medical bill?  You\u2019re lucky if he doesn\u2019t try to file against your homeowners insurance that likely has policies excluding \u2018bite breeds\u2019 which I\u2019m sure your bulldog would be on.

But the fact is that a child was injured by your dog. You should have taken stronger precautions to ensure that Ian had no way to get near the dog if he\u2019s prone to attacking strangers. Kids are stupid. They don\u2019t know any better. They will get themselves in trouble. \n\nYou should at least offer to cover a portion of the bill and apologize, despite Ian needing to learn consequences for his actions. Especially if you\u2019re going to be sued, that\u2019s a situation you really don\u2019t want to be in if you can avoid it.", "NTA.\n\nEven without a warning **teasing a chained dog is an asshole move**. I completely disagree with people who say nine is too young to understand this. Nine is plenty old, especially in combination with the warning you gave. But seriously, even without a warning a nine year old should know better.\n\nYour brother sounds like a serious asshole. He's threatening to sue you?!

Either that or Ian is incredibly honest and admitted to taunting the dog before getting bitten.", "It's just I had warned him. I am not happy he was injured, obviously, ubt it sounds really unfair to expect me to pay when I had told them before.", "Nah, this is how 9 year olds learn valuable lessons.", "> *\"Dog should have been kept in another room or otherwise secured away to protect him from your guests and your guests from him.\"*\n\nThe dog was outside in his doghouse and the kid purposely went and sought it out after specifically being told to leave it alone.", "Now I\u2019m not a dog person but it was chained up in its dog house so it was out of the way and the kid approached it, after being warned. No one\u2019s fault but the child\u2019s for goading the dog and the dad for not emphasising the importance of keeping clear which is what I would tell my kids if we happened to be in this situation.", "And I'll bet that kid learned a valuable lesson.\n\nA toddler needs to slam their fingers in a drawer in order to learn not to play with it. This is a similar thing imo", "I mean, I warned them and the dog was kept chained.

That\u2019s ridiculous", "The child, and his parents, learned an important lesson that day\u2026 keep your distance from dogs you aren\u2019t familiar with, especially when the dog is in its safe space (indoor cage or doghouse)\n\nIan had a FAFO rating of 7 that day, he\u2019s lucky it wasn\u2019t his face.\n\nEDIT: NTA : you warned him, he didn\u2019t listen.

I don't see what else OP could have done to secure the dog.", "Only the potential risk and harm is a lot higher. That kid could've killed him in the time it took the adults to respond.

You gave clear instructions and the dumbass felt entitled to ignore them. Kids are unpredictable and you should always play on the safest side when owning a dog that can bite. Making sure that there was no way to access the dog would have been the safest route. \n\nBut since the damage is done. You have partial blame due to owning a dog that can be hostile enough to injure a child. Best to own up to it and try to mitigate the lawsuit for your wallet\u2019s sake.", "Have you met kids before?\n\nOn another note, I grew up with an aggressive dog. My parents were in denial about his behaviour and he ended up biting several kids over time. If you know your dog is like this and you want to be able to have kids over, then you need to put the dog entirely away from people.", "The thing is, little kids will often test boundaries that are in placevyo keep them safe because they suspect those boundaries are there to limit their fun. I'm a teacher, and during Covid, I had kids removing their masks so their friends could blow into their mouths and noses. I had kids licking desks. Children aren't the best at separating real danger from adults being killjoy.\n\nReally, he should not have had access to the dog at all. That doesn't make it all your fault; his parents also should have really reinforced that this was a serious rule and been watching him more closely. But ESH."]}
