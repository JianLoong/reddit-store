It's your business if you want to show your face or not, and it seems his respect for your decision is really low.

Just a suggestion. This way, you can play with your BF on stream without showing yourself.", "Nta", "NTA-no one should force you on camera if you don\u2019t want to be.", "NTA, but it's time to grow up and be an adult.", "NTA\n\nThis is is not okay. Either have a talk with him or consider if you want to spend your future with someone who reacts like *that* about *clear set boundaries*.", "NTA , you\u2019re allowed to have your privacy respected. The fact that he got angry about it is really weird tbh.", "NTA. If this is a hill to argue on for him, he's an idiot not worth your time.\n\nDump him, do better.", "NTA. Fuck live streaming. He should respect your desire for privacy.", "INFO:  Was he a streaming gamer before you got involved with him?  That doesn't necessarily require you to be part of his activities, but just being involved with him will by default require you to surrender some of your privacy and autonomy.  You know this going in and shouldn't be surprised that eventually you'll be asked to be part of it.  The same would apply to dating any celebrity.  If you're not comfortable being in the limelight occasionally, then stay away.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's behavior is not cool.", "I think the video is on Youtube. One of the top gamers agreed to play under a female identity. He was stunned by the stream of insults and sexual harassment he got. He was used to be praised for his skills, he was insulted for being a bad player. \n\nShow that to your boyfriend and tell him that is what he wants you to go through. And if he is still having a tantrum think seriously about your relationship. It seems his channel is more important than you. \n\nNTA.", "He just wants to show his gamer buddies he has a GF.  All who probably live vicariously though him.", "NTA\nI'm not the type of person to comment saying you should break up with your boyfriend based off a Reddit post\nBut this guy's first reaction to being told \"no\" is to get mad and try to force you and then give you the silent treatment when you stick to your guns.\nI think this relationship is over", "NTA. I can't help feeling that his primary motivation to have your face on stream was to tap into the horny male gamers all over most streaming platforms and get his viewing figures up. I'm making a huge assumption here, and I may be way off the mark, but I've seen plenty of \"OMG it's a GIRL\" comments on Twitch and I've also seen girls get really high viewer counts even when they're just talking about absolutely nothing while standing in their kitchen or whatever. So I know the audience is out there.\n\nEither way, it's entirely your choice and he had no right to get mad about it.", "NTA. That's ridiculous. There are streamers who NEVER show their face at all and manage to be successful. A lot of streamers have their friends play with them and they stay semi-anonymous, no reason why he couldn't have given you the same courtesy.", "NTA dudes don't understand the difference. For him, showing his face is probably just something people do casually on stream, whereas for you it's opening yourself up to endless harassment, social media stalking, deepfake nudes circulating, doxxing... and once it's out there you can't take it back. wish I were exaggerating.\n\nI had a huge issue with a previous employer (I'm a carpenter so an entirely male workplace besides me) who wanted really badly to put me on social media. I was only an apprentice at the time so presumably it was for diversity points (only woman + visibly gay) or whatever. They didn't ask me about it any point, I'd just look up and there was a camera on me, including when I was doing something dangerous or bent over a workbench or whatever. I asked them to stop and got written up for insubordination. They were also talking about setting up continuously filming/livestreaming cameras in the shop so people could watch all the time. I tried to explain that being on the company's public social media was a danger to me; our address and work hours were public, so all someone would have to do would be show up outside the shop when we were closing and watch for me to come out and follow me home, but they kept going on about content and how even letting me know they were filming (so I could get out of the shot) would make it look unnatural and be \"bad content.\" It was one of the biggest reasons I left, and I've asked about social media policy in every interview since.\n\nBut tbh no matter your gender privacy is a human right. Weird that he cares so much about this.", "NTA, it'd be a very easy situation to resolve, just tell the chat \"my girlfriend's shy guys haha\" and that's the face issue tied up.", "NTA.\n\nWomen face a lot of harrassment online with guys tearing them apart if they don't look like an anime waifu.  Your bf could always do something cute/silly like have the camera pointed at a stuffed animal for Player 2 while the two of you game.  The fact that he's giving you the silent treatment for wanting privacy is concerning.", "NTA, your boyfriend is. Or soon to be ex-bf I hope.\nHe's trying to guilt trip you right now by giving you the cold shoulder.\nuno reverse him and break up with him for forcing you to do something you don't want to do.", "NTA.  Consent.  No means no.  You are more than content/clicks for him.  Stay strong.", "NTA. Him getting mad and forcing you is abuse. He literally thinks he's entitled to all of you, like he owns you and can decide what you do. He's not talking to you because he's punishing you and is probably waiting for you to come back to him and apologize", " NTA, I\u2019ve been streaming for a bit (very very very small following) but, I don\u2019t let my girlfriend on stream. They\u2019re some creeps out there.", "People who like YouTube vs people who value privacy.  An existential question.\n\nIs this a deal breaker for your relationship?", "Haha, wasn't expecting that video, but agree", "That is not the point. She said no. She doesn't need another reason than: I don't want to. He flipped his shit because she said \"no\" to a rather minor thing. It seems like he didn't actually asked but just expected her to comply. That is some disrespectful shit.", "Wtf?! He's a youtube gamer... he isn't even remotely in the realms of impacting his whole family with his hobby.\n\nHe wanted to show a woman, so his \"fans\" are happy. That's objectification."]}
