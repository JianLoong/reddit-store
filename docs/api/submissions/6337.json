If they give you crap for not taking on any additional oncall shifts, I'd just let them know you are ending your employement now and won't be around until the end of the week.  You don't owe them a thing.", "Sounds like Lucas is over employed and knows how to navigate. He likely is productive enough to not get fired.\n\nYour boss is an idiot for repremanding a good employee in favor of a flakey one.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso I'd call it out to either your boss or his boss. \"teamwork works only when everyone is inboard, otherwise I'm just picking up someone else's slack constantly.\"\n\nYpu can also take a hint and do as Lucas does. All hands on deck? Sick.\n\nUnfortunately imo this job is not worth salvaging. I'd do minimal effort ultil they fire you or just enjoy minimal effort. Just stay above the worth firing line. Don't do anything that is considered neglectful. Call FMLA if you need to, it's legally required (in the US)\n\nNow if you wanna get extra spiteful... Go out for drinks with the other team members and make collective agreements. Make sure the boss can't just offload responsibility on others. Collective action. Eventually it'll be \"Lucas can't but someone gotta take over\" \"well that's not our problem, sounds like a management problem and we all already have plans\" what's he gonna do? Fire productive members?", "NTA.  You've caught whatever bug Lukas has that's making him too sick to be on-call, and unfortunately aren't feeling well enough to attend the meeting.", "Hell no NTA. Sing, little birdie rat him out.", "NTA: You did your job. That your boss refuses to do theirs is a much worse mark on them than any \"teamwork\" remark they could possibly place on you.", "You\u2019re leaving next Friday and your boss wants to have a meeting to cover \u201cwhat your roles are\u201d? What a joke. Your role is \u201cleaving\u201d.\n\nThis is one of those cases where employers need to remember that giving two weeks\u2019 notice is a *courtesy*, not a requirement. You\u2019ve effectively quit, you have a new job, what do you care about doing them unfair \u201cfavors\u201d? \n\nNTA.", "Bring notes to the meeting detailing exactly how little work Lukas does.", "If it is the US, references are pretty much a thing of the past. You can direct a potential employer to HR for *employment verification*. Because of CYA, they will mostly only verify employment dates, job title, perhaps salary (if you provided that to the new company), and a Yes/No answer to an inquiry about whether you would be eligible for rehire. Anything else and they open themselves up to a lawsuit. \n\nSome companies can get around that by asking if anyone knows the candidate and what their impression is of them. However, this is less likely to happen since OP is moving to another state.", "Does this company always treat you so badly? I\u2019m petty but honestly I\u2019d just call in sick for the last week and say screw em", "If it's just a courtesy you could also at this point tell them that your starting date has been bumped up at your new job, and peace out now. Or give any other excuse. TBH it gives me a good idea what the management at this place was like, that they're trying to pull this kinda thing on you when you've already resigned.", ">Earlier this week, I finished my last on call shift since next Friday\u2019s my last day.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>I found a new job and gave them a curtsy three weeks notice that was resigning from my position.\n\nSo if I'm reading this right you have already worked 2 weeks of a 3 week notice.\n\nNTA,  but your manager is one -  as well as being delusional in thinking ***he*** is in the position of power.\n\nIf the boss is rude to you in the meeting, I would announce that since you are a \"team player\" you gave the company the courtesy of three weeks notice so as not to inconvenience your teammates in having to pick up the slack at the last minute. However, that doesn't mean taking verbal abuse from him, so you are giving him  your immediate notice. Then walk out and go pack up your desk. Let him explain *that* to the boss.", "I'm guessing the \"THIS\" is a reference to the recent \"nepotism baby\" post? Hahah", "Is your next job secure? Do you need anyone here as a reference? If you\u2019re in a position to do so, why not do the solid for the people remaining and those who come after you? Ask at the meeting how and why Lukas\u2019 job expectations are so different from the rest of you. Ask about salary, too!", "NTA - it always kinda grossed me out when I hear a person who gets a job from nepotism pulls this stuff. I know a few people who have gotten jobs from their family connections and everyone of them was told they would be kicked out on their ass in an instant if they pull any weird/dumb shiz.", "NTA - This is all very sus.  Is Lukas a nepotism hire?  If not, then I suspect he has dirt on someone higher up.  No one gets away with what he's getting away with unless they're related or have leverage.\n\nPlus you're leaving.  Wtf are they on about teamwork expectations?  You're not even going to be there, plus you've already done your time on-call.\n\nI'd tell them to hire someone who will actually do their job or they can cover the on-call duties themselves.  Then go enjoy your new job.  I get why you'd want to leave your current one.", "Plus you can forward the file to Lukas so he realizes that meeting was apparently calling him out for not carrying his weight around the office. NTA and you must be so glad to be leaving!", "Handout!! Please, do the handouts!!"]}
