But I cannot stand parents who have no boundaries or respect for privacy. You are SIXTEEN AND NAKED. It was fine to see you naked when they were responsible for bath time and diapers. You\u2019re a grown teen and your mother is looking at you completely nude and yelling. That is just.. beyond the pale. I remember my dad used to walk in so I made of point when I was in my room to basically be in next to nothing. Eventually he actually walked in on me changing which was so embarrassing but he never did enter my room without knocking. Ever. Again. I guess my question is why did she remove your blanket? She could have shook your shoulder or something. Also why get all mad at you? You overslept, teens and adults do that alike. It happens. Made no difference since it was just for a morning walk. Literally so NTA and your mom needs boundaries. \n\nMy advice: talk to your mom. Apologize for what you said but explain it was a knee-jerk reaction. You were naked and you\u2019re not a little boy anymore. Tell her you felt exposed and uncomfortable and if anything similar happens again, ask that she call for you or shake your shoulder. As you get older you do deserve boundaries and you just felt uncomfortable with her seeing you exposed as a near-adult.

She's seen you covered in shit and changed your diapers for years. She's fed you for 16 years. She's housed you your whole privileged life. You think she has some incest fantasy towards you? You think she owes you a knock on the door? Good idea: ask to be emancipated and then you can claim privacy and the right for a door knocking. Do you contribute anything towards your household besides expenses and time-consuming activities? Did she ever speak to you in such a manner when you were 6 years old and ran into your parents room without knocking? Does she not sacrifice all her pleasantries just so you can get the most basic and materialistic bullshit your infant mind could crave? I get it, I was 16 too. But truth is, you can choose to be a snowflake like some of these redditors or you can buck up and learn sometimes it's best to be the bigger person and show gratitude/patience/love/basic-fucking-respect even when you're not assed. Would you speak the same to your grandma if she did that? You think your dads a dick because he's taking her side? He's loved her longer than you've been alive. You're literally a younger version of him. The disappointment he would feel to think if he was to speak to your grandma like that. Shape up kid. There's enough punks in the world.

Your mother, who did go to the effort of waking up and getting ready, came in to get you. With all of the s2lf-centeredness of a typical teenager you didn't see any of her efforts because you were too preoccupied with resentment over anyone else asking anything else from you, and told her to f off. Now, faced with the inevitable results of deeply hurting and disrespecting people who love us, you are deflecting by making some BS excuse up about how you were just SO embarrassed by her exposing your poor naked body.\n\nAt the MOST, you sleep nude and she shook your shoulder, and you have now exaggerated that in your own mind and in every conversation in order to avoid taking responsibility for being a jerk.\n\nI mean, I COULD be wrong, but I doubt it.", "For the initial reaction, no.

What sort of degenerate In here is okay with telling their mother to \"F** off?\"; with how the parents reacted in this situation I'm pretty much sure the family is white and western because telling your mother to \"F** off\" in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa would've triggered Armageddon as soon as the father got home (OP would be either at a friend's or uncle's house now after an ass whooping that can only be described as biblical)", "Yea, yta.

Start by apologizing for being rude. Then, after things have calmed down, engage in a conversation about how what she did really embarrassed you and made you feel vulnerable and attacked in what is supposed to be a safe space.
