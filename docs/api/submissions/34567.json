You\u2019re a grown teen and your mother is looking at you completely nude and yelling. That is just.. beyond the pale. I remember my dad used to walk in so I made of point when I was in my room to basically be in next to nothing. Eventually he actually walked in on me changing which was so embarrassing but he never did enter my room without knocking. Ever. Again. I guess my question is why did she remove your blanket? She could have shook your shoulder or something. Also why get all mad at you? You overslept, teens and adults do that alike. It happens. Made no difference since it was just for a morning walk. Literally so NTA and your mom needs boundaries. \n\nMy advice: talk to your mom. Apologize for what you said but explain it was a knee-jerk reaction. You were naked and you\u2019re not a little boy anymore. Tell her you felt exposed and uncomfortable and if anything similar happens again, ask that she call for you or shake your shoulder.

She's seen you covered in shit and changed your diapers for years. She's fed you for 16 years. She's housed you your whole privileged life. You think she has some incest fantasy towards you? You think she owes you a knock on the door? Good idea: ask to be emancipated and then you can claim privacy and the right for a door knocking. Do you contribute anything towards your household besides expenses and time-consuming activities? Did she ever speak to you in such a manner when you were 6 years old and ran into your parents room without knocking? Does she not sacrifice all her pleasantries just so you can get the most basic and materialistic bullshit your infant mind could crave? I get it, I was 16 too. But truth is, you can choose to be a snowflake like some of these redditors or you can buck up and learn sometimes it's best to be the bigger person and show gratitude/patience/love/basic-fucking-respect even when you're not assed. Would you speak the same to your grandma if she did that? You think your dads a dick because he's taking her side? He's loved her longer than you've been alive. You're literally a younger version of him. The disappointment he would feel to think if he was to speak to your grandma like that. Shape up kid. There's enough punks in the world.

Your mother, who did go to the effort of waking up and getting ready, came in to get you. With all of the s2lf-centeredness of a typical teenager you didn't see any of her efforts because you were too preoccupied with resentment over anyone else asking anything else from you, and told her to f off. Now, faced with the inevitable results of deeply hurting and disrespecting people who love us, you are deflecting by making some BS excuse up about how you were just SO embarrassed by her exposing your poor naked body.\n\nAt the MOST, you sleep nude and she shook your shoulder, and you have now exaggerated that in your own mind and in every conversation in order to avoid taking responsibility for being a jerk.\n\nI mean, I COULD be wrong, but I doubt it.", "For the initial reaction, no.

What sort of degenerate In here is okay with telling their mother to \"F** off?\"; with how the parents reacted in this situation I'm pretty much sure the family is white and western because telling your mother to \"F** off\" in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa would've triggered Armageddon as soon as the father got home (OP would be either at a friend's or uncle's house now after an ass whooping that can only be described as biblical)", "Yea, yta.

Start by apologizing for being rude. Then, after things have calmed down, engage in a conversation about how what she did really embarrassed you and made you feel vulnerable and attacked in what is supposed to be a safe space.

You absolutely have a right to some degree of privacy but you do also have an obligation to wear bedclothes, it\u2019s a good idea should you need to leave your room during the night. Other than that, you have no real rights. You are a child in your parents home, you should obey the rules and at least try to survive long enough to reach some level of maturity. If you feel you\u2019ve been assaulted I suggest you report the matter to your local constabulary. They will thoroughly investigate any allegations. Your family will also very much enjoy the somewhat intrusive nature of an investigation that involves the police, social services, your GP and mental health support teams. I\u2019m almost certain your mother will guide you in sourcing the safe accommodation she will insist you need.", "You just wanted something to complain about so you twisted it around in order to do so.", "You talk to me about a younger generation, and I'm in my 40s. hahaha. And yet you talk to a 16 year old about having a micropeen and use phrases like drama queen and princess cake. How are you not embarrassed for yourself?\n\nAnd yes, it is a form of abuse to take away someone's bodily autonomy. This minor has said no multiple times and tried to have reasonable conversations with his mom, and she has ignored them and continued her behavior. If he reported this to a mandated reporter or to the police, they would be doing an investigation.", "Womp womp", "If you got age prejudice from what I said, there really is no hope for you. My comment was a nice way of saying that you seem to have no understanding of the real world and how it actually works. And yes, even though he is a minor, he has rights. It's not like you automatically get rights the instant you turn 18. He didn't \"disobey\" for what he wasn't wearing. You must have also completely missed the part where she walks in on him in the bathroom and when he's changing too.\n\nWhat the hell is the matter with you?", "My advice is to stop engaging with this guy. I made the mistake of having a back and forth, and it's utterly exhausting.", "And you just wanted something to be offended by.", "Don't get cranky about the fact I associate with enough young people on a regular basis to understand and be able to use their slang in the correct context.\n\nNo removal of bodily autonomy occurred here, for that to have occurred his mother would have had to ban him from sleeping naked or forced him to alter his body or bodily functions/habits and that never occurred.\n\nThe fact he's on the internet seeking validation for using abusive and vulgar language towards a parent shows the fragility of his ego. It's either time OP grew up and started acting like an adult if they want to be treated like one or continue to whine like a tween and get treated like one.", "Have you run out of real words to use?", "He said \u201cI\u2019m too damn old to be giving responses\u201d Did you miss that? Taking reasonable steps to protect one\u2019s privacy in a multiple occupancy home is just a case of common decency. I don\u2019t read anywhere about his mother entering a bathroom unannounced but having said that does he neither feel obligated to lock the bathroom door?\n\u201cwhat hell is the matter with you\u201d?", "Lol! I think I've got him on the ropes though! Hahahaha! Joking of course joking. For real though, that's his game. Trolling seems to be all he has to do and all he's good for. My prayers go out to him.", "I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re you\u2019re both friends. You can agree with each other, pat each other on the back and marvel at how clever you both are. It\u2019s a joy to watch such simple pleasure.", "womp womp", "I'm not cranky. Just pointing out your hyprocrisy about being part of an \"older generation\" when you're only 2 years older than me and using language that my 13 year old nephew wouldn't even use. I also find it a little odd that you find it a flex that you hang out with young people but to each their own...\n\nYes, removal of bodily autonomy has occurred. He told her he was naked, and she ripped the blanket off anyway. She has walked in on him undressing and when he's in the bathroom. \n\nI find it interesting that you use abusive when he used the f word once, but yet she continues to find ways to see him naked and won't accept when he tells her no and you don't see that as abuse.\n\nThis isn't about being a minor or an adult. There is no difference of \"no means no\" by age. It's quite horrifying that you think requiring consent to be seen naked is whining. I take it if you were at the gym showering and the same person opened up the shower curtain on 4 or 5 difference occasions, you'd be totally accepting of that? Because that's exactly what you're saying this kid should be ok with.", "He has comments about all of the ways his mom has invaded his privacy. There are also people who take the locks off the doors so it's very possible that he physically can't lock a door. And you're blaming a victim of abuse. If his mom was hitting him, would you also say it was his fault?", "Hahaha. And yeah, there are definitely some troubling opinions there, to say the least!", "I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re you\u2019re both friends. You can agree with each other, pat each other on the back and marvel at how clever you both are. It\u2019s a joy to watch such simple pleasure.", "Womp womp"]}
