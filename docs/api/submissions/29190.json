When we first moved in she asked if she could have the top fridge shelf and to keep it vegan, and to not use her cooking things without asking and to only use it to make things like vegetables to avoid cross contamination. This isn't an issue and I respect her choices. However as the weeks have went on it seems like she is subtly trying to convert the flat, for example by sending everyone various documentaries on WhatsApp and suggesting we watch them whenever we do movie night, at first it was fine but at this point it's honestly annoying and more than just me feels this way. Also, she is rather judgemental and will leave any room someone is eating meat in\n\nWell last night I confronted her and essentially told her I'm not going to become a vegan, that I don't care about the documentaries and that she's coming across as pushy.

I attempted to date someone very briefly, who was a vegan and initially because it was some thing I asked upfront about. Would he be OK with my eating meat in front of him and at first he said it was fine. Then the very first time I had meat in front of him which was a hotdog I ate my fries first, because I have a really small stomach and small appetite and I didn\u2019t want them to get cold and he thanked me for honouring his dietary choices, and I knew right then in there that it was more of a problem then he probably realized and we wouldn\u2019t be a good match. Lol. Out of many of the vegans I\u2019ve met only two of them were really chill and didn\u2019t try to push their dietary choices on others, while others were constantly plastering my Facebook page with articles and images of animals being tortured to the point where I didn\u2019t want to be associated with these people. \n\nI\u2019m still friends with him on Facebook but I find it interesting that he\u2019ll a post about how he feels so judged for his dietary choices and I\u2019m like dude you literally were judging me for my dietary choices when you said you were fine with it. Or he will ask other vegans how they deal with being around the scent of meat when it literally makes him want to vomit. He works in an industry where food is often provided, but there aren\u2019t a lot of vegan options provided and he gets really angry because he feels that why should food be provided for everyone else?

I watched the documentaries, but kept it to myself and simply made or brought my own food to eat. I've found that the community enables behaviour like this wildly and its never sat right with me. I think its good to be passionate about your beliefs, however forcing it upon others, especially when they've made it clear they have no interest, is unacceptable. In fact, just me stating that I was formerly vegan, a lot will argue that I was never vegan in the first place.

There are some people who will take politeness as a further foot in the door(which she was).

That's how communication works. \n\nI get the feeling that poor Sarah's probably not been a vegan for very long and doesn't really understand yet the ramifications of making a choice to do something differently to a lot of society. I've literally had meat eaters tell me I'm going to die of malnutrition because I'm vegetarian before (9 years so far and still kicking so...), and that's not an uncommon experience.\n\n Some people already take you saying you're vegan/vegetarian as a personal attack without you adding on any proselytising.
