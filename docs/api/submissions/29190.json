We all have our own rooms but share the kitchen and living area. I will call my vegan roommate Sarah for the purpose of this post.\n\nI'm totally fine with veganism and Sarah is nice enough. When we first moved in she asked if she could have the top fridge shelf and to keep it vegan, and to not use her cooking things without asking and to only use it to make things like vegetables to avoid cross contamination. This isn't an issue and I respect her choices. However as the weeks have went on it seems like she is subtly trying to convert the flat, for example by sending everyone various documentaries on WhatsApp and suggesting we watch them whenever we do movie night, at first it was fine but at this point it's honestly annoying and more than just me feels this way. Also, she is rather judgemental and will leave any room someone is eating meat in\n\nWell last night I confronted her and essentially told her I'm not going to become a vegan, that I don't care about the documentaries and that she's coming across as pushy.

I attempted to date someone very briefly, who was a vegan and initially because it was some thing I asked upfront about. Would he be OK with my eating meat in front of him and at first he said it was fine. Then the very first time I had meat in front of him which was a hotdog I ate my fries first, because I have a really small stomach and small appetite and I didn\u2019t want them to get cold and he thanked me for honouring his dietary choices, and I knew right then in there that it was more of a problem then he probably realized and we wouldn\u2019t be a good match. Lol. Out of many of the vegans I\u2019ve met only two of them were really chill and didn\u2019t try to push their dietary choices on others, while others were constantly plastering my Facebook page with articles and images of animals being tortured to the point where I didn\u2019t want to be associated with these people. \n\nI\u2019m still friends with him on Facebook but I find it interesting that he\u2019ll a post about how he feels so judged for his dietary choices and I\u2019m like dude you literally were judging me for my dietary choices when you said you were fine with it. Or he will ask other vegans how they deal with being around the scent of meat when it literally makes him want to vomit. He works in an industry where food is often provided, but there aren\u2019t a lot of vegan options provided and he gets really angry because he feels that why should food be provided for everyone else?

She\u2019s removing herself instead of forcing you to (which would be a jerk move).\n\nETA: comparison is kind of clumsy, but was trying to find a parallel for meat eaters about why it could be difficult for people to be around cooked meat.", "NTA.

I watched the documentaries, but kept it to myself and simply made or brought my own food to eat. I've found that the community enables behaviour like this wildly and its never sat right with me. I think its good to be passionate about your beliefs, however forcing it upon others, especially when they've made it clear they have no interest, is unacceptable. In fact, just me stating that I was formerly vegan, a lot will argue that I was never vegan in the first place. A majority of the community is toxic, just like any other, but there are some respectful people out there! I don't really think your roommate is being respectful of this though. I'm sorry this is happening to you and your other roommates.", "NTA. If anyone around you knows about your diet, you need to get a life. That's literally the last thing people what to hear about.

There are some people who will take politeness as a further foot in the door(which she was). A polite refusal will be read as, \"I'll test these waters later.\" By saying things so harshly it was the equivalent of slamming the door in someone trying to sell you something. So, she's mad because you're not longer on her list of the unconverted.", "NTA, and I didn't know the vegan teacher had roommates", "NTA.

She's allowed to suggest vegan documentaries and she's allowed to leave the room when people are eating meat if she wants to. You\u2019re also allowed to tell her you\u2019re not into that. That's how communication works. \n\nI get the feeling that poor Sarah's probably not been a vegan for very long and doesn't really understand yet the ramifications of making a choice to do something differently to a lot of society. I've literally had meat eaters tell me I'm going to die of malnutrition because I'm vegetarian before (9 years so far and still kicking so...), and that's not an uncommon experience.\n\n Some people already take you saying you're vegan/vegetarian as a personal attack without you adding on any proselytising. She's going to need to toughen up a bit if she gets so upset just from you telling her you're not interested.", "NTA.

Had a roommate who did this with Naruto.", "YTA. I understand you might not be interested in vegan documentaries, but why not give them a chance? You never know, you might actually find them informative or even end up liking some of them. Sarah is just trying to share something she's passionate about, and it's not a bad thing to be open to new perspectives. Instead of shutting her down, consider being more open-minded, and who knows, you might learn something new.", "ESH - you are an asshole, but not *the* asshole.\n\nVegans can be a little pushy with their ethos and get all bent out of shape about bloodmouths like us.\n\nThat said, you could have communicated any number of polite refusals besides telling her nobody cares.
