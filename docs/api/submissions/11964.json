Why don't you and your sister sit down and have a chat with her about moderation? Let Abigail know that food is meant to be enjoyed, so there's nothing wrong with cookies every once in a while.", "NTA What you told her was accurate - that the cookies are not health food and should be enjoyed sparingly. \n\nHer mother needs to have the conversation with her that it's fine to sell the cookies and up to her customers to choose how they fit the cookies into how they eat. Children have difficulty understanding nuance and that's why parents need to guide them.", "NTA\u2014even Cookie Monster says cookies are a Sometimes Food because they\u2019re not healthy to eat very often. \n\nThis isn\u2019t that serious.", "NTA.\n\nOMG, dietary restrictions are a thing, like, you are allowed to say No Thanks.\n\nI mean I understand why she interpreted that way, she must really respect you, but it's just kid confusion.  They don't think like adults and we have to teach them.\n\nSometimes people say no and that's OK.  It's our job to not take it personally and it's our job to teach our kids that people have different needs.  It's not your fault she reacted this way.\n\nBandaids don't fix bullet holes.", "soft YTA. your niece had something she was excited about and wanted support in, and you kinda dumped all over it. there was no way you could have known exactly how she was going to react, but she is still young and very impressionable on top of the fact that she's a young girl developing a (hopefully healthy) relationship with food. I remember being a kid hearing about how bad fat and cholesterol are and being terrified of eating anything with them in it bc they were \"bad.\"\n\nnot a single food is healthy or unhealthy. eating girl scout cookies *can be* healthy, but the message your niece got was that they shouldn't be eaten. so I don't think it's hard to see how someone who's been on the planet less than a decade might be concerned about actively making people fat and unhealthy by selling girl scout cookies.", "NTA\n\nBut keep in mind that niece is fund raising for her troop and future trips. Maybe buy a box and take it to work or give it as a gift to someone else. You don\u2019t have to but if you want to support her, consider it.\n\nMy troop was able to go to New Mexico for a trip based on the Girl Scout cookie selling we did. (We lived in Wisconsin).

You refused and she started being pushy.  Your sister should see that as a teachable moment.  It's ok to say no and you don't need a reason.  Even then, your reason was completely reasonable and you told her they are ok every now and then but not for you right now.  I think any doctor or nutritionist would have said the same.  Again, another teachable moment your sister is missing.  Instead of teaching your niece to be thoughtful about selling and eating healthy, she is teaching her to be entitled.", "NTA. By this age she should know that cookies are a sometimes food and you explained it perfectly. \n\nOne thing I do with all these girls outside stores selling their butts off is i will occasionally give them $5 and tell them to pick out their favorite kind and enjoy them while they sell, or donate the box to someone else.", "NTA\n\nShe asked and you gave her an honest answer. Girl scouts should really give kids something to sell other than cookies for people who would like to be supportive but don't want the cookies for whatever reason.\n\nAlso, to make things worse, most girl scout cookies contain hydrogenated and / or partially hydrogenated oils which are really not good for anyone.", "Just buy a damn box from your niece and give them away.", "Nta.  \n\nShe asked you a question. You answered. There's no need to lie to the kid.", "NTA, They are objectively terrible for you. All 5 boxes Ive ate this year have been terrible for me.", " NTA. You didn't mean any harm. \n\nYour sister could be managing the situation better by explaining too many sweets are not healthy but having small amounts is a pleasure in life and it's nice the Scouts are bringing that joy to people. \n\nNext time just make a donation without buying the cookies.", "NTA.

Something along the lines of, \"Cookies aren't something I'm interested in eating right now,\" would have been more appropriate. Things are changing and a lot of parents are learning that it's best not to restrict any category of food but work on allowing their kids to listen to and learn from their bodies to have a healthier relationship with all foods so that they never have to yoyo diet. Gone are the days of making your kids make a \"happy plate\" (aka trying to force them to keep eating) but also restricting access to sugar to only a few times a year (because restriction often results in overindulge later). Both set kids up for problems as adults. \n\nThat being said, I don't think you had bad intentions or realized this. So, live and learn. I anticipate the older set of readers who don't know this shift is happening will say you are N T A.", "NTA you didn't just say this out of the blue,  it was your reason to decline.

It\u2019s fine to not want to support your niece\u2019s cookie sales but you used it as an opportunity to share some biased food opinions. All types of food are fine in moderation and you can absolutely chose what to eat but sounds like you chose to blame cookies for your lack of purchase rather than personal choice - with young kids; it\u2019s important to distinguish as they take everything at face value.", "NTA.

It's a second grader, not a death salesman.", "I\u2019d say soft YTA. This is how body image issues slowly start in young girls.

I would have wished her well and sent her on her way.     Everybody knows cookies have sugar in them,    They usually have a couple of options that are low sugar/fat, but they are cookies.

Cookies are $6 in L.A.\n\nCan you afford to buy a box and give to a friend or let Abigail donate them?", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nThis isn't about the nutritional value of cookies. That's a spurious excuse and very selfish of you to reject her request based on your attempt to live a 'healthier lifestyle'. Edited to add: If you don't want to buy cookies and support her girl scout activities, then just say so; don't use nutrition/health as an excuse for not participating in the fund-raising.\n\nYou are very well aware that it's a fund-raising effort. Others have posted comments to educate redditors about where the cookie sales money goes. The cookie sale drive also happens to teach the girls a little bit about business, in case you weren't aware of that part. \n\nIf you don't want to eat any cookies, then don't eat them. No one said that buying cookies means that you are forced to eat them. You could support her girl scout participation by buying cookies then giving them away to the local food shelf. You could freeze them to have later as treats or to share at a party/cookout. You could bring them to your gym staff or to church social or to work.

It\u2019s also a gross oversimplification demonstrating a lack of knowledge in food science.\n\nNo version of food is either healthy or unhealthy. It\u2019s just food. Anything can be unhealthy in the right context. Does that mean you should eat cookies at every meal? Obviously not. But does that mean you should never eat cookies again? Also obviously not. \n\nHealthy eating isn\u2019t just what we eat, it\u2019s our relationship to food as a whole. Eating cookies in and of itself doesn\u2019t cause you to gain weight. Intaking more calories than your body can burn or naturally dispose of does. \n\nDiet culture has so thoroughly warped our societal views of foods that it\u2019s shown that it has actually promoted and enabled eating disorders at such high rates that what should be considered bad advice is still being touted by dietitians and doctors in some cases. \n\nI once had a dietician and a doctor on separate occasions try to tell me I needed to join weight watchers and to keep my calories at 1K a day. That had me on the yo-yo and it was awful. Weighing and obsessing over every calorie, severe food avoidance or substitutions, and other things done to stay in that zone not only made me miserable, it made me unhealthy. I gained back double what I lost. \n\nKeep in mind that WW doesn\u2019t make money if you lose weight and keep it off. They make money if you rapidly lose and gain weight, keeping you in the very unhealthy cycle, which makes you dependent on their products. \n\nBest advice ever given to me was to get away from all of that nonsense. Stop with substitutions, restrictions, and severe calorie cutting. I\u2019ve since treated my mental health, have my physical health taken care of well, and I work with highly knowledgeable dietitians and docs who specialize in obesity. I\u2019m down 70 pounds now and I had some cake last night. My labs look great now and my overall health has greatly improved. And I don\u2019t fee bad about that cake. It fit into my day in a very healthy and tasty way. \n\nCookies aren\u2019t good or bad. They are simple sweet treats.", "All I know is Ive cut out sweets in the last month and my face already looks thinner, my abs are showing better, and my energy levels are way up. Im not advocating for their eradication, they are delicious, but since utilizing my dietician/friend's plan, I've seen major improvements.", "Cookies *are* fattening and unhealthy in excess, something children this age usually begin to learn in health class anyway. The OP even said they were fine to have every now and then but they didn\u2019t want to eat them right now because they are trying to eat healthier. With the obesity epidemic sweeping the world, we should not be avoiding talking about healthy eating with our youth, and that does include discussions of unhealthy dieting methods that need to be avoided. There is no indication that OP is dieting in an unhealthy way as your mother did.", "If she is old enough to sell cookies she should be old enough to accept no as an answer and not keep pushing.

I tried freezing some one year, but they weren\u2019t good freezer burned. I avoid talking about fat and weight loss around them, it is so easy for girls to pick up negative ideas on that stuff. Instead I make healthy food choices and do active fun stuff with them.", "NTA but if your sister thinks that a 3rd grader is even going to remember in a couple of days that she was intending to boycott the sale of cookies, much less follow through on it, then I don't know what world she lives in.", "NTA", "YTA. Was it really worth ruining her fun? Just buy a box and give them to somebody.", "NTA....i feel like shes old enough to know sweets from healthy foods.... kids can be really dramatic too.", "Huge YTA\n\nThe cookies themselves are not healthy, I\u2019ll agree with you there. HOWEVER, you yourself even said that they\u2019re fine every now and then. Lots of things are unhealthy and even healthier things can be unhealthy in excess, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to teach moderation.\n\nI used to be in Girl Scouts. I tried selling cookies to family members who put themselves on strict diets that the refused to budge on. My other family would always get annoyed about how they always refused to buy any actual cookies solely on the basis on their diet. And while I understand that it was their choice to make, wouldn\u2019t it have been a nice gesture to maybe buy a box or two to surprise a friend who\u2019s not on a strict diet like theirs? And it\u2019s not like they imposed their diet on other those of us who were eating these cookies or went into the nitty gritty with a child about why these cookies, in their eyes, were sooooooo unhealthy, they just said it was their dietary preference and left it at that.\n\nI agree with your sister that that could\u2019ve be a good compromise, one or two boxes of cookies to give to someone else likely isn\u2019t going to break the bank. Or you could\u2019ve opted to donate a few boxes to active military troops instead assuming they still offer that as an option. And while some may say your niece got was she was asking for by pushing for info after you said no, she\u2019s still just a kid. She\u2019s not even 10 years old yet.
