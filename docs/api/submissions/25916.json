Maybe stay with a few different friends so you don't wear out your welcome.  \n\nIf you stay with a friend for a few days....your family will miss you.

THAT is enough for the whole family to realize....OMG, we have been depending on this person way too much.\n\nThere is always the chance this plan could back-fire.  Like, you go for a month and then parents decide you can NOT live there anymore.  But somehow, I don't think that will happen.  That's because under the circumstances, they need you just a little more than you need them.", "NTA.

You seem to be a very loving and caring sister, and you have already done way more than a sister is supposed to. A young woman of your age is supposed to study or work, and have a social life.

I would suggest you to move out permanently, if you can afford that, otherwise you will not have a life of your own.", "First off, no dad, thus isn\u2019t normal. Secondly, how long is this arrangement going to continue for? Are you never to marry, move out on your own, have your own kids.

Is that the life you want?", "NTA\n\nI think planning a full week away is a good idea.\n\nYou need to detach from the family dynamics to give your future some thought while you are not enmeshed.\n\nBe careful how you frame this.

Not helping raise them.", "No you're NTA and it actually sounds like it would be a good idea for you-- so you can get a break and re-evaluate your priorities. It's great that you have been so helpful to your family but it sounds like it's really skewed your perceptions. You SHOULD have an interest in friends, college, your future. That's totally normal and the fact that you aren't seeing that is troubling. Ultimately your brothers are your parent's responsibility and you need to remember that so you don't sacrifice your whole life for theirs.", "100% NTA, get out of there fast and go to therapy, what ur parents did to you is not right, they parentified you to the point you think its your responsability to care for your brothers.

That it's not not all and you need to care for yourself first. Plan and date with that friend so you can save and eventually get your own.

No way will  that situation ever change while she lives at home.", "OP really needs to understand that the parents DO expect her to take care of the brothers when they are gone.

That being said, I don't know how positively it would affect my brothers, especially the 19 year old. If it weren't for me, he'd still be showering once a week. He's been struggling with acne, and it was my bright idea to take him to the store to buy him face wash and moisturizer and teach him how to wash his face. I was the one who noticed that he can't hold things properly and brought it up to my parents so they can put him in ot or something. I have to make sure he gets to bed on time, and teach him how to eat so he doesn't make himself sick. I mediate between him and my mom bc he doesn't like it when she tells him what to do. I'm teaching him how to cook, do laundry, etc. My family can survive fine without me, but I don't know how my brothers are going to learn all these basic life skills when my dad's barely home and my mom wants her babies to have an easy time all day every day.", "Perhaps you should find a job halfway (or more) across the country.  My relationships with my mother (and my MIL!) both improved immensely once I was living several hours away so they couldn't just drop by on a whim.", "That's a really good idea that I've never even considered. I've always been expected to end up living in the same city as my family, as close to my brothers as possible(I'm talking same neighborhood/ house across the street), but I will be going to do an internship in another country early next year. They want me back as soon as the internship is over, even if I get offered a job there, but I honestly might just stay there because being offered a long term position is extremely likely in my case.", "NTA but take your dad's advice and move out or you'll never have your own life.

End that shit now.\n\nYour life should revolve around college, work and friends.

I mean, do they plan for you to never go away for college, or have a full-time job, or get married and move out and start a family of your own?\n\nThe parentification that's happening in your family is not okay.  \n\nI just went back and realized you're 22.  So you are an ADULT.  They have done this to you at the expense of your future.  If you can afford it, consider taking a week or two as a vacation.  Go somewhere and do whatever YOU want to do.  Even if it's just sleeping and eating ice cream.  It will be a hugely restorative break for you, and give you time to really think about what you want your life to look like.  It also will be an eye-opener for your parents.\n\nOne note, they are probably planning to have you fill the caretaker role for your brothers when they are too old to handle it.
