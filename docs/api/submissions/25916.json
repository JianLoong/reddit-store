It really isn't.", "NTA.  I think it's an almost perfect plan.  But I would tweak it a bit.  Announce you will be staying with your friend \"for a few days\" and then stay away from home for at least a month.  Maybe stay with a few different friends so you don't wear out your welcome.  \n\nIf you stay with a friend for a few days....your family will miss you.  But, they will parse it as...she needs a break.   Then when you get back, NOTHING changes.  You are no better or worse than when you left.  Family expects you to go straight back to your primary caregiver role.\n\nThat is why it has to drag out for a month or a little longer.  THAT is enough for the whole family to realize....OMG, we have been depending on this person way too much.\n\nThere is always the chance this plan could back-fire.  Like, you go for a month and then parents decide you can NOT live there anymore.  But somehow, I don't think that will happen.  That's because under the circumstances, they need you just a little more than you need them.", "NTA.  No, there's nothing normal about expecting you to give up your life to take care of your brothers.  I'd suggest something more long term than a few days away.  You have one life, you've given more than you ever should have already.", "This is not normal. Move out, but don\u2019t move back in. Your parents parentified you from a young age. You are an adult and you deserve to life life and focus on yourself. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been parentified and you deserve your own life.", "NTA. I don't think this idea is petty at all. I think it sounds like a good idea both for your family and for you. They'll stop taking you for granted (no, this is not normal; you aren't a parent, and you deserved a childhood too), and you'll get a tiny taste of what independent life might be like. \n\nI don't know about resenting your brothers (your dad has the wrong idea)- it's your parents who created this environment where you were always 2nd to them such that even you put them over yourself. They did you a serious disservice.", "Don't move out for a bit.\n\nMove out PERMANENTLY.\n\nI would say move to another state, city, town, but if you're going to college locally, that isn't feasible.  I will suggest that you move as far away as possible in your current locality, hopefully making it more convenient for you to attend college &/or go to work.\n\nIf you are indeed both taking classes and working, try to pick up more work shifts.  When your parents ask for your help, you can now tell them, with perfect accuracy, that between school, studying, and work, you are completely booked up.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nThey\u2019ve turned you into a 3rd parent and that\u2019s wrong.   You\u2019re 22 and you\u2019ve spent those 19 of those years living for other people and it\u2019s time to make a change. Move out, spend time at college or travelling and going out, making friends, living your life. You can\u2019t live it for others your whole life. Wanting to live YOUR life doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love your brothers. But living your life is what you deserve. \n\nDon\u2019t let them manipulate you and guilt you into coming home.", "NTA even remotely - stay at your friend's house for a week and go low contact while you're there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You seem to be a very loving and caring sister, and you have already done way more than a sister is supposed to. A young woman of your age is supposed to study or work, and have a social life. Moving out to your friends is a very good idea. I would suggest you to move out permanently, if you can afford that, otherwise you will not have a life of your own.", "First off, no dad, thus isn\u2019t normal. Secondly, how long is this arrangement going to continue for? Are you never to marry, move out on your own, have your own kids. I guess they expect you to live there until they die then take over as parent to your brothers. Is that the life you want?", "NTA\n\nI think planning a full week away is a good idea.\n\nYou need to detach from the family dynamics to give your future some thought while you are not enmeshed.\n\nBe careful how you frame this. You dont want to be seen as punishing your parents for not appreciating you, but as an adult considering your future options.  Let them know you will be away so they can make adequate arrangements (they will still feel the absence)", "\"I brought up my concerns to my father, who thought that my role was normal and what was expected of a young woman my age who lives at home, and since I'm harboring resentment to my brothers, he recommends that I get it under control or move out.\"\n\n\"I feel like I have raised and been responsible for my brothers as much as any other parent.\"\n\nNo. This is NOT normal. This is your parents taking advantage of you.\n\nYou are NOT a parent. You have a right to live your own life. Have you been able to get an education so that you can live on your own? \n\nWhat are their future plans for THEIR other children? Are you expected be their caretaker for life?", "Or as an adult she could act like one and communicate that she needs time away to consider her future.  \n\nPlaying games is for children.\n\nYou are right about her needing more then a few days away though."]}
