So because of this, both of my husbands kids don\u2019t respect me to say the least. \n\nFather\u2019s Day, all celebrations really, I do go a little over board. Always have, and always will. I don\u2019t have the expectation that anyone does the same for me. I do this because although he is not MY dad he is the father of my kids, without him, I\u2019d never have my youngest kids. I do appreciate what he does. His view on holidays and birthdays are weird.

Just how I was raised with it in my immediate family (some relatives celebrate different). My culture is pretty mixed on the debate, it\u2019s more family-to-family dependent.\n\nTo be fair my Dad did help us out when we were kids to celebrate mothers day, just as our Mom did with father\u2019s day. There is a kind of sense of \u201cmother/father of my child\u201d appreciation included (like they would do nice things for each other on the day -letting the one sleep while they attend to the goblins [my brother and I], breakfast in bed [not always but I remember a few attempts the goblins \u201cassisted\u201d], assisting gift ritual from the goblins, a smooch with each other \u2014 I\u2019m dredging out the old childhood memories, some things we aged out of). I\u2019m uncertain if they wished each other \u201chappy x day\u201d even as a smooch precursor - my parents mostly direct their obligations to their own respective parents by calling or visiting (whsn alive).

Yeah, I would be a mother, but not his mother or mother of his kids, so it feels off. \n\n The stepparent dynamic throws me off - I don\u2019t have any nor am I one and I\u2019m a bit iffy on where things are exactly in your situation - but I would default to \u201cnot my mother\u201d.", ">\tkept telling me \u201cyou\u2019re not my mom, MY Mother\u2019s Day isn\u2019t about you\u201d and \u201cyour kids\u2019\n\nWhoa!

On your anniversary, do you honor all married people (some people do this). When someone you know graduates, do you celebrate everyone you know who has earned a degree? I think it's positive and by all means acceptable to honor all moms - I don't think it's an expectation.\n\nSounds like he could have been a better partner but that's a separate issue.

In my country mother's day is absolutely about people celebrating their own mothers, and this concept of everyone celebrating all mothers is very weird for us.

I should add that the custom is specifically to visit your mother with flowers, not some of the over-the-top celebrations I see in other countries.

What is going on with her children that her husband felt he had to tell her to stop ruining mother's day for them? Did her children celebrate her but she wanted her husband to do it too? Is she just sad because of her mother's death? What did she want?", "I kinda sorta agree.  All moms should be celebrated.  There is no implied obligation though if your partner is not the bio mom of your own kids.  You're not \"wrong\" in that situation no matter how you play it.  Acknowledge the day, or don't.

Also, this is very much a case of created demand and expectations; in my country people aren't devastated when everyone doesn't drop everything to celebrate them on mother's day (or birthdays or weddings etc) because there is no cultural expectation. Would the OP be so depressed about her husband's failure to..., actually I am not sure what she wanted, if she hadn't seen a gazillion sm posts about over-the-top celebrations by stepparents for their spouce?", "Pretty common one. It\u2019s almost like different families/communities/countries have different ways of doing things/norms. I think it\u2019s weird that Australia doesn\u2019t celebrate Halloween, but I don\u2019t call them horrible for it. \n\nI\u2019ll check with my parents, but so far no one has reported sobbing to themselves from lack of appreciation/unmet expectations on mother\u2019s/father\u2019s day when I\u2019ve asked before about it. We\u2019re a pretty close family. \n\nFrankly Mother\u2019s Day has only been an official thing in my country since 1915, only 11 years before my Grandpa was born (first born grandparent), so there is a lot of fluctuation/variation in sentiment to it because it isn\u2019t long established (not like birthdays or Christmas).\n\nI know families that don\u2019t celebrate it at all, I have heard of ones that excessively celebrate it. Our Village has a recreation commission that celebrates it for all mothers (they also expanded it to all women, mothers or not, for a few years which was weird and got them complaints), but not all mothers in the Village attend their activities (maybe 1/3 to half of the mothers at best).", "So, is she and the kids celebrating him on father\u2019s day? I believe you can\u2019t expect someone to celebrate you if you don\u2019t celebrate them and this gets very tricky with stepparents. \n\nI know quite a few families - in person and identified on AITA - where the stepparent is not celebrated on mothers/fathers day because \u201cthey aren\u2019t the parent\u201d, the kids are not comfortable with it, and its considered overstepping if the other parent is living/involved (sometimes the stepparent is literally told that they cannot parent, cannot be another \u201cDad/Mom\u201d and have to leave it to their partner and their partners ex; yes, they\u2019re part of the family but not part of that responsibility/authority in the same way). \n\n But it really depends on the dynamic - raised kid since infancy?  Part of the family since the kids were 5 and 8? They were 18 and 24? Everything is maybe, maybe not and it is very hard to generalize. \n\nThere is a lot of missing info that would help sort it out that isn\u2019t present. She doesn\u2019t identify ages of the kids (they have been together 6 years but only married for one month - how long exactly has he been involved with the kids?). She doesn\u2019t identify how the kids view him (parental vs not parental). She doesn\u2019t clarify how they have been celebrating the day for the last 6 years - why should it change just because they have been married for a month? She doesn\u2019t identify if the kids father is involved and if he did anything or not. \n\nMarrying into a family usually means a blending of traditions, creating new ones and compromises. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean that Mom\u2019s view on mothers day and his role in it become \u201cthe way\u201d. They really should have talked and sorted it to be on the same page before marriage. \n\nI\u2019m really iffy on where things are exactly in their stepparent dynamic because of the missing info.", "So what exactly did you want him to do? It sounds like you had a nice family day with your kids. That sounds like a great Fathers\u2019 day to me!", "Good point!", "Im actually not sure why ppl see the need to celebrate mother Day anyway. While i  see the sense of being thankfull to eachother in general, and celebrating birthday to give each person their special day, why thanking a mum to be a mum? In best case scenario, both parents decided to become parents, and so they are responsible for their kids. Loving and caring for their child is what is expected of them, other way they should not be parents to begin with. Btw here fathers day is something that was made up by some men who where jealous of mothers who get their special day. So men uses the \"fathers day\" to meed up and get out of control while drinking, even when they are not even a father. And while i know some who would buy flowers for their mum, but noone would throw a big Party and make the whole day about the mother if its not their birthday. So cultures the things different, families see things different. Wanting to feel special on mothers Day is strange to me, but okay, as long as everyone else in family gets along with it. But demanding it and Making the husband the ahole for making mothers Day about his mum is just the real ahole move. Some values arent cemented rules everyone on this planet follows. Some values differ and have to ne discussed beforehand."]}
