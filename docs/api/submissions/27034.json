To put it simply it doesn\u2019t matter what your preferences are to other people only you get to decide what you do with your own", "And the same goes for men, right?", "Good thing women don't owe u a thing and do what they do for themselves.", "Well it's a real good thing that women who don't shave aren't trying to appeal to you, isn't it then?", "WOMEN DONT EXIST FOR YOU TO LOOK AT- WE ARE NOT ORNAMENTS!", "Problem is you're saying other people should bow to your views, which makes you the asshole. If you had your opinions but didn't try to impose them on others it wouldn't be an issue", "I usually use my husbands trimmer \ud83d\ude02 he definitely can tell afterwards even though I wash it\u2026. He seems pleased about though but maybe I should get my own lol", "While I get the whole woke thing, it\u2019s good that atleast the women I\u2019ve come across in public have shaven legs.", "Oh ok, cool", "Yep", "Seems like a lot of previous trauma, hopefully you\u2019re working through it and come out the other side feeling better", "I don\u2019t impose them on randos, but just that I wouldn\u2019t be with a woman who prefers to sport hairy legs, \u2018stache, and pits.", "No, you don\u2019t get it.", "Sounds like your encounters with women are few and far between.", "Seems like you have a lot of ignorance you need to work through- I hope you take the time to become a better person", "There\u2019s a different between having a preference and believing that those who don\u2019t fit your personal preference shouldn\u2019t be seen in public."]}
