I find his stance highly hypocritical.  Personally, it would be a turn off for me as well for my gf to have excessive body hair.

Honestly, if he finds you that unattractive, time to find someone who finds you attractive.", "He's got a double standard and while he's right, you don't get to tell him what to do with his body hair, he thinks he has a right to tell you. Add to that that,  he's willing to call you names over hair but gets butt hurt when you do the same. I have to wonder how else he behaves this way in your marriage. You're not the asshole, but it sounds like you're at an impasse. You can shave and accept his assholery, you can not shave and continue the war and also not have an intimate relationship (he won't shave), or you can choose door number three, which can be counseling all the way up to divorce.
