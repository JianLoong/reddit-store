{"id": 23358, "submission_id": "15c6m8w", "title": "AITA for taunting my dad's wife with the fact she will never have grandchildren or a son?", "selftext": "Sandra has been married to my dad since I (26m) was 7. My mom died only 18 months before they got married and Sandra offered to adopt me once, but I said no. I had only known her for about 9 months. From the beginning I got the vibe she hated the fact dad had been married before. I found out later what she hated was he had a son already. She's very old school and believes men deserve to have sons so they can have their family name carried on. She also has this outdated idea that a son is needed to carry on any family business. She had three girls with my dad and her jealousy of my mom intensified. Over the years I lived with her and my dad she made some of the shittiest comments about my mom when dad's back was turned. He was so shut off from me after mom died that I didn't tell him about them at first and when I did finally, it was too late, he knew I hated Sandra and accused me of trying to break them up.\n\nI have almost nothing to do with them now. Sandra isn't too sorry about it. Before I moved out she told me we could have been good if I had just let her claim me as her own and let her have the joy of giving her husband a son, but I stayed faithful to some immoral whore who died when I was hardly out of infanthood. She said I was clearly as immoral as my mother. I told her she was an evil cunt for being so jealous of a dead woman. I also told her that she wasn't worth the tip of my mom's pinky and she'd have to live with the fact she was never dad's first choice. I also threw in her face the fact that he would visit my mom's grave in secret, the fact dad slipped and called her mom's name once or twice, and I also told her to enjoy her weird shame, because she was deeply ashamed that she never gave him a son. She felt everyone was mocking her or something.\n\nMy dad tried to reconcile with me but it was too late for me. The first time was 3 or 4 years ago and then last year when he and Sandra's oldest died. I never kept in touch with anyone so I only realized what had happened when dad explained why he was trying to reconcile. Then a couple of months ago he found out I was going to be a father and asked if he could be a granddad if not a dad. I told him no. Then Sandra shows up and I don't know what she was expecting or how she tracked me down. But she showed up at my door and wanted to know how I could deny my dad a grandson, how I could deny them a grandson. She told me it was the least I could do for shaming her. Instead of shutting the door in her face I threw in her face that she'd never have grandchildren or that song she longed for. She does have two living daughters. But both are severely special needs and will never be able to live independent lives. I knew it was a low blow. She stormed off close to tears.\n\nMy wife's parents were here at the time and despite knowing the history they think I was too hard on her. Dad accused me of being a cruel asshole to his wife. He said to take my anger out on him not her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690572207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c6m8w/aita_for_taunting_my_dads_wife_with_the_fact_she/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That woman spent your entire childhood attacking you and the memory of your mother, and your father took her side. He does not get to speak about cruelty when he allowed a woman to torment his child for years. \n\nThe fact that he even had the audacity to ask to be a grandfather when he was never a father to begin with  is astonishing. Even more astonishing is the fact that his wife believes she has the right to anything of yours much less your children.", "NTA. \n\n\nCongratulations on your beautiful baby. \n\nIt was a low blow, but she deserved it.

I hate having my \nstepsh!t's last name; it boils my blood. \n\n As far as your dad, though, take a deep breath, and when you find it in your heart, find time to reconcile for you, him, and the grand baby. You can wait until the baby is 17 if you have to, just if he wasn't abusive, took care of you, and showed you love, just be kind and show love back. My mom wasn't abusive to me, loves her grandchildren, and spoils them rotten. I'm happy I let her in their lives and don't regret it at all. I hope he will show the same love to your baby.  Congratulations!\n\n But my stepsh!t....I'm so happy I got the chance to tell him my true feelings the father's day before he died, and I'm glad you got that chance to say the same to your stepsh!t mother, too.", "NTA.\n\nShe deserved worse.\n\nAnd father should have respected your mother more.\n\nAnd to those who attack OP:\n\nHypocrites, all of you, acting all \"high and mighty\" while knowing you'd be worse.", "NTA especially considering the fact she tracked you down after years of cutting her off, Don\u2019t feel bad for trying to combat crazy.

You do not want these two around your child. Keep away and have a happy life! Otherwise they will drive you nuts.  Who knows what they will tell your child as it grows up.

It was unfair that your dad didn't believe you and sided with his new wife over you, his daughter, and I'm sorry for how incredibly painful that must have been. I hope you can find a good therapist to help you cope with the feelings of abandonment. It's not right or fair, but it's the lot you've drawn, and you deserve a chance to recover from it.", "NTA - she sounds horrible and deserved it. \n\nAlthough it sounds like with the passing of your sister, your dad has realized his mistake. \n\nIf you feel like you can, I would have a conversation with your dad and maybe air all your feeling and see if there is a chance for you two to reconcile.
