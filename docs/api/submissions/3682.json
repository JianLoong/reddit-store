Holiday time is when they all gather together and have a huge celebration. Unfortunately, mom and dad got into medical debt and lost money on multiple surgeries in the past months. As a result they said they could not afford to have a decent christmas celebration which is devastating since all of our relatives wanted to come to celebrate both christmas and their health improvements.\n\n\nDad came up with the suggestion to borrow money (3 thousand dollars) from my husband (m32). My husband's family are well off but my husband is dependent on himself and rarely asks them for help. He has a savings account to start investing in the land his father left him. He's been saving for 3 years now. I brought up my dad's suggestion to my husband and he refused saying he didn't have that kind of money but I pointed out how he has a savings account with over 7 thousand dollars but he said sorry, but he needed it to fix and invest the land to be able to change his job and work less hours because the land wikl be a source of an income once invested in. He said my family don't have to to have a fancy celebration and instead having one that fit their budget. I explained that we're a huge family with many kids and the money will go towards them. He told me he wasn't willing to waste his money on a ridiculous \"cause\". I got upset and told him that he'll get his money back but he pointed out basically how my parents are still struggling with medical debts and questioned their ability to return the 3 thousand dollars. We argued and I ended up calling him selfish and cruel for refusing to helo while having the means to. He said he didn't nobody nothing then walked out the room.\n\n\nI stopped talking to him now he thinks I'm being the cruel one for not seeing how important his dad's land is for him to get fixed and invested in.\n\n\n\nInfo - my dad didn't ask family to chip in with money because he felt it might be rude and inappropriate to ask family to pay and it'll make it look like he's basically charging them to attend.\n\nInfo - I can't help because I'm a student and have no income.", "created_utc": 1669916999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9ubjl/aita_for_calling_my_husband_selfish_for_not/", "score": 1003, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is absolutely right - this is very unlikely to be a loan;  at least not in any type of short term situation.  If your parents are that far in debt, it's highly unlikely they'll ever be able to pay it back.\n\n2.  3k for Christmas is an absolute luxury.  Period.  No other way around it.

This isn't an essential by any means.\n\nYour family is huge.  Why haven't they started up a collection to give to your parents?

Being poor sucks. We do what we can and live within our means. Borrowing 3k would be better put to use to pay off debts rather than incur new ones.\n\nApologize to your husband as he\u2019s neither greedy nor selfish (for this any way.)

That's just a ridiculous sum of money, for a ridiculous reason.", "YTA\n\nMassively! Your big huge ginormous family can each pony up 50 bucks and give it to your parents for the party.

This is incredibly short sighted of you.", "YTA.  Your husband is sensible.  Money \"lent\" to relatives often turn into involuntary gifts (AITA is full of these stories).

If you want to give that much money, you use your own money. Not half of your husbands savings", "YTA, never \"lend\" money to family (unless you are willing to let it become a gift). I'm 100% with husband on this. Just do what you can afford. Ridiculous to borrow $3000 for Xmas.", "YTA and an idiot. You have a large family? Let them chip in. You have no income and you're asking your husband to give up ~half his savings in a loan he *correctly* assumes he may never see repaid.\n\nYour parents *should* celebrate within their means, and if your family wants something more extravagant, they can contribute. Who the hell is spending 3k to celebrate Christmas anyways? C'mon now.", "Wow of course that YTA. He has to support you and pay for your family's celebration? WTF and how is it rude to ask family to chip in but it isn't to ask your husband to give up almost half of his savings for a party? Are you out of your mind? WTF is wrong with you? So entitled.", "YTA there is 0 need for 3 grand for Christmas I don\u2019t care how big your family is, I\u2019m from a huge family and guess what my family hasn\u2019t come close to 3 grand for Christmas like that\u2019s a waste of money, your parents need to live within their means. You are being the selfish one he is trying to save money to make your lives better and you act like he\u2019s a bank for your family to use. Hopefully you apologize to your husband and see the error of your ways and if you don\u2019t I hope your husband smartens up and leaves and find someone who doesn\u2019t use him for money and try to manipulate and guilt him into spending HIS savings on their \u201cbig family\u201d if your family is that desperate for money find a job and give them some money yourself.", "YTA because this sounds like they're borrowing money to keep up appearances and \"save face\" instead of actually needing the money. I'd want to know what the money is going into. Are they paying for people's travel? Room and board? Is it food? Is it for presents? People can still have a great Xmas spending time with one another w/o all of the bells and whistles.", "$3000 for Christmas? That\u2019s wild. \n\nI will say he\u2019s an asshole for calling something important to your family to be a \u201cridiculous cause.\u201d \n\nBut yeah. YTA.", "YTA your family does not need a 3k Christmas celebration when it's not in their budget. Ask everyone to bring a dish and something to drink and they can spend minimally. Your husband should not be financing it for them when they can't afford to repay it and it's just completely unnecessary.", "YTA you want your husband to turn over half of his savings for a Christmas party? Are you ok? It\u2019s no wonder your parents are saddled in debt and you seem well on your way. That is completely financially irresponsible and reckless behavior. You can have a potluck and gather the family to celebrate. Unless it\u2019s really not about gathering but flashing wealth. Y\u2019all don\u2019t have money to flash to celebrate in your lane.", "Let me see if I am understanding this correctly: You are asking him to give up nearly half his savings, which he has worked on for over three years, and is trying to use to invest a better income/financial security for your family\u2019s future\u2026.\n\n\u2026.. so your parents can throw a big Christmas party.\n\nI think you really need to reevaluate your priorities here. You shouldn\u2019t even lend family members money to start with. YTA.", "YTA your dad asked and your husband said no. This isn't helping someone in need but a 'fun' event. You could easily figure out a different solution that doesn't require your husband paying for everyone's dinner.", "YTA.  If you want this for your parents so badly, go out and find a job to contribute (I worked full time the entire time I was a full-time student).  You have no right to expect or offer up something that belongs to someone else, and if your father is the one who suggested this, I can see where you get your gall.", "My rules apply as always:\n1. Never mix money and friends\n2. Never mix business and friends\n3. Never make friends with business associates\n\nWhy? Because you're eventually going to lose one of them!\nSo, YTA", "YTA", "Why are your extended family not offering to help with costs of a big celebration if they want to celebrate your family's health, expecting them to pay for it knowing what they've been through seems sucky. Or are they used to freeloading off your parents?", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t have a money crisis and even I wouldn\u2019t splurge 3000$ on a party. What are you serving? Caviar? \n\nIf you\u2019re in debt and have no means to repay, how would they afford the extra 3 grand to return to your husband who actually has a pretty rational explanation for what the money is for? \n\nYou\u2019re so massively TA that you can\u2019t even see it. Your poor husband deserves an apology.", "YTA. That's a lot of money for a single party. And you're asking your husband to allow your family to \"borrow\" almost half his life savings (but let's be real, it most likely won't be returned to him, so he'll just be out of the money).\n\nIf your family still wants to have a party, why don't you all forgo presents this year (or implement a spending budget) and have a potluck dinner where everyone contributes a dish? \n\nAfter all, the holidays are supposed to be about spending time together as a family, not about expensive dinners and expensive gifts.", "YTA, if you weren't cruel you'd recommend $3000 to pay for the medical bills, this is clearly for presents. You're cruel to stop talking to him since you have no income and use an excuse like \"student\" when plenty of \"students\" get jobs. You have no income, so he's supporting you? You're manipulating your husband and that is the last thing you ever do to someone you love. Thats cruel.", "YTA \n\nI hope your parent's health continues to improve, but it's unreasonable for them to want to host a fancy celebration when they can't afford it. \n\nEveryone in the family should be pitching in, and if they are not willing to contribute, they are leeches. \n\nYour husband is right, if they are struggling financially, how will they repay him?", "YTA. If you can't afford it, scale back. Nobody owes you anything, and you know full well he'll never get that money back. You can have just as good a celebration without going into debt.", "YTA. I was in a traumatic accident this spring and was out of work for over four months recovering from my injuries. I can\u2019t afford Christmas this year at all. My kids are disappointed but they understand. Yeah, it helps they\u2019re 13, 16, and 19, but we have to make sacrifices because there just isn\u2019t the money. Sure, I could borrow it but I\u2019d rather, if I was borrowing, borrow to pay the rent I haven\u2019t paid since April or keeping the electricity on. What matters is that my youngest and I didn\u2019t die in that wreck and we\u2019ll all be together for Christmas. Your husband isn\u2019t an asshole because he wants to prioritize the future over one holiday. Explain to the kids what\u2019s going on, be thankful your parents are around, and be happy you\u2019re together", "YTA.  No single Christmas celebration should ever cost THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS, no matter how wealthy its participants.  For a couple who is struggling financially, it's absolutely ridiculous to even think about having that kind of elaborate party.  Borrowing money from your son-in-law to finance an over-the-top shindig that would be frivolous (and quite frankly, stupid) even if you DID have the money is just... so confusing to me.  \n\n\nI think it's also hilarious that your dad would rather ask his son-in-law for a large sum of money than ask the people who are coming to the party to each contribute a small sum of money toward food and drinks that they will be consuming.  It is totally normal to have a potluck type event where everyone brings something - and your parents are not able to afford anything more than that, so they should get used to the idea.      \n\n\nYou and your family seem to have weird ideas about money.  Were your parents looking at your husband as a meal ticket when you married him?", "YTA of course. Why are your parents prioritizing having a big holiday celebration when they are financially struggling? And it's weird your dad thinks it's inappropriate to ask family to chip in. Your husband is completely in the right here. You owe him an apology.", "That's one way of putting it. Another way of putting it is that OP wants husband to fork over a year and a quarter's worth of savings so they can party for a few hours.", "I was looking for a comment like this before posting my own. Absolutely right, it's apparent they have separate accounts and it seems for a good reason too. Also the fact she brings up how his family is well off and he's worked to be independent shows he understands the value of money. When he said \"he didn't have that money\", she had to point out that HE has double, which in his mind is already allotted ergo not exactly \"free money\". \n\nThey say money is the root for many divorces, if they cannot get on the same page financially , there will definitely be some resentment and/or difficult decisions about their coupledom in the future.  The fact she's already trying to guilt him is a clear sign she doesn't value what he's doing for their future. If she did, there would have been much better forms of communication trying to think of a different solution. Many said have others chip in and have like a \"party fund\" and that would be the gift, a fun celebration.", "This is what I was thinking!  OP is YTA.  That HUGE family of hers could all contribute to dad $50-100 and it sounds like he would have enough in no time.  Or, they could have a low key celebration and just be happy to have his health.", "Right? Like I though the ask was gonna be like $500 for a tree, some decor and a ham. Not $3000?! That's an insane amount of money to borrow for a Christmas party. (And now that I say that, I doubt it's all going to the christmas party)", "This is right.  Each person can bring a food dish and a drink.  No one should ever be borrowing money for a party and their priorities are messed up.  If people won't agree to bringing the food and everything else, then the parents don't need to host a party.\n\nAlso, are the parents planning on buying everyone a gift?  That's also not in the cards when you can't even afford to host a partty.", "Op is also making very bad financial choices. Her husband has worked for THREE years to save $7k (and that money is an investment in their future).\n\nThe money you\u2019re asking for $3k is not something that Op and her husband will be able to replace quickly (and her parents won\u2019t be able to pay it back).", "Exactly! And where\u2019s OP\u2019s contribution from her \u2018fun money\u2019", "This is an excellent point. Why doesn't every member of this huge family pitch in their money to get their dream Christmas and celebrate their family members health? Hell, I've seen Christmas movies with worse scripts then this!\n\nYTA, op. You're asking a big amount of money from your husband. You are dismissing your husband's dream and his very reasonable financial concerns.\n\nAnd to boot, you're trying to punish him for enforcing totally relatedable and reasonable boundaries.", "How much do you want to bet the money is not for Christmas but to help with their medical debt?", "I'm trying to figure out where all that money would go?! I know it's a lot of people, but just set it up potluck style and food will be covered. If it's really about gathering the family, small gifts will be completely fine. This is insane to me.", "The father coming up with the \"idea\" of ASKING HIS SON IN LAW FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS is laughable. And not to pay their debt, just to buy presents.", "Exactly. I think OP is more concerned about looking like the hero who saved Christmas than anything else. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t do a budget Christmas. Certain years my family did the one gift per person thing due to financial issues. No one ever complained and quite frankly i think Christmas is more for the kids gifts. Im fine just being with family and enjoying their company.", "This. Either all the adults chip in some money for dinner, or they have a pot luck and everyone brings a dish. Maybe instead of a bunch of gifts they do a secret Santa so everyone gets one, or even just the kids. And explain the greatest gift is grandma and grandpa still being alive this year.\n\nYTA I've had fancy Christmases at grandmas and poor Christmases at grandmas. I look back fondly on both", "Will it be one time though? Or will this come up again next year? Big families with no financial control will bleed themselves dry, I can see them turning on him if he asks about repayments.", "Lending money to family is a sure fire way to never get paid back.", "On top of this why isnt op offering her own 3k?\n\nWhy not just bring them to your house to celebrate\n\nWhy give them money? Instead give them the means to do better\n\nThey sound like moochers a d by your own admission are in terrible medical debt\n\nGrow up. Sometimes you have to do without to live, sucks but its true", "I can only imagine the conflict that would arise later on if he did lend them the money and they weren\u2019t able to pay it back. \n\n\u201cAITA? My parents haven\u2019t paid back my husband the thousands of dollars he lent them two years ago, and now he doesn\u2019t have the money to invest in his business. But I don\u2019t want to confront my parents about it because it\u2019s not their fault they had other debts to pay off!\u201d", "And to say he is well off with 7k in savings, in some bluntness that is not a lot of money. In one emergency that money is gone. I would think you need to have 6 figures in the bank to even be close to being called well off. YTA", "It's obscene to me that OP wants to shell out almost half of her husband's savings for a 24 hour event. That's crazy. I can't believe she isn't on his side.\n\nThe other crazy thing is that OPs dad feels awkward asking his family for help but has no problem asking his son in law. Terrible priorities here", "What are the odds that, if OP's husband did lend them the money, the father would soon come up with the idea that the money could be a Christmas present for them???\nI can totally see it happening.", "Exactly. In a few months, the party will be forgotten, and husband will then be \u201cselfish and cruel\u201d for asking for his money back when he knows the parents are struggling. YTA.", "I'm thinking it's not just medical debt tbh. Sounds like she has no understanding of finances and it's possible it stems from her parents. I hate making assumptions like that, but if the father throwing a party is more important than getting his medical debts laid down... Something's not quite adding up.", "It doesn't surprise me at all. \n\nOur family spending patterns greatly impact our own view of money. Kids who have parents who spend 3k on Christmas would likely be spenders themselves. \n\nIt sounds like this couple has very little in savings themselves, but the husband is trying to rectify that. 7k is practically nothing if that is all he has in savings. Her husband is completely correct not to squander that.", "OP said she's a student with no job. That makes it even worse.", "OP wants $3000 of the $7000 her husband has saved. Like WHAT? For a Christmas party?! Insanity. Absolutely insane. If he has saved $3,000,000 and OP's parents were financially stable again, I could see asking for help, but almost half his savings with unlikely payback?!", "right? have a potluck. I do get that it's tough to feel like you can't give kids the Christmas presents they expect (which is the only way I can conceive of this costing $3K), but you can make a game out of it. Do secret santa instead of everyone gets a gift, encouraging the kids to come up with creative homemade gifts. \n\nOP's fam is in a rough but not insurmountable nor uncommon situation--and this is NOT the solution."]}
