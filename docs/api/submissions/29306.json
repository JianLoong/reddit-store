To said gathering, she brought her 3(ish)-month-old daughter, who happens to have a pretty common name, \"Emma\" (both fake names for privacy)\n\nOn my hand, I happened to meet a girl, also an Emma, when I started this year at college. I won't give to much detail to keep the post brief, but not much after I met her, I knew she was pretty much everything I've ever wanted in a girlfriend. Two months before this meeting, I finally got to start dating her, and it's been going good so far.\n\nSo of course, when asked about my love life, I had to mention this girl, poking a bit of fun to both my girlfriend and my niece having the same name, thinking there wouldn't be a problem.  After all, I had met the girl before I even knew this baby existed, and like I said, the name's pretty common.\n\nWell, my cousin apparently didn't agree with me. She got somewhat angry with me, and said \"Why did you have to choose someone with the same name as my child? Couldn't you date anyone else??\". To that, of course, I replied what I mentioned before. She still wasn't convinced, and had a sour face for the rest of the dinner. Tbh I didn't take it personally,  and I figured she would get over it soon enough.\n\nHowever, this last couple of days she started texting me over and over, pestering me about this. She even called me yesterday to talk about it, and mentioned that she didn't want my gf to meet her or her daughter, since it would make them uncomfortable. At that point, I snapped and told her that she didn't have a claim over the name \"Emma\", and to get over herself. She of course started calling me a bunch of names, and I soon hung up.\n\nWhen I talked about this with my GF, she said she didn't agree with my cousin, but she understood where she came from. My mom, on the other hand, said she's not gonna get involved in my relationship, but I shouldn't get into fights with my family. The rest of my relatives' opinions are similarly mixed.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do here? Everyone seems to imply that I have to choose between dmping my girlfriend or getting to spend time with my niece. I feel this is ridiculous, and that I shouldn't have to choose. Is there a way to fix this?
