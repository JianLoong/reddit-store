I'm never okay with the idea of using children as weapons, and unless there's danger, abuse, direct disrespect of the parents' rules, etc, I'm certainly not okay with the idea of keeping grandparents and their grandchildren apart. Your kids are close to them, don't punish your kids for the beef between you and your parents. That would make YTA.", "Yep you can\u2019t please people who want to be the victim", "But are they really taking advantage?

Later they complained that she was gone too much, and they seemed to be overwhelmed, but they also don\u2019t seem to want to share the labor. There is definitely some ambivalence there. Childcare for littles is a hard job for seniors, but communication is better than talking behind your back or guilt trips. NTA. \n\nYou have to be clear that consistency is important. Otherwise, your kids may be more stimulated in a preschool and daycare environment, if they are worn out. Maybe they need to only babysit occasionally, when you have an evening out or weekend away.", "If you and your wife are comfortable with it, invite the grandparents over for lunch and to hang out with the kids, but in your presence. This is actually so the kids don't get upset about not seeing their grandparents.

It doesn't say anything about her having bad behavior with the kids before this.  Sometimes healthy people have arguments and make mistakes.  LI'd like to give them all the benefit of the doubt and realize that OP got his feelings hurt and Grandma was worn out and exhausted and communications were not as great as it should have been. I have a feeling that there's more to the story.  And that maybe grandma was being taken advantage of a little and OP was busy making a living and didn't notice it. It happens it doesn't make any of it right but yes how you work it out that matters.  If OP isn't ready to spend time with his mom then let the kids get to see her. Kids have a lot to deal with the more people that can be around to live them and help them the better.", "You're a good sister. Sorry your mom sucks. And hearty congratulations for refusing to play the game. It can be pretty scary standing up to these ogres.", "Just for the record do what works for you. My FIL asked early on when our daughter was at daycare if he could take her to dance class once a week which we were like \u201csure you can pick her up any time. Just let us know when so we don\u2019t worry\u201d\n\nWhat he actually wanted was for us to take her out of daycare early to facilitate a drop off at an agreed location (because he didn\u2019t want to drive and park down town and deal with the daycare security because it was in a federal building - which neither of us worked in) so he could take her at like 2-3pm for the rest of the day. Which would have meant we would have to leave work early to make this happen for not an insignificant amount of time. He also didn\u2019t want to commit to taking her all day 1-2x per week (which would have saved us money and therefore much more willing to do) because he really just wanted her for a few hours.\n\nNeedless to say this did not happen and our kid did not take dance lessons at 2 mid week.", "But that punishes the kids.

Maybe they would like to be paid.", "I can just imagine all the nasty things that the kids can overhear their grandparents and their aunt say about their mother and father. Did you forget that these people were literally talking shit behind their backs?  They offered to babysit, acted like everything was absolutely fine to the parent's face and then talked shit with their daughter about her brother and his wife.  Then when OP said something to them about this they talk shit to him to his face, insulted him and pretty much told him he was a shit parent. They didn't even have the common decency to let him know that they no longer wanted to babysit and it was becoming a burden. Talk about not acting like grown ups.  I don't think I'd want my kids around people like that...grandparents or not.", "That's unfortunate. I siblings and I used to all argue, just childhood drama but we communicate now and if my parents ever say anything they'll just ask me about it they won't accuse me.

If your parents want to visit their grandchildren, have them over when you and your wife are there. That way, they can't complain/claim that they are being used as unpaid babysitters.\n3.

Maybe they feel that there would be ways for you to spend more time with the kids if you modified how or when you worked. \nMaybe they were getting sisters impressions of the situation because they know that it isn't always easy to be objectif. \n\nI still think that it is unfair to say that you won't let them sit again.

Your reaction upon learning they resented the arrangement was to end it, once again completely complying with their desires.  If Julia wants to see her grandparents she can, but on visits or outings, not in an all day daycare setting; OP never said he cut off contact, just stopped the daycare arrangement which was the cause of the conflict.\n\nHow exactly is OP \"taking advantage\" of his parents when he is relieving them from the task of daycare, which they TOLD sister they resented?

The only thing he's complained about is how it hurt his feelings that she didn't think he was taking care of his kids properly. I'm not sure how his mom watching his kids for years is her stepping on him. Her delivery was horrible.

Send them to daycare and something bad could happen to them you had no control over. Keep sending them to your parents and parents could teach them some of what they were saying to Sister. If it were me I would have a long heart to heart talk with them and decide how much is too much, how much is not enough, and come up with a plan somewhere in the middle.

It\u2019s been 4 years of this schedule pretty regularly with a part of it being with a baby. They definitely got aches and pains they aren\u2019t telling you about.

I would also tell them that you expect an apology for insulting you to third parties without ever bringing up their apparent discontent with you, and make it clear that if you ever get a whiff of them saying something in front of the kids, they will never see their grandkids again.\n\nThey need to learn to communicate like adults if they want to be in your life, and you should make this incredibly clear.

That they are taking advantage of the willingness to help from the grandparents and contrary to what op says it isn't just when they are both working. That or they could choose different work hours but deliberately choose to work at the same time because grandparents can take the kids. I don't just believe what ops say. I also don't judge people I have no information about and I don't know their side. \nPeopleneed to be more critical about what an op says.\nThey are going to write what happened to make themselves look good or better. They are likely going to exaggerate or minimise actions/events/words. They will leave out \"details\" that don't go in their direction. They will sometimes not know everything themselves and not know it. \nSometimes even considering all of these things it is a clear cut situation but so often it isn't and many times if people push a lot with the right questions, op reveals that crucial missing point but not always."]}
