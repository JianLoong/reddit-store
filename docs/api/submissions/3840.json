Kill them with kindness.", "They want to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nBe with the grandkids, but also play the victim to others like \"Oh it's so hard when you have such an irresponsible child who pawns of his own child on us, but we manage somehow\"", "OP should still keep the kids away from them (at least for solo visits) because the grandparents cannot be trusted to not be disrespectful and r self-aggrandizing shits.", "I would guess that sometimes they want the pleasure of being the rescuing parents, so they volunteer to babysit, and sometimes they want the pleasure of being the martyred parents, so they bitch about it.\n\nFrankly your kids don't need that kind of thing in their lives.", "So...you need to 'take responsibility', but now that you're doing exactly what they want you're the asshole?\n\nNah man, just keep doing this. They wanted this, you're just respecting their wishes by not having the kids over.", "They can see the kids on holidays and family times when you are there with them. That seems to be the only grand parenting they want to do.", "Supervised visits - don't let either of your parents be alone with your children.", "I would say allowing the kids to still visit with them for a weekend afternoon here and there is normal and reasonable. They would still know them without you \u201cpawning them off\u201d. Get them both into a good daycare for the week and I would settle it as maybe 1-2 weekend afternoons a month for visits. Thats just my opinion after reading all comments and the post.", "You really should never leave them alone with them. Because they will either verbally or nonverbally undercut you.", "Keeping your daughters away from toxic people (at least not w/o a parent) is not hurting the girls; it's protecting them.", "OP did try to talk to his mother; she insisted he was wrong. Using grown-up words is necessary but not sufficient because the OP's mother needed to use them too. If the OP could stand it w/o barfing, the parents could bring their daughters to visit the Martyr grandparents every single day but not unsupervised. If the grandparents do something to regain trust, then the OP could change the arrangements, but not the way that things stand.", "Agreed! The entire we are so perfect and don't take advantage ever and then this so called random and surprising reaction don't jive", "Ah. NVM.", "This was my thought too. It was a mutually beneficial relationship where op got to save money on childcare and their parents got to bond more with their grandchildren. It served nothing other than their ego to lie about why they were helping out. I doubt they actually think op is irresponsible they just didn't think the gossip would ever come back to them.", "Loansharking favors", "Narcissist was my first thought. I never knew which way to turn with my mom, constant 180's, contradiction, made me feel like I was crazy til I figured it out. \nFeels like she was just gossiping about how put out she was and when you caught her running her mouth,  instead of apologizing she doubled down.", "They did figure it out. The grandparents said by allowing them to babysit, op and wife are deadbeat parents. So, OP made other arrangements. The grandparents made it abundantly clear they did not want to babysit anymore. So now they don\u2019t. Problem solved. They can\u2019t have it all their own way.", "Because they didn't ask for any compromise, they just wanted to bitch about OP.", "If circumstances changed, I would assume that the OP\u2019s parents still have a functioning mouth, considering they were flapping it to the sister while they were complaining. NTA", "Probably jealous. You are out having a nice life probably. Nothing wrong with daycare. Our kids go 5 days a week. And grandma helps evenings and weekends. It takes a village and kids that socialize more will network better in the modern economy.", ">they are pissed because they now want to watch the kids. Smh\n\nThey can't play martyr if they're not being 'put upon'.", "They want to have the kids over exactly when they want and exactly how long they want, and they want it to be a big favor they're doing OP. \n\nAnything that deviate from that, such as babysitting on OP's schedule or OP being perfectly happy to hire a babysitter, is OP being a terrible ungrateful brat who is taking advantage of his poor parents. Simple, right?", "No. Don\u2019t give them the option. They get to see the kids during holidays and family dinners when both parents are present. And that\u2019s it.", "Plus the sister is irritated as well. There's the missing missing happening here.", "Manipulation is a key part of abuse. Grandmother was getting very close to that line. Better to stop the solo visits before it gets that far.", "And that's the part that I don't understand. They were literally watching the kids so that you could go back to work and then they talked shit about you to your sister behind your back. If they were my parents they wouldn't see their grandchildren anymore...fuck them. I can't wait for one of my kids to give me grandchildren and I would gladly baby sit them for free while they were at work anytime they wanted me to.", "I kind of get where they're coming from. They'd rather have the kids then you leaving them with a nanny or something. They think you're just not spending enough time with the kids.. that's what it comes down to.\n\nNAH also if you take away your kids from their loving grandparents because of something that can be talked through that's you punishing yourselves, them, the kids... \n\nPeople here want to fuck up your life, they really don't want what's best for you or your kids lol They just want what's petty and over the top.", "They just want something to moan about and maybe get some sympathy. Alot of grandparents do this, offer/insist on doing too much then moan about it but won't admit they are too old to take it all on.", "power (limited, but they are AHs....)", "To have a second chance after screwing up their own kids. Toxic. OP, NTA.", "or like in my parents' case, they don't care. \n\nI wonder what r/aitachildcare 's mother said when asked why she lied about wanting to watch them?", "This is a life changing event for the whole family, so if they want to be permanently estranged then yeah I guess they figured it out.  Too devastating to think this should be the final outcome.", "Isn't this a time where they can teach their kids to show some empathy? Don't we all get fed up with our jobs once and a while? We all loose our temper. We are all worn down and tired after working long weeks. I don't think it should be a life sentence for the everyone because the grandparents were complaining. We don't know what was going on to make the grandparents all the sudden feel overwhelmed and resentful. I can definitely understand the OPs frustration. By why not try to be the bigger person and say sorry that is become too much for you guys. Give everyone the option of what works for them. It doesn' t need to be all or nothing. Maybe they were feeding dinner to the kids and that was what was overwhelming. So if that's the case offer to work around that.  It's clear that everyone loves the kids and wants what's best for them but not at the expense of the grandparents health and happiness.", "This is it, this is the comment I was looking for - they just wanted to play martyr to OP\u2019s sister.", "I\u2019d also argue that Grandma is one of the primary caregivers since she looked after the girls every week multiple times. She\u2019s not just Grandma, she\u2019s in loco parentis and the girls will see her differently to a regular grandma who they see monthly. Totally NTA. Never leave your kids with people who are making accusations of neglect or abuse or poor parenting when there is none.", "This feels like the grandparents want to be seen/feel like both saviors and martyrs", "Just an add-on your sister sucks, siblings should have each other's back especially when a parent turns on one of their kids for stupid and illegitimate reason. NTA but your parents and sister are big ones", "Soooo many people who just choose to gripe about complaints as their default conversational mode, to the point of pretending to be more put out than they really are so they can gripe longer and in detail", "It isn\u2019t like they are estranged. They just don\u2019t get solo time with the kids. They see the kids when they see OP.", "Or maybe OP's parents are assholes."]}
