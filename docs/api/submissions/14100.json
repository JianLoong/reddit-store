My nephew & 2 of his other friends from school that lived in the same neighborhood tagged along as well.\n\nWhen we got to the park, Jaiden and his friends started playing. I started filming them playing and noticed some of the parents there were looking at me weirdly. I was confused until I realized that I probably looked weird because I was recording kids at the park. Yeah, there were other kids at the park - it was packed - but I tried to not get them in the video.\n\nAnyway, I stopped recording and just hung out there to keep an eye on Jaiden. Twenty minutes later, two women approached me and asked what I was doing at the park. I told them I was there with my nephew Jaiden and his friends - I took him to the park.\n\nAfter I said this, they had the audacity to say  \"Prove that I'm his uncle.\" At this point, I was already pissed off because I knew what they were implying. I told them to fuck off and leave me alone - I didn't have to prove shit to them.\n\nThey refused to leave me alone and threatened to call the park security or whatever they're called. I then had no choice but to call Jaiden over and confirm that he was actually my nephew. These girls literally asked my nephew if he was sure if he knew me. Like, what the fuck?\n\nI asked them why they were accusing me of being a creep or whatever and they said it was because I'm a man and I looked sketchy - a kid was recently abducted in the area by a man before, so they were hyper-vigilant about it.\n\nI asked them how the fuck do I look sketchy? I had to pull the race card because, other than my skin color, I don't see how I look creepy. I had a blue polo shirt on with black jeans and a black jacket.\n\nThey refused to answer and then they wanted me to delete the video recording I had off of my phone. I refused and cursed at them, took my nephew and his friends home, and told my female friend what had happened. She agreed that I was too aggressive and should have complied because the women were just trying to make sure I wasn't a creep because a child was recently kidnapped from that area. \n\nWas I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1680738464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12d29j5/aita_for_getting_aggressive_because_2_women_at/", "score": 2133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Back when I nannied I ended up becoming acquainted with several other nannies and parents who were regularly at the neighborhood park. One of the other nannies I met was a Black male college kid who cared for a little boy and girl who were about the same ages as the kids I watched. We would often schedule park meetups so the kids could play together and we could take turns watching them if we needed to take one to the bathroom or whatever. He was an awesome nanny and my family ended up using him as a secondary sitter for days I was unavailable. One day my toddler had a diaper blowout right before we were supposed to leave to meet them at the park, so we were running pretty late. When I got there there was some woman I\u2019d never seen before all up in his face yelling. I thought maybe there had been some incident with the kids (his older kid had gotten in trouble the week before for hitting another kid with a stick so something like that wouldn\u2019t have been surprising) Turns out she was accusing him of \u201chaving no business being in the park\u201d and wouldn\u2019t believe that he was the nanny. He refused to call the kids over because he, rightly, said that they didn\u2019t need to be involved or have their innocent playtime interrupted with her racist and disgusting behavior- which of course only set her off more. She only backed down when I (a white woman) arrived and confirmed he was their nanny and that we\u2019d be calling the cops if she didn\u2019t stop harassing him. But even then she felt the need to continue lecturing him for being \u201caggressive\u201d. That really pissed me off because while he was visibly angry, he was speaking very calmly and deliberately, though he wasn\u2019t holding back on calling her out on her bs. He was in no way being \u201caggressive\u201d - he was standing his ground. By the time she finally ended her tirade, the kids had definitely noticed and run over and the little girl he watched was clinging to his leg, crying and asking why the mean lady was yelling at him. Those kids loved the crap out of him and to see some woman lose her shit at him was really upsetting for them. Turns out she wasn\u2019t even at the playground with kids either- hers were in swimming lessons at the pool next to it and she\u2019d been watching him through the fence until she\u2019d decided to walk all the way around and confront him. We ended up leaving the park early and taking the kids for ice cream instead. We met up to grab a beer after we both got off work so he could vent and he told me all about how that kind of thing happened all the time- though usually not to the degree of having a stranger screaming in his face, and how effed up it is that if I hadn\u2019t been late it probably never would have gone down like that. \n\nYou had every right to not comply, and personally I feel like cursing is warranted in some situations- the way these women treated you went beyond any reasonable suspicion of dangerous men in the park. At the very LEAST, once they had confirmation from your nephew that you were in fact his uncle, they should have apologized and then walked away. They had no business asking you to delete the video and should have gone back to minding their own damn business. And sorry, but I\u2019ve seen an actual sketchy looking guy at the park- we knew he was sketchy because he literally had his hands down his pants while hiding behind some bushes.

Pulling the race card cause there couldn\u2019t possibly be another reason when you\u2019ve admitted filming in the park that a kid has recently been abducted in.", "NTA   I recently had my BIL point out to me that he was unable to approach and offer help to an injured child at a park without raising suspicion, despite being a parent, while I was simply because of my gender. This came up after I helped a child who fell out of a tree and landed right in front of me during a walk. My BIL said that he likely would have had to keep on walking or look for a woman to help him help the child. I doubt that he would have ignored the child, but he wouldn't have been able to approach the child alone despite it literally landing at his feet. He also said that was likely the same reason people around me at the park (mostly men but some women) refused to make eye contact with me while I tried to help the child. They figured no one is going to be suspicious of the white blue-eyed blonde girl but they'll be suspicious of me if I step in to help too. I think, and some people may disagree, that if they had just approached you because you were filming, they didn't recognize you, and that they normally saw someone else accompanying your nephew to the park, especially since there had been a recent kidnapping in the area, that it would be ok. They would still have needed to do a big apology afterwards and maybe give you a little aside about how unsafe everyone felt after the kidnapping. They might even have introduced themselves after that and pointed out their own children so that you could look out for each other. They could have even told you that no one is really comfortable with anyone doing any filming at the park with other kids in the background because of it and politely ask that you delete any video their kids might be in, even if it's just in the background. And then blame the kidnapping. But that's not what they did at all. These two women approached you well after the filming, they had 20 minutes to observe you interacting with your nephew and his friends and made comments about your appearance and used vague terms like \"you look sketchy\". They refused to believe your nephew's confirmations that the two of you were related. Threatened to call some sort of authority and wouldn't back down even when they were proven wrong. It also doesn't seem like they knew or recognized your nephew or his friends at all. Did they approach anyone else at the park that day? Did they approach any women? OR were you the only person they thought was suspicious that day?  What would have happened if you didn't stick up for yourself? NTA at all.", "NTA", "Fuck people like this.

On the other hand, safeguarding children is more important than an adult's feelings, and parents are well within their right to not want their kids recorded or photographed at the park. It's fair for an adult recording kids at the park to be a red flag to parents at that park. We don't live in an ideal world, there are predators our there. But it's very difficult to know at what point to step in and start asking questions. I feel like maybe OP was too aggressive in their responses. There was no way for those women to know that a man filming kids at the park wasn't a random creep, and again, they probably care more about child safety than about OP's feelings (and rightly so). But it does become an issue if they ONLY direct this suspicion towards men (especially since women are often used as lures, since people usually trust them more). So I'm finding this one to be a very tough call. Did they question OP because he was filming children? Or did they question OP because he was a MAN filming children?", "Right?
