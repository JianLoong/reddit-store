She promised to take him after school but she got sick so she asked me too do it. I accepted since I had nothing to do that day. She also asked me to film my nephew playing so I said sure. My nephew & 2 of his other friends from school that lived in the same neighborhood tagged along as well.\n\nWhen we got to the park, Jaiden and his friends started playing. I started filming them playing and noticed some of the parents there were looking at me weirdly. I was confused until I realized that I probably looked weird because I was recording kids at the park. Yeah, there were other kids at the park - it was packed - but I tried to not get them in the video.\n\nAnyway, I stopped recording and just hung out there to keep an eye on Jaiden. Twenty minutes later, two women approached me and asked what I was doing at the park. I told them I was there with my nephew Jaiden and his friends - I took him to the park.\n\nAfter I said this, they had the audacity to say  \"Prove that I'm his uncle.\" At this point, I was already pissed off because I knew what they were implying. I told them to fuck off and leave me alone - I didn't have to prove shit to them.\n\nThey refused to leave me alone and threatened to call the park security or whatever they're called. I then had no choice but to call Jaiden over and confirm that he was actually my nephew. These girls literally asked my nephew if he was sure if he knew me. Like, what the fuck?\n\nI asked them why they were accusing me of being a creep or whatever and they said it was because I'm a man and I looked sketchy - a kid was recently abducted in the area by a man before, so they were hyper-vigilant about it.\n\nI asked them how the fuck do I look sketchy? I had to pull the race card because, other than my skin color, I don't see how I look creepy. I had a blue polo shirt on with black jeans and a black jacket.\n\nThey refused to answer and then they wanted me to delete the video recording I had off of my phone. I refused and cursed at them, took my nephew and his friends home, and told my female friend what had happened. She agreed that I was too aggressive and should have complied because the women were just trying to make sure I wasn't a creep because a child was recently kidnapped from that area. \n\nWas I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1680738464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12d29j5/aita_for_getting_aggressive_because_2_women_at/", "score": 961, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They also stupid. Women abduct kids too. So them being on the look out for men is absurd.", "Adamently NTA. You had every right to be angry and respond accordingly. Back when I nannied I ended up becoming acquainted with several other nannies and parents who were regularly at the neighborhood park. One of the other nannies I met was a Black male college kid who cared for a little boy and girl who were about the same ages as the kids I watched. We would often schedule park meetups so the kids could play together and we could take turns watching them if we needed to take one to the bathroom or whatever. He was an awesome nanny and my family ended up using him as a secondary sitter for days I was unavailable. One day my toddler had a diaper blowout right before we were supposed to leave to meet them at the park, so we were running pretty late. When I got there there was some woman I\u2019d never seen before all up in his face yelling. I thought maybe there had been some incident with the kids (his older kid had gotten in trouble the week before for hitting another kid with a stick so something like that wouldn\u2019t have been surprising) Turns out she was accusing him of \u201chaving no business being in the park\u201d and wouldn\u2019t believe that he was the nanny. He refused to call the kids over because he, rightly, said that they didn\u2019t need to be involved or have their innocent playtime interrupted with her racist and disgusting behavior- which of course only set her off more. She only backed down when I (a white woman) arrived and confirmed he was their nanny and that we\u2019d be calling the cops if she didn\u2019t stop harassing him. But even then she felt the need to continue lecturing him for being \u201caggressive\u201d. That really pissed me off because while he was visibly angry, he was speaking very calmly and deliberately, though he wasn\u2019t holding back on calling her out on her bs. He was in no way being \u201caggressive\u201d - he was standing his ground. By the time she finally ended her tirade, the kids had definitely noticed and run over and the little girl he watched was clinging to his leg, crying and asking why the mean lady was yelling at him. Those kids loved the crap out of him and to see some woman lose her shit at him was really upsetting for them. Turns out she wasn\u2019t even at the playground with kids either- hers were in swimming lessons at the pool next to it and she\u2019d been watching him through the fence until she\u2019d decided to walk all the way around and confront him. We ended up leaving the park early and taking the kids for ice cream instead. We met up to grab a beer after we both got off work so he could vent and he told me all about how that kind of thing happened all the time- though usually not to the degree of having a stranger screaming in his face, and how effed up it is that if I hadn\u2019t been late it probably never would have gone down like that. \n\nYou had every right to not comply, and personally I feel like cursing is warranted in some situations- the way these women treated you went beyond any reasonable suspicion of dangerous men in the park. At the very LEAST, once they had confirmation from your nephew that you were in fact his uncle, they should have apologized and then walked away. They had no business asking you to delete the video and should have gone back to minding their own damn business. And sorry, but I\u2019ve seen an actual sketchy looking guy at the park- we knew he was sketchy because he literally had his hands down his pants while hiding behind some bushes. I would never dream of confronting any random male who just happens to be at the park without something more to go on than him just existing.

There were even times the strangers got mad when she didn't give them the kind of answer they expected (saying things like, \"I do it for free, if I didn't I'd get arrested for neglect,\" stuff like that) and they'd threaten to call the cops bc all of a sudden and for some \"unknown\" reason, it now somehow seemed suspicious that she's got a pale ass baby in her care \ud83d\ude44 \n\nThey'll use whatever reason they can think of to justify it, but in the end, they were the ones in the wrong, and now that they feel stupid, they wanna make someone else pay for their mistake.", "Excellent idea to call the police.", "If you\u2019re feeling extra petty one day: My husband likes to tell the story of how I died and now he has to take care of \u201cthese boys all alone\u201d. \n\nApparently it shuts people up real quick.", ">They could've just called security and let security confirm that you're being safe.\n\nThis.", "I mean... welcome in a society where its supposed to be a woman's job to take care of kids.
