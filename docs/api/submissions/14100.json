{"id": 14100, "submission_id": "12d29j5", "title": "AITA for getting aggressive because 2 women at the park wouldn't leave me alone?", "selftext": " \n\nYesterday, my sister asked me to take my nephew Jaiden to the park. She promised to take him after school but she got sick so she asked me too do it. I accepted since I had nothing to do that day. She also asked me to film my nephew playing so I said sure. My nephew & 2 of his other friends from school that lived in the same neighborhood tagged along as well.\n\nWhen we got to the park, Jaiden and his friends started playing. I started filming them playing and noticed some of the parents there were looking at me weirdly. I was confused until I realized that I probably looked weird because I was recording kids at the park. Yeah, there were other kids at the park - it was packed - but I tried to not get them in the video.\n\nAnyway, I stopped recording and just hung out there to keep an eye on Jaiden. Twenty minutes later, two women approached me and asked what I was doing at the park. I told them I was there with my nephew Jaiden and his friends - I took him to the park.\n\nAfter I said this, they had the audacity to say  \"Prove that I'm his uncle.\" At this point, I was already pissed off because I knew what they were implying. I told them to fuck off and leave me alone - I didn't have to prove shit to them.\n\nThey refused to leave me alone and threatened to call the park security or whatever they're called. I then had no choice but to call Jaiden over and confirm that he was actually my nephew. These girls literally asked my nephew if he was sure if he knew me. Like, what the fuck?\n\nI asked them why they were accusing me of being a creep or whatever and they said it was because I'm a man and I looked sketchy - a kid was recently abducted in the area by a man before, so they were hyper-vigilant about it.\n\nI asked them how the fuck do I look sketchy? I had to pull the race card because, other than my skin color, I don't see how I look creepy. I had a blue polo shirt on with black jeans and a black jacket.\n\nThey refused to answer and then they wanted me to delete the video recording I had off of my phone. I refused and cursed at them, took my nephew and his friends home, and told my female friend what had happened. She agreed that I was too aggressive and should have complied because the women were just trying to make sure I wasn't a creep because a child was recently kidnapped from that area. \n\nWas I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1680738464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12d29j5/aita_for_getting_aggressive_because_2_women_at/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was very calm and articulate when the police arrived and it was hilarious when the cops turned on them and told them to stop harassing strangers in public. \n\nThe two of them weren't even at the park with kids.

A lot of people take pictures and videos of kids they take to the park. This is not by itself creepy behavior. Once your nephew confirmed you were legit, that should have ended the situation.
