Wow.", "YTA\n\nCoeliac here. \nHe was making a snack for himself. He doesn't have to cater to you all the time. I would never tell my partner he has to make something gluten free so I can eat it too. We just make our own food and snacks. I find it sad your husband has to sneak around just to have some damn cookies. \n\nIf you were worried about cross contamination, sure I would understand and would suggest he deep clean everything after he's done but your not.\n\nStop policing his food and let the man make his own gluten snacks.", "Oh bless him.

You didn't ask for or express interest in cookies so why should he make them with you in mind. It sounds like your house is primarily gluten free so it is completely unfair to expect him to not be able to treat himself every now and then.", "YTA.  I've done GF cooking for my husband and friends for years.  While some adaptations are better than others, GF rarely is the flavor/texture I desire for some items.  So, I get your husband's desire to have wheat based cookies.  Why would you object to this?  He's certainly entitled to enjoy them still in spite of your not eating them.  I don't see where it is a big slight to you that he desires this.  Acknowledge that likely he usually eats GF for you, not because it's his preference.  \n\nSo, it's not always about you.  Let him have his cookies and eat them the way he likes them sometimes.", "YTA.  Feel free to make your own cookies so you and your husband can have a snack together.

Everything that gets baked in my house is gluten free. That being said, I don\u2019t tell my husband he can\u2019t have gluten containing foods just because I can\u2019t eat them - he just has to acquire them outside the house (he can eat them here, he just can\u2019t make them here because I don\u2019t want my equipment contaminated).

What's stopping you from making your own cookies, just like he did?", "YTA.  \"If I can't eat it then you shouldn't either!\" \n\nYou're saying that he can't have anything unless you get some too.  That's pretty selfish.", "INFO: Was he using separate cooking equipment or was he using things that you also use? How well did he scrub down the kitchen after cooking? What is your normal policy on cooking with wheat in your house?", "YTA. Make your own snack. I think it's safe to assume (because I've dealt with living with someone who is celiac) that all your meals are made gluten free because it is just easier to do than making separate meals. So he's already accommodating for you with everything else. And I totally understand your situation is shitty not being able to eat gluten. But you still have someone who (once again I'm just making the assumption, unless you guys cook two separate dishes for your meals) has to eat gluten free meals along with you. Let him enjoy his own damn snack. Or ask nicely if he wouldn't mind making or help making a batch of gluten free cookies.", "YTA and he needs to leave your ass", "YTA.  Those cookies were not for you.  Those cookies were for him.   If you want cookies, you make gluten free cookies for yourself.", "Celiacs can get sick from wheat flour being used because it gets in the air and then can be inhaled and goes from your mucus membranes to your digestive tract, so honestly ESH for having flour in their home.", "ESH.\n\nAlso have Celiac. You both are failing to be considerate of each other here.\n\nHubs absolutely should have his own food, BUT he should do so SAFELY. Wheat flour in a kitchen with a Celiac? That is gonna get EVERYWHERE, cross contaminate your dishes, and you breathing that in is also not good for you. So he sucks for not considering the risk of getting you sick by cooking with it.\n\nYou absolutely should be able to expect your own kitchen is safe and for your spouse to consider your safety while cooking. HOWEVER, you can\u2019t forbid him from ever eating gluten again- that\u2019s just controlling. He should be able to SAFELY consume gluten food when he wants (ex: hubs is gf with me 99% of the time BY HIS CHOICE but also keeps beer and poptarts and eats gluten meals when we dine out, which is as it should be!)\n\nSit down, have a conversation, and try to work out a middle ground here OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
