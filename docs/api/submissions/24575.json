You didn't ask for or express interest in cookies so why should he make them with you in mind. It sounds like your house is primarily gluten free so it is completely unfair to expect him to not be able to treat himself every now and then.", "YTA.  I've done GF cooking for my husband and friends for years.  While some adaptations are better than others, GF rarely is the flavor/texture I desire for some items.  So, I get your husband's desire to have wheat based cookies.  Why would you object to this?  He's certainly entitled to enjoy them still in spite of your not eating them.  I don't see where it is a big slight to you that he desires this.  Acknowledge that likely he usually eats GF for you, not because it's his preference.  \n\nSo, it's not always about you.

Everything that gets baked in my house is gluten free.

What is your normal policy on cooking with wheat in your house?", "YTA. Make your own snack. I think it's safe to assume (because I've dealt with living with someone who is celiac) that all your meals are made gluten free because it is just easier to do than making separate meals. So he's already accommodating for you with everything else. And I totally understand your situation is shitty not being able to eat gluten. But you still have someone who (once again I'm just making the assumption, unless you guys cook two separate dishes for your meals) has to eat gluten free meals along with you.

You both are failing to be considerate of each other here.\n\nHubs absolutely should have his own food, BUT he should do so SAFELY. Wheat flour in a kitchen with a Celiac? That is gonna get EVERYWHERE, cross contaminate your dishes, and you breathing that in is also not good for you. So he sucks for not considering the risk of getting you sick by cooking with it.\n\nYou absolutely should be able to expect your own kitchen is safe and for your spouse to consider your safety while cooking. HOWEVER, you can\u2019t forbid him from ever eating gluten again- that\u2019s just controlling. He should be able to SAFELY consume gluten food when he wants (ex: hubs is gf with me 99% of the time BY HIS CHOICE but also keeps beer and poptarts and eats gluten meals when we dine out, which is as it should be!)\n\nSit down, have a conversation, and try to work out a middle ground here OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not because he can't have his own treats, but because I'm the one with the sweet tooth, my chocolate chip cookie recipe is fantastic, and flour particles get everywhere. You two need to work on your communication because everyone is allowed to have their own snacks and treats. My partner is allowed to have his ramen and random snack items I can't eat, just like I'm allowed to have pickles and cottage cheese that he finds disgusting.\n\nGenuinely curious about your sensitivity. You say you're so sensitive you were diagnosed as a baby and have never had a gluten cookie but also are perfectly fine with baking with gluten? Something isn't adding up. I'm a year younger than you and I still remember the year of pain after lunch because my doctor mistakenly thought my spelt bread was gluten free, the knowledge back then had tons of gaps. I'm fairly low on the sensitivity with accidental contamination and even I make other people's treats gluten free because I need to be able to do things like taste them and don't want every surface in my house potentially contaminated with gluten. If my partner wants to bring treats into work we sometimes save money by making them with gluten if the recipe uses oatmeal, pretzels, crackers, premade cookies etc, but if flour is involved we usually choose safety over saving a few bucks.", "Wild that you even have wheat flour in your home.\n\nYour entire kitchen is going to be contaminated. Aerated flour is terrific at going everywhere.", "INFO: What about the cross-contamination issue? Are there different sets of baking supplies? What about counter space?", "Info: so uh, do you regularly also make gluten free things in the equipment he was using to make the gluten-full stuff?

And that's as someone who does all the primary baking in my house. I think this is more nuanced than people are making it out to be.\n\nIs he entitled to make himself a snack that you can't eat? Yes. But batches of cookies typically aren't 1-person small and they fill the house with a fantastic smell. If my husband was celiac and I made cookies with wheat flour he'd be super bummed.\n\nI've tried to think of what I'd do in this situation and my solution would probably be to first make a batch with a non-wheat flour and then make a batch with wheat flour. That way we'd both get cookies and my partner wouldn't have to just smell my baking and watch me eat it knowing they weren't allowed to eat anything. Or at bare minimum pick up a wheat-free version from the grocery store.\n\nIt's more complicated but that's what you do when you share space and a relationship with someone.", "YTA.

Smelling those cookies baking, knowing you can't have any. Kinda cruel, really. My daughter and I are both celiac, and while hubby can have his regular bread and regular (store-bought) cookies, if he made an entire batch of cookies that I couldn't eat, I'd be rather upset. People who don't have food allergies tend to feel little compassion for those of us who do. Btw, be very careful baking with wheat flour. Cross contamination is real, and even breathing in the flour can make some celiacs quite ill.", "Yeah sorry but YTAH.
