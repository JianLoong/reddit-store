You say you're so sensitive you were diagnosed as a baby and have never had a gluten cookie but also are perfectly fine with baking with gluten? Something isn't adding up. I'm a year younger than you and I still remember the year of pain after lunch because my doctor mistakenly thought my spelt bread was gluten free, the knowledge back then had tons of gaps. I'm fairly low on the sensitivity with accidental contamination and even I make other people's treats gluten free because I need to be able to do things like taste them and don't want every surface in my house potentially contaminated with gluten.
