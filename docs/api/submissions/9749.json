She got the dog as a rescue, and told me she was having trouble with training her. She wasn't adapting to the new house, new owners, or other dogs. Along with this, it was just bad timing. Not having the money to take another dog in. I asked her if she'd consider getting rid of the dog, and she said yes. So, I brought her home.\n\nMari, the dog, has now been living in my house for the whole half year. She's been trained since. She's house trained, listens to commands, is great with kids, and strangers, and can be walked without a leash (I still use one of course). All things I could not have said about her months ago. I had a few friends over today, and the former owner was one of them. After seeing how well trained she was, she told me she was gonna take Mari home next week.\n\nNow, I never bought Mari. But, I took her in under the assumption she was my dog. After all, I was told she was my dog. That my friend didn't want her. To suddenly change your mind after I've spent all this time training her, treating her like family, buying her toys and such, genuinely hurt me. I denied, and told my friend she should've put the work in herself If she wanted a trained dog. \n\nMy friends are on her side. She was the original owner, and she wants her dog back. According to some of my friends, they were told I was offered 200 dollars for Mari, but never was. I love this dog. And considering I'm recently out of a relationship, I'd really rather not lose the closest thing I have to an emotional support animal. She's there when I get home from work, she sleeps at the foot of my bed, She's my best friend. And I refuse to part with her. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. So, I have a small update. 1) The dog is in my name. I have all my paperwork in order, she is chipped, she's not going anywhere. 2) I've spoken to police already. She didn't contact them, but I informed them of the situation mostly just to make sure I was in the clear. 3) Thank you all so much. The kind words, the advice, the kind dm's I'd received from other dog owners. They've all meant the world to me. It's been a rough time lately, even before all this, so all the positivity really brightened a dark moment.

Best wishes on keeping your dog, OP.", "NTA.  There\u2019s no guarantee she will do much better with the dog, trained or not.  GSDs need structure and she\u2019ll be wanting to give it away in less than a year when it\u2019s running the show again.", "NTA. As an owner of a German Shepherd, giving Mari back wouldn\u2019t go as well as your \u201cfriend\u201d thinks it would. German Shepherds notorious for being very loyal and usually are attached to one person. Giving her back would be hard on Mari. We also rescued our GSD and it took a lot of work in gaining their trust and training them.", "NTA. She has no right to the dog. All you need is proof the dog is yours and paying a vet bill suffices. Also if she did take legal matters you could demand all of the costs for the last five months food, housing, vet bills  etc! The dog is a logical f rhings it's not a couch. It forms relationships it's done that. It would be crazy to separate the dog from you bc you're as much emotional support for the dog as the dog is for you!!", "Glad you got the paperwork in order. Unless you worded it differently to her and didn't reflect that here, you didn't offer a temporary setup. Not to mention, even if you did give her back, you'd just end up with her again after your friend undoes all of the training. But yeah, NTA for not returning her. You asked for her. She said sure. The end.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d wasn\u2019t very clear on directions with the dog. Also she wasn\u2019t willing to put in the commitment of raising a dog. It\u2019s just like a kid. It\u2019s like thar phrase, all kids deserve parents, but not all parents deserve kids", "\u201cThanks for doing all the work. Now I want it back.\u201d  Nope. Best wishes on keeping your dog, OP.", "Mari is yours. The \u201cfriend\u201d who wants the dog back is entitled and not a good dog owner. She is no qualified to have a dog. She also isn\u2019t your friend and neither are the people trying to pressure you to give Mari to that asshole. NTA", "NTA\n\nCurious though. Did the friend acknowledge that she was GIVING the dog to you or did she claim that it was just temporary while she got back on her feet.     Do you have any proof either way?\n\nThe only reasons your friends would take her side I assume is because they think you were just basically dog sitting, but now wont give her back", "NTA, dear lord, no way does that so-called friend get that dog back. That dog is yours, and you are hers. \ud83e\udde1", "NTA!!", "NTA please let people know in your circle about this and post pictures of you with your dog. You don\u2019t know if she will try and steal the dog and social media will help prove it. Just in case you need to show people in a quick moment it\u2019s your dog", "NTA\n\nThat's your dog.\n\nEven if she DID take him back he wouldn't STAY trained. She would not continue with his training. Then she'd be foisting him off on you for another six months just to take back AGAIN\n\nYou are attached.\n\nDog is attached.\n\nDrop the \"friend\"", "NTA, oh HELL NO! She gave that dog up and if she hadn't it wouldn't be the same dog at all!", "NTA. Keep your dog. Not sure about your \u201cfriends\u201d", "Maybe your friends need to see that text", "Yeah, my cat doesn\u2019t want her very fancy and expensive food that specifically formulated for her carnivorous needs.\n\nShe only wants what *I\u2019M* eating\n\nFreaking little asshole.  I can\u2019t even pour a bowl of cereal in peace without her immediately appearing and trying to stick her face in it", "NTA. Find out what your friends were told because maybe she told them some outlandish lie to make her side of the story sound better. If they still take her side, cut them all off.", "NTA, it's your dog now. Offer her a bill for $10k for the 6 months of boarding and training. She'll fuck off.", "NTA. Sounds like she didn't want you to take the dog, she just wanted her trained for free. All your friends are AHs if they genuinely agree that she deserves the dog back after abandoning her because she was too lazy to deal with the issues of a rescue dog.", "Find new friends, they are definitely the A\u2019s. Nothing worse than someone that is too fkn lazy to train their dog, easier to just dump it on someone else.  \n\nYour dog is lucky to have you!", "Wow. Your \"friend\" is the worst kind of pet owner. Doesn't want to do the work, so boots the animal, then wants it back when it's well behaved and trained. She doesn't get to do that. She doesn't get to take an animal back after a year and a half, leaving you to foot the bill for all of it. Nor does she have a legal leg to stand on. No judge is going to give her that dog back after a year and a half. Mari is your dog. (love that name by the way).\n\nGlad you decided to stand your ground. I'd also cut contact with this person, as she is not the type of friend you want to have. No friend would take away your dog like that. NTA", "Fuck that NTA. You have more to that dog in six months than she ever did.", "NTA - Vet bills in your name? That dog is YOURS.  \n\n\nGlad reddit was here to inform you of that. (Sounds like this would be a great 'friend' to lose.  What a creep!   \n\n\nIt is utterly wrong to give a pet to someone and then ask for it to be given back if that wasn't the initial agreement.  (And if you do want a friend to put in the time training your badly behaved pet - you better also be willing to put in the time learning how you should have done it - and paying them).", "Ask your friend if she wants to foot the bill for 6 months worth of vet bills, training, and 24/7 dogsitting to get \"her\" dog back \ud83d\ude02 Quote her a few thousand dollars for your services. \n\n(Actually don't do this, but it's fun to imagine)"]}
