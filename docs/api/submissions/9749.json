She got the dog as a rescue, and told me she was having trouble with training her. She wasn't adapting to the new house, new owners, or other dogs. Along with this, it was just bad timing. Not having the money to take another dog in. I asked her if she'd consider getting rid of the dog, and she said yes. So, I brought her home.\n\nMari, the dog, has now been living in my house for the whole half year. She's been trained since. She's house trained, listens to commands, is great with kids, and strangers, and can be walked without a leash (I still use one of course). All things I could not have said about her months ago. I had a few friends over today, and the former owner was one of them. After seeing how well trained she was, she told me she was gonna take Mari home next week.\n\nNow, I never bought Mari. But, I took her in under the assumption she was my dog. After all, I was told she was my dog. That my friend didn't want her. To suddenly change your mind after I've spent all this time training her, treating her like family, buying her toys and such, genuinely hurt me. I denied, and told my friend she should've put the work in herself If she wanted a trained dog. \n\nMy friends are on her side. She was the original owner, and she wants her dog back. According to some of my friends, they were told I was offered 200 dollars for Mari, but never was. I love this dog. And considering I'm recently out of a relationship, I'd really rather not lose the closest thing I have to an emotional support animal. She's there when I get home from work, she sleeps at the foot of my bed, She's my best friend. And I refuse to part with her.

Not only is she intending to steal your dog from you, but the dog is now bonded to you, and would desperately want to go home - to you! \n\nWhat a nasty piece of work this \"friend\" is. And your friends are nasty too for supporting her. Is she hot or something? Rich? Famous? There is no logical reason for them to take her side, even if they're friends with her.
