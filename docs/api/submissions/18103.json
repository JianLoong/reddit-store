A lot has happened since I posted, so I thought I'd give you an update.\n\nAbout a week after my post, my fianc\u00e9's parents contacted us. They apologized for their behavior, and begged to meet my son. They said they were ready to leave the naming debacle behind and truly wanted to be involved in their grandson's life.\n\nWe were skeptical, but invited them over to meet the baby. The visit went well. They began coming over almost every day during the next three weeks. I noticed neither of them ever called my son by his name, but I didn't point it out. For the first time in months, things seemed good between my fianc\u00e9 and his parents.\n\nOne day, my fianc\u00e9 was helping my FIL with something at our place, so my MIL and I went to the park with my baby. Some time later, I had to go to the bathroom, so I left him in the stroller with her.\n\nWhen I got back, she was sitting on a park bench, chatting with a woman who was cooing over my son. I went over there and introduced myself as \"(son's name)'s mom\", and she said, \"I thought his name was Peter.\"\n\nI didn't say a word, and neither did my MIL. She followed me to the car and we went back to my apartment. On the way there, I texted my fianc\u00e9 about what had happened. The moment we got there, he kicked both his parents out of our place.\n\nHe'd read my texts and confronted his father. Thankfully, my FIL is a terrible liar, and confessed immediately. Apparently, both my in-laws ONLY call my son Peter. That includes whenever they're talking about him, every time they introduce him to someone else, and even baby-talking to him on the few occasions they were left alone with him. Neither of them are embarrassed by this, and they both think they're in the right.\n\nWe're heartbroken. Especially my fianc\u00e9. Not only because his parents can't let go of their pride, but also because the name we chose for our son means a lot to us both.\n\nI blame myself for encouraging my fianc\u00e9 to allow them near our son. I was raised in a different city than all my grandparents, and always wished they could have been more involved in my life. Losing my grandmother didn't help. Pretty much every doubt I had only existed because I thought it would be important for my son to grow up with all of his grandparents around.\n\nBut now, all my guilt is gone. If they can't respect my son enough to call him by his name, they don't deserve to be in his life.\n\nI hope they enjoyed the three weeks they had with their grandson. Because that's all they're getting until they get their heads out of their asses.", "created_utc": 1684973464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13r2g5t/update_aita_for_breaking_my_fianc\u00e9s_family/", "score": 3592, "replies": ["It\u2019s a sad situation and sorry about it OP.

It is understandable that you want to set and maintain boundaries with them when they have not shown your family respect and continue to put their needs above yours.", "Can think of a few good names for your fianc\u00e9's parents.", "Wow! Just.. wow. Sorry your in laws can\u2019t get over something so trivial, they\u2019re missing out on so much and that is on them.

Are they this psychotic and unhinged about other things in life or just this one issue?", "What a pity it turned out how it did, all over a little boy's name. When he grows older, I hope he doesnt feel any guilt for having no relationship with those grandparents because he was not named to their demands; it's his grandparents, after all, that chose to take action and not be in his life because of something they had no rights to try and control.\n\nWhat's in a name, as Shakespeare once wrote.", "Wow. This seriously sucks. I totally understand where they're coming from. I see your side as well. Ultimately its a parents decision what to name their kid and short of naming the kid something terrible like Adolf, your inlaws are either gonna have to decide if they can be grandparents to \"not-Peter\" or theyd prefer a life without him", "damn. they suck!", "They don't call him by his name because they think they are right which is very disturbing. Perhaps the three weeks was a gift that clarified their perspective, actions and intent. Continue to thrive.", "I'm so sorry - it's amazing how many people come on here with the same story ; I had a boyfriend 20+ years ago that had the same tradition in his family.

My MIL pretended not to remember my name every time she saw me, and my FIL would lose interest in any conversations that weren't about him. Once it was clear me and my fianc\u00e9 were in for long term, they started acting a lot more friendly towards me, but it never seemed sincere.", "The worst part is that we named our son almost two months before my grandmother passed, and they said they loved the name. I know they were lying now, and that after she died they didn't feel the need to keep it up anymore.", "As much as I wish this wasn't happening, I'm glad I caught my MIL in the act as soon as I did. I'm still not sure what they were trying to achieve by calling him Peter, but none of the ideas I've had about it are good.", "Richard Head?", "For one...", "My maternal grandparents did this to me. They didn\u2019t like the name my parents gave me, decided I should be named Amanda, and then called me Amanda for years. And no, there was no family tradition, my name is nothing close to Amanda, there wasn\u2019t anyone else in my family named Amanda. \n\nIt was super confusing when I was little - I\u2019d get told off for not coming when called or not listening when they told Amanda not to do something. When I learned to write my name for the first time, they told me I had spelled it wrong because my name was Amanda. \n\nAt least when I was little I just assumed they didn\u2019t know. I mean, I just learned to write the alphabet, maybe they\u2019re just learning too? Or maybe it was like how I called them Grandpa and Grandma, but they also had different names - maybe Amanda is like that? And then I got old enough to realize that no, they were just shitty. \n\nEventually I refused to see them unless they called me by my name. They never did. \n\nI was nice enough to remember their names but all I did with that info was search the obituaries every few years. \n\nAnyways, good for you. What a weird ass hill for them to die on.", "Wow! Turns out that they\u2019d rather have a make believe grandson named Peter than absolutely no grandson at all. Pretty despicable that a name is worth more to them than an actual human being. Good riddance forever!", "So sorry your in laws are terrible. Have you thought about adopting a pet and naming him Peter? That way people will wonder why they\u2019re so obsessed with your pet instead of talking about their grandson", "Good lord they sound insane. Have any of the other family members come around yet, or are they still on their side?", "That is absolutely insane.", "Sorry to hear about the grandparents not respecting your son, but MAD props to your husband for kicking them out and having your back. You definitely found a keeper OP. :)", "You're making the right choice, even though it's obviously a very difficult one.", "These people are weird as fuck!!!  My goodness", "This is just plain weird what the heck?? Weirdos man you name your son what you want not what these dictators want. WEIRDOS", "Honestly it's a pretty harmless way in the end for you to learn that they are absolutely banana pancakes crazy and should never be anywhere near you or your kids. It sucks but in the end I'd be really grateful to get out of a situation with that level of entitled psychosis relatively unscathed. What a shit show, hope everything is easy going from here on.", "I\u2019m sorry it has come to this for you and your fianc\u00e9. I always look at the naming of children like so: If you\u2019re not involved in the making of the child, you\u2019re not entitled to much of a say in the naming of it either!", "I'm very proud of you and your fianc\u00e9. You're a united front and with Inlaws like that, it's very much needed.\n\nAlso NTA", "I gotta say, Peter is better than Throwawaybaby.\n\nJust kidding. Hope they get their heads out of their asses for baby's sake.", "Their lack of respect is astounding, especially after they crawled back and assured you that they put the naming debacle behind them. \n\nYou should have told the woman in the park, \"No, his name is not Peter, it is \"Alec\". You will have to excuse my MIL. She gets confused.\" \n\nAt least your baby is young enough that he won't be confused at being called by the wrong name.", "op=NTA\n\nBut I'm so sad for you.  Clearly you did not want to \"deprive\" them of their grandchild.  Even tho it is THEIR behavior which is causing it.", "I am sorry, OP. That was very disrespectful for his parents to do that to you three. I agree with you, it's time to set up the boundaries. This is your child, not their child. They don't get to dictate everything for your baby. Sending lots of virtual hugs to you and your fiance as you two move forward.", "You are completely in the right, but beyond that should have no regrets.\n\nNo doubt it is nice for children to have regular contact with thoughtful, caring grandparents, but apparently that was *never* an option with your in-laws. And many many kids have infrequent or no contact with their grandparents (emigration, distance, retirement, death, etc) and they nonetheless grow up perfectly fine.", "Good for you, OP.  This *is* a hill to die on, never doubt it.", "I'm still struck on, \"they only agreed.\" They don't get to choose the name. You never agreed, and even if you did, you and DH could always change your mind.  Some kids don't seem to fit the name the parents have chosen once they popped out.", "Christ. What is with these people? Get a fucking GRIP. \nI\u2019m sorry OP. But it seems like your baby will at least have fiercely protective and loyal parents.", "Yea I think you should probably go no contact indefinitely. Sounds like their judgment is seriously off.", "Honestly this gives off weird cult like vibes to me", "this is amazingly bonkers unhinged shit omg", "I\u2019m sorry your in-laws are assholes. If they really want to make a baby Peter so bad, maybe they should adopt a baby and do so. There are plenty of kids who would love a home.", "I'm so sorry OP. I'm sure, though, that you're being great parents to your little one. Having loving, caring parents is far more important than having your grandparents in your life.", "Question, am I allowed to be honest or only agree? \n\nEither way hope emotions die down and baby can enjoy life.", "It's absolutely crazy but when I read about them being fine with it, I just KNEW they were calling him Peter. The fact that these rubes let this \"tradition\" go on for 7 generations is mind boggling. How is that any kind of noteworthy thing? Were their lives so mundane that they thought this would elevate them to a high society level for their family in the future? \n\nI hate that people just cannot make up their own minds in the year 2023. Everything is dictated by our past, whether it's traditions, religions, or even our own damn names. A name is supposed to make us DIFFER from everyone else. A name is meant to give us individuality and a clean slate from any bad things that those before us did. It's meant to cleanse all children of the whole \"sins of the father\" bullshit. \n\nI am so glad you found this out now before they could do any lasting damage to your son. I am so glad your husband wasn't brainwashed by this garbage and has his own brain. You did well in finding him and I wish you both, and your son, nothing but peace and happiness.", "If they don\u2019t even respect the name you gave your child, I\u2019ll tell you what, they will be a nightmare about literally every other decision you make. \u201cOh you don\u2019t let the toddler drink cola?

I'm sorry you went through that, but thank you for sharing.", "Genuinely that would be hilarious 10/10 absolutely recommend. Also because pets with names normally associated with people are hilarious.", "It sounds like these people have always been ugly.", "Most of my fianc\u00e9's cousins have come around, and his brother was always on our side. His grandmother and some of his aunts and uncles are with us too. His grandfather (divorced from his grandmother), two out of three living Peters (the two oldest) and pretty much everyone else are either still mad at us or haven't reached out to talk about it yet.\n\nMy entire family is on my side. They promised not to interfere in the naming process, but are relieved we didn't name him Peter.", "I'm almost certain I wouldn't have been able to put my foot down if my fianc\u00e9 wasn't okay with it.

It's the name of one of my best friends.", "Well one of the names starts with Pe at least.", "Peter File?", "ive had a similar issue. they kept calling me by the exs name, and also one of their siblings names because theyre similar. i can understand the sibling one because of how close the names are, but not the ex. it was clearly intentional, because once the distance went away, harassment started. every chance was taken to give me shit for something. \n\npro tip; if invasive in laws suddenly hang around A LOT more than usual, or ask heaps more questions, keep an eye out. theyre up to something. seems like unfortunately you ran into this too.\n\ni hope they do pull their heads out of their asses, because when it comes to a name, it wont be long before your kiddo can correct them himself. itd be great if he didnt have to do that of course, but imagine the embarrassment theyd have when he himself corrected them instead of you when the stranger was talking to MIL. so much more shame. it also unfortunately may look like he was kidnapped or not in safe hands if the person looking after him cant even get his name right.\n\nbest of luck with it all op. i hope the dust settles and everything is chill for all again soon", "my lady it sounds like they're too obsessed with sniffing each other's farts to be in you and you precious family's life. \n\n\nbest of luck flourishing thank gou for for updating \ud83d\udc90", "     MIL pretended not to remember my \n      name every time she saw me.\n\nSo that explains it!
