A lot has happened since I posted, so I thought I'd give you an update.\n\nAbout a week after my post, my fianc\u00e9's parents contacted us. They apologized for their behavior, and begged to meet my son. They said they were ready to leave the naming debacle behind and truly wanted to be involved in their grandson's life.\n\nWe were skeptical, but invited them over to meet the baby. The visit went well. They began coming over almost every day during the next three weeks. I noticed neither of them ever called my son by his name, but I didn't point it out. For the first time in months, things seemed good between my fianc\u00e9 and his parents.\n\nOne day, my fianc\u00e9 was helping my FIL with something at our place, so my MIL and I went to the park with my baby. Some time later, I had to go to the bathroom, so I left him in the stroller with her.\n\nWhen I got back, she was sitting on a park bench, chatting with a woman who was cooing over my son. I went over there and introduced myself as \"(son's name)'s mom\", and she said, \"I thought his name was Peter.\"\n\nI didn't say a word, and neither did my MIL. She followed me to the car and we went back to my apartment. On the way there, I texted my fianc\u00e9 about what had happened. The moment we got there, he kicked both his parents out of our place.\n\nHe'd read my texts and confronted his father. Thankfully, my FIL is a terrible liar, and confessed immediately. Apparently, both my in-laws ONLY call my son Peter. That includes whenever they're talking about him, every time they introduce him to someone else, and even baby-talking to him on the few occasions they were left alone with him. Neither of them are embarrassed by this, and they both think they're in the right.\n\nWe're heartbroken. Especially my fianc\u00e9. Not only because his parents can't let go of their pride, but also because the name we chose for our son means a lot to us both.\n\nI blame myself for encouraging my fianc\u00e9 to allow them near our son. I was raised in a different city than all my grandparents, and always wished they could have been more involved in my life. Losing my grandmother didn't help. Pretty much every doubt I had only existed because I thought it would be important for my son to grow up with all of his grandparents around.\n\nBut now, all my guilt is gone. If they can't respect my son enough to call him by his name, they don't deserve to be in his life.\n\nI hope they enjoyed the three weeks they had with their grandson. Because that's all they're getting until they get their heads out of their asses.", "created_utc": 1684973464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13r2g5t/update_aita_for_breaking_my_fianc\u00e9s_family/", "score": 177, "replies": ["It\u2019s a sad situation and sorry about it OP. You gave them a chance and they threw it away like chumps, and then you and your husband communicated and made an adult decision on something so difficult together. You two should be proud. I hope your grandson grows up proud of his parents and his name.", "I am so sorry to hear this. How disrespectful. It is understandable that you want to set and maintain boundaries with them when they have not shown your family respect and continue to put their needs above yours.", "Can think of a few good names for your fianc\u00e9's parents.", "Wow! Just.. wow. Sorry your in laws can\u2019t get over something so trivial, they\u2019re missing out on so much and that is on them. I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 is with you on this. \n\nHope you and your fianc\u00e9 are enjoying this time with your son, I miss mine being little peanuts!", "Yikes. Are they this psychotic and unhinged about other things in life or just this one issue?", "What a pity it turned out how it did, all over a little boy's name. When he grows older, I hope he doesnt feel any guilt for having no relationship with those grandparents because he was not named to their demands; it's his grandparents, after all, that chose to take action and not be in his life because of something they had no rights to try and control.\n\nWhat's in a name, as Shakespeare once wrote.", "Wow. This seriously sucks. I totally understand where they're coming from. I see your side as well. Ultimately its a parents decision what to name their kid and short of naming the kid something terrible like Adolf, your inlaws are either gonna have to decide if they can be grandparents to \"not-Peter\" or theyd prefer a life without him", "damn. they suck!", "They don't call him by his name because they think they are right which is very disturbing. Perhaps the three weeks was a gift that clarified their perspective, actions and intent. Continue to thrive.", "I'm so sorry - it's amazing how many people come on here with the same story ; I had a boyfriend 20+ years ago that had the same tradition in his family. If we had stayed together, it was going to stop. My BIL's ex MIL actually filled out his daughter's birth certificate with the same SHE wanted her to have.", "\n\n>Because that's all they're getting until they get their heads out of their asses.\n\nSo you will never have to see them again. They will never change. They will never be sorry(except sorry excuses for humans). Don't every let them into you lives again. Having Grandparents can be vastly overrated", "This is heartbreaking here. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I'm just glad that this was figured out now before your son started getting confused about what his name really was.", "It is truly sad to me how such a happy thing like a beautiful child can turn people so ugly", "We can be grateful you found this out now, because if you play your cards right, by the time they see your son again, he'll **know** his name because no one will refer to him as \"Peter.\"", "...and none of them remotely sound like Peter.", "According to my fianc\u00e9, they've always been a little entitled, but I never really saw them enough to be able to say that. \n\nI will say that, though they were polite, they very clearly didn't care about me until we moved in together. My MIL pretended not to remember my name every time she saw me, and my FIL would lose interest in any conversations that weren't about him. Once it was clear me and my fianc\u00e9 were in for long term, they started acting a lot more friendly towards me, but it never seemed sincere.", "The worst part is that we named our son almost two months before my grandmother passed, and they said they loved the name. I know they were lying now, and that after she died they didn't feel the need to keep it up anymore.", "As much as I wish this wasn't happening, I'm glad I caught my MIL in the act as soon as I did. I'm still not sure what they were trying to achieve by calling him Peter, but none of the ideas I've had about it are good.", "Richard Head?", "For one..."]}
