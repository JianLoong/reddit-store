Professional nanny here \ud83e\udd2aI\u2019ve had instances where my mom and or boyfriend was my ride from work and never did either of them come to the door. Once I had my mom drop me off lunch and I asked permission before and literally all she did was meet me at the door with lunch. NTA but in the future you should lay out very clear guidelines of what you expect/ what\u2019s an absolute no!", "NTA. You don't know her mom. You hired Gabby to do a job as an adult. If she worked at Pizza Hut, mommy would not be allowed behind the counter in the employees-only area. This is the equivalent of what she did bringing her mother into your home (and you're right, mom had no reason to go inside your home). If she were a teenager, MAYBE I might feel differently, but Gabby is a grown woman.\n\nUltimately, tell your co-worker that as Gabby's employer you set a boundary, and she basically shrugged, said it was a stupid boundary, did not apologize for crossing it or promise not to do it again. As such, you lost trust in her (which is kind of necessary when that person is watching \\*your children\\*), and she was let go. Tell her you don't owe her stepsister a job, and she is now free to find an employer that is more in line with her style and work ethic.", "NTA\n\nAs a professional nanny and long time babysitter, you don't let strangers in the house without permission unless it's an emergency. Even then you at least send a text.", "NTA, maybe I watch too much dateline but I wouldn\u2019t trust a babysitter who didn\u2019t understand that it is not appropriate to bring someone into your house. Mom or not, she is 21 not 16 she should know better. \n\nIm surprised all the YTA, are you all really that non worried about who you leave your kids with? \n\nIf gabby wanted to keep her job she should have taken OP\u2019s concern seriously apologized and said it won\u2019t happen again. Do not keep a babysitter that brushes you off when you raise an issue. Childcare is not the business to let red flags slide, because the children will be the ones to suffer.", "Gonna go against the flow here. NTA. \n\nI don't understand why people are so willing and ready to accept someone they don't know into their homes with the babysitter and their kids. \n\nI do not care if it's the babysitters mothers, she can call, text, knock on the door and talk there and NOT GO INSIDE. \nIt's very sketchy that this woman felt the need to go inside a stranger's home so easily the way she did. She or the sitter didn't ask or bring up the visit to you beforehand. \n\nThere was absolutely no need for this random stranger to go inside your house. It's the same as someone visiting you suddenly telling their friend that they can visit too. \n\nAnd sure, the babysitter knew her mother, yeah. YOU DO NOT. IT IS /YOUR/ HOME. IT IS /YOUR/ CHILD. \nand for the sitter? It's her JOB. \nI'm positive you'll find a more practiced sitter in place of her. One that does not invite random strange men or women into your home and has the common sense to at LEAST contact you in case they have a family/friend coming to give them a ride home. \nYou are well within your right to protect your kid the way you choose to, especially in this matter. \n\nI would apologize for coming across as harsh, but that's just me personally. I would not take this person back as a sitter. They've already shown you they are irresponsible to handle that role by allowing strangers YOU don't know into YOUR home with YOUR kid.", "NTA. I can't believe people are saying YTA. it doesn't matter the age , who she let in, how much time the person was in the house, and it also doesn't matter that she wasn't apologetic. \n\nif i hire someone for a job at my house, i don't expect that person to have other people in my house, and i don't need to explain that to the person, because the house is mine.", "NTA. Gabby was unprofessional. Your reaction is understandable.", "NTA \nGabby's mother is unknown and could literally be a danger to the children. Was she? Probably not, but that wasn't Gabby's call. Her doubling down on it not being a big deal instead of apologizing shows that she isn't trustworthy and would willingly disregard your rules in your home. Not babysitter material.", "NTA\n\nHer job was to take care of your children and for that you have to trust her with your children and home. She broke that trust by inviting her mother without checking it by you first. Her mother is most probably just any other normal person and not a treat to your children. But she does not get to decide that and her not understanding that shows lack of judgement. It is not strange for you to lose your trust in her.\n\nI work in a preschool and I had to among other things prove that I do not have a criminal record and I had to sign a confidentiality agreement before starting. That is whats needed to be entrusted to work with children and handle private information about them. It is taken very seriously by all employers in my country. It would be unthinkable, not to mention unprofessional for me to invite my mother or any other person to my workplace, especially if I was expected to be alone with the children.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird how people justify the babysitter\u2019s action because it was her mom, not a \u201crandom person.\u201d Well, it is a random person to OP. I don\u2019t care who that is to the babysitter. OP does not know her and has never met her before. Also, the most important problem here is that the babysitter did not give prior notice, nor did she acknowledge the issue afterwards. Why not just shoot a text \u201chey my mom is picking me up is it ok that she uses the bathroom real quick\u201d? Why not just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry she needed to use the bathroom real quick, I\u2019ll make sure next time this happens I\u2019ll let you know\u201d? This is so weird.", "From the sounds of this situation, Gabby is more than unapologetic. She's quite dismissive and has an attitude of \"I can make my own rules\".  Not someone I would want around my children or home.\n\nThis young woman should be old enough to know the unwritten rules of not allowing strangers (to the owners) into the house.", "NTA - why did she need to come in for 15mins 30mins before you were supposed to be home to pick her up?\n\nI babysat as a teen, and rule number one was not letting anyone into the house. I just find it incredibly odd that the mom, whom you do not know at all, needed to enter your home.", "I babysit occasionally as well and would NEVER let anyone into a client's home, unless it was an emergency - especially someone whom we are not all familiar with. Her being Gabby's mother is honestly irrelevant, she's a STRANGER to you and hadn't gotten your permission to enter. All the Y-T-A's should can it, it ain't their house getting trespassed. What was she doing inside for 15 minutes anyway?? **NTA**", "NTA. Just because she\u2019s your sitter doesn\u2019t mean she has the right to let someone YOU don\u2019t know in your house. She\u2019s 21 and should know better. OP like you said she should have at least texted you.", "I\u2019m assuming that Gabby doesn\u2019t have a lot of professional experience. This is a tough but important learning lesson in her future career endeavors. If it was an office or store, she would have thought twice before allowing family or otherwise into the workspace.\n\nIf she\u2019s willing to let mom over, who\u2019s to say she won\u2019t let her friends or romantic partners enter? It\u2019s a clear boundary. Good on you for prioritizing your children\u2019s interest over your coworker\u2019s feelings.\n\nEdit: forgot to add NTA.", "You didn\u2019t give permission for anyone else to enter the house; while the babysitter is an honest worker, the mom could be casing the house for someone to come later to commit a crime for all that we know.  NTA", "NTA. Yeah, it might've not been a big deal in this situation, but it is a matter of principle: strangers you don't know and weren't made aware of absolutely should not be let in the house without your knowledge and consent. If she needed to talk to her mother, why not naking a ohone call or stepping outside for a minute?", "Weird, I don't have kids and not a huge maternal instruct but this would bother me. If Gabby was younger my answer would probably be different but she's 21 and there's no legitimate reason for her mom to be in the house. She can wait in the car. \n\nNTA", "ESH - this feels like a 0 to 100 real quick. She definitely should have let you know, text or called and said her mom would be there. I agree there\u2019s really no reason for her mother to have had to be in your house. But maybe there are things we don\u2019t know, reasons for it. \nAnd when confronted she should have apologized. \n\nI feel like you could have said \u201cdon\u2019t do this, or ask our permission, even it\u2019s it\u2019s your mother. This is our house after all\u201d. To jump immediately to termination seems like a hell of a leap. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s your house, but as I said\u2026.that\u2019s a hell of a leap.\n\nEdit: I say she should have talked to her more because OP said Gabby didn\u2019t SEEM apologetic. That \u201cseem\u201d to me implies that she simply didn\u2019t perceive the apology as that - IF it was given at all. We have no idea how that conversation actually went (I haven\u2019t gone through comments to see any OP responses, so I am most likely missing some things that aren\u2019t in the post). \n\nOf course OP has the right to do what they deem best for the family, and Gabby is definitely (in my belief) the bigger if the AH, but I stand by my judgement as well. This whole thing sounds like it could have been handled better", "NTA would she even have told you if you didn\u2019t catch it on camera?", "NTA. After confronting her and her response being \"not a big deal,\" I would have fired her as well. She's an adult and should understand that letting someone other than the homeowner's family into the house while babysitting is unacceptable. She could have easily texted and said that her mom needed a ride home and was going to swing by and wait in the car; that's no big deal. The lack of comms from an adult, coupled with the nonchalant response, I likely would have done the same.", "The fact that she wasn\u2019t even apologetic here is alarming. NTA", "NTA. There was no reason for her to let someone into the house. If she had texted before hand or shown remorse after the fact then I\u2019d think you went to far but neither of those things happened. It should just be common decency to notify the owner of a house if unplanned people are going to be going inside.\n\nETA removed \u201cunpopular opinion\u201d", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why so many people are ok with a stranger entering your home without permission. I would fire her too simply because of her judgment.", "NTA\u2026but I get why people are saying otherwise\u2026probably could have been handled better", "INFO: did you ever make it clear that no one else was allowed in for any reason no matter who they were? Because it sounds like you fired her for violating an unwritten rule that she didn\u2019t have a chance to correct.", "NTA. She said it wasn\u2019t a big deal when you said it was? Didn\u2019t apologize? You were right to fire her. She needs to learn to take her work seriously and set better boundaries with her mom.", "NTA. The babysitter shouldn't be letting anyone in the home that hasn't been vetted or approved by the children's parents. It's not her property to do what she will. And the fact that she was dismissive of the mother when she brought it up? She would probably do it again.\n\nNTA NTA NTA.", "Wow, it's so interesting to see how split the answers are! I think that shows that there's isn't a universal rule about what is or isn't allowed, unless the ground rules are stated up front. I had a friend who was babysitting and the mother told her at the end of the night that she was upset to see that she hadn't put away the clean dishes that were in the dishwasher. Dishes that my friend hadn't used. Obviously, the mother thought that she was hiring a babysitter/housekeeper, whereas my friend thought she was just babysitting. It's all about expectations!\n\nI can totally see why Gabby didn't think it was a big deal--it was her mother, and she was only there for a short while. But, I can also see why it would be alarming knowing that a stranger was in your home with your kids. Personally, though, I think YTA. Once you found out it was her mother who was giving her a ride home, I would think that you'd agree that it wasn't a big deal, so I do think firing her was an overreaction. Better to then just tell her that you were uncomfortable with that, and in the future if something like this happens, to please ask/give you a head's up first.", "Why is everybody saying Y T A????  She\u2019s not some family friends teenager you let watch your kids and casually hang around your home. This is a grown ass woman that is supposedly trying to start some sort of babysitting side hustle business? Not the way to go about it. \n\nI have so many issues with this, starting with the fact that she\u2019s 21 years old and her mother is driving her around to babysit. What if there was an emergency? She would be left sitting there waiting for someone to come grab her and the children. Also the fact that she didn\u2019t even warn you that someone else was coming into your home? I would be more understanding if this was a teenager, clearly heavily dependent on their parents, or even if she had just communicated beforehand that she relies on her mom so much. On top of that tho, you literally talked to her about it and tried explaining how it wasn\u2019t okay and she didn\u2019t try to understand and then argued with you over what was okay by her standards in YOUR home. \n\n\nYou have certain expectations in a babysitter, and she made it clear she has zero plans to meet them because doesn\u2019t agree with you. People saying firing her was extreme are the same people who would ask why you kept her employed if you didn\u2019t fire her and she did this stuff again. NTA NTA NTA !!!!!", "NTA. It\u2019s not the fact that she brought her mother in specifically, it\u2019s the fact that common sense says do not invite unknown adults into not your home while babysitting without letting the parents know. The issue is communication. She could have easily said that she was getting a ride from her mother and ask if her mother can wait for her inside. No parent wants to be blindsided by an adult they don\u2019t recognize in the home with their children.", "NTA- she should have check with you prior. 15 minutes is all it takes for something bad to happen. My old school friend had a neighbor babysit, babysitter let her sister in and the sister was there for like 20 minutes and ended up partially blinding a 3 year old.\n\nThink about it- would you be okay with a stranger around your child? What if this was a grown man in your house without your knowledge with your child? Is it because she is a women she\u2019s not a danger? Would you be okay if you hired a paid service in your household and they let someone into your home who is not providing a service without your permission? What the hell is wrong in the head of those saying YTA?\n\n\n\nThis is a place of business. At your place of work do you allow relatives and friends into your private workers only areas?", "N T A\u2026.Gabby\u2019s attitude was very flippant. It doesn\u2019t matter that it was just her Mother. She should\u2019ve said oh I wasn\u2019t thinking and it won\u2019t happen again. Gabby should\u2019ve let the parents know hey my Mom is coming to pick me up. Can she come in the house to wait? \n\nThe ones that are saying YTA, I understand their point. But I also think Gabby\u2019s attitude sealed her fate.", "NTA \n\nGabby did not seem to be understand why you wouldn't want a stranger in the house. If her mom was no big deal, is her best friend also no big deal? Her boyfriend? Her second cousin's third husband?\n\nIf Gabby had understood the concern, learned the lesson and apologized then I wouldn't have fired her. \n\nSince Gabby did not seem to care one way or another about the parent's wishes regarding strangers in the house - she shouldn't be hired again as a babysitter.", "NTA and I don\u2019t think you fired her for letting her mom in. You fired her for not understanding that it was a problem after you explained that and why it was unacceptable.", "NTA \n\nIf Gabby had acknowledged she made a mistake and agreed not to do it again, then it would\u2019ve been fine. Lesson learned. But she argued and denied it was an issue, so OP was right. Not sure why anyone would attribute this to a \u2018superiority complex\u2019", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your home is your home and you have every right to feel how you do. This babysitter isn\u2019t a child. You don\u2019t know the mom. Essentially, your hired help let someone into your home and they were there for a much longer time then they needed to be. If she had asked permission prior my answer may be different. \n\nGabby was wrong, but so was the mother. Who just goes into their daughter\u2019s pace of business and hangs out for 15 minutes? That kind of entitlement is why Gabby doesn\u2019t see an issue. My parents would never just drop by my work, regardless, and then hang out. The times that they did, I ran it past my manager first and they met my team. Gabby and her mom are wrong. You\u2019re not an asshole. Your coworker sucks, too. Happy holidays.", "NTA... I think your response would have been different if she had apologized and said that she wouldnt do that again. It was her lack of understanding that this was a violation of your trust and privacy that alarmed you.", "NTA - I think the bigger issue aside from her mother coming over in itself, is her not understanding why it was not okay, or at minimum why she should ultimately respect your wishes. I think things would have ended differently if she had apologized and understood where she went wrong. But doubling down and arguing was definitely the wrong move and would be a red flag to me for future problems coming up.", "NTA. A lot of people saying YTA make it sound like you and your husband fired her on the spot without any warning and overreacted. But, they failed to imagine the conversation leading up to that. You confronted her about letting another adult in the house you did not know, without your permission, and she argued back and brushed it off. That\u2019s not ok behavior. Period. And anyways, it\u2019s not your job to be lenient on a FULL GROWN ADULT WITH A FULL GROWN FRONTAL LOBE you just met, it\u2019s your job to get a babysitter you trust with your kids.", "NTA, totally. Who cares if it's her mom, her long lost twin or the milkman? You do not know this person. You did not allow this person into your home. You were not even warned about this! It is perfectly normal to be concerned that a stranger comes in and hangs around your kids without warning. Gabby had taken liberties with your property and more importantly with the safety of your children. A babysitter does not get to decide who should or should not be allowed inside your house in your absence. And given her reaction, there would have been a repeat performance.", "Very much NTA and this is part of the reason why I am so against babysitters for my kids that are not family and family that I wholeheartedly trust. You just never know what the intentions of someone is. I would be very upset and fire her, too, if she let anyone unauthorized into my home. It is SO EASY to shoot a text asking, \u201chey is it okay for my mom to drop by a minute?\u201d.", "NTA. If she had apologized it would be Y T A, but seeing as she did not understand the problem then she is in the wrong here. \n\nIt\u2019s your house so it\u2019s your rules, and honestly I wouldn\u2019t appreciate a random woman entering my house if it were me. She should have respected your wishes despite it being her mom. Perhaps if she had asked beforehand it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, but seeing that on the camera would send me off. \n\nAnd I agree with you; why the hell did the mom even come into the house?

You also don\u2019t know her mom and I don\u2019t see a reason why her mom would need to go inside if it\u2019s not an emergency.

She did not need to come inside. Gabby needed to your permission before letting in another person. Her mom could have been an abusive mother. That also could have not been her mother.

It could have been discussed and if not it's common sitter knowledge? With all the kidnappings and injuries that happened to children I would be furious about ANYONE entering my home. I don't care if it's my own mother dropping by. No one is entering my house without my prior approval. Point blank. \n\nThere's also the fact she blew off the concerns which show red flags of doing it again. Who would risk that with their children. 1st it's the mother, then it's the partner then it's friends. \n\nShe's not a kid she's an adult that should know not to invite a stranger to the family into the house. Note I said stranger to the FAMILY. The family doesn't know the mother so that is beyond weird. \n\nI nannied for several years and I would always ask before someone dropped by. Me and my grandma would swap cars a lot (she preferred my car going to the doctor as it was easier to park IE smaller) so I would always alert the family when she would drop by to swap cars (they were totally fine with it since I TOLD them) and it got to the point the kids I nannied considered my grandma their grandma.

Second time was I had a kid throw up all over me so I called a friend and asked her to bring me some clothes and stay for 10 minutes so I could quickly rinse all the puke off me and change. Both times, I called as well as texted the parents and let them know verbally/written what was going on and who the person was (known to the parents both times), what they were doing there and how long they were there for.

For others, the trust just doesn't extend that far.\n\nMy job involves a great deal of caregiving staff and we have stuff like HIPAA and state regulation on top of basic safety to worry about. But a basic--and reasonable--rule of thumb is that unless you are a person authorized by a patient, that patient's guardian/POA, or a third party authorized by the facility, you don't get to come inside. You don't get to step into their home.\n\nCare staff doing one on one in-home are are subject to similar rules. Your boyfriend, mom, friend, etc don't get to come inside. They can say whatever they need to say at the front door or over the phone on your break, and wait outside. This is for the safety and privacy of the people paying for care, because they are vulnerable. So are your children.

No idea where the father was but he was almost never around. In the almost year I babysat I never met him. But she needed a break from this demon, so she offered me like $200 for the night and I could invite a friend over. My cousin came with me, and after that night she made sure I never went back lol he refused to go to bed, I did the usual thing of letting him stay up and watch a movie before trying to get him back to bed, and that didn't work. He ended up playing just dance with us for a while to burn off some energy, but around 1am we really started pushing for him to just go to bed, and hoo boy he did not like that. He barricaded himself in his mother's room and went on a rampage. He broke almost everything in there, ripped the curtains off the wall, put a hole in the ensuite door, etc etc. We spent probably close to 2 hours trying to get him to come out, until his mom came home. I guess her guilt at leaving us with her demon child was too much and she came home early. She finally managed to get him to open the door, proceeded to scream at him for probably half an hour and sent him to bed.

Thankfully I was old enough to get an actual job (not saying babysitting isn't a real job but you know what I mean) and I never did have to go back there.

I just don't think she's being rude like so many other commenters seem to interpret, and I can a whole lot more easily see where the babysitter is coming from than the OP. \n\nI babysat all through high school.  This was in the 80s where having a penis wasn't an automatic disqualifier for babysitting, so a different era.  Most of the time it was a similar situation where you kinds/sorta knew someone from work, or through my parentcs' friends or something.  Every single new client set up ground rules/boundaries before leaving - some would relax them as they knew you better.  Some people didn't want a TV on (distraction to me - screen time wasn't a thing), some no time on the phone, some let friends over to study, especially if it was a weekday at the last minute.  I dated a girl for three years in high school, same deal, and I got to know the neighbor around the corner and I was allowed to come over, if the babysitting was all night I was expected to leave by 1 am, etc, and I continued babysitting for her after my gf went to college.   So, the initial ambiguity is totally on the OP - this isn't a professional she is hiring.  OP says it is a side hustle, which could mean anything from actively advertising certifications and paying for college with the money to occasionally saying yes to friends of friends to buy some weed for the weekend.  And if this is a fire-able offense, OP definitely needs to point that out.\n\nMy son is almost 18, so about the babysitters age.  We only needed a baby sitter like twice, and it was terrible to find one.  No wonder with all the vitriol below.  Boys - automatic disqualifier, maybe get reported to the police just for being open to trying it.  Girls - I don't see/hear of any pre-college aged girls doing it, many require CPR and First Aid and infant CPR and multiple references and now they are supposed to be omniscient and know exactly what the OP wanted.\n\nAnd, I mention my son's age mostly because it puts me at a certain place in time.  Everyone seems so aghast that the 21 year old babysitter can't read minds.  Her mom and ride home stopped by.  Who knows what happened in the house?  I know the country was cold and then it got intense in the last week or so, maybe she just needed to warm up.  And if the mom was about my age, it wouldn't have been a big deal, that's just how things were.  So, blaming a 21 year old for not seeing the problem, but not blaming the OP for laying out rules for what is expected seems dubious.  Worse, I read it as a short conversation.  I can totally see someone that doesn't do this all the time, that maybe only does it for people she knows, really not understanding what the problem is.  I barely do - we are safer now than at any point in the baby sitter's life (and the baby sitter's mother's life), yet we make up problems about how someone is lurking around the corner everywhere.\n\nI read the OP, and to me she sounds like she is quite entitled and yells at cashiers and service industry workers for things out of their control and is just treating the babysitter the same way.  She says she saw the video feed at 1:30 and was alarmed, but didn't do anything until she got home.  How alarmed could she have been?  She's got time to be looking at video feeds, but not to call the babysitter?  She didn't ask \"did your crack dealer make a stop at the house?  Oh, it is your mother?  Well, I'd still prefer nobody I don't know come in, I'm sure you understand\".  But no, she waited until she got home and expected a 21 year old to immediately understand her made-up fears and prostrate herself enough to be granted another chance.  I get that the OP is taking money for a service and the OPs boundaries take precedence.  But it seems like the conversation was short, and if the babysitter didn't understand the problem immediately on the spot, it is kind of hard to apologize as hard as OP apparently wants.  Just as likely - given it is December - once the OP pulled into the driveway, the babysitter was thinking about getting ready for a holiday thing or getting paid and getting a few gifts, planning to say some niceties and be on her way and was blindsided by OP about something she never imagined was a problem.\n\nJust a final thing - I agree with some of the NTA people about if you've lost trust in the babysitter, you move on and find someone else.  But, this seems to be an expectation thing that is easily moved past, and OP did indicate the babysitter saved her by being available on short notice.   And doesn't report any other issues except this one time her mom stopped to pick her up early.  Again, if she'd called when she saw the video and was \"alarmed\", rather than surprising her with rules that weren't discussed beforehand, things could easily have played out differently.  Sounds like OP is entitled and didn't get her ass kissed sufficiently in an immediate fashion, and hopefully karma comes back next time she needs someone on short notice.

It's not like we are Jean Gray or Professor X. We can't read minds. You can't overstep a boundary you didn't know existed. She doesn't have kids, so unless someone informs her they aren't comfortable with it, how would she know? In her eyes, it's her mother who wouldn't do anything to harm the children. Maybe she had to use the bathroom because she was on her period and leaking threw her pants and needed a pad or tampon? If mom doesn't like it and isn't trusting, then get nanny cams.", "Statistically speaking the grand majority of people who are likely to harm your children are ppl you/they know. Aka the babysitter is a bigger threat than the babysitter's mom or even a family member... that's all imma say. ( Although ur rule im not arguing against your rule)", "Ok but you're aware she worked with her sister and the other sister was her nanny.. Not a complete stranger.", ">and stressed it was something she wouldn't do again\n\nWe don't know that she didn't say she won't do it again. She likely said \"I don't see what the big deal is but okay it won't happen again. It's just my mom lol\". But obviously the story is convoluted leaning toward OP's perspective.\n\nOP overreacted. \n\nThe babysitter didn't let a \"stranger in the house\". The babysitter let her mother in the house. \n\nIf the babysitter literally let a random hobo into the house that no one knew personally, then yes that would be grounds for immediate dismissal. The mom is not a stranger.", "That's ridiculous.", "Could\u2019ve been a shit.", "I guess I should be mad? I hired a Rover walker and when the Ring camera told me someone was there I just checked in like always. She had brought a friend who went on the walk with her. They didn't hang out in the house but they did come in to put the dogs on their leashes. Never occurred to me to care. Maybe I should have.", "YES a complete stranger. That's the definition of never meeting someone. Just because she's someone's mother doesn't mean she's automatically safe. I know people whose parents are addicts, or felons, or fill in the blank. \n\nIt's really beside the point though. OP asked her not to do it again. Gabby said, \"eh that's a dumb rule.\" OP didn't feel like her wishes were being respected, so that's why she let her go.", "Yeah- weird. I know someone who had a friend who had a beach house and their son was visiting. \n\nThey thought it was totally appropriate to have us visit to pick up their son and meet the owner of the home. \n\nThe owner \u201cfriend\u201d was cordial, but that someone was completely oblivious that this was a faux paux. They didn\u2019t ask ahead either. I thought they had done so before we got there and I felt uncomfortable as I felt like I was invading this owner\u2019s space once I realized that communication was never done. I was apologetic- but the someone still wasn\u2019t aware of their mistake. I felt that this someone was taking advantage of the situation and getting too comfortable. \n\nYou don\u2019t just invite people to someone\u2019s house without asking first. Etiquette 101. I was taught that when I was a kid. It\u2019s just polite and respectful to always ask and respect \u201chouse rules\u201d which are boundaries, especially when taking care of someone\u2019s children.", "Hahahaha my application for Best Buy is exactly where I pulled that from. That was my first summer job well over a decade ago.\n\nMy step mom actually found [my old name badge](https://i.imgur.com/C8rLgmH.jpg) like last week.", "LOL! I need to get this for my fianc\u00e9e! She\u2019s marrying a Midwesterner. \ud83d\ude02"]}
