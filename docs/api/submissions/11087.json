{"id": 11087, "submission_id": "11dokdr", "title": "WIBTA for not building a ramp to our house for disabled nephew?", "selftext": "My wife and I recently bought a new house. After we closed on the house my sister came to see it and asked when we would like her husband to install a ramp. The ramp is for her son, who is in a wheelchair. He and other niece's and nephew used to come over to our old house all the time to hangout with our kids. My sister husband, who works in construction, previously installed a ramp in our old house as well as my brothers house because he and my sister want their son to feel welcome in everyone's' home.\n\nOur previous house was very standard and installing a ramp was easy. This new house however sits up high which means it needs a very long ramp. After measuring according to specifications we've realized that we cannot install a ramp unless we get rid of some of our homes features. \n\nOur front yard is a tiered garden. It is my wife's favorite feature as she is an avid gardener. We probably would not have bought this house if not for the garden as we had our eye on another. If we built a ramp leading to the front door it would cover the majority of the tiered garden. \n\nThe only other option is the side door (we do not have a back door). The side door however leads directly into the driveway that goes up alongside the house to the garage in the back. If we built a ramp in this area it would make the driveway too narrow for many of our vehicles. We have very limited parking on our street so we would basically lose half our driveway parking. I also wouldn't be able to get my old muscle car in the garage where I had planned on storing it.\n\nI've explained this to my sister and she is unhappy about our reasonings. Especially the one for the front door. She says she gets the parking problem, but the garden is just a cosmetic thing and not worth making her son feel unwanted or like a second thought.\n\nOther family is also unhappy because now our house is unusable for family parties since nephew won't be able to come. We do family parties on a rotating system between me and my brother since we're the only ones with big enough homes. I said we could do the family parties out in the back yard in the summer. It's big and has a lot of trees and a large canopy area where we can put some nice outside furniture and barbecue. The garage also has a bathroom that is accessible, so it shouldn't be a problem for nephew to come so long as everyone hangs out outside. They think it's unreasonable because it will be too hot to stay outside the whole time and people will need air conditioning. If they go inside to cool down nephew will feel left out. My brother also doesn't like that the burden is now on him to always host. Especially since he will always have to host for thanksgiving and Christmas which are the most hectic holidays.", "created_utc": 1677536029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dokdr/wibta_for_not_building_a_ramp_to_our_house_for/", "score": 860, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After we closed on the house my sister came to see it and asked when we would like her husband to install a ramp. The ramp is for her son, who is in a wheelchair. He and other niece's and nephew used to come over to our old house all the time to hangout with our kids. My sister husband, who works in construction, previously installed a ramp in our old house as well as my brothers house because he and my sister want their son to feel welcome in everyone's' home.\n\nOur previous house was very standard and installing a ramp was easy. This new house however sits up high which means it needs a very long ramp. After measuring according to specifications we've realized that we cannot install a ramp unless we get rid of some of our homes features. \n\nOur front yard is a tiered garden. It is my wife's favorite feature as she is an avid gardener. We probably would not have bought this house if not for the garden as we had our eye on another. If we built a ramp leading to the front door it would cover the majority of the tiered garden. \n\nThe only other option is the side door (we do not have a back door). The side door however leads directly into the driveway that goes up alongside the house to the garage in the back. If we built a ramp in this area it would make the driveway too narrow for many of our vehicles. We have very limited parking on our street so we would basically lose half our driveway parking. I also wouldn't be able to get my old muscle car in the garage where I had planned on storing it.\n\nI've explained this to my sister and she is unhappy about our reasonings. Especially the one for the front door. She says she gets the parking problem, but the garden is just a cosmetic thing and not worth making her son feel unwanted or like a second thought.\n\nOther family is also unhappy because now our house is unusable for family parties since nephew won't be able to come. We do family parties on a rotating system between me and my brother since we're the only ones with big enough homes. I said we could do the family parties out in the back yard in the summer. It's big and has a lot of trees and a large canopy area where we can put some nice outside furniture and barbecue. The garage also has a bathroom that is accessible, so it shouldn't be a problem for nephew to come so long as everyone hangs out outside. They think it's unreasonable because it will be too hot to stay outside the whole time and people will need air conditioning. If they go inside to cool down nephew will feel left out. My brother also doesn't like that the burden is now on him to always host. Especially since he will always have to host for thanksgiving and Christmas which are the most hectic holidays.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It meant we lost one side of the garage for parking, but since she wasn\u2019t driving anymore, it didn\u2019t matter.

But they don't and they aren't.\n\nFrankly, I wouldn't have put a ramp on the first house simply because of the entitlement they're now facing. \"Congrats on your new house! Where does our nephew's ramp go?\" *Excuse me? Do you live here? Did I ask where it should go? Then butt out.* Would you ask me to rehome my cat because my nephew most unfortunately developed an allergy? No, that's ridiculous. The proper compromise is to go to my nephew rather than kicking the cat out so that I can continue to host him.\n\nMy family has two wheelchair-dependent members and while that makes gathering together difficult, it's far from impossible, but with my cousin we are able to makeshift a ramp for his chair. It's mechanical and heavier than he is to lift, so he and his chair enter the house as a unit. My grandmother's wheelchair was I guess what you'd call old school, she had to use the wheels or be pushed. My uncle would carry her across the threshold and my dad would be right behind with the chair. It had to be folded because of the narrow doorway. I suppose the nephew's specific reason for being in a wheelchair comes into play as to why he needs a ramp and cannot be navigated in without one, but if it's a possibility to help him enter the house sans ramp, his parents should be open to that.", "Why should op buy it?", "This post isn\u2019t about temporary ramps, it\u2019s about building a permanent one. \nOP has said that they could look into temporary ones - it\u2019s the sister and BIL who assumed that they would want one built in like their previous house.", "So a man that has clearly for years accommodated his disabled nephew and hosts 50% of all gatherings forever has now purchased his dream home but he should forego his favorite things about theplace he worked hard to buy because his sister has a child in a wheelchair?

That\u2019s ridiculous and unfair. why not solve this issue and host parties at his PARENT\u2019S house, as they have a disabled child?

A permanent ramp has to meet building codes for maximum slope but a temporary one that is only pulled out on occasion and always used with a couple of people helping could be much steeper.", "I was thinking of what if OP helped carry nephew into the house and then they brought the wheelchair in. I feel this would make the most sense as it's simply a convenient solution while it may not be the best solution. The only problem I could see would be the kind of wheelchair, however perhaps if the wheelchair is too heavy to lift(which only some are) they could just sit the nephew down inside and leave the wheelchair in the vehicle.", "Exactly. My daughter goes to speech therapy at a place that also does physical and occupational therapy. The office is in a older shooping plaza. Short sidewalks and high doorways. They have a metal, few foot long ramp they bring out for kids in wheelchairs. Parents and the therapist assist the child and they put the ramp away. Takes like 2 mins. \n\nNo one is inconvenienced.

I think your sister and BIL are crossing a line by demanding that all family homes are wheelchair accessible, at any cost. It\u2019s not like you built the home from scratch and made it inaccessible on purpose. \n\nI think there are plenty of compromises to ensure your nephew is included in family events that don\u2019t involve permanently altering your home or reducing its value. For example, a temporary ramp (which your BIL should source and provide, since he\u2019s an expert), or offering to \u201chost\u201d at another venue that is wheelchair accessible - such as an Airbnb or other local rental option.

Not everywhere, unfortunately, is easy for a handicapped person to access, but that doesn\u2019t mean they just never enter those places", "No i am not. If you want a genuine accessibility option your going to need something like a ramp or a lift. \nAlso even it was hypothetically possible to carry the nephew and chair (very very unlikely and also something many wheelchair users are not comfortable with) at this moment please tell me how ageing relatives will carry him when he\u2019s a full grown adult\u2026", "About as rare as someone who provides supporting evidence (like the cost of the climbing chair) and doesn't just start throwing insults lmao", "That's kind of funny. Like a used car in a way. \n\nBTW since you would probably know what's the maintenance like for these kinds of things? Considering it would be outside.", "62 inches", "He does not allow people to help him. It's an independence thing.\n\nWell this is a judgment sub, not an advice sub. So I was really just looking for a general consensus before talking to my sister again. You're more than welcome to give advice though if you want.", "Yeah, some else suggest that. I'm going to look into it.", "He does not allow people to carry him.", "They likely did max out at that in the early days of them, and humans are bad at wanting to accept that the world/time moves forwards.", "I hope you get a ramp to suit your needs : ) it is so hard trying to accommodate a mobility disability that even the little things like a proper ramp make a world of difference.", "Tell me why ur choosing to argue w me on a post we don\u2019t have all the information on & im just more so wondering then telling???", "I already love ya", "Is there any way he could make a turning ramp? One that makes a u or an s to the ground that maybe faces towards the back or side yard and then add a sidewalk to it?", "having a lift available to roll out onto the driveway when he comes over should be ok, temporary loss of parking while he is visiting isn't horrible.", "Also, is there perhaps a sort of movable ramp for the side door? Something you could store in the garage?", "Hopping on this to say *please* have someone look at your situation who is actually trained on disability accommodations before building anything, for your nephew's safety and whoever may be helping him. \n\nFrom what you're describing, a portable ramp sounds way too short. The ramp will be too steep for him to safely navigate, even in a power chair if he uses one. I used to manage people who did these home modification assessments and usually, if the rise was more than about 40\", we would recommend the vertical platform lift. The ramp would just be so long and usually involve switchbacks. VPLs aren't cheap though, and many require a reinforced concrete pad beneath them. Please please please have a professional involved. I've seen the grisly aftermath of lifts that weren't properly installed or the right size or weight. Oh, and you'll need to make sure the landing zone for the lift at both the top and bottom of the rise is large enough, especially if he will need to turn to get into the doorway. \n\nThe alternative is just never having your nephew to your home again. Which is shitty for him, your kids, and your whole family. You knew about his accessibility needs and that he's in your home frequently when you chose your home. You definitely chose the gardens over being able to have him come over. Some houses are not accessible and require a bunch of work to become accessible, and you bought one knowing full well you have a disabled family member who frequently spends time in your home. (And he's young too, not like your 99 year old great grandma who may not need it longer. This will be an issue for decades.)", "Thanks for clarifying that. That is tough. Good luck OP.", "I dont mean to come across as harsh or ableist, but this may be a situation where nephew has to compromise and learn to let people carry him or his chair up stairs.\n\nIf its just going to be for holidays, and just at your house, he may need to swallow his pride for those moments.", "Have a nice day buddy", "Hun you don\u2019t need all the information to understand a wheelchair and stairs do not go together", "It would have to to be a turning ramp. That's part of the problem and why it would stick out so much.", "I think its rly important that you know that carrying someone in their wheelchair is super dangerous and carrying them without it can also be dangerous and or painful depending on the disability. That's without it going into the fact that plenty disabled people find it absolutely humiliating to be carried either way."]}
