{"id": 11087, "submission_id": "11dokdr", "title": "WIBTA for not building a ramp to our house for disabled nephew?", "selftext": "My wife and I recently bought a new house. After we closed on the house my sister came to see it and asked when we would like her husband to install a ramp. The ramp is for her son, who is in a wheelchair. He and other niece's and nephew used to come over to our old house all the time to hangout with our kids. My sister husband, who works in construction, previously installed a ramp in our old house as well as my brothers house because he and my sister want their son to feel welcome in everyone's' home.\n\nOur previous house was very standard and installing a ramp was easy. This new house however sits up high which means it needs a very long ramp. After measuring according to specifications we've realized that we cannot install a ramp unless we get rid of some of our homes features. \n\nOur front yard is a tiered garden. It is my wife's favorite feature as she is an avid gardener. We probably would not have bought this house if not for the garden as we had our eye on another. If we built a ramp leading to the front door it would cover the majority of the tiered garden. \n\nThe only other option is the side door (we do not have a back door). The side door however leads directly into the driveway that goes up alongside the house to the garage in the back. If we built a ramp in this area it would make the driveway too narrow for many of our vehicles. We have very limited parking on our street so we would basically lose half our driveway parking. I also wouldn't be able to get my old muscle car in the garage where I had planned on storing it.\n\nI've explained this to my sister and she is unhappy about our reasonings. Especially the one for the front door. She says she gets the parking problem, but the garden is just a cosmetic thing and not worth making her son feel unwanted or like a second thought.\n\nOther family is also unhappy because now our house is unusable for family parties since nephew won't be able to come. We do family parties on a rotating system between me and my brother since we're the only ones with big enough homes. I said we could do the family parties out in the back yard in the summer. It's big and has a lot of trees and a large canopy area where we can put some nice outside furniture and barbecue. The garage also has a bathroom that is accessible, so it shouldn't be a problem for nephew to come so long as everyone hangs out outside. They think it's unreasonable because it will be too hot to stay outside the whole time and people will need air conditioning. If they go inside to cool down nephew will feel left out. My brother also doesn't like that the burden is now on him to always host. Especially since he will always have to host for thanksgiving and Christmas which are the most hectic holidays.", "created_utc": 1677536029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dokdr/wibta_for_not_building_a_ramp_to_our_house_for/", "score": 6310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After we closed on the house my sister came to see it and asked when we would like her husband to install a ramp. The ramp is for her son, who is in a wheelchair. He and other niece's and nephew used to come over to our old house all the time to hangout with our kids. My sister husband, who works in construction, previously installed a ramp in our old house as well as my brothers house because he and my sister want their son to feel welcome in everyone's' home.\n\nOur previous house was very standard and installing a ramp was easy. This new house however sits up high which means it needs a very long ramp. After measuring according to specifications we've realized that we cannot install a ramp unless we get rid of some of our homes features. \n\nOur front yard is a tiered garden. It is my wife's favorite feature as she is an avid gardener. We probably would not have bought this house if not for the garden as we had our eye on another. If we built a ramp leading to the front door it would cover the majority of the tiered garden. \n\nThe only other option is the side door (we do not have a back door). The side door however leads directly into the driveway that goes up alongside the house to the garage in the back. If we built a ramp in this area it would make the driveway too narrow for many of our vehicles. We have very limited parking on our street so we would basically lose half our driveway parking. I also wouldn't be able to get my old muscle car in the garage where I had planned on storing it.\n\nI've explained this to my sister and she is unhappy about our reasonings. Especially the one for the front door. She says she gets the parking problem, but the garden is just a cosmetic thing and not worth making her son feel unwanted or like a second thought.\n\nOther family is also unhappy because now our house is unusable for family parties since nephew won't be able to come. We do family parties on a rotating system between me and my brother since we're the only ones with big enough homes. I said we could do the family parties out in the back yard in the summer. It's big and has a lot of trees and a large canopy area where we can put some nice outside furniture and barbecue. The garage also has a bathroom that is accessible, so it shouldn't be a problem for nephew to come so long as everyone hangs out outside. They think it's unreasonable because it will be too hot to stay outside the whole time and people will need air conditioning. If they go inside to cool down nephew will feel left out. My brother also doesn't like that the burden is now on him to always host. Especially since he will always have to host for thanksgiving and Christmas which are the most hectic holidays.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It meant we lost one side of the garage for parking, but since she wasn\u2019t driving anymore, it didn\u2019t matter.

But they don't and they aren't.\n\nFrankly, I wouldn't have put a ramp on the first house simply because of the entitlement they're now facing. \"Congrats on your new house! Where does our nephew's ramp go?\" *Excuse me? Do you live here? Did I ask where it should go? Then butt out.* Would you ask me to rehome my cat because my nephew most unfortunately developed an allergy? No, that's ridiculous. The proper compromise is to go to my nephew rather than kicking the cat out so that I can continue to host him.\n\nMy family has two wheelchair-dependent members and while that makes gathering together difficult, it's far from impossible, but with my cousin we are able to makeshift a ramp for his chair. It's mechanical and heavier than he is to lift, so he and his chair enter the house as a unit. My grandmother's wheelchair was I guess what you'd call old school, she had to use the wheels or be pushed. My uncle would carry her across the threshold and my dad would be right behind with the chair. It had to be folded because of the narrow doorway. I suppose the nephew's specific reason for being in a wheelchair comes into play as to why he needs a ramp and cannot be navigated in without one, but if it's a possibility to help him enter the house sans ramp, his parents should be open to that.", "Why should op buy it?", "This post isn\u2019t about temporary ramps, it\u2019s about building a permanent one. \nOP has said that they could look into temporary ones - it\u2019s the sister and BIL who assumed that they would want one built in like their previous house.", "So a man that has clearly for years accommodated his disabled nephew and hosts 50% of all gatherings forever has now purchased his dream home but he should forego his favorite things about theplace he worked hard to buy because his sister has a child in a wheelchair?

That\u2019s ridiculous and unfair. why not solve this issue and host parties at his PARENT\u2019S house, as they have a disabled child?

I feel this would make the most sense as it's simply a convenient solution while it may not be the best solution.

My daughter goes to speech therapy at a place that also does physical and occupational therapy. The office is in a older shopping plaza. Short sidewalks and high doorways. They have a metal, few foot long ramp they bring out for kids in wheelchairs. Parents and the therapist assist the child and they put the ramp away. Takes like 2 mins. \n\nNo one is inconvenienced.
