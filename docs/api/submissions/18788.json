I\u2019m pretty sure she knows her friend with the kid has sex.\n\nOR \n\nDo you mean her friend making noise? Because that\u2019s not a bad thing either. It is common when something is very pleasurable. If not one has made a noise with you, it\u2019s something you should look into.", "NAH.\n\nAdults have sex. Literally nothing wrong or shameful about that at all. But does it bother you to hear them? Does it keep you awake? If it does, and you'd like them to be quieter, I think it's completely fine to discreetly say something. Whoever you are closest to of the two of them. No need to involve your girlfriend. \"Hey, just an FYI, but I am up pretty late at night and the walls are rather thin here.\" No judgment needed.\n\nIf it doesn't actually bother you or keep you up, then leave it alone. Use headphones and listen to music or a podcast so you aren't just awake hearing it. And no reason to say anything, NOR any reason to feel guilty about not saying anything.", "I want to clarify a few things before I read comments about them \n- I\u2019m not ashamed that my friends are having sex me and my gf do it too and she makes noise as well.\n- what I mean by I don\u2019t want my gf to think badly of her bestie doing it I didn\u2019t mean her having sex I meant like thinking in the sense that her best friend didn\u2019t consider us being there or something like that\n- I\u2019m not uncomfortable about them having sex I just don\u2019t know if I should bring it up in a conversation just to let them be aware that I have heard them\n(Honestly I guess I should\u2019ve rephrased my question of AITA for not telling them that I have heard them and just keeping to myself about it)", "You're all grown ups...just mention in passing if they could keep their bedroom activities a bit quieter.\n\nYou would be the AH if you were laying there, jerking off to them having sex, and allowing them to continue to do so for your benefit.", "Don't stay the night there anymore if you're that bothered by the noises.", "YTA \n\nWhy would gf think badly if her friend for having sex? Do you think badly of them for having sex? Seems like they are trying to keep it quiet (tv on and stuff). Why does knowing that they have sex make you feel awkward? Very weird\u2026", "NTA.  Not that there's anything wrong with a couple of consenting adults having sex.", "YTA - not for not saying anything but for thinking there's anything to say.  Why does this make it awkward? Her friend has a kid for fuck's sake - how do you think that happened? If you can't handle what people do in the comfort and privacy of their own home, while taking steps to not bother guests - don't fucking stay there.", "NTA - But you could tell them in funny ways, like make a musical playlist, or even suggest some classic sci-fi movies for them to watch, like...\"Screamers\" ;P Or go the opposite direction and tell them they might want to get an exorcist because you keep hearing this strange moaning at night...telling them outright would be awkward, humor might make it a bit easier and take the edge off.", "NTA\n\nClearly you\u2019re capable of what many aren\u2019t, your are minding your own business.\n\nMight I suggest some earbuds or similar for you so you can continue minding your business", "NTA. \n\nThe only person you're possibly an AH to is yourself, depending on whether it bothers you to have to hear it. \n\n...Okay, I mean, if you loooooove to hear it, that's a whole other thing, but it doesn't seem like that's the case. Do you think anyone would worry that you were enjoying it too much?", "NTA. \n\nYou being uncomfortable is 100% valid. It\u2019s awkward to have to sit there and listen to that. If it\u2019s really affecting you, you should definitely bring it up. But you\u2019re not an asshole for not. It might be uncomfortable to approach that, but your friends also should try and be a little more self aware that there are people staying with them and that there\u2019s a possibility y\u2019all can hear everything. Not everyone\u2019s gonna LOVE to hear that. I know if my man and I had friends staying over, I\u2019d be very on edge/anxious about having sex knowing they could potentially hear us.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They can then do with that knowledge what they want. Allow them to be private about it.", "I'm completely getting the point. Your girlfriend doesn't even hear them having sex. They try to cover it up with the tv. If your girlfriend has to babysit, then you can drop her off and then pick her up the next morning. Your present is not required for babysitting overnight. You're making something out of nothing. Have you ever heard of ear plugs or noise canceling earbuds?", "Another person said to turn it into a joke which I really like that idea and it goes with what you\u2019re saying which is to tell them in a more upbeat manner instead of a serious talk. And then let them decide what to do about it."]}
