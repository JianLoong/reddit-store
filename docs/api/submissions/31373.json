Now Lindsey (15)  has it rough being middle child and she looks different from her siblings. I truly was confused how she had blond curly hair while the rest of the family has dark hair. I though genetics was being weird and I love her.\n\nThe issue came up when Lindsey told me her parents banned her from getting an ancestry test. I told my son and DIL that there was something fishy around her birth she needs to know. They denied it and told me to leave it alone. Now Lindsey is in high-school and she went to her biology teacher. To put it bluntly the teacher said it was odd for her to have some traits.\n\nShe came to me distressed asking me to buy an DNA test since she needs to know. Long story short she is not her mothers kid.  My son got someone else pregnant and her bio mom gave her up.\n\nThis has blown up the family while Lindsey is pissed to being lied to, I am getting a ton of heat for getting her a DNA test. Now they won\u2019t talk to me which is making Lindsey even more mad at them.\n\nEdit: because I have answered this multiple times. They were on the other side of the country when she was born and I met Lindsey when she was about 6 months old. Really not hard to hide the whole thing\n\nEdit2: I am confused why a lot of Redditors are treating this like she is 5 and not 15. All I did was buy it she did all the paperwork and shipped it.

He's angry that he got caught lying to his kid and to his parent.", "I'm going with NTA simply because you were asked to buy the test for her. You didn't go out to be snoopy - she asked. Her parents were keeping a secret they were ok with, but clearly, she wasn't.", "NTA, her parents were causing her distress with their secret keeping and hamfisted method of trying to stop her from 'finding out' about the secret that basically involved telling her straight to her face that there was something about her ancestry they didn't want her to know so she isn't allowed to get DNA tests. You aren't to blame for their poor handling of the situation that put the girl in distress and made her come running to you hoping to find the answers to the questions they stupidly made sure to tell her she should be asking. They had every opportunity to handle this in a mature and sensible way but decided that would be too hard and awkward to deal with and stuck their heads in the sand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously, the very instant they banned her from getting that test the jig was basically up and the only question was 'what exactly are they hiding from me' so far as the girl they were lying to was concerned.", "NTA\n\nI had a parallel experience. \n\nI look nothing like my siblings so I got my sister and I to take a DNA test.

Like you didn't put yourself in their business, she did, and you advocated on her behalf. \n\nIF there's anything you omitted about how much Lindsey influenced this event, you got a reckoning coming.

That should be the end of that problem we can continue lying to her about it. No way is she gonna get around that banning no siree\"\n\nThat was a stupid move on their part.

They shut down any conversation, refusing to listen to her.\n\nI assume they did so to protect your son from his cheating. They did it to protect their image. However, this did this at the expense of their daughter. That is why they are the ah.\n\nYou did overstep. You did go against your granddaughter\u2019s parents, but you did so because of your granddaughter. I can't call you the Ah for that but I am not sure I would call you Right.\n\nNTA (as I can't blame you for doing as your Granddaughter wanted.

They are fighting the wrong battle.", "While I normally don't like going behind the parents' backs, I think I'll go with NTA.  This all stems from the father's actions and his unwillingness to accept the consequences of those actions.  15 is old enough for a kid to not be lied to about stuff like this.  Besides, you've now established yourself as the only family member that Lindsey can trust.  That's probably going to be an important role for the next few years.", "The minute they realized she was interested in a DNA test they should have been honest with her.

The thing is, the research is VERY clear here: not knowing your own origin story is detrimental to a person. \n\nEveryone who is donor conceived or adopted,  who was lied to, normally hates their parents or has issues. Obviously there are exceptions to every rule, but still. \n\nWill be doing a round of IVF with donor eggs soon and have put a lot of thought into this issue.

Especially during the holidays. All you need is an email address. The child WAS going to do it eventually. At least this way she had an adult to know and hopefully guide the experience.\n\nOP will be the calm in the storm for this child as a beacon of truth and trust. \n\nI get that the idea behind adoption and donor conceived people decades ago was different and parents did what was the best advice back then.

It\u2019s crucial for me to figure out now where I come from so I can live the rest of my life in truth and know this information.

It\u2019s also tough to mention that on top of the fact that the child will clearly realize she was accidentally conceived through her father\u2019s misdeeds. \n\nThe most interesting part of this, for me, is if your son\u2019s significant other, unless secret adoption papers were also done, has nearly zero rights to dictate what YOUR biological granddaughter does or doesn\u2019t do.

My brother in law was confused when like 20 people contacted him on 23 and me asking if he was their dad.

On top of that, I have to get at least one mammogram and an MRI every year to check for breast cancer and often I have to get a second mammo because they find something that turns out to be nothing.
