If you leave any kind of opening, a mouse and an opportunist will squeeze through it.", "NTA You are amazing for helping take care of your neighbor\u2019s kids a few times, but you\u2019ve got your own kids to take care of too.", "NTA.  She\u2019s using you and you do need to put an end to it for your own sake.", "A one time favor is one thing. An unpaid job is another. \n\nNTA", "Even if she paid you, paid for the kids food, and asked - you\u2019re still not the AH for not wanting to babysit someone else\u2019s kids. You don\u2019t owe her an explanation \u201cI won\u2019t be able to baby sit anymore\u201d if she presses and asks why \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable getting into that, it\u2019s a personal matter and I really can\u2019t discuss it any further.\u201d Politely and firmly and without being drawn into defending your position.", "NTA\n\nI hate this so much. Why can't you be nice to someone without them deciding to abuse that kindness?", "NTA and keep ghosting her. She did worse to you, she just started bringing them over without asking. \n\nIf she shows up again, turn her away, without a second hesitation. She knows exactly what she is doing and she is taking advantage of you because you let her get away with it. She thinks you are a doormat she can do this to.", "NTA\n\nStop.  You aren't staying home to be anyone else's free babysitter.  And you risk making your illness worse if you keep babysitting.", "NTA, but you need to say something.   I would tell her that you didn't mind it the one time, but due to your chronic pain condition you are not up to babysitting.   You don't work because your body is not up to it either, and your own household and child is as much as you can manage.  Tell her good luck in finding help.  You can't be taken advantage of if you don't allow it.  Stand up for yourself.", "What do you feel you owe her that you can\u2019t tell her no?", "NTA. Perhaps you can charge her something? (Although that could cause her go get entitled to your time)", "If the kids destroy my property and don't respect my rules in my house then it's done. The end. No other discussion needed. \n\nAs for justifying why? There is no why. I don't owe a justification to not do something I'm not obligated to do in the first place. You gotta justify to me why I owe you to to do something. \n\nGhosting is just fine. You owe her nothing. You don't owe any discussion for her to push back because she has no basis to push from.", "NTA. She only cares about how taking advantage of you benefits her. People shouldn't walk over you in general, but someone who just piles extra work on you so that they can take it easy/go through the day without a care definetly should be stopped. Do not feel bad for prioritzing yourself, and expecially not when she isn't offering any help, thanks or offers to return the favour.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd please for the love of your sanity stop worrying if you\u2019re being rude.  When someone comes over and destroys your house and uses all your resources they\u2019re not guests they\u2019re a cloud of locusts.  Spray a huge can of Raid on them and resume living in peace.", ">They've ripped the insulation off my back door, they've broken my kids' things, they are always messing with stuff I tell them not to..\n\nIf you can't handle it, have your husband answer and tell her no and tell her you're doing her a favor not asking for money to replace the damage the kids have already caused. NTA.", "I\u2019d lose my shit. But then again, I\u2019m not a fan of kids. Ghost her, or whatever, she doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you for just suddenly deciding that you\u2019re her full time, free babysitter.", "I told her as soon as it happened. She didn't really even acknowledge it. \ud83d\ude15", "Thats absolutely ridiculous and you need to put your foot down anxiety or not. \"I'm sorry but I can no longer watch your children as I was never asked, they destroy my property and you are not providing their meals and I can not continue to feed extra people. You need to find other arrangements.\" Full stop done, don't entertain any push back or excuses on her part.", "That's totally fine if you want to do that, but also, tread lightly. Your neighbour seems like 'give and inch, take a mile' type of person. Once a week agreement could turn into twice then thrice. You also said the kids break things so you may be losing effort and money even watching them once a week. It just seems like a tricky situation that could go sideways quickly.", "You sound super nice OP but you can still be nice and have firm boundaries. I am worried you're going to talk yourself into a position where you agree to something you're not happy with just to keep the peace. If you don't want to look after her kids at all, that's fine. Neighbours generally aren't babysitters unless there is a reciprocal arrangement. \n\nSetting boundaries so everyone knows where they stand is what nice people do. \n\nHere's what I recommend saying. \n\n\"Hey, it seems like our wires have gotten crossed here. I thought I was doing a one-time favour watching your kids, not agreeing to watch them all summer. I'm not able to look after your kids on any kind of regular basis. Please make other arrangements moving forward.\" \n\nYou need to keep it simple and polite and not give any wiggle room. Don't give any reasons they can refute or work around. Don't give any \"just in emergencies.\" They have already shown that if they have their foot in the door, they will take advantage. \n\nIf they come back with buts and excuses just say, \"that's okay, it was a misunderstanding. No hard feelings. Now we're both on the same page.\" \n\nIf they try to contact you to watch their kids as a once off or until they find another babysitter. \n\n\"Hey, as I explained I am not able to care for your kids. Please make other arrangements.\" \n\nIf they flip out, know that they're the ones who aren't being nice, not you. Even if you had a reciprocal arrangement, you have every right to say that something doesn't work for you. (And let's be honest, there is very little they can give that would balance childcare for 2 kids.)", "I didn't expect them to actually agree once OP starts throwing rates out. This is more a ploy to let her know OP is not going to be doing this any more. A lot of neighbor's arguments will be nullified once this is presented as strictly a business transaction.", "Ask her to watch your kids sometime. Just tell her no. NTA", "Not only that, but there are 3 adults in that home all working different hours? Someone should surely be home to watch the kids, and it seems like they shouldn't be that bad off financially.", "No she\u2019s not.  JFC. It\u2019s called babysitting. That\u2019s not raising someone\u2019s kids. But you are right. It\u2019s not her job to be a babysitter.", "It is not a shitty thing to do, given what she did to you. But yeah, you will probably have to do more than that for other reasons.", "Seriously. I work in sales and the single hardest objection to deal with besides someone not picking up their phone is someone giving short, one word shut down responses that tell me nothing about why they don't want to talk with me", "It sounds like you think you\u2019re talking to a computer rather than a person OP has to live next to. Eliciting compassion will facilitate a positive relationship, particularly since OP said she\u2019d actually be happy to help once a week when the entitlement from the neighbor is reduced.\n\nSomething tells me nobody would enjoy being your neighbor, no matter how \u201cright\u201d you are.", "You're really projecting hard here. There is nothing mean or rude about saying you are not available to do unpaid labor for someone. Even a neighbor. If they no longer wanna be your friend because you won't provide free labor, GOOD. It has nothing to do with how honest a person is, and everything to do with **not leaving it open to future debate.**\n\n*Oh, you're not available over the summer? See you in September, when I'll expect you to take my kids to school with yours! You haven't been feeling well? Well, I saw you at the movies, so you must be better!*\n\nExcuses are temporary and flexible. Statements are not. And these are whole adults here, not kids trying to make their grandma feel better about an ugly sweater. You're arguing with yourself, Man.  Enjoy it. :)", "Nta..it's not a dick.move to.say no.", "You have chronic pain, kids of your own and aren't really any better off financially than she is. Babysitting once in awhile is fine but she seems to assume she has found herself free child care for the summer. NOPE. NTA", "Nta, clearly, but if you're up for it, ask for payment.   Like $30 per day (or partial day) per kid.  It's still cheaper than daycare for them, and will relievesome of your financial stress.  But obviously if you're not interested just \"I'm sorry, I can't today\", and repeat as necessary.   Use an appointment as an excuse, and if they ask for details, \"I'd rather not talk about it\".

It's not even about you having to come with activities to entertain how many kids?  \n\nIt's not even about, well, you're not actually legally in charge of them so what happens if one of them, say, cracks his head open and you have to run to the hospital--you're not legally allowed to consent to medical treatment as you're not in loco parentis in any legal way. Not to mention that they'd rush to sue the pants off you, no doubt. \n\nIt's about uncompensated labor.  Your time is worth something--you know it because you said yourself staying home was 'free childcare' for you and your husband--you're aware how much money your time is worth (more than the salary you gave up).  She thinks she gets that valuable time for free?  Nah.  \n\n  \nNTA.", "NTA, make a list of everything the damaged/broken and hand it to her with a bill for replacement. Ask her you expect a check by the end of the week. You won't hear from her the rest of the summer.", "NTA. You can't (physically) be her babysitter, your health won't allow. The sooner you tell her the easier it will be, though someone that entitled won't make it easy. Take a deep breath and say no. You'll feel better, the stress of this can't be good for your condition.\n\n(No it is not a dick move. The one making dick moves is her and her sister).", "Yep this! The first time call it a favor and be done with it. The second time she should\u2019ve been paid from then on out.", "\"And I just naturally assumed you would either reciprocate, give me a few dollars for watching them for an entire day or send a few snacks with them\"", "Just remember that you don't owe her an explanation. The \"I'm sorry, I can't.\" \"It's not possible for me to watch your kids\" etc. is all that's needed. You might say that you'll do it in an emergency, but that by emergency you mean someone's in the hospital, not that they just weren't able to find another sitter.", "But that opens you up to watching them in exchange for goldfish crackers.  Ask for real money.", "Them crackers better be REAL gold lol", "NTA. \"I know you trust me with the kids, but I am not able to keep them for you.\" \"I understand how difficult it is, I cannot take them.\" (Never give a day/timeline like \"today\" bc it gives hope of tomorrow being an option)\n\"We need to limit our kids together to mutually agreed playdates\"\n\nOr pull the state law thing if it applies. \"I am not a licensed child care home and am not able to keep the kids.\" \n\nJust send the text \"I was unable to hear the phone when you called.

Next time she asks simply say, no I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not working for our family, when she invariably asks what or why it isn\u2019t working, don\u2019t explain it just gives her an objection to overcome and there should be nothing to overcome", "I know about spoon theory.
