So, three adults in one house working full time. Meanwhile, my husband is the sole income in our household, because I have a couple health problems that cause chronic pain, so it's easier for our household if I stay at home with the kids, saving us the cost of childcare. \n\nThis neighbor asked me if I could watch her son and her nephew for a few hours one day a few weeks ago, to which I said sure, no problem. Then she asked again that same week, this time for longer, pretty much the entire day, which meant snack and lunch for an additional two children. Money has been tight this year, so, we make sure there is enough for the kids to eat well, but that's pretty much it for food in the house. I didn't mind feeding the extra kids just the once, though.\n\nBut this is where the problems have started. Suddenly, she was bringing her son and nephew to me every day. She never explicitly asked \"hey could you watch my kids for the summer.\" Nor has she offered to send snacks and lunch with them, or to maybe even throw five or ten bucks my way so I can buy the extra food for them.\n\nAnd she's started to call me late in the night, even calling at 9:30 last night while I was out at the city's fireworks with my kids and my husband. I ignored the call last night, and I didn't pick up when she called this morning. \n\nI feel guilty, but at the same time, I never agreed to this, and days like today are why. I'm sore, and I'm over-tired, and it's enough just to handle my own kids on flare-up days, let alone two extras who are VERY high energy, and destructive. They've ripped the insulation off my back door, they've broken my kids' things, they are always messing with stuff I tell them not to.. \n\nAITA for refusing to be a free babysitter?
