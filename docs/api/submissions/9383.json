I teach math and him physics and he has a physics degree. We work at different schools for the same school board.\n\nI had a field trip to go to recently and while I was at school in the morning, my sneakers broke with one of the soles starting to separate. My husband had not yet left so I told him to drop me some other shoes on the way to my school. He came in with my 5 inch stiletto boots!\n\nI was annoyed but took them anyway and we were about to leave so I put them on. It was a bit rough because the trip involved lots of walking and some of it on grass and mud, so I probably looked like an idiot but I pulled it off and did not have to go barefoot. I am used to wearing heels and if they were block heels or even thinner heels that were not stilettos it would probably be no problem for me.\n\nWhen I got back, I called him a dumbass for being a physics teacher and not realizing stilettos would sink in grass and mud. He knew I was going on the trip but I regularly wear heels including these boots to school and to run errands so he said he thought it would be fine. He is a bit upset with me as the comment about being a physics teacher and not knowing irked him.\n\nSo AITA for that.\n\nEDIT: I should clarify that I did say ti bring anything that would be fine for walking long outdoors and he assumed those as they were boots.\n\nBut  fair I should have been specific but I own many shoes so I do not  really have names for them .
