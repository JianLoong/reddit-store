He has two little girls, both 6 & 7 from a previous marriage. Every weekend I would sleep over and so I would leave my shampoo and conditioner there. Lately, I noticed that my shampoo has been running out really fast. For example, it's brand new and within 2-3 weeks. It's already halfway or less than halfway. The only people who are living with my bf are him, his two kids, his mother, and his half-brother. They have their bathroom so I know it isn't them who uses it. \n\nMy boyfriend has his own he uses, and the girls have theirs also. We bought a fresh new one for them and it ran out within the next week. We found out that they have been using theirs for bubble baths and when they run out, they would use mine. Now I don't mind them using it if it's for their hair, but my shampoos are expensive. They cost at least $20 per bottle. After that had happened on multiple occasions, I stop leaving it in the restroom and keep it hidden in the room. One day the kids were going to shower so they told my bf they didn't have any shampoos and my boyfriend asked if they can use mine. I said fine and put some in the travel size for them. I told my boyfriend he needs to go and buy them a new bottle and he should tell them to stop using it for bubble baths or buy a bubble bath one separately. Well when they finished my boyfriend went to use the restroom and turns out, they used all of it again for bubble baths only. They didn't wash their hair. \n\nThe next day, the same thing happened and my bf asked me again. I told him no, I'm not going to give them anymore. It's not my problem because you knew they were out and you were supposed to go buy them a new one. We got into an argument over it, so I told him to let them use his, but they didn't want to. They said it's a boy shampoo. I stood my ground and said no. He needs to teach them to stop doing that. Well, the argument led to them letting their mom know about it. She called my boyfriend and called me a greedy bitch. That they are just kids and it's just shampoo. I can always go buy some more. I then told my boyfriend, why don't she go buy it then? She's hardly in their life and they only see her every other weekend. My boyfriend didn't say anything but I can tell he agrees with her.", "created_utc": 1672971914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104i1q3/aita_for_not_sharing_shampoos_with_my_boyfriends/", "score": 683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Charge the dad $40 each time for new shampoo and conditioner and see how happy he is for his kids to waste it when its coming out of his pocket. NTA", "This. OP you're NTA and your bf is showing who he is. As a father, he should watch over his girl's bath, and should be supplying whatever products they need. It is obvious what he expects from you: to slowly become the new mum in charge, and to get the blame everytime you would want to put some boundaries. It doesn't smell good for you.", "I\u2019m on your side, I really am.\n\nBut I have to ask why all the adults in this situation are leaving these girls unattended with bubble bath, when they\u2019re clearly not mature enough yet to use it judiciously or actually clean themselves. \n\nDo you or your BF help them wash their hair? Has anyone *taught* them how to wash their hair?", "It's only insignificant if you have plenty of money.", "NTA but maybe you shouldn\u2019t spend the night? Not for the shampoo but for him not parenting his children & to not confuse his children? Blended families are hard and that involves stepparents; not gf/bf. \n\nLogically I have no idea why he isn\u2019t buying them kid shampoo and bubble bath.  If he had to replace your shampoo a few times, I think he would buy the kid shampoos!", "Hell no. Walk away from this OP. You don't even live together yet!!

Even actual bubble bath can cause UTIs sometimes.", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to provide for his own children and obviously needs to oversee bathtime.", "Esh. He needs to buy them soap and she seems like a deadbeat mom so who is she to say anything to you. That being said Why even leave the products there. It\u2019s not your home. Take it with you. You know they are going to use it. Instead of getting mad every weekend, just take them with you", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend needs to be properly supervising his kids and making sure they are properly bathing because they aren't even washing their hair. Biggest issue because he's going to need to address hygiene multiple times in their lives and needs to stay on top of things while they are young. Furthermore, shampoo is not bubble bath- if this is a big issue, get them some bubble bath. Seriously, they are using so much because shampoo isn't designed to create that many bubbles. A cheap bottle will last much longer and still cost less than 5 bucks. And probably make much better bubbles.\n\nQuite frankly, this is a stupid and avoidable situation.", "NTA\n\n6 and 7 year old's still need to be supervised when they bathe, obviously.", "Does shampoo even make for a good bubble bath? I've never tried but I seriously doubt it. At best, it'll look like dishwater! Dad needs to get the lead out and pick up some Mr. Bubble when he next shops. Sheesh.", "Yeah, this is a red flag for sure. It will only get worse from here. He can\u2019t even buy bubble bath for his own kids? What\u2019s next? Do you have to share clothes too??", "Exactly. Such a painfully obvious solution. They both sound immature.", "It does not. In my experience as a kid, it\u2019s also not great for your no-no bits.", "Bath time should not be 100% play time. Then basic hygienic needs aren\u2019t met.", "Same thing I thought.  My grandma always told us that sitting in soapy water too long and too often cause UTIs.", "Simple as having a small travel bag to stick enough for a few weekends at a time in", "not 100% but like 75% for kids", "NTA if they want to waste shampoo in the bath, Dollar Tree sells 3-in-1 shampoo/body wash/bubble bath for $1.25. Quick math says $20 would buy\u2026 16 bottles without taxes. Say 15 bottles with taxes. At half a bottle per night (ridiculous) that\u2019s a full month supply!\n\nI have a skin condition requiring super powerful shampoo so no one is going to want to use mine in a bath, but I have bought special bath products for myself in the past and had my husband use them in our son\u2019s bath when my son \u201cran out\u201d of product. But my husband supervised the usage and made sure to replace *both* products.", "NTA. \nI'm sorry you have to parent his kids instead of him.", "NTA.  The kids need to be provided bubble bath liquid, and your shampoo should be for hair only.  And the fact that they're refusing to buy more kids' shampoo or bubble bath is ridiculous.  It's not like bubble bath is all that expensive, so them calling you greedy is pretty telling.  This is basic respect of your personal property.", "NTA\n\nWhat other ways is your BF letting his kids disrespect your property?\n\nI mean, bubble bath is pretty cheap, so why doesn't he simply buy an industrial sized bottle of the stuff?\n\nAlso, the whole \"boy shampoo\" and \"girl shampoo\" BS needs to be shut down.", "NTA.

Oh boy, I remember that phase of young childhood. You know what my mom did? She gave us bubble bath soap. It\u2019s not fair to expect you to waste your expensive shampoo.", "NTA\n\nHell, when my kids where smaller I didn't want them using my shampoo and they were MY kids!\n\nI had my stuff, they had there stuff and bubble bath. Nothing wrong with that.", "Nta. Key word is boyfriend.  You\u2019re getting a picture of this mans terrible parenting skills.

Calling OP a selfish b* and sayin it's just shampoo. If she is so worried, but isn't in their lives at all, she has no rights to tell OP all of that. The fact that she doesn't think what her kids are doing is wrong is crazy to me. Imagine the roles were reserve and the kids do that to the mom too. I'm sure the mom would flip out.", "Me neither. When my (23 & 25) boys were much younger, they would use my shampoo and conditioner. It was relatively expensive and for coloured hair. When I realised why it was running out so quickly, I told them not to use it and I got them slightly better stuff (than the cheap crap I'd been buying them - can't believe at 6 and 7 they noticed, tbh). Obviously, at that age it was my responsibility to ensure they always had enough. I'd be pissed off if I were OP!", "Using shampoo as bubble bath can cause urinary and vaginal infections.", "In my experience it gets bubbly and works quite well.  I'd only use a squirt of it not a whole bottle.  It suds up a lot.\n\nThere's eczema in the house so we don't use irritating shampoos anyways, so it hasn't caused any issues genitally.", "I am not giving mom any prizes but it\u2019s not up to OP to deal with the ex", "This.

Everyone around you is acting out because they don't want to parent their kids.", "YTA, basically you've punished two girls to not have shampoo because their father didn't buy one the next day he knew they are out of it.\n\nIt's completely fine that you don't want that your shampoo is used for bubble bath, but don't borrow it to them because their father forgot/don't bother to buy new during one day is quite petty.", "NTA Please don't let bf, his girls, or their mom make you feel responsible for providing them your high-end shampoo for their bubble baths.

It is far too easy for them to solve the problem by buying what they need and having it in the home. They WANT this to be YOUR problem.\n\nAlso, I know you regret the remark about their mom. That was a mistake coming out of your frustration. The primary troublemaker is your bf - for not teaching his kids to use products in a non-wasteful manner, for not providing what he expects you to provide, and for not respecting the limits of your generosity (willingness to waste!).
