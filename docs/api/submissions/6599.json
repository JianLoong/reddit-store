He has two little girls, both 6 & 7 from a previous marriage. Every weekend I would sleep over and so I would leave my shampoo and conditioner there. Lately, I noticed that my shampoo has been running out really fast. For example, it's brand new and within 2-3 weeks. It's already halfway or less than halfway. The only people who are living with my bf are him, his two kids, his mother, and his half-brother. They have their bathroom so I know it isn't them who uses it. \n\nMy boyfriend has his own he uses, and the girls have theirs also. We bought a fresh new one for them and it ran out within the next week. We found out that they have been using theirs for bubble baths and when they run out, they would use mine. Now I don't mind them using it if it's for their hair, but my shampoos are expensive. They cost at least $20 per bottle. After that had happened on multiple occasions, I stop leaving it in the restroom and keep it hidden in the room. One day the kids were going to shower so they told my bf they didn't have any shampoos and my boyfriend asked if they can use mine. I said fine and put some in the travel size for them. I told my boyfriend he needs to go and buy them a new bottle and he should tell them to stop using it for bubble baths or buy a bubble bath one separately. Well when they finished my boyfriend went to use the restroom and turns out, they used all of it again for bubble baths only. They didn't wash their hair. \n\nThe next day, the same thing happened and my bf asked me again. I told him no, I'm not going to give them anymore. It's not my problem because you knew they were out and you were supposed to go buy them a new one. We got into an argument over it, so I told him to let them use his, but they didn't want to. They said it's a boy shampoo. I stood my ground and said no. He needs to teach them to stop doing that. Well, the argument led to them letting their mom know about it. She called my boyfriend and called me a greedy bitch. That they are just kids and it's just shampoo. I can always go buy some more. I then told my boyfriend, why don't she go buy it then? She's hardly in their life and they only see her every other weekend. My boyfriend didn't say anything but I can tell he agrees with her.", "created_utc": 1672971914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104i1q3/aita_for_not_sharing_shampoos_with_my_boyfriends/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
