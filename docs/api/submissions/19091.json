My mom didn\u2019t want to share custody. She\u2019s explained her reasons to me, but I still don\u2019t fully understand her perspective. The point is I\u2019ve lived with my dad and my mom visits us occasionally, but I haven\u2019t had any real contact with Harrison since he was a kindergartener. In our bi-monthly phone calls, mom has always insisted that everything was fine.\n\nWell, for the first time, mom brought Harrison to visit me and my dad, and it became obvious to me and my dad that everything had not been fine for the past 8 years. Harrison is severely attached to video games. If he\u2019s asked to get off the video games or something else he doesn\u2019t like, he\u2019ll scream at my mom and show her the finger. He failed most of his classes this year because he barely turned in any of his homework.\n\nHarrison\u2019s school made an offer to my mom that if Harrison did summer school (it would be all online without any live lessons/meeting, so entirely at Harrison\u2019s pace) then they would pass him and he would be able to graduate from 8th grade to high school in August. The issue is that my mom says she can\u2019t force Harrison to do his schoolwork. She also said that she can\u2019t handle Harrison anymore in general because he\u2019s a big kid and is still growing.\n\nMy mom said she wants \u201cpoor Harrison\u201d to live with me and my dad for the summer so that my dad can hopefully get Harrison to start listening to her. My dad told her he doesn\u2019t want to. Harrison may be my brother but I also don\u2019t want him living with us. I don\u2019t want to have to suddenly share my room with Harrison, or not be able to have friends over anymore because Harrison will be screaming and throwing fits. Plus, my dad works full-time and I\u2019d probably be the one having to hover over Harrison and fight with him over doing his schoolwork.\n\nDuring a phone call a few days ago, my mom begged me to try and change my dad\u2019s mind because she says that I am the only one who would be able to convince him. I told my mom that I love her, but that Harrison is a mess that she made and therefore she is the one who has to deal with him. I don\u2019t want my summer ruined by having to basically be Harrison\u2019s babysitter and deal with him throwing fits 24/7. Also, Harrison is a big kid but he\u2019s still 13. She could just sell his video games and block all non-school related sites on his computer and there\u2019s literally nothing he\u2019d be able to do about it lol.\n\nI talked about this to my best friend Trystan. But Trystan said he sympathizes a lot with my mom because he also has a brother like Harrison (except Trystan\u2019s has a diagnosed mental disorder and his issues aren\u2019t because of the way he\u2019s been parented.) Trystan said that just removing the video games isn\u2019t as easy as I\u2019m making it out to be. And that putting up with Trystan\u2019s fits 24/7 is what my mom\u2019s done for the past 8 years. So I could at least give up one summer out of love to try and help her.

Your mom just wants to make her own life easier by putting the burden on you and your dad. She needs to step up, admit that she's failing Harrison and get both of them professional help. Sending him to your dad won't help because he doesn't see either of you as an authority figure.", "NTA\n\nYou would be the most impacted here. And you are not responsible for the choices your mom made. She made the situation, and it's time for her to step up.", "NTA it isn\u2019t your job to clean up your mother\u2019s mess. And even if your dad did step in and was effective, what do you think will happen when mom takes over again? Mom needs a parenting class and both she and your brother could use help by a social worker or other professional. Your brother may also benefit from addiction counselling. Bottom line, this situation does not seem like it can be resolved without hard work from mom and brother.", "NTA\n\nShe's the parent, not you. \n\nINFO: What were her reasons for not wanting to share custody?", "NTA. Sending Harrison away from his home and making him live with you guys is just as likely to make him even more defiant as it is to help him. And even if it works, he's (presumably) going right back at the end of the summer and unless mom takes the time off to really shape up her own parenting he's just going to go right back to walking all over her, starting a vicious cycle.", "NTA, but I think it's more that your more shouldn't be asking you to parent your sibling. I think there are probably some other underlying issues that your mom may not want to deal with. Having said that you're NTA though, you should still respect your mother. You don't know what she has and hasn't tried with your brother. And you may only be getting your dad's side of the story, or no side at all. Or maybe the side that your mom is giving you, without wanting to sound like a total failure. \n\nRegardless, cut your mom some slack, but don't raise your brother.", "NTA. Your 16 ( if my math is correct) and you shouldn\u2019t have to take care of a 13 year old that you honestly barely know. You\u2019re quite wise, Mom created this mess, let her figure it out.", "NTA her fault she probably ruined him", "NTA, you are not the patent of your brother, he is NOT your responsibility. And your mother set the precedent, she was the one that set the custody boundaries.", ">So I could at least give up one summer out of love to try and help her.\n\nYou can't help her. You are correct this will get shoved on you and you can't do anything to help here. Out of love. Like how she basically abandoned you? NTA.", "NTA. Ultimately it is your fathers choice if he wants to parent his son. At no point is your brother your son or responsibility. Watching him here and there over the summer is different than taking over his parenting for the whole summer while your father is at work. \nYou do need to cut your mom some slack, she did create these issues, but like others are saying there may be some underlying issues. I would definitely say that your mom needs to get your brother in therapy asap. She needs to work on limiting his games, even with the tantrums. I know it can be difficult and horrible at times but she is the parent. She may have to physically unplug the systems and lock them up. \nIf he is refusing to do his homework she needs to rid him of distractions. See if there are options with your father about taking him for a shorter period of time. She likely needs a break, not that, that should fall into your lap. Discuss as a family what the true options are. Your mother shouldn\u2019t be asking you to convince your father, they are the parents this is a choice for them to make.  You should be involved with the conversation since you would be sharing your safe space with your brother. \n\nThere are options here, more than take him or don\u2019t take him. Your mom may be asking for help in the only way she knows how.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parenting is not a part time job, she is either ALL IN or ALL OUT.  I agree with dad for the summer, but would be open to full custody, it is his child as well.\n\nEven IF your brother stayed and was somehow turned around by summers end, what then?  He goes back to mom and starts all over again and, again, she will want to drop him off with you guys AGAIN next summer.", "NTA.

I never said they don\u2019t have to deal with the consequences of their mistakes.", "NTA - but your parents are. \n\nThey didn't want to split custody, so they each effectively abandoned one of you? And then raised you apart from your sibling? What a horrible arrangement.

He should have fought for visits with Harrison and once it became clear Harrison has significant issues, gone into emergency response mode to try and triage this situation.\n\nInstead, he's just dumped his own kid.\n\nI'm not very impressed with you, either, because your reasons are extremely superficial and short sighted. While this is not your issue to fix, you lack a lot of empathy and are only concerned with the bottom line of how it affects you.\n\nI say take the middle path of encouraging your dad to get involved with Harrison, while Harrison still lives with mom for now. Perhaps suggest that he suggest a parenting class for her, or a support group for gaming addicts for Harrison.", "NTA... this is not your responsibility!\n\nTaking away the video games will benefit your brother but it will mean dealing with the problems that using video games in the place of parenting has caused.

What is to keep him from attacking you?  He is addicted to games and has melt downs when told to get off them. What would he do when he has to share a room and it is late night and you want to sleep.  Once again he is addicted she needs to get professional help with this.  Moving to his dad's home for the summer (most likely forever) will not work.  Nor should you have to be put in this position.", "NTA.
