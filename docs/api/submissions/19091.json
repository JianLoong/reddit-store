Harrison is severely attached to video games. If he\u2019s asked to get off the video games or something else he doesn\u2019t like, he\u2019ll scream at my mom and show her the finger.

The issue is that my mom says she can\u2019t force Harrison to do his schoolwork.

Ultimately it is your fathers choice if he wants to parent his son. At no point is your brother your son or responsibility. Watching him here and there over the summer is different than taking over his parenting for the whole summer while your father is at work. \nYou do need to cut your mom some slack, she did create these issues, but like others are saying there may be some underlying issues. I would definitely say that your mom needs to get your brother in therapy asap. She needs to work on limiting his games, even with the tantrums. I know it can be difficult and horrible at times but she is the parent. She may have to physically unplug the systems and lock them up. \nIf he is refusing to do his homework she needs to rid him of distractions. See if there are options with your father about taking him for a shorter period of time. She likely needs a break, not that, that should fall into your lap. Discuss as a family what the true options are. Your mother shouldn\u2019t be asking you to convince your father, they are the parents this is a choice for them to make.  You should be involved with the conversation since you would be sharing your safe space with your brother. \n\nThere are options here, more than take him or don\u2019t take him.

At 11, he was regularly sent home from school for being disruptive and combative, and used to simulate intense pain to stay at home (of course, the second mom called the school to say he was staying home, he was jumping on the couch and using the switch, the tablet and the laptop simultaneously). Dad tried a bit but was already checked out. Now at 12, he hasn't be to school in 6 months (illegal in my country but still), only leave his room to steal mom credit card, knife the couch or bash the kitchen granit counter. Mommy is finally seeing was she has done and doesn't understand why dad (who has since left her) can't manage their son's tantrum. But for years, she never did anything with him except giving him her phone or tablet to play on. The food was instant ramen or cold cans of beans, the cuddle she gave the dog, never the son, the bath, the homework, everything else she delegated to her husband.

I'd ask more and if it doesn't sound like she's purposely neglectful while she sleeps or parties, then maybe think how you guys could *help* them.", "NTA. It sounds like your friend is coming from a well-meaning place, and most likely imagining Harrison as their brother without fully understanding the differences. As someone with a sibling with special needs, I am definitely overly sensitive to people with disabilities and it takes life experience/time to separate your feelings for your sibling from the realities of another situation.", "NTA\n\nThe one time your mom show your brother is to get rid of him ?! seriously ?\n\nit is just like that mother who contact her daughter after 13 years to ask a kidney for the half-sister.", "NTA\n\nHarrison needs help from a therapist or something. Not be bounced around from house to house and a different parental authority! Indeed your mother messed up, so she should deal with it, not just dump him", "NTA\n\nI think you and Trystan are really good kids. I think it's very open-minded of you to wonder if Trystan has a point. Trystan sounds like a caring, sympathetic person - good qualities. BUT his logic doesn't hold up.\n\nHe is absolutely right that getting rid of video games isn't a snap; nor does it guarantee that Harrison will do any work. Trystan is also right that your mom has had to deal with Harrison's fits for the past 8 years. That is the end of what he got right. Here's what Trystan missed:\n\n1. If it is hard for Harrison's adult parent, then what chance does a sibling only 3 years older and disconnected for the past 8 years have?\n2. Why in the world, should a teen be made responsible for the parenting? Why should a teen be made responsible for fixing bad parenting by the parent?\n3. And yes, your dad is there, but his primary obligation is to you (because your mom insisted on giving each of the parents primary responsibility for one child). He knows this would be mostly a burden on you that he needs to protect you from. \n4. Tantrums are never fun to deal with, but a good parent deals with them and helps a child grow out of them early on. Your mom failed to do that. She CHOSE to seek sole custody of Harrison. She chose to use video games as a substitute parent for herself. She chose not to seek outside help or to address the issues as they developed over the past 8 years. If she had done the hard work earlier or reached out for help earlier, she might not have had 8 years of tantrums.", "NTA. And frankly, I\u2019m not sure what your mom thinks you and your dad are gonna do to \u201cmake Harrison listen to her\u201d", "NTA. But your mom is an asshole for involving a child (you!) in custody decisions. This is a matter for your parents to settle between themselves.", "If they take Harrison even for a day, mom will bolt and go LC or NC again", "The mom and dad are the assholes. Who would agree to this bizarre arrangement???", "I agree that I think dad is just as much an AH as mom. He hasn\u2019t seen his son in 8 years? When mom visited did she not bring Harrison with her? \n\nHe let this happen just as much as mom did. And they need to fix it.", "How is any of that on op", "What did op do wrong", "I can\u2019t wrap my head around why the dad (and sister) didn\u2019t have regular contact/visitation with Harrison.", "Which I don't understand.  So Dad took one kid 100% and Mom took the other kid 100% and the two sides just never interacted?  I've never heard of anything like this.  Frankly, it strains credulity.", "Not to mention that OP said she\u2019d have to share a room with the brother were he to move in. Hell to the no.", "It's kinda obvious the Mom doesn't care about OP.NAT"]}
