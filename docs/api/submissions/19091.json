The issue is that my mom says she can\u2019t force Harrison to do his schoolwork.

Ultimately it is your fathers choice if he wants to parent his son. At no point is your brother your son or responsibility. Watching him here and there over the summer is different than taking over his parenting for the whole summer while your father is at work. \nYou do need to cut your mom some slack, she did create these issues, but like others are saying there may be some underlying issues. I would definitely say that your mom needs to get your brother in therapy asap. She needs to work on limiting his games, even with the tantrums. I know it can be difficult and horrible at times but she is the parent. She may have to physically unplug the systems and lock them up. \nIf he is refusing to do his homework she needs to rid him of distractions. See if there are options with your father about taking him for a shorter period of time. She likely needs a break, not that, that should fall into your lap. Discuss as a family what the true options are. Your mother shouldn\u2019t be asking you to convince your father, they are the parents this is a choice for them to make.  You should be involved with the conversation since you would be sharing your safe space with your brother. \n\nThere are options here, more than take him or don\u2019t take him.

At 11, he was regularly sent home from school for being disruptive and combative, and used to simulate intense pain to stay at home (of course, the second mom called the school to say he was staying home, he was jumping on the couch and using the switch, the tablet and the laptop simultaneously). Dad tried a bit but was already checked out. Now at 12, he hasn't be to school in 6 months (illegal in my country but still), only leave his room to steal mom credit card, knife the couch or bash the kitchen granit counter. Mommy is finally seeing was she has done and doesn't understand why dad (who has since left her) can't manage their son's tantrum. But for years, she never did anything with him except giving him her phone or tablet to play on.

She chose to give Harrison video games with seemingly few boundaries. \nShe chose this exact situation, whether she wants to admit that to herself or not.\nWhich makes it very different from the situation your friend had, meaning his advice is not fit for purpose.\n\nEven with all that aside, you'd still be NTA. I'm not sure what magical parenting tricks your mother thinks your father has but overcoming an obviously deep and pervasive video game addiction is going to take more than a summer and no amount of \"you shouldn't talk to your mother like that\" from your father is going to change that. \n\nIf mom wants a change, she has to be the one to make it. Passing the buck is not a solution.", "NTA. No, just removing the video games wouldn't be enough, and he might get violent over that. That being said, that's exactly why you shouldn't be handling this situation. The best outcome for your brother is to get professional help. Your brother needs rehab, and that can't be done in just a summer.", "LOL, NTA and your friend is wholly ignorant. Your mom literally made this mess, and is now wanting someone else to clean it up. She made th decision to want sole custody of your brother and to be the \"cool , fun\" parent. Those were conscious decisions. Now, she's dealing with a 13 year old whose failing school and is screen addicted thanks to her non-existing parenting. Instead of parenting up and being taking responsibility, she's trying to dump him on you and your dad to fix the problem, letting her remain the fun parent. She made her bed, she can lie in it.", "And why was mother willing to barely ever see OP?", "Likewise, why did the mother not want any custody of OP? Bimonthly phonecalls, wtf.\n\n\"I'm not very impressed with you, either, because your reasons are extremely superficial and short sighted. While this is not your issue to fix, you lack a lot of empathy and are only concerned with the bottom line of how it affects you.\"\n\nThis is nonsense. The proposed 'solution' - OP becomes a working-hours babysitter for a child she hasn't met in 8 years, and who refuses to listen to his own mother - is not a solution at all. Indeed, it's the worst of all worlds, with both parents palming off responsibility for their child onto another child. It will likely do more harm than good to both siblings.\n\nThe only way OP could potentially rebuild a relationship with her brother would be through short, supervised visits in which he does not have access to his games. Then, perhaps a year or two down the line, OP may be in a position to be a productive influence in her brother's life. But right now what is being suggested by the mother is all or nothing.", "Something odd is going on if op's mom separated the siblings for this long. This isn't something you spring on someone if you actually want to help your child grow. Sounds like op's mom just wants a break from exactly what op said, her mess.", "Dad should not suffer for Mom's fuck up", "Sounds about right. Can easily see some kind of quid pro quo between the parents; dad will still pay mom child support for child #2, and in exchange mom gives up custody of child #1 completely.", "This is very parent trap. Each parent takes a kid.", "It's his kid too, I assume he would want the best for him", "OP is like 16, so you're assuming that they would know one way or the other.", "Info:  Is maybe your brother not your dad's kid? I mean, generally when there is a divorce, parents can see both kids on different momments, or mom keeps all of the kids most of the time. Why were you two separated?", "NTA He may be your brother, but he shouldn't be your problem, nor your dad's. Sounds like he needs a military boarding school.", "Your love for brother is... nope you don't love your brother. Not your mother too. You only care for your comfort. And you ask if you are AH. Of course you are. Your father and your mother too. You and your father KNOW that your mother can't handle your brother and with a perfect logic you say that she has to deal with him because she can't.\nYour brother is and will be a loser because no one cares for him. Again, you, your father and all NTAs are AH.", "ESH", "NTA", "NTA I absolutely love your reasoning and understanding of a situation for someone so young. You're totally right, it's your mums problem, and he is a problem and one you and your Dad don't have to fix. Sounds like he needs boot camp, not a bad kid but needs some structural interference in his life and he's just the right age", "NTA \nBut your dads TA. That's his son.", "NTA. Your mum is.just trying to fob off her son on your dad so she can wash her hands of him. If somehow Harrison improves, she will likely pressure your dad to keep him (and by extension, you will be responsible as you have stated in your post)  \n\n>Trystan said that just removing the video games isn\u2019t as easy as I\u2019m making it out to be.   \n\nIt fucking well **is** that simple. My mum used to take the power cables for the PC, Xbox etc to work with her if we hadn't done any chores, and we got them back the day *after* the chores were done.", "NTA. Bad parenting is not the same as a diagnosed problem, and isn't treated the same. This is well beyond anything a teenager should be dealing with. Your parents need to put Harrison in therapy, or more likely, inpatient, for his gaming addiction. Your dad is going to have to take off work and probably take FMLA leave if Harrison lives with you. Don't do it.", "NTA! Ur mother made her bad and now she can continue to sleep I. It. That's what she'll tell u if u messed up big in ur life", "Nope. NTA. But your mum is a gaping one. She caused the problem with her lack of any parenting. Not yours or your Dads problem to fix", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"So I could at least give up one summer out of love to try and help her.\" .. This is stupid. YOU are NOT his parent.", "nta", "Best guess. It was the child of an affair. Hence why OPs mother and brother were gone for 8 years, and they don't physically visit. \nAlso, probably the main reason why OPs dad doesn't want to take him in.", "Or perhaps the parents could actually, you know, parent and leave OP out of it completely. Not wanting to take on responsibility for a kid you barely know is not 'lacking empathy'. And with how weird this family dynamic is, I have a feeling there's a reason mom wanted only Harrison and dad went along with it .", "Yeah, no. Dad took one kid, mom took one kid, as I understand at moms request.", "Exactly. Even if the mom pushed for this ridiculous arrangement why isn't dad more concerned about his kid?", "Because neither of them are good parents. They both accepted to hardly ever see their other child (it reads almost like the dad hadn't seen his younger son at all in 8 years), mum fucked her her youngest's education, and dad now refuses to help that child. \nWho pays the price in the end? The kids, as always.", "All of them. Obviously.\n\nNTA", "If he went along with this ridiculous custody agreement rather than fighting for the actual best interests of his son, then yes he absolutely should suffer as it\u2019s just as much his fuck up as hers!", "Younger brother may be from an AP.", "Dad should want what's best for both kids, and having the younger brother stay with them would only make life hell for the older kid and Dad, and likely would not help the younger kid at all.  The mother **chose** full custody and **chose** to keep Dad out of the younger boy's life. One summer is not going to fix years of bad parenting from the mother.  Now that the boy is 13, he absolutely will not see Dad as any kind of authority figure; Dad is a stranger to that boy. There is no relationship between them other than genetics, and it takes more than semen to make anyone a real parent. \n\nOP is NTA, and Dad is NTA. Both are absolutely right. The mother insisted on full custody, kept them out of the boy's life, prevented Dad from becoming any sort of authority figure to the kid, and is now trying to dump the kid because he's hit his early teens and is no longer the cute little kid she wanted him to stay as *(yeah, that part's easy to see between the lines)*.  The mother has the legal custody/obligation to raise her kid, just as she insisted on all those years ago, and that's backed by the court and that custody decision.\n\nWith all that said, depending on the laws and courts in OP's area concerning child support & what the custody agreement actually entailed, Dad may wish to offer to help pay for counseling/rehabilitation and/or special schooling for the boy. But taking over custody of the kid, no.\n\n*(Edited to add: sorry for possible triple post. Reddit didn't want to place this under who I was actually replying to??)*", "Why would he agree then. \n\nThis is reddit fanfiction and it's ridiculous.", "Then it would make no sense for her to send him to OP's father."]}
