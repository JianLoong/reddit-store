In our bi-monthly phone calls, mom has always insisted that everything was fine.\n\nWell, for the first time, mom brought Harrison to visit me and my dad, and it became obvious to me and my dad that everything had not been fine for the past 8 years. Harrison is severely attached to video games. If he\u2019s asked to get off the video games or something else he doesn\u2019t like, he\u2019ll scream at my mom and show her the finger.

The issue is that my mom says she can\u2019t force Harrison to do his schoolwork.

Ultimately it is your fathers choice if he wants to parent his son. At no point is your brother your son or responsibility. Watching him here and there over the summer is different than taking over his parenting for the whole summer while your father is at work. \nYou do need to cut your mom some slack, she did create these issues, but like others are saying there may be some underlying issues. I would definitely say that your mom needs to get your brother in therapy asap. She needs to work on limiting his games, even with the tantrums. I know it can be difficult and horrible at times but she is the parent. She may have to physically unplug the systems and lock them up. \nIf he is refusing to do his homework she needs to rid him of distractions. See if there are options with your father about taking him for a shorter period of time. She likely needs a break, not that, that should fall into your lap. Discuss as a family what the true options are. Your mother shouldn\u2019t be asking you to convince your father, they are the parents this is a choice for them to make.  You should be involved with the conversation since you would be sharing your safe space with your brother. \n\nThere are options here, more than take him or don\u2019t take him.

At 11, he was regularly sent home from school for being disruptive and combative, and used to simulate intense pain to stay at home (of course, the second mom called the school to say he was staying home, he was jumping on the couch and using the switch, the tablet and the laptop simultaneously). Dad tried a bit but was already checked out. Now at 12, he hasn't be to school in 6 months (illegal in my country but still), only leave his room to steal mom credit card, knife the couch or bash the kitchen granit counter. Mommy is finally seeing was she has done and doesn't understand why dad (who has since left her) can't manage their son's tantrum. But for years, she never did anything with him except giving him her phone or tablet to play on. The food was instant ramen or cold cans of beans, the cuddle she gave the dog, never the son, the bath, the homework, everything else she delegated to her husband.

The proposed 'solution' - OP becomes a working-hours babysitter for a child she hasn't met in 8 years, and who refuses to listen to his own mother - is not a solution at all. Indeed, it's the worst of all worlds, with both parents palming off responsibility for their child onto another child. It will likely do more harm than good to both siblings.\n\nThe only way OP could potentially rebuild a relationship with her brother would be through short, supervised visits in which he does not have access to his games.

Now that the boy is 13, he absolutely will not see Dad as any kind of authority figure; Dad is a stranger to that boy. There is no relationship between them other than genetics, and it takes more than semen to make anyone a real parent. \n\nOP is NTA, and Dad is NTA. Both are absolutely right.

The mother has the legal custody/obligation to raise her kid, just as she insisted on all those years ago, and that's backed by the court and that custody decision.\n\nWith all that said, depending on the laws and courts in OP's area concerning child support & what the custody agreement actually entailed, Dad may wish to offer to help pay for counseling/rehabilitation and/or special schooling for the boy.

The fact that your father also agreed to that and your mother can't adequately explain why makes me speculate that Harrison may not be biologically your dad's child.

And given mum is likely putting games in front of Harrison so he'll stop pestering her then she's not gonna be that willing to deal with tantrums.\n\nAlso if the kid is more tech-savvy than mum, they can probably bypass firewall rules.
