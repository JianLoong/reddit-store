{"id": 34019, "submission_id": "18u3jek", "title": "AITA for making my ex leave my house after he came to visit our son a few days after Christmas?", "selftext": "Me 27f and my ex 33m broke up 4 years ago, for Christmas he wasn\u2019t able to come visit our son 6m because he went out of state to visit his girlfriends family, but he made time to come visit him when he got back from his trip to see all the gifts he got, help him set everything up, which is fine. I got my son a used iPhone 8 for Christmas because it\u2019s what I could afford, and my son was happy and very appreciative of his new phone like any 6 year old would be. But when my ex saw the phone he got upset and started yelling and berating me for getting him an iPhone 8 instead of something more exclusive like a iPhone 12-14 (Mind you this man didn\u2019t spend a dollar on Christmas gifts for my son despite having a good job and working there for 4 years)\n\nSo I told him to stop yelling at me in front of our son firstly, and second I paid for the phone and our son likes it, he\u2019s only 6 he doesn\u2019t need a iPhone 14, But he wasn\u2019t trying to hear it, he kept yelling and he eventually said \u201cI\u2019m going to buy him a better phone and keep it at my house because you\u2019re a cheap b-word\u201d and before I could even respond my son who was watching everything took the phone and threw it and said \u201cyeah this phone sucks\u201d that set me off because my son loved his new phone until his dad came in here and started yelling about it being a bad and cheap phone, so I told him to leave but he refused to leave and still yelling he told me I can\u2019t deny him seeing his son since he couldn\u2019t see him for Christmas, I threatened to call the police if he didn\u2019t leave, he proceeded to call me more terrible names in front of our son before he left. Since his mom and girlfriend started texting me calling me names and accused me of being jealous and bitter for kicking him out when he only wanted to see his son, but I haven\u2019t responded to them. After my ex left my son was upset because he loves spending time with his dad and hated to see him go but wouldn\u2019t you know\u2026 he picked his phone up and started playing roblox with his cousins and hasn\u2019t complained about the phone since. Although I did feel bad for my son when he was crying about his dad leaving I think I did the right thing by making him leave because he was being disrespectful by yelling, belittling me and calling me names in front of our son, but my son really didn\u2019t want him to leave.

I mean a small spat is one thing, but a complete meltdown with swearing and name calling?  Unacceptable!  You still have a right to feel safe in your own home, and while your son may not understand it, his behavior could easily be described as unsafe. \n\nStill, you need to solve this with your ex as best as you can when he cools down. Holidays are stressful, and maybe not the best time. Just let him know you are willing to make up the time but only if you two have a civil discussion on the matter first... bring a friend or family member who he is scared of. Seriously, if you have anyone, bring them to temper his ego.", "ESH for getting a 6 year old an iphone at all.\n\nLook, your ex behaved poorly and kicking him out for treating you with disrespect was the right thing to do.\n\nTHe girl friend and his Mom have no place texting you at all.\n\nSis, it might be time to get a firm court order surrounding custody and child support in place. You do not deserve to have to put up with this.", "NTA but respectfully why tf are you giving a 6 yo a phone", "NTA. Your ex showed his ass in a big way. Generally speaking, if a parent misses their scheduled visitation, you're not obligated to schedule a make up. You were being flexible and kind to both him and your son. And he screwed it up. I'd get real black and white about following that court order from now on. No more favors. Not if he's going to use your goodwill to traumatize your kid.", "Oof- this man is difficult. NTA. I would look for ways to deescalate this...\n\n1) Tell him you want to support his relationship with your son but you want to extract yourself from the situation. From now on you'll drop your son to meet him at a mall, a park, a movie, McDonald's - but you won't be staying for the visit.\n\n2) Get monitored third party email for communication with your ex. He can coordinate visits without insults. Your divorce attorney can facilitate this.\n\n3) Start blocking his extended family. They aren't doing you or your son any favors and you aren't obligated to maintain a relationship with any of them. They can now text your son directly, as long as they're polite and don't insult you. Block them from his phone if they can't respect that.\n\n4) Look for a counselor for your son - preferably a dude. And maybe a big brother program, and sports with male coaches. He's at the age where he's desperate to identify with his Dad - thus chiming in on the phone insult - but his dad isn't a good guy and deep down he probably knows that.", "Nta", "NTA but you need to have a serious talk to you 6 year old about that behavior.

I know he is young and all but what kind of kid throwing a gift away? If i did that at 6, my parents sending me to orbit.\n\nKeep ur ex at a distance.", "NTA. Not in your home. Save those texts, screenshot any conversations about you. That is harassment.", "NTA do not allow him in your home ever again. If he wants to see his son, you can meet in a public location. I'm so glad you showed your son that his father's behavior was absolutely unacceptable by making him leave. That's really so, so important. Even though it's tough because your little guy was upset by it.", "You need to sit down and have a heart to heart. Talk about why you made dad leave, why calling people names is wrong, how if throwing the phone hurt your feelings, etc. use these as teaching moments.\n\nSave the text messages from his mom and gf. If they continue then file harassment against them.\n\nNot sure if ex is in child support or not but make sure he is. Start recording all talks with the dad. You might now need them but better safe then sorry.", "NTA.
