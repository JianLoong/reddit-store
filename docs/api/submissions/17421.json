I'm a 35M, single and have always been a huge dog lover. Recently, I've been considering adopting a dog as I work from home and feel ready for the companionship.\n\nI visited a local shelter last week and instantly fell in love with a 2-year-old German Shepherd, \"Max.\" Max was playful, sweet, and well-behaved. I decided to adopt him on the spot.\n\nHere's the catch: my sister \"Lisa\" (38F) and her son, my nephew \"Jamie\" (10M), had visited the same shelter the day before I did. Jamie had also taken a liking to Max, but Lisa decided against adopting him as they already have a cat and she didn't think they had the time or resources to take care of a dog too.\n\nWhen I brought Max home and posted a picture of him on social media, Jamie was heartbroken. He accused me of stealing his dog. Lisa called me and demanded I give Max to Jamie. She said I knew how much Jamie wanted a dog and it was cruel of me to adopt Max knowing that.\n\nThe thing is, Lisa never told me they were considering adopting Max. I had no idea Jamie was attached to him. I told her this, but she still thinks I should give up Max.\n\nI love Jamie, but I've also grown quite attached to Max in the short time he's been with me. I also believe Lisa made the right call initially as they aren't ready for the responsibility a dog like Max would require.\n\nSo, AITA for adopting a dog that my nephew had his heart set on after his parents said no?\n\nTL;DR: Unknowingly adopted a dog my nephew wanted but his parents refused to get. Now, they're demanding I give up the dog.\n\n**EDIT: Thanks for your responses. I wanted to clarify that I've offered to bring Max over for visits and have Jamie involved in his care, but my sister insists that's not enough.

Your sister doesn't have to do any caring for the dog.", "NTA. Your sister had the chance to adopt the dog, she declined, someone else showed up and decided that they wanted the dog and adopted said dog.\n\nYour sister is being unrealistic.

Did adopting the dog cost you anything, and is it possible your sister was waffling on the issue because of the price? Did she offer to pay for the expenses for the dog or is she just demanding you hang over the dog for free? \n\nYou can\u2019t just demand other people\u2019s property for free. You also can\u2019t walk out of the shelter without the dog and expect to be able to just change your mind and go back later and have it still be there.

Make copies of the adoption papers too and store them somewhere your sister can\u2019t access, ideally outside of your home. If your sister thinks she should just be able to demand you hand over a living creature because she took too long to decide, I\u2019m not entirely convinced she wouldn\u2019t just take him, or try to. Taking those steps should help you to prove his ownership should the issue arrive, but I wouldn\u2019t be asking her to dog sit any time soon/ever. \n\nIt sucks for your nephew, but your sister needs to decide whether she\u2019s in a position to adopt a dog and what breeds, temperaments and traits she is happy to accept before she takes her kid to a shelter and lets him form attachments to the dogs. Unless it\u2019s a shelter that allows holds for dogs that are being considered (and most wouldn\u2019t for a healthy 2 year old German shepherd: there\u2019s no need), she was ALWAYS setting her kid up for heartbreak.

But now when it's super convenient for them and they are asking for your pet.\n\nAlso your nephew is at an age where he can grasp how pet adoption works and what stealing is and the difference between these.

Which household will be better for the dog? Seriously, you sound like a pretty level-headed person. Probably plan to train that dog because that is a working dog and it is happiest when it has a purpose. Doesn't sound like the other household would pursue that kind of commitment to the dog. Just my two cents.", "NTA Max was meant for you", "NTA: Your sister is lying there no way she wanted the dog or thinking about it because if she was seriously thinking Max would have been adopted. \n\nShe only wants Max now because you have him and has to hear her son whinge. Your nephew should have been told straight away Max isn\u2019t his dog. \n\nBut mirochip your dog and ask your nephew does he want to help out with Max he can but he a little entitled same with his mother.", "Info; Is there a chance that your sister was knocked back by the shelter?", "Nta. Ultimately they left the shelter without a dog. It\u2019s unfortunate that you happened to take home the one your nephew wanted. Your suggestion to take max over to allow your nephew to help in his care was reasonable in my opinion. \nI would let it blow over and keep my dog.", "NTA, this could easily be spun as the \"best of both worlds\" -- mom and dad are happy because the dog would be too much for their household, but your nephew gets to see and play with the dog whenever he visits.  It sounds like you live close so that would be pretty often?", "NTA, you didn't know and the pupper wasn't reserved. Congratulations on the new best friend", "People are unbelievable sometimes. If I were the kids mom in that situation I would be thrilled and let the kids know this is a great situation because now the dog he wanted was nearby and with family so he could still play with it while not having to take care of it", "I\u2019m pretty sure you sign paperwork when you adopt from a shelter that you have to return the dog to that shelter if you aren\u2019t keeping it. You can\u2019t just give them away to whoever. Tell your sister to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is not doing her son any favours with her attitude. She has an opportunity to teach him an important life lesson here but instead, she is choosing to make you the bad guy.\n\nI would also like to add that I think it is ultimately very unhelpful to you and Max for your nephew to be involved in his care. You wouldn't do that with a child, I can't see doing that for a dog is any different. They are still going to be your family member for life.", "A German shepherd is a very specific kind of dog, with high needs in terms of exercise and mental stimulation. If they think they weren't ready for a dog, they definitely are not ready for Max.\n\nThe real question has to be what is best for the dog. Max has already begun to bond with you and you seem much better placed to provide the exercise, discipline, and enrichment Max needs. That should settle the matter, and your nephew should be taught that Max is a living being and not a toy that should be passed along to whomever demands it loudest.", "NTA anyone could have adopted Max in the time she's claiming she was reconsidering adopting him. She's absolutely lying about that so your nephew is mad at you and not his Mom. You did a great thing by adopting him! And offering your nephew to help with him.", "NTA. \n\nThere is a reason your sister decided against getting Max. \n\nJust because you happened to get him, doesn\u2019t mean your sister deserves him. She had her chance & decided against it. If some stranger got Max she wouldn\u2019t say anything. Because she wouldn\u2019t see the dog again. \n\nBecause you happened To get the dog that her son liked, that she didn\u2019t want, she sees it as her son resenting her because it\u2019s going to be in the family & her son will continuously ask why they couldn\u2019t have him and you could.  Because she doesn\u2019t want to be honest with her son &  herself, she\u2019s using you as the scapegoat. \n\nDon\u2019t give up the dog you like. Your nephew will be able to see him through you. Turn the situation into a good situation, no matter what negative situation your sister is trying to do.", "Nta. It actually works out well for the kid. His mom wont let him have a dog And now his uncle has one that he can come play with.", ">I also believe Lisa made the right call initially as they aren't ready for the responsibility a dog like Max would require.\n\nThis right there makes you NTA. She didn't think they're ready, you think they are not ready, so regardless of anyone's feelings or attachments, the dog should not be with them.", "Your sister is ta for trying to put her son's disappointment on you instead of her, when you did absolutely nothing wrong. It was/is sister's mess. If she wasn't going to get a dog, she shouldn't have taken her son to the shelter and got his hopes up. Since she now wants you to give her the dog, is it possible that she's just too cheap to pay to adopt a dog? I have learned that if you find something you really want and it's not mass produced, buy it right then bc when you come back it will be gone.", "NTA you had no idea about it. But even so, that's the risk you take when you leave a shelter without the animal that you were still considering. That it would get adopted. They should be happy that at least it was adopted by family and is now part of the family, even if not directly theirs. Had that happen where i fell in love w an older shelter cat. Been there for months, no one adopted. But I forgot my ID so i had to come in the next day. Next day, she was adopted before i got there. \n\n\nAlso. Get Max chipped and everything to make it well known he is yours ASAP, maybe?", "Info: how did you find out about the dog in the first place? If it\u2019s because they told you about it and rushed right over the next day, yta.", "NTA\n\nIf someone didn't adopt the dog, it would have been euthanized. German Shepherds are high needs dogs that often get returned to shelters because people adopt them not knowing what care and training they need, plus they are put down in higher numbers than say labradors or chihuahuas because of those needs.\n\nAs other comments have said, if they weren't ready for a dog, they would not be able to properly train and handle a German Shepherd. Plus the cat being in the mix, if they don't have time to train and properly socialize the dog, the cat might have been hurt or killed. They may have had to return the dog to the shelter and Max would have become another statistic.\n\nNot going to comment on how annoying your sister is, but you're NTA and have done nothing wrong. You can explain to your nephew later when this dies down; \"Your mom said no to the dog and it was at a kill shelter. If I hadn't adopted him, he might have been put to sleep. Instead, now he's at my house and you can see him happy and healthy whenever you visit.\" The kid needs to understand that a shelter pet that isn't rehomed is a dead shelter pet.", "I wonder if they were knocked back for the dog unsuitable living arrangements. Explains why OP sister expects the dog now and didn\u2019t adopt it when she had the chance or is just a cheapskate and didn\u2019t want to pay.", "GSDs are wonderful dogs, but many are also notorious cat killers \ud83d\ude48 I doubt Jamie would want a dog that ate Fluffy.", "This person clearly hasn't had a relationship with an actual human being before. His sister isn't going to just steal his dog. They are adults having a disagreement, not emotional terrorists.", "Ngl that bold text jumpscared me", "Isn\u2019t this the best of both worlds? They don\u2019t have to deal with the responsibility of a doggo & Jamie gets to be a part of the doggie\u2019s life. Win-win.", "well that sounds like her problem. this is not a tough situation all around op. your sister is just acting crazy", "I definitely think you\u2019re on to something! Our shelter is selective with certain breeds on what homes they go to, depending on the individual dog. We had a malamute for about 6 months, lots of people wanted him but you can\u2019t exactly send a 200 lb untrained dominant dog home with anyone and expect it to work. He got a great home with someone that had experience instead of being returned over and over, and he is definitely the best version of the dog that left the shelter because of it. Wouldn\u2019t be surprising if they denied her for the same reasons.", "Any chance it was the cost of the dog prohibiting her from getting and and that's why she has had a sudden change of heart? If you give her the dog. NTA and please keep the dog for yourself, your sister needs to parent.", "Also once you get the microchip, register it.", "Yeah that\u2019s exactly what I was thinking! Some people tend to think that dogs just sit around at the pound for weeks or months looking sad & waiting for the perfect family, but a young/ purebred dog is likely to go quick! \n\nWhen I adopted my last dog, I was planning on waiting a week or two before bringing a dog home & was just stopping by to check out the rescue facility\u2026 But they had a litter of puppies there that were exactly what I\u2019d been looking for (of course). \n\nI had to pick out a puppy, pay for her, & sign all the paperwork right in that moment. They don\u2019t typically do \u201cholds\u201d, or wait around for just the right person to come along... They want their pets to find *homes* ASAP, & find owners who are certain about what they can reasonably handle. When I came to pick her up the next day, all of her littermates (5 of them!) had already been adopted as well. \n\nThe other option here would have likely been Max getting snatched up by someone else & none of you ever seeing him again. \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA at all & I hope that you & Max have a long & happy life together- I\u2019m certain your nephew will be happy to be able to come visit & play with him once heightened emotions have had a chance to settle down. There are plenty of other dogs out there who will fit into their lifestyle once they feel more ready to commit.", "Agree just haven\u2019t had it done yet", "It really sounds like your sister and her family knew they weren't able to truly care for a high-energy dog like a GS. They knew better in the moment, and the backtracking is just weird.", "Have you checked the adoption papers? Most shelters microchip animals before adopting them out.", "And it's very likely that a purebred dog would have been adopted by someone else before Jamie's mom made her mind up. \n\nOP is NTA, and shouldn't give up his dog."]}
