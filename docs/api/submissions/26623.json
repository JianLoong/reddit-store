As far as I am concerned I was raised by romanians in romania so I am romanian.\n\nAlso my last name is \u201cNegru\u201d which is a pretty common romanian last name and it means black. It\u2019s also one of the nicknames my family uses for eachother.\n\nMy girlfriend(f25) recently moved in with me and she wanted to invite some of her friends I hadn\u2019t met yet, for a dinner party.\n\nAt the same time, my brother(m27) is in town for 1 week for a buisness trip. So I offered he stay with us instead of him wasting money on a hotel room.\n\nWell yesterday was the dinner party. My brother was away for most of it for his buisness meeting. \n\nThe party went great for the most part. However there was this one person i\u2019ll call Amy that just rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nShe kept asking me questions about Ethiopia, about the civil war, culture, etc. And every time I\u2019d had to tell her that I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m not from there but I\u2019m willing to talk about Romania. At which point she would seem uniterested.\n\nNear the end of the party, my brother came back and as he entered the door he said something which caused issues: \u201cHei Negru!!!\u201d\n\nMaybe he should have been more tactful, but he was really excited, after closing a deal.\n\nWell, some people where schocked. Needless to say they misunderstood it for the n word. But i think they also realized this was my brother, because i told them ahead of time he\u2019ll come back at some point. \n\nAmy took it on another level tho. She started actually yelling at my brother for using the n word. Asking who he is? How dare he use that word? Etc.\n\nWell here\u2019s were I might be an asshole. I lost my  cool. She was already irritating with her questions about Ethiopia so when i saw her yelling. \n\nI shouted at her to shut her insensitive mouth the f*ck up. That if she had bothered to talk to me about my actual heritage other than the place i was born she\u2019d have known that is my name and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. And told her she is welcome to take her leave early if she things my own name is offensive.\n\nAfter everyone left, my gf said she understands why i got angry but I was still a bit of an ahole for not considering Amy\u2019s pov.", "created_utc": 1694367331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f68zz/aita_for_calling_my_gfs_friend_culturally/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re right, had she actually taken the time to get to know you she would\u2019ve realized how off base she was. Black people dont need others to jump up and defend us. Allyship is not being the loudest voice in the room, it\u2019s yielding the floor so the most important voice at the time has the ability to speak. She was out of line and owes you an apology.\n\nIn regards to your girlfriend, idk if it\u2019s an interracial relationship, but I\u2019m mixed black and have found that my white partners always need some type of conversation afterwards to explain my reaction to out of pocket comments. You were in YOUR HOME. You have an expectation of respect within the four walls of the home you invited others into. This is a teachable moment for your girlfriend and a moment of note in your relationship. Pay attention to how she either stands up for you or asks you to apologize to smooth things over for her sake. \n\nBlessings on you.", "[removed]", "NTA How ironic that she doesn\u2019t register how she was being offensive but jumped at the chance to call out someone else without know the situation.

NTA.", "NTA, and very ironic that she doesn\u2019t realize how racist she was being when she kept questioning you about Ethiopia even after you told her you\u2019re not from there. Your gf is wrong too, and I\u2019m side-eyeing her for not backing you up when her friend was being such an asshole. You shouldn\u2019t have to consider Amy\u2019s pov because Amy\u2019s pov on your identity is irrelevant.", "NTA. Amy was TA for being so insensitive about you in particular. She didn't care about you as a person, and I get the feeling she only saw you as an ethnic curiosity she could champion for and earn brownie points when playing \"white savior\".\n\nI might jump the gun here, but I also get the feeling that Amy's POV would include expressions like \"internalized white s\\*premacy\" and buzzwords like that, directed at you.\n\nYou reacted as any normal person would.", "Amy seems so cringe. While yelling at her may have been a bit much, she was the one who wouldn't stop asking you about Ethiopia, a country you haven't even seen since you were an infant. You even flat-out told her you were raised in Romania and would be happy to talk about Romania, but she insisted on talking about Ethiopia. And sure, maybe mishearing the name \"Negru\" is an honest mistake, but she took it upon herself to yell at someone who was a guest in your house, someone who was comfortable enough to let himself into your home and address you with familiarity. \r  \n\r  \nLike...
