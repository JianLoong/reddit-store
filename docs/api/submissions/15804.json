{"id": 15804, "submission_id": "130elu9", "title": "AITA for telling my roommates to keep it down when having sex?", "selftext": "I live with 2 other girls who have both been terrible housemates. Neither of them ever clean anything, and the house is left as a total pigsty unless I clean it up. They\u2019ve caused the sink to clog multiple times, refuse to throw out the trash even when it\u2019s about to be bursting, leave food out to rot and mold, and so on. I\u2019ve tried telling them to clean up, made a cleaning schedule etc, but it\u2019s never worked out in the long run. Since I\u2019m the only one who the apartment manager talks to as a point of communication, I\u2019m also the one who has to relay the news to tell them to be quiet, stop slamming doors, just overall not fun stuff. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m seen as the \u201chigh-strung\u201d roommate, since I\u2019ve been the one almost constantly telling them to clean up, before eventually giving up. \n\nOne of my roommates is really loud, whereas I\u2019m a really quiet person in general. She\u2019s always humming or singing or on the phone, which I don\u2019t mind. However, she\u2019s been bringing a guy over to her room and having REALLY LOUD sex for the past few weeks. I can hear the moaning, the slapping, the bed slamming against the wall, etc. I\u2019m moving out soon so I tried to suck it up, but I also have really bad insomnia and it makes it harder to sleep when I have to hear this going on late at night. \n\nI couldn\u2019t take it anymore and texted her separately, asking her if she could possibly keep it down next time she brought a guest over. I tried to word it as nicely as possible. \n\nShe\u2019s been cold and hasn\u2019t responded to the text. I\u2019m worried if I should\u2019ve just sucked it up because there\u2019s not much time left on the lease, and I don\u2019t want to end on a truly awful note. Plus, every other month or so, my boyfriend stays over for a few days, and we try our best to be really quiet when we have sex (close to silent, really). My past housemate who lived in the unit with me commented about how she never knew if I had guests over (because I was so quiet) unless she saw us out in the dining room eating or something. \n\nI\u2019ve never had any roommates say anything, but now I\u2019m worried that just never said anything and sucked it up. \n\nSo, AITA for not sucking it up and calling her out, when I could also potentially have been loud in bed?", "created_utc": 1682585415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130elu9/aita_for_telling_my_roommates_to_keep_it_down/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem super tolerant, parenting roommates doesn\u2019t seem like an easy task. Your current roommates will be in for a rude awakening when they sign a lease with others less accommodating and patient as you. They may not realize it now, but you\u2019re doing them a favor letting them know what behaviors are unbecoming in a housemate. I hope your next move affords you all of the luxuries you deserve. \n\nIn college, my friend from middle school and I shared a dorm. Both beds lofted, end of mine feet from head of hers. Her, now husband, would stay over in her bed. I assumed they were doing things in the dark, because 19 year olds, but never heard a peep, a fart, a moan, a giggle, nothing. I respected them a lot for that.", "NTA at all.\n\nUnless they want you to join in - and they should ask - there is no need for that", "NTA - Buy her a ballgag or something but there is a point that if they that loud then it will become a problem", "NTA. Let her be cold. Her actions are deeply inconsiderate in shared living quarters. She\u2019s just embarrassed you called her out.", "NTA\nRecord it & blast it through the house", "NTA. It's common knowledge that when in a living situation with roommates you should be as quiet and respectful as possible. I'm surprised you lasted that long without saying anything honestly.", "Nta", "NTA, and if she'll be loud next time, tell her that if you want to hear moaning, you would rather look at specific websites", "NTA - I think I'd be looking for somewhere else to live", "NTA. Seriously does she think anyone wants to hear her in your apartment??? You shouldn't have even had to ask. Move out as soon as you can and forget about them.

Seriously, it's so cringy (on top of being disruptive) when someone decides to advertise to the entire floor what they're up to.)", "Amateur, record their sex sounds and make money from it via the Innernerd.", "NTA putl all their trash in their room everytime. Sign it with their names. Let everyone who comes in see how messy they are. Blast porn when she is loud.\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. And better than telling them to keep it up.", "NTA", "You seem anxious about whether or not you've properly interpreted social cues. From what you've shared, you're doing fine.\n\nBeds loudly hitting the wall during sex are a no-no in shared housing environments. So is being verbally loud during sex. You would be entirely within your rights to ask your roommate to move the bed farther away from the wall and to try to be quieter overall.\n\nIf your roommate can't handle that request gracefully, she shouldn't live with roommates, because she'll be challenging for anyone to live with. \n\nYou, by contrast, have tried to be polite and considerate many different ways.

I suggest recording it and making it your ringtone for her number. Then tell her to call you so she can hear it. This should bring it home to how loud she is being."]}
