{"id": 2744, "submission_id": "yzn91z", "title": "AITA for yelling at my SIL and making her cry when she kept offering me her milk?", "selftext": "I (27F) have lupus. For those who don't know, it's a chronic auto-immune condition, it causes a variety of symptoms. For me, one of my many symptoms is that I have very stubborn red rashes on my face, arms and chest. From an outsider's perspective they just look like really severe acne. I'm quite self-conscious about them but I try not to let my skin stop me from wearing what I want or being in photos.\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, my parents held a family dinner.\n\nMy brother (30M) has a wife, Kat (29F). Over the years, Kat has become your stereotypical crunchy Pinterest mom. I don't dislike Kat as a person but this situation has gotten me very angry at her.\n\nSo at the dinner, the conversation topic turns to babies and children. Kat starts talking about how she's so glad she can make \"liquid gold\" (breastmilk) and starts talking about how she puts leftover breastmilk milk in her body lotion and it got rid of her stretch marks, and goes on about how it's a magical cure for everything.\n\nIn the middle of her talking, Kat starts making really uncomfortable eye contact with me and I can see she keeps looking at my rashes. Kat points at the rashes on my face and says to everyone that she'll \"offer\" me some of her breastmilk to get rid of my \"acne\".\n\nI told Kat it's not acne and asked her to please stop talking about it. For context, I didn't start having symptoms until my early 20s and my family is still skeptical about my diagnosis and thinks there's nothing wrong with me, so no one else defended me.\n\nKat wouldn't drop it and told me I have nothing to be ashamed of and to just take her breastmilk and to \"trust the process\". I politely declined and said that I'm pretty sure her breastmilk won't make it better, and I'm sure she can find a better use for it.\n\nKat still wouldn't let it go and went on and on about this miracle cure and how powerful it is and how it'll \"restore\" my skin and started blabbering about some woman on Instagram curing her eczema with breastmilk. I lost my temper. I told her to piss off and that her bodily fluids aren't going to cure my autoimmune disease, and told her to keep her damn milk to herself.\n\nKat starting yelling at me and called me an ungrateful bitch, then started crying and my brother took her into another room and comforted her. My parents were really mad and told me to leave and said I need to learn how to be nice and act like an adult.", "created_utc": 1668895041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzn91z/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sil_and_making_her_cry/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one presents symptoms such as yours without accompanying emotional issues.   How it's possible that anyone could subject you to the abuse you get is horrifying to me.   Lupus is a serious medical condition for which there is no cure.", "NTA\n\nYou politely declined a very rude and annoying offer and she pushed. Honestly, your family sucks.", "NTA - Regardless of you having lupus, and the absolutely ridiculous treatment option your sister-in-law tried to force on you, you don't just out of the blue offer someone else your breastmilk to use on their body. That just gross and so beyond boundary breaking. Your family sucks too. I would consider going low contact, because I strongly suspect the stress of your family not believing your diagnosis is making your condition/symptoms worse.", "NTA\n\nNotify your parents that Kat is the one that needs to behave like an adult and listen when you tell her \"no\" the first time.\n\nShe was completely out of line to keep pushing you.", "NTA. If breastmilk cured lupus, then a hell of a lot less people would have it. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. Take solace in knowing you are NOT wrong.", "NTA\nShe seems very overbearing. It seems kind of creepy to me even though I have heard of it. And I breast fed my baby. But she was the only one to get it lol. \n\nI have something wrong with me health wise. I was pouring over symptoms and Lupus. Then I realized the main symptom seems to be the rashes and I don\u2019t have that. My biggest problem is my blood pressure going way too high or way too low. \n\nShe has a lot of audacity to assume she\u2019s smarter than doctors and that she\u2019s doing you a favor. She obviously thinks highly of herself", "NTA. Who the hell would point at someone's skin in front of everyone at a family dinner and announce that they can cure it? That's such weird, saviour complex behaviour.\n\nKat needs to learn how to take a no.", "NTA \\~ You asked her politely, repeatedly, to stop. I probably would have lost my temper after awhile, as well. The only thing you may have done differently was walk out?  \n\n\nWhile I understand that many people use breastmilk for many things, I still find it gross that she won't take no for answer. I wonder if your parents would feel the same about other bodily fluids?", "NTA. She offered, you declined (twice) and she kept pushing it. Chances are she pushed it because she wanted you to fawn over how her \"liquid gold\" cured your rashes and she could boast about it for crunchy points online.", "Your family is weird", "NTA - but it sounds like your entire family doesn't believe in science. Good time to shed the unneeded weight.", "NTA\n\nThat's disgusting. \n\nJust... \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e", "NTA you did nothing wrong", "As someone who has had lupus for 40 years, this is horseshit. Breastmilk is not a freaking cure all. NTA and if you can I would go NC with the lot of them", "NTA. \n\nDude, your entire family sucks.", "NTA.  It's the same crap as when people tell you they can cure something with essential oils or supplements.  It's BS.  Her world must be pretty small, if she really thinks her breast milk is a cure-all.", "NTA. \n\nYou asked her to drop it multiple times. She was the one being rude.", "NTA - print an article on lupus mail it to those people.  Really it sounds like they care more about Kat than you.", "NTA. As someone who also as an autoimmune disease (celiac) I don\u2019t blame you for getting upset with her. Just as you know it won\u2019t cure it, I know that other things won\u2019t cure my celiac disease. She had no right to continue to push it onto you. Also I\u2019m really sorry that your family is skeptical about your lupus. I hope you can find a solid support system &/or that your family can take you seriously (as they should)", "NTA.  You were nice, polite, and you handled that situation with frankly more grace than it really deserved.  \n\nA. It wouldn't matter if her doctor had prescribed her a cure for lupus that she was willing to share with you, the moment you said no thank you that should have been the end of the story.  She's not your doctor, she's not you, she needs to mind her own business.\n\nB.  When niceness didn't work, you tried again.  When that didn't work, you escalated it.  That's exactly how you handle pushy people.  \n\nC.  Your family sucks for not believing you about lupus.  It's not exactly some sort of strange, exotic disease that only a few people have, I've met three people with it in the last 9 months.  \n\nD.  GAG A MAGGOT.  Seriously, \"hey, rub my boob juice on your skin.\"  Gross.  The fact that she had the gall to be offended by you declining makes it, inexplicably, worse.", "NTA\nYou declined politely.", "NTA. She was incredibly rude to you.", "NTA you could have been nicer but you said no and she kept pushing. It was a kind offer initially but when you made it clear you weren\u2019t interested she should have stopped. She could always sell it or donate it. It\u2019s pricey.\nAlso, your family sucks for not believing lupus and should respect you.", "NTA\n\nShe pushed too far on what she barely knows about, but responding with in a violent way isnt the way. i wouldve waited it out until she stopped blabbering and wouldve not maken a scene, but its understandable to get impatent", "NTA that\u2019s creepy as fuck.", "NTA. You were polite and asked her to stop and she continued to push it. She fucked around and then she found out. Unfortunately people don't understand lupus and either think it isn't real, think it isn't serious, or think that they somehow know how to fix it. It's frustrating as hell for people to either think you're being overdramatic and there's nothing wrong with you, or if they do believe you to try and offer some bullshit advice on what they think you should do when they have no understanding of what you're going through.", "NTA while breastmilk is amazing and does many things even outside just providing nutrients for a child, she should not have been so pushy, insensitive, and dramatic when you said no.", "NTA and I am sorry your SIL treated you that way. She was completely in the wrong to bring that up at all, let alone at a family dinner. Even worse that she wouldn\u2019t take no as an answer. Your family really should have had your back, they are also in the wrong for not. I would recommend putting some distance between you guys for a bit and think about whether or not these relationships are worth the stress. I wish you the best!", "NTA\n\nIn any normal family offering your breast milk to anyone other than the kid you're feeding is well out of line.\n\nThat she continued to press after you declined is not OK.\n\nHowever, I don't think it was super necessary to jump to swearing that quickly. I get why you did but a firm \"I've said no and I'm not discussing this further.\" Might have been worth a try before telling her to piss off.\n\nAlso your family sucks for not having your back here, even taking into account their scepticism of your lupus, the breast milk thing is weird and intrusive enough that they should know you're not in the wrong. They also suck for being sceptical of your disability.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was trying to help but shouldn't have pushed it. You were rude in your response.

Lupus causes rashes because of the immune system attacking healthy skin cells.", "NTA . Of course she was rude in her response, she said no 3 times and the woman still wouldn't shut up. After rather first no she should have left it. And her family should have stood up for her too. I'm sure if breast milk helped people with rashes caused by auto immune disease then doctors would be giving that as advice.", "I mean if SIL has so much milk spare that she can offer to make it into products for other people maybe it's time to reduce supply?\n\nIf she doesn't have spare milk she shouldn't be offering it to people nor her kid.", "Like I said I get why she said piss off. I do because that would be my first instinct.\n\nHowever this is someone she'll need to interact with for the foreseeable future, a family member and happened at a family event and ostensibly SIL was \"trying to help\". I put that in quotation marks because I doubt the offer came from an altruistic place but that's how witnesses to the event would have seen it. \n\nI'd have tried to exhaust my diplomatic options first before getting more aggressive with my \"hell no, under no circumstances\" response."]}
