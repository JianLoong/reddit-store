Over the years, Kat has become your stereotypical crunchy Pinterest mom.

Kat starts talking about how she's so glad she can make \"liquid gold\" (breastmilk) and starts talking about how she puts leftover breastmilk milk in her body lotion and it got rid of her stretch marks, and goes on about how it's a magical cure for everything.\n\nIn the middle of her talking, Kat starts making really uncomfortable eye contact with me and I can see she keeps looking at my rashes. Kat points at the rashes on my face and says to everyone that she'll \"offer\" me some of her breastmilk to get rid of my \"acne\".\n\nI told Kat it's not acne and asked her to please stop talking about it. For context, I didn't start having symptoms until my early 20s and my family is still skeptical about my diagnosis and thinks there's nothing wrong with me, so no one else defended me.\n\nKat wouldn't drop it and told me I have nothing to be ashamed of and to just take her breastmilk and to \"trust the process\". I politely declined and said that I'm pretty sure her breastmilk won't make it better, and I'm sure she can find a better use for it.\n\nKat still wouldn't let it go and went on and on about this miracle cure and how powerful it is and how it'll \"restore\" my skin and started blabbering about some woman on Instagram curing her eczema with breastmilk. I lost my temper. I told her to piss off and that her bodily fluids aren't going to cure my autoimmune disease, and told her to keep her damn milk to herself.\n\nKat starting yelling at me and called me an ungrateful bitch, then started crying and my brother took her into another room and comforted her.

After rather first no she should have left it. And her family should have stood up for her too.

You were kicked out by YOUR parents for trying to get her to drop it?! Your parents and brothers are aholes for not telling her to can it and let it be after the 2nd time she insisted. \n\nTHIS IS RIDICULOUS!! To equate breast milk with a cure for lupus is to believe crystals heal cancer\u2026 effin insane and you need to create some boundaries bc this shit will only get worse and HOW DARE THEY!?!?!

You\u2019ll need to avoid the lot of them for a while. I have no skin issues and NO WAY would I put breast milk on my skin \ud83e\udd22", "NTA.  I also have an autoimmune condition (crohn's disease) and people can be very ignorant yet pushy about this. Because they can't see autoimmune conditions the way they see other disabilities they fail to show empathy towards it. Nobody would offer someone in a wheelchair to cure themselves with a brisk walk, but I've been suggested \"cures\" that are just as ridiculous. People offered me to do some bullshit diets that made their digestion better, because they can't see inside the body and don't understand that crohn's isn't some stomach bug. A friend of mine also suggested I should try camel milk to cure my crohn's (camel milk is available in my country but is not regulated and thus full of camel shit). Your SIL is just as ignorant about your condition, and so are your other family members if they don't believe your diagnosis. \n\nThe dynamic you're describing is also very familiar to me. It's the unhelpful dumbass who thinks they're being helpful. Last year I was suffering from an esophageal stricture (esophagus was too narrow to swallow food). My sister decided she wants to \"help\" by telling me to do acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. I declined,  and from that moment on her way of \"helping\" was to pressure me to do this. I explained that these things are nonsense and she told me that's okay because placebo effects exist and she went to a witch once to cast a spell which got rid of her headaches. I told her this was a serious situation that could not be treated by placebo but she kept going because in her mind she was offering me a solution and me rejecting it was the reason I'm not cured. Paradoxically,  her being fully focused on \"helping\" me this way made her lose any empathy towards me and blame me for being ill. When I told her I'm not wasting my money on this after paying so much in medical bills she said she'll pay for this. And when I got mad and angrily told her I didn't sleep a full night in weeks because of the pain and I'm not going to spend the little energy I have on this nonsense she sarcastically said \"at least you still have enough energy to be angry\". A couple of weeks later I went through a procedure that made things better. It was done by an actual doctor,  not a witch.\n\nYour SIL subscribes to the same school of thought as my sister.  She doesn't know anything about your condition,  so she mistakenly compared it to some light skin rash rather than a serious disability. She suggested a ridiculous solution, but rather than accept your knowledge about your body she tried to \"help\" you by pushing her wrong ideas on you. When you politely declined, she disrespected your boundaries and continued pushing. When you finally snapped she lost all empathy,  blaming you for being \"ungrateful\" rather than accepting that her suggestion was bad, and making this about her and her feelings.  It's most unfortunate that your family is backing her on this, but they're very wrong. What she did is incredibly rude and hurtful. I would communicate to your brother that you expect her to apologize for not respecting your boundaries and being rude and ignorant about your condition.
