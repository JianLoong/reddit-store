I told her to use a portion of her money to get new lights. She could easily get some but she complains that she doesn't want to spend that much.

She says that I am lucky because I'm never without money and I just said \"that's because I don't spend as much.\" I had an emergency early in the year that costed A LOT of money and I was able to just dip into the savings and handle it without a lifestyle change.

Charting out gas price fluctuations over time versus your time lost, I honestly doubt you are saving any money and you are losing time and putting yourself at risk of being stranded if your vehicle runs out of gas due to an unforeseen road stoppage or detour occurring.
