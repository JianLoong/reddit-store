As a grown man, you are relying on your parents in an attempt to save money/build credit for your personal future.  Your sister is also relying on your parents, but is a bit younger and it is more appropriate though she too should grow up.

The ideal scenario is OP fills up his tank whenever the price of gas dips, and tracks himself where his tank is filled up to whenever he finishes using it.

I'm sure she'll learn", "NTA.\n\nAt first I was like, ok, you're not the asshole, but you don't really save money by only filling your tank up for that day's trip. You pay for the gas when you use it, regardless of how much you do or don't put in your tank at the time. Whatever reduced efficiency you get by carrying around an extra 10 gallons of heavy liquid is surely worth not having to stop at the gas station, potentially wait for a pump, and then get out of your cozy warm car and mess with your credit card and a bunch of cold metal things every day.\n\nBut then I got to the part about your sister using your car, and now I see how limiting the gas you put in the car is saving you money, since she can't use gas that isn't there. (Smart!) Of course, you'd save more money if you refused to let her use your car at all (and then maybe filled the tank full), but maybe you're just more of a generous person than I am. \n\nRegardless, you aren't running a free car service for your sister.

First time I declined the $1,200 work to ground something and said I would be picking it up in an hour. Miraculously when I got there it was repaired for the $70 they charge as a diagnostic fee. I suspect the mechanic repaired it in about 10 minutes but the sales folks wanted to hit a quota. And they weren\u2019t quite brave enough to undo the work because when I took it somewhere else the true difficulty of the repair was bound to come out.\n\nYears later I tried taking my car into the dealership for a nonfunctional charging port which I figured was a blown fuse. They quoted me $250 if that truly was the problem. I looked up a few videos, went to the auto part store and fixed it myself for $8 in less than an hour. \n\nYouTube is your friend.
