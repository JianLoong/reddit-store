You can do whatever you want in this regard and owe no one any explanations.", "He's not threatening to \"disappear\" is he? Just a question. It seems like he's just trying to get some extra feelings from you by using coersion and guilt. He is living with his GF currently. He is not with you. Also he has \"hurt\" you a lot but you \"somehow you still care for him a lot\". Your words. Get away from him immediately.", "NTA - baby momma would be the obvious first choice if he were gone, grandparents on both sides would be next followed by siblings.\nWhy on earth would he think a self proclaimed child free ex would want to be responsible for his child?", "NTA\n\nDude is a walking red flag \ud83d\udea9", "NTA - The kid is not your son. The baby has a mother.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend's question was hypothetical, and it seems as if he sought some form of emotional assurance rather than an actual commitment. You made an honest response.\n\nYou are allowed to set boundaries with your friend, especially considering the fact that he's your ex-boyfriend as well. You have made your stance about not having children very clear, which is commendable. Taking care of a young child is a significant financial, practical, and emotional responsibility-it's nothing to sneeze at.\n\nAlso, nag him again about your living situation. It may help your case.", "Your hypothetical is so far outside the realm of reality, it\u2019s not even worth getting worked up over.

It\u2019s not even a reasonable question. The child would go to the mother if anything happened to him.", "Some people aren't the type to have children, it's your choice!  NTA.", "NTA. Taking on someone's kid is a huge responsibility. If he thinks you're a bad person for saying no, he does not care about his kids' future. You need to pick someone who you know will be a good guardian, who can provide them everything they will need in life.\n\nI have a 6yo and me and my husband have had to pick someone incase the worse happens.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation here at all. He's an AH.", "NTA. That's not something you drop on another person for your own comfort.

You need to get the fuck away from this walking red flag.", "So\u2026 does your \u2018unique connection\u2019 tell you this scrub of a dude wants to cheat on his baby-mama with you  and as insurance when you get caught, he\u2019s making sure you\u2019ll take on his parental duties so he can disappear? Cos that\u2019s what it sounds like. \n\nNTA, but y-t-a to yourself if you continue to hang out with this \u2018friend\u2019.", "NTA, its a nice sentiment that someone sees you as being the best capable of bringing up their child in the event of their death. Though its not your responsibility to do so. \nIf you dont think thats something you could do then they just need to find someone else. Not your problem in the slightest and your definitely within your right to refuse.", "\"Unique connection\" aka trauma bonding lol", "Am I the only one seeing the obvious 'unique connection' is affair partners?\n\nShe has known him for almost a year, with a 3 month relationship within that year.

Run like hell.", "NTA but you should cut ties.", "I'm sure everyone is saying this, but you don't need this \"friend\" in your life. Friends don't hurt each other.  NTA the kid question is goofy.

You dont have to provide further explanations. A no is a full answer.\n\nEdit to add: he seems like a \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 walking.

Maybe he is thinking about it) letting his child to you, you will call CPS and not keep the kid.", "NTA", "He\u2019s a foo", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t want children of your own\u2026 it\u2019s not your responsibility to look after this guys child.

So the kid already exists - it\u2019s good that he\u2019s thinking about this all because so many parents don\u2019t. Many people are dangerously optimistic and think that nothing will happen to them, then might and the kid suffers. With that, he has no place to be upset over someone not wanting to take on the monumental task and associated time and financial burdens that come with raising a child. He should seek out someone else who is willing and have a solid plan in place. \n\nLike others have touched on, it almost sounds like he wants to take off and not have the guilt of leaving behind a child without someone to raise them. I sure hope that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on.\n\nIt\u2019s weird that he\u2019s asking you when the baby has a mother who is alive.", "Lol the unique connection line took me out.

It\u2019s disrespectful to his family and honestly, pretty low in respect for yourself as well.", "This hypothetical is his way of getting you to accept his kid and him to be a real relationship with you. Honestly you need to drop him, no amount of \u201cbonding\u201d will change the fact that he wants you to be a mother figure for his kid", "NTA\n\nWhy do people ask questions when they don\u2019t want to hear the answer? \n\nMy mom asked me the same thing once when we were barely speaking and I hate her husband\u2026 if I would take on my half brothers who were like 20 years younger than me. My step father has like 9 siblings and my mom has like 3 siblings\u2026. And she asked me when we don\u2019t even like each other \u2026\u2026.. then was fucking shocked when I said HELL NO.", "NTA you answered truthfully. He will have to find another guardian for his child if he is worried about or planning to have everything of himself vanish except his son.", "Anybody who is flipping shit like this over a hypothetical is being shady as fuck.
