Your wife expressed that you had been ignoring her\n2. Your response to this was to send her away to live in an empty house by herself\n3. You ignored her all week\n4. And you justify this by saying SHE needs space? You were doing this FOR HER?\n\nNo, YOU wanted space. And you're so immature and messed up that you can't even admit it to yourself! Your selfish behavior here has made your wife feel awful, humiliated, and disrespected. Not to mention you could have put her in danger because she was sick and pregnant.\n\nYou are a completely self-absorbed AH and it doesn't seem like you respect your wife or care about what she wants at all. YTA. I feel bad for your wife that she's stuck having a kid with you.", "Holy shit YTA\n\nThis woman is going to be the mother of your child and your answer to being in conflict with her was to ask her to leave.\n\nDon't do this again.  Next time she might not come back.", "YTA. You did not let her go to the other house for her good but because you rather spend your time working than care about your wife. She was just a nuisance to you. You not checking up on her proves that. Prioritizing your work over your wife work never looks good, you'll have some major making up to do.", "So\u2026let me see if I have this right.\n\nYour wife was depressed because her parents moved.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make time to help her because of work.\n\nYou were fighting a lot (and how you found time to fight when you had no time to be loving and supportive is beyond me), so you kicked her out to go live in an empty house.\n\nHow you could have written all of this out without realizing that YTA is amazing.", "*Last month her both parents moved to live with her brothers in Australia and she's been feeling very down since then.*\n\nSo she felt down and instead of understanding you couldn't be bothered which lead to petty fights.\n\n*It started to get really suffocating and frustrating for both of us so I asked her if for a few days, she can go live at her parents house.*\n\nShe felt down, and instead of being there for her, you sent her away. To her parents house, so she can be even more confronted with the fact that they moved far away...  And you did this solely for YOUR convenience.\n\n*I only wanted her to have some time alone to clear her head.*\n\nDid she ask for it, or are you trying to excuse your behaviour?\n\n*I assumed*\n\nThere you go. YOU assumed\n\nYou basically turned your back on her and sent her away when she needed you most. AND it turned out she was sick, AND also pregnant.\n\nWhy should she contact you for not feeling well when you showed that you didn't really care about her.\n\nYou just wanted some time without her.  *and have some time alone for myself*\n\nDon't say her being sent away by you was for her benefit as well, because you NEVER asked what she wanted, or how she felt. You just ASSUMED. A total lack of communication.\n\nIf I was her, I'd stay in my parents house. Wouldn't think of coming back to you. Or better, move to Australia to be with my family and have the support I'd need with my pregnancy and raising a child.\n\nYes, YTA", "Info: Did you just tell her to get out and stay at her parents or did you communicate your concerns and her potential need for space?", "YTA - so your wife is lonely and down because she misses her family.  You've been neglecting her and fully acknowledge that you aren't giving her the attention she deserves.  She brings this up to you and tries to talk to you about how she's feeling, which leads to arguments.  And your solution to all of this is to....  ask her to move out for a while??  Really?  I mean, re-read that.  How on earth can you even think that you're not the asshole here?", "YTA big time OP. \n\n\"I'm definitely at fault for not making enough time for her these past few weeks due to excessive workload\"\n\nSo you know the reason why OP. What a crass way for being dismissive to your partner like good lord. Try finding ways to communicate your workload and strike a healthier worklife balance.", "YTA. You didn't do this to help her. You did this for yourself. She needed you to be there. She needed emotional support. But you were happy to ignore her so you could have the house all to yourself. Your wife was sick and alone and you ignored her. Now she knows how selfish you are. I bet when your kid gets too much for you you'll kick them out and ignore them too. Shame on you for being such a selfish spouse.", "OOF why'd you assume that she needs \"alone time\" to clear her head when she's homesick and missing her favourite people?\n\nI feel like you prioritised giving yourself some time alone rather than supporting your wife when she needed you. \n\nYTA. So disappointing.", "YTA - yes of course you are the reason. Rather than spend time with her you sent her away and then ignored her because she was annoying you.", "YTA. You told her to go live somewhere else because she was bothering you, then were surprised she didn't reach out because she didn't want to both you. What the fuck.", "YTA\n\nSo, your wife is lonely and sad for a good reason, and is also somewhat ill.\n\nYou admit that you have been neglecting her and not supporting her during a difficult time.\n\nInstead of correcting that, you send her away from her home.\n\nWhen you fail to get in contact with her, instead of going to check on her you let her be alone for a WEEK.\n\nDid she SAY she wanted to be alone and \u201cclear her head?\u201d Or were you just sick of being around her?\n\nYou neglected your wife repeatedly to the point that she didnt even want to tell you she was sick because she thought you wouldnt be there for her.\n\nYou should be on your hands and knees begging forgiveness. Shame on you. YTA", "YTA with so many red flags streaming behind you she'd be better off to move to Australia.", "OMG! What did I just read?\n\n* Your wife's parent's whom she is close with just moved away.\n* You have been working long hours so have not been able to spend much time with her.\n* Your response is to ship her to her parent's ABANDONED HOME! Because you thought she needed SPACE!\n\nYou sent your wife packing like an unwanted pest! And you wonder WHY she didn't return your calls?\n\nOf COURSE you are the reason she is being reserved! She is pregnant by a person who treats her worse than most people would treat their pets! \n\nYTA!!!", "Let this sink in:\n\nYour wife was sick for days. So sick that she was on leave from work. \"When I asked her why she didn't inform me, she said **she did not want to bother me.**\"\n\nRead that again carefully! You are so dismissive of her needs that she is afraid to tell you that she is seriously ill because she doesn't want to bother you!\n\nYTA! Either change your priorities or get a divorce and set up coparenting because she deserves someone better than you. A lot better than you!", "YTA  \n1. You were arguing  \n2. You asked her to leave  \n3. You then ignored her for an extended time???  \n4. How the fuck did you think she would act?  \n5. Dude you're lucky she is even there  \n6. She's probably checking out what's involved in moving to Australia right now  \n7. How can people be this tone deaf  \n8. WOW", "YTA\n\nWhy on earth didn't you just talk to her in the first place?\n\nShe needed your support but instead you basically threw her out and then hardly even bothered to check to see if she was alright.", "This makes me so sick. Yes YTA for kicking out your sick and pregnant wife and not communicating why. I feel sorry for her that she came back and I hope she doesn't next time", "YTA. I don't know why you would even post this question. \n\nI suspect the next time we hear from you, you'll want to know if you're AH for refusing to pay child support because she has free housing at her parent's old house.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you kicked her out of your home. Obviously you both need to learn to communicate better because things will only get more difficult with a baby.", "Sorry, but YTA. You placed your relationship's problems completely on your wife and kicked her out.\n\n'Time alone to clear your head' is dude nonsense to avoid processing emotions -- your wife is not a dude.   \n\nIf your spouse was down about her parents leaving, then she needs more understanding and caring on your part. Instead you just sent her away. \n\nI get it. Dealing with someone else's emotions is frustrating and scary, but it can also be rewarding once you learn how each other work. You really need to consider marriage counseling to help you both work on communication and expressing your needs. Parenting a child will only exacerbates your relationship problems.  \n\nBusy at work is real, but family always takes priority. If work becomes your priority, then you need to budget alimony and child support into your compensation.", "YTA. She could not possibly have taken this any other way than that you were kicking her out.\n\nShe must have felt so rejected, when she was already going through the loss of having close family living nearby. I can't even imagine how isolated she must feel now.\n\n\"Now she is back home but unusually reserved and I feel like I am the reason.\" You are. You are the reason. You may not have intended to hurt her but you sure didn't try very hard not to.\n\nI know what it's like to feel like you have no-one in your corner, despite being married. I honestly just want to give her a hug.\n\nYou might not be able to come back from this, OP. If I were you I'd offer to get to therapy ASAP to learn how better to show empathy to the one you're supposed to love.", "YTA. I'm surprised she came back", "Is this a repost? I\u2019m certain I voted on this story within the last few weeks. \n\nYTA then. Still an AH.", "YTA, why would someone who is feeling down because they are separated from their family also want to be separated from their partner. That makes absolutely no sense.", "YTA, it\u2019s so pitiful, I feel so sorry for her, I can\u2019t imagine how trapped she feels.", "Info: how did your wife being lonely and neglected become a need for space in your head?", "Jfc yes YTA. \n\nyou didn't offer her emotional support when her family left. Fine, work commitments came at a bad time and that's kind of forgivable. But then when it was obvious she was upset, you tell her to go away because you *assumed* she needed space. During a time where she undoubtedly feels more alone because her family isn't there? No wonder she didn't feel like she could bother you when she was sick when your reaction to her not being ok was to send her away. \n\nSeriously OP. You got a hell of a lot of groveling to do to fix this.", "YTA.\n\nWife: \u201chey you\u2019re not spending enough time with me\u201d\n\nOP: \u201clet me send you to your parents house to live alone for a week\u201d", "YTA - you abandoned your wife when she needed you the most. You made massive assumptions and it didn\u2019t seem to occur to you to ask her what she needed. All you wanted was her out of your hair so you could focus on work. You managed to make her feel like such a burden that she didn\u2019t even feel able to tell you she was sick. YTA", "wow dude. Don\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s on the next flight to Australia. If i was going through an extremely difficult time and my partner essentially kicked me out of the house because he assumed and didn\u2019t clarify that \u201cI\u201d needed space instead of him???? You abandoned your wife. You abandoned the mother of your future child. I\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t already have divorce papers on the way. Take some time to take a good hard look at yourself and realize that you\u2019ve been an awful husband and if you want to make it right you are going to have to make the choice every day to do so, if she\u2019ll even have you after you kicked her out of her own home and refused to elaborate because you expected her to read your mind. This was just straight up cruel and callous behavior. Both of you need couples counseling immediately. YTA 1000%. Do better.", "YTA. Not gonna comment on this hornet's nest of a situation", "YTA 1000%", "What in \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" kind of story is this? Holy shit YTA", "INFO: how long has she been away? What has your communication been with her since you \u201csent her away\u201d? \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards YTA because you don\u2019t have the right to ask her to leave just because that\u2019s more convenient to you than dealing with her feelings. She\u2019s obviously upset and lonely about her family, and then you send her away? She has literally become sick (jaundice) from stress and sadness.", "YTA\n\n\nYou sent your wife away instead of addressing the problems. You didn't want to \"give her space\", you wanted to be left alone.", "My wife's essentially lost her family since they now live on the opposite side of the world. Her being sad is a bummer for me so I told her to move out. Now I think she's mad at me coz I didn't bother checking if she was alright. Turns out she's got a liver disease too OOPS LOL. Can you guys tell me I'm a good dude tho coz my ego needs it\n\nETA: YTA dude. Colossal. The posts been up an hour and I've already seen it on Am I The Devil.", "YTA, though I don't think you intended to be. \n\nLike objectively, your wife was going through a difficult time with her parents moving away. That may not effect everyone that way, but obviously she was bothered. \n\nI think you got frustrated as any human can and told your wife to go somewhere else. You messed up in not checking in a bit more often or reaching out to discuss the disagreement after a day for emotions to die down a bit. \n\nI can't speak to the frequency that you all contacted each other that week, since a phone works both ways on that front. But I can see how your wife would be more hesitant to bring up concerns or talk with you. The last time she did, you sent her away and (intentional or not) ignored her until she had gotten sick enough to warrant doctor intervention. \n\nI just don't think as a husband you were being very supportive.", "YTA, Why don't you ask your wife how she feels? She communicated her needs and you asked her to move out. How are you confused? She's now pregnant with the child of a man who ignores her and she doesn't have her family around for support now.", ">I'm definitely at fault for not making enough time for her\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My intention was to .. have some time alone for myself\n\nYTA YTA YTA", "YTA. Your wife was feeling sad and lonely because her whole family moved away, and you thought the best thing for her was to tell her to get out? You abandoned her at a low point in her life. Dude, really? Of course you're TA. I'm sure she's evaluating whether the relationship is even worth it.", "YTA for making her leave YALLS home, not just yours. If you need space, get a hotel room for a few days and YOU leave. Go see a counselor or something, jesus. I\n\nNTA for working so much, you work for a living, noone can be at fault for working too much. This mentality needs to stop, people can't always control how much they work.\n\nESH all around", "NTA\n\nShe said she wants some space. You gave it to her. But I do think your relationship is damaged. She is sick, and didn't call you. You need to have heart to heart. Take care if her. Make sure she knows you care for her.\n\nEdit: YTA. I missed the part where you tell her to go to her parents house.", "NAH. Just be there now. Sometimes when faced with folks acting beyond norm, its because something unusual is going on.
