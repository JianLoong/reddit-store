He threw a little fit, and demanded his parents also give him cookies. After that, he made an enemy of my son.\n\nHe would steal my daughters dolls. He would tear up our flowers. It came to a point where we had to install a lock on my gate to keep him out of our things.\n\nThe day this incident happened, the kid had climbed over our fence to get into our yard and wreak havoc. My daughter was playing in the yard, so I went out there to tell him to get lost. When I came outside, he started cussing me out. you wouldn\u2019t believe the language this kid was using.

Where did this cookie incident happen? How did you witness this kid throwing a fit about not getting cookies and then complaining about it to their parents. A 4yo old holding a grudge and \"making an enemy\" out of another kid is just super sketchy. I worked in kindergarten, kids that age don't work like this. How did the kid get to your daughter's dolls? And most importantly of all: Where are his parents in all of this?", "LOL What? This kid is on the loose, climbing fences, stealing and destroying things? Call child services.

NTA.", "ESH \n\n\nYou are right to scream about controlling this behavior. But it was misdirected. This kid is FOUR. And his parents see nothing wrong with him just climbing the fence and destroying your garden?\n\n\nHave you addressed the behavior with the parents at all, and what have they said? Because your first course of action should not be screaming at the kid.", "Soft YTA. Your frustration is understandable, but yeah, at that age, you should have really been yelling at his parents since they are the ones who apparently let him wander off on his own at 4 (!!!!) to get into other people's yards. Seriously, what's going on in that house? Such behavior doesn't start out of nowhere. You might consider calling CPS on the parents.", "NTA. You're not the little monster's parent, but you sure as heck can yell at him if he's on your property. Tell his parents you'll be calling the cops or CPS every damn time he trespasses on your yard or bothers your kids. 4 year-olds need to be under their parents' watchful eyes all the time, not roaming around vandalizing.", "These situations are super awkward but you need to have a chat with the parents to lay down some boundaries but first things first:\n\napologize to the 4 year old. Because you are the adult here and again, the kid is 4. \n\nYTA", "Yep, don\u2019t scream at other peoples\u2019 kids. It\u2019s not ok.\n\nThere are other ways to handle these situations.\n\nApologize for the screaming. Do it with grace. And then avoid them like the plague.\n\nYTA, sorry", "NTA since this was not a one time incident and you have tried talking to the parents. Still, the kid is 4. And you\u2019re an adult. Offer an apology for losing your temper. But tell the parents their kid is banned from your house and yard.", "NTA his parents need to control their child", "YTA but i understand why you did it.  Scream at his parents, ultimately this is their doing.", "NTA - trespassing? Come on. This kid and his folks suck.", "YTA for yelling at a 4 year old. You're the adult so act like it and go apologize for yelling at this child.", "YTA \n\nHe is four! His parents are the problem yell at them. How would you feel if someone screamed at your daughter? Call CPS if you feel it\u2019s needed you are an adult deal with it like an adult\u2026\u2026..", "YTA. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge deal, but a grown adult should never yell at a child that young, especially one who is not in their direct care.", "Even if a child is as ill-behaved as this little one seems to be, he is still a CHILD. If the parents refuse to help you, call the police and get them involved.  If the parents are not supervising his behavior and he is running around without parental oversight, there are other agencies that can help.  \n\nIt sounds like he is not being taught how to behave, but for yelling at a 4 year old...... YTA.", "Info: why did you feel it\u2019s appropriate to yell at a small child who is a new human being and doesn\u2019t understand how to properly regulate himself instead of at the adults who are failing to properly parent their child? \n\nThe kid acts this way for a reason, take it up with the full grown adults who are responsible for him. If the parents are truly that horrible of parents, should you not call CPS? A child acting out this way isn\u2019t doing it for no reason, something is likely going on at home. \n\nYTA", "ESH. But I think neighbours letting their kid act awful is more TA than losing your temper after a lot of provocation", "ASH (Adults Suck Here) you suck for yelling at a 4 yo and his parents suck for letting his behavior continue.", "ESH. Instead of having a yelling match with a 4 year old, you could've just taken him home and had the choice words with his parents. But they also need to take accountability for their kid's behavior.", "ESH- yeah yelling wasn't the best way but so what if the parents wont talk to you, they let this little beastie run wild and bully other kids.  He is 4yo and running around with them not having a clue where he is and what he is doing.", "ESH. Your neighbors suck for not disciplining their child and letting him run loose in other people\u2019s backyards. The behavior you\u2019re describing imo warrants professional help as it\u2019s very aggressive and inappropriate for a 4 year old. You suck for yelling at a 4 year old child who clearly doesn\u2019t have an adult in his life teaching him right from wrong. Cussing you out was wrong but he is 4 and you\u2019re an adult.", "Apologize to the parent and the child. And also set boundaries. He isn't to come climbing over fences when gates are locked, if he wants cookies ask an adult, things like that. Stealing toys is pretty typical but it bothers me that it took them a week to get your daughter's dolls back. ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It took years for his parents to get a diagnosis and the proper medications/behavioral corrections started.", "> A 4yo old holding a grudge and \"making an enemy\" out of another kid is just super sketchy.

A kid climbing a fence and making a mess is not a sign of abuse or neglect, in the legal sense. At worst, it's poor parenting, which is NOT in the purview of CPS. \n\nThere are SO many kids who are truly abused and neglected who need help, and calling CPS for something like this siphons resources away from those who desperately need it.", "This may have been an \"in the moment thing,\" but what was OP doing after all the other incidents?", "I think the reason why I lost my temper was because there were other factors going on that day, some personal stuff with work, and my temper was just generally very short.", "Looking back, I feel extremely guilty about how I acted. My wife is reaching out to the family tonight to see if they wanna talk about what happened, so we'll see how things go with that.", "The ability to be angry or mean is not the same as holding a grudge and \"making an enemy\" as OP describes it. It's quite abstract for a 4yo to translate envy over not getting cookies into hating another child. Emotional responses are very immediate at that age and the boy didn't attack OP's son, but ran to his parents. So unless OP's son beat the other boy for trying to steal cookies I don't see how this would happen and even then it's not exactly normal for a child that age to categorically terrorize said child, their sister and whole household.", "Again. Not the same as \"holding a grudge and making an enemy\". That kids is destroying property at 4. Let me break it down to an evolutionary level: Kids are wired to survive and their survival depends on adults at that age. Sneaking out and getting strange adults angry by fucking up their property and harassing their kids is not exactly beneficial for survival.", "So he just took the dolls, ran off and you...? What happened then? Again: Have you confronted his parents?", "I think the commenter is assuming that the four year old is able to do these things because they're unsupervised. It seems unlikely that the parents are watching the child climb the fence and destroy the landscaping. I'm not sure where you're located but in my area an unsupervised four year old roaming the neighborhood is an issue for cps.", "you\u2019re right. my wife and i had a couple convos about the right course of action, but we ultimately decided to leave punishments up to the parents as it isn\u2019t our kid. looking back, the parents are for sure not taking care of that kid properly so a cps call is coming", ">I don't see how this would happen and even then it's not exactly normal\n\nIt's almost like kids are all different and have different functional levels.", "> Kids are wired to survive and their survival depends on adults at that age. Sneaking out and getting strange adults angry by fucking up their property and harassing their kids is not exactly beneficial for survival.\n\nThere are so many ways that kids can violate the principles you outlined, though. Neurodivergent kids are a big factor. There are absolutely children who don't actually care if adults are mad at them, even if they have been taught otherwise.", "That .... I mean, that's why they're cute and we as adults usually have the instinct to go awww. Kids don't have any biological instincts to not piss off adults, to my knowledge, which is admittedly lacking. \n\nKids tend to act out around trusted adults, because they know (or feel they know) those are trusted people where they can explore their boundaries. I've never heard anything about kids instinctively avoiding annoying adults.", "there have been a few conversations, but remember this has all taken place over a short time span, so we haven\u2019t been going as much into detail as we should. and i did speak to the parents after the doll incident, and they returned them after about a week.", "I don't think I was clear enough about this, but he doesn't just roam the neighbourhood. My wife and I are friends with his parents, so he comes over when they do. He doesn't just run around destroying things lol", "I suggest you be explicit with the parents. Because you yelled at their young child, you should apologize, but use the conversation as a chance to make your position clear - that he is not allowed to come onto your property and that you're expecting them to keep him away from you and your family because he is destructive, uses highly inappropriate language, and bullies others. I think this is a prudent step in between 'we decided to leave punishments up to them' and 'calling CPS'.\n\nYou can also instruct your children to come inside if he approaches while you're not present. Realizing I'm not living your life right now - and I don't envy you - I think as the authoritative adult in the situation you can enforce these boundaries without having to call authorities. I don't consider the kids' behavior a sign that he is being abused or neglected, and thus, as of now, this is not a matter for CPS.", "Punishment for what? Were they aware of all the stuff he was doing? Like, standing there watching him and you didn't say anything? Or not in sight at all? Were they there when he climbed the fence....or did you make a point of waiting until the parents weren't around before screaming at him?\n\n\nDo you think he went home and said \"by the way, I destroyed Girl's dolls today\"? \n\n\nYou say you wanted to \"leave punishment up to the parents,\" but never actually talked to the parents. Maybe they are completely ignoring him. Maybe they are acting in a way he's mirroring. Maybe he's in multiple forms of therapy and psychiatric evaluations and trials of medication and the parents are trying to figure it out.", "What do you mean by \"short time span\"? I don't get what that even has to do with anything or why you would need to get \"into detail\". The kid stole your daughters dolls. Give back the dolls and stop letting your kid run around the neighbourhood wreaking havoc. What details more do you need to talk about with his parents? Although I am interested in what they had to say to that.\n\nI'm also confused as to why no one in your neighbourhood apparently bats an eye at this kids running around unsupervised at 4yo destroying gardens? Again. None of this is normal for a 4yo. Especially not in an enviroment where kids usually are rarely unsupervised.", "Sounds like they watch their kid as well as you watch your temper. \n\nYTA, be the adult, don't stoop to the level of a 4 year old.", "If his parents were over why did he have to climb a fence? Wouldn't he be inside the fence with them?", "It may have been a little unclear in the original post, but it's not like this kid is just running around the neighbourhood unsupervised. He's our next door neighbour, and he sometimes comes over to play. My wife is friends with his parents, so he comes over when they come over. Things weren't a real big deal until recently, when most of the drama happened, so we didn't see a need to take real action other then just mentioning his behavior to his parents.", "these were separate incidents.", "Was he outside unsupervised when you yelled at him?", "yes, but his parents weren\u2019t far", "So he was roaming the neighborhood unsupervised in this incident. In my area that would be a cps matter because he's only 4."]}
