A kid climbing a fence and making a mess is not a sign of abuse or neglect, in the legal sense.

Emotional responses are very immediate at that age and the boy didn't attack OP's son, but ran to his parents. So unless OP's son beat the other boy for trying to steal cookies I don't see how this would happen and even then it's not exactly normal for a child that age to categorically terrorize said child, their sister and whole household.", "Again. Not the same as \"holding a grudge and making an enemy\". That kids is destroying property at 4. Let me break it down to an evolutionary level: Kids are wired to survive and their survival depends on adults at that age.

What happened then? Again: Have you confronted his parents?", "I think the commenter is assuming that the four year old is able to do these things because they're unsupervised.

I mean, that's why they're cute and we as adults usually have the instinct to go awww. Kids don't have any biological instincts to not piss off adults, to my knowledge, which is admittedly lacking. \n\nKids tend to act out around trusted adults, because they know (or feel they know) those are trusted people where they can explore their boundaries.

My wife and I are friends with his parents, so he comes over when they do. He doesn't just run around destroying things lol", "I suggest you be explicit with the parents. Because you yelled at their young child, you should apologize, but use the conversation as a chance to make your position clear - that he is not allowed to come onto your property and that you're expecting them to keep him away from you and your family because he is destructive, uses highly inappropriate language, and bullies others. I think this is a prudent step in between 'we decided to leave punishments up to them' and 'calling CPS'.\n\nYou can also instruct your children to come inside if he approaches while you're not present. Realizing I'm not living your life right now - and I don't envy you - I think as the authoritative adult in the situation you can enforce these boundaries without having to call authorities. I don't consider the kids' behavior a sign that he is being abused or neglected, and thus, as of now, this is not a matter for CPS.", "Punishment for what? Were they aware of all the stuff he was doing? Like, standing there watching him and you didn't say anything? Or not in sight at all? Were they there when he climbed the fence....or did you make a point of waiting until the parents weren't around before screaming at him?\n\n\nDo you think he went home and said \"by the way, I destroyed Girl's dolls today\"? \n\n\nYou say you wanted to \"leave punishment up to the parents,\" but never actually talked to the parents.

I don't get what that even has to do with anything or why you would need to get \"into detail\". The kid stole your daughters dolls. Give back the dolls and stop letting your kid run around the neighbourhood wreaking havoc. What details more do you need to talk about with his parents? Although I am interested in what they had to say to that.\n\nI'm also confused as to why no one in your neighbourhood apparently bats an eye at this kids running around unsupervised at 4yo destroying gardens?

You admit your wife invites them over.  That is the problem.  He comes with his parents and then does this stuff.  Stop inviting them over.  If your wife wants to see them, do it at their house.  Don't yell at toddlers unless they are in immediate danger.  Example:  toddler running into street, then it is okay to yell as you run to stop them, \"stop right there!\"  If the kid is actively destroying your yard.  You are bigger and can pick him up and remove him from the situation or make the parents come do it.

Be proactive and get the letter sent.\n\nYou did lose control with a little kid, but I honestly can\u2019t blame you.  Just know going further, that kids like this enjoy getting a rise out of people and now he\u2019s received all this attention for crying, he\u2019s probably going to ramp it up.  Stay calm. Be cold.  Remain emotionally detached.  Tell him to go home and if he doesn\u2019t, call the parents and tell them you\u2019ll call the police if he keeps harassing your kids.  Follow through.
