A kid climbing a fence and making a mess is not a sign of abuse or neglect, in the legal sense.

Emotional responses are very immediate at that age and the boy didn't attack OP's son, but ran to his parents. So unless OP's son beat the other boy for trying to steal cookies I don't see how this would happen and even then it's not exactly normal for a child that age to categorically terrorize said child, their sister and whole household.", "Again. Not the same as \"holding a grudge and making an enemy\". That kids is destroying property at 4.

What happened then? Again: Have you confronted his parents?", "I think the commenter is assuming that the four year old is able to do these things because they're unsupervised.

I mean, that's why they're cute and we as adults usually have the instinct to go awww. Kids don't have any biological instincts to not piss off adults, to my knowledge, which is admittedly lacking. \n\nKids tend to act out around trusted adults, because they know (or feel they know) those are trusted people where they can explore their boundaries.

My wife and I are friends with his parents, so he comes over when they do. He doesn't just run around destroying things lol", "I suggest you be explicit with the parents. Because you yelled at their young child, you should apologize, but use the conversation as a chance to make your position clear - that he is not allowed to come onto your property and that you're expecting them to keep him away from you and your family because he is destructive, uses highly inappropriate language, and bullies others. I think this is a prudent step in between 'we decided to leave punishments up to them' and 'calling CPS'.\n\nYou can also instruct your children to come inside if he approaches while you're not present. Realizing I'm not living your life right now - and I don't envy you - I think as the authoritative adult in the situation you can enforce these boundaries without having to call authorities. I don't consider the kids' behavior a sign that he is being abused or neglected, and thus, as of now, this is not a matter for CPS.", "Punishment for what? Were they aware of all the stuff he was doing? Like, standing there watching him and you didn't say anything? Or not in sight at all? Were they there when he climbed the fence....or did you make a point of waiting until the parents weren't around before screaming at him?\n\n\nDo you think he went home and said \"by the way, I destroyed Girl's dolls today\"? \n\n\nYou say you wanted to \"leave punishment up to the parents,\" but never actually talked to the parents.

I don't get what that even has to do with anything or why you would need to get \"into detail\". The kid stole your daughters dolls. Give back the dolls and stop letting your kid run around the neighbourhood wreaking havoc. What details more do you need to talk about with his parents? Although I am interested in what they had to say to that.\n\nI'm also confused as to why no one in your neighbourhood apparently bats an eye at this kids running around unsupervised at 4yo destroying gardens?

Don't yell at toddlers unless they are in immediate danger.  Example:  toddler running into street, then it is okay to yell as you run to stop them, \"stop right there!\"  If the kid is actively destroying your yard.  You are bigger and can pick him up and remove him from the situation or make the parents come do it.

Be proactive and get the letter sent.\n\nYou did lose control with a little kid, but I honestly can\u2019t blame you.  Just know going further, that kids like this enjoy getting a rise out of people and now he\u2019s received all this attention for crying, he\u2019s probably going to ramp it up.  Stay calm. Be cold.  Remain emotionally detached.  Tell him to go home and if he doesn\u2019t, call the parents and tell them you\u2019ll call the police if he keeps harassing your kids.  Follow through.

You're better off with them not talking to you and the kid staying the fuck away from yours.", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t scream at kids \n\nYou have the upper hand, by not being 4 years old.\nReturn the child and tell the parents he\u2019s not welcome on your property \n\nIf he has behavioural issues screaming at him won\u2019t help", "YTA.  I understand you must have been very angry. But it's a 4 year old.  They are pretty easy to outsmart.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to have a controversial take here, but that kid needs to be disciplined, and if his parents aren't doing it you have to be clear he isn't welcome. Obviously only because he's fucking with your kids and invading your property, otherwise you should just leave him alone. But yeah, the kid is jumping into your yard and cussing at you? That's a \"listen here you little shit\" kind of situation given that the parents have failed hardcore raising the kid and he's hasn't been invited.\n\nI'm always surprised at how much bad advice is given when other people's kids are involved. Obviously you dont want to go crazy, but clearly telling a misbehaving and unsupervised child, who is forcing himself onto your property and cussing at you, not to do something and making sure they understand it is completely acceptable in a lot of circumstances.", "You don't cuss out a child, you tell the parents and if the behavior doesn't change, you cuss out the parents because they are allowing the behavior, and tell them you don't want him climbing your fence. It's locked for a reason. I have no filter and the truth just comes out but perhaps you should use a filter and present it in an almost nice way. After if the gate is locked and he falls and gets hurt, it protects you and your family.", "Um yes. YTA. There's never a justification for yelling at a 4 year old, unless it is to keep them or someone else from getting hurt. Do I have children? Yes. Have I yelled at them before? Yes. But it's not okay. Like I said, unless of course it was to keep them from imminent danger.", "You should've directed your anger at the parents. At any point, did you try to talk to the parents at all? That's weird. YTA.", "He\u2019s fucking 4 of course YTA", "I\u2019d like more details. There is info missing.  But on the positive that kid won\u2019t bother you anymore - hopefully.", "YTA. Yelling at a 4 yr old is not the answer. You should be having a discussion with the parents or maybe even CPS but being verbally abusive towards a child that isn\u2019t even yours isn\u2019t the answer no matter what the issue is.", "I am seriously besides myself that people are saying OP is NTA. You're frustrations are understandable but does NOT make it okay to yell at a toddler. Like it's not the end of the world. I don't think OP is a bad person or should burn in hell for this mistake, but yes, he's definitely TA in this situation.", "NTA, the kids parents should deal with the kid, starting with keeping and eye on him.", "I'm going to go with YTA. Yeah, the kid sounds like an unholy terror, but you are a grown ass adult.", "Now you know why the house was such a \u201cgood deal.\u201d \n\nNTA. I would have done far worse for the kid to have climbed my fence in the first place. Never apologize and stand your ground. I do worry for your kids though. Moving or keeping them out of the same school when the inevitable comes will save you and your children a lot of hell. This kid is bad news.", "I have serious doubts about this story. I know a 4 year old that's rough and mean when playing with my kids and I have to supervise and intervene, but I wouldn't call it \"bullying\". If the kid has behavioural issues, then the parents should be aware or should be made aware. Why haven't you spoken to them? Why were they not watching him? And to cuss out a 4 year old? That's pretty fucked up. It's not as if a four year old is able to cause so much damage as to warrant that sort of reaction from a friggin ADULT. YTA.", "That neighbors kid is a menace he is a bod boyoioioi. (thank you for you consideration) #leapfrog", "YTA\n\nHe\u2019s a 4 year old, you are an adult.", "ESH. Never go off like that on a child! Not to say it isn't sometimes deserved, but there is no way in hell that someone your age and size can ever explain  that in a way that doesn't make you a complete asshole. You always need to play it VERY safe with other people's kids. No one cares about your side of the story, you'll just be some evil abusive guy.\n\nHis parents are the obvious course of action. They're the ones you need to handle that kid. And of course it goes both ways, so make sure you communicate to your kids that you don't want them trying to talk to or play with that kid anymore.", "ESH\n\nThat brat's parents need to discipline their son better definitely.\n\nYou owe the brat an apology for yelling at him, but at the same time, his parents need to understand the reason you yelled was because of how awful their child is and that is their fault.", "Going against the grain here but YTA. Hes a 4 year old. You can't control your temper against a 4 yr old and you have similar age kids? Thats sus. \n\nYou're the freaking adult here right? Go talk to the other adults, who are this kids parents. \n\nReddit in general has a hate boner for kids, so you'll find a lot of people on your side here, but he's 4, you're how old?", "My 4yo nephew held a grudge for almost a year because his grandfather ate his cake we said he could have after dinner.  He didnt speak to or acknowledge him at all that whole time. That's a quarter of his life. Kids can certainly hold a gridge", "Incorrect, you are 100% wrong, some kids are indeed just like this and sometimes worse. Try not to make blanket assumptions and make yourself look foolish", "I have news for you: I taught pre K for 7 years, there absolutrly are young kids like this.", "Ok Trunchbull!", "It\u2019s a made-up story, obviously.", "4 year olds are braggarts and liars and lovers of gross things like boogers and poop.   I love them, most of the time , but they can be tough to deal with.", "Yelling is abusive.  Full stop.", "Take a chill pill. No need to get insulting about it. SMH.\n\nI have simply never met a 4-year-old who would act this way. It's perplexing to me that a kid would act like ET hosts judging a red carpet event. I have two kids, for your information. And been around a lot of young kids and never seen any of them act that way. And as rusalkkamaya mentioned, 4 year olds generally do not have the emotional capabilities at this stage to \"hold a grudge for 2 weeks\". So yes, I find it strange. Your experience isn't universal. People are allowed to find things strange. You don't have to act so personally insulted by it.  \n\n\nETA - And don't put words in my mouth. I never called your child strange. I just thought it was a strange reaction for a 4-year-old. I was wondering if maybe you had a certain career or something that would've precipitated this kind of reaction (like you're in fashion or something). Or maybe you watch fashion shows around them. No need to get your feathers ruffled.", "I guess I've just never met a 4-year-old who would react that way. As rusalkamaya mentioned, their emotional reactions are usually immediate. As in \"that kid stole my ball\". But then five minutes later they're playing together again.", "Even children who are abused or neglected tend to react in a different way than OP is describing.  As a child of two child psychiatrists and a teacher myself what I can say is this child IS definitely bring neglected but OP seems to be (as most adults do) misconstruing common  \"this child is never being watched\" behavior for \"this child is out to get my family\" behavior.  It's the house next door, so this is the easiest place for this kid to wander, and you know what four year olds do when they aren't being watched? Destroy shit.  Not because they are being vindictive, necessarily, but bc they are still learning about the world and don't know how things work.  They don't know how to pick flowers or what is or is not appropriate behavior unless they are taught, and it seems the only thing this kid learns is swear words. \n\n I don't know where you live OP or if children running the streets is normal where you are from but YTA for not calling CPS the first time this kid wandered onto your property with no parent in sight. The kid is 4. He should have someone watching him at all times.", "You wrote \u201cIt came to a point where we had to install a lock on my gate to keep him out of our things.\u201d \n\nWhy would you need to do that if he is coming over with his parents? You also say this has taken place over a \u201cshort time span,\u201d but you needed to install a gate lock to keep him out?\n\nbut if he is coming with his parents, then what does the gate lock achieve? Unless he is running around unsupervised.  And if he is supervised and with his parents, why did the parents let him destroy your garden?   \n\n\nThis all screams fake, made up story. If it is real, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Don\u2019t befriend neighbors who have a kid that terrorizes you or your children. Be a parent and protect your kids. Don\u2019t yell at a four year old, what is the point, you are an adult. You choose whether or not that kid and his parents are invited over. right? Unless he IS unsupervised And sneaking on your property.", "You are blaming a 4 year old for his parents' bad parenting.  Children behave this way because they are ALLOWED to behave this way.  YTA for being mad at a child when it's obviously the patents.  Grow some balls and have an adult conversation with them.", "Oh no, you aren\u2019t uno-reversing me. It came off as insulting. Perhaps you didn\u2019t mean it that way, but the word \u201cstrange\u201d has negative connotations. When you say the man down the street is \u201cstrange\u201d, you don\u2019t mean quirky or unusual.", "He forgot to write character motivations and dialogue for his wife and the kids\u2019 parents, I guess. Apparently the neighbors just sit by and smile while their kid messes up the garden, breaks into things, and steals dolls\u2026and his wife likes it I guess? And that is why she invites these neighbors over. Idk.  There are so many holes in this story.", "You are both wrong it's miss the forest through the trees.", "ESH.", "Kid jumps the fence and doesn't listen to instruction. You losing your shit at a little kid? YTA. Get it together man. You have a range of tools accessible to you as an adult to handle a 4yo. Next time yell at the parents", "ESH. You don't scream at him, you simply be *extremely* verbally firm while physically removing him from your home. Scream at the parents, then call CPS because there's a very high chance this behavior is a result of some serious stuff going down behind their closed doors", "NTA. Normally I would say you were wrong to yell at a 4 year old and make him cry.  But this kid and his parents need a reality check.  With any luck, his parents will keep him away from your home and family, and he\u2019s so young he won\u2019t remember why, he\u2019ll just remember he doesn\u2019t want to mess with you.", "Yeah. This info is pertinent.", "Apologize and build a better fence.", "The kid literally climbed over OP\u2019s fence to reach OP\u2019s daughter.
