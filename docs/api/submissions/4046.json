Just that you wouldn't go if he did.", "NTA.  It's ok to not want to be around someone You did not say no he couldn't come you said I can't be there if he is. That is what is called a boundary. Quite a healthy one at that. It seems as if you have no problems with any of the other members of your family having a relationship with him as long as you don't have to be around it. Maybe for the aunt that is upset explain that to her.", "NTA. If your father cared about family he would try to make ammends with you.", "Your aunt made the choice not to invite him. You didn\u2019t force her to. You are blessed to have family who loves you as much as they do to consider your feelings. Reading so many AITA posts where people have toxic family members who take the side of the asshole in the situation for the sake of keeping the peace and not having to take a side leads me to believe that this is hard to come by.\n\nYou relayed your feelings and your aunt decided your feelings are more important than catering to your dad\u2019s demands.

Your family stopped speaking to him because of how badly they hurt you. If your father wanted to fix things, you are the first one he should have offered an apology to.

Screw that second aunt and your dad.", "NTA-he wants the family to meet his \u201cnew\u201d son as if he doesn\u2019t already have one he\u2019s abandoned.\n\nTell nosy that that if she wants to be in touch with your crappy sperm donor, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA you were honest with your Aunt and it was her choice who to invite, she wanted you there more than your dad and his new family. Your other Aunt is more than welcome to visit with your father either in her home or at his. Seems she is advocating for him where others are on your side. Your family is who you choose to have in it. Your father will regret the day he cast you aside. The best revenge is a life well lived, live your life well and to the fullest.

Obviously \"dad\" is TA, because imo no parent chooses someone else over their kid.", "NTA !!\n\nKicking you out when you had nowhere to go and no money to get somewhere, because his new wife couldnt be the adult and get along with you is a truly AHole thing to do.\n\nHe doesnt get to just 'return to the family' because he now wants all the benefits that entails for his new son.\n\nAdditionally, you didnt tell him that HE couldnt go, you were very respectful to your Aunt and just said that if he was there you wouldnt be. Completely understandable.\n\nIMHO until he apologizes to YOU and makes things right with YOU (and asks if YOU are ok with him and his wife and son coming) then he doesnt need to be there.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt chose not to invite him after considering your feelings.

However, with that being said, is there any way that you and your Dad can talk this out and try to have a relationship?
