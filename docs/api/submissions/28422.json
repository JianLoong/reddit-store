It's none of her business what you do with your body. But it sounds like she was only trying to say you were fine as you are. For you to come back with such a vicious (albeit funny) insult was beyond over the top.

Maybe you would be the asshole if you keep taking digs at her, but a one off? No way.", "NTA. Until you get your boobs lopped off due to cancer, you cannot push your opinion on anyone. It\u2019s a very personal decision. I\u2019ve lived it. Given the cancer, insurance should cover the implants. Unless you have a different scenario.

But glad you're OK now.\n\nBut it's not like this is something you just sprung on everyone. It's something you and your husband discussed and seemingly agreed to if you were budgeting already. Her point is moot (and, as you said, hypocritical). Yeah, he fell in love with you as an <A-cup, but I'm sure *the reason* he loves you goes far beyond what size bra you buy. I mean, just because I wore a certain makeup style when my partner and I first started dating doesn't mean I wore it forever, and he still loves me with my new styles and no makeup at all. I mean, makeup \u2260 breasts, but you get what I mean. Our physical looks at *always* changing, it's inevitable.\n\nI mean, what if you were well-endowed and your mastectomy took you down to an A? What would your MIL be saying about that? If you were well-endowed and decided NOT to get implants to take you back up to your original size, would she be criticizing you for that and pressuring you to get one?\n\nIt's your body, only you can decide what to do with it.

I have generally always hated that sometimes people notice my breasts, let alone the rare occasion when someone  feels free to comment on them. Good grief.\n\nI only mention it because larger or smaller mammaries aren't *anyone's* actual business but yours. Its taken me years to get past people's projections about my breasts. The head trip some people want to give you about your body is just a mind blower sometimes. (And I have no idea why the North American culture seems so breast obsessed in the first place? But, what I do know is that YOUR breasts are only YOUR business. Breasts are like ears to me - they just hang around harming no one. And yet, no one remarks on our ears?)\n\nNTA.
