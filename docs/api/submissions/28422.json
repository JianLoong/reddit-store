If quite a bit are you comfortable that people might comment on it? I'm not at all saying they'd be right to do so, and I imagine the people close to you will know your reasons anyway, but just be aware that some people, like your MIL, will think you are vain. I hope you don't let other people's opinions affect your decision, and after breast cancer you certainly deserve to feel comfortable in your own body, but for some people this might be something that they hadn't thought about and would concern them, so just mentioning it.\n\nOn a similar theme, will your clothes still fit? It obviously depends on what size clothes you wear, and tbh you might want a new wardrobe anyway, but something to consider.\n\nAlso, and this I genuinely don't know and am curious: would having implants affect future screening for breast cancer recurrence? \n\nAs a side note, it seems like you're relatively young, so having breast cancer at your age is unusual.
