I'll accept my judgement.\n\nI(29F) Have been married to my husband \"Neil\"(29m) for two years. Very early on in the relationship we both shared the same strong opinion that we never wanted children. Neil did admit to me that he had a child but because he never wants kids he basically left his gf at the time when she wanted to keep it. I didn't care. Fast forward to now, his son is 4 and his mom went to jail, and her parents are old and not well enough to raise a kid, so they reached out to Neil. He came home the other day from work announcing news, he's taking in his son and finally being a dad to him. I was livid, because he made that decision without so much as a conversation with me and not having any children was a very big agreement when we were dating and got married. Also, he works away from home while I work remote, so he was expecting me to be mommy throughout the day, to which I said hello no. We've been fighting about this since, but he's expecting to take his kid here in a few weeks. I told him if he is dead serious on doing this then I will be dead serious on moving out and divorcing him, but now he and his side of the family are calling me an AH for rejecting this kid, some of my family members took his side too.\n\nI get why I look like an AH and probably a total bitch, but I never wanted a child nor did I want to raise one, and while I know it sounds awful I think I have the right to not be put in this position to be a parent when I have made it very fucking clear all throughout my life that I would never step into a parental figure. I'm curious to hear what you all say, but tbh I do not think I will change my stance on this conflict either way.\n\n**Edit: Wow, I'm surprised...this is not how I thought this was going to down at all. I do appreciate every comment, regardless of judgement. You've all helped me decide that I need to leave this marriage asap. Neil has every right to be a parent to his child but I need to get out because this is simply not the life I wanted.** ", "created_utc": 1669776387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8ev0x/aita_for_making_my_husband_choose_between_me_or/", "score": 472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When there's a kid, it's always a possibility that the parent will need to care for the kid.\n\nStill, having a child free family was what you and your husband agreed on.

As my dad would say - that horse has already left the stable.

I don\u2019t mean he should have married the girlfriend but he should have supported and helped raise the child. Which means you would not have married him, and hey, maybe his ex wouldn\u2019t be in jail.\n\nI don\u2019t see a positive outcome in this situation.

Double AH points for *knowing* you don't want kids and expecting you to look after his anyway. I can't help but notice he didn't try to change his *own* work to look after his *own* kid, just assumed that you'd do it for him.\n\nHe's absolutely the bigger AH here, by far.

But I do have a problem with you being ok with the fact that he has been a dead beat dad for 4 years and this poor kids mom is in jail.

If your husband has decided to step up, then you may have to step out.  I know this isn't what you want to hear, but he is responsible for his child, no matter what the circumstances were before now.

I'll accept my judgement.\n\nI(29F) Have been married to my husband \"Neil\"(29m) for two years. Very early on in the relationship we both shared the same strong opinion that we never wanted children. Neil did admit to me that he had a child but because he never wants kids he basically left his gf at the time when she wanted to keep it. I didn't care. Fast forward to now, his son is 4 and his mom went to jail, and her parents are old and not well enough to raise a kid, so they reached out to Neil. He came home the other day from work announcing news, he's taking in his son and finally being a dad to him. I was livid, because he made that decision without so much as a conversation with me and not having any children was a very big agreement when we were dating and got married. Also, he works away from home while I work remote, so he was expecting me to be mommy throughout the day, to which I said hello no. We've been fighting about this since, but he's expecting to take his kid here in a few weeks. I told him if he is dead serious on doing this then I will be dead serious on moving out and divorcing him, but now he and his side of the family are calling me an AH for rejecting this kid, some of my family members took his side too. \n\nI get why I look like an AH and probably a total bitch, but I never wanted a child nor did I want to raise one, and while I know it sounds awful I think I have the right to not be put in this position to be a parent when I have made it very fucking clear all throughout my life that I would never step into a parental figure. I'm curious to hear what you all say, but tbh I do not think I will change my stance on this conflict either way.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s a shitty thing for your husband to do as a person and the fact that you\u2019re cool with it is also kinda lame. Your husband and in laws are AH because they both were cool with him not caring about his kid at all then all of a sudden want to be dad and grandparents of the year.. yeah they suck. I feel bad for the kid here - moms in jail, dad is probably not going to be great given that he\u2019s basically a stranger to this child, grandparents strangers and possible step mom wants nothing to do with him( not that I blame you for that again you have every right to not want a kid you made that clear form the beginning) but no one really truly wants this kid and he has nowhere to go.

This changes his life completely.  That you do not wish to deal with these changes doesn't make you a bad person, just an incompatible couple now.

A parent taking in their own child is not up for discussion.\n\nHaving kids is one of the few areas that does not have any middle ground. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to be placed in a parental role, but that means ending the relationship. Asking him to put his child into the system and be a deadbeat when he could raise the child is not reasonable. \n\nIf you're staunchly childfree why did you ever marry someone with a child? And someone that chose to abandon them!? Childfree is one thing, abandonment is completely different and does not reflect well on a person.", "NTA.

Looks like he jumped in in the heat of the moment. Her parents can\u2019t do it, what about his parents? Any chance of sharing the job?

Working from home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing nothing, and caring for a kid is certainly no doing nothing! You\u2019ve had a bad shock. Of course, things don\u2019t always work out the way we had planned and sometimes we have to suck it up. There are a number of adults in this scenario and one poor child. It\u2019s him I feel for. Your husband needs to get his head out of his backside and work this out, not just throw it at you and assume you\u2019ll just take on his responsibilities. How long will his mother be in jail?

There was ALWAYS going to be the possibility that something could happen to the mother or that he would change his mind and decide to be part of the child\u2019s life. You should have factored that into your decision to marry him (or not).

Now that OP\u2019s edit says she is going through with divorce I honestly wonder if Neil is gonna attempt to get out of this without someone to watch the kid while he works.", "Prince of your dreams lol \ud83d\ude02 yeah okay in what fairy tale (wasn\u2019t talking about op partner) \n\nlol calm down guys", "If husband knew he was taking on his kid due to the circumstances regardless then there is nothing to discuss with the wife. In fact any conversation would be artificial as his mind can\u2019t be changed. For me both husband and wife acted appropriately and this is a clear NAH.", "That is fair. Honestly it would have been one thing if the child eventually reached out when he was older(Like an adult, so we wouldn't have to raise him) and they decided to have a relationship but he's four now, meaning we would be full time parents all throughout school and shit, which is something I mentioned many times I would never do. \n\nBut thank you, these comments have made me realize he is allowed to make his choice, but I'll need to divorce him because I know I won't be happy in this situation and the kid deserves a happy environment and I know I can't provide that.", "I thought I was going to get torn to shreds because that's what everyone IRL is doing. SO in other words, everyone saying YTA", "U guys should go out for coffee after her divorce", "I mean, not really. The husband never intended to have anything to do with the kid. It\u2019s not like he sent the mom to jail in a scheme to spring the kid onto his wife. Life just happened and he\u2019s trying to step up and be a father. It just sucks because that\u2019s explicitly something OP and he discussed would not be happening.", "I agree either OP puts up with the circumstances life has thrown at them or she leaves. He created a child with his ex regardless of if he wanted kids or not.. there\u2019s preventative measures to help or he could\u2019ve gotten snipped.. and now the kids going to grow up parentless, because OP doesn\u2019t like/wnat kids lol Sorry but when you parent a child you no longer get to live selfishly and it seems OP isn\u2019t built for that", "Exactly. The way her husband talked about how he left his ex because he didn't want a child should have clued her in that he's garbage. Marrying someone who so clearly puts his own wants first was bound to end up in disaster.", "He\u2019s still a deadbeat but instead of dumping the entire financial burden on someone else\u2026he is dumping all the caretaking", "Seriously. When she said she didn\u2019t care at all that he just abandoned his pregnant ex gf. Like wtf?? Everyone\u2019s terrible here. Poor kid.", "I think when you decide to get married you have to accept all that comes with your partner. And that\u2019s all ESH FOR SURE", "It sounds like OP had a contingency plan \"if/when something happened to the child's mother\" -- break off the marriage. The risk of the child's mother becoming unable to care for the child long-term was not that high, maybe 5 to 15 percent? Is she TA for going into a marriage knowing there was a 5-15 pct failure risk for this reason?\n\n I dunno. Did she discuss with STBX in advance of the wedding?", "You\u2019re absolutely correct. This woman should leave. Not make the kid parent less. Poor child indeed.", "She\u2019s not an asshole for that. She\u2019s na\u00efve at best. The man is a deadbeat who hadn\u2019t been there for the child. In her mind, there was never going be an issue where he had (or wanted) to step up to the plate. She was sorely mistaken and the ex is a liar.", "And now this kid is likely to end up in foster care or some sht, she needs to divorce the man so he can be a dad to a child he pumped inside of someone", "In general you could argue ESH but he didn't even discuss it with her. That's a selfish power play, the kind of thing one must not do in a stable relationship. So one could also argue NTA.\n\nBut really, who cares? OP knows what they want, they clearly communicated that in the past and present, and there are no 100% positive solutions here. I dunno why they bothered posting.", "That argument is bullshit.  A partner COULD become a serial killer.  They COULD choose to become a drug addict.  They COULD decide to spend your entire emergency fund on fucking cookie jars.   He told her he wasn\u2019t planning on parenting.  That was the basis for the relationship. He lied.  She can do what she wants at this point and is under no obligation to raise or play mommy to his child at all.  She isn\u2019t at fault.  Full stop.", "She married a deadbeat lol marriage causes you to accept all things that come at you in life with your partner, and this is one of those curve balls she didn\u2019t see coming you either buckle down and take responsibility or leave. She has no right to say me or the kid lol", "What would be a middle ground between raising or not raising the child in your opinion? Lol", "Love has nothing to do with it, there is no such thing as a compromise when 1 person wants literally 0 kids because you can't have half of a kid.\n\nIf one partner wants 0 kids and the other wants 1 so you have 1 kid, that's not a compromise.", "How do you work out not wanting a child in your life, but having your spouse bring a child home? He wants her to do the bulk of the child care. It's not like she could refuse to have anything to do with the kid. This has to be everyone is 100% on board or they aren't together anymore.  Anything else just bad for the kid.", "And idk if you work remotely while you stay at home but balancing those two, when you didn\u2019t even want a kid to begin with, will be almost impossible.", "Husband is not an AH, he made a choice, his kid come first, there is nothing his wife could say to change his mind, so no conversation is needed, him and his wife just have to deal with the consequences of that. This is a clear NAH\n\nEdit: to the people who are downvoting me. A parent is perfectly entitled to decide that their child is the most important person in their life and to prioritize their child over other relationships, half of this Reddit is people who are messed up because their parents didn\u2019t prioritize them. So I\u2019m very happy to stand behind this and consider all of you A H", "Oh, the opposite! He did consider his wife. As free childcare at home, since she works remote. He just didn't consider her feelings, that's all..\n\nOP is NTA here, unbelievable, the audacity..", "Not to mention, a 4-year-old who is going be experiencing trauma from losing his mom to jail and now being put in a home with strangers.", "...and you were just okay with the fact that it meant nothing to him that he had a child?", "That in itself should have been a deal breaker. Not wanting them is fine. But if you make one and then refuse to support that child you are a trash human.", "YTA for not being bothered that he was a deadbeat dad.", "He\u2019ll just get another girlfriend.", "\u2026 did you read the comment? They weren\u2019t calling him a prince. They were advising Op to leave him.", ">But thank you, these comments have made me realize he is allowed to make his choice, but I'll need to divorce him because I know I won't be happy in this situation and the kid deserves a happy environment and I know I can't provide that.\n\nwow, OP. what a very mature and honest thing to say and realize. good for you.", "and you too are allowed to make your choice too just dont be hard on yourself.  i think for me what would have upset me the most is he made a major life decision without a thought of consulting you or discussing this first and allowing you to make the choice on your own and it tells me down the road he will continue to make decisions without a thought of what you think.  your marriage is supposed to me a partnership not a one man ship.  i hope everything works out for you the way you wish it to be", "NTA. \n\nThings didn\u2019t have to end up this way, but he thought this decision through about as much as he thought about the consequences of having unprotected sex with a future felon.", "Genuine question - Why were you okay with being with someone who is a deadbeat father... is that not a reflection of his character?", "Honestly for me it\u2019s ESH. Mostly him because he\u2019s a deadbeat dad who while finally kinda stepping up, isn\u2019t really as he\u2019s trying to put all the work on you. And that he didn\u2019t even discuss with you at all. I mean it\u2019s clear he knew what you would say since you did say hell no. But that doesn\u2019t mean he can just not talk to you\n\nYou\u2019re the ass because you were good with being a deadbeat dad. That speaks to the complete lack of integrity he has and you for being okay with that.\n\nThat all said it\u2019s by far the best for you to remove yourself from the situation. This guy is not a good person and keeps showing that through these large life decisions. Go find someone who will actually respect you and is also child free", "Ex is an A H for sure. However, marrying a man who is even a bad parent when you want to be child free, is an A H move. If it wasn\u2019t a situation like this. It would have been a child support order or something else. Man is a bigger A H but you can\u2019t marry a parent with the expectation that the human child will just never exist.", "She had every right to say \u201cme or the kid\u201d.  He told her \u201cthe kid\u201d wasn\u2019t part of their marriage.  Marriage doesn\u2019t \u201ccause you to accept all things\u201d.  I didn\u2019t \u201caccept\u201d my husband sleeping with the neighbor\u2019s wife when I was chronically ill.  She doesn\u2019t have to accept anything that she didn\u2019t sign up for.", "Agreed. This is one of those hard situations where middle ground is just not possible. There are no positive outcomes here.", "Are you saying that you are opposed to the child in your house at all or just the times you are working? Because I'm still thinking why are you asking us, your mind seems to be already made. Regardless of you being an asshole or not.", "I never said for it to \"work out\", it read like part of the issue was her caring for the child while working. I was simply asking if the issue was the child in the house or was the issue her watching child most of the time. If the problem is child in house than obviously it's her or the child. If it's caring for child most of the time then there is the possibility of different arrangements being made. \n\nThe same with whether or not she loves this man. If he's the love of her life or something close to that than they need to have more discussion. If she's to the point of nope, love is gone then she should just leave.  \n\nAll her info/comments point to she should just leave.", "OP would be on the fast track to getting fired.\n\nThere's no way she's watching a 4 year old and doing her job.", "No, he's definitely the asshole. Not for taking in his kid, I get that, but for voluntelling his wife to take on all the childcare duties all day for HIS CHILD who she didn't even agree to take while also working. That's what an asshole does.", "Foisting the child on her against her will and expecting her to become the primary care provider since she works from home AND encouraging his family to browbeat her into submission pushes him into AH territory.", "He IS t a h because he made a unilateral decision to thrust an unrelated child onto his wife without discussing it with her first.", "He is an asshole because he made the decision without his wife AND expected her to be a part of his decision. And when his wife said no, he got upset and went crying to his family who are now attacking her.", "Some people don't want kids but accidents happen.\n\nA woman can decide to terminate if she doesn't want to be a mom, but a father has no choice. He can never really fully terminate as he will likely be on the hook for child support for the next 18 years whether he wants the kid or not. \n\nIf a woman can choose to end a fetuses existence with no judgment then a man should be able to atleast refuse contact (but likely still pay support) without judgment. \n\nAnd to be perfectly clear. I believe in a woman's right to chose, but I also believe there should be a better way for men, it's just hard to find the balance between the father's rights and a child's right.", "If a man walks away in the beginning and pays support,  he's not a deadbeat. They dint get the choice to terminate so walking away (if support is paid) is a good choice.  Not everyone should be a parent and forcing people to be parents is a huge way to get an abused child.", "why would someone who didnt care about kids be bothered by that? it actually would be a trait that they were more likley to enjoy since it usualy mean they dont have to ever worry about the kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: for the ones arguing. I will be honest we dont even know if he didnt pay child support or anything and the info makes it sound like the two probaly were in agreement at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 3: could you guys stop blowing up my phone please. its getting anoying. big time when you all are saying the same shit. not gonna applogize for thinking that not everything is black and white here.", "I wasn\u2019t implying they were calling him a prince lol all \n\nWasn\u2019t referring to him at all was referring to \u201cthe next one\u201d\n \n\nThe Prince Charming bs is what gets women in these predicaments to begin with lmaoo", "Agreed. The best AITA\u2019s are when the OP\u2019s really take the effort to listen and realize.", "Lmfao \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 sorry your husband cheated on you", "Some people just want to hear what others have to say about the whole thing. It\u2019s not like everyone who posts is having some insane moral dilemma", "So I\u2019m reading what OP said differently to you. I think OP is assuming husband expects her to take on the kid when he\u2019s away as opposed to making other arrangements. I didn\u2019t read it that OP said husband categorically expected her to provide childcare, if that\u2019s the case then I agree with you, I just didn\u2019t read it that way.", "So OP never said that husband said he expected her to become primary carer, at least in the way I read it, OP is assuming that as opposed to knowing for definite. If husband said that he expects OP to be primary carer then I agree he\u2019s an A H for that, however, that was unclear to me as written.", "Wife has the right to leave and OP has the right to become a parent, therefore I couldn\u2019t disagree with you more strongly.", "He made a decision to take on responsibility for his child, he\u2019s decided his child is more important than OP, that doesn\u2019t make him an A H, it makes him a grown up!", "I don\u2019t want kids but I wouldn\u2019t date a deadbeat dad.", "I mean, empathy? I'm not a cat person but if my bf was like \"I got a cat but didn't want it so I just dropped it off in the middle of nowhere\" I would still have an issue with that", "That you don't want kids doesn't mean you don't care about them.\n\nI don't want kids but damn do I hate bad parents.", "Because it's evidence that he's a trash person? Like OP basically is saying she married someone who treated an innocent baby like shit, and then she's surprised when he treats her like that too.", "You're joking right? I'd be side eying anyone who just casually shrugs at a neglectful parent", "Ugh no, abandoning the human you created is infinitely worse than never creating another human at all.\n\nA deadbeat parent is the worst kind of person.", "Basic human decency?", "Big difference between not wanting a kid and having one and saying \"fuck him\". That's a huge character flaw & shows a lack of integrity.", "Because it\u2019s a sign of poor character", "Not wanting kids doesn\u2019t mean not caring about them. It doesn\u2019t even mean not liking them. It also doesn\u2019t mean supporting child abandonment.", "Someone who doesn\u2019t want kids is not equivalent to someone who doesn\u2019t care about kids. OP was unbothered because the kid had a Mom at the time. But I agree with the poster who said she\u2019s TA for supporting a dead beat Dad. He rejected his Son. That sucks.", "Let's pretend someone has absolutely no morals or ethics whatsoever except self-interest. EVEN THEN, you reject someone who is a deadbeat dad because if he will abandon and neglect his own flesh and blood who he made himself, if he is going to refuse to take responsibility for the decisions he made leading up to the creation of that person, what's he likely to do to you? The same and worse.", "So are you opposed to the child being in your house if you don't have to watch he while working", "Since he didn't bother to even mention the situation to her before he made the decision,  I don't think it's a stretch to think he'd do this without talking to her.", "I got that from what she wrote 'he works away from home while I work remote, so he expects me to be mommy throughout the day, to which I said hell no. We've been fighting about this since'.\n\nHe would be firmly NTA if he promised her zero impact and arranged childcare on his own, like a nanny or his family, but that's not what he did. He imposed this on her and got angry with her when she refused", "He made the decision to take on responsibility for his child without talking to his WIFE and expected her to JOIN him in his decision to parent. That does make him an asshole.", "His body his choice?", "Seriously. I'm actively and fiercely childfree, but if someone told me that I would be horrified. Like obviously they could say something to make me feel better, such as I had a vasectomy that failed and I take full financial responsibility for the child but other than that no.", "show me where it says he completly abandoned his child instead. If you show me that I will side with you guys then but I didnt see info saying he wasnt sending support or somehting.", "Why are you wording it like you are asking me? Lol idc its not my kid. She has no obligation either way and is divorcing him as per her edit.", "He\u2019s decided his child is more important to him than OP, that\u2019s a completely justifiable decision and he once he decided that, he doesn\u2019t need to get OPs permission, just live with the consequences.", "I read that as OP making an assumption rather than him having an intention for OP to be primary carer, but I\u2019ve been wrong before and I\u2019ll be wrong again.", "He made the decision to take on his child and let the chips fall where they fall with his wife. There is nothing to indicate he would abandon the child if his wife leaves, therefore he\u2019s simply prioritizing his child and seeing how things play out with OP.", "Yeah. He chose where to put his dick and to do so unprotected. \n\nHis body. His choice.", "Agreed. I once dated a guy with kids.\n\nI saw a text of his daughter saying she misses him and realized he hadn't seen her for 3 weeks and left her on read. That shit crushed my heart. \n\nNever dated a guy with kids again. You can't act like cf if you aren't.", "That was my thought too like initial panic on her part, but they fought over it after she said no", "So would you rather force him to be a father? What kinda of a father would he have been? He\u2019s keeps showing he\u2019s not all up for it.", "Yeah, he's a shit dad and a shit human who is going to continue being a shit dad for the rest of time. \n\nI'd kind of prefer he not have a kid at all because, as mentioned above, he's a shit dad and a shit person. But you also don't get to excuse being a shit dad just because you are a shit dad. He doesn't get a moral pass for dumping his kid and treating them like shit just because he would have also treated a kid like shit if he was present."]}
