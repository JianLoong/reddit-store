I work from 5:30 am to 5:30 pm and she's a stay at home mom. Generally the days look like this when I get off work. \n\nI come in and despite having a very physical job and being dirty and sweaty the first thing I do is kiss her and the kids and ask if she wants me to take them while she showers. Her showers generally last about 45 minutes. I'm 99% of the time the one to cook dinner also. Recently she's been saying she does everything when it comes to our responsibilities and the house and kids which strikes me as weird because she always told me she hates people that tell women \"they make the money and pay the bills\" it feels like the same exact thing but in a different sense where it's \"I do everything and watch the kids all day\" I generally am rushed about 10 minutes uses into my shower with a \"I need help out here\" which I jump out right away everytime. My main question here is am I the asshole for feeling this way and unappreciated with the fact that I'm working 12 hour days 5 days a week to keep up with Financials? We do trips to legoland and zoos and constantly take the kids out and everytime I'm off I'm spending time with them but it never seems to be enough for her. To be fair alot of her frustration comes from my family being in another state and her family wanting nothing to do with our children or our lives. We don't have parents or grandparents local that are ever willing to give a hand so she's constantly with the children.", "created_utc": 1693539388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166w6ew/aita_for_thinking_my_wife_is_over_exaggerating/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NAH. You\u2019re both working long hours at physically demanding jobs. With two such young kids, she\u2019s most likely not even getting bathroom breaks. Literally. \n\nThings will get easier as the children get older. In the meantime, I think you two should try to have a discussion about communication and showing more appreciation with each others words. Sounds like you\u2019re both doing your best, but would benefit from building each other up a bit.", "Yikes. Smh. I am exhausted just thinking about it. A toddler and a baby. You both have a lot going on. She got pregnant with the second before the first one was a year old. I don't know if you can afford it, but you guys need help, if even for a couple hours a day.", "You're kids can't remember the zoo or Legoland.. why are you spending money to entertain them to these places instead of cheaper alternatives? \n\nNAH but something has to change for both of you. Moving to your family as suggested, stop spending on \"experiences\" and use it for a sitter, or dang just flipping move. 4k for housing is insane. Literally INSANE for your small family. She's got no breaks, you got no breaks, everyone is burnt tf out.", "NAH. It kind of sounds like your wife is overwhelmed. Two babies back-to-back can definitely do that. And she has no support besides you and you are gone 12+ hours a day. She needs kid-free time. You guys probably need couple time.", "NAH. 12 hours of work feels like a lot. You're likely tired, and you're going home and tagging in on kids. \n\nShe spends those 12, plus your commute, with two kids under two. She's also tired, and she's likely had less adult interaction. \n\nYou're both drained. You're both feeling and saying things you might not, otherwise. \n\nShe's not exaggerating, and neither are you. It's just hard.", "NAH. You are both doing a ton to support your family. Two kids under 1.5 years old is a ton to handle. Neither of you have it easy right now. Try to give each other as much grace as possible.\n\nIt may be nothing,  but if you really thinking your wife is struggling more than she should,  it might be wise to check in with her and ask some questions to see if shes possibly dealing with post partum depression. My wife had it after our first and it fucked with her head. You don't want to mess around with that,  it can get dangerous in a hurry.", "How old are the children?", "NTA.\n\nYou need to have a serious sit-down talk with your wife at some point after the kids are in bed. Write some things down and show her what you do every day to keep a roof over your heads and meals in the fridge. And then add to that list the fact that you are also cooking meals and entertaining the kids when you are off. Ask her how much MORE are you supposed to do? Let her know that when you are at work, it's not just standing around and drinking beverages. \n\nCome to an understanding with this issue, because she needs to realize that her life would be much harder without the things that you contribute. You both have value, but she's discounting yours right now.", "wth? if shes SAHM then you shouldnt even lift a finger in the household. NTA.", "NTA.  Thinking is not asshole worthy.  With the drought that has been ongoing for at least 10 years, how is it that you allow her a 45 minute shower?", "NTA. I think you've Cottondale on to the problem though. Children can be draining and hard work, and not mentally stimulating for some. Perhaps suggest she dip her toes back into the workforce for a break from the kids? Even part time? Going back to work moved mountains for me", " NTA. I understand 2 children - especially at 7 mo & 16 mo, respectively - are a lot of work. If you want my honest opinion, while you absolutely need to be involved in childcare & stuff, at least in my immediate & extended family, the women who stayed home weren\u2019t \u2018getting a break\u2019 when the husbands came home. Their job was the household\u2026 and yes, it\u2019s also hard & demanding af. I think it\u2019s a bit much that she is seemingly unable or unwilling to recognise your contributions. \n\nMaybe she needs to join some kind of mum meet up group in your area. While not family, she may find friends who are willing to trade off & help on another sometimes.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it comes down to whether she wants/can get a job outside the home (that won\u2019t just go to taxes) or whether she wants to stay at home. If she wants to stay at home, great, but part of that means you aren\u2019t going to be able to do everything she expects of you due to long hours, a commute, etc. It\u2019s unreasonable to believe otherwise.\n\nThe only good thing is that I believe it will likely become a bit easier as your kids continue getting older & they\u2019re more able to entertain themselves & one another & don\u2019t require the same level of supervision. I\u2019m sorry. This sounds like an awful situation.", "NTA at all\u2026 AT ALL. She is being unreasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's exhausting and neverending. \n\nIt's great that you take over and make dinner while she showers. She's probably just decompressing (or crying) in the shower.\n\nQuit taking your kids to expensive places--they won't remember it anyway. Go to a park or, if the weather sucks, check out a mall or a McDonald's with a play place so she can get some solitude. \n\nToddlers and babies are cute and fun but it's also really draining.

The sleep regressions, the constant crying, the random bodily fluids, the cleaning up behind a pocket tornado and professional pooper. \n\nI think you both could benefit from some couples time, and maybe some small talks about appreciation.
