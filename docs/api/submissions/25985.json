Moving to your family as suggested, stop spending on \"experiences\" and use it for a sitter, or dang just flipping move. 4k for housing is insane. Literally INSANE for your small family. She's got no breaks, you got no breaks, everyone is burnt tf out.", "NAH. It kind of sounds like your wife is overwhelmed. Two babies back-to-back can definitely do that.

You're likely tired, and you're going home and tagging in on kids. \n\nShe spends those 12, plus your commute, with two kids under two.

You don't want to mess around with that,  it can get dangerous in a hurry.", "How old are the children?", "NTA.\n\nYou need to have a serious sit-down talk with your wife at some point after the kids are in bed. Write some things down and show her what you do every day to keep a roof over your heads and meals in the fridge. And then add to that list the fact that you are also cooking meals and entertaining the kids when you are off. Ask her how much MORE are you supposed to do? Let her know that when you are at work, it's not just standing around and drinking beverages. \n\nCome to an understanding with this issue, because she needs to realize that her life would be much harder without the things that you contribute. You both have value, but she's discounting yours right now.", "wth? if shes SAHM then you shouldnt even lift a finger in the household. NTA.", "NTA.  Thinking is not asshole worthy.  With the drought that has been ongoing for at least 10 years, how is it that you allow her a 45 minute shower?", "NTA. I think you've Cottoned on to the problem though. Children can be draining and hard work, and not mentally stimulating for some. Perhaps suggest she dip her toes back into the workforce for a break from the kids? Even part time? Going back to work moved mountains for me", " NTA. I understand 2 children - especially at 7 mo & 16 mo, respectively - are a lot of work. If you want my honest opinion, while you absolutely need to be involved in childcare & stuff, at least in my immediate & extended family, the women who stayed home weren\u2019t \u2018getting a break\u2019 when the husbands came home. Their job was the household\u2026 and yes, it\u2019s also hard & demanding af. I think it\u2019s a bit much that she is seemingly unable or unwilling to recognise your contributions. \n\nMaybe she needs to join some kind of mum meet up group in your area. While not family, she may find friends who are willing to trade off & help on another sometimes.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it comes down to whether she wants/can get a job outside the home (that won\u2019t just go to taxes) or whether she wants to stay at home. If she wants to stay at home, great, but part of that means you aren\u2019t going to be able to do everything she expects of you due to long hours, a commute, etc. It\u2019s unreasonable to believe otherwise.\n\nThe only good thing is that I believe it will likely become a bit easier as your kids continue getting older & they\u2019re more able to entertain themselves & one another & don\u2019t require the same level of supervision. I\u2019m sorry. This sounds like an awful situation.", "NTA at all\u2026 AT ALL. She is being unreasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, communication will help simply by letting you both feel your frustrations are being heard, and possibly you can work out a way to organize the time after you get home.\n\nFor example, she probably immediately takes a very long shower because she feels it will be her only time for herself all day, but if you worked it out that you did some other things later in the evening to free her up she wouldn\u2019t feel like that was her only chance and she wouldn\u2019t  have to take 45 minutes.\n\nI know from experience that both of you are working hard and probably feel unappreciated.
