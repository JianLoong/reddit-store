I asked her if she would like some bacon and an egg sandwich, she said yes. She does prefer mayo on both sides of the toast when she has this but as I prepared it all, I forgot. As soon as I set it in front of her, I remembered and said \u201chold on I forgot the mayo and I\u2019ll go put it on real quick.\u201d to which she replied, \u201cforget it, it\u2019s fucked now.\u201d. I got upset by this comment as it made me feel as if I had somehow ruined breakfast so I tried to explain that it was an easy remedy and the sandwich was most definitely not \u201cfucked\u201d. She told me to just forget it again so I went back into the kitchen and finished making my sandwich and sat down. She came in and started to talk about how she thought it would be a fried egg, which again, just felt like she was complaining about nothing as I never said I would be making a fried egg, just stated bacon and an egg sandwich. When I got upset that she seemed to still just be complaining, she basically told me that I was wrong, she wasn\u2019t complaining and was just making comments and I was being an asshole for being upset since she didn\u2019t say anything wrong. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I scrambled the eggs in a bowl with some seasoning and a bit of milk. Put it in the bacon grease and waited until it was cooked on the bottom, flipped the egg like a pancake and cooked the other side. Cut it in half and put it on the toast like a sandwich.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate everyone\u2019s thoughts and concerns, I had no idea this would jump up to almost 400 comments in an hour. Please feel free to keep commenting but I apologize if I no longer reply, I feel like I got the answers I needed and will be having a deeper discussion with my fianc\u00e9 tonight when she gets off work.

I don\u2019t care if it's a single scrambled egg, a  sandwich or a bowl of cereal. Making a meal for someone is an act of service and she was a rude asshole about it.", "NTA. You didn't take her comments wrong. She sucks.\n\nDoes she behave like this when you eat out? Is she one of those who screams at waiters if the food is not as she wants it to be?", "NTA.\n\nIf she is that particular about her breakfast sandwiches made graciously by someone else, she should make them herself. \n\nI'd be happy if someone poured me a bowl of cereal in the morning.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, what? Lift the top layer of toast, apply mayo, flip the sandwich and do the same. You've got exactly what would have been created in the first place. And no idea why she would be complaining about it being scrambled instead of fried when you never said it was a fried egg, unless she doesn't like scrambled eggs or something?

Mayo.", "NTA, she sounds really mean. Just swearing at you bc you forgot some mayo on the breakfast you MADE for her. Mean.

I'm VERY particular about my tea and coffee, my SO messes it up everytime he makes it, even though I've showed him how I make it several times. So, I wanna give you MASSIVE kudos for knowing exactly how she likes her sandwich, it means you're paying attention.\n\nThat being said, when my SO gets me coffee, and it's \"wrong\" I still thank them for the effort and drink it if possible, if not I just dump it and make my own, STILL THANKING THEM.. it's a me issue, not a them issue.\n\nDefinitely NTA, maybe she was just hangry, but still... That was mean. Hope you guys can talk it out. All the best.", "NTA. The correct response to people being nice to you is \"thanks\".", "NTA, but she's rather awful.

Because this is exactly how my 2 year old acts if I cut her sandwich in the wrong shape, or the cup is the wrong colour. She doesn\u2019t swear at me, but she will tell me she doesn\u2019t like me anymore. \n\nEven with the potential for disordered eating, she\u2019s the asshole.

My spouse, who seldom cooked for the first part of our marriage, because they didn't know how, has learned in the last decade and is an excellent cook now.

If they are, she can get therapy and learn to not do this to you, for a healthy relationship.   \n\n**You should not accept her telling you that your feelings, about being complained at, aren't valid, or that you are to blame for objecting to her wrong behavior.

Just as a side note for next time though I'd prefer the mayo put on right away or not all, and I like my egg over easy instead of scrambled.\" There are so many ways she could have handled that but she chose to be confrontational and snotty.

Even so, her reaction is pretty extreme to a meal she didn't have to make herself, and was what you had offered. \n\nI'd guess, barred it being a triggering kind of event, she's actually pissy about something else, and wanted to vent.

Bad enough she's an ingrate complaining about food made for her, she then tries to gaslight you into thinking YOU'RE the asshole?  Yes, you screwed up leaving off the mayo when you know how she likes it.  Not your fault for not knowing she wanted a fried egg - this time.  Definitely not your fault when she won't leave it alone and keeps harping on all the ways you messed up her breakfast.\n\nShe was most assuredly complaining.  You did not take it wrong.

Comments like that are why I stopped cooking eggs for my wife.", "NTA she acted ungrateful and unappreciative.

This is certainly not a breakup offense, but I\u2019d definitely investigate whether this is a one-off thing vs. pervasive in other parts of the relationship.
