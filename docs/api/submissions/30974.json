That's what I always tell people - everyone has different levels of frustration and what they will/can't put up with.

Yes, it sucks sometimes to be exhausted and realize that dinner still needs to find a way to the table. That's just how it goes sometimes.

Which this sounds like from the post. \n\nUnless she regularly promises to do things and then gets angry with you for expecting the thing she promised - it was probably just a bad day & she\u2019s not perfect. None of us are. \n\nI have accepted in recent years that I\u2019m just not willing to cook after work - I\u2019m exhausted & I just don\u2019t want to. So I\u2019ve learned to compensate by doing bulk cooking at the weekend. Mid week we have my leftovers or my partner cooks, coz he quite likes to relax after work by cooking. \n\nSo I have sympathy with her for promising to cook & liking the *idea* of it - but then having a meltdown when she realised she\u2019d been unrealistic & was exhausted & hangry (which is totally a thing). \n\n**Was she an AH for what she said & how she reacted\u2026? Yes of course!**  But if it\u2019s not her normal, and can be explained by [tired] + [hungry] + [angry with herself for failing on her promise] then it doesn\u2019t sound break up worthy to me. \n\nThis sounds like a reasonable outcome would be more: an apology from her, plus maybe a sneaky takeout once or twice this week to take the pressure off both of you - and then a joint planning session to figure out how to make life easier on both of you. \n\nIf you can afford a fortnightly cleaner with 2 salaries then I would strongly recommend it. Makes a massive difference to have someone else do the whole place regularly. \n\nAnd plan for some nights being no-cook nights.

Her house was also only a few blocks away from mine so it was like a 3 minute drive or 15 minute walk. The amount of time it took out of my schedule wasn't an inconvenience. It was just the principle of feeling like I had to do everything. Honestly, I think she only came to my house maybe three or four times in the course of nearly two years, so maybe that should've been a red flag.", "What an ignorant statement. Not all WFH jobs are just doing excel and data-entry. If you want to know, I own a fairly successful online marketing company that operates in a very niche market. As such, all of my employees and most of my clients are based elsewhere so I don't have any need to pay for a real office. My work may not be life or death like working in a hospital, but that doesn't mean it isn't stressful. Unless you know what work OP does, you also can't say that his job is any less stressful or taxing.", ">Sounds like most females in a relationship.\n\nYeah. It made me really happy to be raised how I was. My parents split everything as equally as possible, and they made sure that my brother and I knew from an early age that there was no such thing as men's chores and women's chores. We learned how to do laundry, cook, scrub toilets and whatever else, and we were expected to help our parents with the housework since they worked long hours.", "She *said* she would cook and even **asked** OP to get the groceries for said meal\n\nIt\u2019s not about who likes cooking or not, OP communicated their needs, gf agreed, failed to do their part, then bitched at OP for not being a mindreader", "I do all the cooking because I enjoy it more and my SO isn't as keen.  I do all the grocery shopping because I know what I'll need SO would be clueless.  SO does the clean up", "This is the most nonsensical non sequitur opinion here.\n\nThank you for sharing what your partner does. OPs partner said they'd cook, then welched. Please try to stay on topic.", "Do you take over the cleaning up?That seems like the fair thing to do.", "No, she needs to put on her big girl pants and contribute to the house work. If she isn\u2019t capable of that, then she isn\u2019t capable of being an equal partner and she\u2019ll have to do all of it by herself anyways", "2 hours more?  What the fuck?  This is incredibly unrealistic and unfair. I was the one in my relationship for a long time that had a 2 hour commute while my husband had about 2 minutes. Never in a million years would I have expected him to clean for 2 extra hours a day, because that's absolutely illogical and insane.", "What? It\u2019s not OPs fault the partner is commuting. Yes, he can help a little more, and he apparently does it most of the time. But \u201cshould\u201d? Those 2hs commuting can be used for reading, listening to music or sleeping, or watching stuff on the phone.", "I think it's fair to consider commute time as time spent doing chores. If the commutes are significantly lopsided, that extra time spent commuting should be emotionally accounted for as in-like-kind to doing household chores.", "Oh trust me I do whatever I can. She\u2019s pregnant now too so I do everything I can. But it doesn\u2019t take 3 hours to throw stuff in the dishwasher. Our split isn\u2019t 50/50. But because she can do it during her lunch break and stuff, she does. And when I\u2019m on lunch, I do administrative stuff like paying bills and what not. \n\nIt\u2019s not ideal but individuals who can work from home don\u2019t need to shower and driving to and from work have a couple extra minutes that they can do stuff.", "There are definitely chores that lend themselves to work from home. Laundry if you have a washing machine and dishes if you have a dish washer. I have high use surfaces that I try to tidy while I make my lunch or whatever. None of these tasks take more than 10-15 mins. Plus they give you a move around break if you\u2019ve been sitting.", "I think it really depends. A lot of hospital jobs are stressful, but analyzing samples and stuff like this that is way less so, since there isn\u2019t patient interaction.\n\nOn the flip side, any wfh customer service position dealing with customers is probably stressful af. My (mostly) wfh job is pretty stressful because it requires a lot of analysis and deadlines. But I generally don\u2019t have to talk to clients and those I do are cool.", "Commuting is stressful af, and driving for long stretches is exhausting. Let\u2019s not act like WFH doesn\u2019t have its perks. Not commuting is a HUGE one.", ">People assume that us remote workers don't do crap all day \n\nand people who wfh assume that people who go to offices enjoy sitting in their car for three hours 'chilling' to music \ud83d\ude44", "This depends on the individuals' perspectives. I know a lot of people would honestly be more relaxed eating lunch at home and doing last night's dishes rather than sitting in a trafficked area (work lunch room, public cafe) and staring at your phone. It's a completely different energy. Being \"home\" is a powerful feeling that is difficult to rival.   \n\n\nBut yes, it does sound like she's taking advantage of OP and he should move on if she refuses to acknowledge it.", "Yea, I do 95% of the cooking (and I enjoy cooking most of the time), but my fianc\u00e9 does all the clean up after dinner.\n\nBut all the other chores around the house are pretty evenly split. We take care of our own laundry and switch off who does the communal laundry. We each have \u201czones\u201d that we deep clean. And we both do the light chores as we need them.", "Apparently he does all the chores plus grocery shopping and works a forty hour week. What does she do when she gets home?  Even paying more doesn\u2019t mean he has to do it all plus work. It just doesn\u2019t seem fair to me.", "If OP calls it quits and leaves the relationship, his then ex-GF also needs to get food on the table, the laundry done and the bath cleaned. \nSo no, OP does not need to lower his expectations. His GF needs to pull her weight.", "Sounds like Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights have passed and she admits she had no intention of following through.", "She didn't want to hire a housekeeper? What was her reaction when you said you wanted to break up?", "That\u2019s awesome. \n\nMy family wasn\u2019t like that, but I guess it didn\u2019t matter in my case.  Clearly you had better role models than most men. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean you should be taken advantage of like that. She was completely taking advantage of you, as if YOUR work hour\u2019s didn\u2019t count at all.", "That was a \u201cI\u2019ll say this to end this conversation, but never follow through with it,\u201d moment.", "She bitched at OP for not being a mindreader and her slave!!!", "And of course, since he works from home, he doesn't \"really\" work, so he can't possibly understand being exhausted when he comes home. This is a complete no win for OP.", ">SO does the clean up\n\nMy wife and I both enjoy cooking. We have a deal. When she cooks, I clean. When I cook, I clean. Apparently my negotiation skills need work.", "I do all the cooking, shopping, and meal planning in my house. My wife does all the deep cleaning. It's a fair exchange for us.", "Regularity!.", "Eh driving commute is different than train commute. And both partners should have equal free time.", "So working from home is easier than working at the office right? And why is that? Because you don't have to drive and that's it? How should tasks be splitted if both work at the office? Then it's ok to split them 50/50?", "Quick question. How long were those ingredients she had you buy good for? That should give you your timeframe.", "OK, this may be getting to the heart of the disagreement. When you quote her saying \"I'll cook a surprise meal this week,\" that to me does not mean \"tonight,\" \"tomorrow,\" or \"every night this week.\" It means \"some night this week, I will cook a meal as a surprise.\" I read her as offering *one* meal and not specifying a day.\n\nIf that's also what she thinks she said, then that's where your conflict lies.", "Some people don't like cooking. If he doesn't mind cooking, maybe she can do other things instead.", "All of this happened on Monday night (yesterday) by my read. The second day of the week. Per OP, she was supposed to have yesterday off, but got called in. My guess is she would do it on a day she does have off.", "She was upset and wanted me to stay, but it was too late by that point. It had been close to a year of me asking for things to change and saying I would probably reconsider the relationship if they didn't. No ultimatums, but I made my point clear. I don't think she really believed me even after I said we were done as she kept asking me to come over for months.", "She gave him a shopping list, so I'd say it was more than a \"moment\".", "Haha, I love the audacity of her saying OP should know she'd be tired after work blah blah.\n\nYet, she hasn't made any effort to help OP out. When OP is also working and doing all the house stuff including cooking.\n\nLike...1 night of dinner should be that hard, even if she brought home take-away food that one night. It would have been more considerate.\n\nShe's so \"me, Me, me\"", "Man, you ARE getting the short end of that stick.  Get your butt back to the negotiating table, pronto!  \ud83e\udd1e", "Interesting. What if one listens to music or podcasts while driving, does that count as free or busy time?", ">So working from home is easier than working at the office right?\n\nas someone who as wfh and commuted, abso-fucking-lutely walking from your bed to your desk is easier than driving or catching public transport\n\nyou have a point that it doesn't mean that the wfh partner has to do all the work but you're destroying it in your insistence that commuting is so! much! fun!", "Again not what I\u2019m saying. I never said all the housework. I think it should be divided up by how much actual work you have to do. Obviously if the person who WFH works longer hours and has less free time then yes, they should not be doing all the work. Also no one ever should be doing literally all the work. I said that so many times in my comment that OP should not be expected to do all the work. This comment was also not directed to OP. But ALSO in this case OP is a healthcare worker and they work super super long hours so I\u2019m assuming GF here has longer hours than OP but I\u2019m not sure. Which again is why my comment was directed at the commenter and not the OP. I swear Redditors will read one part of the comment and run with it lol", "I think their true conflict lies in the fact that she feels entitled to his time and effort. She thinks her job is the only one that matters, she\u2019s the only one allowed to be tired at the end of the day, etc. Throwing a tantrum for not having dinner waiting at home (after he already expressed feeling overwhelmed with doing all the chores) is not a sign of a good partner.", "I agree . If she doesn\u2019t like it then she shouldn\u2019t have told her bf she would . I just think these 2 have hard time communicating . Maybe she can cook on days she has off and days she is working he can cook. Being in a relationship is a partner ship . Everything doesn\u2019t have to be 50/50 sometimes it\u2019s 70/30 every relationship is different but communicating is key and being able to communicate and not get mad is key to a successful relationship", "To clean probably lol", "She said \"this week\" and we're two days into the week.\n\nETA: And from my read, this all happened yesterday, one day into the week.", "And I would like to point out that working from home is still working and can still be exhausting. Not dismissing the gf and working in a hospital or similar but just because OP is working from home does NOT mean they have boundless energy and free time.", "For real! How can she behave like this and think her partner will tolerate it?! If he breaks up with her, I bet you she\u2019ll bitch to all her friends about how selfish he was etc without any self-awareness of how she messed up!", "I don\u2019t know. Is that person free to do whatever they want or are they busy with non-optional tasks? \n\nIf OP listens to music while he cooks or cleans, does that mean he\u2019s not busy?", "OP literally said in the post they are overwhelmed from work right now and gf is not doing their share after saying they would. Regardless of WFH, if both people are working equal hours, they do equal work. Being at home doesn't mean the chores are less tiring or demanding. The person working from home is *working*. Why do people not understand this concept?", "You're*", "Probably bought fresh ingredients that are withering.", "My mom's been working from home since covid, she's also the main accountant for her company, handling basically 95% of all their jobs and inventory spending. She's on call even when's she's clocked out, wakes up at 7 and works till 6 in the afternoon most days, she does get an hour lunch from her bosses so she can walk her dog though. \n\nI've never seen a bigger desk, she has four monitors that are basically always on and full of text and receipts. Working from home is called that for a reason, your house becomes your workspace, you are expected to be available outside of work hours for some reason as well, and because there's no \"leaving\" fully, the day can stretch on much easier.", "Personally, \u201cdriving + music\u201d is closer to free time than \u201ccooking + music\u201d. Because, personally, cooking needs much more focus than driving. \nApplying your logic, because OP is working longer, the partner should work longer as well. Because if OP doesn\u2019t have free-time, the partner shouldn\u2019t have any either.", "Bro what are people not fucking understand about me saying my comment *was not about OP* I wrote it like 3 times. This really just proves my point that Redditors don\u2019t even read comments fully before they disagree \ud83e\udd26 I already said in this chain like 10 times OP should be doing less work around the house if he\u2019s overwhelmed. I\u2019ve said that already. I agree with your sentiment. You\u2019re arguing to a wall rn", "dude, pay more attention to while driving. Jesus Christ, you could kill not only yourself by multiple other people as well.", ">cooking needs much more focus than driving.\n\nHoly shit, please tell me you don't drive. Or say this to impressionable people.", "You're not likely to kill somebody when washing the dishes, but with that attitude you're a car crash waiting to happen.", "Because your original comment indicates that doing chores is easier when working from home and therefore that person might need to take on more workload. It's literally right there. You even indicate that OP could take on more since he's home.", "No worries, I have plenty experience driving while playing \u201cEruption\u201d by Van Hallen on my guitar.

I didn\u2019t do a good job with expressing what I was trying to say so I\u2019m not surprised I\u2019m getting downvoted. It doesn\u2019t matter to me cause it\u2019s just Reddit so I won\u2019t bother clarifying my original comments but what I meant was in general if you work from home and your partner has long hours maybe do the dishes a little more if you have the time since your already home. I didn\u2019t mean the WFH person should do everything. I didn\u2019t do a good job of stating that part. But also I did state several times I was replying to this specific comment and not OPs situation"]}
