That's what I always tell people - everyone has different levels of frustration and what they will/can't put up with.

Yes, it sucks sometimes to be exhausted and realize that dinner still needs to find a way to the table. That's just how it goes sometimes.

Which this sounds like from the post. \n\nUnless she regularly promises to do things and then gets angry with you for expecting the thing she promised - it was probably just a bad day & she\u2019s not perfect. None of us are. \n\nI have accepted in recent years that I\u2019m just not willing to cook after work - I\u2019m exhausted & I just don\u2019t want to. So I\u2019ve learned to compensate by doing bulk cooking at the weekend. Mid week we have my leftovers or my partner cooks, coz he quite likes to relax after work by cooking. \n\nSo I have sympathy with her for promising to cook & liking the *idea* of it - but then having a meltdown when she realised she\u2019d been unrealistic & was exhausted & hangry (which is totally a thing). \n\n**Was she an AH for what she said & how she reacted\u2026? Yes of course!**  But if it\u2019s not her normal, and can be explained by [tired] + [hungry] + [angry with herself for failing on her promise] then it doesn\u2019t sound break up worthy to me. \n\nThis sounds like a reasonable outcome would be more: an apology from her, plus maybe a sneaky takeout once or twice this week to take the pressure off both of you - and then a joint planning session to figure out how to make life easier on both of you. \n\nIf you can afford a fortnightly cleaner with 2 salaries then I would strongly recommend it. Makes a massive difference to have someone else do the whole place regularly. \n\nAnd plan for some nights being no-cook nights.

Right now i'm at this point where I will have to start cleaning/cooking after work instead of on my lunch break.", "How does OP seems selfish? He also works and do most of the household chores. Is that selfish?", "Wage discrepancies don\u2019t have anything to do with it . If your going to say ur going to do something and then don\u2019t do it that\u2019s bullshit and then on top of that  blame your partner and get mad at them  that\u2019s straight up gas lighting  and manipulation. Think about this what if she was single and living alone . What will she do order food everyday when she finishes work or will she be forced to cook . She would then have all the house hold chores to do\nFor herself . She is just trying to take advantage . I could understand her if op was lazy and didn\u2019t do anything in the house . But he is not , he handles the other chores in the house and has been doing it for along time . Everybody works but that\u2019s not an excuse to not doing anything and put it all on ur partner . He should break up with her", "She gets paid more than I do and pays $300 more than I do in rent.", "How is it poor communication? OP said he\u2019s overwhelmed doing basically everything while working a full time job. His GF said she would cook. However, she didn\u2019t because she too tired, but expects OP to do it. How is that poor communication when he clearly communicated being overwhelmed, and she agreed that she\u2019d cook and try to help out?", "I agree.", "He is \u201ehelping\u201c in this case, though - he\u2019s taking on some of her share of chores.", "Crock pot is a good idea.", ">You cannot deny that getting chores and stuff done is easier WFH if you don\u2019t have kids.\n\nOf course it's easier to expect the person at home to do more chores, but that doesn't make it right.  Nor is that that behavior of a true partner.\n\nGF needs to learn, like all of  us working shmucks have already learned, is that life doesn't stop just because you're tired after work.  Dinner needs to be cooked, dishes put away, and laundry did.  Then there is cleaning the floors on the weekend, mowing, trimming the hedge, and on  and on it goes.  She's selfish as hell.", "Yes! Or since they are both feeling overwhelmed, get a weeks worth of easy comfort meals like frozen entrees, soups, etc. so that it doesn\u2019t have to be anyone\u2019s chore for several days.", "Asking one person to do 100% of the cooking really is almost never fair unless the other person is willing to do 100% of the cleaning. Cooking is a lot.", "Sometimes they do. Some couples balance it so the person with the greater financial burden does fewer chores. It just depends. She works in a hospital which is tiring work. He sits at home all day. So, they have to find a balance. Maybe on her day off she might want to cook.", ">She said I shouldn't expect this of her because she will always be too tired to cook right when she comes home from work and I should have known that.\n\nClassic poor communication. She didn't *say* \"I will always be too tired to cook on a work day,\" but she expected him to know it. Neither of them actually communicated which day this \"surprise\" dinner would land on. \n\nNow he's feeling unsupported because she said she would help and hasn't yet, and she's feeling unsupported because he's pushing back on a duty she has come to take for granted.", "It\u2019s my favorite solution for less time consuming meals along side the rice cooker. :)", "> of course it\u2019s easier to expect the person at home to do more chores, but that doesn\u2019t make it right.\n\nWhy not? You just admitted it\u2019s easier to do chores when working from home. I\u2019m not saying OP should continue to do as much as their doing now cause clearly they are overwhelmed. But to suggest that they each do 50/50 when OP WFH and the GF has one of the most demanding jobs you can have is also unfair. Yes if the gf was living alone she would have to do all this anyway but she doesn\u2019t live alone. Again clarifying that I don\u2019t think OP is TA who wanting gf to cool dinner once this week. But I\u2019m confused as to why you don\u2019t think a fair divide that OP does slightly more in the home because they are able to actually be in the home more isn\u2019t \u201cright\u201d as you put it", "I agree. It sounds like some adjustments need to be made. I don\u2019t understand why someone has to cook every single night anyway unless there is a reason they don\u2019t want to do easy meals, take out, or delivery.", "You do realize a WFH job can also be stressful and tiring right?", "Ur right sometimes it does . But that\u2019s not the case here . She said she would cook and she not then she is getting mad at op  .i can understand she gets tired , but just because u finish  working doesn\u2019t mean ur day is done . There is other responsibilities outside of work and what will she do if she lived alone and had to do all the house chores herself .she doesn\u2019t know what it means to be an independent adult", "You're partially right in that she didn't explicitly say when she would start cooking, it was implied to me that she would have started on Sunday.", "> But to suggest that they each do 50/50\n\nFull stop.  They both have jobs.  I'm not going to listen to a Nurses are superheroes speech.\n\nThey are partners.  To expect the at home partner to do a higher % of the house work is unreasonable.  If the OP can't get her to do more work, then he should consider leaving this one-sided relationship.\n\n\"I dissagre with the work from home thing as someone who doesn\u2019t have the privilege of WFH ever. \"\n\nCareful, your bias is showing.", "Just because someone works from home does not mean they have time to do all the house work. My husband has been home all day today. I\u2019ve seen him for a grand total of 15 minutes when he came out to grab some lunch. He has been chained to his desk with meetings the rest of the day. Some days he doesn\u2019t get off until 6 or 7 pm, especially if there\u2019s an issue or a big project needing to be finished. Just because OP\u2019s work is different from their gf\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean they should be expected to do all the housework.", "I intended my bias to show off the bat that is why I said this, Idc. I do understand what your saying. Again I do not think OP is TA. If they are overwhelmed then the work should be divided differently. And I agree that if the GF is unwilling to divide it differently than OP should really look at the relationship and think about things. \n\nBut I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not a 50/50 divide of labor if one person doesn\u2019t get home till after 8pm everyday (just an example I don\u2019t know OPs gf\u2019s schedule) and one person is at home the whole day. I think we just have a different idea of what 50/50 division of labor is. Not to mention the person being at home would be creating more of a mess anyway"]}
