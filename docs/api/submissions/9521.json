For them to have sex so loud the whole house can hear? No. That's not okay. Even if you're in your own home, if there are other people who might hear, it's just common courtesy to be quiet.", "My parents did it in MY BED in my apartment while I slept on the floor in the room. It was fucking awful. You can't even say anything because my dad gets angry and that I should be \"grateful\" that they still have sex. Instead I just felt violated.", "Yep, this reminds me of that post where the parents were swingers and wanted OP to comment on an article about how it\u2019s possible to lead that lifestyle without messing up your kids, and OP had to tell her parents she couldn\u2019t, it did traumatize her, and she resented her parents for essentially having her as a prop so they can seem normal. That\u2019s what this feels like.", "You are 100% spot on. This also sounds like emotional incest. Brad Shore, a Licensed Therapist on YouTube has lots of videos on the topic. NTA, OP. Not at all!", "Yes. I agree... Regarding sex in any form is one no and no matter how many yes. \n\nObviously within reason, it wouldn't be ok to try an impose this in their home, but it would be ok not to stay there.", "And the poor baby must wake up all the time. \nImagine having a newborn and the reason you can\u2019t sleep isn\u2019t crying, but because your parents are having loud sex.", "Yeah, that's a dick move \n\n<Giggity>", "Ya I came into this thinking OP was a kid at home who heard his parents at night and was going to go YTA but to visit your sons house and have loud sex in his spare bedroom is some weird shit", "It\u2019s so glad to see these comments \n\nEvery time a kid, sometimes an actual still kid, writes in about their parents keeping them up with this, it\u2019s Reeeeeeee, stop C blocking your parents you prude!!!!!\n\nHow do you think you were made?!\n\nBack in the 1800s, they\u2019d do it right in front of the kids and they were fine!!!!", "He\u2019s not even saying don\u2019t have sex at all; preferably just not when he\u2019s around", "I am amused by this, because when the shoe is on the other foot, people here tend to be mad at the parents for enforcing the same rule on their kids.", "This comment should be higher up!!", "They're a couple of exhibitionists who seized an opportunity to be heard.", "This.  NTA.", "I think it\u2019s important just how damaging this can be. I also grew up in poverty and my parents\u2019 bed was in the living room so I would be prevented from getting breakfast or using the bathroom in mornings because my mom and my stepdads were just *always* going at it and being super loud all the time. My mom has porn Star noises down to a T. They\u2019d keep me awake all night, even when I was a fresh victim of CSA I cannot hear people having sex without panicking now.  I was babysitting once and the woman came back with some fuckboy from the bar and started fucking and I made sure the baby was safe and told her where I went then walked home crying at 2am. I cannot date normally because I am weird about being touched and I don\u2019t want to be in a position to be heard by anyone else or be intimate with anyone: I know this is a super unhealthy position to be in but hearing your parents go at it like a bunch of sex crazed wolverines is really fucked up", "Exactly! I simply don\u2019t understand why parents would share something like this with their parents? They need to set boundaries, especially when their kids are uncomfortable with this topic", "They are grown adults, with grown children, they need to have some social awareness.", "Being able to have loud sex in your children home with them listening does not fall under the standard of what guests can do within someone\u2019s home. It would be unreasonable for OP to make a no sex rule if the parents were quiet and not forcing their children to listen. But they aren\u2019t, they are literally forcing their own children to listen to them having sex. That\u2019s not ok.", "Clearly they r sex freaks in front of their children and have no social awareness to control urself when your a guest at other people\u2019s home? Parents need to put up boundaries, especially when their kids are uncomfortable w it", "Wow you guys in the comments really excusing two grown adults\u2019 actions who have grown children. This is embarrassing for y\u2019all", "No one said they hated sex, do you have comprehension skills? Why should someone be happy when they are clearly uncomfortable in their own damn home?", "You sound like me of those sex freaks who are incapable of having social awareness. Is this is the parents burner account? \ud83e\udd14", "I think the parents should have more responsibility, like how retarted do you have to be, to be so damn loud during sex at ur kids house with a damn new born? Very childish", "He doesn't say, but maybe it was just that they have a squeaky guest bed. They might not have been screaming with pleasure, just eek eeking away.\n\nThe fact that his wife didn't mind, and other things in his post that show he's much more sensitive than most people about intimacy, makes me thing YTA and that his reaction was more to do with his inhibitions than anything else. Honestly shocked that everyone else seems to think otherwise", "Lmao WHAT???? Not even the, \u201cShhhhhhh\u2026.let\u2019s keep it quiet?\u201d Bruhhhhh the BALLs on your parents\u2026.or your dad. Lmao", "Tbh, I just think it\u2019s real squicky to hear your parents doing the horizontal tango so I\u2019m completely on OP\u2019s side.", "I am sorry\u2026 In your bed? While you were sleeping or attempting to on the floor?! That\u2019s absolutely vile, disrespectful and quite frankly traumatic.", "Why would you be grateful that they\u2019re still having sex lol? As if them not having sex would directly have a negative impact on you lol.", "Why on earth would YOU be grateful for them having sex still? Did you go no contact with them? Please say you did", "It\u2019s not emotional incest, it\u2019s full-on incest. They are intentionally directly involving their son in their sexual activities by forcing him to be an audience to their exhibitionist sex.", "That isn't at all emotional incest. Emotional incest does not actually involve sex. It means forcing a relative to take on your emotional needs the same way a partner would, as well as taking on other partner-specific activities (going out on dates, staying at home with them, etc). What they're doing is sucky, but it is not emotional incest.\n\nETA link on emotional incest: https://www.healthline.com/health/emotional-incest", "Wtf", "The parents would likely never shut up about it, further deepening the divide between them and their child.", "These are parents are creepy and would probably get off on it honestly. They would want to discuss it the next morning. I remember that letter to Dan by the way! He advocates for being sex positive but these parents are violating their son\u2019s boundaries. Non consensually forcing these things upon someone is never cool.", "Do you mean parents not wanting kids to share bed with a partner under their roof, or parents not wanting kids to have sex under their roof? Because those are two different things.", "Lol no. Please show me a post where parents are being scolded for not wanting to hear their child having loud sex.\n\nWhat parents do get criticized for is for (a) not letting partners sleep in the same bed or (b) being scandalized by the thought that sex *could* occur. And the reason why they're criticized is that the first is simply an extreme overreaction and that the second isn't an issue as long as everyone is discreet so the parents don't have to hear.\n\nOP's parents can continue to sleep in the same bed together. They can even continue to have sex together. They simply aren't allowed to be exhibitionists in OP's home who include OP in their sex life. This is a very different boundary.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/whyarethenamesgone1 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xr5u1/aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_either_stay_at_a/j7tuwvb/\n\nBot Reported.", "Just remember, every time you say \u201csurely there can\u2019t be X kink\u201d, you\u2019re super wrong.

It's her house too, isn't it?\"  Lol... Can't make the Internet happy. \n\nNow, most women I know would say, \"Okay.  If it makes you uncomfortable, I've got your back, Hon.\"  It's certainly what I would have said to my guy.   But he wouldn't have just ignored my thoughts on the matter - he values my opinion, even if we don't always agree, and it's my house, too.  \n\nOP and his wife disagreed on this.

And while I think 99% of Reddit gets what I mean I will spell it out for the nitpickers and the trolls: \n\nThe pattern overall described by OP sounds like emotional incest. The specific incident sounds like a part of that pattern and likely could be described in that way, as well as sexual abuse by proxy, amongst other things.\n\nI also said, \"it sounds like\". I am not a therapist/doctor. I would not presume to make an authoritative pronouncement on someone else's situation. \n\nI am an adult survivor of emotional incest.
