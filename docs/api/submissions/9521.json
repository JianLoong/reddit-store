Not the same thing at all.  I know this is shocking, but you can sleep in the same room with someone and NOT have sex.", "Which is why I said that telling them their volume is a problem is perfectly reasonable.  Skipping straight to \u201cdon\u2019t have sex\u201d isn\u2019t.", "Agree, hence why I think the parents also suck. \n\nBut I think OP should have gone in - at least at first - with asking them to be quiet before trying to control when they have sex, if at all.\n\nLike parents aren\u2019t being respectful of the house and necessary conditions, but OP\u2019s response as they describe it here goes beyond trying to correct that and what\u2019s actually wrong (the noise) and into just being a disgusted reaction to the very fact that their parents have sex.", "Excellent response!", "It is the exact same logic used for weddings all the time.  The groom's opinions have no value at all.  He is just supposed to agree to whatever the wife wants.  There is a word for men who do that.  I think it starts with an S.", "We are living in the ME generation.  Screw everyone else, so to speak.", "Is this why the comedy is so self-deprecating and uncomfortable? A country grappling with its decline as a world power? Don\u2019t get me wrong I think the comedy is hilarious, but it could explain a lot.", "Yep, could you imagine if the wife was the one who was uncomfortable, and the husband told her to just suck it up?  The pitchforks would be out for that husband.", "Yup, I remember those days too. Thank goodness my friends\u2019 parents loved having me over, so I could escape for their weekend escapades (usually twice in the night with a nooner for fun).", "I don't think asking them to limit themselves to the eleven hours a day I'm not home is a big ask.", "And if they had been quiet, he wouldn\u2019t have known in the first place, would he? Or you know, they could not go after each other like a couple of 18 year olds that need to screw every day/night.", "Don't have sex \"while I'm home\".", "But he doesn't quite say that, just not to when he's about.\n\nIt is his home. Don't think he's the asshole for wanting to be comfortable in his home.", "Another way for me not to hear it would be for them to do it when I'm not home.", "Exactly, everyone would say \u201che\u2019s toxic\u201d \u201che doesn\u2019t consider your feelings\u201d \u201crun away\u201d", "It sure isn\u2019t.", "I mean they\u2019re a married couple who had sex, as far as we know, on one occasion. How is that going after each other like nymphomaniacs? And even if they *do* - literally who cares? 18 year olds don\u2019t have the embargo on libido lol. \n\nThey should have been quiet but they probably didn\u2019t know OP could hear, and instead of giving them the opportunity to change and be respectful OP has offered that they can either leave (which they\u2019ve done, by the way) or not have sex, or only have sex when OP isn\u2019t home (???) \n\nThis sub is hypocritical - how many posts do we see of going couples going to stay with their parents complaining about harsh rules and we say they\u2019re two consenting adults, but now because it\u2019s an older couple everyone is so disgusted.", "Yes but that is \n\n1) a slightly odd compromise as presumably you\u2019re not home during the day? I imagine it might be slightly uncomfortable for your parents, and wife, for them disappear in the middle of the day to have sex and be worried about when you\u2019re returning home like naughty teenagers and not a married couple in their fifties.\n\n2) still you placing restrictions on *when* they can have sex, which is overstepping *in my opinion.* \n\nThe issue here is *not* that your parents have sex. The issue is is that they\u2019re not being respectful of other people\u2019s right not to hear it, and their right to sleep. That\u2019s the sum total of what you\u2019re asking for them. The solution is not to tell them *when* (or where, or how) they can have sex, like it\u2019s some kind of shameful secret, but rather to ensure they\u2019re doing it respectfully.", "I\u2019m highly doubting they were \u201cjust\u201d loud enough to be heard. They were likely orchestral in their performance. And that is highly disturbing. \n\nJust out of curiosity, how often have you heard your parents? Like a once in a blue moon when they\u2019re extra frisky, or were they \u201csex positive\u201d like OP\u2019s?", "They can have all the sex they want all night long at a hotel.", ">I\u2019m highly doubting they were \u201cjust\u201d loud enough to be heard. They were likely orchestral in their performance. And that is highly disturbing.\n\nWhy do you think this is likely? I would argue it\u2019s extremely unlikely that this was the case if OP\u2019s wife; by OP\u2019s own reckoning someone easy to embarrass - who\u2019s just birthed a newborn - thought it was fine and OP\u2019s reaction was over the top. \n\n>Just out of curiosity, how often have you heard your parents? Like a once in a blue moon when they\u2019re extra frisky, or were they \u201csex positive\u201d like OP\u2019s?\n\nThis is a really weird and invasive thing to ask, no? But I\u2019ve never *heard* my parents, although my mother has certainly tried to talk to me about their sex life on a handful of occasions in a misguided attempt to be relatable. If I were to hear them I would certainly ask them to keep it down. But I wouldn\u2019t kick them out of the house or try and control when and where they have sex. *That\u2019s* disturbing, in my opinion.", "Or at your brother\u2019s house, apparently, which is where they\u2019ve gone. Are you so disgusted by the fact your parents have sex that you\u2019re willing to die on this hill? \n\nMaybe listen to your wife and think about the effect this might have on your parents\u2019 relationships with you *and* your burgeoning family before you decide to go nuclear over this. \n\nIf your parents can agree to be quiet and respectful - where is the issue?", "Yeah, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, so your opinion counts for naught. The fact you keep pushing your uninformed opinions so hard (on multiple threads here) shows how much you need to learn. \n\nUntil you\u2019ve spent years losing sleep on a regular basis because your parents *NEED* to be loud, you won\u2019t get it. OP has had years of peace to suddenly have it invaded WITHOUT HIS CONSENT, he reacted very maturely.", "\"if\"", "Lol where does it say OP lost sleep on a regular basis growing up due to this? \n\nAnd if he did surely he\u2019d have asked them to be quiet when they arrived at the house? \n\nAnd his wife and brother *and* parents all think he\u2019s being absurd. \n\nI hope you only ever offer opinions on things you\u2019ve lived exactly - or you\u2019re a massive hypocrite!", "Literally just ask them to be quiet. If they can\u2019t, that\u2019s when you review other options such as asking them to stay elsewhere. Not for a first offence.\n\nAnd also if your wife who\u2019s just birthed a newborn wasn\u2019t bothered at all I have to query how loud they were actually being."]}
