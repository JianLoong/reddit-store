I don\u2019t complain or ask him to get off, I pay for all the food in the house, pay the power/water/TV/internet/phone, do all the grocery shopping, cook and clean. His one chore is to mow the lawn.\nYesterday around noon after I had gotten up, made coffee and breakfast, did the dishes and the laundry I asked \u201cdo you mind mowing today\u201d\u2026. This is after I brought him his coffee and breakfast in bed while he gamed on his phone for a few hours. He reply\u2019s \u201cyea\u201d so I\u2019m thinking \u201cgreat\u201d!! It\u2019s summer and it\u2019s been 3 weeks, it needed to be done. \nSo a couple hours go by and he hasn\u2019t moved, so instead of nagging him I went to the shed and got out the mower and stared on the front yard. I finished back and front, took me about an hour because it\u2019s a push mower and a descent size yard. \nI came in and he was angry so I asked if he was ok, he preceded to yell at me and to not touch his f-ing mower ever again. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. It\u2019s been really uncomfortable and I feel like I\u2019m not the asshole. But I could be wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
