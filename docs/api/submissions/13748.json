Your sister clearly doesn\u2019t want this union to take place. She has opposed it publicly multiple times. Why in the hell would she *want* to be there? Your doing everyone a favor. She doesn\u2019t need to participate as a witness of your love to your partner. And you and your future husband don\u2019t need to host a racist. \n\nTell your parents that you didn\u2019t, not-invite her. She excluded herself by her repeated words despite warnings.

With biracial children, that might mean some have darker skin than the others, etc. \n\nThen the children start catching on as to why they are excluded or treated differently than their siblings.

But given that's she's going to be your sister and his sister in law for a long time, it might be worth having one last session with her. Explain how the things she said made you and him feel, and if she acknowledges and apologizes and supports the marriage let her come. Of course if she reverts after the wedding you're under no obligation to keep forgiving her. \n\nYou're also justified in just saying no and not giving her one last chance.", "The height checks out.
