But know this. Because of he actions she will never be a part of our lives and that includes our children as she has made hers clear she is racist and if you back her, sweep it under the rug, ask me to forgive and forget then I will have to think long and hard on hiw much you will be involved as well. I refuse to allow any harm to come to my FH or kids that come from racist family members. \n\nBut that's me because them being mad is them more worried about their image then the problem which will get worse when kids get involved because If you think your sister won't say anything where they can hear.

Surely it will come as no surprise after comments like that", "NTA, your sister is racist, and your parents wanting you to suck it up and invite her is encouraging that behavior, both by the parents for being mad, and if you invited her by you, as this tells her she can treat people however she wants without consequences. Nip it in the bud and do not invite her, and tell your parents that you will not tolerate racist behavior", "NTA\nYour sister treats people of a different race as lesser.

Are your parents standing with your sister because she is your sister or because inside, they feel the same as she does about interracial marriage in general and your fianc\u00e9 in particular? You are not unfair, nor are you required to invite her to your wedding. She has been openly critical of your partner due to race even to the extent of suggesting you break up. Who's to say she won't continue in that vein at the wedding. Your parents can't guarantee that they can keep her in check, so she doesn't cause issue. This is your wedding. Those that do not support this marriage, do not need to be invited to witness it. Period.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would you want such an outspoken bigot at your wedding? Your parent are wrong on this.

Your day. Your say.\n\nNTA", "Your sister is a Bigot. I not only hope she doesn't go to the wedding but you keep her away from future children.
