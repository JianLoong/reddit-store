Your sister has never been supportive so she never should be there. Tell your parents to either get on board or they will get cut too. And have security there, which can be groomsmen or guests that sit by the door.

Why invite someone who openly disparages your fianc\u00e9? Are you & your fianc\u00e9 paying for the wedding or are your parents? If they are, it becomes trickier because they'd have some say in who comes to the wedding. If it comes down to it, just get married at the courthouse & have a party afterwards.

I've spoken to my mother about it and she has now apologised. It's tough because I have never forgotten what happened.
