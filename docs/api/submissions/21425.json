Maybe not technically against the rules but definitely it puts you in a difficult position and there MAY be expectations or rules in your contract or the housing terms about this. A reasonable response, to me, would be 'Sorry you can't stay with us Jim, but as we're living in school dormitory housing as part of my employment benefit I'm afraid it's just not an option.' \n\nIt seems like perhaps the bigger issue is you and your fiance not being on the same page.

The BIL's behavior could easily get you kicked out (my sister-in-law had a similar arrangement one summer and the rules were clear; no overnight guests without prior approval, one person was kicked out for violating that). Also, it's very rude of him to not even speak to you about it since your living space is provided by your job. It's a shared space, but in this case your fianc\u00e9 really should not have any say in it.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like BIL is known for taking advantage and this is a very reasonable boundary to set early.\n\nI will say it is very common practice in marriage for family to deal with the partner that is their blood relation so I think the communication issue is with your partner, not his family, and I'd recommend having a bigger, less heated conversation about how you'll handle these unexpected plans together next time and what you both need and expect from one another!", "ESH, \nYour fianc\u00e9 for inviting him.

You're entirely capable of calling Jim and sorting it out rather than sitting back getting more and more bent out of shape about it.", "ESH.

Because twice in your post you mentioned your main problem is that you\u2019ve only met Jim twice but you\u2019re completely outraged that he did not come to you directly with this request.

The people who are voting N T A seem to be focusing on this is related to your job etc.\u2026 But you expressed no such concern of anything like that so I am not giving you a pass on any of that as far as judgement consideration.  \n\nAnd yeah he\u2019s being a little vague but sometimes plans happen that way\u2026 You\u2019ve never gone to visit family and just had a loose plan of what you\u2019re doing and when? \n\nYou seem extremely high strung", "ESH.

He keeps changing his mind.  It's fine to let someone stay with you, but they can't be so wishy washy about it.  He needs to pick a date & stick to it.

Since the BIL knew all this, he should have asked her first since the fianc\u00e9 has zero say in the matter. Even if the school approves, she would be wise to tell him NO, because he's a stranger to her and all it would take is one student complaint about some creepy guy, and they are out the door and she's fired.

My fiance and I both were not down with that", "You'd be correct if it was a normal apartment. They are staying on campus as a perk of OPs job. It's a high school campus, so there are minors around, and the school will be fanatic about unknown adults staying overnight (my SIL had a similar job and at least one person was kicked out for overnight guests).

It's your job and reputation on the line; you could get kicked out for letting him stay there. Since your fianc\u00e9's brother knows that he's a total AH for not asking you and for being shifty about his plans. If your fianc\u00e9 is not supporting that 100%, then he's totally in the wrong. It's not his place, not his job, and not his reputation on the line, it's yours.

There are minors running around and the schools tend to take that violation VERY seriously.", "Oh gosh, I missed \"prep\" part of college prep. Yup, bunch of kids. This doubles  my resistance to letting the brother stay.", "It does matter, its campus housing provided as a job perk, not a regular apartment. Schools tend to be very picky about who stays on campus because there are minors around. The BIL is a total AH since he knows that and is being shifty about plans.

He\u2019s family.", "**I told my fiance that and he said \"yeah I understand, but when he comes without warning like this it's hard to say 'you have to leave after x nights'\".**\n\nDoes your fiance honestly not see the hilarious irony of that statement?  He's crashing at a place that's owned by your employer completely without warning.  Honestly it's overly generous to allow him two nights.  DO check with the school and see what the policy would be on you hosting an overnight guest BEFORE allowing BIL to stay even one night.", "NTA. Just because the family choose to tolerate Jim\u2019s bullshit doesn\u2019t mean you have to. You are doing him a favour, it\u2019s common courtesy.", "This is a disaster waiting to happen, because the minute BIL sets foot inside he isn't goi9ng anywhere UNTIL HE WANTS TO, WHICH COULD BE WHO KNOWS WHEN. \n\nThe whole thing is shady, anyway, because BIL or your partner or both are unclear about what exactly is going on.\n\nOne thing for sure is it is never good for you to show ambivalence or tolerance, etc. when your partner first mentions the idea. You have to get tough and defi8ne a zero-tolerance boundary, so he has no wiggle room. It's simply OH NO YOU WON'T, which will make it easier for him to relay the \"No, you can't\" news to his brother.\n\nDo you read much on this sub?

I feel as though Jim (who I have only met twice) cannot expect to just crash with us for as long as he wants, **especially without communicating with me at all.**\n\nI'm not entirely sure this is necessary from Jim, especially as you mentioned you've only met him twice. I understand Jim solely communicating with your husband on this. It's probably more comfortable for him, and it would be relayed to you by your husband. I think this is more on your husband here for not pushing to get concrete plans. That's my 2 cents.", "NTA. Your bf is Only getting these accommodations because of *your* job. Does BIL know this? Because if he does, he is really showing you a total lack of respect by not talking directly to you. Instead, he is acting like his brother has any say on whether he stays there. Nope.", "Definitely NTA. Agree that you and fianc\u00e9 need to have a conversation about the \u201crules\u201d of having houseguests. For example, neither of you can tell a guest \u2018yes\u2019 until you\u2019ve discussed it, you both have to agree on the length of time the guest stays, other boundaries for being in your home, etc. \n\nMy ILs invited themselves to our house for TEN DAYS the first Christmas after we were married, and obviously I\u2019m still not completely over it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\" he said \"yeah I understand, but when he comes without warning like this it's hard to say 'you have to leave after x nights'\"  \n\n\nFirst, No, it's not hard at all.  Second, tell him to stop coming without warning. \"Coming without warning means you're sleeping in your car, or in the woods or in a hotel, or anyplace else other than here. Period.\"  \n\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. I'd also go a step further and say that you should have a convo with your fiance about having family stay with you guys in general. Right now, the location is tied to the school and your career. But I think it's important to have this conversation in general because if your fiance is ok with having his brother (and other family members) stay with you two for indefinite time periods and is prioritizing them over you, that's something you should work out now instead of after you get married.", "What's also hard is trying to plan your schedule around someone who may or may not be there for an unspecified amount of time but you're not even sure because they're too inconsiderate to communicate specifics with their hosts.", "Exactly.  This isn\u2019t OP\u2019s house or space.  This is a college dorm.  \n\nPure speculation:  Why do I get the feeling that BIL is looking to scope out college girls?", "He's creepy and entitled. Have him Creep to a dorm titled HOTEL", "Even worse, they are staying at a high school campus, provided by the OPs job. With minors on campus, she'd be taking a huge risk to her job and career even if the school did allow it, which they almost certainly won't due to liability. One student comment about a creepy guy on campus late at night is all it would take...", "It's a high school/middle school campus, actually", "Are students around for summer programs?", "Yes - that's the program I am teaching in.", "My apologies but ohn. Last time I was an assistant on a daytime only program for a school, I had to get a full background check. I can\u2019t believe a program would be ok with this. \n\nThis is your job, career, and reputation.  A guy who can\u2019t bother communicating with you can stay with other family or in a hotel.  He doesn\u2019t get unlimited free range of your school\u2019s space.\n\nIf this was an off campus house it would be totally different.  But this has disaster written all over it. It sounds like you and your fiance have totally different goals and rules for this.  The game of telephone is going to bite you in the end. Blame your boss if you have to- but this just doesn\u2019t sound like a good idea to me."]}
