It's a shared space, but in this case your fianc\u00e9 really should not have any say in it.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like BIL is known for taking advantage and this is a very reasonable boundary to set early.\n\nI will say it is very common practice in marriage for family to deal with the partner that is their blood relation so I think the communication issue is with your partner, not his family, and I'd recommend having a bigger, less heated conversation about how you'll handle these unexpected plans together next time and what you both need and expect from one another!", "ESH, \nYour fianc\u00e9 for inviting him.

Right now, the location is tied to the school and your career.

Don't put your job on the line for someone who couldn't clearly communicate their plans with you.", "NTA and maybe check with the school before it happens>as you would hate to lose this position if it is a problem, specially with \"room and board\" Like how is he expecting to eat? will he go out for all meals? as he is not entitled to diddly squat!!", "I guess I would say in a way YTA because you haven\u2019t confirmed with the prep school if you are allowed to have overnight guests\u2026 I would have checked that first because chances are you can say he can\u2019t stay with you at all because I doubt the college is okay with it.", "\u201cIf this is a hard conversation for you to have with him then it might be easier to just tell him he can\u2019t stay here at all and he should look at a hotel.\u201d", "I totally agree, it would be a huge liability risk for any school to allow this since there are minors present, and even if they did allow it, a risk for the OP's job and career since she doesn't know the guy.", "High school, not college, so even less likely since there are minors there.", "Then definitely don't have fiance's brother stay over. Usually, at least where I work, schools are very selective with who can be around kids. I have submitted reference letters and done multiple police checks to even volunteer with kids. I'm not saying anything bad about fiance's brother but be wary of not bending the school rules.", "NTA - BUT you are putting your CAREER in jeopardy if you have an adult staying in your JOB-RELATED housing. You are not just liable. You will likely be in breach of contract, and that will mean bad references. Contact the head of your program with a \u201chypothetical\u201d guest situation. It is VERY possible they will say NO overnight guests on campus. Your fianc\u00e9 is being a pushover for fAMilYyyyy\u2026. And if he is willing to put your livelihood in jeopardy to keep his relatives happy, do you really want to marry him?", "Nta, you aren't obligated to be welcoming for an unspecified period.of time. Jim needs to get his shit together.", "NTA I am pretty sure over night guests are not allowed it\u2019s surprising that your fianc\u00e9 is allowed to live there.", "Yeah as others have said I'm not really sure this is your call at all: the school gave you a benefit (the lodging) but they may have requirements for behavior and a 'guest' policy.  No one seems to be thinking that this roof over your head? It's not really yours to extend to others.  You might, in fact, mess the whole thing up and either get kicked out early for drama, or never get hired there again. \n\nBro and your fiance need to realize what's at stake here. \n\nNTA", "He was keeping secrets from you. He was being vague on purpose and hoping you\u2019d just go with it. \n\nHe\u2019s not to be trusted and when his brother shows up, it\u2019ll be two against one on everything. \n\nSay you\u2019re not comfortable taking advantage of the school\u2019s accommodations by having any family members stay, especially not without thoroughly discussing it first. \n\nA fianc\u00e9 who goes straight to calling you uptight for not going along with their scheme is not\u2026I\u2019ll say ideal. \n\nNTA and YWNBTA if you alerted someone in charge to his plan. This affects your employment and going by the book is probably best.", "Check the policy. I\u2019m sure overnight guests are not allowed. They weren\u2019t when I was teaching and living onsite.", "NTA. But immediately find out the policy and then in no way violate it. Your career and reputation would be on the line.  \nThen if your fiance is still unhappy and acts immature about it, you have a big red flag fiance problem that you will need to pay close attention to.", "This is the way.\n\nSurvival tip from one teacher to another: make the bureaucracy do your dirty bidding in every possible situation.", "Also? Actually, it's not hard to say how long he can stay when he's being vague. Just tell him straight up \"you stay for x amount of time.\" Full stop.", "Since it's a high school with minors around, it's almost certain they'll say no. Even if by some miracle they say yes, the OP is still risking her job and career... all it would take is one student commenting \"a creepy guy on campus scared me last night\".", "I think you are a bit \u201cpower tripping\u201d\u2026"]}
