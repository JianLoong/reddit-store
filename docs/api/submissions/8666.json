What a horrifying thing to say to another human.", "Totally agree with this comment! \n\nJust one thing I want to point out because many people don't realize how predatory the adoption industry is, at least in the US. In (way too) many cases, \"open adoptions\" aren't legally binding and can't actually be enforced. So bio parents could sign adoption paperwork with the promise of regular contacts, visits, pictures, updates, etc., then after the adoption is finalized, the agency or adoptive parents can tell them to fuck off and cut all communication between them and the child.\n\n20 states in the US have no laws regarding open adoption agreements. 6 states have laws specifically in place that make open adoption agreements **unenforceable**. 7 states have laws that make open adoption enforceable, but only under certain circumstances. (Those circumstances include things like age of the child, whether or not the child lived with bio parents before adoption, if adoption is done through foster care or if the child is adopted by step-parents). The rest have laws making open adoption enforceable as long as the court agrees it's in the child's best interest. \n\nAnd some of those laws were put in place just over the past few years. It's a sad reality, but unfortunately OPs fiance's birth mother *could have* placed her with her adoptive parents with the promise and expectation that she would have some sort of contact with her throughout her life only to be cut off once a judge signed off on it. In fact, some states keep adoption records sealed forever and adoptees CAN'T access info on birth parents, even when necessary for medical history.\n\nThe way OP villainizes her bio parents and parents who place their children for adoption in general is gross and speaks to a major lack of empathy and understanding. Especially for the woman he \"loves\" enough to marry. Some adoptions happen in cases where the parents very much love their children and want to raise them but can't and the choice is out of their hands. (For example, if a single parent is injured badly and hospitalized indefinitely and the other parent is dead/can't be found and there are no relatives to care for their child(ren), CPS will place them in foster care. The timeline differs from place to place but in some states, once a child has been in foster care for 6 months, they're eligible for adoption.)

You can combine this testing with other testing to check for whether either of you carry any genetic disorders.\n\nThis is exactly right. If you're looking for someone to have children with, genetic testing is a no-brainer for avoiding painful, life shattering consequences later. Any fertility clinic should be able to either order the test or do it themselves.
