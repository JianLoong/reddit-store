Like I said if it was my friend I would respect her wishes.", "Yeah I tried to make it clear. But once she disregarded my initial request I got triggered and kind of kept interrupting her so she shut down and hasn't said anything else about it.", "Honestly if it came down to it, I would. I love her with all my heart but my daughter is my life.", "Thank you for this. I realized how aggressive I got about the situation, but it triggered me when she showed up at our door. She did try to talk about it but once I realized she wasn't ok with how I felt I did keep cutting her off which I know was my bad. Then she just stopped talking about it. I will take your advice to heart", "I will do what I have to to protect her, but I don't want to take my daughter from her. I'm just hoping she's not going to follow through and will use better judgement but the fact that she didn't right away acknowledge and respect my views on the matter worries me.", "She can't guarantee that though. Perhaps she could have constant supervision if she let's her friend see the baby, but would she be able to keep an eye on her friend the whole time?

And generally influenced you to do bad things, wants to go walking with you and child. Ask her if she'd feel safe, and if it's because she didn't trust you that she was unsafe or was it because you didn't like your child even being with such a person. \n\nIf she'd want to be friends with this person so bad maybe you can join a few times.", "That's my point. What if she has to use the bathroom. A lot could happen in a short time. Don't get me wrong. She is a great mother and I know how much she loves our daughter. And even if she didn't directly do something to our child, she's not the kind of person I want my daughter around in general. I feel like it's not too much to ask.", "Honestly if the situation progresses I will be looking into couples therapy. \n\nThat's also the thing. I don't know why she wants to be friends with her so bad when all she's ever talked about was how terrible of a friend she was. I think she just misses having a friend because she is a stay at home mom and I work full time. And I'm completely cool with that, except this situation when it involves my daughter. Even though I feel like she's a bad influence", "Absolutely it's not too much to ask. It's not like you're saying to give up on the friendship. Just keep the known child abuser away from your child. If her friend has grown or changed, then she would absolutely be understanding of that judgment call. It's honestly mind-boggling that your wife would want to let this person around yalls kid. Good luck OP.", "I almost became friends with the girl who tried to SA me(got on top and kissed bit didn't get further) just to make sure her bf(who was my ex for 4 months at the time, not only that but my first bf) constantly got me in shit, and talked bad about me to anyone who would listen. I think it's a trauma response, or I have this thing where I almost go back to the bad life I had because I kinda had a bad life... and sometimes my brain tries to bring me back. I don't have kids, but it would've hurt me more than benifit. She's doing much better after being hospitalized, but it was better for me to cut contact after the initial \"I'm sorry, let's make amends\". I'm glad I don't hate her, I try not to hate anyone, but she doesn't need to be in my life.", "Thanks. And to be honest if I was around her and I saw that maybe she was a different person now, with enough time maybe we could get to that point. But right now I'm just not comfortable with the idea.", "I can understand that. And I'm not telling her she can't be her friend. Just don't bring her around my baby. I don't understand why she doesn't get it", "This is what you tell her. You'd only heard negative comments. You got scared, take some time to see what becomes of the friendship, without your child involved.", "nta. you need to break it down. like \"do you really want the woman who abuses children, does drugs, hangs around strange men and is an all around bad influence around our daughter?\" the fact that shes willing to put your guys child in danger is concerning. that woman is not safe and you need to make your fiance see that. would she be okay with your child being alone with said friend? would she be okay with your daughter having a friend like her? If there's even a bit of hesitation in answering that, that's the answer, no, shes not safe. Honestly this would make me reconsider the relationship, especially if shes still adamant on it.", "It\u2019s bizarre how your fianc\u00e9 would respect anyone person who would do that to babies\u2026 whilst being someone who has a baby. \nIf I were in her she\u2019s hearing these stories form this woman, I would be distancing myself and family from her\u2026 why does your fianc\u00e9 crave this woman\u2019s friendship? You\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s my that you don\u2019t trust your fianc\u00e9, her arugula r is moot. But you don\u2019t trust the friend and perhaps even your fianc\u00e9s judgment at this time. She\u2019s teetering a risk for your child and is she willing to wait until  something happens and then react surprised and upset? That\u2019s silly", "Maybe the friend has changed but you are definitely right to want to keep your child away from that.\n\nIs there a compromise that you can come to with your fianc\u00e9? Like maybe the friend only comes over when both of you are home so someone can always have an eye on your little one? Or that you guys can set aside time that your fianc\u00e9 can go visit this friend without your child? \n\nI 100% see your side of it but I also slightly see her side of it and maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m recently out of a long term relationship that was very controlling towards the end. He had to \u201capprove\u201d my friends and when I was and wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to them and always wanted to know exactly what we talked about, where we went, what was said to my kids and so on\u2026 so maybe just try having a calm conversation with her and see if you can come up with some ideas that you are both comfortable and hopefully that will help. But also maybe ask her if she would be comfortable if some of those stories were about her daughter instead of other children and let her think about that for a little bit.", "NTA\n\n\"You have told me nothing by horrible stories about this person, told me how she has blown smoke in a babies face to stop it crying.\n\nCan you tell me one positive story about here, where she did something nice for anyone?\n\nIf it was OUR child that she blew smoke in its face, would you ever allow her around again?\"", "NTA.

Like the way your wife described her \"friend\", why would anyone in their right mind take them back into their life.

Had my ex tried this once and I called CPS on him.", "NTA. A few thoughts:\n\n1. It is really sad that your wife wants to resume a 'friendship' with such a toxic person. Is she maybe feeling more isolated than you are? Does she need more opportunities to spend time with her sisters or other friends or to meet new people that she could build friendships with. I wonder if you are happy with the three of you just staying in the house all the time, and you are missing that your wife really wants more connection with others. Honestly, I think you need to ask your wife if she's missing something in her life and ask to truly understand why she wants to be with this old friend who has such a toxic track-record.\n2. It also says something about your wife that she ever kept this person as a friend through all the horrible behavior that your wife witnessed.\n3. An approach that served my husband and me very well over the years: If one of us has a concern that the other doesn't share. we both agree to follow the less risky path. There's a strong basis for your concerns. Even if your wife feels like she can protect your child from whatever her bada$$ friend might bring up, you would rather not risk even the possibility. So - wife gets to choose to hang out with her friend AWAY FROM YOUR HOME and WITHOUT YOUR CHILD if that is what she wants.\n4. It gives you both time to get more information. Time is needed to determine whether the friend has truly changed. To see what kind of activities/situations she and your wife will end up in when they are together and what your wife does about unsafe situations. If the void your wife is trying to fill can be filled a better way....", "Child abusers aren't welcome in my life. I'd be side eyeing my gf for wanting to spend time with this woman again.

Which you put a stop to by saying your daughter should never be around her 'friend'.\n\n NTA don't back off.\n\nA suggestion : google cases of CPS removing children from parents who have been endangering children by letting people on drugs/drunk / in possession of drugs etc around them and show your fiancee", "To her, it is about her parenting vigilance, not about the friend. That's why. I do get her, I might react like she did, but ultimately, you are in the right.", "Cutting someone off doesn\u2019t give way to open communication. Your point is 100% correct but if you didn\u2019t effectively communicate it.
