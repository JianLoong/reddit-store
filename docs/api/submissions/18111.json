We have a one year old daughter. Neither of us really have friends besides each other due to just kind falling off with people as we got older. She has sisters who she will talk to and hang out with. I spend most of my time working or with her and my daughter.\n\nRecently an old lifelong friend of hers that was estranged showed up at our door and they spent a few hours catching up. She's told me a lot about this woman. Everything she's ever said has been bad. About how bad of a friend she was. She only ever hit her up when she needed something. How she would talk shit about her. About how she would get them into dangerous situations ( weird parties, strange men, etc). This woman has a child and my fiancee told me how she would have strange men over and let them bully her son. She's big into drugs and partying (at least she was before). My fiancee told me a story about her blowing weed smoke in a friend's Babys face because the baby was crying. Well she recently had another baby as well. \n\nI told my fiancee I don't care if they talk or whatever but I don't want her around my baby. She got offended and said if she wants to meet up with her and take them on a walk she will do it. She thinks I don't trust her to keep our baby safe. Now we are fighting because I'm obviously triggered that she won't respect my wishes because if it was the other way around and one of my friends made her uncomfortable I wouldn't bring my daughter around them. \n\nNot only has she told me all of these terrible stories, but I know they used to do hoodrat shit together and this chick is a bad influence.

If you were to allow that person around your kid, that would make you the AH.

I read some of your responses.

Walking into this like she's too stubborn to listen will only make her feel like you don't care about what she has to say.\n\nEven if you don't agree with her, hear what she has to say. Let her feel heard. Don't just listen, *let her feel heard.*\n\nYou have every right to be concerned and protective of your daughter. This old \"friend\" has a history of harming babies and, more importantly, harming your wife. You're NTA for putting your foot down, but you need to work on communication with your wife.

Stand your ground!!!", "That's what I have been trying to explain. And I'll admit I came off strongly about it because i am adamant that this will not happen and I want her know my stance on it. She's a very stubborn woman. She seems to think if she's there that nothing would happen and I should trust that.", "Yeah I really don't understand why she doesn't see my point of view. Like I said if it was my friend I would respect her wishes.", "Yeah I tried to make it clear. But once she disregarded my initial request I got triggered and kind of kept interrupting her so she shut down and hasn't said anything else about it.", "Honestly if it came down to it, I would. I love her with all my heart but my daughter is my life.", "Thank you for this. I realized how aggressive I got about the situation, but it triggered me when she showed up at our door. She did try to talk about it but once I realized she wasn't ok with how I felt I did keep cutting her off which I know was my bad. Then she just stopped talking about it. I will take your advice to heart", "I will do what I have to to protect her, but I don't want to take my daughter from her. I'm just hoping she's not going to follow through and will use better judgement but the fact that she didn't right away acknowledge and respect my views on the matter worries me.", "She can't guarantee that though. Perhaps she could have constant supervision if she let's her friend see the baby, but would she be able to keep an eye on her friend the whole time? What if she needs to use the bathroom or something? That's a lot of effort to go through for something that, honestly, shouldn't even happen in the first place.", "Hey man, that's great. Self-reflection is always good, and it shows \n\n1) You're not a bad guy, just someone who made a mistake\n\n2) You are capable of recognizing mistakes and apologizing. Humility feels shitty, but it makes you a better person, and you're already there anyhow.\n\nGood luck moving forward. Mistakes happen, and that's okay. They don't decide who you are; how you react to them is who you are.", "I agree not to jump to removel of your daughter. \nWould maybe a therapist, possibly a relationship one, would be possible?\n \nThat way, you can bring up the things that happened in the past, and the worry you have for your daughter?\nMaybe they can explain your thoughts better.\n\nOr maybe you can sit down together and try \"look, I'm not doing this because I don't trust you, and I'm not doing it to be rude, but just hear me out\" mention you have a friend, you guys were always together, but he always shits on you, harmed babies including his own. And generally influenced you to do bad things, wants to go walking with you and child. Ask her if she'd feel safe, and if it's because she didn't trust you that she was unsafe or was it because you didn't like your child even being with such a person. \n\nIf she'd want to be friends with this person so bad maybe you can join a few times.", "That's my point. What if she has to use the bathroom. A lot could happen in a short time. Don't get me wrong. She is a great mother and I know how much she loves our daughter. And even if she didn't directly do something to our child, she's not the kind of person I want my daughter around in general. I feel like it's not too much to ask.", "Honestly if the situation progresses I will be looking into couples therapy. \n\nThat's also the thing. I don't know why she wants to be friends with her so bad when all she's ever talked about was how terrible of a friend she was. I think she just misses having a friend because she is a stay at home mom and I work full time. And I'm completely cool with that, except this situation when it involves my daughter. Even though I feel like she's a bad influence", "Absolutely it's not too much to ask. It's not like you're saying to give up on the friendship. Just keep the known child abuser away from your child. If her friend has grown or changed, then she would absolutely be understanding of that judgment call. It's honestly mind-boggling that your wife would want to let this person around yalls kid. Good luck OP.", "I almost became friends with the girl who tried to SA me(got on top and kissed bit didn't get further) just to make sure her bf(who was my ex for 4 months at the time, not only that but my first bf) constantly got me in shit, and talked bad about me to anyone who would listen. I think it's a trauma response, or I have this thing where I almost go back to the bad life I had because I kinda had a bad life... and sometimes my brain tries to bring me back. I don't have kids, but it would've hurt me more than benifit. She's doing much better after being hospitalized, but it was better for me to cut contact after the initial \"I'm sorry, let's make amends\". I'm glad I don't hate her, I try not to hate anyone, but she doesn't need to be in my life.", "Thanks. And to be honest if I was around her and I saw that maybe she was a different person now, with enough time maybe we could get to that point. But right now I'm just not comfortable with the idea.", "I can understand that. And I'm not telling her she can't be her friend. Just don't bring her around my baby. I don't understand why she doesn't get it", "This is what you tell her. You'd only heard negative comments. You got scared, take some time to see what becomes of the friendship, without your child involved."]}
