My best friend has known me since we were 12 so she has known my brother since he was 10, she has seen him grow up and he considers her a sister. When she came over this weekend, Saturday to Sunday, she was weirdly touchy feely with him (even he noticed) but I didn\u2019t think anything of it and now everything from the past four years is clicking in my head. Since she has dropped this bomb on me I told her I am super uncomfortable and that is allowed to feel her feelings but this is just out of no where. Mind you, my brother has a girlfriend and he can barely tolerate my best friend so nothing would EVER happen but she still decided to tell me. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my best friend that this is just weird and uncomfortable for many involved? Where do we go from here?\n\nUPDATE: okay totally understand my choice of words were very, very poor. Our whole friendship has been a sisterhood to us and even our families view us as their extra children so it\u2019s just uncomfortable for my brother and myself. I understand people are allowed to have feelings like this especially since she has been around him for so long but telling me now after keeping it in for so long is just uncomfortable.", "created_utc": 1677781017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g9pc1/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_that_her_being_in/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So any childhood friends who enter into a relationship are committing borderline incest? That\u2019s absurd. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s not even her childhood friend. It\u2019s her friend\u2019s brother. Ridiculous. You don\u2019t have to like it, but comparing to incest is just asinine.", "YTA.\n\nIt's literally not incest. You can be uncomfortable with it; that's fine, but it is *not incest*.", "YTA.\n\nEven if your friend is creepy, it's not \"borderline incest\".  Ridiculous to equate criminal sexual abuse with this.\n\nIf you are really friends, don't be hurtful.  Say to her, \"I understand, he's great - but he has a girlfriend and I'm concerned his not interested in you, so be careful you don't get hurt.\"  Done.\n\nIf she is inappropriate or terrible, first encourage him to handle it.  If she can't contain her touchy hands, ask her to stop and then evaluate if you're friends.", "YTA. You also don't know the meaning of the word \"borderline\".", "it sounds like she has some boundary issues with your brother, but you're making this weird in a really unreasonable way.\n\nthey are not related, there is no \"borderline incest\" except in your head.  and it's pretty gross.\n\nYTA", "YTA - work through your feelings about this. It's not incest at all", "YTA. \n\nYou are allowed to feel uncomfortable about it but she hasn't done anything wrong. And there is zero incest involved.", "YTA for how you said it. Feeling uncomfortable about it is one thing(sounds like your brother is too) but it\u2019s literally not incest. Don\u2019t call it that, it just sounds foolish.", "What? YTA. That\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s not like they even grew up in the same house together! She\u2019s YOUR friend and honestly attraction and eventual dating of your friend\u2019s sibling is pretty common and normal.", "Your brother has a girlfriend, that would be the no go part of this. This is not incest YTA.", "It's not at all incest, YTA", "YTA. In no way is this borderline incest. Your friend can't help her feelings, and you could have been more kind when she told you. I get that it's weird for you but I don't know. Your reaction just seems dramatic.", "Esh  - not what incest means. And I actually married my best friends brother lol", "YTA but just a little one for labeling your friends feelings  as borderline incest. Your Best friend can like whoever she wants to, she is an adult. For the sake of your brother though, I would advise you to talk to her and set some boundaries. If she didn't listen then limit the chances that she can actually see your brother.", "YTA \n\nWhat a foolish sentiment.", "YTA. It\u2019s not even close to incest, it\u2019s just somewhat awkward and uncomfortable. I understand that your because you and your friend are so close, she feels like extended family at this point but just because you feel something doesn\u2019t make it reality. What\u2019s disturbing is that your brother is in a relationship and your friend is making it known that she has feelings for him. That\u2019s not appropriate. You need to set a boundary by telling her that you won\u2019t entertain discussions about her feelings for your brother and she needs to respect his relationship by keeping herself when she\u2019s around him.", "ESH - It is NOT incest. Her attraction may not be reciprocated, but that is a totally different issue. YTA because you diminish actual incest and the people who do go through it (usually non-consensually). \n\nWe all go through \"crushes\" or attractions that are not reciprocated. It's a part of life. This, too, shall pass. But she's doing things that he doesn't like and doesn't want, so she's also being an AH. It may destroy your friendship if she doesn't let it go.", "ESH she should not be 'super touchy feely' with your brother, particularly when he is already in a relationship with someone else.\n\nhowever, that is not what incest means. you can be uncomfortable and unsupportive of the idea of them dating, but they're not related, so it's not incest.", "YTA, and you are being completely ridiculous. Not wanting your friend to date your brother is not the same as criminal behavior. C'mon now.", "yta", "YTA\n\nThis doesn't resemble incest AT ALL. What a weird and gross accusation. She should be respectful of his relationship, but that's not what you're concerned about.", "Inappropriate at 10 and 12 is irrelevant at 20 and 22.  I understand you find it uncomfortable and your brother isn't interested.  Perhaps the person you should be talking to is your friend to find out why she decided to share this with you now.  This is below the threshold for being deemed asshole behavior on any side.", "YTA, but the situation isn't great. That's a very strong choice of words to tell your best friend and you could have gone about it better. But the situation does put you, your brother, and honestly your brother's girlfriend if she found out, in a very awkward position. It sounds like both she and you need some time to process.", "\ud83e\udd74 get a grip.", "YTA. You need a dictionary. You being in love your brother would be incestuous behavior. Her, no. Not even close.", "YTA incest how???? she does have boundary issues but wtf do you mean incest", "I'm gonna say ESH, except your brother; you're TA for comparing this to incest, which it clearly isn't, and you might need some help working through your feelings on that (if this is something that's really bothering you).\n\nYour friend is also TA for flirting with somebody who's already in a relationship, and her behaviour is (I'm assuming) making your brother feel uncomfortable. \n\nThis feels like a situation where you all need to sit down, talk, and set your boundaries from here on out, otherwise you could end up with more awkward encounters in the future.", "In today\u2019s news: childhood friends cannot fall in love because its incest. YTA and in need of therapy", "I married my best friend's brother 48 years ago, both families were overjoyed.", "ESH.\n\nYour choice of words was totally inappropriate. \nYou were honest with your friend about how you feel with this situation but I don't think this is about your feelings. She needs to get over it, since your brother is already in a relationship.", "I'm going to go with NAH.  I don't think you're the AH, but you're also wrong. \n\nShe's not the AH for having feelings for someone she's spent a lot of time around. \n\nAnd, they're not related.  Now, if it makes your brother feel uncomfortable, that's probably a conversation he needs to have with her, but I don't think anyone is an AH here.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop letting your jealousy make you an AH.", "NTA", "Of course, you're not the asshole for telling your friend how you feel about the situation. Your friend is being a little creepy, wouldn't you say? I mean, lusting after your brother for four years? That's just messed up. And then trying to get touchy-feely with him when he has a girlfriend? That's just disrespectful.\n\nBut hey, it's not your fault your friend's got a thing for your brother. You can't control what other people feel, right? You did the right thing by telling her how you feel, though. That's the first step towards figuring out where to go from here.\n\nAs for where you go from here, that's up to you and your friend to figure out. You could try to talk it out and see if there's any way to salvage the friendship. Or, if you're too uncomfortable with the whole thing, you could just cut ties and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We have the same last name now and our kids are cousins- it's fun. I've been married 6 years longer than she has- so I tease her about being the one that made it weird. \n\n But the reality is two adults who spent a lot of time together fell in love and we got to make the \"sister\" relationship official. I have an automatic ally when the in-laws are driving me nuts, and holidays and reunions are guaranteed to be more fun.
