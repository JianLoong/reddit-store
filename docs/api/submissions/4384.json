Anne hates my mom. My siblings and I do not regard Anne as our parent because we were 11, 12 and 14 when we met her and when our dad married her. Now, there's some history to be explored before we get into the specific incident.\n\nDad used the time my siblings and I were with mom to build his relationship with Anne and eventually, her son. They were practically engaged before we met her and we met her son at their engagement party. They moved in the very next day and they were married two months later. We were equal time spent with mom and dad. But because of our ages and them being so new to us we did not get super close to Anne or her son in that time. Anne's son ended up diagnosed with a form of cancer that was more likely due to a longer term medical condition he was born with. Anne was away a lot with her son to get him treatment and she was with him out of state in one of the big Children's Hospitals where they specialize in cancers. Mine and my siblings life carried on as normal for the most part. When we were with mom life was totally normal.\n\nAnne's son died while we were on vacation with our mom. We were 17, 15 and 14 at the time. Anne was furious that mom took us. She had wanted us to stay because her son had wanted more time with us but mom had already booked the vacation and we still wanted to go. We were not close to Anne's son and we didn't have a familial bond with him. Anne never got over it and was especially bitter because we were not closer to her after and because most of us chose mom's house over dad's for staying at when we finished high school and wanted to come home. She was resentful that we weren't rallying around her and letting her still feel like a parent.\n\nNow I'm getting married. Anne despises my mom more than ever and when she heard I was doing a mother-son dance at my wedding, she told me she wanted to do one too and deserved to do one if I was doing something with \"that woman\". I told her \"that woman\" is my mom and I wanted to dance with her. I told her we (dad's wife and I) would not be dancing together. She asked how I could say that to her when she lost her only biological child and we didn't give her the chance to continue being a parent. I told her it was not my job. She said it was like she was a stranger, like we weren't family. I told her if she wanted us to be closer she should have made sure dad introduced us all before they were ready to get engaged but we never built up the relationship before they were married and we were all a little older when they did and not there all the time. She told me I was breaking her heart saying no to her and how could I be so thoughtless after what she's lost. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670673743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhqwju/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_shes_not_going_to/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very sad that her son died. It is no your job to replace him or to make her feel like a parent. The way she speaks of your mom is incredibly disrespectful and certainly won't make you feel closer to her. You do not owe her a mother-son dance and she is being incredibly entitled to demand it. She is also delusional if she thinks you have a close enough relationship to warrant it.", "NTA\n\nSorry for Anna's loss, but you are not her son's replacement. Moreover, she should not be that bitter about you wanting to spend your time with your actual mother.", "NTA.  Your dad\u2019s wife is using the death of her child to emotionally blackmail you.", " NTA\n\nWhile Anne losing a son is the worst thing that can happen as a parent, you are not responsible for her feelings. Sadly her and your dad's mismanagement of the introduction (you had 2 strangers move into your house) and other situations over which you had no choice or control over meant you never became close.\n\nEven if you had a good relationship with her as a step parent you would still not be required to have a mum - son moment with her.\n\nHer resentment of your mother and her lack of understanding of you and your siblings perspectives make her T A rather than N A H. Even if she hates your mum, she should have enough control over her emotion to be neutral to you about her\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding", "Let\u2019s get this straight, YOUR wedding is not about HER. And it\u2019s certainly not about her because she\u2019s jealous your mom is still a mom", "NTA. You never had a relationship what did she expect", "Step mom here.  NTA.  She should never say a bad word about your mom.  EVER.  And she should respect that the bond you have with your mom will always be different/special. My first thought is it seems to have more with trying to stick it to your mom and for attention than her feelings towards you.  I am sorry she is choosing to pull this shit with your wedding.  She is adding to the shitty step mom reputation unfortunately.", "NTA. I realize not inviting her would really rock the boat, but if she's this mean to your mom, I wouldn't risk a scene at the wedding and/or during your mother-son dance.", "You're NTA. She did nothing to build the relationship but now wants one of the perks. Too bad. She's lucky you even tolerate her considering the way she speaks about your mother.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. Who said anyone needs to dance with their mom AND step-mom if applicable? It doesn't sound like she would deserve one anyway if she has to demand one. If there were a good relationship before, it seems like she could have had a dance with you.", "NTA\n\nShe suffered a horrible loss but that\u2019s separate from the relationship she\u2019s had with you and your siblings. And who TF does she think she is referring to your mother as \u201cthat woman\u201d?? Awful. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA. You don't have the kind of relationship with her that would warrant you wanting to have a mother/son dance at your wedding and she knows it, so she shouldn't expect you to do it. Moreover, she's bringing up her dead son to try and emotionally manipulate you into caving to her demand for a dance. That's pretty bad on its own, but it's so much worse when you add in the jealousy she has of your mother. The \"that woman\" comment would have left me seething.", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, If she wanted a relationship with you, they should have worked harder at building one.\n\nPlus she is acting like a child. Regardless of what SHE thinks of your mum (and I bet she hates her due to feeling jealous and insecure) she should have the sense to know that YOU are close to your mum and she should be respectful about her to avoid hurting your feelings.\n\nBut she doesn't care about your feelings, only her own.\n\nIt is tragic that she lost her child, but you and your siblings are not a replacement, and its telling that she only really started trying after she lost him. She just wants to FEEL like a parent, but she has done nothing to earn that relationship. You cant NAKE people see you like a parent.\n\nYou're allowed to have a dance with whoever you want. Sone people enjoy very close relationships with their step parents, but that did not happen here. Since she's never stepped into a maternal role with you, it makes perfect sense that you dont want to indulge her with a dance and pretend she is on equal footing with your mother.\n\nIt sounds like that's what bothers her, the feeling of \"losing out\" to your mum.", "Skimmed it, but pretty obviously NTA. It's simple, Anne's not your mom. She doesn't *deserve* anything.", "NTA -  for one it is YOUR wedding and no one can tell you how to celebrate it. Second if she is openly that disrespectful to your biological mom you are completely in the right to deny this to her. In my eyes it would be an AH move towards your bio mom if you did do this.", "NTA. Someone else's demands are not your responsibility. She is not your mother but oddly enough your mother is. That's why you're doing a mother/son dance with her. She's lucky she's even getting invited.", "NTA. I do think that this is a really tragic situation because she wasn\u2019t able to develop any sort of relationship with you, because her kid was terminally ill.  It sounds like she wasn\u2019t present for a lot of i your relationship. I feel very badly for her because of what she went through. No parent should ever bury their child and the pain must be unimaginable. \n\nHer comment about your mom is totally wrong but I can also understand how she turned her grief into anger towards your mom for taking you away when he died. It\u2019s wrong to put that on you, and stick you in the middle of it. \n\nit sounds like she needs a massive amount of grief therapy. \n\nI think the real AH is your dad for rushing this marriage after you met. He was the one to choose how you integrated. So many parents believe their protecting their kids by withholding the meeting of the new SO. If this is the reason you\u2019re not close to her as you say, this kinda lies with him because it was his choice to make. He probably thought he was doing the right thing, but obviously he fucked up here. \n\nAnd Anne is also an AH for not being able to recognize that you don\u2019t have the relationship needed to have a \u2018mother\u2019/son dance. You can\u2019t be her surrogate son if the relationship isn\u2019t there.\n\nAll in all, a perfect storm of unfortunate, yet understandable, events that culminated to where you are today.", "Nta.

If there is no real relationship, there's no real reason for the dance. Just Bein married to a child's parent doesn't give you a relationship with that child. Heck, even being a parent doesn't mean a good relationship with your child. The relationship needs to be formed and molded with years of caring, communication, and being there for your child. She lost a child, which is very sad, but that doesn't mean she's owed a replacement, or that you have to take on that role.", "You're NTA for not wanting to dance with your step mother, but I feel like there is a lot of emotional trauma here that needs to be unpacked. It sounds like, as kids, you were put in an impossible 'mom versus the interloper' kind of situation (since your dad didn't really handle introductions all that well or slowly) and it's caused there to be a distance between you and your step mother. Compound that with her own grief and trauma over her son, and the weird 'transference' she seems to be trying to go for and the whole situation is just sad.\n\nYou don't 'owe' her anything and you're right that relationships take work from both parties - so you say she should have 'tried harder' but how hard did you and your siblings try? She was left alone to mourn her own child and that creates so much hurt - you already said she was bitter - but she was probably deeply deeply hurt. I know you were kids and kids don't think about people's feelings. Lack of maturity and all that, but you aren't kids any more. \n\nPerhaps you need to either consider family therapy, and explain to her how her hostility towards your mom is harming your relationship with her?\n\nYou also have an opportunity here to repair some of the damage here but I think there has been a lot of hurt and poorly handled step-family dynamics that you need to all share your feelings in a safe way. It sounds like you resent her and her son for 'invading' your life - you describe time without her as 'normal' implying that time with her is 'abnormal'.\n\nI think you all need counselling tbh. There has been too much that has gone on for this to be a straight up 'yes or no' AITA judgement. I don't think you're the AH for not wanting to do a 'mother son' dance - it's your wedding, but I think the underlying reasons for the request and your refusal are more complex and it wouldn't be right to brand your SM an AH in this scenario.", "Nta", "NTA. She\u2019s not your mother.", "NTA. Her reaction is so bizarre!\n\nEdit: also, what does your dad think about this?", "NTA.  You are not a replacement piece in the puzzle of her life.", "I think she expected that once we weren't hostile when we met her, that we would grow fast love for her and her son and wouldn't need to get to know them before living together and that she'd give him a fuller family. I think she still believes a love could have formed super fast and that I would see her as a parent/mother figure.", "When I said time with mom was normal, I mean it was. When Anne's son was sick things were not the same, because of course they weren't. Anne was either not there with her son and dad was on the phone to her most of the time after work or when they were there, the focus was on making her son comfortable, about needing to not make so much noise and stuff. We didn't have anything change at mom's during that time.", "I also have great sympathy for your step bro - he was probably very unhappy - between his own familial upheaval and suddenly having to live with 3 other siblings who were, at best, indifferent, and doing this while terminally ill as well, it sounds like he went through a rough time too. And that wasn't his fault any more than it was yours.", "Exactly - and that upheaval will have left lasting trauma on you and your siblings. This whole situation is very sad and was poorly handled from the start. I don't think it's fair to demonise your SM but her hostility towards your mom isn't helping her cause. I think you all need some family therapy because a lot of the damage runs deep here.", "It wasn't. I feel bad for the kid because he was 4 when we met him, but he knew our dad pretty much all his life, but never lived with him. Then suddenly he did and three older kids were there part time who didn't love his mom, didn't love him, didn't instantly regard him as family and were awkward with the set up before he got sick and then he was sick and was back and forth from a hospital in a different state. It was a lot for him.", "I don't think family therapy will do much because there's no love or family feeling on the part of my siblings and I. To me she's nothing more than my dad's wife and I don't have very strong feelings for her to try and make us more than we are at this point in time.", "Nta but it isn't about choosing sides man. Your dad messed up by rushing everything. How is she to you guys? Forget your mom, just you and your siblings.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is still with us, you're close to your mom, you dance with her, case closed.\n\nStepmom is a bitter AH trying to muscle in on your dance and make it about her.\n\nStepson-stepmom dances aren't really a thing at weddings...unless it's a unique case where the groom wants one.  I had a stepmom at my wedding, perfectly nice person, but no expectation of this dance.", "NTA.  You are never somebody else\u2019s emotional support animal.", "Nta  She's lucky to even get an invite with the way she disrespects your mom. So much unearned entitlement.", "NTA. I love how step parents feel they are owed anything by the children of their SO.", "You're NTA. I feel a deep sympathy for your stepmother. She endured a horrible loss and is obviously clinging to what she sees as a way to at least put a patch on a wound she knows will never really close. That said, she's treated your mother terribly, and it sounds like she's pushing you further away as opposed to drawing you closer in. You have every right not to want to dance with her, and had she just accepted it, let it go sooner than she did, I'd say there were no assholes here. I'm still leaning closer to that. But I think ultimately her refusal to accept your feelings pushes her just slightly into asshole territory. She's trying to make her grief ans trauma your responsibility, and she's blaming you for not stepping into a role you never wanted and may not even have realized she wanted. That's not fair to you. Give her time to cool off. Maybe with time she'll understand.", "NTA\n\nA mother and son dance is just that.  For mother and son.  Not woman-who-lost-her-son-and-wants-groom-to-replace-him and son.\n\nAnne's loss is truly tragic, but she can't expect someone who she never built a meaningful relationship with to treat her like a mother.", "NTA. They was never any effort to build a relationship with you, just the expectation that you would automatically accept her with open arms immediately. It's your wedding, and your choice. She has some misdirected anger towards your mom.\n\nI didn't get it from your post, but did your dad cheat with her?", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to force a relationship and notion of family on you, without putting in the work to get there. Personally, I think it\u2019s likely SHE wanted you there while her son died, instead of her son wanting time with you. It sounds like she wants this big, happy nuclear family with no co parents or anything. While what happened to her son is tragic, she can\u2019t use that to force a relationship on you. And as a person with a stepmom, I think forcing you to see her as a mother is toxic generally. You have a mother, she\u2019s present in your life, you do a mother son dance with her.", "NTA! If my dads significant other said such nasty c**p about my mom, I\u2019d uninvite her and cut contact. Does Anne seem like the kind of person who would pitch a fit/make a scene? Because your mother son dances happens ONCE. Think about if you wanna leave it up to chance, that she doesn\u2019t ruin it somehow, and ruin the night in general by make aggressive comments. \n\nOh and Anne is jealous of your mother by the way. That\u2019s why she \u201chates\u201d her.", "NTA.  You're right she's not your stepmother, just someone your father married.   You're not responsible for her feelings or so called broken heart.   I hope your siblings don't allow her to bully them into what she wants.  She's not owed any do over children.", "NTA: I could go on and explain why in a little bit more detail but it should be obvious at this point that cancer sucks and can twist people into be jealous that you have what they were robbed of even if it's not your fault.", "NTA. You are a person, not a consolation prize.", "NTA but I do think it's important to mention a couple things. One, how was she supposed to force your father to introduce her earlier than he did? Why is she being punished for something that is ostensibly his fault? And, where's the anger for your father? Two, a lot of folks are mentioning guilt trips. But I think there's a difference between saying something specifically to manipulate a person into doing something using guilt and a person expressing their feelings or wants that might make someone feel guilty. That line can be fine and blurry sometimes but it does exist. Is your stepmom supposed to not express any feelings or hopes about your wedding or her lack of inclusion in certain traditions? I understand that it's your wedding day and you can make whatever choices you like about how it all proceeds. I'm not saying that you can't or shouldn't. If you don't want to dance with her then I would never suggest you do. But, I'm not sure I agree with everyone that she's trying to manipulate you. Maybe you just don't like that she feels poorly and you're part of the reason. \n\nI think you should seriously consider that she probably feels pretty shitty in a family where everyone has decided that she doesn't belong, a husband who only makes the situation worse, and the one person that she had (her only child!) for closeness and belonging died tragically too young. I can only imagine that I would be going out of my mind with pain and loneliness. My heart actually breaks for her. I don't think many people understand what exclusion in one's own family can do.", "NTA.", "NTA. It's not your job to help her with her grief", "NTA This is your wedding, you and your future wife\u2019s day.  This has nothing to do with her being a parent or having lost a son.

She had to focus on her own son while he was alive, and rightly so. With that illness, it was going to be a lot of emotion pain and time needed to handle, which it sounds like she did as a mother. Once he died though, I think she thought that now she could have a \u2018normal\u2019 mother experience with you guys. And she didn\u2019t. Marriage does not automatically create that relationship. \n\nUnfortunately this has made her bitter in that she has missed out completely on that. And she doesn\u2019t want to accept that her choices, correct as they were with her son, are the reason. Stand by your ground.", "NTA - you are def not the ahole but neither is your StepM except when it comes to blaming your mother. \n\nShe is still obviously grieving the loss of her son and the relationship she desired with you. She is not handling either of these well and is thinking and behaving emotionally rather than logically and rationally. \n\nI wish there was a way to include her just as your father\u2019s wife. For manners I guess and good will. Obviously it\u2019s your call. \n\nGood luck and God bless you and yours. Remember to have fun on your wedding day. It goes by in a blink of an eye.", "ETA - Anne\u2019s the AH. Dad\u2019s the AH. Mom\u2019s the AH and now you\u2019re carrying on the tradition. Look, you\u2019re not responsible for your dad rushing into a marriage, and you\u2019re not responsible for your mom\u2019s insensitivity during the death of Anne\u2019s child. What you are responsible for is what you do now and how you perpetuate these relationships going forward because you aren\u2019t a kid anymore and both of these women will be grandparents to any children you have. \n\nYou have to decide if it\u2019s worth it to hold on to this anger from childhood and if you want to have a tumultuous relationship with Anne for the foreseeable future. It is good to set boundaries around how she speaks about your mother, but what do *you* gain from icing her out for eternity? Family therapy is in order here.", "NTA\u2026this is like the third story where a child of divorce has to deal with a stepparent whose child is dealing with a terminal illness. Wow.", "NTA, but do any of us ever regret doing a kindness for another person?   \n\nIt would be a great kindness and it\u2019ll only take 3 minutes of your life.  \n\nNone of us are perfect.  We all make mistakes.  Anne has experienced the worst tragedy imaginable and her actions left much to be desired.  No question there.  \n\nStill, she\u2019ll be watching something she dreamed about doing with her own son and knows she never will.  \n\nI hope you can be the bigger person here.  Your kindness may teach her far more than your words.\n\n(And before all the Trolls blast me, please remember this is just my opinion.)", "I am a little conflicted. I would say that you and your siblings would be TA because it doesn't seem like you actually ever gave her a chance. Out of all of this, Anna would be NTA, but your dad, who you hardly mentioned, would be TA. He set the stage for the resentment, being the engagement and first meeting. True, Anna is not your mom, but she is floundering and practically begging for a chance to be something more than just your dad's lastest wife. I know people here always talk about minors not being TA, but sadly, minors are usually the biggest AH. In this case, its a no win situation.", "She is broken but a dance is only 5 minutes at the most. She wants to daydream it is her son getting married and she is doing a mother-son dance at a wedding for 5 minutes. I would just do it. (But after you dance with your Mom first)", "What was the deal with your stepbrother wanting you around?  Like, was that known at the time?  Because if y'all couldn't rebook a vacation to keep a child company on his fucking *deathbed* when he asked for you, ESH, in flashing goddamn neon ten feet high.", "I too am sorry for her son. Anne expected everything to just happen magicly without putting in the work and it is mad it didn't. You were suposed to instantly bond with her child and her, to put her child over your mom and when he died be his replacement.", "I agree and would go as far as to say that OP shouldn't invite her to his wedding - she sounds unstable and could possibly make a scene.\n\nNTA OP.", "Agreed", "NTA. She does not sound like a person that should be at your wedding, so seconding the \"don't invite\". Your wedding should be a celebration of your union with your partner, not a consolation prize for Anne because she lost her son. It will undoubtedly cause a lot of drama, but she can't even be civil enough to not trash talk your mom, and is acting like a scorned lover when it comes to your mom. Why do you even want her there?", "She might try to \"cut in\" on the mother-son dance.", "Yeah, that comment is a warning sign. If she can't be civil at the ceremony then she certainly should be part of it at all. Your mom should be comfortable and  this should be happy event; if she can't be happy for you, then she doesn't really care.", "Anne may have some jealousy (resentment) towards OP's mom. Anne lost her only child, OP's mom has three. I'm not saying it's a conscious thing or a deliberate choice. Anne may not even be aware of why she dislikes the ex-wife so much. New spouses have hated exes for much less.", "This.", "\ud83d\udcaf right", "I completely agree with you. I think she and her terminally sick child were excluded and left alone. The father seems completely out of picture. I also suspect that the OP's mother has some contribution in this. I am so sorry for Anne", ">I would just do it.\n\nDoesn't mean that OP has to do it. It looks like he doesn't have any kind of close relationship with her. She isn't entitled to mother-son dance with someone who doesn't even consider her a family.\n\nI wouldn't do it also because she insults OPs mother.\n\nNTA", "It was known that he was dying but not that he was going to go when he did. He took a turn while we were gone and died then.", " She's lucky she's even getting invited.", "She has always stated her dislike stems from mom taking us on the vacation. That she should not have done it, should have let the money go to waste, should have insisted we be there and with her and her son that week. She harbors a lot of anger toward mom for that.", "\u2026 this sub should be renamed the \u201centitled stepparent sub\u201d with the number of delusional stepparents making demands. How did she expect you three to feel about her when she\u2019s clearly jealous of your mother and keeps referring to her as \u201cthat woman\u201d?", "But your mom was doing what moms do, Ann and her son where strangers. Like, if your neighbor was dying, are you going to drop everything? Probably not.", "I think she believes we should see our mom as a monster because she took us on that vacation and didn't listen to her when she said not to. That we should hate our mom because we weren't there when he died.", "For real \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'd say there's only one person that needs therapy here and that's SM\u2026 just saying \"circumstances were such that we never formed a bond and I don't want to be pressured into pretending there is one\" seems like a perfectly normal reaction.", "Christ\u2026 stepmom is aware that she married your *father* and not your mother, right? If anything she should be grateful to your mother for taking you three on vacation because otherwise she and your father would have had to take care of your needs while caring for the sick child. The woman needs objective perspective. \n\n(Also congrats on your upcoming wedding.)", "You're also an adult now so you can avoid her most of the time also. \n\nYou showed ALOT more restraint than I would have when she spoke about your mom that way. I would have freaking lost and likely said more painful truths than you did."]}
