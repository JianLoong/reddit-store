Anne hates my mom. My siblings and I do not regard Anne as our parent because we were 11, 12 and 14 when we met her and when our dad married her. Now, there's some history to be explored before we get into the specific incident.\n\nDad used the time my siblings and I were with mom to build his relationship with Anne and eventually, her son. They were practically engaged before we met her and we met her son at their engagement party. They moved in the very next day and they were married two months later. We were equal time spent with mom and dad. But because of our ages and them being so new to us we did not get super close to Anne or her son in that time. Anne's son ended up diagnosed with a form of cancer that was more likely due to a longer term medical condition he was born with. Anne was away a lot with her son to get him treatment and she was with him out of state in one of the big Children's Hospitals where they specialize in cancers. Mine and my siblings life carried on as normal for the most part. When we were with mom life was totally normal.\n\nAnne's son died while we were on vacation with our mom. We were 17, 15 and 14 at the time. Anne was furious that mom took us. She had wanted us to stay because her son had wanted more time with us but mom had already booked the vacation and we still wanted to go. We were not close to Anne's son and we didn't have a familial bond with him. Anne never got over it and was especially bitter because we were not closer to her after and because most of us chose mom's house over dad's for staying at when we finished high school and wanted to come home. She was resentful that we weren't rallying around her and letting her still feel like a parent.\n\nNow I'm getting married. Anne despises my mom more than ever and when she heard I was doing a mother-son dance at my wedding, she told me she wanted to do one too and deserved to do one if I was doing something with \"that woman\". I told her \"that woman\" is my mom and I wanted to dance with her. I told her we (dad's wife and I) would not be dancing together. She asked how I could say that to her when she lost her only biological child and we didn't give her the chance to continue being a parent. I told her it was not my job. She said it was like she was a stranger, like we weren't family. I told her if she wanted us to be closer she should have made sure dad introduced us all before they were ready to get engaged but we never built up the relationship before they were married and we were all a little older when they did and not there all the time. She told me I was breaking her heart saying no to her and how could I be so thoughtless after what she's lost. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670673743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhqwju/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_shes_not_going_to/", "score": 1487, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very sad that her son died. It is no your job to replace him or to make her feel like a parent. The way she speaks of your mom is incredibly disrespectful and certainly won't make you feel closer to her. You do not owe her a mother-son dance and she is being incredibly entitled to demand it. She is also delusional if she thinks you have a close enough relationship to warrant it.", "NTA\n\nSorry for Anna's loss, but you are not her son's replacement. Moreover, she should not be that bitter about you wanting to spend your time with your actual mother.", "NTA.  Your dad\u2019s wife is using the death of her child to emotionally blackmail you.", " NTA\n\nWhile Anne losing a son is the worst thing that can happen as a parent, you are not responsible for her feelings. Sadly her and your dad's mismanagement of the introduction (you had 2 strangers move into your house) and other situations over which you had no choice or control over meant you never became close.\n\nEven if you had a good relationship with her as a step parent you would still not be required to have a mum - son moment with her.\n\nHer resentment of your mother and her lack of understanding of you and your siblings perspectives make her T A rather than N A H. Even if she hates your mum, she should have enough control over her emotion to be neutral to you about her\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding", "Let\u2019s get this straight, YOUR wedding is not about HER. And it\u2019s certainly not about her because she\u2019s jealous your mom is still a mom", "NTA. You never had a relationship what did she expect", "Step mom here.  NTA.  She should never say a bad word about your mom.  EVER.  And she should respect that the bond you have with your mom will always be different/special. My first thought is it seems to have more with trying to stick it to your mom and for attention than her feelings towards you.  I am sorry she is choosing to pull this shit with your wedding.  She is adding to the shitty step mom reputation unfortunately.", "NTA. I realize not inviting her would really rock the boat, but if she's this mean to your mom, I wouldn't risk a scene at the wedding and/or during your mother-son dance.", "You're NTA. She did nothing to build the relationship but now wants one of the perks. Too bad. She's lucky you even tolerate her considering the way she speaks about your mother.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. Who said anyone needs to dance with their mom AND step-mom if applicable? It doesn't sound like she would deserve one anyway if she has to demand one. If there were a good relationship before, it seems like she could have had a dance with you.", "NTA\n\nShe suffered a horrible loss but that\u2019s separate from the relationship she\u2019s had with you and your siblings. And who TF does she think she is referring to your mother as \u201cthat woman\u201d?? Awful. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA. You don't have the kind of relationship with her that would warrant you wanting to have a mother/son dance at your wedding and she knows it, so she shouldn't expect you to do it. Moreover, she's bringing up her dead son to try and emotionally manipulate you into caving to her demand for a dance. That's pretty bad on its own, but it's so much worse when you add in the jealousy she has of your mother. The \"that woman\" comment would have left me seething.", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, If she wanted a relationship with you, they should have worked harder at building one.\n\nPlus she is acting like a child. Regardless of what SHE thinks of your mum (and I bet she hates her due to feeling jealous and insecure) she should have the sense to know that YOU are close to your mum and she should be respectful about her to avoid hurting your feelings.\n\nBut she doesn't care about your feelings, only her own.\n\nIt is tragic that she lost her child, but you and your siblings are not a replacement, and its telling that she only really started trying after she lost him. She just wants to FEEL like a parent, but she has done nothing to earn that relationship. You cant NAKE people see you like a parent.\n\nYou're allowed to have a dance with whoever you want. Sone people enjoy very close relationships with their step parents, but that did not happen here. Since she's never stepped into a maternal role with you, it makes perfect sense that you dont want to indulge her with a dance and pretend she is on equal footing with your mother.\n\nIt sounds like that's what bothers her, the feeling of \"losing out\" to your mum.", "Skimmed it, but pretty obviously NTA. It's simple, Anne's not your mom. She doesn't *deserve* anything.", "NTA -  for one it is YOUR wedding and no one can tell you how to celebrate it. Second if she is openly that disrespectful to your biological mom you are completely in the right to deny this to her. In my eyes it would be an AH move towards your bio mom if you did do this.", "NTA. Someone else's demands are not your responsibility. She is not your mother but oddly enough your mother is. That's why you're doing a mother/son dance with her. She's lucky she's even getting invited.", "NTA. I do think that this is a really tragic situation because she wasn\u2019t able to develop any sort of relationship with you, because her kid was terminally ill.  It sounds like she wasn\u2019t present for a lot of i your relationship. I feel very badly for her because of what she went through. No parent should ever bury their child and the pain must be unimaginable. \n\nHer comment about your mom is totally wrong but I can also understand how she turned her grief into anger towards your mom for taking you away when he died. It\u2019s wrong to put that on you, and stick you in the middle of it. \n\nit sounds like she needs a massive amount of grief therapy. \n\nI think the real AH is your dad for rushing this marriage after you met. He was the one to choose how you integrated. So many parents believe their protecting their kids by withholding the meeting of the new SO. If this is the reason you\u2019re not close to her as you say, this kinda lies with him because it was his choice to make. He probably thought he was doing the right thing, but obviously he fucked up here. \n\nAnd Anne is also an AH for not being able to recognize that you don\u2019t have the relationship needed to have a \u2018mother\u2019/son dance. You can\u2019t be her surrogate son if the relationship isn\u2019t there.\n\nAll in all, a perfect storm of unfortunate, yet understandable, events that culminated to where you are today.", "Nta.

If there is no real relationship, there's no real reason for the dance. Just Bein married to a child's parent doesn't give you a relationship with that child. Heck, even being a parent doesn't mean a good relationship with your child. The relationship needs to be formed and molded with years of caring, communication, and being there for your child. She lost a child, which is very sad, but that doesn't mean she's owed a replacement, or that you have to take on that role.", "You're NTA for not wanting to dance with your step mother, but I feel like there is a lot of emotional trauma here that needs to be unpacked. It sounds like, as kids, you were put in an impossible 'mom versus the interloper' kind of situation (since your dad didn't really handle introductions all that well or slowly) and it's caused there to be a distance between you and your step mother. Compound that with her own grief and trauma over her son, and the weird 'transference' she seems to be trying to go for and the whole situation is just sad.\n\nYou don't 'owe' her anything and you're right that relationships take work from both parties - so you say she should have 'tried harder' but how hard did you and your siblings try? She was left alone to mourn her own child and that creates so much hurt - you already said she was bitter - but she was probably deeply deeply hurt. I know you were kids and kids don't think about people's feelings. Lack of maturity and all that, but you aren't kids any more. \n\nPerhaps you need to either consider family therapy, and explain to her how her hostility towards your mom is harming your relationship with her?\n\nYou also have an opportunity here to repair some of the damage here but I think there has been a lot of hurt and poorly handled step-family dynamics that you need to all share your feelings in a safe way. It sounds like you resent her and her son for 'invading' your life - you describe time without her as 'normal' implying that time with her is 'abnormal'.\n\nI think you all need counselling tbh. There has been too much that has gone on for this to be a straight up 'yes or no' AITA judgement. I don't think you're the AH for not wanting to do a 'mother son' dance - it's your wedding, but I think the underlying reasons for the request and your refusal are more complex and it wouldn't be right to brand your SM an AH in this scenario.", "Nta", "NTA. She\u2019s not your mother.", "NTA. Her reaction is so bizarre!\n\nEdit: also, what does your dad think about this?", "NTA.  You are not a replacement piece in the puzzle of her life.", "I think she expected that once we weren't hostile when we met her, that we would grow fast love for her and her son and wouldn't need to get to know them before living together and that she'd give him a fuller family. I think she still believes a love could have formed super fast and that I would see her as a parent/mother figure.", "When I said time with mom was normal, I mean it was. When Anne's son was sick things were not the same, because of course they weren't. Anne was either not there with her son and dad was on the phone to her most of the time after work or when they were there, the focus was on making her son comfortable, about needing to not make so much noise and stuff. We didn't have anything change at mom's during that time.", "I also have great sympathy for your step bro - he was probably very unhappy - between his own familial upheaval and suddenly having to live with 3 other siblings who were, at best, indifferent, and doing this while terminally ill as well, it sounds like he went through a rough time too. And that wasn't his fault any more than it was yours.", "Exactly - and that upheaval will have left lasting trauma on you and your siblings. This whole situation is very sad and was poorly handled from the start. I don't think it's fair to demonise your SM but her hostility towards your mom isn't helping her cause. I think you all need some family therapy because a lot of the damage runs deep here.", "It wasn't. I feel bad for the kid because he was 4 when we met him, but he knew our dad pretty much all his life, but never lived with him. Then suddenly he did and three older kids were there part time who didn't love his mom, didn't love him, didn't instantly regard him as family and were awkward with the set up before he got sick and then he was sick and was back and forth from a hospital in a different state. It was a lot for him.", "I don't think family therapy will do much because there's no love or family feeling on the part of my siblings and I. To me she's nothing more than my dad's wife and I don't have very strong feelings for her to try and make us more than we are at this point in time.", "Nta but it isn't about choosing sides man. Your dad messed up by rushing everything. How is she to you guys? Forget your mom, just you and your siblings.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is still with us, you're close to your mom, you dance with her, case closed.\n\nStepmom is a bitter AH trying to muscle in on your dance and make it about her.\n\nStepson-stepmom dances aren't really a thing at weddings...unless it's a unique case where the groom wants one.  I had a stepmom at my wedding, perfectly nice person, but no expectation of this dance.", "NTA.

I love how step parents feel they are owed anything by the children of their SO.", "You're NTA. I feel a deep sympathy for your stepmother. She endured a horrible loss and is obviously clinging to what she sees as a way to at least put a patch on a wound she knows will never really close. That said, she's treated your mother terribly, and it sounds like she's pushing you further away as opposed to drawing you closer in. You have every right not to want to dance with her, and had she just accepted it, let it go sooner than she did, I'd say there were no assholes here. I'm still leaning closer to that. But I think ultimately her refusal to accept your feelings pushes her just slightly into asshole territory. She's trying to make her grief ans trauma your responsibility, and she's blaming you for not stepping into a role you never wanted and may not even have realized she wanted. That's not fair to you. Give her time to cool off. Maybe with time she'll understand.", "NTA\n\nA mother and son dance is just that.  For mother and son.  Not woman-who-lost-her-son-and-wants-groom-to-replace-him and son.\n\nAnne's loss is truly tragic, but she can't expect someone who she never built a meaningful relationship with to treat her like a mother.", "NTA. They was never any effort to build a relationship with you, just the expectation that you would automatically accept her with open arms immediately. It's your wedding, and your choice. She has some misdirected anger towards your mom.\n\nI didn't get it from your post, but did your dad cheat with her?", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to force a relationship and notion of family on you, without putting in the work to get there. Personally, I think it\u2019s likely SHE wanted you there while her son died, instead of her son wanting time with you. It sounds like she wants this big, happy nuclear family with no co parents or anything. While what happened to her son is tragic, she can\u2019t use that to force a relationship on you. And as a person with a stepmom, I think forcing you to see her as a mother is toxic generally. You have a mother, she\u2019s present in your life, you do a mother son dance with her.", "NTA! If my dads significant other said such nasty c**p about my mom, I\u2019d uninvite her and cut contact. Does Anne seem like the kind of person who would pitch a fit/make a scene? Because your mother son dances happens ONCE. Think about if you wanna leave it up to chance, that she doesn\u2019t ruin it somehow, and ruin the night in general by make aggressive comments. \n\nOh and Anne is jealous of your mother by the way. That\u2019s why she \u201chates\u201d her.", "NTA.  You're right she's not your stepmother, just someone your father married.   You're not responsible for her feelings or so called broken heart.   I hope your siblings don't allow her to bully them into what she wants.  She's not owed any do over children.", "NTA: I could go on and explain why in a little bit more detail but it should be obvious at this point that cancer sucks and can twist people into be jealous that you have what they were robbed of even if it's not your fault.", "NTA. You are a person, not a consolation prize.", "NTA but I do think it's important to mention a couple things. One, how was she supposed to force your father to introduce her earlier than he did? Why is she being punished for something that is ostensibly his fault? And, where's the anger for your father? Two, a lot of folks are mentioning guilt trips. But I think there's a difference between saying something specifically to manipulate a person into doing something using guilt and a person expressing their feelings or wants that might make someone feel guilty. That line can be fine and blurry sometimes but it does exist. Is your stepmom supposed to not express any feelings or hopes about your wedding or her lack of inclusion in certain traditions? I understand that it's your wedding day and you can make whatever choices you like about how it all proceeds. I'm not saying that you can't or shouldn't. If you don't want to dance with her then I would never suggest you do. But, I'm not sure I agree with everyone that she's trying to manipulate you. Maybe you just don't like that she feels poorly and you're part of the reason. \n\nI think you should seriously consider that she probably feels pretty shitty in a family where everyone has decided that she doesn't belong, a husband who only makes the situation worse, and the one person that she had (her only child!) for closeness and belonging died tragically too young. I can only imagine that I would be going out of my mind with pain and loneliness. My heart actually breaks for her. I don't think many people understand what exclusion in one's own family can do.", "NTA.", "NTA. It's not your job to help her with her grief", "NTA This is your wedding, you and your future wife\u2019s day.  This has nothing to do with her being a parent or having lost a son.

Yet she won't put in the effort or do anything about it because she feels entitled to simply getting it.\n\nLosing a child is utterly tragic, but you don't pick up a replacement just because you wany to do things.", "NTA. While it\u2019s heartbreaking what happened to her son, as above you\u2019re no replacement. And poisoning you on your own mother doesn\u2019t really help her case. I think she needs professional help. \n\nI\u2019d worry about your wedding security in case she tries to pull off something or make a scene. I\u2019d go low contact after if she doesn\u2019t get any help.", "All of this. NTA, it\u2019s super warped anyway to have expectations of someone else\u2019s kids to take the place of someone they lost just so they could feel like a Mom. I feel for her, but it seems like she needs therapy and not a dance.", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. But you could ask her to dance for another selection or not have any slow dances at all except for the mother/son and father/daughter ones.", "Agreed. She's going to get more and more wound up as the ceremony goes on, and eventually kick off. I'd bet money on it based on her comments.", "If my kids step mom EVER referred to me as that I'd be having some words with that woman. I'm glad OP is sticking to their guns and not caving to the manipulation", "I think waiting is correct.   However it means you go twice as slow.   Meaning that once they meet,  you give it time before moving in.", "Agreed. Grief is a terrible unpredictable poison.  I'm not sure there's a perfect way to handle this.  I would say though that the best thing to do would be to find a solution that has the best chance of preventing any drama at the wedding itself without compromising you wants.  Taking too hard-handed of an approach could backfire and end up causing a scene at the wedding.  Wouldn't want you to lose that moment in time because you can never get it back.", "I think it can happen. It just takes time when you're older and the best way to connect is to let it happen slowly over time. Not to expect insta bonding within 4 months of meeting someone to the point of now being family.", "It\u2019s a very stupid opinion. Why should he dance with someone he doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with? She wants a dance because his mom is getting one. Guess what. Stupid step parents aren\u2019t parents.  And if someone sat and talked shit about my mom she wouldn\u2019t even be invited. Period.", "Sometimes doing a kindness absolutely becomes a regret if the person the kindness is done for has the personality and history to indicate they will use it in the future as precedence to get what they want all the time. It would be nice if kindness could be it's own reward but sometimes it can become it's own punishment instead.", "Stories similar to this keep getting posted with slight different details changed over the past week or so. It\u2019s like people are trying to see who get the story just right lol.", "Anna\u2019s hostility towards OP\u2019s mother and lack of boundaries definitely makes her an asshole. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say OP and his siblings didn\u2019t give her a chance since she\u2019s not entitled to being seen as a new parent\u2014the kids were grown when they met her. They could have had a warmer, friendlier relationship had Anna not insisted on being a second mother to kids that already have a mother.", "Now take that idea to the next thing. Pretty soon every event needs to be about letting her be nasty until she gets her own way because \"she's just daydreaming it's her son\" doing it. Which is not helpful to her either. It would be so easy to personalize things for her like that, and as someone who has been where she is in grieving the loss of a child, it's only going to be more painful to be in that mindset.", "I don't love her, I don't consider her my family. That's why I want to dance with just my mom. I love my mom.", "Anne didn't know exactly when. She knew he would die and she knew it was coming sooner rather than later, but he went sooner than they expected. Our mom was able to give us something fun and she did what we wanted. We wanted to go. We wanted to get away and have the vacation. She spoke to us and knew we wanted to go.", "Not on our end we're not. I don't feel any kind of close to her.", "It doesn't matter if it's a single dance, it's OP'S wedding. Something that should be one of the happiest moments of his life. It's not his obligation to do something that upsets him at his own wedding, which will hopefully be a once in a lifetime event.", "My wife once stated a truth that many people not in that position don't see.  There is a difference between being a stepmother and being dad's wife.  OP and his siblings were older when they met dad's wife, and they were kept apart by the wife's unfortunate circumstances, pouring all her attention and effort into trying to keep her son alive.  It was understandable for her to do that, and right or wrong, it affected dad's children.  \n\nWhile OP would be NTA not giving Anne a mother-son dance, it might be healing if he would dance with her when the other guests are dancing.", "Sounds like she wanted a hallmark movie ending and didn\u2019t get it. Sucks for her.", "Agreed with this take. Op and his siblings aren\u2019t being treated as human beings on their own terms. Anne just wants children around so she can feel like a mom.\n\nNTA, op. Your father and his wife handled this poorly. It\u2019s not on you to fix it.", "Since most don't hire security, maybe OP can corral his groomsmen to keep an eye on her.\n\nAnd if one of said groomsmen is willing, maybe \"he\" could dance with her during the mother/son dance and Stepmom can close her eyes and pretend it's her own son she's dancing with.  Less fraught with emotion that way.\n\nThis would be way to keep her busy/distracted and supervised during OP's Mother/Son dance.\n\nETA: OP=NTA.  These things are your decision and you shouldn't be guilted by anyone(including redditors) to have a special dance with someone who you don't feel those feelings for out of pity.", "That's when you keep dancing, and if dad doesn't immediately get her ass off the dance floor, they both go straight into the \"no info\" list for future life events, such as, oh, you know, pregnancy announcements & showers & due dates & births of future grandkids.", "This sounds so out there... OP claims never to had a relationship with SM. I am sure it would be reciprocal. So now SM asking for a dance seems farfetched. Like that is not how anyone I know operates.", "Then that makes you all a bit of TA too. Death doesn\u2019t have RSVP cards, no one knows the exact day. She knew enough to ask you to hang back. As your parent your mom should have modelled compassion, instead she felt that children wanting to go on vacation meant more than being present for their dying step sibling. I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted into oblivion, because Reddit hates stepmoms, but your mom acted selfishly and allowed you and your siblings to act selfishly. And now you have the chance to do a small kindness for a woman who has lost everything, and you are choosing to be selfish again.", "OP owes her nothing and she's trifling for being disrespectful to his mom and expecting him to give her something like a mother son dance. She demanded it. She should be the one trying to heal and also that's not something you do at a wedding for brownie points. That's something you put time and effort into when you're not PR-ing as the stepmom in front of a crowd. NTA", "Personally I would rather not invite her. I have a distinct feeling that she's the type who would cause a scene by trying to force a situation, in this case the mother son dance. \n\nNTA OP but honestly I would continue to set and abide by strict boundaries with this woman.", "I\u2019d uninvite her if she called my mom \u201cthat woman\u201d.", "Tell her outright that you agree with your mom and that you have no regrets.   You were children,  you didn't need to get dragged into a traumatic death bed scene with a kid you didn't know well.", "In a similar boat relationship-wise with my dad\u2019s wife. (Not my mother.) I made it clear that the more she disrespected my mother, the less likely we were to build any sort of relationship. This is basic relationship math 101. \n\nThis is worth a discussion with your father and a battle for him to fight. I went NC with my dad\u2019s wife (I can\u2019t even call her step-mother) when she wouldn\u2019t stop. My siblings quickly followed suit. Also went LC with my father when he wouldn\u2019t deal with his wife\u2019s shenanigans. Neither of them could/wanted to understand what they trialed losing. \n\nNTA", "Doesn't Anne know how expensive vacations are?!! I'm sorry, but how does she expect you to cancel a vacation for someone you barely know? \n\n\nI feel sort of bad for her son, however, I think that if you had any sort of friendship, you would've stayed. As you said, basically strangers.", "Info: did ya'll  have any possible  indication he'd  die that week?", "It doesn't. But honestly, I have never regretted not being there when he died. I'm honestly glad I wasn't. I wasn't close to him. His death was tragic and sad and it shouldn't have happened, but it did not have any big impact on me.", "I disagree with this.  As presented.  The Stepsibling of 3 yrs(at the time) was not regarded as a sibling and had not been present much during the paternal custodial time.\n\nWas it appropriate to demand the 3 kids sit on some sort of death watch?Would it have been required of them for a dying schoolmate? a cousin?\n\nPlus, the rather unstable quality of the stepmother(blaming bio-mom, demanding place as \"mom\" in wedding).  She could have attacked the kids emotionally/verbally for still being alive when her kid was dying/after he died.\n\nIt seems to me that having the kids see him before their vacation makes sense(not sure if that was done or offered) but having the kids go on with their life when the child was not actually expected to die, wasn't unreasonable for the bio-mom.  Her job was HER children's well-being.\n\nPicture, if the reverse happened.  Children don't go on vacation, stepsibling continues to live but is suffering.   Imagine the mental toll on OP and siblings.\n\n<< knew enough to ask you to hang back>> No, I don't think stepmom knew enough, I think she wanted everything to revolve around herself and her son(just as she expects OP to make everything revolve around her).", "It wasn\u2019t a sibling, it was someone that OP didn\u2019t feel connected to that happened to be the child of the woman his dad married.  Marriage does not create instant bonds between people that barely know each other.", "So you expect everyone to put their lives on hold for an unknown period of time? That's completely unreasonable as it could've been months. Taking a sudden turn for the worse is just that sudden. You are correct no one knows the exact say so no one should be expected to sit and wait until that day comes. It's just unreasonable and unrealistic.", "That's an absurd take on her end. You guys were kids who weren't even close to her son. It was better for you guys to NOT have to be around and watch him pass when there was no emotional connection. It's understandable that she had the idea in her head of you guys all being a big, happy, blended family. However that wasn't the reality and she wants to keep deluding herself into thinking it is, and is angry that you guys are not also playing along with her delusion. It is tragic that she lost her child, and it is sad that the entire blended family did not get as close as she hoped. However, you are not a replacement for her child and she does not get to play the role of mother when you not only do not have the connection with her, but she also bad mouths your actual mother for having the connection she wants. NTA", "She knows that already. She still blames our mom.", "Jesus Christ. Am I the only person here who thinks if someone wants to see you on their deathbed, that it should take priority over a fucking vacation? It\u2019s not about you at that point, but providing comfort to another human being who is going through unimaginable pain. I don\u2019t think the kids are to blame at all, but I completely understand why Anne hates OP\u2019s mom, and I\u2019m saddened that OP can\u2019t at the very least cut her some slack for that. Granted, I don\u2019t think he owes her the mother/son dance or anything, but otherwise should cool it with everything else.", "He probably had been told stories about you his whole life, about the cool older siblings he would get when your dad married his mom. Poor kid.\n\nWhat is wrong with your dad that he didn\u2019t introduce you earlier?", "Ummm just because you weren\u2019t close with someone doesn\u2019t mean that you should be \u201cglad\u201d that you weren\u2019t there for them when they were dying from cancer at the age of 7\u2026..and he had been your step brother for 3 years at this point\u2026.YTA", "So there it is. Your wants around his death were more important than his wants around his death. I\u2019ll give you a pass because you were a kid, but now as an adult, if upon reflection if you can\u2019t see how self-absorbed that is then you have a real problem.", "I want to see you when I'm on my deathbed.  Please dm me your deets so I can let you know when the time comes.  Obviously you will pay all expenses to get to me when it happens as I should have priority over anything else that's going on in your life.", "So if an aquaintance  wants  to see you on their death bed (leaving aside  they were  children  and their mom  probably  tried  to protect  them from seeing  the death bed scene)  your supposed  to  let the vacation  be wasted to go?\nIf you want to do them the favor  sure otherwise  there is no obligation  imo.", "The issue with that is he took a turn for the worse sooner than expected while they were gone. It's unreasonable to expect people to put their lives on hold for what could be months especially for someone they don't really have a relationship with.", "You bring up a good point. I\u2019m playing devil\u2019s advocate here, but family dynamics are sometimes messy. Is it possible Annie\u2019s son didn\u2019t ask for OP and his siblings to be at his deathbed? Was Annie looking for a chance to have OP and siblings \u201cpick\u201d her over their mom? It sounds like Annie had a very \u201cyour mom or me\u201d attitude which isn\u2019t healthy (not just about the vacation conflict). It sounds as if she wanted to be seen and loved on equal footing with OPs mom and that can\u2019t be forced. \nWould it have been the kind thing to do to be there for Annie and her son? Yes. Probably awkward as hell. I know how complicated relationships with blended families can be, so can\u2019t be too critical about OPs choice to go on vacation.", "I agree with you on this. While I don't really think OP is TA here, a lot of the people commenting come across as cruel", "This argument seems to stem from the idea that OP should care about his step brother. However, with the lack of an intimate connection, it seems like staying behind and wasting a significant amount of money is not worth it. \n \nIt seems like he feels the scenario is like putting his priorities aside to cater to the needs of a neighbour: sure, it would be nice to do so, but there is no need to, especially if money is on the line.\n\nOP is NTA. Sure, I can understand the stepmom's anger, but the OP is NOT obligated to do whatever she says just because she lost her son, especially since OP is not close with her. OP should not take the risk of drama at the event: uninvite her from the wedding and get some form of security just in case. Optimally, weddings are a once in a lifetime event, and if the stepmom destroys the event, OP will forever regret.", "Not an obligation \u2014 but an opportunity to do something meaningful and help someone in a time when there is probably very little else that can comfort them. I literally cannot imagine how painful it must be to face your mortality like that, and for whatever reason, Anne\u2019s son wanted to get to know them before he passed. Instead, he spends it alone, thinking about them on vacation. Again, I don\u2019t think OP is an asshole for going on vacation, but I wish he had a little more compassion to understand why a mother might be resentful about her son going through that."]}
