Anne hates my mom. My siblings and I do not regard Anne as our parent because we were 11, 12 and 14 when we met her and when our dad married her. Now, there's some history to be explored before we get into the specific incident.\n\nDad used the time my siblings and I were with mom to build his relationship with Anne and eventually, her son. They were practically engaged before we met her and we met her son at their engagement party. They moved in the very next day and they were married two months later. We were equal time spent with mom and dad. But because of our ages and them being so new to us we did not get super close to Anne or her son in that time. Anne's son ended up diagnosed with a form of cancer that was more likely due to a longer term medical condition he was born with. Anne was away a lot with her son to get him treatment and she was with him out of state in one of the big Children's Hospitals where they specialize in cancers. Mine and my siblings life carried on as normal for the most part. When we were with mom life was totally normal.\n\nAnne's son died while we were on vacation with our mom. We were 17, 15 and 14 at the time. Anne was furious that mom took us. She had wanted us to stay because her son had wanted more time with us but mom had already booked the vacation and we still wanted to go. We were not close to Anne's son and we didn't have a familial bond with him. Anne never got over it and was especially bitter because we were not closer to her after and because most of us chose mom's house over dad's for staying at when we finished high school and wanted to come home. She was resentful that we weren't rallying around her and letting her still feel like a parent.\n\nNow I'm getting married. Anne despises my mom more than ever and when she heard I was doing a mother-son dance at my wedding, she told me she wanted to do one too and deserved to do one if I was doing something with \"that woman\". I told her \"that woman\" is my mom and I wanted to dance with her. I told her we (dad's wife and I) would not be dancing together. She asked how I could say that to her when she lost her only biological child and we didn't give her the chance to continue being a parent. I told her it was not my job. She said it was like she was a stranger, like we weren't family. I told her if she wanted us to be closer she should have made sure dad introduced us all before they were ready to get engaged but we never built up the relationship before they were married and we were all a little older when they did and not there all the time. She told me I was breaking her heart saying no to her and how could I be so thoughtless after what she's lost. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670673743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhqwju/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_shes_not_going_to/", "score": 2336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very sad that her son died. It is no your job to replace him or to make her feel like a parent. The way she speaks of your mom is incredibly disrespectful and certainly won't make you feel closer to her. You do not owe her a mother-son dance and she is being incredibly entitled to demand it. She is also delusional if she thinks you have a close enough relationship to warrant it.", "NTA\n\nSorry for Anna's loss, but you are not her son's replacement. Moreover, she should not be that bitter about you wanting to spend your time with your actual mother.", "NTA.  Your dad\u2019s wife is using the death of her child to emotionally blackmail you.", " NTA\n\nWhile Anne losing a son is the worst thing that can happen as a parent, you are not responsible for her feelings. Sadly her and your dad's mismanagement of the introduction (you had 2 strangers move into your house) and other situations over which you had no choice or control over meant you never became close.\n\nEven if you had a good relationship with her as a step parent you would still not be required to have a mum - son moment with her.\n\nHer resentment of your mother and her lack of understanding of you and your siblings perspectives make her T A rather than N A H. Even if she hates your mum, she should have enough control over her emotion to be neutral to you about her\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding", "Let\u2019s get this straight, YOUR wedding is not about HER. And it\u2019s certainly not about her because she\u2019s jealous your mom is still a mom", "NTA. You never had a relationship what did she expect", "Step mom here.  NTA.  She should never say a bad word about your mom.  EVER.  And she should respect that the bond you have with your mom will always be different/special. My first thought is it seems to have more with trying to stick it to your mom and for attention than her feelings towards you.  I am sorry she is choosing to pull this shit with your wedding.  She is adding to the shitty step mom reputation unfortunately.", "NTA. I realize not inviting her would really rock the boat, but if she's this mean to your mom, I wouldn't risk a scene at the wedding and/or during your mother-son dance.", "You're NTA. She did nothing to build the relationship but now wants one of the perks. Too bad. She's lucky you even tolerate her considering the way she speaks about your mother.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. Who said anyone needs to dance with their mom AND step-mom if applicable? It doesn't sound like she would deserve one anyway if she has to demand one. If there were a good relationship before, it seems like she could have had a dance with you.", "NTA\n\nShe suffered a horrible loss but that\u2019s separate from the relationship she\u2019s had with you and your siblings. And who TF does she think she is referring to your mother as \u201cthat woman\u201d?? Awful. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA. You don't have the kind of relationship with her that would warrant you wanting to have a mother/son dance at your wedding and she knows it, so she shouldn't expect you to do it. Moreover, she's bringing up her dead son to try and emotionally manipulate you into caving to her demand for a dance. That's pretty bad on its own, but it's so much worse when you add in the jealousy she has of your mother. The \"that woman\" comment would have left me seething.", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, If she wanted a relationship with you, they should have worked harder at building one.\n\nPlus she is acting like a child. Regardless of what SHE thinks of your mum (and I bet she hates her due to feeling jealous and insecure) she should have the sense to know that YOU are close to your mum and she should be respectful about her to avoid hurting your feelings.\n\nBut she doesn't care about your feelings, only her own.\n\nIt is tragic that she lost her child, but you and your siblings are not a replacement, and its telling that she only really started trying after she lost him. She just wants to FEEL like a parent, but she has done nothing to earn that relationship. You cant NAKE people see you like a parent.\n\nYou're allowed to have a dance with whoever you want. Sone people enjoy very close relationships with their step parents, but that did not happen here. Since she's never stepped into a maternal role with you, it makes perfect sense that you dont want to indulge her with a dance and pretend she is on equal footing with your mother.\n\nIt sounds like that's what bothers her, the feeling of \"losing out\" to your mum.", "Skimmed it, but pretty obviously NTA. It's simple, Anne's not your mom. She doesn't *deserve* anything.", "NTA -  for one it is YOUR wedding and no one can tell you how to celebrate it. Second if she is openly that disrespectful to your biological mom you are completely in the right to deny this to her. In my eyes it would be an AH move towards your bio mom if you did do this.", "NTA. Someone else's demands are not your responsibility. She is not your mother but oddly enough your mother is. That's why you're doing a mother/son dance with her. She's lucky she's even getting invited.", "NTA. I do think that this is a really tragic situation because she wasn\u2019t able to develop any sort of relationship with you, because her kid was terminally ill.  It sounds like she wasn\u2019t present for a lot of i your relationship. I feel very badly for her because of what she went through. No parent should ever bury their child and the pain must be unimaginable. \n\nHer comment about your mom is totally wrong but I can also understand how she turned her grief into anger towards your mom for taking you away when he died. It\u2019s wrong to put that on you, and stick you in the middle of it. \n\nit sounds like she needs a massive amount of grief therapy. \n\nI think the real AH is your dad for rushing this marriage after you met. He was the one to choose how you integrated. So many parents believe their protecting their kids by withholding the meeting of the new SO. If this is the reason you\u2019re not close to her as you say, this kinda lies with him because it was his choice to make. He probably thought he was doing the right thing, but obviously he fucked up here. \n\nAnd Anne is also an AH for not being able to recognize that you don\u2019t have the relationship needed to have a \u2018mother\u2019/son dance. You can\u2019t be her surrogate son if the relationship isn\u2019t there.\n\nAll in all, a perfect storm of unfortunate, yet understandable, events that culminated to where you are today.", "Nta.

If there is no real relationship, there's no real reason for the dance. Just Bein married to a child's parent doesn't give you a relationship with that child. Heck, even being a parent doesn't mean a good relationship with your child. The relationship needs to be formed and molded with years of caring, communication, and being there for your child.

Anne was either not there with her son and dad was on the phone to her most of the time after work or when they were there, the focus was on making her son comfortable, about needing to not make so much noise and stuff.

She endured a horrible loss and is obviously clinging to what she sees as a way to at least put a patch on a wound she knows will never really close. That said, she's treated your mother terribly, and it sounds like she's pushing you further away as opposed to drawing you closer in. You have every right not to want to dance with her, and had she just accepted it, let it go sooner than she did, I'd say there were no assholes here. I'm still leaning closer to that. But I think ultimately her refusal to accept your feelings pushes her just slightly into asshole territory. She's trying to make her grief ans trauma your responsibility, and she's blaming you for not stepping into a role you never wanted and may not even have realized she wanted. That's not fair to you. Give her time to cool off. Maybe with time she'll understand.", "NTA\n\nA mother and son dance is just that.  For mother and son.

She\u2019s trying to force a relationship and notion of family on you, without putting in the work to get there. Personally, I think it\u2019s likely SHE wanted you there while her son died, instead of her son wanting time with you. It sounds like she wants this big, happy nuclear family with no co parents or anything. While what happened to her son is tragic, she can\u2019t use that to force a relationship on you. And as a person with a stepmom, I think forcing you to see her as a mother is toxic generally. You have a mother, she\u2019s present in your life, you do a mother son dance with her.", "NTA!

I hope your siblings don't allow her to bully them into what she wants.  She's not owed any do over children.", "NTA: I could go on and explain why in a little bit more detail but it should be obvious at this point that cancer sucks and can twist people into be jealous that you have what they were robbed of even if it's not your fault.", "NTA. You are a person, not a consolation prize.", "NTA but I do think it's important to mention a couple things. One, how was she supposed to force your father to introduce her earlier than he did? Why is she being punished for something that is ostensibly his fault? And, where's the anger for your father? Two, a lot of folks are mentioning guilt trips. But I think there's a difference between saying something specifically to manipulate a person into doing something using guilt and a person expressing their feelings or wants that might make someone feel guilty. That line can be fine and blurry sometimes but it does exist. Is your stepmom supposed to not express any feelings or hopes about your wedding or her lack of inclusion in certain traditions? I understand that it's your wedding day and you can make whatever choices you like about how it all proceeds. I'm not saying that you can't or shouldn't. If you don't want to dance with her then I would never suggest you do. But, I'm not sure I agree with everyone that she's trying to manipulate you. Maybe you just don't like that she feels poorly and you're part of the reason. \n\nI think you should seriously consider that she probably feels pretty shitty in a family where everyone has decided that she doesn't belong, a husband who only makes the situation worse, and the one person that she had (her only child!) for closeness and belonging died tragically too young. I can only imagine that I would be going out of my mind with pain and loneliness. My heart actually breaks for her.

Yet she knew we had not met her or really known about her. That is why I feel the way I do.

You\u2019re not her replacement kid, that\u2019s really unhealthy of her. \n\nBigger picture, it sounds like you may be in a loyalty bind. Not your fault, but try to recognize it. Stepmom hates mom, it probably goes the other way too, but you can still be open to a relationship with your stepmom. That\u2019s not a betrayal of your mom. I have a stepmom that came along when I was about 12. She\u2019s like a mom to me. I call her mom. I love my mom too.

The only way out is through and she needs to be walked through that because it's going to be really painful.\n\nNone of that means you have to or should concede to her demand with the mother-son dance or that you will be her son replacement. But you might suggest that you'd be willing to go to counseling and explore establishing a warmer relationship with her.\n\nFrom a personal perspective here, I have 3 grown sons and, if one of them had died in childhood, only the fact that I still had two sons who needed me would have kept me from going insane with grief.", "> OP owes her nothing and she's trifling for being disrespectful to his mom and expecting him to give her something like a mother son dance.\n\nExactly!\n\nDo not encourage that type of dynamic or else it will create ever escalating entitlement and conflict.

We know that even with an actively dying child in the household, OPs time there went on mostly normally. OPs dad stayed behind to be with OP and his siblings during his custody time, and stepmom travelled alone with her dying toddler for medical treatment. \n\nIt sounds like the vacation was the first time she said we need to make a change. That means she likely did know it was time. If anything it sounds like OP and his siblings were too sheltered from the situation and death from how detached he feels about it.", "Children should absolutely not have to be around to experience that if it is someone they don't have a connection with. That is flat out cruel to cause the children emotional trauma like that over someone they themselves have no relationship to.

SM disliking her for that just continues to prove her selfishness and immaturity.", "But DID the kid want them there or did the MOM want them there?", "Anne\u2019s anger is misdirected though. She is likely angry that OP\u2019s mom still has her children alive and with her while she has had to bury her son after a cancer battle.

Her only son died tragically and likely only remembered a life full of pain. That doesn\u2019t mean that she is justified in how she is acting. My mama heart hurts for her but also recognizes that she is focusing on the trip instead of coping with her reality and the unfairness of it all.", "Then as sad as it was, extra unreasonable  for Anne to have expected  your mom not to do things with her children. That's not realistic,  we're you all supposed to keep your life on hold, waiting for the moment he'd  die? That's  a grim burden to put on you all as children.", "I'm not even sure. His expectations always appeared different to hers which could be part of it. She expected we'd be a family and love each other by the time they were married. I never got the feeling dad expected that.

Furthermore, I don\u2019t see any evidence in this post that Anne didn\u2019t love her son, and while she does display some manipulative behavior, I don\u2019t think it amounts to what would be required to use his cancer for her own benefit.", "I get the point you\u2019re trying to make \u2014 but even ignoring the glaring differences, I\u2019d honestly go if I had any reason to believe you were sincere. It\u2019s not for me to judge what will make things more bearable at such time, and at the end of the day I\u2019d feel better about myself knowing that I did what I could than I\u2019d have in fleeting memories of a vacation (that in all likelihood I could have taken at another time)", "I don\u2019t remember reading that (that it was sooner than expected), but that\u2019s not an irrelevant point.
