Anne hates my mom. My siblings and I do not regard Anne as our parent because we were 11, 12 and 14 when we met her and when our dad married her. Now, there's some history to be explored before we get into the specific incident.\n\nDad used the time my siblings and I were with mom to build his relationship with Anne and eventually, her son. They were practically engaged before we met her and we met her son at their engagement party. They moved in the very next day and they were married two months later. We were equal time spent with mom and dad. But because of our ages and them being so new to us we did not get super close to Anne or her son in that time. Anne's son ended up diagnosed with a form of cancer that was more likely due to a longer term medical condition he was born with. Anne was away a lot with her son to get him treatment and she was with him out of state in one of the big Children's Hospitals where they specialize in cancers. Mine and my siblings life carried on as normal for the most part. When we were with mom life was totally normal.\n\nAnne's son died while we were on vacation with our mom. We were 17, 15 and 14 at the time. Anne was furious that mom took us. She had wanted us to stay because her son had wanted more time with us but mom had already booked the vacation and we still wanted to go. We were not close to Anne's son and we didn't have a familial bond with him. Anne never got over it and was especially bitter because we were not closer to her after and because most of us chose mom's house over dad's for staying at when we finished high school and wanted to come home. She was resentful that we weren't rallying around her and letting her still feel like a parent.\n\nNow I'm getting married. Anne despises my mom more than ever and when she heard I was doing a mother-son dance at my wedding, she told me she wanted to do one too and deserved to do one if I was doing something with \"that woman\". I told her \"that woman\" is my mom and I wanted to dance with her. I told her we (dad's wife and I) would not be dancing together. She asked how I could say that to her when she lost her only biological child and we didn't give her the chance to continue being a parent. I told her it was not my job. She said it was like she was a stranger, like we weren't family. I told her if she wanted us to be closer she should have made sure dad introduced us all before they were ready to get engaged but we never built up the relationship before they were married and we were all a little older when they did and not there all the time. She told me I was breaking her heart saying no to her and how could I be so thoughtless after what she's lost. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670673743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhqwju/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_shes_not_going_to/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very sad that her son died. It is no your job to replace him or to make her feel like a parent. The way she speaks of your mom is incredibly disrespectful and certainly won't make you feel closer to her. You do not owe her a mother-son dance and she is being incredibly entitled to demand it. She is also delusional if she thinks you have a close enough relationship to warrant it.", "NTA\n\nSorry for Anna's loss, but you are not her son's replacement. Moreover, she should not be that bitter about you wanting to spend your time with your actual mother.", "NTA.  Your dad\u2019s wife is using the death of her child to emotionally blackmail you.", " NTA\n\nWhile Anne losing a son is the worst thing that can happen as a parent, you are not responsible for her feelings. Sadly her and your dad's mismanagement of the introduction (you had 2 strangers move into your house) and other situations over which you had no choice or control over meant you never became close.\n\nEven if you had a good relationship with her as a step parent you would still not be required to have a mum - son moment with her.\n\nHer resentment of your mother and her lack of understanding of you and your siblings perspectives make her T A rather than N A H. Even if she hates your mum, she should have enough control over her emotion to be neutral to you about her\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding", "Let\u2019s get this straight, YOUR wedding is not about HER. And it\u2019s certainly not about her because she\u2019s jealous your mom is still a mom", "NTA. You never had a relationship what did she expect", "Step mom here.  NTA.  She should never say a bad word about your mom.  EVER.  And she should respect that the bond you have with your mom will always be different/special. My first thought is it seems to have more with trying to stick it to your mom and for attention than her feelings towards you.  I am sorry she is choosing to pull this shit with your wedding.  She is adding to the shitty step mom reputation unfortunately.", "NTA. I realize not inviting her would really rock the boat, but if she's this mean to your mom, I wouldn't risk a scene at the wedding and/or during your mother-son dance.", "You're NTA. She did nothing to build the relationship but now wants one of the perks. Too bad. She's lucky you even tolerate her considering the way she speaks about your mother.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. Who said anyone needs to dance with their mom AND step-mom if applicable? It doesn't sound like she would deserve one anyway if she has to demand one. If there were a good relationship before, it seems like she could have had a dance with you.", "NTA\n\nShe suffered a horrible loss but that\u2019s separate from the relationship she\u2019s had with you and your siblings. And who TF does she think she is referring to your mother as \u201cthat woman\u201d?? Awful. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA. You don't have the kind of relationship with her that would warrant you wanting to have a mother/son dance at your wedding and she knows it, so she shouldn't expect you to do it. Moreover, she's bringing up her dead son to try and emotionally manipulate you into caving to her demand for a dance. That's pretty bad on its own, but it's so much worse when you add in the jealousy she has of your mother. The \"that woman\" comment would have left me seething.", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, If she wanted a relationship with you, they should have worked harder at building one.\n\nPlus she is acting like a child. Regardless of what SHE thinks of your mum (and I bet she hates her due to feeling jealous and insecure) she should have the sense to know that YOU are close to your mum and she should be respectful about her to avoid hurting your feelings.\n\nBut she doesn't care about your feelings, only her own.\n\nIt is tragic that she lost her child, but you and your siblings are not a replacement, and its telling that she only really started trying after she lost him. She just wants to FEEL like a parent, but she has done nothing to earn that relationship. You cant NAKE people see you like a parent.\n\nYou're allowed to have a dance with whoever you want. Sone people enjoy very close relationships with their step parents, but that did not happen here. Since she's never stepped into a maternal role with you, it makes perfect sense that you dont want to indulge her with a dance and pretend she is on equal footing with your mother.\n\nIt sounds like that's what bothers her, the feeling of \"losing out\" to your mum.", "Skimmed it, but pretty obviously NTA. It's simple, Anne's not your mom. She doesn't *deserve* anything.", "NTA -  for one it is YOUR wedding and no one can tell you how to celebrate it. Second if she is openly that disrespectful to your biological mom you are completely in the right to deny this to her. In my eyes it would be an AH move towards your bio mom if you did do this.", "NTA. Someone else's demands are not your responsibility. She is not your mother but oddly enough your mother is. That's why you're doing a mother/son dance with her. She's lucky she's even getting invited.", "NTA. I do think that this is a really tragic situation because she wasn\u2019t able to develop any sort of relationship with you, because her kid was terminally ill.  It sounds like she wasn\u2019t present for a lot of i your relationship. I feel very badly for her because of what she went through. No parent should ever bury their child and the pain must be unimaginable. \n\nHer comment about your mom is totally wrong but I can also understand how she turned her grief into anger towards your mom for taking you away when he died. It\u2019s wrong to put that on you, and stick you in the middle of it. \n\nit sounds like she needs a massive amount of grief therapy. \n\nI think the real AH is your dad for rushing this marriage after you met. He was the one to choose how you integrated. So many parents believe their protecting their kids by withholding the meeting of the new SO. If this is the reason you\u2019re not close to her as you say, this kinda lies with him because it was his choice to make. He probably thought he was doing the right thing, but obviously he fucked up here. \n\nAnd Anne is also an AH for not being able to recognize that you don\u2019t have the relationship needed to have a \u2018mother\u2019/son dance. You can\u2019t be her surrogate son if the relationship isn\u2019t there.\n\nAll in all, a perfect storm of unfortunate, yet understandable, events that culminated to where you are today.", "Nta. You don\u2019t know her and she hates your mom. She doesn\u2019t know you and she doesn\u2019t deserve this.", "NTA at the end of the day it's your wedding, your plans.", "NTA. \n\nShe sounds toxic. Broken and toxic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If there is no real relationship, there's no real reason for the dance. Just Bein married to a child's parent doesn't give you a relationship with that child. Heck, even being a parent doesn't mean a good relationship with your child. The relationship needs to be formed and molded with years of caring, communication, and being there for your child. She lost a child, which is very sad, but that doesn't mean she's owed a replacement, or that you have to take on that role.", "You're NTA for not wanting to dance with your step mother, but I feel like there is a lot of emotional trauma here that needs to be unpacked. It sounds like, as kids, you were put in an impossible 'mom versus the interloper' kind of situation (since your dad didn't really handle introductions all that well or slowly) and it's caused there to be a distance between you and your step mother. Compound that with her own grief and trauma over her son, and the weird 'transference' she seems to be trying to go for and the whole situation is just sad.\n\nYou don't 'owe' her anything and you're right that relationships take work from both parties - so you say she should have 'tried harder' but how hard did you and your siblings try? She was left alone to mourn her own child and that creates so much hurt - you already said she was bitter - but she was probably deeply deeply hurt. I know you were kids and kids don't think about people's feelings. Lack of maturity and all that, but you aren't kids any more. \n\nPerhaps you need to either consider family therapy, and explain to her how her hostility towards your mom is harming your relationship with her?\n\nYou also have an opportunity here to repair some of the damage here but I think there has been a lot of hurt and poorly handled step-family dynamics that you need to all share your feelings in a safe way. It sounds like you resent her and her son for 'invading' your life - you describe time without her as 'normal' implying that time with her is 'abnormal'.\n\nI think you all need counselling tbh. There has been too much that has gone on for this to be a straight up 'yes or no' AITA judgement. I don't think you're the AH for not wanting to do a 'mother son' dance - it's your wedding, but I think the underlying reasons for the request and your refusal are more complex and it wouldn't be right to brand your SM an AH in this scenario.", "Nta", "NTA. She\u2019s not your mother.", "NTA. Her reaction is so bizarre!", "NTA.  You are not a replacement piece in the puzzle of her life.", "I think she expected that once we weren't hostile when we met her, that we would grow fast love for her and her son and wouldn't need to get to know them before living together and that she'd give him a fuller family. I think she still believes a love could have formed super fast and that I would see her as a parent/mother figure.", "When I said time with mom was normal, I mean it was. When Anne's son was sick things were not the same, because of course they weren't. Anne was either not there with her son and dad was on the phone to her most of the time after work or when they were there, the focus was on making her son comfortable, about needing to not make so much noise and stuff. We didn't have anything change at mom's during that time.", "I also have great sympathy for your step bro - he was probably very unhappy - between his own familial upheaval and suddenly having to live with 3 other siblings who were, at best, indifferent, and doing this while terminally ill as well, it sounds like he went through a rough time too. And that wasn't his fault any more than it was yours.", "Exactly - and that upheaval will have left lasting trauma on you and your siblings. This whole situation is very sad and was poorly handled from the start. I don't think it's fair to demonise your SM but her hostility towards your mom isn't helping her cause. I think you all need some family therapy because a lot of the damage runs deep here.", "It wasn't. I feel bad for the kid because he was 4 when we met him, but he knew our dad pretty much all his life, but never lived with him. Then suddenly he did and three older kids were there part time who didn't love his mom, didn't love him, didn't instantly regard him as family and were awkward with the set up before he got sick and then he was sick and was back and forth from a hospital in a different state. It was a lot for him.", "I don't think family therapy will do much because there's no love or family feeling on the part of my siblings and I. To me she's nothing more than my dad's wife and I don't have very strong feelings for her to try and make us more than we are at this point in time."]}
