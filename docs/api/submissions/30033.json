It was my last week at the job and I was so done with customers, especially entitled customers, and especially entitled customers with kids they won't control. \n\nI was in the back room when one of the volunteers brought in a porcelain doll off the shop floor with the head smashed in. I asked them what happened and they said a customer's child hadn't realised it wasn't a toy and broken it. I took it that they hadn't offered to pay for the item, and I wasn't about to make them as I thought that would be quite aggressive, but I was quite upset that someone's donation had been smashed because a customer let their kid play with anything in a public space. It was not in the kids section btw. \n\nI had to deal with another customers for a good five minutes, and assumed that the previous customer would have left. So I said to the volunteer, kind of to make a point in front of other customers I'll admit, that I wished people would offer to pay for things they break because after all it is for charity. \nLittle did I know that the woman was actually standing really close by, and she said \"oh, I can pay for it if you like\". I just smiled and said something like oh sorry, don't worry about it and went back to the back room carrying this doll. I was so embarrassed! A part of me thought maybe if she was embarrassed she would not do it in the future in other shops, but I think that was just to justify my own actions and try and avoid the anxiety over it.\n\nIt was an accident but I feel I should have behaved in a better way and not felt the need to call out someone who I didn't even personally see do something wrong. It's not an excuse but I should say I deal with kids destroying products volunteers have worked for free to put together, check the pieces, clean and price, several times a day. Also shoplifters, people swapping price tags and ripping price tags off, and always demanding discounts. It's for charity.

Yeah, it was unprofessional to do it in front of customers, but that doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nSecondly, you didn't know she was right there. And as she offered to pay back for the damages, you turned her offer down with a smile. \n\nI think all things considered, you handled it nicely.", "NTA. Dealing with rude customers day in and day out is exhausting. We\u2019re human beings and we all make mistakes, and I wouldn\u2019t even say that the way you \u201ccalled out\u201d the customer was rude at all. If I were the customer, it would be uncomfortable.

Go easy on yourself, it happens", "Nta", "NTA\n\n\u2026 but you messed up by not checking to see who the customer was and asking them to pay for it. Your explanation that it is someone\u2019s donation going to waste is a good one that you could\u2019ve used to justify your request.\n\nI think grow some nerve to be able to confront people directly & politely. Don\u2019t be scared especially if you\u2019re the manager.", "I think it should be too, but I can really tell it's not any more as people don't even think anything of it.

That could've been someone's granny's doll or some doll someone loved but donated to help the charity. \n\nWhy wouldn't the mom offer immediately. \n\nUnless it was totally accidental (backing into a display for instance.)

As a teenager in a store in Central Europe, a carton of eggs slipped my hand and dropped.

I do put the more delicate toys on higher shelves lol.", "Well, I didn't know who the customer was who broke it. Otherwise I definitely wouldn't have said anything like that in front of them. It was an accident.", "Up to the manager's discretion.", "That makes it sound better lol, but I do wish I'd been more professional. Thank you though.", "Thank you. I do feel I handled the situation poorly and wish I hadn't, but we'll both survive I guess lol.", "Fwiw I think you have a big heart. A lot of people would not care how the person (in OP story) felt.", "> They usually don't have much and that's why they're there.\n\nThat is true, and also kind. \n\nFor what it might be worth, I do not think she sounded offended. So as far as her over hearing the part about 'you break it you buy it' (which used to be signs in shops!) I really feel, no harm done.", ">But yes, I could have acted differently there for sure, I'll admit that.\n\nI think you acted fine.\n\nI just wondered about it for the future, going forward.\n\nBut things happen. A bunch of donations might come in and the cases could be full.", "Grow up, they\u2019re right.  Being passive aggressive is so childish, especially when you acted nice towards them.  Two faced and being a coward at work, lol.  I\u2019m sure they\u2019re glad it was your last week.", "Accidents happen and that\u2019s exactly what this was. The fact that you feel bad about it proves that you\u2019re NTA", "That's fair. It was an unfortunate situation and I wish it hadn't happened.", "Then why would you be here asking about it?  It\u2019s not unfortunate to be rude and passive aggressive to customers.  It\u2019s a choice."]}
