Our company have standard templates or can build custom products for our customers. I\u2019m part of a team that installs, tests, and monitor custom products. \n\nRecently we did a 3 week out of state installation and test for a customer. During this period, my teammates rotated flying back home to visit their families. Because I\u2019m only one who\u2019s single and have no family, I volunteered to not rotate out and worked so that my teammates could have extra time with their families. I spent the entire 3 weeks working. We finished the installation and testing so we\u2019re all home now. However, we\u2019re in the monitoring phase which includes flying out on a moment\u2019s notice if something serious happens.\n\nMy manager and his boss (VP) noticed the work I put in and the rotations I skipped to get everything smoothly online so they commended and rewarded me with a week\u2019s paid time off for Xmas. \n\nThe situation is that a couple of teammates already had approved time off for Xmas. Now that I have that week off too, the monitoring falls on everyone else which means no one else will be able to take time off. When they found out I had that week off, they started to try to get me to switch. Some tried to bribe me with food and other stuff while others tried to beg. A couple of coworkers are telling me their families can\u2019t go to Xmas gathering because they can\u2019t get that time off. One person is telling me this might be her grandmother\u2019s last Xmas and she needs to take her kids to see their grandma.\n\nI\u2019m feeling really bad about it but I\u2019ve turned them all down. I don\u2019t have anything to do or anyone to spend Xmas with but I worked for 3 straight weeks and am burnt out.

Some of your colleagues managed to book their leave early enough to be approved. This time off is time off that you earned by stepping up, and that allowed your colleagues to spend time with their families. You already took more than one for the team to ensure that they could still see their families whilst getting the work done. This is your reward for that. Are they also asking the people who booked their leave early to swap with them or are they just asking you? I hate this societal expectation, that because you don't have kids you have to work every holiday. Childless people also like the holidays. Who knew?!?

TAKE IT! If your co workers needed to have the time off they should have put in for it before now. As a person without kids myself, I've been there when I was young and didnt stand up for myself.

If I read it correctly, they could have predicted that this might've happened.\n\nI think the 'This might be Grandma's last Christmas' is a guilt trip for sure.  \nI would ask if she was sick or anything. People dying is a sure way to get what you want as you don't want to be branded an AH  for saying no.  \nBut that co-worker could have asked for time off in this case. If she did and gave this as a reason, I would have had a hard time believing someone would have denied her that request for that reason. \n\nA lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on yours.

You\u2019re booked off. Sucks to be them. They are being very unprofessional by trying to bully you into giving your time up.", "NAH\n\nThis is personal so take with a grain of salt.  My mom worked for a company where she often was screwed out of her vacation because she didn't have seniority. Growing up I never saw her for any holiday, cause she never got off. \n\nAs an adult I have zero patience for that shit. \n\nThis whole situation was created by management they are TA.   \nIf this were me, I'd probably go to HR and say how this isn't an appropriate way to treat employees and work on having a new policy in place.  \nAdditionally I'd start shopping around for a new job, because personally this isn't acceptable. You getting time off shouldn't effect other peoples ability to get vacation.  Management need better management.  \n\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you.  This kind of thing really irks me.

NTA.\n\nHowever, you could consider talking to your boss about how this can mess up the workplace. Consider taking a different week off to keep the peace, but that's up to you. You'd essentially be doing it as a favor to the administration, who messed up, and to keep the peace at the work place.", "It\u2019s not your responsibility and you\u2019re NTA for taking the time you earned.  if I were in your shoes I\u2019d try to give my time to the family with grandmother\u2019s \u201clast visit\u201d **if** there was some basis other than \u201cShe\u2019s old\u201d.

End ETA\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not an ahole, but your bosses - while well-meaning - are aholes. They created an unjust and negative situation.\n\nYour coworkers already had requested and received approval for time off at Christmas. It was horribly wrong of your bosses to schedule a bonus vacation for you at exactly the time that your vacation would require others to give up their PLANNED vacations. And these vacations are the kind that involve coordinating with other family members and doing things that can't just be postponed to a week or month later. I'm sorry but your bosses sound really inept!\n\nI absolutely do not condone 'familied' coworkers pressuring a single person to give up their rightful vacation time. This is slightly different.\n\n1. Your coworkers are being forced to give up their planned vacation time in order for you to receive a surprise bonus vacation time.\n2. If this unexpected bonus gave you the chance to do something you couldn't do at any other time, I'd think differently... but your plans for this time involve things you could a week or two later.\n3. So I suggest, in this specific case, you go to your bosses and tell them that you very much appreciate the bonus vacation time. You realize that it would require your coworkers losing their planned vacation time. You suggest that you take your bonus vacation time off the week after so that your coworkers can keep their original vacation plans.\n\nYou are not an ahole for wanting to take a bonus that you received; your coworkers are not aholes for wanting to keep the vacations they had planned and that involve their extended families. Your bosses created the problem. It's not your responsibility to fix it, but it seems like you can - without any real loss to you. I hope it can work out well for everyone.", "Tough situation.
