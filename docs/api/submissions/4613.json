Our company have standard templates or can build custom products for our customers. I\u2019m part of a team that installs, tests, and monitor custom products. \n\nRecently we did a 3 week out of state installation and test for a customer. During this period, my teammates rotated flying back home to visit their families. Because I\u2019m only one who\u2019s single and have no family, I volunteered to not rotate out and worked so that my teammates could have extra time with their families. I spent the entire 3 weeks working. We finished the installation and testing so we\u2019re all home now. However, we\u2019re in the monitoring phase which includes flying out on a moment\u2019s notice if something serious happens.\n\nMy manager and his boss (VP) noticed the work I put in and the rotations I skipped to get everything smoothly online so they commended and rewarded me with a week\u2019s paid time off for Xmas. \n\nThe situation is that a couple of teammates already had approved time off for Xmas. Now that I have that week off too, the monitoring falls on everyone else which means no one else will be able to take time off. When they found out I had that week off, they started to try to get me to switch. Some tried to bribe me with food and other stuff while others tried to beg. A couple of coworkers are telling me their families can\u2019t go to Xmas gathering because they can\u2019t get that time off. One person is telling me this might be her grandmother\u2019s last Xmas and she needs to take her kids to see their grandma.\n\nI\u2019m feeling really bad about it but I\u2019ve turned them all down. I don\u2019t have anything to do or anyone to spend Xmas with but I worked for 3 straight weeks and am burnt out. I had plans to binge shows and play games which makes me feel even more guilty.\n\nAm I TA for refusing to switch?", "created_utc": 1670930468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zktbwk/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_xmas_time_off_to/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Christmas isn\u2019t a surprise. If this was so important to people then they should\u2019ve requested time off in advance so that management would know and then offered you something else as compensation for working 3 weeks straight.

Do what you need to do OP & Happy Holidays!\u2764\ufe0f", "Definitely NTA. If they had plans then they should have booked it off before now. It's their fault for leaving it too late. Some of your colleagues managed to book their leave early enough to be approved. This time off is time off that you earned by stepping up, and that allowed your colleagues to spend time with their families. You already took more than one for the team to ensure that they could still see their families whilst getting the work done. This is your reward for that. Are they also asking the people who booked their leave early to swap with them or are they just asking you? I hate this societal expectation, that because you don't have kids you have to work every holiday. Childless people also like the holidays. Who knew?!? Enjoy your time off, you earned it, and maybe next year people will learn that if they want specific time off they need to book it off early and not try and guilt trip people into switching.", "What a toxic work environment where co-workers tries to guilt trap you\n\nNta of course", "NTA\n\nYou did not decide to get time off the management did that. So tell your coworks to take it up with them and to get off your back.\nAlso write your management about the situation and tell them that you did not agree with them if you want to keep the week off.\n\nYour coworkers are TAH because they had time with their family when they were back at home while you stayed for 3 weeks.\nWhy should their decision to reproduce affect you just because you are single?", "NTA as your manager rewarded you with time off over Christmas. You said it yourself; you're burnt out. Prioritise your well-being and enjoy the break.\n\nYour colleagues can take their grievances up with the manager or boss and work out their holidays with them. It's their problem, not yours.", "NTA. If a coworker is genuinely experiencing a family emergency, they can speak with your manager to figure things out. You have no obligation to \"trade\" the PTO that you earned. OP, enjoy your break. It sounds like you've earned it.", "NTA. Tell them to take it up with the manager. It was their decision, not yours", "NTA...it sounds like you can  use the time off. How do you even choose who is most in need? These people know the challenges and frustrations of the job, but still choose to do it. Their issues are not your problem.", "Nope nope NTA. Even your bosses think you should have the time off. TAKE IT! If your co workers needed to have the time off they should have put in for it before now. As a person without kids myself, I've been there when I was young and didnt stand up for myself. Now I just say screw you. I deserve holidays off just as much as anyone with kids.", "NTA. You worked when others didn't.  If I read it correctly, they could have predicted that this might've happened.\n\nI think the 'This might be Grandma's last Christmas' is a guilt trip for sure.  \nI would ask if she was sick or anything. People dying is a sure way to get what you want as you don't want to be branded an AH  for saying no.  \nBut that co-worker could have asked for time off in this case. If she did and gave this as a reason, I would have had a hard time believing someone would have denied her that request for that reason. \n\nA lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on yours. Also, sometimes people get off for Christmas and other times people have to work.", "NTA, you\u2019ve been used long enough.  That worker\u2019s grandma may have gotten a visit during the installation phase; regardless, not your problem.  I really hope your bosses have your back, but considering the leave they gave you, they do.  Don\u2019t give in, you deserve your time off, period.", "NTA, even if you wanted to give up your time for someone, how could you possibly choose between employees? That would open up a big can of worms with everyone!", "Completely NTA, but I can't say the same with your bosses. \n\nIf your coworkers have already booked a vacation, they need to take this time off as the company previously approved. \n\nI think the manager and the boss should be the only ones working only change an approved vacation time if it is more than 1 or 2 months of advice.\n\nIn my opinion, the manager and the boss should be the only ones working.", "NTA. Either it was your bosses' oversight to send you on time off while you were the last one in office, or somebody just handed in their time-off slip too late. That being said, you get to take care of yourself, if you feel burnt out and not ready to switch with somebody, that's your well earned right. If it's that much of a pressing matter, they could ask their other colleagues, strangely enough, they all seem to be coming to you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't choose to be off, your bosses gave it to you.

Enjoy your shows and games.", "NTA, your coworkers should have realized this when you worked 3 weeks straights.  That would have been the time to trade with you.", "You're a person, not a robot. Your time off matters too, enjoy it! You could white lie and tell them you have plans to get them to stop asking. Sorry your coworkers think their time is more valuable than yours.", "Don't change. Ypur coworkers should be better organised. Million of people do this all over the world without issue", "NTA. Go and enjoy your vacation! You deserve it!", "NTA. I'm wondering how many people actually read the story and understand it based on their responses. So people that already had requested PTO and you are getting the time off but nobody else can get PTO now. That is not your problem everybody has a sob story when they want something. You earned it this is your time off do not feel bad for taking something that is yours. Your coworkers who did not put in PTO ahead of time or do not have it available they need to take it up with management. Not you. Or call in sick", "NTA, point blank", "NTA. Your bosses are, though. Because the week paid was an unexpected gift, and they shouldn\u2019t have given it on such a crazy week, which interfered with others\u2019 already approved PTO. \n\nYou didn\u2019t work them for the week off. If they wanted to give you a week off, it should have been one that didn\u2019t interfere with revoking someone\u2019s approved PTO.\n\nIf they gave you that week off, it should have also come with appropriate cover. What they actually did, was make you somehow look like the bad guy. Rescinding PTO is a straight up AH move.\n\nEdit: I misread OP, no approved PTO. \n\nStill N t a though.", "NTA. You need to look after yourself and you've earned your time off.", "NTA.    why didn't  these other co workers take vacation  over Christmas?", "NTA this is not a you problem,this is a management problem. Refer all enquiries to management. I dont care what the stories are that they are telling you,that was up to them to negotiation with management", "NTA, it sounds like the people complaining to you are the ones who did not schedule in advance. You reached the max quota for time off in that time frame. Therfore,  it is your time off. \n\nIf they are going to harrass you,  bring it to management. You should not be made to feel bad because you are doing actual rest for a week. No kids is not a reason to give up a holiday.", "Nta. You put in the work and your BOSSES rewarded you with time off. I say this as a parent now: DON\u2019T GIVE IN!!", "NTA.  They should have planned their leave well in advance.  That\u2019s on them.", "Being burnt out and needing time to recover is just as valid and important as anything your coworkers have going on. Absolutely NTA", "NTA. They should have requested the time off sooner. I\u2019m so sick of the of entitlement of parents in the workplace. They need to take it up with Management, not with you.", "NTA if it was known that grandmother had a very short few weeks left then I'd be sympathetic.\n\nYou've already given them your time off once, if you give more then you'll be the office soft touch and you will never get any time off, any that you do you will be harassed to give up to someone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re booked off. Sucks to be them. They are being very unprofessional by trying to bully you into giving your time up.", "NAH\n\nThis is personal so take with a grain of salt.  My mom worked for a company where she often was screwed out of her vacation because she didn't have seniority. Growing up I never saw her for any holiday, cause she never got off. \n\nAs an adult I have zero patience for that shit. \n\nThis whole situation was created by management they are TA.   \nIf this were me, I'd probably go to HR and say how this isn't an appropriate way to treat employees and work on having a new policy in place.  \nAdditionally I'd start shopping around for a new job, because personally this isn't acceptable. You getting time off shouldn't effect other peoples ability to get vacation.  Management need better management.  \n\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you.  This kind of thing really irks me.  Everyone need times off for their mental health, and management put you in the cross fire and that is not cool.", "What's wrong with the team leaders? How can they give so many people time off at the same time? They have created the mess.\n\nIf your team mates have approved time off already, they have the right to feel upset, but not with you.\n\nYou are ok since you did not request this- a reward for contributing. NTA.\n\nHowever, you could consider talking to your boss about how this can mess up the workplace. Consider taking a different week off to keep the peace, but that's up to you. You'd essentially be doing it as a favor to the administration, who messed up, and to keep the peace at the work place.", "It\u2019s not your responsibility and you\u2019re NTA for taking the time you earned.  if I were in your shoes I\u2019d try to give my time to the family with grandmother\u2019s \u201clast visit\u201d **if** there was some basis other than \u201cShe\u2019s old\u201d. Is she sick?", "NTA but if they already had their leave approved it shouldn't be cancelled, don't be surprised if they complain to management", "You are not an ahole, but your bosses - while well-meaning - are aholes. They created an unjust and negative situation.\n\nYour coworkers already had requested and received approval for time off at Christmas. It was horribly wrong of your bosses to schedule a bonus vacation for you at exactly the time that your vacation would require others to give up their PLANNED vacations. And these vacations are the kind that involve coordinating with other family members and doing things that can't just be postponed to a week or month later. I'm sorry but your bosses sound really inept!\n\nI absolutely do not condone 'familied' coworkers pressuring a single person to give up their rightful vacation time. This is slightly different.\n\n1. Your coworkers are being forced to give up their planned vacation time in order for you to receive a surprise bonus vacation time.\n2. If this unexpected bonus gave you the chance to do something you couldn't do at any other time, I'd think differently... but your plans for this time involve things you could a week or two later.\n3. So I suggest, in this specific case, you go to your bosses and tell them that you very much appreciate the bonus vacation time. You realize that it would require your coworkers losing their planned vacation time. You suggest that you take your bonus vacation time off the week after so that your coworkers can keep their original vacation plans.\n\nYou are not an ahole for wanting to take a bonus that you received; your coworkers are not aholes for wanting to keep the vacations they had planned and that involve their extended families. Your bosses created the problem. It's not your responsibility to fix it, but it seems like you can - without any real loss to you. I hope it can work out well for everyone.", "Tough situation. I\u2019d say NTA. If u do it for one, everybody else will be mad at you. If you can get the following week off, you might want to do it for the woman with the dying grandma", "INFO: If you\u2019re not planning to do anything holiday-related, could you move up your intended time off?
