Our company have standard templates or can build custom products for our customers. I\u2019m part of a team that installs, tests, and monitor custom products. \n\nRecently we did a 3 week out of state installation and test for a customer. During this period, my teammates rotated flying back home to visit their families. Because I\u2019m only one who\u2019s single and have no family, I volunteered to not rotate out and worked so that my teammates could have extra time with their families. I spent the entire 3 weeks working. We finished the installation and testing so we\u2019re all home now. However, we\u2019re in the monitoring phase which includes flying out on a moment\u2019s notice if something serious happens.\n\nMy manager and his boss (VP) noticed the work I put in and the rotations I skipped to get everything smoothly online so they commended and rewarded me with a week\u2019s paid time off for Xmas. \n\nThe situation is that a couple of teammates already had approved time off for Xmas. Now that I have that week off too, the monitoring falls on everyone else which means no one else will be able to take time off. When they found out I had that week off, they started to try to get me to switch. Some tried to bribe me with food and other stuff while others tried to beg. A couple of coworkers are telling me their families can\u2019t go to Xmas gathering because they can\u2019t get that time off. One person is telling me this might be her grandmother\u2019s last Xmas and she needs to take her kids to see their grandma.\n\nI\u2019m feeling really bad about it but I\u2019ve turned them all down. I don\u2019t have anything to do or anyone to spend Xmas with but I worked for 3 straight weeks and am burnt out.

Some of your colleagues managed to book their leave early enough to be approved. This time off is time off that you earned by stepping up, and that allowed your colleagues to spend time with their families. You already took more than one for the team to ensure that they could still see their families whilst getting the work done. This is your reward for that. Are they also asking the people who booked their leave early to swap with them or are they just asking you? I hate this societal expectation, that because you don't have kids you have to work every holiday. Childless people also like the holidays. Who knew?!?

People dying is a sure way to get what you want as you don't want to be branded an AH  for saying no.  \nBut that co-worker could have asked for time off in this case. If she did and gave this as a reason, I would have had a hard time believing someone would have denied her that request for that reason. \n\nA lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on yours.

Growing up I never saw her for any holiday, cause she never got off. \n\nAs an adult I have zero patience for that shit. \n\nThis whole situation was created by management they are TA.   \nIf this were me, I'd probably go to HR and say how this isn't an appropriate way to treat employees and work on having a new policy in place.  \nAdditionally I'd start shopping around for a new job, because personally this isn't acceptable. You getting time off shouldn't effect other peoples ability to get vacation.  Management need better management.  \n\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you.  This kind of thing really irks me.

NTA.\n\nHowever, you could consider talking to your boss about how this can mess up the workplace. Consider taking a different week off to keep the peace, but that's up to you.

End ETA\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not an ahole, but your bosses - while well-meaning - are aholes. They created an unjust and negative situation.\n\nYour coworkers already had requested and received approval for time off at Christmas. It was horribly wrong of your bosses to schedule a bonus vacation for you at exactly the time that your vacation would require others to give up their PLANNED vacations. And these vacations are the kind that involve coordinating with other family members and doing things that can't just be postponed to a week or month later. I'm sorry but your bosses sound really inept!\n\nI absolutely do not condone 'familied' coworkers pressuring a single person to give up their rightful vacation time. This is slightly different.\n\n1. Your coworkers are being forced to give up their planned vacation time in order for you to receive a surprise bonus vacation time.\n2. If this unexpected bonus gave you the chance to do something you couldn't do at any other time, I'd think differently... but your plans for this time involve things you could a week or two later.\n3. So I suggest, in this specific case, you go to your bosses and tell them that you very much appreciate the bonus vacation time. You realize that it would require your coworkers losing their planned vacation time. You suggest that you take your bonus vacation time off the week after so that your coworkers can keep their original vacation plans.\n\nYou are not an ahole for wanting to take a bonus that you received; your coworkers are not aholes for wanting to keep the vacations they had planned and that involve their extended families. Your bosses created the problem. It's not your responsibility to fix it, but it seems like you can - without any real loss to you. I hope it can work out well for everyone.", "Tough situation.

Otherwise why is it a sudden issue two weeks before hand?", "Grandparent's last Christmas is almost certainly a manipulation. My husband has been guilted into attending holidays for like the last 5 years because his grandparents are old and \"it might be one of their last\". It's going to continue for the next 5-10 years, and then we can be guilted into attending holidays because his parents are getting old.", ">That would solve everyone's problems at the same time.\n\nReally? Op's job is to solve everyone's problem but their's because they aren't married with kids? They have no grandma to see? They don't want to hang with their family during the holidays? Wow.", "That would be messed up if it did and I would file a complaint with the higher ups or the state if that was the solution. Ultimately it is not their job to ensure their coworkers planned ahead. If they had plans over the holidays they should have asked for days off as soon as they knew or be an adult and suck it up. \n\nA lack of planning on their part does not make an emergency on OPs part.", ">The situation is that a couple of teammates already had approved time off for Xmas.\n\nIn understood with \"The situation is that a couple of teammates already had approved time off for Xmas.\" that those are the affected too. My bad if I misunderstood it, but JIC I defend that idea.", "Well, OP didn't ask for Christmas week, and hasn't indicated they'd prefer it to any other week off", "> I would file a complaint with the higher ups or the state if that was the solution\n\nThe higher ups the supervisor would be getting to screw you, and the higher ups you would be complaining to, would likely be the same higher ups.\n\nComplaining to the state? Maybe OP is in Australia and there's some kind of worker right that says you can't be denied a vacation you've already been promised, but when I hear \"out of state\" I presume the US, and filing a complaint with Ohio or California that your boss broke a promise isn't likely to lead anywhere.\n\n>If they had plans over the holidays they should have asked for days off as soon as they knew or be an adult and suck it up.\n\nYes, obviously. Alas, those with kids usually get kowtowed to.", "I read that as OP\u2019s week off combined with other pre-approved time off meant that there were no additional slots for time off for others who didn\u2019t plan ahead.", "The next sentence is, \u201cnow that I have that time off too.\u201d It makes me think their time off wasn\u2019t changed, just that other people that didn\u2019t think they would be on call are now on call.", "Maybe they do nothing or maybe they overrule but the answer is always no until you ask. If they did that to me I would start seriously looking for a new job because regardless of their plans good bosses don\u2019t treat their employees that way.", "Well, as I said, it was misunderstood by my side. But some companies will not hesitate in do something like this, which makes me think about this.\n\nBTW, I'm not a native English speaker. I get it, and I make a mistake. But he is still NTA.", "Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm frankly surprised that OP's company even recognized effort in the first place, so perhaps there's hope. \n\nBut the sad fact is that most people in the world either have or want families, and when someone with a family comes with a family problem, they're going to identify with them more than the single kidless folks. So when you ask the CEO or whatever to \"fix\" the situation, there's a good chance the head honcho is only going to be thinking of how *they* would feel about missing xmas with their family, not really worrying about equity or fairness overall.\n\nIt's similar to how many \"Grandparents' Rights\" cases go awry to established law: judges are mostly old men. Old men see a grandparent unable to see a grandchild and they identify with that, regardless of what the abuse situation or whatever is.", "NTA.  take your well-deserved time off. It's your boss's problem, not yours.\n\nOn another note, I'm sick of people with children always believing they get special privileges over people without children. I am childless by choice.  My former employer always managed to give perks to coworkers with children over those without.   Time off was one, and it was a bone of contention with me. My boss let my cop worker go home early because they had to pick up their kid from day care.  I needed to leave early to go see my sick mother in the hospital and was told no.  I left anyway.  She wrote me up, I went to HR and blew up the mess.   The outcome: the write-up was rescinded, no more favoring children over childless, and they avoided a major lawsuit for discrimination.  My mother passed away 15 days later in the hospital. \n\nStand up for your rights!", "NTA\n\nYou covered for your teammates and got rewarded. That's your reward, not theirs. If the individual with a grandmother that is not well really needs to go see her, she can request for time or talk to your supervisor/manager/director. I think spending Christmas binge watching shows sounds awesome. Don't feel bad! Enjoy your XMAS!", "YTA. They already had approved time off. That\u2019s pretty shitty of your company too honestly.\n\nYou don\u2019t have anywhere to go or anyone to see. You absolutely deserve the time off but it can be another week. Honestly I\u2019d milk it and take the bribes. \ud83d\ude09", "Nta. You worked hard and deserve a break. Have a nice holiday and enjoy your paid vacation", "As someone with a kid who needs to take time off around holidays because of their school break, NTA. \n\nYour coworker's failure to plan ahead is not your mess to fix. I always ask for the days off I need well in advance. Luckily, at my current job, they've never had to deny anyone's PTO request. At least not in the last 25 years. \n\nAt my previous job last year, I could only ask 2 weeks in advance, because that's when they do scheduling. I didn't get all the days I needed. Did I try and bribe coworkers who did and bitch when they said no? No.\nI sucked it up like an adult and figured shit out. \n\nI'll say it again: her failure to plan ahead and ask for days off as soon as possible is not your mess to fix. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Christmas falls on the same day every year. They should've requested off in advance.", "NTA. Your boss\u2019s gave you the time because they recognized how hard you\u2019ve been working. \n\nYour coworkers failure to plan ahead and ask for this time off earlier simply isn\u2019t your problem.", "It's December, they didn't request time off for \"Last Xmas with Grandma\" months ago? They didn't ask until they found out you got the time off. NTA. Your manager and VP knew the schedule when they gave you the time off.", "NTA- you are not the AH for taking your earned time off. And I would not offer to make any concessions to anyone who has mistreated you over this.\n\nI will say- I'm guessing if the other workers knew that accepting your offer on the 3 week stint to cover their rotations was going to cost them Christmas, they would not have accepted. So while you also were not plotting for this to happen, your management has put you in a tough spot. If you WANT to address this, maybe speak to your management and say- look- I wasn't trying to take away everyone's Christmas. And I do appreciate the PTO, but could we schedule it differently so that the other workers don't feel like I took advantage of them by doing the extra work before to be the only one off during Christmas?", "Nta, you all ready help them by working 3 weeks in a row, your coworkers don't care s**t about you. I bet they enjoyed their free time with their families, and didn't give a thought to you working.\n\nSo, be selfish for once, and enjoy your well-earned free time, you deserved it.", "NTA you Earned the time of by being extremely considerate and flexible. \n\nIt\u2019s time these people show the very minimum  of consideration by not bugging you about your well earned reward.", "NTA but your boss is for not thinking ahead. They should have reviewed schedules to see what kind of coverage they would have before offering you that. Your boss is the asshole.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to provide time off for your colleagues, it's your company's responsibility. Don't let them guilt you into giving up what sounds like a well-earned vacation.", "NTA.  There are other staff members who have approved time off. They can change with one of them if needed. You Earned yours so they could have more family time. Enjoy your well-deserved time off, and don't feel even one guilty twinge.", "NTA- just because you don\u2019t have a partner or kids or whatever doesn\u2019t mean your time is any less valuable, and I say that as someone who is married with a kid. You are 100% in the right here. You had plans and those are just as important as your coworkers plans.", "NTA\n\nYour bosses would be the AH's but this story sounds real fake cause why would your bosses randomly decide to create this huge problem for everyone including themselves? They could have just given you a nice bonus or given you extra time off at a later date when they have coverage.", "NTA\n\nYou were given the specific week off. Take it.", "NTA\n\nThey took advantage of you having no family for that work trip. Now that you have been given the week as acknowledgment of your good work they want to take advantage again.\n\nDon't let them.", "NTA.", "Or to insist on working their SCHEDULED TIME!!!  instead they stuck OP with all the install, took his scheduled home break and now want more....  I would lol right in their faces.", "Why?", "If granny is dying then she needs to speak to her manager, not harass OP. Heck she can just call off.", "Coworkers should've requested off in advance like the others did. Thats on them for waiting until the last minute.", "The people who already requested off keep their days off. New people just can't request off now. Smh", "I bet grandma has Christmas Cancer", "Thank you for clearing up my misread of the post. Then, of course, OP should keep the holiday!", "Exactly.  Most families tend to do the same things every year..... it's not like the holidays changed dates. I always requested off months in advance. \nNow of course that doesn't apply to the grandmother (although I had a coworker whose grandmother's last Christmas was every year for 8 years). It's the supervisor's responsibility to ensure coverage.\n\nNTA. This was a reward/appreciation for OP's hard work. Enjoy it.", "Is that life-threatening?", "No worries!"]}
