Can you come to a compromise by asking her to take on more of the cooking and cleaning to see if it is really for her? Do a test run where she cooks two nights a week and does just the laundry or something. That way, you get the load lessened for you and she can see if she can learn to like cooking and cleaning. \n\nThat said, MOST people don\u2019t like cooking and cleaning. Part of being an adult is doing it anyway. It seems like you are being taken advantage of.", "NTA  You told your wife your honest opinion, and from what you've written here it seems like you have very good reasons for that opinion.\n\nHow about wife stays at work, you take the promotion and hire a cleaner? and/or maybe take laundry out to be washed/dried?  Even if just for a few months until you all adjust to the new demands of your job.\n\nI stayed home with my kids for a year bc my daughter was pretty ill.

Look, I\u2019m a SAHM who hates cooking and cleaning and I\u2019ve been a SAHM since my oldest was born. I do clean because I *must*, but my husband and I still split it. I take on 95% of the mental load. I keep everyone\u2019s schedule and I\u2019m in charge of making sure everyone is where they need to be (even if that\u2019s telling my husband when to drive our 5yo to soccer practice). I fill out all the forms. I do all the doctor appointments. When we have sick kids (my kids have missed a combined 17 days of school this year so far), my husband\u2019s work isn\u2019t affected because I\u2019m at home with them. I do a thousand things that my husband probably doesn\u2019t even know about because it\u2019s off his plate. There are massive benefits to a SAH spouse *IF* you can afford it, both partners are on board, and you both divide up household tasks fairly (not equally because it can\u2019t be equal when one person doesn\u2019t have an outside job). You\u2019re NTA for not being on board right away (or even if you decide not to take the promotion) and your wife is NTA for wanting to try this out. I think she should do a trial of it, though.

No need to lose her income.", "NTA This is a huge change, you need to be able to have a conversation about how realistic the idea is. You should also be able to talk about other options - like will your new job pay more so you can get an au pair?  Or cleaning people?  There are ways to make your lives easier while still working.

You\u2019re being completely dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIf YOU don\u2019t want her to be a SAHM because you don\u2019t like that dynamic, say so. That\u2019s a valid preference. However, the way you\u2019re trying to mainsplain to your wife what her preferences are is gross. If YOU don\u2019t want the promotion because you don\u2019t want the stress, be honest. There\u2019s no shame in being happy where you are. Own your choices and stop this weird dynamic of blaming your wife and overriding her preferences because *you know better*.", "NAH, but I would ask her to do a trial run and take over doing half the cleaning and cooking while you both work to see if it's really something she wants to keep up with.  \n\nThe upside to this is no matter what you'd be less stressed going into a new promotion. \n\nAnd if it's not something she ends up wanting to spend her time doing,  with your promotion and you both working you might be able to hire a cleaning service to take some of the load off.", "ESH - I sense some subtext here. OP doesn\u2019t want to take on a more stressful job partly because he suspects he\u2019ll also keep having to bear the brunt of the household tasks. He\u2019ll resent his wife for  not doing everything because she\u2019s home all day and not bringing in income. He\u2019s trying to talk her out of it not because she\u2019ll hate it, but because he\u2019s annoyed that she won\u2019t change and he\u2019ll be on the hook for double work.  He may also be afraid of change, added responsibility, increased stress, all of which accompany a promotion. If he pins his refusal to take on all of this on his wife, he doesn\u2019t have to own it or feel guilty. \n\nOn the other hand, the fact that OP\u2019s wife is so eager to be a SAHM when she hates housework suggests that she\u2019s sick of having a job outside the home and sees this as a golden opportunity to quit.  Since she\u2019s unlikely to start loving domesticity at this stage, I\u2019d say she\u2019s excited by the prospect of having the house to herself sometimes and not having a commute or work stress.  \n\nOP can\u2019t win here, unfortunately.  His wife is already punishing him with the narrative that he\u2019s insulting her, and if he\u2019s not a Neanderthal, he can\u2019t *forbid* her from quitting if he takes the new job. If he turns down more money to stay status quo, he might as well move out - that relationship\u2019s poisoned. She\u2019ll think he\u2019s either slacking or doing an end run to keep her in the work force and her respect will go out the window.", "NTA..calling a spade a spade.", "NAH- It's a difficult arrangement to jump into so you are well within reason to hesitate. Personally I suggest you take the promotion and let her pursue being a SAHM. Like any job there will be a learning curve and she will begin to feel more competent in her new duties. My Fiancee was put out of work in early 2020 and hasn't worked since. She has started new hobbies, began her at-home cookbook, eagerly takes on cleaning tasks and generally makes our apartment feel like a home. All of which are things I would say she was POOR at while she was working throughout the beginning of our relationship. \n\nAll that being said I am sure there are more factors in play for the two of you so may I instead suggest making a good old Pros/Cons list? Don't do it in one sitting, start it and for 24-72 hours let it accumulate, have your wife do the same and convene at the end of that time period.", "NAH. This isn't a decision to be taken lightly. Not everyone is cut out for everything and based on what you've said it sounds like your wife is going off on a bit of a whim. Is it possible she feels guilty not being able to spend as much time with the children as she would like to?", "Either one of two things are happening here and both of them make YTA.\n\nYou think you know best what your wife wants and what's best for your family without your wifes input OR  you don't want the promotion and you are trying to blame it on your wife somehow.\n\nShe's offering you a perfect solution and the opportunity to move up in the world and do better for your family.  It's fine if you think the promotion will be too stressful, but say that instead of trying to put your wife down for stepping up to the plate.", "YTA - If she tries it, and doesn't like it or it doesn't work, she can go back into the workforce.\n\nIts possible that you're not being honest with yourself about why you don't want to become the sole breadwinner, who has the financial responsibility for the entire family.", "YTA for over-riding her own opinions, and claiming that you know her and her feelings better than she does.  It's a very odd way to go about it- she suggested it, is really eager, says she wouldn't mind doing housework etc, but you feel the need to point out to her that she hates housework and loves her job.  It's quite infantilising and patronising.\n\nMaybe she will end up hating it, but that's her choice to try it.  She could ask for a sabbatical from her work?", "YTA. you can think/talk about her being a bad SAHM when she proves she is one. also if you need to work more how do you expect your wife to work and do all the stuff that you wont be able to do?!", "NAH  \n\n\nShe's upset with you because you're not communicating well and making her feel insecure.  \nYou're upset with her because you believe you are looking out for her.  \n\n\nYou also don't want that promotion, but are looking for an excuse to not take it. Re-evaluate that first.", "YTA- it seems like you are hiding behind saying what you don't think she will like and ignoring what she says she will like. Even if it turns out she hates it, that's her mistake to make. Now its fine to argue against her quitting her job for your own reasons- you don't want the stress of being the sole financial provider or you don't actually want your promotion, etc. And its fine to remind her to think it through and consider it more realistically. I just don't think its right for you to decide whats best for her when she disagrees. She's an adult too.\n\nI mean I was a stay at home mom from when my daughter was born until she went to school and I'm not domestic at all. I hate housework, but I still found it fulfilling to be home with my daughter and I handled the housework. I was ready to go back to work once she went to school and we've gone back to sharing the chores again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's all of the sick days, any household planning, kid's projects and events, doctor's visits, scheduling for everything, etc. It very quickly becomes a quasi single parent situation. At minimum you would need an aupair and house cleaner to try to offset the disruption. \n\nI don't think either of you are TA. It's hard to have to have a two full time working parents with young kids. I've got three that are now firmly in elementary and the juggling is still hard. Please understand her desire to be a SAHP is probably more wanting not to be stretched so thin. I'm not someone who would want to be a SAHP but I appreciate the dynamic now that I've lived the alternative.\n\nTalk it out throughly and maybe with a marriage counselor. My one word of warning is make sure you check in with her on where her stressors are, be on the lookout for disparity in what each of you are contributing towards the household/kids.

For your sake hope the job pays well enough for therapy because you will need it after you work your ass off and then come home and are expected to cook and clean too.", "It all depends on how you said it.  You get to have an opinion about how well your wife would cope with being a SAHM and you can and should test her, sensitively, on her assumptions about that.  But you can't patronise her.  And you can't tell her what to do.  Quitting her job is a big thing for her to do and you shouldn't assume she's doing it on a whim but you also need to be careful about such big life decisions.  If you have time to test run before committing to the promotion with her taking some leave, that would be ideal.  If you can't, and you'd like the promotion and she's still sure, then you should move forward her way because you shouldn't assume she'll fail.  \n\nIf it doesn't work then you will need to be able to find a different solution - another job for you or help around the house for her.  Communication is critical either way, and agreed ground rules.  Don't set her up for failure.", "All the way this, but it sounds like op us right.

She's not an asshole for thinking that will be possible without her job-- sometimes if a job is bad enough, the problem with keeping up with housework is that all your energy is going into your job. You could theoretically clean the kitchen even though you hate it, but you don't have the energy to spend on a hated task at home after performing hated tasks for 8 hours, and you would be able to power through 8 hours of hated tasks at home like you do right now at work.

For how you handled it. \n\nYour thoughts are valid. However, they are your opinions. You cannot predict the future. I don't like household chores, but I'm a SAHM and am a decent one in my opinion.

The second is either an or off the home gig or being what I can the homemaker or SAHParent. I'm the SAHP in my situation.\n\nBeing a SAHP is not easy. It's hard. It's taking care of a whole household. It's planning and cooking meals, grocery shopping, being the household secretary, making and keeping doctors appointments, consulting with the school (or running out of you homeschool). It's being a personal shopper for your kids, the finder of lost things. It's doing laundry that never stops pulling up, dishes that never seem to stop appearing. It's being a jack of all trades with no breaks while the kids are young and still at home full time. And all this while being judged by a society that thinks you're sitting on a couch drinking wine and spending your spouse's money. A society that seems to think that this is not \"work\".\n\nBefore committing to being a SAHP, your wife does need to think about the ENORMOUS lifestyle change. I wanted to be a SAHP ever since I was a kid. And I was NOT prepared for that change. It can feel isolating, especially at first when you go from being out of the home every day. Then you're at home with only your kids and eventually your spouse to talk to. You go from having set tasks to accomplish, with firm goals and end points, to a very open ended gig. Your tasks are rarely done before the kids (or spouse) undo it. Can she handle that? \n\nIf this is something she wants to do, sit down and talk to her. Ask her how she plans to tackle being a SAHM. Ask her to describe what a day in the life of a SAHM looks like. \n\nMany people suggested a trial period. That's a great idea. But as for you not lifting a finger? That's crap. You two work out set responsibilities. Clearly define who does what, just like you were doing before. Do a trial run and discuss what you BOTH liked and disliked. And go from there. \n\nIf you're opposed to the idea for reasons you haven't stated, then be honest with her. But if it's just a belief that you need to like doing household chores to be a good SAHP, please ask yourself... who does like doing them? Do you like everything you do at your job? Everything? There's always something at any job you don't enjoy 100%.\n\nHave the conversation. Do the trial run. Being a SAHP can be hugely rewarding for everyone involved.

Maybe you have a bunch of kids or complicated allergies  but not having time to shower while your kids are in school is not the norm.", "No. Not at all.", "Your dog doesn\u2019t make even a quarter of the mess of a child.", "My dude. I have known dogs who eat walls. If you think a dog is inherently tidier than a child, you have only known very well trained dogs who don\u2019t have any health conditions.", "As someone who stayed home for a few years, I agree that person's list of what could be done while kids were in school/day care for 6 hours makes SAHP look like incompetent morons. Either exaggerating or not including pertinent details that add to challenges doesn't help the conversation. it makes it even easier to dismiss stay at home parents. \n\nThere are real issues staying at home.\n\nLack of adult interaction is a huge one\n\nSetting back your career.\n\nLack of a sense of accomplishment/completion  (its never done)\n\npeople calling it \"relaxing\" or a \"vacation\". \n\ninequality with spouse/partner\n\nthis doesn't get mentioned enough but loss of self.   Being Mom/Dad taking over your personality.  and sometimes becoming a less interesting person.   I mean, \"what are your hobbies?\" , \"Well gee I colored and played with blocks all day\" or some version for years. \n\ncompletely discounting all the other stuff that lands on the stay at homes parents plate.  e.g  \"you're home so you can shop for working parent's family's birthday gifts and keep track of their birthdays oh and call my aunt too she likes to talk on the phone\".  , your home so you can deal with taking the cars to the shop, help my sister with errands for her wedding , take my dad to the Dr \"\n\n\"All you had to do was ask (if you need help)\" and \"How, was I supposed to know what kind of milk we drink?\"", "My kids go through 2 sets of clothes every day. They play dirty (literally, love grass, mud, messy painting) and eating still ends with stains. This, plus towels and bedding, makes 5-6 loads a week.", "Wait till they become smelly teenagers. Daily showers plus their daily school wear and then changing into pjs. I\u2019ve got two (ok one is technically preteen) and it adds up *quick*"]}
