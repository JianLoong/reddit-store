We decided due to societal stigma, she would carry the baby. We picked out a sperm donor and decided to do a closed donation. \n\nA couple weeks before the procedure, she had sex with her best friend and became pregnant. \n\nI found out about the cheating. And let her know I couldn\u2019t be with her, that she should leave my house. I didn\u2019t get nasty about it. I just calmly stayed away that weekend and had friends watch my house while her new boyfriend helped her move her things. \n\nLater, mutuals let me know she became pregnant from the affair. That they think I should step up as the trans guy, cause I should know family is about more than just DNA, and raise this baby as my own, especially since I wanted a baby and I make far more than the guy who is the biological father. That I\u2019m more emotionally mature, etc etc. \n\nMy ex believes I should also step up and adopt the baby. \n\nCommunity has shamed me for not wanting to raise the baby. I wish the baby well, but I am not that baby\u2019s father. And the incompetence of the father should\u2019ve been thought about when the affair happened. \n\nFriends believe that what my ex did was okay. But I don\u2019t think so. I think she violated trust and went outside our agreements. I didn\u2019t consent to this baby. I consented to a baby born through the in-vitro process. \n\nFriends have said it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I should love the baby no matter what. That even my ex will be a somewhat terrible parent so it\u2019s responsibility to make sure this baby grows up in a healthy environment. It\u2019s not that I wish this baby ill, it\u2019s just that I worry every time I see this baby\u2014I\u2019ll think of the affair. I wish I could say I have it in me to forgive my ex for what happened\u2014but I think it will forever be something that comes up if I raise that baby. \n\nI also think that I would spend lots of money in attorney fees for custody when I have a little chance I\u2019d be granted custody. She is with the new guy she cheated on me with. Any court will see them as the legitimate parents of the baby. They will just see a trans person and it won\u2019t matter the stability I have\u2014they will give the baby to the cis, seemingly straight couple over a single, trans adult. \n\nAITA for not fighting for custody and raising this baby? It\u2019s been eating at me and the guilt is heavy.", "created_utc": 1677156275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119wtl9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_raise_a_baby_that_came/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would all of them want you to raise the baby if Megan already has a new boyfriend?

They aren't YOUR friends.  They are HER friends.  They know she will leech off of them.  You are their out.  Nothing more.\n\nNTA to tell her to F off.", "NTA.\n\nNot your circus, not your monkeys. Leave now before you get caught up in something you don\u2019t want to be caught up in.", "Your \"friends\" are on another level. \n\nYour ex cheated and you ended the relationship. You're not trying to reconcile with her, you don't want to. And that doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nNTA", "Seems your friends and family are focusing on the \"ease and zero cost\" of making a baby this way instead of your original plan.  The end doesn't justify the means....she cheated on you flat out.  \n\nYou need to ask yourself why your friends and family are reacting so strongly... something isn't adding up here. Your partner cheated and is pregnant with his kid. 100 percent not your responsibility now or ever.\n\nNTA. Walk away fast and sure. And re evaluate your friendships.", "Absolutely million percent NTA.\n\nTheir using the fact that you're trans against you. \n\nIf this was a heteronormative relationship and she got pregnant by another guy, everyone would be screaming your innocence and never expect you to 'step up'.\n\nThat sounds like a Megan problem.\n\nThe concerns you've highlighted are very likely to happen, and she's now trying to manipulate and pressure you into being financially responsible for her affair child. She's showing you who she is, believe her. \n\nHope you find somebody that treats you with the respect you deserve.", "NTA\n\nYou need a new community.  Cheating transcends all orientations and it's awful that any of these \"friends\" think you should be subjected to any of this based on whatever misguided notions they have. She cheated, you have every right to walk away free and clear. Sounds like you might be the more stable one and people want you to pick up the tab, so to speak.\n\nWhat you do need is a better support system because the one you have is toxic. You deserve love, support,  and honesty. Not whatever these people are shilling. \n\nThis isn't your problem. Wash that manufactured guilt away and focus on healing from this event.", "NTA. She cheated on you. She and that friend now have to face the consequences of their actions. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", "Yeah\u2026.at the base level that I am taking this. Woman cheated, and wants the wealthy ex to fund her new life with the affair partner. That\u2026.is not reality. She chose who she wanted, and she needs to live within that life, which does not include you anymore. Especially since she doesn\u2019t want to include you as much as she wants to include your money. NTA stay as far away as you can.", "NTA. If you were a cis couple needing IVF and your partner cheated on you, that would also still be cheating. No two ways about it. Sounds like your mutuals don't have your best interests at heart. If they're so worried about the baby's welfare, and family is about more than DNA, why don't they step up - they've been more than happy to step up and point the finger.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a toy or a puppy to rehome. It\u2019s a baby, and not your baby.", "NTA. Sounds like these \"friends\" are volunteering to step up with their own time and resources to help raise this kid, right?", "NTA. Cheating is cheating. You have no relationship or responsibility to this child. You had nothing to do or say with the conception. The parents chose to have this child and have sole responsibility for it. No court is going to give you custody because you once planned to have a child with the mother. That has nothing to do with this child. I wish you well and you should feel no guilt at all.", "NTA. I'm actually baffled by this. This child is not your responsibility and I think its really weird that your friends think it is. \nDon't let someone elses fault set the course of your life.", "Woah so NTA. I suggest you might want to consider a new life with new friends because the ones you have suck almost as much as your cheating ex.", "NTA\n\nWTF??\n\nThe 'rules' are different for you?? Because your trans??\n\nNo one should expect anyone to raise another person's kid that was a result of them cheating on you.\n\nYou friends reasoning why it's ok for you to raise this kid is beyond belief.\n\nYou are totally NTA and there's some fucked up thinking in your friend group.\n\nI am so sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. You being trans has no bearing on your ex and your friend being shitbags. A silver lining is that she can\u2019t pass the child off as yours.", "NTA.... And RUN as far away as you can from these toxic people", "NTA. Your ex cheated. stay away from her and your friends , they are not your friends.", "NTA.\n\nSure you were ready to raise a child with woman, but that was before she cheated on you and you were no longer willing to stay with her. You have no obligation to her child she is having with another father. That's on him now.", "NTA. It is not your child and nobody should be expected to care for a baby that was created through cheating. They are not your friends and you did the right thing for you. There is no shame in that and stand your ground.", "NTA.\n\nYikes, your friends suck.  \n\nFirst, regarding your relationship with your ex: She cheated on you. That's justification for ending any relationship, full stop. Nothing about the plans for a pregnancy come into play in this step. You don't have any obligation to forgive her for that, the relationship is over and it's completely her fault.\n\nWith regards to the pregnancy, you are again fully justified in bowing out. There are two people involved in that pregnancy and you are not one of them.\n\nI would probably feel differently if she became pregnant according to plan then cheated - in that case you would have been part of the process and would have at least some degree of obligation to the future child. But that's not what happened.\n\nConsidering it seems like she went all-in with her affair partner, the biological father, you could easily be cut out 100%. The audacity of asking you to financially support any of this is insane.", "Wow, you have shitty friends. NTA", "There is no earthly reason you'd be granted custody of this child.", "It's not your kid. That is not your kid. That is not your kid. It doesn't matter if your ex-partner carried the kid. It doesn't matter if you were planning to have a child with the kid's parent. It's not your kid. You have no duty to this child. There is no reason that you should pursue parenthood of this child. \n\nYour friends' reasoning is actively insane to me.

Not your baby not your problem. Ex cheated on you which resulted in a baby, fuck everyone who is shaming you, go live your life.", "Do NOT adopt this baby and do NOT let people guilt you into this.  You are right to assume that you will have little rights to adopt a baby that is NOT yours biologically in which you were not even married to the mother.\n\nFurther, this will forever bind you to someone you are no longer in a romantic relationship and cannot trust.  You do not have feelings for this baby, and even should you cave to the pressures of people who are totally outside of this situation, you may find that you never bond with this baby.", "WTF did I just read? Where the hell are you from that friends and family think you are reaponsible for your ex's affair, baby? I think you need a whole new set of friends. Either your ex has all your friends and family in her pocket, or they are truly terrible people who don't give a shit about whats best for you. Dump the whole lot of them and find someone else. There are too many good people in this world who are looking for the same things you are for you to just accept someone elses problems.", "NTA\nHunny if that ain\u2019t your child you got no responsibility over them, tell her to get her baby daddy to raise em, because that ain\u2019t your job", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem.  Block them all and move on with your life", "NTA The point of taking a donor is to not have the biological parent in the picture (in principle) by making it someone who is very present and will likely assert their rights at some point, it completely changes the relationship.\n\nThey are seeing you as an ATM, dont let them.", "NTA. Especially given she's in a full blown relationship with the baby daddy. Sounds like things are not working out for her and baby expenses are beginning to stress her out and she trying to dump her responsibilities knowing the new guy might now be up for it. Don't fall for it", "NTA - Your ex wants you to step up and adopt the baby, yet she is still with they guy who is the father. It sounds like everyone wants you to step up and be the financial donor and support structure, but the bio dad is clearly in the picture which means you will never be the father, just the sponsor. \nIf she is still with the guy then this was not a one time slip, this is a relationship, so where do you fit in there? a spare wheel to their lives?\n\nshe chose this guy and continues to do so. This is not what you chose.", "NTA at all and anyone who says you are is the real AH. You absolutely did the right thing for yourself and there is no shame in that.

You have as much relationship to this baby as any of the friends and I bet none of them will step in here and why should you?", "NTA\n\nYour friends don\u2019t even make sense. Heartbreakingly you have zero claim to this baby. Your ex and her now boyfriend are the biological parents and are together. I\u2019m honestly confused as to why this is a question but I\u2019m a cis straight male. I can\u2019t imagine any scenario where friends would expect an ex cos straight boyfriend to be responsible for a baby that wasn\u2019t his and was the result of the affair that ended the relationship. I\u2019m sorry this sounds heartbreaking.", "NTA. That baby has a perfectly capable father. Just because your ex slept with a deadbeat, doesn't mean you have to step in. It's literally why you're exes.", "nta \n\nThe mutual friends making those comments are not your friends, they're her friends.", "NTA. What the hell. The mom IS with the father but you are the one that has to step up and be a parent? What kind of toxic fumes are these people inhaling? Where is the logic in that? \n\nTell your 'friends' to step up themselves. They have the same level of responsibility to that child as you. None. See how fast they shut up. Then drop them.", "NTA stop listening to your friends. 1- their opinion doesn't matter and 2- they are really wrong. This is not your baby and you aren't even in a relationship with Megan. What does this even have to do with you? You don't adopt and raise a baby because of peer pressure from your dumb friends.", "I hate when this happens to kids, but it's not yours and not your fault.  The baby has a father that needs to take responsibility, not you.  You are definitely NTA, I would walk away too.  Family is about more than DNA sometimes, but not in a case where your now ex got pregnant from somebody else.  To me the family ends when the cheating begins.", "lol, NTA. Let those two raise their natural child on their own. Anyone telling you to raise that random kid unrelated to you is the AH themselves.", "NTA. It's not your baby and you're not with the mother.", "I would get some better friends\u2026 NTA.", "Fuuuuucccckkkk that get the fuck out of there asap.\n\nYou were betrayed and have no more liability to your gf's baby than a random baby bron in the jungles of the Amazon or the desert's of Egypt.\n\nIf anyone tells you that your should raise the baby, your say \"listen, it's clear that you do not have my best interests at heart.

You have zero moral or legal standing to try to get custody and no court in the land would give it to you, whether you were trans or not.", "NTA\n\nShe's with the guy she cheated on you with. She's saying she wants you to raise their baby... While she, what? Lives with him?\n\nIt's not like the scenario is that she's left the guy she had the one night stand with, who knows about pregnancy and is certain he wants no involvement... If it was me I might be open to the idea of taking her back in that scenario, but certainly not in this one. \n\nI hope you know this isn't your only shot at becoming a parent OP. If you wanted to adopt a baby you could go to a country where the kids have no quality of life in an orphanage there and or even date a lady who happens to have a child and eventually marry her and possibly adopt the kid as well if all parties involved are happy to do that. Doing either of these things may even be better than using a sperm donor because at least you'd be helping an existing child rather than creating another one you wouldn't be biologically connected to anyway.", "These friends who have a lot of opinions about you stepping up and take care of the baby- not your friends. And you're NTA.", "NTA, you have no obligation here.", "I literally don\u2019t get it. She left your another partner and she is now pregnant with their child.

That is completely different from what was planned between the two of you. You would have never agreed to her sleeping with others, or being a father to a child from one of her flings.

We decided due to societal stigma, she would carry the baby. We picked out a sperm donor and decided to do a closed donation. \n\nA couple weeks before the procedure, she had sex with her best friend and became pregnant. \n\nI found out about the cheating. And let her know I couldn\u2019t be with her, that she should leave my house. I didn\u2019t get nasty about it. I just calmly stayed away that weekend and had friends watch my house while her new boyfriend helped her move her things. \n\nLater, mutuals let me know she became pregnant from the affair. That they think I should step up as the trans guy, cause I should know family is about more than just DNA, and raise this baby as my own, especially since I wanted a baby and I make far more than the guy who is the biological father. That I\u2019m more emotionally mature, etc etc. \n\nMy ex believes I should also step up and adopt the baby. \n\nCommunity has shamed me for not wanting to raise the baby. I wish the baby well, but I am not that baby\u2019s father. And the incompetence of the father should\u2019ve been thought about when the affair happened. \n\nFriends believe that what my ex did was okay. But I don\u2019t think so. I think she violated trust and went outside our agreements. I didn\u2019t consent to this baby. I consented to a baby born through the in-vitro process. \n\nFriends have said it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I should love the baby no matter what. That even my ex will be a somewhat terrible parent so it\u2019s responsibility to make sure this baby grows up in a healthy environment. It\u2019s not that I wish this baby ill, it\u2019s just that I worry every time I see this baby\u2014I\u2019ll think of the affair. I wish I could say I have it in me to forgive my ex for what happened\u2014but I think it will forever be something that comes up if I raise that baby. \n\nI also think that I would spend lots of money in attorney fees for custody when I have a little chance I\u2019d be granted custody. She is with the new guy she cheated on me with. Any court will see them as the legitimate parents of the baby. They will just see a trans person and it won\u2019t matter the stability I have\u2014they will give the baby to the cis, seemingly straight couple over a single, trans adult. \n\nAITA for not fighting for custody and raising this baby? It\u2019s been eating at me and the guilt is heavy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ignore EVERYONE who is making you feel bad about this. They seem to be completely ignoring the fact that your partner cheated on you to get pregnant. Yes, even if she had the IVF you wouldn't have been the baby's biological father but this situation is totally different. If everyone (you, her and the friend) agreed that this was a way for you two to have a child without IVF then fine, but you didn't. \n\nJust ask anyone who makes you feel bad if they would happily raise a kid that was the result of an affair, they wouldn't.", "Nta. Why would you still be expected to raise an affair baby with a woman you aren't with when the baby isn't even born yet? I'm just not following the logic here with your friends. You aren't together, she's not living with you. She's still currently pregnant so it's not like you and the baby bonded or anything. She literally fucked around and found out. She should have thought her decisions through a bit more. That's not your problem or responsibility anymore.", "NTA.\n\nMegan, the and the mutuals are real pieces of work. I\u2019d either tell the mutuals to mind their own fuckin business and ask them plainly \u201cif someone fucked your SO without your consent, got pregnant, and your SO decided to move in with the new person, would you raise their child?\u201d If they answer in the affirmative, then tell them to adopt and raise the child then. Seriously, they think they know what\u2019s best for the child, then they should step the fuck up and take care of it.\n\nYou are not responsible for anyone else\u2019s poor life decisions, so live your life as you see fit, and to hell with other people\u2019s opinions, it\u2019s YOUR life not theirs.", "NTA, tell all these \"friends\" if they are so concerned they should help with the baby.  She cheated on you with a bum.  Her poor choices her consequences.", "Ahhh, you know what this is about don't you? This is blinkered idiots who are looking at you and your ex as two people who wanted a baby and now she's got one, so you should raise it together because that's what you wanted. If you had been born a man and were sterile and your ex had an affair and got pregnant, they would not be pressuring you at all. \n\nNot sure if this falls into the category of transphobia but it smacks of crossing that line to me. \n\nYou are not that child's father, your ex made her bed, move on with your life and become a dad with someone who respects you.", "NTA. Why are your friends with stupid people?", "NTA and you need new friends. They are staying on the side of someone that cheated on you, and now they and the cheater want you to raise an affair baby. You have no obligations to this child, your ex and your friends.  \n\n\nNTA and you need new friends.

In no way should you be involved with that baby and woman. I\u2019d be telling them all to fuck right off.", "I think this is some weird anti-trans/enby sheit here, because a cis-man would **absolutely not** be expected to have anything to do with an affair baby. \n\nWhat the heck is wrong with your friends for thinking that? It seems like they\u2019re not really thinking if you as a person with your own thoughts and feelings. \n\nNTA.", "You are not the father. Period.\n\nShe is with the father.  Period.\n\nShe is the mother.  Period.\n\nYou were not married to the mother at the time of the conception.  Period.\n\nYou are not the father.  Period.\n\nRepeat.  Rinse.  Repeat.\n\nYou will not get custody of that baby for the reasons listed above unless there is abuse or neglect.  No court in the world would give you custody or require support payments just because you are in a better financial position than the biological parents. \n\nYou need better friends.  This mentality of \"you wanted a baby and any baby should do!\" is crazy.  You need to ask these nut jobs if the ends justify the means, do they intend that you should go and steal a baby, anyone's baby, just because you want a child and they happen to have one?  \n\nRepeat.  You need better friends.  Drop these morons.  Block your ex.  Move if you must to avoid your ex leaving her child on your doorstep.  \n\nYou do know at some point, your ex will be back, even if you adopt her spawn, right?  She will want a relationship with her child.  She will want to move in.  She will want money.  This situation has \"disaster\" written all over it!\n\nRead the stars my dude.  She was not \"the one\" for you at this time.  This baby is not a \"gift from above\" meant for you.  This situation is not a blessing in disguise for you in any way, shape or form.  Go find someone else who deserves your love and loyalty, and make a family with that person.  Not with someone who cheated on you and expects you to clean up her mess because you can afford to.\n\nNta", "She CHEATED on you! Period.\n\nNTA. For not wanting her anywhere near you anymore. And that includes the results of the cheating.", "Nta. That\u2019s not your child.", "NTA. I could never. You need a new circle of friends", "Nta. Ignore these friends. Why does everyone writing on reddit have such shitty friends?", "They just want your money. Your ex wants you to support not only the child but also her. She wants you to do the work for a child that isn't yours. Tell all those assholes that they can pitch in and raise the baby. And what's to stop your ex from having another child with that guy and demanding you raise that one too? NTA", "NTA! Honestly I can\u2019t believe your friends. She cheated on you and she\u2019s still with this guy. The sheer audacity to ask YOU to step up! I\u2019m speechless. \n\nLook, fuck the community for shaming you - they obviously don\u2019t know the full story. Fuck your friends for not supporting you - you need better friends than that. And fuck your ex and her \u2018special friend\u2019 in particular for being a pair of rancid AHs. \n\nLet go of the guilt - you have zero responsibility for or connection with that baby. Don\u2019t let them take advantage of you, OP. You deserve so much better than that.", "NTA You need new friends. Your partner betrayed you. Your partner is already in a new relationship. The baby is theirs. You weren't even married that you can use this for custody. You are not the parent. They behave so high and mighty as if they can decide who can - no must -  raise the child. \n\nI wonder if it is just more comfortable for your friends if you and your ex are together again, like no decision on which side. So know they try to force you selfishly to forgive her and raise the child. They don't think about what is best for you or the child, no, what is best for them.", "NTA \n\nThose people around you don\u2019t sound like your friends Op! \n\nYour ex cheated on you. End of story. You are allowed your feelings of betrayal and to put distance between you and her. \n\nHow are you supposed to raise this baby and love it when you can\u2019t be with your ex fully? You don\u2019t trust her. \n\nI hope you can process your feelings, move on and even move away. You need a new friend circle that supports you. You are worth it! \n\nShe and her new partner can raise the baby. They all just want to use you. \n\nGood luck Op!", "NTA, tell said friends to step up as they seem to think it's the right thing. Your ex just wants child support. I can't see bio daddy being too enthusiastic about visitation.", "Info- what the fuck?! \n\nSeriously though, I have exes that have had children since my relationship with them. I have nothing to do with their children. Because why the hell would I? Your ex got pregnant. Why would the baby have anything to do with you? What\u2019s the supposed connection here? I just can\u2019t see the logic here at all.", "What asylum did this craziness happen at? More mental illness in this story than a Reagan Era sanitarium", "They will  \"give\" the child to the parents and that isn't you. Had the baby been conceived with donor sperm then you would be the parent and not the other man but this isn't how it happened. Moreover you don't want this child and no one should be judging you for that.  \n\nNone of this is your responsibility. Your ex is having a child with her new partner and you are entitled to move on. NTA.", "So she cheats on you and wants to have you raise her affair kid. Are you sure this is the only time she cheated on you. It sounds like she was going to try and pass off the baby as the one from IVF. The difference is that you wanted to have a family without the betrayal and infidelity and it\u2019s wrong for everyone to try and same your for it because the initial child wouldn\u2019t be blood related to you. Basically they\u2019re telling you to put up and shut up and that\u2019s wrong. NTA", "Nta. She cheated on you! This isn\u2019t a trans issue, it\u2019s a your partner was terrible and now her problems are no longer your problems issue.", "This has to be fake i'm sorry. \"Friends\" think that after she cheats with someone else, and gets pregnant, you have a responsibility to raise it? \n\nI refuse to believe i, and therefore YTA for lying in the post.", "This.  What the hell is going on here.", "I think this story was just made up.", "I agree. This sounds more like a thought experiment than something happening in real life, doesn\u2019t it?", "Better yet, tell everyone telling OP since they see nothing wrong with her actions they can step up and provide for the child. Good grief!", "Seriously wth? Just because op originally wanted a baby through in vitro does not mean this is their baby. Not at all.\n\nIf it were a male trying to have a baby with a gf who cheated and got pregnant with someone else, this wouldn't even be in question. This is clearly sigma and ignorance preceding logic.\n\nNTA at all.", "And get away from the \"friends\" that have a lot of opinions and not much sense.", "So much of this! You put into words every thought running through my mind while reading this post. NTA.", "I don\u2019t find it hard at all.

She's still with the guy who got her pregnant? They just want you to support them. It's ridiculous. NTA", " They know she will leech off of them. You are their out.", "No one would be trying if they were cis lesbians either", "I have found myself taking breaks from this sub for my mental well-being because it baffles me how inhumane some people can be. I feel so bad for OP", "Read their post history. You are on the money. OP is also a 45M, 26M and a single mom", "Yeah. I highly doubt her friends are that much off their heads.", "Their account was created today and this is the only post. Were you looking at a different profile or something?", "There is no post history", "It felt weird even before I got to the bit about the two biological parents being in a relationship with each other, but then, no. The \u201ccommunity\u201d wants OP to basically try to steal a couple\u2019s baby because one member of it once planned a baby with OP? That\u2026is surprising."]}
