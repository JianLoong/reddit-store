It's something he got from my grandfather. He loves calling people over and hosting small get-togethers, and it's happened enough for me to get used to it. What bothers me, though, is that he expects me and my sister (19F) to bend over backwards for him and his friends. Examples include designing our rooms specifically to use them as guest rooms and berating me for not wanting to switch places with a guest at the dinner table.\n\nHe wants me and my sister at these occasions, but never actually interacts with us. He's never had any respect for our time, boundaries or work. Complaining or refusing to attend usually caused fights.\n\nI moved in with my fianc\u00e9 (25M) after college. Our first son was born last month. My dad has been trying to convince us to come over for a party with his friends for a while. We've refused, mostly because our baby's first month has been exhausting.\n\nYesterday, he invited us over to his apartment for dinner. This time, he promised something simple: burgers, bonding with the baby and a movie. I was looking forward to spending time with my dad, so we agreed to come.\n\nWhen we got there to see the promised burgers\u2026 surrounded by about a dozen of my dad's friends. It was very obviously a \"Meet My Grandson\" dinner party. His drunk-ish friends were all around, gushing and asking to hold my son. There was loud music playing, and my baby started crying moments after we got there. I didn't even see my father for a while.\n\nThe final straw, though, was when my dad led us to where he wanted us to sit: at a coffee table in front of the TV. He'd moved stuff around to accommodate two placemats for me and my fianc\u00e9. It's not even tall enough for chairs. The actual dinner table was fully occupied by his friends, and he didn't want to make his guests sit on the floor. He claimed to be hosting the dinner for us, but didn't even want us to sit at the table.\n\nI told my dad we had to go home. He tried to convince us to stay, but we left only 15 minutes after arriving.\n\nOn the way home, my father called me furious, going on about how excited his friends had been to meet the baby, and how me and my fianc\u00e9 are robbing him of spending time with his grandson. I told him I wasn't going to sit on the floor with my baby just so he could chat with his friends, and that we were too tired and overwhelmed to deal with a dinner party. I explained that the only reason we even came was because he promised it was just a movie night, not a party with his friends. He got annoyed and said that what mattered was spending time together, and didn't listen when I argued that he didn't even expect us to be near him.\n\nMy mom is on my side (they've been divorced since I was 7, and she's always hated that behavior), but my sister is on my dad's. She says that he just wanted to spend time with us and introduce his first grandchild to his friends, and that we could have sucked it up for a night.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: he didn't inform us there would be guests. The only other person I expected to see there was his current girlfriend, and I was okay with that. We had no reason to believe anyone else would be there. The other guests were mostly couples, plus one or two of his single friends.

What he cares about is having trophies to show off and feel good about. Your sister is what one might call an enabler. She's been so beaten down by your dad, she's forgotten she's her own person allowed to have her own boundaries. Good on you for remembering that for yourself.", "NTA. Your dad doesn't want family, he wants attention. He will always put his family last. There is no reason for \"guests come first\" unless said guest is someone important (president of the company and you don't want to lose your job type of important) but otherwise, family is always first. Now I can understand a \"kids table\" during bigger dinner parties whee there isn't enough room at the main table, but if you are supposed to be the \"guest of honor\" (i.e. the reason the event is happening in the first place) then you are now THE most important person there and should have pride of place at the main table. My recommendation is that you put extreme boundaries into place and hold to them. Don't go to his place unless you KNOW there aren't any friends or anyone whom he considers a \"guest\" (since clearly family aren't guests, even if they don't live with him which technically makes them \\*gasp\\* guests!). Otherwise you get to see him only if he is at an event where he can't control the placement of guests (your home, your sister's place, another family event, etc.). Let the entire family know that you are tired of being viewed and treated like you are a servant/slave (don't be afraid to use the term slave in this situation) whom isn't ever supposed to be seen by anyone visiting the home and if you show up to a \"family\" dinner or any other family type of event where you are a GUEST and are treated as is normal for him, you will immediately turn around and leave because you will not entertain that disrespect to you or your husband and children. As for your sister, remind her that the child is yours, only one month old, and YOU (and your husband) are the one who dictates who gets to meet your son not anyone else. If your dad really wants to meet and bond with his grandson, then the extra people didn't need to be there. If she wants to enable and encourage his behavior, she is welcome to have children then be paraded around like the shiny baubles that then get shoved aside mere minutes into the gathering.", "NTA\n\nGet a better dad.", "Dad is totally the A**", "NTA ish but also INFO\nSounds like your dad has a different idea of what spending time with family means than you do. Have you tried setting clear boundaries with your dad studying your expectations? \"We are only coming over if it is just us and you, we are too tired to expend energy on anyone else but family right now, so if there is a dinner party we will not be attending for the foreseeable future?\" \nYou said that refusing to attend or complaining causes arguments, but sometimes that is simply the nature of setting boundaries, but I'm not sure if you have just stated your case and stuck to it. Your dad simply might not be aware that this behavior is hurting you, as asinine as it sounds, and he might be under the false assumption that you enjoy it because you keep doing it, and even more so that you will keep doing it because you keep doing it. \n\nIf you clearly communicated to your dad your expectations and he violated them NTA, but if you didn't then maybe we ESH, because while you don't have to put up with anything you don't want to, exiting in that way is a chaotic way of handling conflict for all of you. Fights or no fights, sometimes we have to state our boundaries and deal with people trying to push them, argue with us, and just generally try to push us back into a square hole, and we can't give in if we know that it's right for us. \n\nSounds like a very tough situation, I commend you for putting your foot down when you felt that enough was enough!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Bonding time would have been the 4 of them hanging out, chatting or watching a movie while dad held his grandson. Loud music and dad's drunken friends trying to play pass the dutchie with the baby had no part of that.\n\nAbout the only part of what dad said it would be that wan't a lie was the promise of burgers.

Well, if you don't tell someone exactly what you expect or the consequence is that you will be leaving after fifteen minutes, then they don't know that. \n\nThey might know other things, like that you are not getting what you wanted, but they don't know what the expectations and consequences are.Dad can now deal with those consequences, but he will never know the expectations and understand the link to consequences if they are not directly communicated to him. And probably repeated boundaries and consequences, because that's how people learn.  \n\nIs it ridiculous that he doesn't understand how tiring and awful it would be to be put in OP's shoes? To you, maybe. But everyone grows up with different values. OPs dad grew up with dinner party = quality time values, and so that is what he knows. It's not right or wrong, it just is. \n\nPutting op at the coffee table might have been a hugely dumb move by dad, but we actually don't know why he did that. Maybe he thought that she wanted to sit on the ground with the newborn. Idk.  \n\nIf OP has been clearly reiterating and enforcing boundaries with dad for a long time, ops dad straight lied to op about the event, and then this happened, then yes, 100% dad is TA. \n\nBut if OP has not been doing that and walked into a familiar situation expecting things to be different without clearly stating that, then the a**holery has been spread a bit."]}
