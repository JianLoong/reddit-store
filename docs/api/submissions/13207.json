What he cares about is having trophies to show off and feel good about. Your sister is what one might call an enabler. She's been so beaten down by your dad, she's forgotten she's her own person allowed to have her own boundaries. Good on you for remembering that for yourself.", "NTA. Your dad doesn't want family, he wants attention. He will always put his family last. There is no reason for \"guests come first\" unless said guest is someone important (president of the company and you don't want to lose your job type of important) but otherwise, family is always first. Now I can understand a \"kids table\" during bigger dinner parties whee there isn't enough room at the main table, but if you are supposed to be the \"guest of honor\" (i.e. the reason the event is happening in the first place) then you are now THE most important person there and should have pride of place at the main table. My recommendation is that you put extreme boundaries into place and hold to them. Don't go to his place unless you KNOW there aren't any friends or anyone whom he considers a \"guest\" (since clearly family aren't guests, even if they don't live with him which technically makes them \\*gasp\\* guests!). Otherwise you get to see him only if he is at an event where he can't control the placement of guests (your home, your sister's place, another family event, etc.). Let the entire family know that you are tired of being viewed and treated like you are a servant/slave (don't be afraid to use the term slave in this situation) whom isn't ever supposed to be seen by anyone visiting the home and if you show up to a \"family\" dinner or any other family type of event where you are a GUEST and are treated as is normal for him, you will immediately turn around and leave because you will not entertain that disrespect to you or your husband and children. As for your sister, remind her that the child is yours, only one month old, and YOU (and your husband) are the one who dictates who gets to meet your son not anyone else. If your dad really wants to meet and bond with his grandson, then the extra people didn't need to be there. If she wants to enable and encourage his behavior, she is welcome to have children then be paraded around like the shiny baubles that then get shoved aside mere minutes into the gathering.", "NTA\n\nGet a better dad.", "Dad is totally the A**", "NTA ish but also INFO\nSounds like your dad has a different idea of what spending time with family means than you do. Have you tried setting clear boundaries with your dad studying your expectations? \"We are only coming over if it is just us and you, we are too tired to expend energy on anyone else but family right now, so if there is a dinner party we will not be attending for the foreseeable future?\" \nYou said that refusing to attend or complaining causes arguments, but sometimes that is simply the nature of setting boundaries, but I'm not sure if you have just stated your case and stuck to it. Your dad simply might not be aware that this behavior is hurting you, as asinine as it sounds, and he might be under the false assumption that you enjoy it because you keep doing it, and even more so that you will keep doing it because you keep doing it. \n\nIf you clearly communicated to your dad your expectations and he violated them NTA, but if you didn't then maybe we ESH, because while you don't have to put up with anything you don't want to, exiting in that way is a chaotic way of handling conflict for all of you. Fights or no fights, sometimes we have to state our boundaries and deal with people trying to push them, argue with us, and just generally try to push us back into a square hole, and we can't give in if we know that it's right for us. \n\nSounds like a very tough situation, I commend you for putting your foot down when you felt that enough was enough!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re Dad didn\u2019t want to spend time with you and the baby, he wanted to show off the baby to his friends. In your time there you barley interacted with him because of his other guests. \nAnyone whose had a newborn understands that the new parents are exhausted and likely don\u2019t want to attend unnecessary parties. Add to that that Covid is still a thing and we are still in cold and flu season. Do you know what is more difficult than a newborn? A sick newborn because his grandparent had to trick the parents into a party so gramps could show off.", "NTA. Your father is an ass, and your sister is enabling his bullshit by being an apologist for it. Let them be mad. Their expectations completely suck.", "NTA - I would have cracked at the same time as you did - with the floor seats.    Our family would always get extra folding tables and chairs.   There's no excuse to make you sit on the floor.    For Pete's sake!", "NTA. Your father is the AH.", "NTA your sister and father say it was to spend time with the baby but are they not realizing he had you *away* from the people like? Cognitive dissonance is wild", "Regardless of being the guests of honour, you should have a proper seat simply because you gave birth a month ago. People rarely talk about the post partum problems, but you\u2019re still healing and sitting on the floor is likely very uncomfortable for you. \n\nBabies should also still be in a type of quarantine at this age as they\u2019re too young to have vaccinations and they\u2019re more susceptible to a lot of potentially fatal illnesses. \n\nNTA at all (and that doesn\u2019t even get into the deception and disrespect).", "[removed]", "u/Origindsf is a comment stealing bot that literally copied the same comment it's replying to.", "My sperm donor was the exact same way. My time at his house considerate of me taking care of myself, at 6, so he could ignore me for tv, friends, his girlfriend and a damn bird. He actually talked to the bird more than anyone. I was so glad he disappeared when my mom took him for more child support. Your very much NTA. That behavior/treatment is absolutely maddening and you'll feel better if you step back for a few. Not forever maybe, but at least until your kid has an established schedule and you've been sleeping through the night for a while. I'm sorry your dad has his head up his ass, hopefully the smell gets to him soon.", "Baby is a prop...grandfather is despicable....only thingbyou fid wrong was listening to him in the first place. \n\nNTA", "Girl your baby isn\u2019t even old enough for all their needles and your dad has all his mates around? Other than simply being a trophy, what does he value in the relationship he has with you and your family?", "But that was my question, did he lie to her? It's not clear in the post if he specifically said, \"there will be no one else but us there\" or not. \n\nThat's why I asked for INFO. \n\nAnd my point about boundaries is that if you don't communicate them clearly and then stick to them, but you keep doing the same thing over and over with the person, it creates chaos. Does the dad suck? Sure. \n\nDoes OP know from past experiences what dad is likely to do in this situation? Yes. \n\nTo me, if the boundary was clearly communicated, even after the fact, that OP and immediate family of OP are the only people that OP will be spending time with at dads place or they will be leaving, then yes, dad is TA. \n\nIf it wasn't clear then a) the dad is actually doing exactly what he always does and everyone around him knows him to do and b) OP bears some responsibility to clearly set boundaries and act on them. Otherwise this situation is highly predicable and a waste of everyone's time.", "Why do you care what your sister says? You have to know dad's behavior is messed up"]}
