Omg I would\u2019ve been out of there after 10.", "NTA. She acted incredibly self-centered and you can bet if you did the same to her she would have be pissed and probably would have left you there. Don\u2019t consider for one moment that you\u2019re an A/H\u2026", "NTA  Your 'friend' was being incredibly rude.  She could have quickly answered her call and told the caller she would ring back later.", ">We didn\u2019t speak for a couple of days but she then called me to tell me that her friend on the phone was feeling down and that\u2019s why she took the call to help cheer them up, and she felt she couldn\u2019t hang up.\n\nNTA. That explanation came a few days too late.\n\nWhen I'm with a friend and  one of them takes a personal call, which happens quite often, they always tell me why they have to answer it.\n\nI guess your friend tried at the time.", "NTA. Friend should've let you know that she needed to focus on the call (didn't even need to say why, just that it's very important and she doesn't know how long it may take) so that you could either choose to wait or leave at some point. If you then had chosen to wait 60min, that would be on you. But that wasn't the case here.\n\nHer being miffed that you told her you're leaving is just her not wanting the guilt of being the one at fault. The fact is, she was at fault for making you wait for so long instead of telling you that you can leave.\n\nEdit to clarify: I meant that friend should've noted after about 10 or so minutes into the call that you were waiting and took a moment to let you know that the call was important and that it may take a long time.", "NTA.  She was definitely is.  Taking a personal call while in a public space like a bar is already an AH move.  Doing so for a very long time while hanging out with someone else is completely awful.", "NTA.    Sorry, everyone feels down sometimes.  Friend should have told she would  call her back.\n\nYou waited an hour???  I'd  be out after 10 min", "Yeah..after 10min, i would have reminded her I'm there.  After 20, I would have said that it seems the call is very important and your leaving", "NTA, your friend should have told her friend she would call her back when she was free, not like just because she's feeling down they have to speak on the phone at that exact moment.", "NTA", "NTA- your friend needs to learn how to set healthy boundaries with her friends one of which would be to tell that calller \u201cI will call you as soon as I get home but I can\u2019t talk right this minute.\u201d  and then go back to the table and spend the time that she invited you to spend with her with you.  You definitely should\u2019ve left because whatever reason is it doesn\u2019t make it OK for her to abandon you when she invited you out like that. It just does not. Hopefully she\u2019s learned a lesson now, but you were right to leave and she was wrong to leave you sitting there like that. Whatever the reason was, she could\u2019ve said I\u2019m so sorry this emergency has happened or if it\u2019s not an emergency like I said, hang up the phone until she gets home. You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA. She invited you, then ignored you. She was incredibly rude.

Letting people hang while you take a phone call is not just bad manners: it's treating others as if they don't exist.\n\nAs for the friend who was \"feeling down,\" is that a reason to behave this way?

Carrying on a long phone conversation is highly annoying to everyone else around them as well.", "Exactly.  I've had phone calls where I felt I couldn't hang up (thankfully at home), but at least she could have done some kind of sign language to OP to indicate she was sorry, was stuck, and what did OP want to do?", "well, you need to stop that and think of yourself more. 60 minutes is way too long of a time to spend on the phone when you're supposed to be with someone else. extremely disrespectful of this \"friend\".", "I can be a people pleaser to my detriment as well. Think of it this way: your friend is claiming she took the call to cheer up someone who was \"feeling down\". Did she not think that ignoring someone she was supposed to catching up with wouldn't make _them_ feel down? What is the point of making one person feel better at the cost of directly being the cause of making another friend feel like shit? Why did your friend not pause the call long enough to explain what was happening and reschedule with you instead of leaving you trapped for an indefinite amount of time listening to half of a boring conversation?\n\nThe answer is your friend sucks and her excuse doesn't make sense. If the friend on the other line was feeling _that_ down, you would have been hearing phrases about cheering up. Not regular conversation. The truth is that your friend was happy to hang out with you until something better came along and that was a phone call with someone else. She didn't tell you what was going on when you left because it wasn't going on. She was just straight up ignoring you for someone she preferred and only gave you an excuse later to keep you \"open\" as an option in case her preferred people were busy or because you have some asset she still wants access to.\n\nI would think twice about putting any more time into this friendship.
