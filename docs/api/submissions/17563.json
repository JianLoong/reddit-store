Omg I would\u2019ve been out of there after 10.", "NTA. She acted incredibly self-centered and you can bet if you did the same to her she would have be pissed and probably would have left you there. Don\u2019t consider for one moment that you\u2019re an A/H\u2026", "NTA  Your 'friend' was being incredibly rude.  She could have quickly answered her call and told the caller she would ring back later.", ">We didn\u2019t speak for a couple of days but she then called me to tell me that her friend on the phone was feeling down and that\u2019s why she took the call to help cheer them up, and she felt she couldn\u2019t hang up.\n\nNTA. That explanation came a few days too late.\n\nWhen I'm with a friend and  one of them takes a personal call, which happens quite often, they always tell me why they have to answer it.\n\nI guess your friend tried at the time.", "NTA. Friend should've let you know that she needed to focus on the call (didn't even need to say why, just that it's very important and she doesn't know how long it may take) so that you could either choose to wait or leave at some point. If you then had chosen to wait 60min, that would be on you. But that wasn't the case here.\n\nHer being miffed that you told her you're leaving is just her not wanting the guilt of being the one at fault. The fact is, she was at fault for making you wait for so long instead of telling you that you can leave.\n\nEdit to clarify: I meant that friend should've noted after about 10 or so minutes into the call that you were waiting and took a moment to let you know that the call was important and that it may take a long time.", "NTA.  She was definitely is.  Taking a personal call while in a public space like a bar is already an AH move.  Doing so for a very long time while hanging out with someone else is completely awful.", "NTA.    Sorry, everyone feels down sometimes.  Friend should have told she would  call her back.\n\nYou waited an hour???  I'd  be out after 10 min", "Yeah..after 10min, i would have reminded her I'm there.  After 20, I would have said that it seems the call is very important and your leaving", "NTA, your friend should have told her friend she would call her back when she was free, not like just because she's feeling down they have to speak on the phone at that exact moment.", "NTA", "NTA- your friend needs to learn how to set healthy boundaries with her friends one of which would be to tell that calller \u201cI will call you as soon as I get home but I can\u2019t talk right this minute.\u201d  and then go back to the table and spend the time that she invited you to spend with her with you.  You definitely should\u2019ve left because whatever reason is it doesn\u2019t make it OK for her to abandon you when she invited you out like that. It just does not. Hopefully she\u2019s learned a lesson now, but you were right to leave and she was wrong to leave you sitting there like that. Whatever the reason was, she could\u2019ve said I\u2019m so sorry this emergency has happened or if it\u2019s not an emergency like I said, hang up the phone until she gets home. You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA. She invited you, then ignored you. She was incredibly rude.

No sense wasting your entire evening on a shitty 'friend'.", "60 minutes? Did you tell her you feel down too after being ignored for an hour? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend treated you abominably. Letting people hang while you take a phone call is not just bad manners: it's treating others as if they don't exist.\n\nAs for the friend who was \"feeling down,\" is that a reason to behave this way?

Carrying on a long phone conversation is highly annoying to everyone else around them as well.", "Exactly.  I've had phone calls where I felt I couldn't hang up (thankfully at home), but at least she could have done some kind of sign language to OP to indicate she was sorry, was stuck, and what did OP want to do?", "well, you need to stop that and think of yourself more. 60 minutes is way too long of a time to spend on the phone when you're supposed to be with someone else. extremely disrespectful of this \"friend\".", "I can be a people pleaser to my detriment as well. Think of it this way: your friend is claiming she took the call to cheer up someone who was \"feeling down\". Did she not think that ignoring someone she was supposed to catching up with wouldn't make _them_ feel down? What is the point of making one person feel better at the cost of directly being the cause of making another friend feel like shit? Why did your friend not pause the call long enough to explain what was happening and reschedule with you instead of leaving you trapped for an indefinite amount of time listening to half of a boring conversation?\n\nThe answer is your friend sucks and her excuse doesn't make sense. If the friend on the other line was feeling _that_ down, you would have been hearing phrases about cheering up. Not regular conversation. The truth is that your friend was happy to hang out with you until something better came along and that was a phone call with someone else. She didn't tell you what was going on when you left because it wasn't going on. She was just straight up ignoring you for someone she preferred and only gave you an excuse later to keep you \"open\" as an option in case her preferred people were busy or because you have some asset she still wants access to.\n\nI would think twice about putting any more time into this friendship. NTA", "NTA... Emergency calls are one thing, she basically left for an hour. Leaving was the only dignified thing to do.", "NTA she left you long before you left her.", "NTA \n\nShe was rude and should have declined the call.", "NTA- She could have made arrangements to call at a different time to cheer the friend up.  Or she could have paused the call and asked you if it was all right if she took the call or that she had to take the call.\n\nCommunication", "NTA, except for the fact that you waited an hour.  Should have indicated after about five minutes that if she was too busy to be present, you'd take your leave.", "NTA\n\nShe could've told her friend to wait a minute, apologized to you and told you what was happening, or told her friend that she'd call as soon as she got home, but instead she hung you out to dry for 60 MINUTES!! Do NOT feel guilty.", "NTA - After 10 minutes you should walk over and nicely tell her you need to re-schedule.  I can't believe you waited 60 minutes to leave.  It is nice that your friend explained, but that is insane.  I think it is rude even to answer a phone while you are in a conversation with someone else.  The person you are in front of is more important than someone who is randomly calling you on the phone.  Of course, there are emergency exceptions, but they are really rare and you just say, sorry, I have an emergency that I need to deal with.", "NTA. Not to sound harsh, but you're the \"side friend\" - there when she needs you. But not when you need her.", "Wtf! No NTA, she literally could have not taken the call, explained to you her friend needed someone and called her back, or answered and asked her to hold on a minute to wrap things up with you. That\u2019s rude af what she did.", "NTA\n\nIt's an asshole move of her to leave you sitting there but if her friend on the phone was having a serious issue or depression I can understand her feeling obligated to stay on the line to cheer her up, for example I know people who are like the person someone calls when feeling suicidal and it can be hard for them to juggle social responsibilities.\n\nOn the flipside, she did leave you sitting there for an hour and you could hear her talking just general chit chat which... not cool, if she knew the call was going to go on a long time she should have stopped it for a minute to go in and tell you what was happening/that she would be a while rather than just leave you sitting there. She also could've apologised for what happened the next day as well as offering the explanation she did.", "NTA - If that was the case, she should have told you.", "My go-to is to pretend I'm in the conversation haha. Answering questions and responding like I'm the one they are talking to. It really annoys people. They give you that look because they won't talk over the person on the other end of the line. It's pretty great.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Your friend was very rude to you. If she triages that the person \"feeling down\" is always going to be more important than her guest, that the person suddenly demanding her attention with a random phone call is entitled to waste an hour of her guest's time, then maybe don't accept her invitations anymore.", ">friend on the phone was feeling down\n\nShe could have told you that at the moment and reschedule the meeting instead of wasting your time\n\nNTA\n\n60 min is rude af.", "Or if it was really an emergency that couldn\u2019t be delayed even an hour (it probably wasn\u2019t) profusely apologised to OP, left money to cover her drink and gone outside. It\u2019d still be hurtful but not downright rude in the same way as carrying on a long conversation right there.", ">She was just straight up ignoring you for someone she preferred and only gave you an excuse later to keep you \"open\" as an option in case her preferred people were busy or because you have some asset she still wants access to.\n\nAbsolutely agree, this definitely sounds like the 'friend' is a social butterfly/vampire and OP is on the b or c list of 'friends'. NTA OP, you should hold zero guilt about leaving. You were being socially abused do to neglect. Personally, I would have rather spent that hour at home reading webnovels.\n\nAlthough personally, my mid-20's, pre smart phone, I probably would have dug a book out of my jacket or car(I was more likely to be without cigarettes than be without a fantasy novel) and read in a bar corner while drinking, or used the time becoming best friends with the bar staff... I spent most of my free time in bars in my 20's and when not hanging out with coworkers was well known for either chilling out alone or having very long pop culture or job related conversations with bar staff and other 'after work' regulars. Bar cooks can be very interesting people.", "NTA. If your 'friend' really DID have to soothe someone on the phone and gave a shit about the way she treated you she'd have called you to apologize profusely as soon as she could get off the phone and not call days later to fob you off with a transparent afterthought of an excuse.", "NTA\n\nMy husband is always talking phone calls While we\u2019re traveling, talking, etc. I\u2019ve found the best way to make my point that he spends too long one the phone is to call him on his cell while he is talking on it.", "NTA.\n\nIf it was important - e.g. she was basically trying to talk her depressed friend off a ledge - she should have come back in and let you know so the two of you could figure out what to do about the get-together.", "If she isn't lying, she should have communicated that and called it a day.", "And I either read that wrong or op also paid the bill..."]}
