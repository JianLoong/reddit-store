You just need to avoid further contact regarding her and your acne issues, and go see a licensed dermatologist to deal with it because it's only making it worse and could leave to permanent scarring with what she's doing.  If she refuses and tries to guilt you, then it's time you go your separate ways because then she's risking your health for her own selfish needs.", "NTA.Your limits with your body are yours alone. And if your gf doesn't like it, she's not worth having", "NTA. I know as a girlfriend it can be tempting to want to pick at my bf's face lol but ultimately it is 100% his decision. She is petty for this and toxic. Such a stupid argument. Not to mention you are allowed to revoke your consent at any given time, regardless of some promise you made. Also the fact that she threatened physical violence on you??? Red flag.", "NTA. Tell her you didn't know it would get overwhelming when you agreed before. This is like any form of consent - you're allowed to change your mind and withdraw consent. And raising her fist is concerning, too.", "NTA. You set your boundaries for physical consent and she needs to respect them.", "NTA\n\nShe has no right to do this to you. It's your body. You get to decide. Also, what she is doing will not improve your acne situation. It causes scarring. It slows healing. It can lead to infections and additional breakouts. \n\nGo to a dermatologist for skin care. \n\nYour GF is letting her desire get in the way of your bodily autonomy and comfort.", "NTA. Promise or not, this is abnormal and 100% a *her* problem. This is a weird sort of promise anyhow - she doesn\u2019t like how you physically feel and she gets angry if you don\u2019t allow her to manipulate your skin to her liking?", "NTA, your girlfriend is pushing your boundaries and any promises you make and consent you give can be revoked if you feel uncomfortable. Like you say, it is your skin and your girlfriend doesn\u2019t seem to be respecting that", "NTA. My boyfriend has let me pop his pimples a few times but it hurt him and he said he doesn't want me to do it any more so I don't.

NTA and all of this is bizarre... like I'm tempted to say chat got levels of bizarre. \n\nObviously you get to say no. You get to say 'ow and now we're done... how does overeating have anything to do with any of this? And how do we get from you're overreacting to now I'm goin from punch you and make a move like I'm going to do so... \n\nThan we're at a bar. No. Hinky.", "This can\u2019t be a real scenario. \n\nIf it is, YTA but probably not for breaking your promise. See a dermatologist already.

That she was haranguing you enough that you felt you needed to make the promise is not a good look for her.\n\n100%, it's your body, your skin, your choice. She gets no say on the matter, no not even if she's your partner she doesn't get any say.\n\nThat said, this problem transcended just physical autonomy when your girlfriend threatened to hit you and shouted at you for not letting her pop your pimples. Your girlfriend went from boundary stomping to straight up abusive in a single motion of her arm, even if she didn't hit you, because she still threatened to do so.\n\nI don't think this is a good relationship OP, and it's not your fault.\n\nNTA", "NTA OP \n\nYour body is nobody\u2019s body but yours", "There is something significantly wrong with your gf.  I hope she's actually your ex-gf, but you haven't said anything about that yet.  \n\nIf you don't want  her to pop your pimples, she needs to not pop them.  It's your body.  Not hers.  She needs to respect your wishes about this. I take it you promised to let her pop them to get her to stop fighting with you... but this just means that she's also abusive and coercive. \n\nAnd she raised her fist towards your face. So, she threatens violence if you don't let her pop your pimples. On YOUR body.  Something is wrong with her. You can do better. NTA.\n\nBreak up and find a better gf.", "I'm going to puke. But first, go see a dermatologist and tell your freaky friend to go get some bubble wrap if she's addicted to popping stuff. ESH.", "NTA. If she wants to pop pimples everyday, tell her to go be a dermatologist. It hurts, my husband had back acne too. Just get a acne body wash, something with salicylic acid is good. Just tell her, she can do it only if you ask. It\u2019s your body", "If your girlfriend is threatening physical violence over PIMPLE POPPING then you need to take a step back and really think if you want to be in a relationship like that. This feels like a sign that it will eventually escalate to actual hitting. Also promise or not, you are allowed to take back consent whenever you want. Personally as a female, if a man ever raised his hand to me or said he had anger issues, I would be out.", "You're supposed to pop pimples and blackheads no?", "But I promised", "I guess she doesn't see it the same as consent when I said I promise, I mean I kinda don't see it myself at the end of the day I did promise", "Neither, and overeating means I was already in pain", "Thank you", "But she's trying, she has anger issues and she's been tryna work on it", "Not most of the time.", "No.\n\nSome people do it, but it's a bad habit. It's a pretty solid medical consensus that you should not have an untrained person (you or anyone else) popping your pimples because it increases the likelihood of scarring and of worsening any infection. In fact, it's generally better to leave them alone unless the dermatologist recommends otherwise.\n\nFrom a quick google: [https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/skin-care/popping](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/skin-care/popping)\n\nI wouldn't let her pop your pimples anymore.

It can cause scaring.", "No, you're not. You're creating an open wound", "If it is done hygenically and proper technique, it accelerates healing and should be done. \nIf you go to any profession for a facial or back treatment they will extract \"pop\" them.", "If she promises you sex, she can reneg on that promise any time, right? You don't all of a sudden,  have sexual rights yo her. Same principle applies", "You promised after a fight, right?  Why did you promise her?\n\nTo end the fight?\n\nBecause she threated you with something?  \n\nIn either case, her making you promise to let her pop your pimples was just wrong.  It's your body.  You get to choose if the pimples get popped, who pops them, and so on.\n\nIf you don't want her to pop them... don't let her.  Something's wrong with her...", "Promises are not legally binding contracts. \nYeah, it sucks when someone breaks a promise, but there is a difference when it comes to yours.\nIf you're uncomfortable, then it trjmps her feelings on the matter.", "I can promise my bf to have sex tomorrow but by tomorrow that promise does not have to mean shit. If your gf cared about you, she would respect your autonomy. End of story.", "Oh no OP. If she is threatening you with physical violence because you are calmly asking her not to do something you don't like TO YOUR OWN BODY, she is not working on her anger issues. \n\nShe is using an excuse of 'working on anger issues' to get you to accept entirely unacceptable behaviour. \n\nNo one deserves to be yelled at and threatened. This is abusive behaviour and will only escalate. You need to take care of you and consider this relationship very deeply.", "Good to know thanks", "If I bring that up I'm kinda being dramatic no?", "Thank you", "Well no I mean at that point I was mocking her mocking me so I did push it", "No. It's the same thing", "Does she own you?", "No. There is no excuse for a threat oh physical violence. \n\nHow often does she make you feel like you're at fault her inability to control her anger?", "Well thanks for the eye opener!", "It's bodily autonomy, you have a right to decide what happens to your body and who does it, and you have the right to revoke permission if you are feeling uncomfortable, whether physical pain or emotional distress.  She does not have the right to coerce you.  This is true whether we're talking about popping zits, sex, cutting hair, or even just holding hands."]}
