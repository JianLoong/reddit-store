I was moved by the sweet gesture so there were more people there than initially planned.\n\nOne of my co-workers Hasan is himself from a religious community as far as I know.

I explained that I no longer had it. And asked to keep it between us. Well it didn't stay between us. \n\nHasan confronted me, called me uneducated and told me I could have donated it to a library or something. I said if he had known me even remotely he would know why I did what I did.

Calling you uneducated isn't cool.", "NTA! You've specifically said you're Persian here and from my limited knowledge of Iran (my dad grew up there when it was still Persia, his 2 siblings were born there as grandparents worked in oil) that is a significant statement. \n\nHave your colleagues engaged in any news sources over the last 6 months? \n\nA gift was given, what happens to that gift once you have it is entirely up to you. Could you have given Hasan a softer white lie as to why you no longer have it? Sure, but it does not make you the A, especially with the trauma of living under a religious dictatorship you will carry.\n\nETA someone below has suggested speaking to HR and I very much agree even if just to flag it in case it blows up.", "NTA: he gave you a gift, you accepted politely, and then you did what you wanted with it. Pretty normal stuff. \n\nHe\"s being an AH for presuming too much and  making a big deal about it. People regift and throw away gifts that don't have the same meaning to the receiver as they do to the giver.", "NTA  \nHasan was wrong for assuming you would appreciate the book, wrong for assuming you would keep it, and wrong for assuming anything that he assumed would happen when he gave you a book you didn't want. He's also wrong for confronting you when it was YOUR book to do with what you wanted. I would complain to HR that he is harassing you.", "NTA\n\nA lot of people here are North Americans who simply can't understand the emotional trauma that comes from having to live under a repressive regime. While some people feel that this may not be true in the future if certain people get elected that is neither here nor there. A person placing a religious book into your hands would feel like being compelled to be in the same room with your abuser; it is understandable that you reacted by tearing out a few pages. You sound like you have managed to land somewhere that will not prosecute you for offering offence to a religion or where it is not against the law to be an atheist. If that is the case you do not have to lie to anyone about this. While you could have been more diplomatic, no one but you knows your feelings and no one has a right to sit in judgement.", "NTA. I can't begin to understand what you went through but I threw out every  religion based book my dad sent to me. I feel zero guilt about it. Religious books are not good gifts unless you are absolutely sure the person is religious.\n\nThat dude sent me a letter that his biggest regret in life was I didn't believe in Jesus. Not beating my mother, not hitting me and my brother, not hurting his second wife, not all the other shit he did. Straight in the trash.", "NTA\n\nIt was a gift.  Gifts become the property of the person who receives the gift.  \n\nBeing from Iran, and particularly a FEMALE, you have very justifiable trama from your upbringing.

You probably could have handled telling your coworker differently, or been upfront when the gift was given, but it was yours to do with as you saw fit.", "NTA, once a gift is given it's yours to do with as you please.  For him to judge you for not keeping it is extremely impolite.", "NTA \n\nIt is inappropriate to give a religious gift to a professional coworker. \n\nSaid coworker is presumably aware of the decades of oppression by the Islamic Republic of Iran. \n\nThird coworker was asked to keep quiet.

That is so presumptuous and rude on top of everything else.", "NTA, if he gifted it to you no one is forcing you to keep it.", "NTA \n\nI understand deeply where this feeling is coming from. \n\nEven though he problably didn't mean it badly how he reacted after that was unnecessary and rude. He shouldn't have taken it personally.\n\nIt is a traumatic reminder that awakes feelings and backflashes you wouldn't want to have.. the response to the gift is not one against the giving of the gift or the person that gives but what it represents for that person. It may seem unnecessary but it goes deeper than that. The response was never meant personally to the guy. In fact the accepting and again 'pretending' comes exactly from a point of kindness. However after that you will get hit with a rollercoaster of feelings that result in actions such as these.", "NTA. A gift is a gift. It is not your fault that Hasan assumed you were religious, he could have asked beforehand.", "Couldn't you have simply said 'nicely' to him; thank you for the thought, but I'm not religious and I would rather you gift this to someone who might enjoy reading it?", "ESH\n\nHim: for assuming your religious affiliations (is that the right word?). I hate when people do that. Just give a neutral gift and be done with it unlesss you KNOW that the receiver will go ham for a bible or a rosary. Assuming makes an ass out of you and me. Also that is him pushing his religion down your throat in my opinion.\n\nYou: because, welll, you could have handled it with a little more grace. Donation or giving it back to him with a note saying \"i appreciate the sentiment but as I'm not religious this would be a waste on me\". Or went with the really high road of \"out of sight out of mind\" and place it somewhere only whoever is up there can find it.\n\nI get being anti-organized religion, i am that mysrlf but like it was a gift above all else.

That's on him entirely. Nobody is obligated to keep and care for housewarming gifts they don't want.\n\nI'm not going to judge the way you disposed of the book, either; you're the one who's carrying that history and if it was the right call for you, then so be it. I know if my mother in law tried gifting me something from her religion it would likely suffer the same fate!", "NTA No one should assume religion. No one should be gifting religious items to people if they don't know what their religion is. This is coming from someone whose family is from Iran. Everyone assumes my religion, life, and characteristics. It's rude and has affected me a lot personally.", "NTA\n\nFor anyone who's struggling, just take the religion out of it for a moment: you do not have to keep any gift someone gives you. Period.\n\nIt was a gift, you accepted it graciously, and then you did whatever you wanted with it. That's how gift work.", "NTA, your obligation to Hasan regarding this gift ended at your thanking him for it. It is EXTREMELY tacky of him to even inquire after it, let alone berate you for getting rid of it.", "Nta", "NTA. No one controls a gift. Once it's given as a gift, the person receiving it can do whatever he/she wants to with it.", "NTA - but do you think Hasan gave you the book because he did actually know you arent religious and then enlisted the coworker to ask to borrow it on purpose? \n\nSeems kind of like a set up. Like they wanted to publicly shame you for being an atheist. \n\nEither way they shouldn\u2019t be giving religious material unless they know you are religious. It\u2019s not ok, especially not from a coworker. I would get huge cringe vibes if someone gave me a bible as a house warming gift. And nope, wouldn\u2019t keep it. And I would say \u201cI\u2019m not religious so I didn\u2019t keep it\u201d. But I wouldn\u2019t say I threw it in the trash - but I suspect you didn\u2019t either?", "NTA. And I'm sorry your snitch coworker couldn't keep their trap shut.", "YTA, but not for throwing away the book, but for letting everyone know you did. \n\nHasan chose a housewarming gift he thought you would like. You didn't. But it's rude to let a gift giver know you didn't like their gift. \n\nWhen your coworker asked for it, you could have said you don't currently have it and that perhaps someone could have borrowed it (technically true. Someone COULD have borrowed it if you hadn't thrown it away) and you would let her know if it turned up. Better to say that than to hurt feelings.", "I'm divided, but I lean more towards YTA.\n\nYou have the full right to do as you wish with the book; it's 100% your property. It just seemed unnecessary to me. You couldn't given to someone - destroying the book and ripping its pages is something I cannot fathom doing. It can't be a pleasant feeling  for Hasan to discover the gift he gave you was destroyed, on purpose.", "It's  a bit far to  destroy the book instead of passing it on, in my mind, but once a gift is given, it is up to the recipient what happens to it.

It's much more like... Giving a copy of the bible to a queer or trans person who has been forced to endure a Christian-based conversion therapy camp for years. Except for OP, it's worse than that. There is significant, years-long trauma that OP associates with this religion, not to mention the fact that *the book was a gift, so OP can actually do whatever the fuck they want with it!*", "NTA, but you made a mistake in telling your coworker what happened to it. The best way of keeping a secret is to tell noone. Coworker is an asshole for 'telling' on you, but what's done is done. Might help to stock up on excuses, so in future you have some go-tos. E.g. you don't feel comfortable lending a gift, you lent/gave it away already. (And if you 'lent' it, the lendee can magically have lost it in a couple of months time). If you don't have any excuses stocked, you can stall for time, saying you'll discuss later or just saying no and refusing to elaborate unless the person just won't drop it. A 'no' should be enough, but sometimes it's just easier to stuff in some excuse. \n\nCan understand why it was an offensive enough gift to donate it to the round filing cabinet. But people are never going to be pleased to find out you binned their gift, so I'd avoid telling anyone outside of a partner.\n\nI wouldn't bother bringing it up again, just let the whole thing blow over.

Look at this objectively OP; you were given something you don't like and have no use for by a busybody who thinks their assumed tastes for you (which \"coincidentally\" just happen to line up better with their own) are better than the ones you actually have, even though you vehemently disagree. Why should you feel bad about not disposing of it in a manner that said busybody feels is \"respectful\"?", "All true.
