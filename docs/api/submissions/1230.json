You could have saved a life setting the cops on him . You did good!", "NTA...You already tried resolving things with them.  They did nothing and he stole your car.  Not your kid to parent.", ">This isn't the first time he's pulled shit like this. A few months ago I caught him trying to break into my house when he thought I wasn't home.\n\nThis is all you really needed. NTA", "NTA hell no you aren't being insensitive his parents need to be the obes to stepp up and be parents!", "NTA but is it possible your brother is jealous of your son? It sounds like you had your son when you were 14 years old, which would have made your brother five at the time. Has there been any signs that your brother's behavior problems are the result of jealousy your son receives from you or your parents?", "NTA. He had it coming and they seem like terrible parents.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t need to step up and be a better brother. Your parents need to step up and actually parent their delinquent son.\n\nThey are lucky this is happening when he is 15. This is the time for him to learn his lesson. If he doesn\u2019t sort his shit out now. By the time he hits 18. He will be all ready for big boy jail.", "NTA. You guessed it was him, you didn't know for sure. Could've been anyone. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA\n\nThis kid desperately needs strong consequences. Your father and his wife don't seem capable of imposing the consequences. \n\nYou were right to call the police.", "NTA\n\nJust because he is related to you by blood does not mean he gets a pass to commit crime against you. You warned his parents the last time he tried something on you. Their lack of parenting does not give him a pass either. Besides that, allowing someone like this around your son could potentially be used against you in court, should that ever happen. You made the right call!\n\n\n\nEdited to add a missing word.", "Jesus fuck, what is wrong with parents like this?? Literally this is how dangerous violent men are raised. So entitled. NTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s literally a crime. Better he learn the hard way now before he decides to steal the car of someone who isn\u2019t his relative", "NTA. It was illegal and not the first time he'd done something illegal. He needs to learn consequences.\n\nMake sure to clear out your car in case he left something illegal in it. You would be responsible if the cops find it at a later time.", "NTA male aure to press charges. Explain in court that your concern is his parents allow this conduct and it is escalating. State that they need CPS intervention and parenting classes. Explain to the judge thay after the break in you warned them all it was the last time he got away with his crap. And get an RO.", "NTA- kid sounds like he\u2019s trying to get attention by any means necessary. His parents failed him, not you OP", "NTA. Why do you have to step up? He's THEIR kid.", "NTA\nSounds like the boy\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t want to parent him, and she wants to put that on you. \n\nYou did the right thing by calling the police.", "NTA. His parents are in denial and looking for anyone else to blame but him. As long as they make excuses and he avoids consequences he will continue to act like this.", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to parent your brother, and if his parents were more concerned with his stealing cars at 3am then no one would be in this predicament.", "Nta\n\nHe needs a reality slap before it's too late", ">Around 3 this morning one of my neighbors woke me and said they'd seen a kid with red dreads take off in my car.

If I'm doing my math right, you'd have had your son when you were pretty much your brother's age. Which suggests to me that these challenges with your brother and your family are way, waaaaay beyond Reddit's pay grade, and it might be worth looking into some much more considerable boundaries.\n\n**NTA.**", "I mean you had me until the last line.\n\nYTA for being so so vengeful to a misguided and lost 15 year old boy. You rightly want your car back and sanctity of your property, but maybe show any humanity at all rather than earnestly wishing to damn this child to a scarlet letter for the rest of his professional life? Not saying he shouldnt get it, but your take is gross.\n\nNTA for protecting your property, namely the vehicle that transports you around the world and to your livelihood.", "Nta. He's 15, which is old enough to understand that actions have consequences, and the consequence of breaking the law (theft) is the police turning up.", "NTA. They need to be better parents. He does the crime, he does the time.", "**NTA**\n\nThe fact that he's 15 and you're not even surprised that he stole your car indicates that it is well beyond time that your brother saw some significant consequences for his actions, and it's better that it happens now, on a juvenile record that can be sealed if he can start turning things around, than later. You definitely did the right thing.", "Yeah, NTA. I mean... there are consequences for his actions. \n\nIf his parents can't (or won't) teach him that, then the only people left to do so are the police. Sadly.", "Nta - you are not responsible for being a better role model for your brother. That\u2019s his parent\u2019s job.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nPeople gotta do what people gotta do.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKids gotta be arrested when they act like criminals.", "NTA. He did steal your car. If some random person did that you'd call the police for sure so I don't understand why your parents think this is a family matter. His parents can't control his behavior because a 15 yr old should be home asleep at 3 am. Guess the police and the justice system are going to have to parent him now.", "NTA for setting the boundary and following through, especially since you have a child of your own to care for. \n\nBUT!!! YTA for wanting him to go to jail. \n\nThis is no excuse for the way he is behaving and your dad and stepmom (assuming since you said his mom) are completely out of line and should have put their kid in therapy when they first started acting out. If insurance or money is an issue there are a lot of doctors that do income based therapy or the school may have someone. \n\nWith that said there is obviously something going on in your brothers life, you are not your brother\u2019s keeper, but they need help. Jail probably won\u2019t help and could make the situation worse especially if you live in a state where children are charged as adults. \n\nIf I were you I would see if you can speak with the person that will be trying his case and see if there is an intervention program your state/county offers in lieu of jail time. Usually there is A program for at risk youth where they can go to therapy and learn how to deal with what is going on and stop being an \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udfa9. \nThink about it this way, would you want your son to get help if he was in trouble or would you want him to go to jail and only learn your can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA\n\n> his mom keeps saying that I need to step up and be a better brother to him but I just got full custody of my almost 10 year old son and I don't want my brother around him.\n\nShe needs to step up and be a better parent instead of trying to fob off her responsibility on an adult (half?) sibling.\n\n> his wife is fuckin FURIOUS, saying I should have kept it all between us.\n\nPass. This kid\u2019s choices are fucking up your life. You also needed to call for safety reasons - a 15yo probably doesn\u2019t have a license or much skill in driving, and was a danger on the road.\n\nThey are damn luck he didn\u2019t hurt someone or hit another vehicle.", "NTA, his mom is the \"NOT MY SON!\" kind, he's never had a chance in life. It's sad that his half-brother is the only one making sure he faces consequences.", "NTA - YOU have to step up?!  Sounds like projection. First of all, not your child.  Second of all, if they won't discipline their child, then frankly you did step up by getting the authorities involved. Evidently, they can't handle him.", "Not your kid, you don\u2019t have to \u201cstep up\u201d for anything. Also, auto theft is a serious crime, always report that to the police.

They're always trying to push him off onto me and clearly he doesn't even like me since he's always trying to fuck me over.", "Exactly. I constantly have to remind them I'm only 24 and I've already got my own kid and responsibilities. I don't have time to try to keep up with my brother and when he's doing shit like this to me I honestly don't even want to speak to him.", "I think me getting my baby mama pregnant when I was around his age is part of the reason I'm so pissed that they're letting him get away with shit. \n\nMy goal is to move me and my son to another state sometime next year. Now that his mom is in jail I think it's a legit possibility.", "I understand that it's a shitty of me. I guess my thinking tho is that he's not going to quit doing this kinda stuff until he sees some real consequences.", "NTA but: \"Kids gotta be arrested when they act like criminals.\" \n\nNo just no. Kids being treated like criminals will turn into criminals. \n\nThey got to face consequences, but these got to be educational.", "But his brother is not his son, and OP isn't responsible or has any real influence on his behaviour or upbringing. \n\nPlus, we're not talking about prank calls or vandalism, a 15 yo brat who steals a car could easily end with someone injured or worse.", "\u201cYTA for wanting him to go to jail\u201d\n\nIs she supposed to make an exception and let him get away with a crime? And OP never said she wanted that but it was her best option since this type of incidents have happened many times and their parents would not do anything about it.", "Because they are lazy and obviously they can't handle him either.", "And you shouldn\u2019t have to speak to him. For the sake and safety of your own family (your child) and being the best parent you can be, sometimes you have to set hard boundaries. \n\nUntil your brother can earn a place in your life, consider the ramifications of having that kind of influence around your kid.", "When kids get arrested for crimes they commit they are already criminals.", "Honey, this kid it already committing felonies at 15.
