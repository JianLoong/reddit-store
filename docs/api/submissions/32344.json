We both work full time and our kids are in school during the day.  We've developed a system for childcare and chores that works for us in terms of splitting duties.  Neither of us has set chores.  We alternate bedtime routine pretty much every night and the person not doing bedtime will do dishes, get laundry going, do a quick clean, etc.  This helps us stay on top of things without one person feeling like they're doing more than the other.  \n\nA few months ago my wife was put in a new role at her job.  It came with a small pay bump, but also increased her workload and is more stressful.  As a result, she has a lot less energy at the end of the day.  If I am the one doing bedtime, instead of doing chores, she goes straight to bed.  If she's the one doing bedtime, she goes to bed immediately after the kids go to sleep.  \n\nFor the first few weeks, I was OK with doing all of the evening chores because I knew she was tired from her new role and I wanted to give her time to adjust.  But when her early bedtime routine continued, I started to get frustrated.  \n\nWe had a talk about it and she apologized for not keeping up with evening chores, but she made excuses about being tired from her new job and simply not having energy at the end of the day.  I told her that I'm tired at the end of the day too, but it's not fair to me for her to just go to bed at 9pm every night and leave me to do all the chores.  She said she would try to get better, but nothing has changed and I'm tired of doing all the dishes, laundry, and cleaning every night.  Not to mention that we usually use that evening time for time together, which has been non-existent since her new job as well.  \n\nA couple weeks ago, we had another talk about it and I told her that if she's going to keep going to bed early every night, I'm not going to continue to do all the evening chores on nights I also do bedtime.  If she's doing bedtime, I will do all the chores.  But I won't do them every night anymore. She said she would do better about keeping up with them.  \n\nBut she didn't.  She kept going to bed early every night.  Which meant that if I didn't do the evening chores, they would pile up and I would end up having to do 2-3 days worth.  So, I just stopped doing them too.  \n\nBy the time we got to the weekend, the kids didn't have clean clothes, there were dishes piled up in the sink, and the house was pretty messy.  My wife stepped on a toy that had been left out and got angry that the house was a mess.  She scolded me for not doing the chores the night before since she had done bedtime.  I reminded her that she hadn't been holding up her end of the chores for weeks and she got mad at me.\n\nShe told me that she's still adjusting to her new workload and that I need to pick up some slack in the meantime.  She thinks I am being a jerk by not being more understanding of her new job and how stressful it is.

I don't have the braincells to recognise there's a problem, to pinpoint what it is, or to make a plan to fix it. The number of times I've felt like an idiot once the iron supps kicked in was ridiculous, yet every time, it would take someone else to tell me I looked like I needed a fat steak and a blood transfusion. Rule out anything more serious, too, even if the symptoms coincided with the new job it could have just exacerbated something already going on that she was better able to hide. \n\nDepression can also be a sneaky prick and doesn't always cause sadness - it can present as irritability, fatigue and a general malaise. \n\nMeanwhile, is it feasible to do the chores together as soon as you're both home? Smaller but more frequent workload. Get the kids to pitch in where you can (and where it's helping, not making more work). Reduce the demands by using disposable plates and easy, one pot meals for a while.

However, marriage isn't about score-keeping and winning. It's about team work and supporting one another. And sometimes support means one spouse gets the short end of the stick for awhile. Like how I supported my husband for 8 months while he was laid off but in turn he did more chores. We worked it out even though it wasn't perfectly \"equal.\"", "Shouldn't really affect anything, tbh. If she's working a normal job for normal hours in a non-physical role, I cannot imagine how increased workload is destroying an otherwise healthy adult to the point that they just can't possibly lift a finger to do chores FOR MONTHS.

Without her real buy-in, you're not going to fix the underlying problem. Couples therapy perhaps?", "The wife took ona  better job that pays more for the family which she is now exhausted from and the husband wants everything to stay just the same and burn his wife out.

Partnership isn't about perfect balance. If she has never been there for him before, which considering she's birthed his children, she has, then it wouldn't be balance.

To sleep. She's not scrolling on her phone or playing some game. She's going to sleep. So clearly something has changed or is downright wrong. I'd be dragging her for not doing her share if she was just lazing around, but needing that much more sleep than before should ring some alarm bells.", "Have you never heard of burnout?  Doesn't matter that the hours are the same.  Having a stressful job or being overworked can wreak havoc on your mental health and energy levels.  I've been there.  Wife likey needs medical attention and quite possibly a new job.", "He says it pays incrementally more\u2026not a significant amount more.
