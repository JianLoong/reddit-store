We both work full time and our kids are in school during the day.  We've developed a system for childcare and chores that works for us in terms of splitting duties.  Neither of us has set chores.  We alternate bedtime routine pretty much every night and the person not doing bedtime will do dishes, get laundry going, do a quick clean, etc.  This helps us stay on top of things without one person feeling like they're doing more than the other.  \n\nA few months ago my wife was put in a new role at her job.  It came with a small pay bump, but also increased her workload and is more stressful.  As a result, she has a lot less energy at the end of the day.  If I am the one doing bedtime, instead of doing chores, she goes straight to bed.  If she's the one doing bedtime, she goes to bed immediately after the kids go to sleep.  \n\nFor the first few weeks, I was OK with doing all of the evening chores because I knew she was tired from her new role and I wanted to give her time to adjust.  But when her early bedtime routine continued, I started to get frustrated.  \n\nWe had a talk about it and she apologized for not keeping up with evening chores, but she made excuses about being tired from her new job and simply not having energy at the end of the day.  I told her that I'm tired at the end of the day too, but it's not fair to me for her to just go to bed at 9pm every night and leave me to do all the chores.  She said she would try to get better, but nothing has changed and I'm tired of doing all the dishes, laundry, and cleaning every night.  Not to mention that we usually use that evening time for time together, which has been non-existent since her new job as well.  \n\nA couple weeks ago, we had another talk about it and I told her that if she's going to keep going to bed early every night, I'm not going to continue to do all the evening chores on nights I also do bedtime.  If she's doing bedtime, I will do all the chores.  But I won't do them every night anymore. She said she would do better about keeping up with them.  \n\nBut she didn't.  She kept going to bed early every night.  Which meant that if I didn't do the evening chores, they would pile up and I would end up having to do 2-3 days worth.  So, I just stopped doing them too.  \n\nBy the time we got to the weekend, the kids didn't have clean clothes, there were dishes piled up in the sink, and the house was pretty messy.  My wife stepped on a toy that had been left out and got angry that the house was a mess.  She scolded me for not doing the chores the night before since she had done bedtime.  I reminded her that she hadn't been holding up her end of the chores for weeks and she got mad at me.\n\nShe told me that she's still adjusting to her new workload and that I need to pick up some slack in the meantime.  She thinks I am being a jerk by not being more understanding of her new job and how stressful it is.

My clan knows me too well, and I'd cave, probably within a week, cuz they're gross.\n\nI'm just going to hire a cleaner once I have a job, rather than argue with people who aren't as concerned with cleanliness as I am.  They're a bunch of filthy animals, but they're mine. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut OP is NTA.\n\nPeople shouldn't really just exist in the benefits of a clean home without contributing some effort.", "Literally, all of that applies to the husband as well... In saying that though, this is just really pathetic mental gymnastics you're trying to pull off here, god damn... The husband literally did everything right in this situation up until the very end, where he more than understandably was fed up. If the genders were reversed in this story, would you be so willing to defend the husband and make these ridiculous excuses for him? I get this strange feeling that you wouldn't.", "Lots of \"could be\" in there. I understand everything you're saying. \n\nI don't get why you're off the mindset that he was being petty. Is it at all possible that he is just sick of doing ALL the chores, for months no less, after he explicitly communicated that he couldn't keep going like this? As a mature adult, he communicated his wants. It sounds like the only thing more that you mentioned was that he should've suggested therapy. \n\nI feel bad for the wife, I do. But this is something she brought on herself. Further, her actions have had shitty consequences for her husband.\n\nTruly baffles me that by not putting up with her not picking up (again, because despite communicating to him that she'd do it, but never does), that he's TA. You said ESH, so I assume it means he's TA, as well.", "Lmao are we just going to assume everyone is suffering from some undiagnosed condition now? We solved it guys, let\u2019s shut down this sub cuz it\u2019s gonna be ESH all the way down. \n\nAITA for telling my friend she can\u2019t borrow my clothes anymore because she\u2019s stretching them out due to her size? \u201cESH your friend may be depressed, maybe you should have talked with her before this\u201d. \n\nAITA for not giving my inheritance to my deadbeat uncle? \u201cESH your uncle could be having depression and unable to work and provide for his family. Maybe talk to him to better understand his situation\u201d.\n\nAITA for reporting my friend to the authorities because she broke into my house, robbed me, and killed my dog? \u201cESH because she could be suffering from depression or other mental illness. Why are you being so cruel? Please speak with her and understand things from her point of view\u201d.", "Thanks, that completes my AITA bingo card. All I had left was \"woman being the AH = undiagnosed depression or ADHD\".", "Health issues is what I was thinking.  There are various things that can lead to exhaustion. A new job adds to it and compounds the problem. \n\n\nI\u2019m in this boat (chronic illnesses but look fine) and end up spending weekends stuck in bed unwell if I push too hard during the week.  If I don\u2019t try and get all the chores done, they sit there because OH claims he is too busy.  We both work full time.", "Nowhere did I say this is only the husband's fault. Husband isn't offering any concrete solutions and he's the one who's on Reddit asking questions, so he's the one who's interested in instituting change. I offered suggestions he could put into practice. But if he is just complaining and saying things *should* change when he knows they can't without offering suggestions right now, then he is *part* of the problem.", "It sounds like she is genuinely exhausted, meaning this likely isn\u2019t something she is doing on purpose. This must be so frustrating for both of you - she presumably worked hard to earn this promotion but the pay increase isn\u2019t commensurate to the decrease in energy and quality of life. Her hours haven\u2019t increased but she is obviously putting more energy into those hours in this new position. If she steps down from this position, she might lose out on future opportunities for promotion. \n\nYou say it\u2019s been a few months, but if \"a few months\" means \"less than six months\" she might just need more time to build up the strength and stamina she needs. If she is still learning new information and procedures for this position, she is likely concentrating much harder than she was before and using more energy. You might need to gradually increase the number/amount of chores she\u2019s doing in the evenings instead of sticking with your current all or nothing system. How about you try doing the dishes together each night regardless of who does the bedtime routine? Worst case scenario, it\u2019s still more than what she\u2019s doing now; best case, she slowly gets back to where she was before the new position.\n\nYour wife should see a doctor to rule out any medical issues that might be causing excessive fatigue, like anaemia or certain vitamin deficiencies. Even if there isn\u2019t some obvious medical cause, your doctor might be able to offer advice or treatment to help your wife stay awake past 9 pm. \n\nUltimately, you and your wife need to have a calm but frank conversation about how long you two can live with the strain this new position is taking on both of you. The pay increase isn\u2019t enough to cover the cost of a cleaner and you are unhappy about picking up the slack. Don\u2019t try to have this conversation in the evening when you are both tired or on a school morning when chaos reigns.", "You are not giving her the benefit of the doubt, and that\u2019s the biggest concern here.", "My parents had two big glass jars and a bowl of marbles. Every time we did a chore without being asked, we would let them know and they'd put a marble in the jar. Once it was full we could ask for anything (within reason). Might be $10 (maximum for a full jar) or it might be a trip to the zoo or it might be having our favorite food for dinner. We had some autonomy. I actually used those jars to save $200 as a kid to buy an action figure set I wanted. Taught us to look for things to do and ask for ways to help out. Probably not good for these kids' ages though.", "I do this a lot when heating up food in the microwave, waiting on the oven to pre-heat etc.. How much kitchen cleanup can I do before the timer goes off/the pasta is finished, the oven is hot...? It is amazing how much can get done in those small spaces of time. I have always been very much a 'clean up as you cook/bake' person so I suppose that helps.\n\nOP - NTA, but I would say you should still do what chores you can in the time you normally spent on chores (on the nights she puts them to bed). Two negatives don't make a positive. Get the kiddos to help clean up, they are old enough for small chores - at their ages they can easily pick up after themselves and help put away laundry/dishes (or load the dishwasher). Obviously, your wife needs to figure things out on her end to get things back to 'normal', but there is no reason the littles can't help out at their ages. That will help you both and teach them important life skills.", "\u201cIf I\u2019m just holding the table for\nNo reason I just feel silly then \u201c", "That's fantastic!", "I have a cleaning person come twice a month for 2.5 hours. It has been life changing.", "I did similarly bad math \ud83d\ude06, but for me it was a reading comprehension issue (I read 60hrs x$25)", "It is work, but they need to learn eventually and they could do separate chores or learn to do it in stages.", "You both sound like \u201cwe\u2019ve tried nothing and we\u2019re all out of ideas!\u201d", "It sounds like she is truly exhausted from work, and you are truly exhausted from the household load. Sometimes it's important to reset expectations. \n\nMaybe it's time to handle everything differently.", "What jobs specifically need done? The kids are old enough to pick up their toys and pick up their dirty clothes and put away their clothes for example. Do you have space for a dishwasher? Maybe put that small pay bump aside to save for one.", "I never said the husband had a communication issue, I explicitly said they both communicated about the issue and both knew it wasn't sustainable. *Neither of them* worked on a solution, both expected to get back into a routine that did not work with the new job long past the tipping point.", "It's not \"mental gymnastics,\" it's a suggestion for something to look into as one of the main characteristics of depression is laid out right in his story. The sudden change or going to bed early? Dude, I've had depression and avoiding responsibilities in the way OP is describing is a major symptom. Do I know for sure? No, I'm not a psychologist. I never said she is innocent in all of this. And OP did a great job talking to her about it and has every right to be frustrated.\n\nIf he's more concerned with being \"right,\" then by all means, he should continue to not clean at all. But if he actually cares about her wellbeing, he would make sure to address that first before just saying screw it, I'm not picking up at all.", "You asked \"What more would you want him to do,\" and that's my answer. Many people in other comments also offered that he could approach her with a new plan, or at least a \"ok, the current situation is clearly not working out, what are some other options.\"\n\nHe certainly did everything right up until he decided not to clean at all. He is entitled to feel frustrated, and it would have been fine if he only cleaned up his share. But this is the person he is spending his life with. When she does a full 180 on something she's been consistent on, he should be worried that something is wrong. But instead he seems more focused on being right.", "That only comes out when its a wife being an AH. We do that because it gives them an excuse and this sub loves excusing wives.", "I really like this.  Thanks for sharing!", "We did something similar in my home when I was a kid, it worked very well and I intend to implement the same strategy with my kids one day. :)", "You don't need to be a psychologist to understand that the reason she is going to bed early isn't because of depression. She's taken on more work than she can handle. You read the story and then started making up your own shit to try and make it so that the wife isn't in the wrong when she clearly is... That's mental gymnastics. He clearly isn't concerned with \"being right\" either, he's fed up with having everything dumped on him. To read this story and be so incredibly far off the mark, you are either incredibly dumb or you are intentionally misreading the story so you can insert your own narrative. Again, if the genders were reversed, would you be so willing to die on this hill for the husband who is now going to bed early and making the wife do all the chores? No, you wouldn't because you're already trying to attack the husband in this situation.", "You really can't see the hypocrisy of your position, can you?\n\nThis is what you are saying, literally: it's okay for OP to pick up the wife's slack because she might have issues, but it's not okay to expect the wife to pick up his slack because he can't have issues if he's a responsible adult.\n\nPlease tell me you can see how that's bonkers logic.", "I barely see anyone bringing up things like mental disorders or depression when a man doesn't pull his weight.\n\nBut when its a wife everybody comes rolling out with the excuses", "Do you realize you quoted yourself?"]}
