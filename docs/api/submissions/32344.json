We both work full time and our kids are in school during the day.  We've developed a system for childcare and chores that works for us in terms of splitting duties.  Neither of us has set chores.  We alternate bedtime routine pretty much every night and the person not doing bedtime will do dishes, get laundry going, do a quick clean, etc.  This helps us stay on top of things without one person feeling like they're doing more than the other.  \n\nA few months ago my wife was put in a new role at her job.  It came with a small pay bump, but also increased her workload and is more stressful.  As a result, she has a lot less energy at the end of the day.  If I am the one doing bedtime, instead of doing chores, she goes straight to bed.  If she's the one doing bedtime, she goes to bed immediately after the kids go to sleep.  \n\nFor the first few weeks, I was OK with doing all of the evening chores because I knew she was tired from her new role and I wanted to give her time to adjust.  But when her early bedtime routine continued, I started to get frustrated.  \n\nWe had a talk about it and she apologized for not keeping up with evening chores, but she made excuses about being tired from her new job and simply not having energy at the end of the day.  I told her that I'm tired at the end of the day too, but it's not fair to me for her to just go to bed at 9pm every night and leave me to do all the chores.  She said she would try to get better, but nothing has changed and I'm tired of doing all the dishes, laundry, and cleaning every night.  Not to mention that we usually use that evening time for time together, which has been non-existent since her new job as well.  \n\nA couple weeks ago, we had another talk about it and I told her that if she's going to keep going to bed early every night, I'm not going to continue to do all the evening chores on nights I also do bedtime.  If she's doing bedtime, I will do all the chores.  But I won't do them every night anymore. She said she would do better about keeping up with them.  \n\nBut she didn't.  She kept going to bed early every night.  Which meant that if I didn't do the evening chores, they would pile up and I would end up having to do 2-3 days worth.  So, I just stopped doing them too.  \n\nBy the time we got to the weekend, the kids didn't have clean clothes, there were dishes piled up in the sink, and the house was pretty messy.  My wife stepped on a toy that had been left out and got angry that the house was a mess.  She scolded me for not doing the chores the night before since she had done bedtime.  I reminded her that she hadn't been holding up her end of the chores for weeks and she got mad at me.\n\nShe told me that she's still adjusting to her new workload and that I need to pick up some slack in the meantime.  She thinks I am being a jerk by not being more understanding of her new job and how stressful it is.

She's legitimately tired and, I don't know about you two, but it took me 6-8 months to adjust to a newer, more demanding job so this will inevitably continue. The one place she was wrong and should apologize for is for snapping at you for not doing what she's also not doing (though it was petty of you to stop everything and not pitch in extra during this transition). \n\nMy suggestion is for you two to sit down at a neutral time, maybe on a weekend when you feel less tired, and make a new plan together. Your routine that used to work is no longer working and you need to solve it as a team. Try to set aside annoyance and resentment because at the end of the day, you both want to same result and both want to divide things equitably right? \n\n~~Lastly, if her job requires more time spent working, I think it's fair to work that in so you two each get fairly equal downtime each day/week. So if she's now working 60 hours and you work 40, that's 20 hours less time she is getting to do chores and relax.~~ Edit: OP clarified in another comment that her time spent working has not changed.", "ESH - figure this out.

I get it, new jobs can be demanding but she had multiple months to adjust. If she is not adjust by now, maybe she need to see a doctor to check if everything is alright with her. \n\nIts not fair to you to have all the household duties, while she gonna rest. Plus, your relationship, as a couple and a team, will implode if she keep acting like this. \n\nYou have been \"picking some slack\" for her and her new job for months.

You're two smart, hardworking people, how is this so hard to figure out? You need a new routine that isn't driven by spite. Some of the evening chores need to become morning chores.
