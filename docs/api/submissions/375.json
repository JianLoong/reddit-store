However, I would say for them to call after 8 only in cases of extreme emergencies such as Grandma/Mom has fallen, or there's a fire.   I understand that there are times when your mother needs your help with some of the heavy lifting or things like furniture assembly once in a while.

It's not just for your convenience, it's for your mental health. Being upset and pissy on a daily basis isn't good for you and it isn't good for your daily interactions with your family. It doesn't help maintain a positive relationship with them if you're snappy or upset all the time. I hope you have a discussion with them and they take it well.", "NTA... I'd just make this policy.  I dont take calls after 8.  Done make exceptions.  Turn off ringer if it is not respected.

I got that fixed.\n\nYeah ik there are cases of emergencies but I\u2019m not sure how to make that happen.

Little requests are totally fine and understandable but when it\u2019s during my own time that\u2019s a little irritating.", "Agree, NTA. But if you live with your mom and grandma, why are they calling you, when you are home? Or are they calling you in the evenings when you are out? I guess it doesn\u2019t matter, but they do need to accept that you need your own time and that your evenings are your own, unless there\u2019s a real emergency.", "For politeness sake (if you choose that route), I would just say \"By the way, mom, grandma, I've got to stay on top of my very challenging school work, so I'm devoting 8pm-bedtime for homework/school projects.

We also have one for taking the dogs out (so others know when they went and to keep them from meeting as they don't get along), also a chat to post our meal plan for the night so everyone knows and can join if they want.\n\nMy fav use for it is I have always had anxiety sleeping if ai felt I needed to tell someone something, so as a kid my mom had me write in a journal and leave it outside her room. Now with tech we do the same with telegram. We have a chat for the two of us we keep our notification sounds off on, so we can message each other at any hour and then when the person is up or not busy they see it.\n\nThe family chat had notifications on, on the other hand, and we use it for important to read or emergencies only.\n\nIt's been a great system when we lived in different states and had time zone differences, and now as well when we are all together. I feel like our doing that and not calling has made it easier to know when something is urgent or not.", "Thanks for adding that.  I was thinking along those lines."]}
