{"id": 6296, "submission_id": "101e34b", "title": "AITA for not inviting my stepmother to my wedding?", "selftext": "I (32f) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (38m) this year. My parents separated when I was 14 years old. My dad left my mum for his secretary (I'll call her Anna), after my mum was in an accident that left her badly visibly scarred, leaving her to raise my two sisters (both 25, twins) and me alone. This completely devastated my mum, and she was depressed for a long time. She's okay now, but she's never completely recovered.\n\nI'm the oldest child by a long stretch, and I was basically left to raise my sisters and look after my mum for a lot of my teenage years. I was very, very angry for a long time, and I refused to see my dad until I was in my mid-20s. Both my younger sisters were slightly too young to grasp what had happened and continued to visit him (on weekends only). They bonded a lot better with Anna than I did, and in many ways, she was like a \"mum\" to them. She introduced them to a lot of \"female\" things, like make-up and fashion, because my mum's scarring meant she didn't feel comfortable with that kind of thing.\n\nI started speaking to my dad again about seven years ago, and we now have an *okay* relationship. I understand a lot better at this age that love isn't easy, and you can't help who you fall for. I'm also on reasonable terms with his wife, who has tried extremely hard to bond with me since I was a teenager.\n\nMy mum has never fully recovered from what happened and never found anyone else. She can just about stand being in the same room as my dad without crying nowadays, but she absolutely cannot see his wife. She's not cruel or dramatic about this - she just politely declines invitations to events if she knows Anna will be present.\n\nFor previous events (like graduations), Anna has always declined the invite, saying she doesn't want to put my mum in an uncomfortable position, and pushed my dad to go alone. However, with my wedding, things haven't exactly gone like that. I tried to be as nice as I could about it, and I invited Anna out for a meal and told her that I was sorry, but that it was more important to me to have my mum at my wedding than her, so I was going to have to ask her not to come to the wedding. Anna said that she understood, that she expected it, and that I needed to do what was best for my mum.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, became extremely angry at me when he heard. He called me up and essentially said if she's not coming, then he's not. Both my sisters have found out about this, and they're extremely upset with me, too and are also threatening not to come.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the arsehole here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update**: Thanks all - your comments have made me see sense.\n\nI'm going to take my dad up on his offer not to come and let my sisters know they're welcome not to either. My mum's my best friend. She's been there for me my entire life, even through her own misery. If no one else comes, but she's there, I'll be happy.  \n\n\n**Update 2:** Called my dad. Tried to appease/ diffuse the situation by apologising. Tried to explain that I understand his point of view, and that I respect his relationship, but that I can't ask mum to go through that, and that it would spoil the day for *me* knowing the pain she'd be going through. Asked him if he'd consider doing something just the four of us (him, Anna, me, fianc\u00e9) or maybe the six of us with my sisters. A nice dinner somewhere, paid for by my fianc\u00e9 and I, so we can celebrate our union together. He hung up the phone. **So there you go, voil\u00e0, my dad.** ", "created_utc": 1672670218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101e34b/aita_for_not_inviting_my_stepmother_to_my_wedding/", "score": 1057, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When her mother was vulnerable, he abandoned her because she wasn't perfect anymore, she was damaged. He decided to cheat and then left her mother for a new, perfect version.  \n\nThis devastated the family and because the mum was recovering from her injuries, the trauma of her accident and the trauma of being cheated on and being divorced, OP had to step up and look after her sisters. She lost parts of her childhood whilst her dad was off with his mistress turned wife. \n\nHe made decisions that caused OP and her mother immense pain, and now he wants her to hurt her own mother so he can get his way again. He is once again placing his new wife ahead of his family. \n\nAnd the sisters don't get it. They were young enough that they didn't see ir notice too much, and that will partly be because OP helped to maintain normality for them. I'd ask how they'd feel if their husband and the father of their children cheated on them and abandoned them because they had an accident. Would they be comfortable? Would they be able to just move on? Every time OP's mum looks at her scars, she must feel like they cost her her family.\n\nAll this is the end result of OP's dad's decisions, and not he and her sisters want to punish OP for that. The past does not remain in the past when a person is still living in and with the consequences. OP's dad and sisters are making it so OP has to choose between them and the mum. \n\nNTA. Honestly, I'd just elope. I guarantee this will cause problems with OP's family with people taking sides, so I'd cut it off by just going to the courthouse with whichever witnesses my fianc\u00e9e and I wanted most, and I'd tell them after the fact. If there's no wedding, there's no squabbling over invites.

It further mentions that her mom is uncomfortable being in the same room as her step-mom. You know, the attractive unscarred woman that her husband left her for after she was in a terrible accident? I just don't think this is really an issue of the mistress being left out of the grace of forgiveness. NTA OP.", "Right? A married woman whose wife had just been in a horrible accident.

I do recall something about \u2018in sickness and in health\u2019, which I\u2019m guessing OPs father ignored along with everything else.

She was left alone with 3 children having most of the custody while her ah ex got to be the fun weekend disney dad. Anna deserves to be excluded and frankly, so does the AH guy. He broke his vows of being there in sickness and in health and ditched when the going got bad. Her mother has to look in the mirror for the rest of her life and be constantly reminded that her husband left her and made her feel like the ugliest person in the world for something she had no control over. Anna is absolutely a cause for the divorce. She had an affair with a married man while knowing what happened to his wife. No sympathy whatsoever.

Good luck and congrats on your wedding, I hope it goes smoothly!\n\nYou also need to figure out with your mom on what you guys will do when your sisters get married.

As for Anna, I am glad she is at least normal and understanding about you and not intruding.\n\nAnd if your sisters don't see the big reason why you would choose one over the other then, well, either try and explain to them or if they still are stubbornly refusing to understand, then shame on them.\n\nIt is your wedding and you can dictate who you want to see there. It is a shame most family wont be there to see you, but it is their loss and as long as you are happy with the choice you make it won't matter.", "NTA throw them all out and go NC.

My mom and dad have always hated each other since their divorce (it was messy and really soured their relationship). My father is a surgeon and my mother was at the time his office manager but became a hospital executive after the divorce and both have done well. We were 5 (me, female) and 3 (little sis) and my mother threatened to drag us into court to testify unless my dad consented to an absurd amount of monthly child support. My moms second husband was terrible and very abusive to me. We were with our dad Mondays, Wednesdays and every other weekend and were with our mom the rest of the time. I kept going back and forth until I was 11 years old and my mothers second divorce was finalized so I knew my little sister was safe. Then I left and lived with my dad full time (my mom wanted 2/3 of the child support she used to get but finally settled for half). I didn't see my mother from the time I was 11 until I was 16 even though we lived in the same town. If she would call, I'd set the phone down and call for my sister. My dad was and always will be my best friend in the world. He gets me, he always took amazing care of my sister and I, and he's such a good person. \n\nWe have a semi-okay relationship now (her new husband is okay) but it will always be strained.
