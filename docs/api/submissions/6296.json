My parents separated when I was 14 years old. My dad left my mum for his secretary (I'll call her Anna), after my mum was in an accident that left her badly visibly scarred, leaving her to raise my two sisters (both 25, twins) and me alone. This completely devastated my mum, and she was depressed for a long time. She's okay now, but she's never completely recovered.\n\nI'm the oldest child by a long stretch, and I was basically left to raise my sisters and look after my mum for a lot of my teenage years. I was very, very angry for a long time, and I refused to see my dad until I was in my mid-20s. Both my younger sisters were slightly too young to grasp what had happened and continued to visit him (on weekends only). They bonded a lot better with Anna than I did, and in many ways, she was like a \"mum\" to them. She introduced them to a lot of \"female\" things, like make-up and fashion, because my mum's scarring meant she didn't feel comfortable with that kind of thing.\n\nI started speaking to my dad again about seven years ago, and we now have an *okay* relationship. I understand a lot better at this age that love isn't easy, and you can't help who you fall for. I'm also on reasonable terms with his wife, who has tried extremely hard to bond with me since I was a teenager.\n\nMy mum has never fully recovered from what happened and never found anyone else. She can just about stand being in the same room as my dad without crying nowadays, but she absolutely cannot see his wife. She's not cruel or dramatic about this - she just politely declines invitations to events if she knows Anna will be present.\n\nFor previous events (like graduations), Anna has always declined the invite, saying she doesn't want to put my mum in an uncomfortable position, and pushed my dad to go alone. However, with my wedding, things haven't exactly gone like that. I tried to be as nice as I could about it, and I invited Anna out for a meal and told her that I was sorry, but that it was more important to me to have my mum at my wedding than her, so I was going to have to ask her not to come to the wedding. Anna said that she understood, that she expected it, and that I needed to do what was best for my mum.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, became extremely angry at me when he heard. He called me up and essentially said if she's not coming, then he's not. Both my sisters have found out about this, and they're extremely upset with me, too and are also threatening not to come.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the arsehole here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Thanks all - your comments have made me see sense.\n\nI'm going to take my dad up on his offer not to come and let my sisters know they're welcome not to either. My mum's my best friend. She's been there for me my entire life, even through her own misery. If no one else comes, but she's there, I'll be happy.", "created_utc": 1672670218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101e34b/aita_for_not_inviting_my_stepmother_to_my_wedding/", "score": 514, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also kudos to Anna for both making such an effort with you and being so gracious", "Best point. \u201c Your wedding, your guest list.\u201d", "I think OP needs to honestly tell her dad what he's put her and her mother through. When her mother was vulnerable, he abandoned her because she wasn't perfect anymore, she was damaged. He decided to cheat and then left her mother for a new, perfect version.  \n\nThis devastated the family and because the mum was recovering from her injuries, the trauma of her accident and the trauma of being cheated on and being divorced, OP had to step up and look after her sisters. She lost parts of her childhood whilst her dad was off with his mistress turned wife. \n\nHe made decisions that caused OP and her mother immense pain, and now he wants her to hurt her own mother so he can get his way again. He is once again placing his new wife ahead of his family. \n\nAnd the sisters don't get it. They were young enough that they didn't see ir notice too much, and that will partly be because OP helped to maintain normality for them. I'd ask how they'd feel if their husband and the father of their children cheated on them and abandoned them because they had an accident. Would they be comfortable? Would they be able to just move on? Every time OP's mum looks at her scars, she must feel like they cost her her family.\n\nAll this is the end result of OP's dad's decisions, and not he and her sisters want to punish OP for that. The past does not remain in the past when a person is still living in and with the consequences. OP's dad and sisters are making it so OP has to choose between them and the mum. \n\nNTA. Honestly, I'd just elope. I guarantee this will cause problems with OP's family with people taking sides, so I'd cut it off by just going to the courthouse with whichever witnesses my fianc\u00e9e and I wanted most, and I'd tell them after the fact. If there's no wedding, there's no squabbling over invites. Then OP could do a dinner with her mum and other family to celebrate, and a dinner with her dad and sisters separately (if OP still wants to deal with them).", "I agree so much", "I think it's more about her mom having an issue with the step-mom than OP punishing or not forgiving her step mom for being the mistress. Also her mom is clearly still dealing with a lot of trauma over this and the post says that she's only recently been able to be in the same room as her ex-husband(OP's dad). It further mentions that her mom is uncomfortable being in the same room as her step-mom. You know, the attractive unscarred woman that her husband left her for after she was in a terrible accident? I just don't think this is really an issue of the mistress being left out of the grace of forgiveness. NTA OP.", "Right? A married woman whose wife had just been in a horrible accident.

I do recall something about \u2018in sickness and in health\u2019, which I\u2019m guessing OPs father ignored along with everything else. When you make a commitment to a person, it doesn\u2019t come with conditions. And if you genuinely try to make it work and it just won\u2019t, have the respect to end things in a way the keeps everyone involved whole.

Make your choices.", "This response is full of s**te, really. This is not enabling her mother, her mother went through something traumatizing and has to live with that for the rest of her life. She was left alone with 3 children having most of the custody while her ah ex got to be the fun weekend disney dad. Anna deserves to be excluded and frankly, so does the AH guy. He broke his vows of being there in sickness and in health and ditched when the going got bad. Her mother has to look in the mirror for the rest of her life and be constantly reminded that her husband left her and made her feel like the ugliest person in the world for something she had no control over. Anna is absolutely a cause for the divorce. She had an affair with a married man while knowing what happened to his wife. No sympathy whatsoever. OP had to make sacrifices and help her mother with her siblings when her father wouldn't.

Even as a teenager, I resented my dad, not her.\n\nMy mum has forgiven neither of them, and can only just about bear being around my dad for the sake of me and my sisters.

Good luck and congrats on your wedding, I hope it goes smoothly!\n\nYou also need to figure out with your mom on what you guys will do when your sisters get married.

So help your mom make the most of your wedding instead.", "Jesus Christ. Your poor mom.

As for Anna, I am glad she is at least normal and understanding about you and not intruding.\n\nAnd if your sisters don't see the big reason why you would choose one over the other then, well, either try and explain to them or if they still are stubbornly refusing to understand, then shame on them.\n\nIt is your wedding and you can dictate who you want to see there. It is a shame most family wont be there to see you, but it is their loss and as long as you are happy with the choice you make it won't matter.", "NTA throw them all out and go NC.

My dad tried something similar; the family eventually stopped accommodating him.", "NTA", "well done its your wedding and if they dont like it then its there lose not yours. as you say your mum will be there thats all you really need good luck NTA but your sisters should start looking in the mirror and see how your mum has been all there lives", "You're not NTA for the simple fact it's your wedding.\n\nBut, reading between the lines Anna seems 'ok' and has been quite considerate to you and your mum's feelings for a long time, whilst your dad seems to have got away scott free.\n\nCan they not all just tolerate/avoid each other for a single day, and help you celebrate? That would surely be the dream scenario", "NTA", "NTA\u2026.. If you want to  get in a better relationship with your sisters I would suggest sitting them down and let them know everything. Don\u2019t protect your mom or your dad let them know exactly what happened.", "NTA.\nYour dad created this situation. Every decision has a consequence. This is one of them for him.", "NTA - and credit where it's due, good for Anna.", "NTA. Prop for standing up for your mom, screw the home wrecker and the treacherous loser dad.", "Not sure why dad or sisters think Anna should get an invite if you\u2019re not particularly close to her. She\u2019s close family to them, but not to you. And with history as complicated and sad as this, she\u2019s not entitled to be embraced or included.

Congrats!", "NTA, it\u2019s for the best if your dad doesn\u2019t come honestly.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll add that I didn\u2019t invite my mother to my wedding over a decade ago.  I won\u2019t get into all that led to that decision. I have never, ever regretted it. Not for one second.", "NTA\n\nWhat is your father gonna even do at the wedding? Escort you down the aisle and watch as your partner vows to love you in sickness and in health? Like he knows what that's like.\n\nAnd your sisters are old enough to know better that abandoning your wife and kids cuz her face was scarred by an accident is wrong. I hope every single partner they have is aware of this standard. Protect your looks cuz it's the only thing keeping you with them. Anna is messed up for thinking that standard is ok.\n\nKick them out of life, you have the person that matters.", "NTA. You absolutely have the right to prioritise your mom. Your dad sucks for what ge did regardless. Tbh, I could never be that forgiving, to give a person like your dad a chance for any relationship whatsoever.", "Dad is the AH. He cheated on your mum so why wouldn\u2019t you have your mums back. Props to AP for understanding though and not kicking off about it.", "Reading the update, it's good that you made that decision. Just as your father abandoned your mother, I see no problem with you now abandoning him and your sisters too if they side with him.\r  \n\r  \nI hope you do an update if something happens at the wedding or after that.", "NTA. Your dad chooses his mistress/wife over you AGAIN. Just tell him he's not welcome. Your sisters can do as they want. But you might want to tell them exactly what their father did, and if they choose him, it proves that they don't care about you. \n\nLC or NC for the father if he doesn't come to the wedding.", "Honestly I wouldn't want either of them there. Her for obvious reasons but having a father that couldn't honor his own vows....for better or worse, in sickness or in health...not someone I would want to celebrate my own union", "NTA OP\nObviously, why would you want a \"father\" who abandoned his family and a home wrecker to be at your wedding? \n\nThis is ridiculous.", "unpopular opinion, but YTA. \n\nobviously your dad went batshit, it\u2019s his wife. he has to defend her because that\u2019s his job and what he signed up to do.\ni get that it\u2019s your wedding, and you can invite and uninvite whoever you want, but, imo, if you started to mend things with your dad, it also means you have to accept your stepmom as she\u2019s a very important part of his life.\n\ni think you\u2019re still carrying a lot of your moms hurt, which is not your place.  throughout the post you kept mentioning how it\u2019s your mom that has a problem with her, and, as far as the context your post gives, your stepmom never did anything to you, if anything, she tried to bond! \ni get your mother\u2019s hurt, but why should you accommodate everything around her? it\u2019s your and your partner\u2019s day! idk, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me why you\u2019re the one dealing with your mothers hurt instead of her.\n\neither way, it\u2019s your wedding so have at it ig!", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is a major AH and neglected her kids and abused you by parentifying you. You are punishing your dad and your stepmom for that.", "Beautifully summed up.", "This is a bit unfair, because the stepmother is not demanding a spot at the wedding, only the dad is demanding she be invited. Stepmother understands why she's not invited, never expected to be invited, and told OP to do what's best for OP's mom.", "Exactly this I maybe understand not wanting to be with his wife but why did he leave and abandon them.\n\nHe could have done so many better ways,he could have moved out nearby and been more active with raising his children and and showing Compassion to his ex wife and not put the the burden of raising her sisters and caring for the mother of his children on his very young daughter.\n\nHe sounds totally heartless.", "I currently have the top post in here, but it needs to be this one instead. *chef\u2019s kiss*", "Summed up quite nicely.\n\nNTA Op, at all.", "You 100% can help who you love, or at least how you choose to act on it. \n\nIf you start getting feelings for someone who is not your spouse or someone who you think it's unhealthy for you to be with for some other reason you can walk away from the person you shouldn't be loving. \n\nYou invest more time into your spouse or you get yourself a new hobby. New love insanity/infatuation usually only lasts 1-2 years at best and it can be much less than that if you starve the feeling and don't let yourself obsess over it. \n\n\"Can't help who you love\" is an excuse.", "Agreed I would not be forgiving either. Marriage is hard work with peaks, valleys and plateaus. If the marriage is irreparably broken, get a divorce then start dating. Cheaters suck and people that date married people suck. Neither have morals and I would have no use for either one.", "[removed]", "Can you imagine going into a relationship knowing they don't mean their vows?

The op is holding something that's not her burden to hold. \n\nOP, I understand your mams hurt, and she never has to have a relationship with your dad or his wife again, but if you dowant to, then she needs to tolerate them. \n\nThis is her responsibility as a parent.

It is easy to blame one parent when there is a divorce. Most adults understand that neither spouse is a victim in a divorce. If one parent badmouths the other, a child will accept that story, especially if the other parent doesn't fight back. So you often end up siding with the bitter parent.", "Oh no, I did say take whichever witnesses they want. If that means a good chunk of your fianc\u00e9's family, how are the dad and his wife to know? \n\nThere's no way OP can win, so you just cut them out of the equation. If you have a big wedding without them, it can give them ammo. If OP takes her mum and those OP and their fiance are closest to and elope, there's no arguments beforehand with her dad and his side of the family.", "I mean the separation was also though for OP. I mean being left after a disfiguring accident for a secretary is pretty much being the victim. It could be more the story but OP'S father was shitty. The sisters were young and went to their weekend dad that was fun instead of the depressed mother."]}
