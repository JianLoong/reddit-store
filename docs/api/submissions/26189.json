She is getting married in 2 weeks and her dress code is incredibly complicated to adhere to for me. It is black tie, long sleeves and floor length gowns. The conflict happened because  I am currently 34 weeks pregnant and overheat very quickly, and the wedding is entirely outside, in the middle of the day, in the southern USA where it is incredibly hot, I cannot be in a long sleeve floor length gown in the heat for 8 hours. \n\nI have sent her a few dresses to try to compromise which I will link in the comments for further information but she is completely adamant about exactly what she wants. \n\nI told her yesterday that I cannot attend her wedding if she is not going to budge even slightly on the dress code. I told her she has the right to have her wedding exactly how she wants it, for it to be her perfect day but I have the right to look out for my own health. \n\n\nShe freaked out at me and told me I was being incredibly selfish and that \u201cfor once it isn\u2019t about me and my fucking baby\u201d which she only said because she\u2019s jealous I\u2019m having the first grandchild and she felt like she should have had a baby before me and my husband. \n\nSince then my husbands side of the family has told me I\u2019m being selfish and to just compromise one day to keep the peace.

This should silence the rest of the family. Honestly, the minute she cursed at your baby was the minute you and your husband did the right thing to not go to the wedding.", "Sweetie, if my SIL said this to me (especially calling your baby \u201cyour fucking kid), I would not only skip her wedding, but I would not allow her anywhere around me or my baby when it arrives. \n\nWhy is your husband not putting his sister in check? She is the one that is being selfish here, and I would not humor her in this. Just stay home & be comfortable. She needs to realize that her and \u201cher fuckin wedding\u201d are not the most important thing going on in anyone\u2019s life but the bridal couple. And, tbh, being 32 weeks pregnant trumps a wedding every time when it comes to the mom-to-he\u2019s comfort as opposed to the aesthetic she wants to achieve for a photo op. \n\nIf you try to attend this outdoors wedding in long sleeves in the South, girl, you\u2019re likely to get nauseous, dizzy and lightheaded and are more likely to cause a bigger scene at her wedding when they have back an ambulance into the venue & the paramedics rush in to tend to the pregnant lady whose SIL caused her to almost have a heat stroke. \n\nIs she demanding every female guest to wear long sleeves or has she just singled you out for her own vindictive pleasures?", "Go look at Macys online for maternity dresses and look at the ones that have a \"boho\" feel.

She has made a dangerous request for not just you being pregnant, but for those attending. I'm in the Midwest and it is currently 97 degrees and we have heat advisories for the elderly and those that are pregnant (basically those at risk). I would never sacrifice my pregnancy for such a meaningless request.\n\nEDIT: I'm so unbelievably irritated by this. I recently attended a wedding where we had to wait 5 minutes to enter for dining while the bride switched seat arrangements because she had 3 pregnant women and she wanted to switch them to a table that got better air flow.

Did you go to her first wedding?  What was it like.?", "*checks notes* She\u2019s nearing 40, and this is her second wedding. Why is she acting like a 20 year old princess bride?! Who enforces such a strict dress code for a summer wedding in the grass?! The comment about your child too, was nasty and dripping with jealousy.
