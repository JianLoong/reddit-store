Looked right at me and with the smirk you described said \"no I didn't\".\n\nI know what kind of inhuman he is. He promised monogamy and honesty and fell short by a million miles, 25 years ago. But he promised me - nobody else made me an oath of authenticity. His friends didn't promise me anything, nor did the woman he's seeing. I don't hate them. It hurts thinking they know, but that's more like feeling ashamed that they think I'm stupid.\n\nHe doesn't have a big social group. One of his buddies sometimes spends the night if they decide to drink, which I do not mind at all. I enjoy his friend's company, but stay out of the way and let them have fun. His friend is super nice to me, and I can tell he genuinely does like me as a person (we both smoke so we get stuck outside together sometimes). I think he's a good person.\n\nHowever, he knows. And he does not tell me. And I don't hate him for staying silent. I understand he values his friendship with my husband, and that's okay.\n\nPeople put up with all kinds of crappy behaviours in their friends. Not saying it's right or wrong but it's true. I have an old friend who sneaks cigarettes behind her husband's back. I like her husband but I don't tell him - and he's threatened to divorce if she smokes. I wish I did not know, but I refuse to make the decision to potentially torch their marriage.\n\nAfter having a long time of learning to deal with the cheating etc., I decided something about how I wanted to deal with befriending people. If I make a friend now and she tells me she cheats, I'm not running to her husband. I don't know the whole story and I don't know what will result if I do. There really are people out there who don't wanna know.\n\nBut, I can walk away and decide I'd rather not be friends with someone who is exceptionally dishonest. I don't have to bear witness to any of it. I don't have to feel guilty. I just have to part ways.\n\nWhere I depart from my own ethics is this - I think you did the right thing when she asked you directly, in front of him, knowing he was standing there enjoying it. I think you learned more about your friend than the affair - you learned he was actually cruel. Knowing that kind of cruelty, I would have to be honest.", "He ruined his own marriage by cheating and you are partially at fault for going along with and not telling his wife. Idk how you can even look at yourself in the mirror when you knew what he was doing and said nothing. How can you even be friends with a cruel jerk like him? ESH accept the wife.", "YTA for not telling her you know sooner.\n\nHow can you stay friends with that guy ? \n\nAnd how dare you say he LOVES her ? This is wrong on so many levels and it's all kinds of effed up that you didn't say anything and let her be cheated on for this long.\n\nNot saying anything is the same as approving it.", "NTA, but wow... typically our closest friends align with our values and morals.  From what you have shared, it sounds like you abhor this guy's behavior, but why stay friends with him?\n\nYou are NTA for being honest when confronted.  However, YTA for enabling him.  I don't agree with everyone else that it is your responsibility to tell the wife - things aren't that simple.  But your willingness to go along with his behavior is enabling him.  I know you can't make him stop, but how good a friend (let alone person) is this that ignores his wife and his friend?  This guy clearly has no remorse and it's all a game to him.  Why are you allowing this guy in your life?\n\nAlso, now that the truth is out there, I think there may be some moral obligation to consider in regard to what you share with his wife... she's asked you directly and you know that he's going to gaslight her.  Should you give the woman a fighting chance in life by helping her with the information she needs to move on?", "OP YTA for \"I said \u201cI knew and I\u2019m sorry, but Jack really does love you\u201d. No, Jack doesn't really love his wife. He likes thinking she's dumb. \n\nAnd what do you mean...\"I don\u2019t know all the tactics on cheating and lying..\" What tactics are there to know?", "Nope! Can't blame ' Bro Code ' or anything either. Just a plain shitty thing to do. Her being oblivious does not make it right, just as your not mentioning it, doesn't.

OK maybe your just a skid mark but definitely YTA.", "YTA and I hope you\u2019ve learned some valuable lessons about the people in your life you call \u201cfriend.\u201d Honestly your interjection of \u201cbut he really loves you!\u201d might be the worst part. You obviously don\u2019t know anything about love.", "NTA for saying you knew but YTA for being friends with him.  You didn\u2019t ruin his marriage, he did.", "YTA for not telling her.You let her think your friend loves her whilst he was being a disgusting bastard by cheating on her which you could\u2019ve told her about.Where\u2019s your decency and respect for others,you only cared about your friend even when he was in the wrong which shows your ignorance for acknowledging other people\u2019s feelings and doing the right thing.If your girlfriend was cheating on you and her friend knew would you not want her to tell you and how would you feel if you were Jack\u2019s wife in this situation?\n\nAnd how can you say to her that Jack loves her man? that comes across as very condescending and annoying,I get that you\u2019re trying to stick up for your friend but he clearly doesn\u2019t love her when he was cheating on her with another girl.If this guy is like a brother to you then I am genuinely concerned for you bro and the people you keep within your friendship group because Jack has no respect and is a prick who put you in a uncomfortable situation which no friend should do and he\u2019ll drag you down with him", "You and Jack pick lousy friends.", "NTA wasn't your place to say anything or business, your pals a dick though, he couldn't care who he hurt including his wife or your friendship", "No. YTA for supporting your friend to cheat on his wife blazingly. Why would you keep friends like that? Imagine him having sex in their martial bed as revenge for arguments. Awful.", "ESH Except for that poor wife\n\n\"Jack really does love you\" no he doesn't, and he never did, if he genuinely loved his wife then he wouldn't have had an affair in the first place, don't insult that poor woman by suggesting something so blatantly untrue.\n\nYour friend is a complete asshole for what he's done to her, and I wish him all the worst with his future relationships, he deserves nothing but misery from here on out.\n\nYou are also an asshole, because you knew that this was going on for over a year, and you chose to sit back and watch as your awful friend fucked around behind his wife's back. \n\nYou chose to maintain your friendship with a cheating asshole, rather than telling his wife the moment you found out, you could've spared her from more hurt and now she  knows you're an equally untrustworthy person.", "NTA- well except for not telling her sooner.  You might tell her to get an STD check too.\n\nIt feels like your friend honestly was getting off on telling you about his affair.", "YTA. And honestly, this is why women trust men less and less. Men like you don\u2019t hold your own friends accountable for their actions. Your friend isn\u2019t a friend, he\u2019s an ass and you are too for making a fool of his wife for not telling her.

That will never be wrong.", "YTA for betraying your friend. Who is your friend? Him or her? You basically helped cover it up for the year by not saying anything at first....If your \"Morals\" were of such high standards you would have dumped him as a friend right away. \nYou are not a giid friend, nor do you have the conviction you affect to have after the fact.", "\u201cif I don\u2019t cheat, nothing will make me love my wife more\u201d. <--- please stop being friends with this guy. He seems to be taking lessons from Andrew Tate.\n\nYTA. and you fed her even more lies by saying \" ...but Jack really does love you\"", "YTA\n\nYou deny it to the very end. What kind of friend are you to spill the beans immediately after his wife asked?", "The real ahole things is\n\nYou told the wife whom you cheated on that he loved her", "If this is Grady fuck you, just in case you thought you hid this well, you didn\u2019t. Charlotte uses reddit and sent me this. I didn\u2019t have dried up tears in my eyes, I was full on crying. You knew what jack was doing the whole time and I treated you like family.

Fuck you from the bottom of my heart.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. You ruined his marriage? He is quite delusional.", "You are an asshole. For never telling her to begin with. And no he doesn't love her. You don't do that to the people you love. He is just an asshole with asshole friends. \n\nYTA for many reasons", "YTA for not saying anything to his wife sooner.
