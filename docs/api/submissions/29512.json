We've lived together for the last six months, and everything has been great except for his habit of eating my snacks, particularly the sweets I buy.\n\nI mainly didn't mind it because I don't have a huge sweet tooth like he does and I don't buy them all the time, so a him snagging a few cookies wasn't a big deal.\n\nIt occasionally did annoy me because he would sometimes beat me to eating it, but he apologized for it.\n\n\nHowever, my favorite dessert is cheesecake and I get a particular one from an expensive bakery that I don't get very often due to how pricey it was.  So when I got to buy it Saturday, I was excited and popped it in the fridge for me to eat after work and dinner.\n\nI figured Jacob wouldn't eat it because he knows how much I like it or if he wanted a slice, he'd wait for me to get home and ask me about it.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. When I got home from a job and ate my ready-made meal, I looked into the fridge for the cheesecake only to find more than half of it gone.\n\n\nIt was astonishing how much he ate and I was pissed because I had been waiting all day to eat it. Jacob was in our bedroom playing video games and I walked into with the cheesecake box, asking why the hell he ate more than half of the damn thing without telling me. \n\nIt honestly looked like he ate it with his hands which disgusted me.\n\n\nJacob stuttered that he didn't think I would mind since I don't eat sweets a lot anyways and I usually share with him anyways.\n\nI pointed out that cheesecake is one of my favorite and I technically don't \"share\", he just takes my snacks without asking. This devolved into an argumentive back and fourth which I eventually asked that he pay for a replacement.\n\nJacob refused, saying it was too expensive and I was taking things too far. I persisted, telling him it's not that much of a big deal to replace and I would give him money to do it.\n\nJacob eventually left for his mom's place because I was \" unreasonable\" and \"demanding\" and that he'd talk to me in the morning. Well, it's the next day and it's been radio silence from Jacob.\n\nI asked my friends and some agreed that he should pay for a replacement but others said that it was just cake and I shouldn't demand for him to pay for something I didn't really need.", "created_utc": 1698077951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eoboo/aita_for_asking_that_my_boyfriend_pay_for_a/", "score": 1208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't *need*  to play video games.\n\nNTA, and consider whether you want to remain in a relationship with someone who repeatedly eats your food and then won't replace something you bought for yourself. He then calls you unreasonable and demanding.", "NTA.\n\nIf the cost of a cheesecake is all you lost in learning what sort of person he really is, consider it cheap tuition and move on.\n\nFFS, you even *offered to give him money to go get the replacement cheesecake*.\n\nStop and think about that for a minute or two.", "NTA but I don't think the issue is the cost of the cheesecake but rather how you two share space and food. Basically he's not listening to you and not thinking of you. Then getting defensive when confronted and then running to his mama to throw a temper tantrum for days- which frankly he's way too old to do.   \n\n\nIt would just gross me out if my partner sat down and ate over half a cheesecake all at once, that's like at least 3000 calories, maybe even 5000 depending on toppings and size, etc. Plus like two weeks worth of a healthy daily sugar requirement. Seems like he should feel like total shit after consuming all of that. Sweet addiction is a real thing, so is binge eating. I wonder if part of his defensiveness and immaturity around the issue is that he's suffering from some sort of eating disorder.   \n\n\nYeah, asking for him to replace the cost is fair- he should do that just because cheesecake is very expensive. But I don't think it will solve the problem you two are having.", "You bought it as a treat for yourself.  He decided to eat half of it.\n\nAt the very least, he owes you half the price of the cheesecake.\n\nIf he wants access to all of your food, he can pay for half of your groceries.\n\nAnd he left to stay with his mom?\n\nImmaturity at its finest.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  It's not really about the cake, it's about how he's treating you.  He takes things that you haven't given and expects you to be okay with it.  Probably a good time for an adjustment in this relationship.", "NTA \n\n>I eventually asked that he pay for a replacement ... Jacob refused, saying it was too expensive and I was taking things too far. \n\nThis way of thinking is the worst. It's disgusting. His attitude is the opposite of what it should be. \n\nIf you selfishly eat/use up/damage something of someone else's without asking only to later find out that it was far more expensive/irreplaceable than you thought it would be that is *more* reason to apologize profusely and take responsibility to make things right. \n\nIt is in no way an excuse to refuse all responsibility and even get angry at being asked to because you would have to go to far more expense and trouble than you had imagined (if you had thought at all when being selfish and greedy). Bad luck. It's on your head. The other person, your victim, should not have to suffer.\n\nETA: And if the item is to be considered nothing worth making a fuss about, then paying for it and taking the time to replace it should be considered nothing to make a fuss about either -- after all it had to shopped for and paid for in the first place. It's like for like. If you don't consider the two equivalent you are just saying your own money and time is valuable while that of the person you took from isn't.", "NTA. Him eating what he knew you'd gotten yourself as a special treat was disrespectful and being unwilling to replace it is worse.", "Nta - and the friends who said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, dump them too. Dump Jacob, dump the friends, then you don\u2019t have to share with anyone who doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries.", "NTA - He is being selfish, plain and simple. He\u2019s not a child and at his age should understand how to not take other peoples stuff or to apologise when he has done something wrong. Running to his mammy further proves his immaturity", "NTA. He knew what he was doing. His previous apologies weren't sincere. He will continue to do this because it suits him and he cares more about himself than you.", "You have a relationship problem hahaha he ate half of it doesnt want to pay for it cause its too expensive\n\nHe constantly takes without asking\n\nYou need to look at these red flags", "NTA, yes he should pay, he is always eating or finishing your snacks, does he buy any of his own. He is inconsiderate and he needs to learn about actions and consequences.", "NTA and he is supposed to be 26, and he ran home to his mummy. Pathetic.  The only chink in your story is that you don\u2019t seem to have set the boundary on your snacks before.  Man-children are SO unattractive.", "NTA\n\nIf he dug his hands into your dressert to eat it without asking at all, he should be prepared to pay for it.  None of this is the behavior of a mature adult ready for a committed relationship.", "NTA\n\nHe is an AH for touching your cheesecake and then not paying for it or replacing it.\n\nsounds like you need a fridge lock", "Nta- trash took itself out.  Deep breath. Block and change the locks", "NTA, it\u2019s not about the cheesecake, it\u2019s about a lack of respect and basic empathy. If he doesn\u2019t have the maturity to respect your property or the ability to recognize he hurt you and make amends for it, he\u2019s not ready for a relationship.", "NTA. You really just asked him to pick it up. He didn\u2019t even have to buy it. He threw a tantrum over that?", "NTA\n\nYou are rightfully owed on your cheesecake. He\u2019s throwing this tantrum to manipulate you into thinking that you\u2019re taking things too far which you\u2019re not. I would reconsider this boyfriend especially knowing he gobbled it with his bare hands and cheap to pay you back on principle.", "Dude. He\u2019s 6 years older than you. Like he was an 18 year old young adult when you were 12. And he\u2019s acting like a child. NTA.", "If it\u2019s too expensive he especially shouldn\u2019t have touched it. NTA but he\u2019s got to go.", "NTA.  This isn't about \"just a cake\"; it is about a selfish bf who could buy his own sweets, but instead he steals yours, yes it is stealing, and then claims you are \"unreasonable' and \"demanding\" when you ask that he pay for the cheesecake he stole and ate.\n\nFYI, life will always be this way with him.  Is he worth it?", "Nta\n\n\nHe is disgusting if he ate with his hands. Personally, I would be done. He has no respect for you or your boundaries.  \n\n\nAny friend that agrees is missing the whole point.  \n\nDo you live together?", "His behavior really takes the cake.", "NTA. So it's okay for him to eat it and essentially take it from you but it's too expensive to replace? Selfish much? And he ate it with his hands? WTF - how disgusting. \n\nI would dump a man who was my age acting like this. That he is 6 years older is just another red flag.", "NTA I don't want to use extreme words but he sounds unstable. Or at least immature. Refusing to pay for something he ate?? Refusing to go pick up the food with Your money?? What?? Coupled with how he's dating someone 6 years younger than him? I'm 24 and I can't imagine dating an 18 year old, they're literal children. 26 and 20 is still gross. I'm not insulting you in the slightest, people your age don't realize how gross that is. I fell victim to the same thing when I was 19.", "NTA. He needs to replace it with his own money.", "NTA, but you giving him money to replace it is not him replacing it.\n\nIt sounds like this is an ongoing issue, and it's about respect (or lack thereof). He does not respect you enough to respect your money or your things.", "NTA. If it's 'just cake', then he shouldn't have a problem replacing it. The idea that someone can look in a fridge and see something they know their partner likes, that they didn't buy, and they go full hog on it and then have the gall to blame you for being upset about it? That kind of speaks to a selfish immaturity that I don't think he's going to grow out of. To be fair, you've enabled his behavior by letting him get away with it when it didn't matter to you that much. But now it matters and you're putting your foot down a little too late.\n\nStill, I'd tell him to stay gone until he can figure out where he fucked up and how to fix it. And maybe stop letting him get away with this shit.", "Nta, he takes you for granted in general and when confronted,  avoids accountability. We all get a little lazy,  get a little too used to nice things others let us get away with.  When is pointed out,  healthy people can admit fault,  apologize,  and make amends. \n\nApologizing and replacing is the absolute minimum to make amends.\n\nHe acted wrong.\n\nBut you're willing to forgive,  so,  all he has to do is the minimum. \n\nIf he won't,  that's his decision.", "NTA, and maybe think about getting rid of him. He clearly does not respect you or your boundaries. An apology without change is just manipulation. Radio silence after pouting at his mama's is ridiculous and petty.", "NTA\n\nThis is almost the exact same situation as my bf and I, I buy snacks and sweets when I have a sweet tooth but I don't eat all of it or I eat very little and he \"cleans up\" after me.  But he always asks if he can have some if I bought it.\n\nI also make a point of letting him know when there's something I've bought that I specifically want for myself and he knows to choose other snacks.\n\nBut if I bought something and he finished it off without me knowing but I actually wanted more he absolutely wouldn't hesitate to replace it, even moreso if it was expensive!", "NTA if you can buy a mini fridge that locks and put your snacks in there.", "NTA - he says it's not a big deal.. But that it is too expensive to replace, which seems like a big deal..", "So he ate your favorite food (maybe with his hands? was he playing video games with dried cheesecake on his hands?). Refused to make it right. Ran off to his momma's house. NTA.", "This touching", "NTA. I hope the radio silence continues and the snack monster never burdens you with his munching ever again!", "NTA.   \n\n\nMy wife and I have totally different snack-eating habits - II like savoury, she likes sweet, and we eat snacks at a different rate, so - we have two snack containers.\n\nShe never takes from my snack container. I occasionally take a sweet from hers, but I ask first because they were bought for her.\n\nExpensive cheesecake in the fridge is an obvious ask-first treat, not a \"jump in and eat more than half without asking\" treat, and obviously he should replace it.", "NTA.  If it is too expensive that just reinforces his guilt.", "NTA - He is inconsiderate and disrespectful.", "It's too expensive for him to buy but not too expensive for you to buy so he can steal it... nta", "NTA\n\nThis is a red flag for me. He knows the cheesecake is expensive, and that she doesn\u2019t eat sweets often, but he sees an expensive sweet in the fridge and decides to eat, most of it. that feels slightly intentional. \n\nOnce aware that she\u2019s angry about it when she asked for a replacement, he balks at doing so, and says he won\u2019t because it\u2019s expensive but not expensive enough for you to eat.\n\nThis tells me one that he has be told things explicitly like don\u2019t eat the brownies I just made and then there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll eat some of the brownies anyway but also he can\u2019t take responsibility or make amends.\n\nalso, it doesn\u2019t seem like he knows that cheesecake is her favorite which tells me he doesn\u2019t actually listen.", "NTA.\n\nI hope there were conversations between you and your family when you at 18 first started dating a 24 year old. Did you know your boyfriend before you turned 18?\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the age because it sounds like you and your boyfriend clicked because you two had similar interests and goals when you were a teenager.\n\nYou are getting older and wanting this to evolve into more mature relationship. He wants to play video games and run to mommy after eating cheesecake like a raccoon.\n\nTake this time apart to think if this is really the type of relationship you not only want but also deserve.\n\nMy opinion? The trash panda took itself out.", "NTA and other than his disregard for respecting what's yours, this stood out to me really - \n\n>Jacob refused, saying it was too expensive and I was taking things too far.\n\nHe knows this cheesecake is expensive and he'd not spend money on it himself. He knows you buy it as a special treat. He went ahead and helped himself to it without asking and when you rightly got angry, it's too expensive for him to replace. But he doesn't give a single damn about it being expensive for YOU who spent the money. He is telling you loud and clear how the relationship is - his money is his money and your money is his to waste too.\n\nHe went to his mother's house and is giving you the silent treatment over DESSERT and he is clearly in the wrong. \n\nHow will he act in more serious situations? \n\nHe is not mature enough to be in an adult relationship.", "NTA he owes you a cheesecake. \n\nWhen did the new generation become such cowards? Running home to mommy over a cheesecake!", "YTA to yourself. Change the locks and be done. The disrespect and gaslighting will only get worse. Wake the fuck up.", "NTA But theres 2 ways of going about having food in the house with multiple people. Everyones buying/pitching in, it gets divided equally. The other is everyone buying for themselves and it is not shared, meaning you only eat the food you bought. \n\n It sounds like on at least the sweets you are the latter? Have 1 last convo about it calmly and decide together how you will be handling it from now on. If he then can't do it, you got a problem. \n\n It's a respect thing at that point and I would not be willing too compromise or date someone like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
