I've drive my dog there everyday. This is the fifth time a big dog is in the small dog side.

She makes a mocking face and me like a damn kid and I tell her to leave then her boyfriend starts barking cussing at  me and we get into a shouting match but I refused to back down as I felt I was in the right. Threats were made but I am so fed up with seeing this I wasn't backing down. They finally left. \n\nI probably didn't handle this as well as I could but I'm sick of this.

If your dog can\u2019t be at the park due to being aggressive it shouldn\u2019t be there. Especially in the wrong side", "NTA.  Reactive dogs should not be at the dog park AT ALL. It\u2019s an area for dogs to play safely. Ignore the trolls OP.", "NTA.  It's a small dog park and they need to go.", "NTA - The city/county has created two sides to the dog park for a reason. Big dogs shouldn't be in the small side if a small dog is using it and small dogs shouldn't be on the big dog side if a big dog is there. You weren't asking them to leave a regular, all-dog park so your dog had exclusive run of the place.", "Funny, I've never been to a dog park with a \"my dog is an aggressive untrained asshole\" section. \ud83d\ude44 The people with the big dog should have started packing it in as soon as they saw someone with a small dog coming. The OPs not an asshole for expecting to be able to use the section of the park specifically reserved for their size dog, and while the other owners aren't the assholes for using it until a small dog showed up, they crossed the line over to asshole when they didn't immediately remove themselves when someone with more right to the space (by the park rules) showed up. NTA", "NTA.  Everyone who pays taxes pays for both a big and small area.  People aren't entitled to just use either/or as they feel like it.  I'm sure the country actually has rules about it.  The dog needs to be trained.  That's the responsibility of the owners, and they don't have to pay someone else to do it.  They can do it themselves.  Just be careful that the dog isn't used against you.  And fuck those three people.", "NTA - They were breaking the rules because their dog is too aggressive. Based on their owners reaction, I wonder how that happened (/s)?", "Ur totally NTA here. Smaller doggo rights matter too. Big dogs need to go in their own park shaking my smh.", "NTA  I had to stop taking my dogs to the dog park because there were so many irresponsible people there who refused to control or clean up after their badly behaved dogs.  And more often than not, the owners of those dogs were also really badly behaved.  Sadly, in this case, being right (and you are) doesn't matter as much as being safe.  Do what you need to do to keep your sweet little pup safe.", "NTA. Those are the idiots with big troublesome dogs. The small dog park is intended for people with\u2026small dogs.  And some dogs just ain\u2019t dog park material.  My last rottie loved his park pack, he brought the party to the park.

Big dogs go on the big dog side and small dogs go on the small dog side. The argument about not being able to afford training is bullshit. I\u2019ve had many dogs and never had to send them to a trainer. That dog obviously behaves just like it\u2019s asshole owners.", "NTA.  They have no business taking an aggressive dog to the dog park.

Good for you that you drive your dog to a dog park daily \ud83d\ude44 there is also this thing called walking your dog. I\u2019m going to guess your car smells like a dirty kennel, people like you usually let their dogs roam free in their car while they DRIVE them to get their exercise lol. YTA.", "YTA. It is a public area that can be used by anyone for their dogs. Therefore, you don't have any right to tell anyone where they can and can't go.

OP, if you can't afford dog training, you don't get a dog. We made sure we had a certain amount in savings before getting cats. So far, every time we've lost a cat it's been about $1500, so we keep that in mind.\n\nNo one forces you to own a pet. It's a choice. You have to be a responsible pet owner.", "Usually it's even in the rules that you can't have a reactive dog at the dog park at all. I also see big dogs in the small dog park by me and it usually just makes all the people with little dogs leave because people don't like conflict.", ">However, you stated that no other dogs were in the little park. So what is it for them to sit in there for 45 minutes without bothering anyone?\n\nThey weren't 'bothering anyone' until somebody with a small dog wanted to justifiably use the small dog park for a small dog. The people with the large dog wanted to have *exclusive access* to the small dog park, denying it to all owners of small dogs, who would be able to share the small dog park with other small dogs.\n\nUnless you own the park, you should not be able to block other people from using the facilities. That's what the owners of the large dog were doing, because while that dog was there, nobody else could *share* the park with them."]}
