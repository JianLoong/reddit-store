I never once brought up anything about her being an alcoholic, nor did I lecture her. I was just checking on her. That's it.\n\nBut there were many other times we did attempt to get her help.

She has a deadly disease that can and will kill her eventually. She needs real, long-term help.  \n\nSource: I am an alcoholic in recovery", "NAH.\n\nYou are doing your part here by being the non-judgmental family member who your sister can still talk to.  Sounds like your sister already has plenty of relatives that tell her what to do.\n\nEverybody dies.  Usually when someone says \"If they die, they die\" it's because someone has been trying to protect a person who doesn't want to be protected.  As in this case. Your sentiment is well understood, but your mom is not AH for trying, or for worrying, or for trying to get you to help.\n\nYes, your words were a little abrupt and sound a bit heartless, but telling the truth is rarely an AH thing to do.", "NTA though you might have been a bit more tactful.  It's really difficult for a mother to hear one of her children say something like this about one of her other children...no matter the circumstances.\n\nYou are, though, fully within your right to cut off support.

I thought it was a threat. Like \"if my sister dies, *she* dies\".  Good thing I read the post :)\n\nNTA - you're very much correct. She's an adult and isn't obligated to listen to anyone, which means that at some point, it's time to give up trying to change someone because they're firmly in charge of their destiny. Your mother may not like that, but it's the truth. Your sister seems hellbent on death by alcohol and is rejecting help. Fantastic for her if she can fix it on her own, but if she can't and she continues? That was her choice.", "NTA - yeah your sister's decided to commit suicide by alcohol, I have a brother doing the same thing.

And of course your sister shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you.\n\nHopefully while mom is being distant with you she\u2019s working out options for housing/treatment for your sister, or how to keep her alive if she ends up homeless and addicted to other things.", "YTA there were more tactful ways to say this. \u201cIn the end, she\u2019s her own person and will make her own decisions.\u201d \u201cWe can offer her as much support as we can but in the end, it\u2019s her choice to get help.\u201d", "NAH.

Trying to pull someone out of a blackhole can end up with you getting dragged in.  Worth adding though that \"that grown woman should be solving her own problems\" doesn't really work when it comes to that kind of addiction.\n\nHowever, for the interaction between you and your mum, ESH.\n\nYour sister's alcoholism is clearly a big stress for all of you, so it's understandable that you both are more likely to respond in negative ways.  It's not good though and you both should keep an eye out on not letting your sister's situation be an weight dragging down the relationship with your mum.\n\nProbably worth you and your mum having a proper sit down chat away from your sister.  Just tell her you need to step away from it all.  There comes a point where trying to help someone like that starts to effect your own wellbeing in a big way, in fact, given the argument you and your mum are having, that's already happened.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t need to say everything you think out loud. \n\nEspecially to your mother, who might feel responsible for your sister in a way you don\u2019t, because she is her child", "NAH- I think you both said things in the heat of anger frustration and fear, neither of you can live or fix your sister's life and your mother cannot expect you to care and do for your sister like she does, thats her child not yours.  In time you both might start talking again but you need to make sure you don't get to a point where you are right now.  Your mental health and wellbeing are valid and important and if staying NC with both mom and siblings is what you need then it's what you need.", "NAH.

It is not easy to hear one of your kids be so uncaring toward the other and your mom isn't ready or able yet to give up on your sister. Saying \"if she dies, she dies\" was unnecessary. \n\nMy grandma dealt with my Uncle's substance abuse for 20+ years. She had to lay down boundaries that felt harsh but she never stopped caring for his well being and hoping that some day something would click.

A mother\u2019s love and worry for their children doesn\u2019t stop, no matter what age they are. Do try and be gentle with her and yourself.

That\u2019s okay and perfectly relatable. Addictions are _hard_ on families. There\u2019s a very real chance your sister may not survive her addiction and that is really upsetting to everyone involved. You may need space from her addiction. That\u2019s okay.

NTA for setting boundaries and being on the tough love side of things.", "I know what you\u2019re going through. And although I know all of those feelings, you unfortunately and unfairly took those out on your mom instead of your sister. Loving an addict often feels hopeless. You feel used, abused, scared, betrayed, confused, and a plethora of other emotions. But mainly it feels hopeless. Like nothing you do or say or feel will ever make them change, and all you can do is sit back and watch as they destroy themselves. And you come to a point where watching them destroy themselves hurts too much, and so in an act of self preservation, you start to turn your back on them. \n\nIt seems like you\u2019ve hit that point, but your mom hasn\u2019t, and likely never will. And on top of all of the things people who love addicts feel, your mom probably also feels like this is somehow her fault\u2026because she\u2019s her mom.
