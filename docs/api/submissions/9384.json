Your mom seems to have dived in, while you seem to be distancing yourself. Neither is a wrong response, necessarily. \n\nIt's hard to love addicts. It's hard to know what the right response is - will they respond better to support or hard truths? \n\nDo what is best for you, support your mom with boundaries around your sister. You cannot save her if she doesn't want to save herself (mom and sister equally apply here.)\n\nNTA but really think on how far your support will go. Best of luck to all three of you. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Alcoholism is cruel, but you can\u2019t help someone who isn\u2019t ready or willing to help themselves. However, your mom isn\u2019t either. I get enabling is a serious issue and you\u2019re also at your wit\u2019s end but that\u2019s her daughter. Her baby. And she\u2019s already watching her destroy herself. Give your mom a hug. She needs it.", "NTA. You can\u2019t make someone change, they have to want to change. My brother is an alcoholic and my mom is to the point she wishes he would. She just prays he doesn\u2019t take an innocent person with him by driving drunk", "NAH, just a group of very sad people who are dealing with the fact that they can't help someone who does not want to be helped.", "NTA.", "NTA. Former addict here, and you are allowed to reach wit's end with people. You are not required to keep getting burned by your sister, especially after you've tried your best to help her. Now, could it have been phrased better? Yeah, probably. The phrasing was a bit harsh, BUT, when we're emotional we don't think about that. I understand the frustration of \"I can't keep watching this person slowly killing themselves\", and it's okay to feel that way.  \n\nFrom your mom's side? What she said is messed up. However, I can kind of understand why she reacted the way she did. That's her child, and that's a completely different type of relationship to have with someone than being sisters. It was a harsh truth that you spoke, and I think it may have hit her that she may have to bury her child, something every parent fears. I don't think you need to apologize for the sentiment, but it may be worth reaching out and saying \"Mom, I understand that what I said hurt you, and I'm sorry I said it so harshly, but I can't keep being a part of this. I don't want our relationship to suffer, but if you want to repair things between us, I need an apology for the cold, callous thing you said to me.\"  \n\nShe's hurting, and as I said, when we're emotional, we don't think rationally. She lashed out at a hard look at her possible future if your sister doesn't shape up. I'm not saying you have to forgive her, just try to look at it from the point of view of a parent watching their child die in front of their eyes. No parent expects to outlive their child. I watched it destroy 2 of my aunts, and it's the worst thing that can happen to someone who has a child.  \n\nYou didn't deserve what she said, and neither of you deserve what your sister is putting you through. You are within rights to walk away from your sister, but try to extend your mother some grace. I think you may have just made her fully realize that yes, this will end your sister's life if she doesn't get better, and your mom is helpless to do anything about it. So just try to talk about it with her in more even terms, if this is something you want to repair. (And if she's otherwise been a good mother, definitely try to talk it out with her.)  \n\nI wish you and your family the best, and that your sister wakes up and sees the damage she's causing, and I also hope that you're able to find peace between your mom and yourself. You have my deepest sympathies on this.", "NTA.  This is why people have to hit rock bottom.  They have to decide to live or die on their own.  Your mother is an enabler, and she has no right saying that about you.", "NTA. Your frustration is understandable but I understand why your mom might be upset about you saying what you said as well. It's her daughter and she's obviously not ready to call it quits yet, even though you might be. I hope you can somehow reach your sister and help her before it's too late.", "NTA Grew up surrounded by addicts, still have them in my family. You can't do anything if they don't want to do it.\nYou are not responsible to carry your sister's burden for her.", "NTA Your sister has a terminal illness. It doesn't need to be terminal, but if she's choosing to forgo treatment, then that's what it is. I have a loved one with depression and a history of suicidal ideation and a couple of attempts. They are spotty about taking meds, often talking about taking St. John's Wort or whatever homeopathic thing, and it all leads to the same cycle. And so for my own peace, I've accepted that their treatable condition may well be terminal. But! Be gentle with your mother. Her child is killing herself and she can't do anything about it. Assuming she hasn't been a shitty mom in the past, try to be there for each other. This isn't going to get any easier for any of you anytime soon.", "NTA and ur mom can't see that ur sister doesn't give a fuck", "It looks like I may be in the minority here but NTA. \n\nIn my opinion, a gift with strings attached is not a gift worth receiving. There are so few times in life we can have it 100% our way and your wedding day should absolutely be one. If you didn\u2019t care about the invitation language but it was special to them, I could easily see opting to include their names as a special thanks. But this is something you and your partner discussed and came to a conclusion to protect their feelings\u2014it\u2019s not a little thing. Hope the wedding goes well for all parties, best of luck!", "> This isn't her fault\n\nMaybe.", "I'm so glad to hear you made it through. I lost my brother to meth last year and after it happened I told my mom that \"This was honestly the way it was always going to end\". The difference is that she agreed with me. I'm thankful, in a way, he went out riding his motorcycle and not OD'd somewhere all alone. But we had been preparing to lose him for a while. Still hurts though. \n\n\nDidn't mean to emotionally dump on you, just missing him tonight I guess lol. I wish you so many clear and happy years ahead of you!", "Al Anon is Intro to Scientology, don\u2019t push that shit on people. \n\nI recommend SMART Recovery. \n\nhttps://www.smartrecovery.org/about-us/", "Pssst! I know of some secular online meetings, PM me if you want the details.", "There\u2019s this program called SMART recovery that\u2019s alright. They have a family meeting too, idk how it is for the people with addictions meetings but I\u2019ve done virtual family members ones that are helpful. There\u2019s not so many real life in person meetings because it\u2019s less popular but I also can\u2019t handle all the religion crap from Alanon or ACOA and SMART isn\u2019t religious.", "Yep Al Anon was bullshit, I left even more angry then when I got there. It was all religious based. I needed coping skills for me and my kids not their cult like religious bullshit.", "AlAnon was also founded by a Scientologist esque group. They are just another grifter.", "Al Anon isn\u2019t AA. It\u2019s a group for the families of addicts to help them learn how to deal with their family member. How to support but not enable, how to say \u201cno\u201d, how to avoid catastrophic forward thinking, how to let go of the control you try to take of the person who clearly is unable to control their own life. \n\nAl Anon saved my dad\u2019s life when we learned my sister was on heroin. I honestly didn\u2019t think either of them would survive the summer. And when she ultimately did have a fatal OD, he survived that too. \n\nI will shout the accolades of Al Anon to anybody who will listen, and recommend it to *any* family member of an addict.", "When any stumble is treated as a fall, you take away an addict's will to continue fighting. \n\nAn alcoholic who has one bad night is just that. A person who had a bad night. The way AlAnon treats things, that person needs to start from scratch. If anyone here has had to start something from scratch, they know how big of a demotivator it is.", "[deleted]", "Trees can't cure addiction so it is meaningless to give yourself over to trees. It's gibberish. It just proves the point that AA is useless and you can do without it. Because it's not offering you anything real. Just trees.", "Exactly", "if it's working for you it works for you, but the plural of anecdote isn't data and it's been shown that it doesn't work for most.\n\nif you take that as an attack on you then you need to engage in some introspection.", "Yeah.... like I'm christian but ppl in NA/AA often become over the top.....\"Jesus freaks\" \n\nThe problem with addiction is it's a mental illness of overindulgence. It can be anything, drugs, alcohol, sex, caffeine, work, gambling. Often when addicts kick one habbit they pick up another. \nThey're trying to fill some sort of deep void within themselves but they're just making it worse. It's like being thirsty out at sea and you keep drinking saltwater.", "coffee and cigarettes", "Solution to that quandary would be to stop finding yourself in court for a reason where being ordered to observe a meeting would be an option. Or just say \u2018nope, I\u2019d rather go to jail\u2019. It is a myth that 12 step meetings are the only way for everyone, the truth is it\u2019s the only way for me\u2026. Bc all the other stuff I tried first didn\u2019t work. For me. And that\u2019s the only person I can speak of. Anyone that says it\u2019s the only way for EVERYONE- well that\u2019s not a very true statement. It might be the only way for them. In my experience the court only orders you to attend meetings, not be involved, not join, not go back after you\u2019ve fulfilled the obligation. And if you chose to be part of a program that requires a long term attendance- that\u2019s your decision. Surely the court will allow you to be incarcerated if you chose not to be involved. Everyone has a choice what to do. Just bc you don\u2019t like the options- doesn\u2019t mean they are wrong.", "exactly", "What solution do you suggest to the struggling addict sipping saltwater at sea?", "8 years ago isn't that old. It's not like AA has radically changed their approach in the last 8 years.", "No, the solution would be to have judges stop violating the establishment clause and instead of requiring people go to patently non-scientific religious treatment programs to have them go to actually science based ones.", "Honestly the answer is different for everyone. It's not a one size fits all issue. \n\nSome people AA/NA works for them, great! But some people it doesn't and they shouldn't be made to feel that there are no other options than a 12 step. One of my best friend's tried & tried but he felt he ran out of options. He is no longer with us....RIP...\n\nI would suggest therapy, change of environment, and a positive support system would be a great place to start looking. I had an addiction to \"bad\" people. I always wanted to help them and often it dragged me down. I was so caught up in what was going on I didn't see what was really happening....the bigger picture. I moved to the country side. It was peaceful, I got to clear my head, emotionally heal, and more.\nI found my LAND so I could stop drinking my SALTWATER. \n\nI did eventually return back to civilization but I'm Ok. However when life's circumstances align I will be going back to the countryside with my family.", "The belief that data is everything is cult-like in itself. Do studies cover every important factor that go into alcoholism? Nope. They can't. Literally can't. \n\nWhen you rely on dAtA, human beings are removed from their whole circumstances and only some factors are taken into account. \n\nIf learning statistics has taught me anything, it's to be extremely careful about how data is collected and how it's analyzed and interpreted. \n\nSo, data is not everything. \n\nPersonal experiences DO matter. And rejecting that is blindness and a willful ignorance that many people are willing to carry out as long as they can suck on the security that data can be manipulated to display."]}
