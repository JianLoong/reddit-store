I get coming to terms with reality and just being fed up at times- i have lived on roller coasters with relatives- IT sucks- \n\nI tried to help a cousin get her life straightened out and she put it off. She drank, did drugs and had abusive boyfriends. Two months before she was supposed to move in. One of her abusive bfs - beat the crap out of her and now she has permanent brain damage.

She is 34 and literally thinks she 50. Her life is over at 34. She will never have a life- never get  married or have kids - it kills me\n\nThere was nothing I could do and i feel sick about it - i bet your mom feels the same- youve gotta give her time to process and you didn\u2019t- thats why your arguing- its what she has control over\n\nI hope this helps- I get that your preparing yourself for whats to come- no matter what you do - it will still hurt when it arrives \n\nI wish you the best- make up with your mom so you two will have eachother when it does", "NTA, but from the title I thought you were threatening your mother. \n\nOnce I understood - yes, unfortunately, that\u2019s the only rational attitude.", "NAH. You\u2019re all being put through something terrible. Including your sister. Addiction effects everyone and can cause a lot of damage.

She\u2019s gonna keep drinking herself to death . And that\u2019s the sad truth. I would just hope that she gets arrested honestly so she can detox in jail.

It\u2019s not a cry for help, as the first time she did it she got a lot of attention and the doctor presumed she was asleep when telling my mum how much she would have to take to do damage, how much to take to class as an overdose without doing damage. She listened and took mental notes.\n\nThese days she takes enough to class it as an overdose but she doesn\u2019t need a stomach pump, just sleep it off. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. My mum is exhausted. She\u2019s so worn and tired and everyone sees it except my sister. My mum keeps joking about unaliving herself because of the stress my sister puts on her. My sister messages random Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d saying she\u2019s overdosed and her family won\u2019t do anything, leading to a lot of abuse from complete strangers. She\u2019ll be messaging this to people whilst on the phone to my mum.\n\nAfter 16 years of this, as her sister, I am done. I\u2019ve tried everything.

It\u2019s not that hard to have this, unless in this situation there are traumas and toxicities we do not know about. \n\nI hope things work out for OP and her sister/mom. They need each other but sister also has to get humble about where she\u2019s at: near the last stop on the bus. Choosing alcohol over family and friends doesn\u2019t always come with berating/mistreating such people. When it does - wow - I get worried.
