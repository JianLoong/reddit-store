To sum it up, he was my only boyfriend in high school. To this day he\u2019s the only man I\u2019ve ever even kissed. We were responsible, or so I thought. When I was 17 I got pregnant. I went through with it.\n\nWell a few years later, when we were 20, we were doing really good and I wanted another baby, so we tried to get pregnant again. And I did, but unfortunately, I miscarried. I didn\u2019t want another baby for some time after that, but we eventually gave birth to two other kiddos.\n\nWe are 26 now. Kids are 9, 4, and 2. When we bought our house, I wanted to do something to show off our beautiful babies, so I got nice pictures of them and I got them all framed, but for our unborn child, I obviously didn\u2019t have a picture for them, so I had them frame a picture of the ultrasound and put it next to the other kids. I left some extra space because I want more kids. I want one more, maybe even 2 more.\n\nToday my sister said I should take down the ultrasound. I asked why and she said it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d baby and it throws off the space in between each picture. I said I want another baby one day so I\u2019ll put their picture on the other side, and she said \u201coh then just replace the \u2018real\u2019 baby with that one and move them around.\u201d\n\nI told her my unborn baby WAS real, and I\u2019m not taking that down. She said \u201coh, where are they? I\u2019d love to meet them.\u201d\n\nI got so freaking mad I told her to get the hell out of my house and never come back and she said \u201cyou are coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs\u201d and left.\n\nShe told my parents and they said it was super rude of me to kick her out that we could have just agreed to disagree.", "created_utc": 1683496004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b3z7s/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_of_my_house_for/", "score": 1031, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your whole family are AH though. \n\nWe all grieve differently. My sister was stillborn at 19 weeks and we still celebrate her birthday and she's an adult now. I also know people with losses who prefer not to grieve. I'm one of them. I had a miscarriage and for me personally I didn't feel connected to that pregnancy as a child. But I know people who were deeply affected and count that in their number of children.\n\nTbh to me having an ultrasound pic is not weird at all, but leaving blank spaces for a pre chosen number of kids is weird AF to me lol.", "Oof. NTA and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nYour unborn baby was real, and however you want to remember them is completely up to you. Screw people who have no empathy or understanding. It\u2019s healthy to acknowledge them and grieve their loss. \n\nI thought I miscarried my son at 8 weeks and I was devastated, it was a traumatic experience but since it was during Covid they told me not to come in unless the bleeding didn\u2019t stop. Well it slowed, and eventually did, so they scheduled me a check up for 4 weeks later. At the check up they found a 12 week baby perfectly healthy and no explanation for the crime scene that happened a month prior. To say I had anxiety for the remainder of my pregnancy, and PPA after is an understatement. I felt I had cheated the universe and he would be taken from me. \n\nAfter that experience I have immense sympathy for women who lose a pregnancy- I experienced it without truly experiencing it because I got a miracle. Most women carry that loss with them forever and I can\u2019t imagine the longevity of that pain. So I will always be in the corner of do what you need to do to cope with that. Your way is a beautiful and brave way to do it, and your post made me irrationally angry for you. \n\nNot that it excuses her behavior- but is it possible your sister miscarried or had an abortion and didn\u2019t tell anyone? Seeing that may have triggered her meanness as she hasn\u2019t fully dealt with her own feelings. My own sister was not there for me when I thought I lost my son, she\u2019d decided not to go through with a pregnancy years before and still hasn\u2019t fully worked through it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So far from it. And I\u2019d like to add that your kids are so lucky to have you for precisely this. My parents had a brother when I was 3 but he was born very premature and died before he was a year old. I knew this growing up. It was never kept secret or anything. And yet, it was also never really acknowledged. No pictures or anything like that. The cemetery where he was buried was only a few blocks from our house. Though we didn\u2019t avoid it, we never went regularly or anything. I think I went there more often on my own when I was young than I did with my parents. So while there is this part of my family, it\u2019s always felt like it\u2019s also been ignored and separated. What I\u2019m trying to get at is that the picture will send a really powerful and important message to your kids about love and grief and family as they get older. It\u2019s so important for kids to know that big feelings are ok. And that we can be sad and proud of our family at the same time. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.
