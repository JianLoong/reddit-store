(FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN\u2019T KNOW - weed is illegal over here)\n\nA young man in his twenties and his girlfriend were smoking two blunts right in the staircase and they had their 2 bully breed dogs (I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s panicking like someone mentioned, I\u2019m just stating what the dogs are lol) with them just standing there. No, they DID NOT have the dogs on a leash at all.\n\nAt first I asked if they can move for a moment so I can go downstairs, but the girlfriend just went \u201cthey won\u2019t hurt you\u201d without even looking at me. I said I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true but I still don\u2019t really want to get near them. She went \u201cjust go stop worrying\u201d.\n\nI asked twice nicely for them to move for just a moment, so obviously I got pissed. I put on a more stern voice and said \u201cboth of you take your fucking dogs and move\u201d. Finally they looked at me, but they started getting aggressive and her boyfriend was clearly gonna try and start fighting.\n\nI ended up going back inside my house as they wouldn\u2019t move and were going to start a fight, but I was really angered by what happened. I ended up calling the police and reporting 2 people smoking drugs in the block.\n\nThe last thing I witnessed was the police pulling up, and before the police even got to ask a question both of them started getting angry. They ended up getting handcuffed and put in police cars, but I don\u2019t know what happened after that. All I know is they didn\u2019t get put in prison because I saw him this morning.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I should have \u201cmaned up\u201d and just walked down and thinks I was in the wrong. AITA? or was I reasonable? Also if you think I am the AH please give me advice on what a better thing I could have done was as it would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nTLDR : 2 of my neighbours were standing in the stairs of our block smoking pot their 2 bully dogs standing there. When I asked nicely, they refused to move, so I was a bit more stern & told them to fucking move, to which they just tried to fight. I ended up calling the police on them for smoking drugs & they got put in handcuffs. My gf thinks it was my fault.\n\nExtra details : There\u2019s only 1 way down this block which are the stairs I wanted to take, there\u2019s no lift or any other stairs unfortunately. Only 1 way down and up (the estate and buildings round here were built at the start of the 1900\u2019s). Also, these 2 have been seen smoking weed countless times which I have never had a problem with until this. I also want to make it clear, I don\u2019t have a problem with the breed of dog they want, I\u2019m just not a dog person in general.", "created_utc": 1697233742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1779pkj/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_neighbours_who/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just one invented for the purposes of pearl-clutching.\n\nDogs are dogs are dogs.", "\n\nEdit - \n\nOP states the dogs were not on a leash which changed my judgement to NTAH for not wanting to pass the dogs.\n\nIf this was the only reason he called the police then a firm NTAH\n\nHowever OP also states that he has seen them smoking weed multiple times and never had a problem with it until now. \n\nIf he called the cops and mentioned the weed, not just the dogs then I would say NTAH for not passing them and getting mad but YTAH for calling the cops and mentioning the weed when you otherwise didn't have a problem with it.\n\nMy original comment\n\nYTAH\n\nI'm judging based on the situation and how it escalated based on your post. I'm not basing this on the dogs themselves or the drugs. My judgement is purely based on who escalated the situation.\n\nUntil stated otherwise I'm going to assume the dogs were on a leash since you didn't say they weren't.\n\nYou may have a problem with dog breeds and weed but most people don't. Calling the cops on them because you didn't just walk by is ridiculous. \n\nAlso and the main reason you're the asshole is this statement.\n\n>I put on a more stern voice and said \u201cboth of you take your fucking dogs and move\u201d.\n\nUmm yeah up until that point the situation was calm. You're the one who started getting angry. You then expressed that anger in what I don't for one second believe was simply a \"stern\" voice and cussed them out demanding they follow your orders. Honestly even I would look at you sideways if you pulled that with me.\n\nIf you're going to step up you better be ready to put up. Running away from something you started then calling the cops was petty and vindictive. \n\nMy 2 cents...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
