I am now a single father to our 3 kids (11, 8, & 5).  It has been incredibly difficult providing for them by myself, but they've never wanted for anything a day in their life.  Thanks to therapy and a good support system, they are happy, healthy, and thriving.  \n\nIn my wife's culture, it is customary for children to take care of their parents in their old age.  Her parents very much expected this of her.  This was something my wife talked to me extensively about before and during our marriage.  Actually, it was something we fought about a lot because I felt that our focus should be on our kids and doing everything we could to give them a good life.  My wife wanted to house her parents in our home but I disagreed for multiple reasons such as cost and lack of living space.  We eventually agreed to help them pay for a condo or other living arrangements, but not house them.  Sadly, we never got a chance to figure out exactly how that would work.  \n\nHer parents, her mom specifically, took my wife's death hard and fell into depression.  She pretty much became a recluse and neither her nor my FIL have been very involved in our lives since my wife's death.  \n\nHowever, my FIL recently retired and reached out to me about honoring my wife's promise to help take care of them in their old age.  I flat out told him that I cannot honor that promise.  He got upset and told me that this was something that his daughter had promised him and his wife and as her husband, it is now my responsibility to keep that promise.  I told him that I have 3 kids to provide for and I do not have the time, energy, or money to provide for 2 more people.  He told me I was disgracing my wife's honor and memory and that he knew it was a mistake for her to marry outside of her culture.  \n\nHe called me again a few days later and tried to apologize for what he said.  He told me that he acted irrationally and that he's sure we can work something out that will be beneficial for everyone.  I asked him what he meant by that and he said that he and his wife could come live with us so that I have help with the kids and I can still honor my wife's promise to her parents.  I again flat out told him no.  I told him that I've managed fine the past 3 years without their help and I'll continue to do fine.  I told him his proposal is only beneficial to them, not to me in any way.  \n\nHe again tried to tell me that I need to do this to honor his daughter's memory as this was something that she promised to him and his wife.  I told him that sadly, that promise died with his daughter.  He said something to me in his native language that I'm assuming from his tone was not a compliment and hung up on me.  \n\nThey have been minimally involved in our lives since my wife passed away.  Their needs are so far down my priority list.  But I'm torn because I hate feeling like I'm letting my wife down in any way, even if she's not here anymore.", "created_utc": 1678228665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ldurk/aita_for_not_keeping_my_wifes_promise_to_take/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My late husband\u2019s mother is a single older woman with two living daughters. However, she believed my husband and I would build a tiny home on our land for her and care for her and support her in her old age. We have an elementary aged child. I was never on board with this plan and neither was my husband, but he did ask me to look out for his mom after he died (he got sick so we had time to talk through all this). By look out for, he meant stay in her life, check on her, and be there in the event of an emergency. After my husband died, his mother went absolutely feral on me, making heinous accusations, blaming me for \u201cstealing\u201d her son from her, and promising me that she would never forgive me for being the one her son loved more than her. It\u2019s been almost 4 months since he died, and I have cut her from my life. I feel guilty sometimes, but I am a widow in my early 30s with a child to provide for. I cannot sacrifice my peace or my time with my child to care for a fully grown adult who failed to plan for her own future and who has been an absolute monster to me (far beyond the pale of grief). \n\nAll this to say, as someone in a similar situation, your priorities are your child and yourself. You matter. Your needs matter. You are categorically NTA. They abandoned their daughter\u2019s children for three years. They\u2019ve only resurfaced because they want something from you. Truly, you\u2019re NTA. Don\u2019t feel bad for one more second. Care for yourself and your family. I wish you all the best. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Odd that he didn't take this up with you until after he made the choice to retire and stop supporting himself. Apparently it also didn't occur to him that you had only one income rather than the two you might have had to try to take care of more than just your immediate family.", "NTA You cannot create money, time, or resources out of thin air. Do not let him guilt trip you.", "NTA. Your obligations are to your children. This includes planning for your future, a future that won't include you using your kids as a retirement fund. \n\nYour wife could have met her obligations directly by purchasing life insurance. Since she had a spouse, three young kids, and two parents who would be leaving the workforce shortly she needed that coverage as much as anyone. People in this situation, often take out a policy that is equal to 10-15x the insured's annual income. These policies pay lump sum and income tax free. Now that you're a single parent, I urge you to get a policy that would provide coverage at least until the youngest is old enough to be done with college. So, a 20-25 year policy.", "NTA.

Absolutely not.", "NTA\n\nYou could have used their help with your kids and household the last three years and they were only \"minimally\" involved.  They haven't given enough to your family to have any expectation that they deserve for you to support them for the rest of their lives.  \n\nRetirement isn't an age.  You don't just hit a certain age and quit your job and get to spend the next 30 or 40 years having someone else pay the bills.  That's not the way it works...", "Oh come on. They just retired and want to come mooch off you for how long? If your wife was around, you would have another person for your kids, another person to contribute financially, etc...you don't have that now. If they move in, you're basically never going to be allowed to date again and you will have them there for 20+ years. If you buy them a condo, where's that money coming from? \n\n>They have been minimally involved in our lives since my wife passed away.\n\nNo. You're not letting your wife down. Your wife passed away three years ago and you have three young kids. I'm sure you could have used their help at some point during those three years but not now when your kids are all school age. \n\nIf you were of her culture, would you be taking care of them or would you have already married again?

It was her promise, not yours. And when she passed it was still only a promise because nothing had been put in place. If they had made the effort to be thoroughly active in yours and your kid's lives then that would be different but they're only reaching out now because it benefits them. Stand your ground.

You can't help these people just because you married your wife. It is sad, but it is true. You have three young children", "This should have been a conversation anytime prior to his retirement after his daughter passed away. NTA. Circumstances changed, this topic should have been broached after the fact.", "NTA - your primary responsibility is to your kids and it sounds like you\u2019re holding up there. Great job, I can\u2019t imagine how hard that must be. \n\nAt the same time, if there\u2019s a way to help them, in a way that works for you AND them, then it is worth trying to find a way to help. The kids need grandparents. And although they\u2019ve been minimally involved, they\u2019re still possibly the best link your kids have to their mother. It takes a village to raise children and sometimes grandma and grandpa can help in ways dads can\u2019t do on their own. \n\nIs there some kind of middle ground? How much help do they actually need? Did they fail to save adequately? Are they financially sound?

I'm not sure what culture exactly your wife was from but I'm familiar with some that have similar beliefs. Filial responsibility is a big thing. To the point that those who willingly abandon it are seen as scummy.  You saw how your wife argued, you know. It's part of her and their culture. \n\nA culture that you CHOSE to marry into. Maybe you didn't really get what that meant, but if so that's at least 50% your fault.\n\nYour post is coming across as \"not my problem\" but sorry. It is. It became your problem when you put that ring on. And it sounds like she explained that. Just cuz she's not there to hold you to your promise...\n\nAnd the worse part of this is that it doesn't sound like you said ANYTHING to them leading up to this. Since this is part of their culture, it's part of how they plan out their lives.  Yet despite *knowing* that they had reason for expectation, you said nothing until AFTER he retired?\n\nYeah..YTA\n\nEdit: Also. Asking here is a little disingenuous imo considering reddit demographic has polled to be primarily American, with percentages at about white 17, black 17, hispanic 14.

Or what the dynamic was like between them. \n\nWhat we can infer, from what he said about FIL's call, was they were aware something had been discussed and a plan put in place.  \n\nIf he couldn't, he should've communicated that to them. Especially before the retirement. He was the one who made promises. It might have been at her behest, but he was part of it so, for me, the onus fell to him to communicate.", "You forgot fat, lazy and has a neckbeard.", "When the wife was alive there was another person to share it all with, finances, children etc... Now it is all OP. Circumstances changed.", "He never told his wife he would step in. As per the post when he discussed it with his wife he pointed out that they couldn't live in the same house due to space and money issues. HIS WIFE then decided she would try and buy a condo for them. She should've made sure something was in place instead of leaving him to deal with it. Especially seeing as he not once agreed to do anything about it.", "His wife is dead. Her wishes no longer matter and he never said yes to being with. Her opinion is irrelevant. She\u2019s DEAD!", "Then he FUCKED UP by marrying someone with whom he had such a major disagreement about something that's a big deal. I'm sure she would've set something up if she hadn't, you know, BEEN KILLED and all. JFC.", "I mean, if that's the case, then she fucked up even worse by marrying someone who she knew wouldn't honor that tradition. You know, because he made it crystal clear where he stood before they even married.", "Do the kids deserve less so op can take care of his deceased wife parents? If he not able to take care of them financially because he down to one income how is that fair to the children?"]}
