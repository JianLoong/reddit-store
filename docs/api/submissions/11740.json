I am now a single father to our 3 kids (11, 8, & 5).  It has been incredibly difficult providing for them by myself, but they've never wanted for anything a day in their life.  Thanks to therapy and a good support system, they are happy, healthy, and thriving.  \n\nIn my wife's culture, it is customary for children to take care of their parents in their old age.  Her parents very much expected this of her.  This was something my wife talked to me extensively about before and during our marriage.  Actually, it was something we fought about a lot because I felt that our focus should be on our kids and doing everything we could to give them a good life.  My wife wanted to house her parents in our home but I disagreed for multiple reasons such as cost and lack of living space.  We eventually agreed to help them pay for a condo or other living arrangements, but not house them.  Sadly, we never got a chance to figure out exactly how that would work.  \n\nHer parents, her mom specifically, took my wife's death hard and fell into depression.  She pretty much became a recluse and neither her nor my FIL have been very involved in our lives since my wife's death.  \n\nHowever, my FIL recently retired and reached out to me about honoring my wife's promise to help take care of them in their old age.  I flat out told him that I cannot honor that promise.  He got upset and told me that this was something that his daughter had promised him and his wife and as her husband, it is now my responsibility to keep that promise.  I told him that I have 3 kids to provide for and I do not have the time, energy, or money to provide for 2 more people.  He told me I was disgracing my wife's honor and memory and that he knew it was a mistake for her to marry outside of her culture.  \n\nHe called me again a few days later and tried to apologize for what he said.  He told me that he acted irrationally and that he's sure we can work something out that will be beneficial for everyone.  I asked him what he meant by that and he said that he and his wife could come live with us so that I have help with the kids and I can still honor my wife's promise to her parents.  I again flat out told him no.  I told him that I've managed fine the past 3 years without their help and I'll continue to do fine.  I told him his proposal is only beneficial to them, not to me in any way.  \n\nHe again tried to tell me that I need to do this to honor his daughter's memory as this was something that she promised to him and his wife.  I told him that sadly, that promise died with his daughter.  He said something to me in his native language that I'm assuming from his tone was not a compliment and hung up on me.  \n\nThey have been minimally involved in our lives since my wife passed away.  Their needs are so far down my priority list.  But I'm torn because I hate feeling like I'm letting my wife down in any way, even if she's not here anymore.", "created_utc": 1678228665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ldurk/aita_for_not_keeping_my_wifes_promise_to_take/", "score": 4305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My late husband\u2019s mother is a single older woman with two living daughters. However, she believed my husband and I would build a tiny home on our land for her and care for her and support her in her old age. We have an elementary aged child. I was never on board with this plan and neither was my husband, but he did ask me to look out for his mom after he died (he got sick so we had time to talk through all this). By look out for, he meant stay in her life, check on her, and be there in the event of an emergency. After my husband died, his mother went absolutely feral on me, making heinous accusations, blaming me for \u201cstealing\u201d her son from her, and promising me that she would never forgive me for being the one her son loved more than her. It\u2019s been almost 4 months since he died, and I have cut her from my life. I feel guilty sometimes, but I am a widow in my early 30s with a child to provide for. I cannot sacrifice my peace or my time with my child to care for a fully grown adult who failed to plan for her own future and who has been an absolute monster to me (far beyond the pale of grief). \n\nAll this to say, as someone in a similar situation, your priorities are your child and yourself. You matter. Your needs matter. You are categorically NTA. They abandoned their daughter\u2019s children for three years. They\u2019ve only resurfaced because they want something from you. Truly, you\u2019re NTA. Don\u2019t feel bad for one more second. Care for yourself and your family. I wish you all the best. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m so blown away and just incredibly moved by all the support being shown here. Thank you for all the awards and lovely comments. It\u2019s an isolating journey, and I\u2019m so thankful to this little corner of Reddit for reminding me how much goodness is in the world, and how important it is to show that kindness. OP, thank you for posting this question. I\u2019m so glad to see so many telling you the truth: you are NTA. \ud83d\udc99", "NTA.

Do not let him guilt trip you.", "NTA. Your obligations are to your children. This includes planning for your future, a future that won't include you using your kids as a retirement fund. \n\nYour wife could have met her obligations directly by purchasing life insurance. Since she had a spouse, three young kids, and two parents who would be leaving the workforce shortly she needed that coverage as much as anyone. People in this situation, often take out a policy that is equal to 10-15x the insured's annual income. These policies pay lump sum and income tax free. Now that you're a single parent, I urge you to get a policy that would provide coverage at least until the youngest is old enough to be done with college. So, a 20-25 year policy.", "NTA.

If you buy them a condo, where's that money coming from? \n\n>They have been minimally involved in our lives since my wife passed away.\n\nNo. You're not letting your wife down. Your wife passed away three years ago and you have three young kids. I'm sure you could have used their help at some point during those three years but not now when your kids are all school age. \n\nIf you were of her culture, would you be taking care of them or would you have already married again?

Great job, I can\u2019t imagine how hard that must be. \n\nAt the same time, if there\u2019s a way to help them, in a way that works for you AND them, then it is worth trying to find a way to help. The kids need grandparents. And although they\u2019ve been minimally involved, they\u2019re still possibly the best link your kids have to their mother. It takes a village to raise children and sometimes grandma and grandpa can help in ways dads can\u2019t do on their own. \n\nIs there some kind of middle ground? How much help do they actually need? Did they fail to save adequately? Are they financially sound?

I'm not sure what culture exactly your wife was from but I'm familiar with some that have similar beliefs. Filial responsibility is a big thing. To the point that those who willingly abandon it are seen as scummy.  You saw how your wife argued, you know. It's part of her and their culture. \n\nA culture that you CHOSE to marry into. Maybe you didn't really get what that meant, but if so that's at least 50% your fault.\n\nYour post is coming across as \"not my problem\" but sorry. It is. It became your problem when you put that ring on. And it sounds like she explained that. Just cuz she's not there to hold you to your promise...\n\nAnd the worse part of this is that it doesn't sound like you said ANYTHING to them leading up to this. Since this is part of their culture, it's part of how they plan out their lives.  Yet despite *knowing* that they had reason for expectation, you said nothing until AFTER he retired?\n\nYeah..YTA\n\nEdit: Also. Asking here is a little disingenuous imo considering reddit demographic has polled to be primarily American, with percentages at about white 17, black 17, hispanic 14.

Do they speak English? How severe was your MIL's depression, was she safe to be around kids or doing childcare? Did this happen during Covid and do they have comorbidities? Did you expect them to drop everything and move in with you and take care of your kids? And if they had, would you be supporting them, or would the same argument you had with your wife before still be in your mind? I mean, it really sounds like you never wanted to discuss piety in the first place, even when your wife was alive. So IDK what you want me to say, but don't be surprised that you're not getting 100% immediate validation in a literal judgement sub.", "Ehn, disagree. I live my life by different rules. But, ultimately not my or your problem.", "Yes you did lmao. What a horrible thing to say. You literally fought over this very issue when she was alive. The audacity you have to compartmentalize who she was as not being from that culture. You\u2019ve instead forced your own culture on her and your children. Best of luck with that my man. It\u2019s a shitty way to treat her memory.", "Remember that when you get old, your kids will throw you in a retirement home the first chance they get. You are teaching your kids how to treat you when you get old.", "The reality is this issue didn't start when wife died. It was present before they were even married. \n\n**She was abundantly clear and brought it up dozens of times especially BEFORE marriage because SHE KNEW it was a HUGE ask.** He said yes to her face so she married him. \n\nHe knew he was uncomfortable before he said I Do, he knew he didn't want to...he just assumed he'd be able to convince her out of it or duck out of it and not have to follow through. For that he was the AH long before she died.", "Agreed.\n\nThey will not be \"convinced\" of shamed out of this at any stage because this entitlement is absolute to them.", "They did. Over a lot of the things. I completely agree. Absolutely no coming back from it.", "OP admitted that his MIL had depression. How many times did OP reach out to his in-laws during this time? The phone works both ways, and I'm sure it would have been helpful for the kids to talk to their grandparents on a regular basis while they've been grieving.\n\nI'm not saying that he has to move them into his home, but his wife did wish for them to be nearby. I'm not sure why that plan is off the table at this point. This was something he had already discussed with his wife, and it was something she really wanted", "More children to spread the work load, subservient daughters or daughters-in-law, no student loans to pay off, multi generational households mean no/less childcare costs, young people have children sooner and so kids aren't as little when old people start needing help, old people die sooner so don't need full time care for as long.\n\nAmerica is highly individualistic but also the expectations we have for quality of life mean life is much more expensive.", "the lack of investment in social programs here is largely a product of rich people not needing the social programs and not wanting to give up any of their ridiculous wealth to fund them. plenty of average americans want things like universal health care and are willing to pay taxes and such to support it, but the rich don't need it and don't want to pay for it, and since they're the ones who have money and influence to throw around, the rest of get nothing.", "Where we they the last 3 years? As parents and grandparents isn't it their responsibility to help out? Isn't that part of most cultures? They are picking and choosing what's best for them. They are selfish AHs.", "Why is he an AH and nor the wife? She's trying to convince him to do something he doesn't want to do? \n\nMan you're going to fuck me, woman no. Man's an AH\n\nWoman we're going to support my parents, man no. Man's an AH? Huh? \n\nIf that's the case she should've never married him. She knew he was uncomfortable with it.", "If my wife were alive today we would still have 2 incomes to figure this out.  But she's dead and my priority is making sure my kids have everything they need.", "I understand your perspective, and I appreciate that you\u2019re trying not to say cultures are wrong for practicing filial responsibility, but I\u2019m not sure you really get just how deep this notion of filial responsibility really goes.\n\nUnless your parents/in laws have done something truly heinous - kicking you out, brutally beating you, forcing you into marriage, etc - refusing to support them in their old age is literally unheard of in my experience. If the wife had a good relationship with them - and from the sounds of it, she definitely did since she wanted them to live with her - it makes no sense from an Asian perspective for them to have no support now. I totally understand why the dad would have quit without thinking twice, assuming his son in law would be ok with supporting him.\n\nI don\u2019t think the parents not reaching out after their daughter\u2019s death qualifies as heinous enough for them to end up with no family support in their old age. That\u2019s literally been their only \u201ccrime\u201d, and I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s bad enough to deserve being told they don\u2019t matter to OP like this.\n\nThis might also be due to a cultural difference: your view is that it should have been 100% the parent\u2019s\u2019 responsibility to reach out to OP after the incident. I kind of see it as more of a 50-50 thing - neither side did a good job at reaching out and dealing with the trauma as a family. It would have been better if the parents reached out after the accident, but I don\u2019t see it as the parents\u2019 responsibility per se to have done so. Especially since, reading between the lines of OP\u2019s post, I don\u2019t get the impression that OP was ever close to them or really invited any interaction from them in his life. It\u2019s fully possible that the parents didn\u2019t know how to engage without the support of their daughter\u2019s presence. And again, I would offer them a bit more sympathy with regard to the trauma of losing their only daughter.\n\nHonestly, this kind of situation is a huge reason why Asian parents struggle with intercultural relationships and marriages so much. I told my mom this story, and she immediately went \u201csee, this is why people should marry someone with their same culture and values\u201d (yeah, I shouldn\u2019t have shared this story with her, I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s the conclusion she\u2019d draw)\n\nI married someone white, and my parents were deeply concerned at first that I had ended up with someone who wouldn\u2019t care about my culture and respect my customs. It was really hard for all of us, because there is such a huge difference between how Americans and Asians view parent-child roles, and sometimes there\u2019s no good way to reconcile them. Thankfully my husband is in some ways more Asian than I am - he never had this attitude of \u201cnot my parents, not my problem\u201d, and he understands that if we come to a point where they need to live with us, that is absolutely happening.\n\nFrom an asian perspective, OP\u2019s in laws did nothing wrong and yet even after raising their daughter with love and care (I\u2019m assuming this  since the daughter wanted them to live with her), they now find themselves in their old age with no one to rely on.", "I could feel for OP more if he\u2019d done anything at all for his in laws than just refuse to see them as part of his family.", "I don\u2019t know, grieving perhaps? What country are they from? That will give a lot of context here.", "HE SAID YES! That's why she married because HE SAID YES. Even tho he didn't really want to or intend to, HE AGREED to the HUGE THING she said she knew could be a deal breaker and he said he understood.\n\nIdk how you don't see he said yes with his words, but he really felt no and didn't even understand her cultural attachment to wanting this nor cared to understand it. \n\nI'm not saying buy them their own condo and they aren't either. They are offering to trade childcare for a spare room he has. He never intended to help her parents if she wasn't there begging constantly since prior to marriage.", "But they don't have everything they need. Their mother is gone, and it sounds like you're making very little effort to keep them in contact with the best possible person to help them with that loss, her mother. Having your wife's mother around nearby would be beneficial to both your kids and to her as well, and this is what your wife wanted. But you're not doing that. You're doing quite the opposite of that.", "Thank you for the respectful insight into this. I agree, this is cultural disconnect. In my culture, families take care of each other in a circular way. Parental responsibility doesn\u2019t stop when your kids have kids, and kids support and care for their elders in the same ouroboros. No one only has one step of a ladder of support. \n\nIf my wife died and my parents isolated themselves, did not help my kids, it would be shameful. They would be viewed with shame. You grow up how you grow up, and that makes the most sense to me. I completely understand how it wouldn\u2019t to someone who didn\u2019t, same as the above scenario. \n\nHowever, I would say in any cultural structure, there are people who take advantage of it and act in bad faith. There are toxically individualistic people in my culture. I would also ask if there\u2019s no way that someone could both observe a long held traditional belief, and also push the boundaries of good faith in it.  OP\u2019s wife\u2019s parents raised her, and loved her, and put her first in that raising. \n\nOP is doing the exact same for his own children, who lost their only mother.", "Would you see someone who only saw you as a cash for as family?? They let down OP and their grandkids when they needed them, it\u2019s very hypocritical to expect to be helped back", "I mean they didn't show up for OP after his spouse died. OP says in another comment that they visited rarely and even is wife wasn't very involved with them. I don't think they're not his family, they're just not a very good one.", "Bullshit, grieving I understand but 3 years?\n\nIf that's legit then he's still grieving and having her parents around is too much. Does that work for you?", "Where does it say he said yes and that's why she married him? Please link it or point it out. I must be blind. \n\nHe writes they fought before and after getting married. So how was it a yes before? \n\nOK let's move on say they agree to move in, what about the last 3 years says they will help with childcare? 3 years of nothing? Where were they then? As parents and grandparents isn't it their responsibility to help out? In any culture?", "WT ever-loving F.  If you think my MIL is the best possible person to help my kids deal with the loss of their mother, then she spent the past 3 years epically failing in that regard.", "That\u2019s not how his wife viewed them. She loved them and wanted them to live with her. OP stopped that. He doesn\u2019t even have the courtesy to honor his wife\u2019s wishes by taking care of the people she loved and who raised her.\n\nOP also says in a comment that his MIL was dealing with too much grief to talk to him, and his FIL was busy taking care of her. There\u2019s a huge difference between \u201cwouldn\u2019t help\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t help\u201d.\n\nAlso, \u201conly saw you as cash\u201d really oversimplifies non-western parent-child roles. Parents take care of the kid when they\u2019re young, kids/spouses take care of parents when they\u2019re old. That\u2019s the culture. It\u2019s not about seeing OP as just cash, it\u2019s about them participating in a totally different culture with different expectations of adult children.", "How is it possible his wife wasn\u2019t very involved with them, but she also wanted them to live with her, and wanted to pay for a condo for them?\n\nAnd OP also says they were grieving and depressed. Not showing up because you mentally can\u2019t and not showing up because you didn\u2019t want to are two different things.", "What country are they from?", "Again, you mentioned that she had depression, which makes it difficult to function day-to-day when left untreated.  It was clear that your wife loved her parents dearly. It doesn't sound like they were abusive, or chronic drug users, or narcissists, etc. It sounds like she loved them and wanted to honor them because they were good people.\n\nWe also know that seeing extended family after a loss can be very helpful in the grieving process. When is the last time you arranged for your children to see their grandparents?", "My partner is Vietnamese and even tho I\u2019m western my family always takes in the parents as they get older, mum has taken in her parents and my partner and I will most likely (and happily) take in his mum and my parents as well. I don\u2019t need you to explain why this happens to me.\n\nWhen I lost one of my brother, our world collapsed. You know who didn\u2019t?? My parents, they stepped in for his kids and their mum despite how much they were hurting too. They didn\u2019t ghost our family for 3 years before coming back with their hands out. \n\nThe dad could have rang, he could have paid for a babysitter some nights so that OP could have at least a second to himself to help process losing his wife, he could have visited just ONCE to show that he still cared. I understand that sometimes people simply can\u2019t process after a loss like this, but you can\u2019t abandon your family when they are at their worst, even if you are too, and then expect everything to just be fine. \n\nI saw how my partner\u2019s entire family flew in from all over the world to help him and his mum and sister\u2019s after his dad died (including his dad\u2019s mum). I\u2019ve seen the love and care they give even when they had nothing left. You say that he\u2019s letting down his late wife?? No, her parents failed her and their grandchildren. OP\u2019s wife needed her parents more than ever when she passed to provide the support and love to their kids that she no longer could, and they didn\u2019t. Wether it was because they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t doest matter, it still doesn\u2019t feed the children", "I would assume the wife felt she had to take care of her parents regardless because she was raised that way.\n\nAlso OP said he thinks MIL might have been depressed. How would OP know specifically, they didn't contact him for 3 years? I get that they were devastated with the loss of their daughter, but doesn't that empathy also apply to OP and the children? They want to be so part of this family, but they can't even show up.\n\nWhen my father died I was crushed, I still made sure my mom was taken care of though.", "What does it matter? What context will it provide? They essentially disappeared for years and came back knocking for their retirement plan. What country would make that ok? Please tell me.", "NTA, I'm Latina and my grandma lives with my mom, mom's husband, and my sisters in the family home, she never expected her children to take care of her because she had a husband but things changed. My grandma has always been very present in our lives, and never lost touch with any of her children or her grandkids, including me when I moved overseas. That's the main thing here the ILs just stepped out until they needed smth and that's not fair at all. you need to look out for your family and give them the best you can.", "NTA - was your wife (sorry for your loss) their only child?", "So you are definitely NTA. The situation would only benefit them. I feel bad because the situation is shitty in itself but you are only responsible for your kids not your wife\u2019s\u2019 hopes/wishes. While it is nice to do it isnt a requirement since your wife has passed. Also kinda weird my dad passed when i was in my early 20\u2019s and i know that my grandma(my moms MIL) would never ask to stay at her house despite any health issues. So weird  for them to expect that", "NTA. Even if you were inclined to do this the circumstances have changed wildly.", "NTA. These people saw their daughter as nothing more than their retirement plan and now they expect a single father of 3 kids to take care of them. It doesn\u2019t matter what your wife promised them you didn\u2019t promise them anything. And you are not dishonoring your wife I\u2019m sure she would be more concerned about you and your kids being ok that\u2019s what matters. I\u2019ve always thought of the promises or agreements anyone makes with a loved one before death is just a way to put them at ease and help them feel more at peace with being gone. Nobody is bound to any of those promises outside of that.", "NTA, but just to share\u2026\n\nI am of Asian culture. Where I\u2019m from (SEA), a big reason why, aside from filial piety that\u2019s ingrained in our blood, we are expected to take care of our parents is because there are no retirement homes here in my country. Every family here takes care of their parents. My husband discussed this with me when we read OP\u2019s story here, that if I were to pass, he would do his best to take care of my parents as they\u2019ve been an integral part of our children\u2019s lives (we work daily while they take care of our kids, cook for us, etc.) We all get along smoothly.\n\nBut the problem here is that OP\u2019s wife\u2019s parents have been non existent in their lives and therein lies the problem. It DOES sound entitled, especially to western point of views, but as a Chinese, one of the biggest takeaways I found in the post was the father taking the small step to apologize first. This is absolutely unheard of in my culture, and if OP is interested, he can find a middle ground for them. This is the Chinese in me speaking though. Lawfully, it is entirely OP\u2019s right to decide what he wants. Some part of me wishes they all could have a heart to heart sometime, that\u2019s all. \n\nBut I understand OP\u2019s resentment and not wanting to have anything to do with them, so in this regard, it\u2019s a NTA for me, although I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better solution out there rather than going NC.\n\nOP, where are your in laws from? One of the most popular solutions here in my country is to hire a permanent domestic helper to care for one\u2019s wife parents. As for who\u2019s footing the bill, it\u2019s mostly split between parents and child but it\u2019s entirely up to you. Perhaps you can consider this if domestic helpers are the norm there. This way, there will be minimal involvement on both sides, and it can be considered as honoring your wife\u2019s promise, kids can still visit grandparents, everyone\u2019s happy.", "YTA. You knew it was important to her. You have to find a way to help her parents; it's fine if it's not everything they expect, but you need to do _something_.", "YTA You agreed to help with housing and I\u2019m guessing she told them this and now it\u2019s a completely different situation and she\u2019s not here but you\u2019re not even going to try to problem solve with them and make sure they\u2019re okay? This seems disgraceful, especially since you mentioned they have no one else. Honestly, if I was your wife and there was an afterlife and I would be so disappointed. You\u2019re obviously very selfish and self centered.", "NTA. She made the promise, not you, and the two of you hadn\u2019t worked out what her fulfillment would look like. With her death circumstances drastically changed. You don\u2019t have the time, space, energy, money, or emotional capacity to be taking care of five people in addition to yourself. Hopefully your wife had a life insurance policy so things have been a bit easier for you, but that money is supposed to help your immediate family adapts to her no longer bringing in an income. Caring for three kids on your own has got to be exhausting. Adding two elderly people who will only become more dependent over time won\u2019t help. And what happens if your parents need care?  Finally what happens if you decided to date and remarry?  Are you going to move your new spouse in with your in laws who will feel like they have every right to dictate how the house is run and to tell her what to do with their grandkids?  It just had disaster spelled all over!", "NTA. If the parents wanted to be taken care of under this set of circumstances, they should have done more to get her to marry someone from her culture. You're already honoring her memory *and* them by raising their grandkids on your own. Sometimes a culture has a really good idea, which honoring and helping your parents is, but then when people from that culture move to another country where that isn't a cultural norm, and is in fact prohibitively expensive for most younger people, they can't expect that aspect of their culture to necessarily be upheld. You can't take everything you love about your home country with you.", "Absolutely not. They are trying to parasite off your hard work.  NTA", "NTA.  Taking care of 6 people (including yourself) is too big an ask.  I\u2019m not going to speculate about where they\u2019ve been for the last 3 years or what they should have, could have done.

Right now you have to do what you can for your children. They have to be the top priority. \n\nI\u2019m well aware of filial piety but I\u2019ve never heard of it applying to a widower, just widows. Usually those (I\u2019m assuming Asian) cultures consider that a woman marries in to another family and becomes their family member. Not that the man has no obligation to his wife\u2019s family but I didn\u2019t think that applied after her death.

They need to make an effort to be involved in their grandkids lives. That certainly IS normal in their culture.", "Absolutely NTA. You are SO NTA. Please take care of yourself and your children and never, EVER question your choices. My former partner came from a culture with similar expectations and it was one of the biggest stressors on our relationship, since I had to eventually accept that my children and I were less important to him than his parents. I'm assuming you're in the US? - here is how you can help yourself to some peace about this. The ENTIRE American economy, culture, and social norms are created around a nuclear family unit and generational separation. It is *literally* called a SINGLE-family home. You cannot house them and you cannot provide for them because everything about how this system works is for a single family unit. I'm sorry that their retirement plan was your wife, but that's just not how it works here.", "NTA. The thing about promises, is they can\u2019t always be kept.

Best of luck to you and your family.", "NTA - Not your culture, not your promise, not your way, not your honor, not your job, not in your economy, not enough time, this is not on you.", "NTA. The best way you can honour your wife is by keeping her memory alive for your kids. Making sure they know that even if in the future you date or remarry, that you loved your wife and are sad she died. That no matter what, they can always talk about her. Or ask questions about her. That it\u2019s ok to sometimes miss her. And sometimes be happy about memories you have. That their grief over their loss will change as they age and go through different life stages without her. And knowing that you will be there to tell him things like their mom would be so proud of them, that she would\u2019ve loved to be at their graduation, wedding etc.\n\nIMO I think being aware of how to best help them as they grow with dealing with their loss and making sure they always know your wife loved them, and that you loved her, and that it\u2019s ok to move on in life and it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t miss the one you lost while also continuing to instil the values you and your wife shared is what honours her best.\n\nTrying to hold yourself to something you didn\u2019t even agree to when your wife was alive, which as also based on the assumption you\u2019d have your wife\u2019s support (and possibly income) isn\u2019t fair to yourself if it strains you emotionally and financially which will negatively affect your kids.\n\nKeep doing the best you can. Try to reach out and organize visits with your in laws and the kids even if say AH things on the phone to you that you can overlook. As long as their actions and words aren\u2019t harming your kids, trying to look past their expression of their grief to keep your kids in their life is a way you can honour your wife.

If their whole retirement plan was being taken care of by their child then they should have made new arrangements when she passed. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this first hand. My parents took in my moms parents. One with mobility problems, one with Alzheimer\u2019s that got so severe that she became violent. Even if they are fine right now, they may not always be. Being a caregiver at that stage is extremely difficult. Now add in being single parent to multiple kids. I cannot even imagine the stress.

Memory is just that, a memory. You are honoring their daughter's memory by providing for your kids and staying healthy. After that only talk about what the kids do and achieve. I would distance myself for a while until the kids are bigger. You need your space and mental heath to focus. If they arrive with baggage, call police and uber to the nearest inn . Your wife has been brainwashed since she was a kid about her priorities. You haven't. If you take them in, they will make your life hell, and your kids will be displaced, as you have no room for them and they will make your kid's life hell as well by teaching them to honor them all  the time.

It can be a deep financial necessity. Our core economic unit is multiple generations in the same household, and everything operates with this in mind at the deepest levels of consequence. The western parent, expecting to be abandoned in their old age, saves some proportion of their monthly income for that eventuality. *Our* parents dump that same amount and more into boosting our upbringing. This means we get a better education, a better job, a better house. We might even get a better spouse. I don't know how you met your wife, but, if it was while she was studying abroad, that's a downstream consequence of the extra parental support. In return for all that, we have to reciprocate. Not doing so is, materially, consigning our parents to poverty or a much worse standard of living than they could've had had they anticipated the betrayal and prepared for it.\n\nOf course, westerners, if they even notice this chain of reciprocation, find such an arrangement highly uncomfortable and oppressive.

But if I\u2019m guessing the country of the in-laws correctly, I think there\u2019s more to this than just culture and customs. The in-laws are subject to a financial system that relies on generational caregiving. Because of these things, I think it was always assumed your in-laws would have a symbiotic relationship with your family once they retired (aka. moving in and helping with the kids while you and your wife supported them financially in their final years). Their daughter married someone outside their culture and they \u201capproved\u201d it because she promised this aspect of their way of life would stay the same, despite different upbringings on what family values are. She is also their only child and therefore their only lifeline, so it was a big leap of faith on their part to agree and believe this would stay the case (though ultimately given modern ways, their approvals really didn\u2019t matter on whether your wife and you got married or not). \n\nHowever you are raising 3 kids on your own in a culture that does not have this \u201cfamily takes care of each other\u201d custom.

However the all-or-nothing approach to their demands has me wondering if there\u2019s a middle ground somewhere? Like you offer a lump sum to get them going, but they have to find their own way from there. Or helping to research any public support options they can lean on. You said they have siblings. Someone can help share the burden. I think they would understand not having any financial means to support them.

Not saying her culture denies amplification to voices that would have given real perspective. \n\nAnd for me, that red flag got realized when I saw OPs response to me: a dismissive snark. He lashed out at the person who didn't take his side. I think he came here to just get affirmation to make himself feel better. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nCould I see this dropping to an ESH if we got appropriate perspective? Yes.

If it required the sacrifice of my first born child then I think we would agree that the culture should be ignored but when its something like this, I would say that it's different. His wife knew that he was not thrilled about looking after her parents and he knew that she knew. It's reasonable to infer that had she realised that what happened was a serious possibility, they would have been divorced.

You don\u2019t forget THEM, you still love and miss them, that pain never goes away, but for me, I can remember very few things more than 3 years ago, aside from the good stuff.

As a westerner, I would expect my in laws to step in and help me if my spouse were to die leaving me alone to raise their grandkids. The fact that OP\u2019s in-laws didn\u2019t \u2014 that they basically disappeared for three years \u2014 seems, to a westerner, like the very definition of \u201cfuck you, I only care about me.\u201d \n\n(The fact that they then showed up upon retirement to demand financial support is so shameless that I felt revolted embarrassment for them.)\n\nMore accurately, western culture isn\u2019t actually about \u201cfuck you, I only care about me.\u201d It\u2019s actually more like \u201cfuck you if you think familial duties only go one way, because they are reciprocal, and only children and those who are incapacitated are expected to take, take, take without ever giving.\u201d", "\u2026 guess you could say\n\n\n\n\u2026 you have much to learn", "They are saying Americans are awful for not taking care of adult family members.

So your MIL is recluse now, but allowing that human contact with her grandchildren can also get her out of it, maybe it won't.\n\nAn honest and non-accusatory discussion about the situation is the adult thing to do. Tell them that while you have always had reservations about supporting them completely, that before your loss, that you were thinking of ways to support them while reserving your personal space.\n\nEven though you say that for the last 3 years have been fine without them, it sounds just as much that you could use their support as well. It also sounds like you've never truly bonded with them the whole time you and your wife were together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last item to think about, is given the situation, how long do they have left? How long are you going to alienate your children from them? to keep them in the \"we only know them because we saw them on occasion\" instead of the \"we really got to know them, and appreciate the time we spent together\"?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause for me, those were kinda the two relationships I had with my own grandparents. On one side I didn't spend as much time on my fathers side as I did with my mothers. My dads father died early in my life from cancer, while it seemed that my grandmother would never pass. On my mothers side I had a great relationship and often played cards with them, really getting to know who they were as people instead of people who gave me gifts at Christmas or my Birthday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that's not mentioned, is their age and the financial stability of everyone involved. I don't know if they'll surprise you with an inheritance, if their situation could afford you & your family a better place to live, if they're straight up looking for you to pay for everything.\n\nI don't think that last part is the actual reason, he worked, he retired, they have a home now. They have some security, but some of it sounds like they don't have all the security they need like making sure they're still alive, that they still have someone to talk to, that maybe their friends are also kicking the bucket.", "Hi OP, while you are not wrong in wanting to focus the resources on yourself and the 3 kids but it seems to me that you are also trying to justify the decision by stating that your parents in law are minimally involved in your lives after the passing of your wife? \n\nYou mentioned that your MIL took it exceptionally hard, fell into depression and became a recluse. I am assuming that your wife was the only child and therefore the only caregiver for your MIL is your FIL(If there are other children and especially if they have a son, the duties to look after your parents in law will fall on their shoulders) . So I was just wondering, how are you expecting or how would you then like them to be involved in your lives?\n\nAs what others might have suspected, is your wife an Asian? If yes, usually our culture dictates that the younger generation to be taking the initiative to maintain the familial connections.\n\nI hope what I have shared with you above would help you to see things from another perspective.

Honestly, if I was your wife and there was an afterlife and I would be so disappointed. You\u2019re obviously very selfish and self centered.\n\nThis is disgusting, straight up vile of you to say. It's already hard for him to take care of his own three children, and you're implying that his wife should be disappointed of him in the afterlife because he can't take care of two more people? Elderly people at that. Absolutely shameful of you, treating a widower like this.

As someone who has been in his kids\u2019 situation, loosing a parent very young, I still would have been appalled by this. The reason I brought up religion too is that if his spouse was religious or believed in the afterlife this is even worse. Multiple people said in the comments said \u00ab\u00a0she is dead and her wish dies with her\u00a0\u00bb and that\u2019s just not how it works.  \n\nFor lots of us, the death of a person doesn\u2019t mean we have to stop honoring their wishes or memory by respecting what they wanted. \n\nIf his wife had other siblings it wouldn\u2019t be in question. But she was an only child - and- she told him repeatedly, so this was clearly something very important to her. People are being \u00ab\u00a0we choose the children\u00a0happiness first\u00a0\u00bb. Believe me it\u2019s not like we are forgetting the children. The difference is not there. It\u2019s that we value family differently including the fact that unless you have a shitty family, family is forever. We don\u2019t kick out kids at 18, ask for rent, or refuse to help and if they want to live with you forever with their kids and spouse it\u2019s okay. Multiple generations living together is a thing. \n\nUltimately, we told our pov to OP anyway. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And we tried to explain how it is as did others.
