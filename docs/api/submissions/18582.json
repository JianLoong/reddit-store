But the fact that you insist she takes a weekend trip to your parent's house instead of a paid-for European vacation is crazy.\n\nYou know, if going home is so bad, you can just.... not go?", "Ungently, YTA\n\nA trip with her boyfriend and his family, regardless of the destination, is more important than being an emotional support animal with you to see your parents. \n\n>some of our mutual friends have started to not invite me to places either\n\nIf I were in the friend group, I'd stop inviting you places and then tell you exactly why.", "Yta.\n\nI doubt there is any controversy in your friends group and you are coming here hoping to be validated, that someone will agree with you.\n\nYou are holding your friend emotionally hostage.  You can't see your family on your own? Then obviously you should not be going to visit them at all. I believe you need a therapist if this is the case.\n\nDid I read it right??? Your break up was a year ago?\n\nHey give up a free trip to Europe with your bf so you can hold my hand while I visit my mom and tell her I broke up with my bf a year ago? If not you're an ah? \n\nThis is exhausting and I suspect many of your friends are telling you this, likely not as blunt as the internet.", "She isn\u2019t an emotional support dog you can just drag around with you and hoard to yourself. YTA", "I'm confused about what you think your roommate's obligation to you is. YTA.", "YTA - you\u2019re seriously putting yourself above her partner because you\u2019re having a hard time? That\u2019s not what friends do. She shouldn\u2019t have to adapt her life to cater to your sensitivity. And you as a friend should absolutely be encouraging her to go on a trip with her boyfriends family, what an amazing opportunity for her! \n\nBut\u2026 You can also feel let down. I think people are distancing themselves from you because you seem to feel entitled to have your friends catering to you because you\u2019re still struggling with your breakup - I\u2019d recommend therapy to help navigate your struggles. You can\u2019t rely on your friends to carry you.", "Oh, do get over yourself. \n\nYTA", "YTA. - normally I'd be on OP side, hate when people back out of plans they previously committed to. \n\n However someone getting invited on a surprise vacation to another country that's paid for.  Yeah I'm not going to fault someone for that.  It's not like they chose to go to someone else's hometown or something, this could be a once in a life time trip.", "You expect your friend to miss a once in a lifetime chance to have a paid trip to Europe? And this would be a huge milestone for their relationship. \n\nYTA and very selfish.", "YTA, you sound pretty selfish and self-centered. It\u2019s a shame your relationship broke up, but that does not mean that everyone else has to put their lives on hold to support you. Why in the world would you expect a friend to give up a surprise trip to Europe to go home with you to your admittedly unhappy family weekend just so you don\u2019t feel alone? \n\nDoubling down on the \u2018keeping promises\u2019 bit is also out of line, it\u2019s not like she was donating a kidney and went back on her word - you are being extra nasty by making this about her integrity.\n\nA real friend would be thrilled for the opportunity she has, not expecting her to give it up to sit at your parents\u2019 where _even you are not comfortable._", "YTA. I say that as someone who strongly believes that you shouldn\u2019t drop plans because something else more fun comes along. This trip to Europe was a surprise to her too. It wasn\u2019t something she planned. \n\nI think it\u2019s unfair of you to ask her to stick to her word on this, and it\u2019s obviously having social consequences for you now. This could really damage your friendship with her and seemingly with others in your group. \n\nIf you really need her there, then postpone your trip home. More importantly, you should take a look at why you\u2019re depending on other people so much for support. I\u2019d suggest getting into therapy.", "YTA. I suspect not just in this case. You\u2019re an adult, you can go see your parents alone. And I\u2019m very curious as to how she disrespects your feelings? I\u2019m guessing she \u201cflaunts her happiness\u201d?", "I understand you're in a bad place emotionally right now, but you have unreasonable expectations for your friend. It sounds like she's been there for you, but you have to understand she has her own life too, it doesn't all revolve around you. She made plans to come with you but at the time she didn't know about the vacation, sometimes things come up and plans get postponed or canceled. It's not reasonable to expect her to skip a trip to Europe in order to come visit your parents with you. Sorry but YTA.", "YTA and you\u2019re being more than a little self involved. \n\nYou have over a month to make alternative arrangements or decide not to go home, she has a potentially once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Europe.", "YTA. This is tough, as someone who also believed friends should hold true to promises. However, life happens.  You want her to turn down a surprise trip to Europe because you need emotional support or handholding to visit your parents after your breakup? Postpone the dreaded trip.  You didn\u2019t want to go anyways. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re making this the hill to die on is slowly alienating her, and the rest of your friend base.", "YTA. Nothing that Anya has done is good enough in your eyes. She probably needs a vacation from your emotional leeching.", "YTA. She is not at your beck and call.", "YTA\n\nYou're selfish and jealous and honestly downright petty. I'm glad I don't know you.", "YTA - you ARE a third wheel in their relationship and she\u2019s not obligated to fill the space left by your boyfriend.  You are being a selfish person and rotten friend to insist that she miss a free European vacation so she can hold your hand during a weekend visit to your parents.  \n\nTough love time, grow up.  People aren\u2019t pulling away because she is dragging you, it\u2019s because your behavior is showing what you bring to the table in a friendship and it\u2019s mostly downside.", "YTA She didn't make the plans, her partner's parents did. She wasn't aware of the plans when she agreed to tag along on your trip home. At this point you're just being unreasonable. And the reasons your friends are distancing themselves from you is because you're selfish. The world doesn't revolve around you and your issues with your parents.", "*At first she was considerate about my situation, but it just feels like she has completely disregarded my feelings and the horrible year I\u2019ve had whenever Eli is around.*\n\nWhat does this mean exactly? Like how is she disregarding your feelings \"when Eli is around\"?\n\nAlso, based on the wording of \"the horrible year\" are you telling me that the breakup was a year ago?", "You're a jealous asshole.", "Of course you're going to feel bad that she can't be there with you, but **it's a trip to Europe**.\n\nAnd you're accusing her of not having integrity?\n\nThis promise has two parts:\n\n1. Her commitment to you\n2. You holding her to that commitment\n\nWhat if she wanted to break her commitment to get her dream job? Or cash in a lottery ticket?  Or run to the hospital to meet a dying relative?\n\nI hope you would completely forgive her under those circumstances. It's all about how much you recognize the value of her other option, and while (hopefully) you would agree that she would be expected to choose the other option in those cases, it seems you and your friend differ on the worth and importance of this trip.\n\nI get that your values are different, but from most people's perspective, a true friend would release her from obligation in this situation.\n\nYou're not being fair to her\u2014a trip to Europe doesn't fall under the category of simple \"fun\". She isn't choosing a party over helping you. A trip like that can be a highlight of someone's entire life that they will reminisce about forever. And while your weekend will be uncomfortable, how likely is it that it will be a low point of your life that will haunt you forever? I'm pretty sure this is WAY more of a plus for her than an uncomfortable 4th of July for you.\n\nBottom line, you're the one letting her down, not the other way around.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but if I have to make a judgment, YTA, not her.", "Will she likely have the opportunity to go to Europe all expenses paid again in the next year?? \nHas she ever been before this??\nIf the answer to either question is no then yes yta. Grow up there isn't a reason 1 you can't go home alone.", "YTA  Of course, for the most part, it's reasonable to expect others to adhere to their promises. But part of being emotionally mature and secure is knowing when to let people off the hook, like when they really do get a better offer that would be ridiculous to turn down. A free European vacation vs going to someone's childhood home strictly to function as their emotional support animal is obviously no contest.  I'm sorry you're down but I would recommend being thankful she was willing to go with you at all.  Let her enjoy her trip and don't bring her down with you (she's tried being supportive, but she can't cater to you forever). If she turns out to be a flake in the future (over more every day items) then you can find other friends.", "YTA, I get that you\u2019re unhappy but that\u2019s not their fault. The friend would clearly want to go on a surprise vacation.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're leaning too hard on Anya and when an offer came up which meant she reasonably had to back out of going away with you for the weekend, you attacked her character.\n\nHer deciding to go on holiday with her partner and his family is not some major backstab to majority of people, but you're coming at it from a place of deep hurt because you've been using her as a large part of your support network. She is not selfish for having a change of heart. \n\nShockingly, you don't have to be Anya's first thought. It's time to put on your big girl pants and start to deal.", "YTA. I am currently in a similar situation to Anya and the fact that my friend can\u2019t get over her bad situation is really getting on my nerves. It sucks that you had a breakup and I get that it\u2019s hard to be around happy couples, but Anya isn\u2019t obliged to cater to you forever. Grow up.", "YTA", "YTA. Sucks that you've had a rough year, but it seems that you are being irrational. Just because you've had a rough time does not mean that your friend needs to walk in eggshells to not upset you. Secondly, things happen and plans change, you need to be able to adapt without acting like you're some sort of victim of her very normal behavior.", "YTA\n\nSorry but you are making it all about you. \n\nGoing home to your own parents is not something you need someone else there for - and it was a kindness that she was willing to go - but certainly not at the expense of missing an incredible opportunity \n\nIt's not about integrity at all. It's just not ALL about you. You want her to make her life all about you when it just isn't. That's just facts. You resent her for not keeping your current state of mind present at ALL times meaning when she is with her bf. Of course she isn't going to put you first in such situations, nor should she. People have relationships. This is normal. People break up. This is normal too. Stop expecting everyone to act like this was an earth-shattering thing. \n\nYou JUST went through this and that's fair to be bothered by it but you can't expect everyone to permanently treat you with kid gloves for it.", "YTA. You're acting crazy", "YTA\n\nIt obviously sucks that she had to back out of your plans but she has her own life and she\u2019s not your bf, as a friend you shouldn\u2019t even want her to miss a trip like that. It sounds very possessive and selfish, that\u2019s probably why her and your mutual friends aren\u2019t talking to you. It\u2019s harsh but it\u2019s my honest answer.", "YTA\n\nAnya is not your emotional support animal. She's a living breathing person with her own life and relationship; that doesn't end just because *you* went through a breakup. If seeing your family is an issue, stay home.", "YTA\n\nYour emotional state is not your friend's responsibility. It sounds like what you actually need is a therapist, especially since you referred to it being a tough *year*. \n\nFriends can offer support of course, but it's not fair to expect your friends to out their lives on hold. Anya isn't going to (and shouldn't have to) stop being happy in her relationship just because you're in a different place. \n\nYou are being selfish. And it sounds like your friendship has become so centered around your selfishness you didn't notice. Going to Europe with her bf is worthy of being more important than being your emotional support human for a weekend while you visit your family. She could have talked to you about it, sure. That definitely would have been the polite way to handle but based on your post, I assume she thought you'd say no. She didn't want to be put in the awkward position of telling you she doesn't need your permission but you put her in that situation anyways.", "You need to apologize to her, ask her what help she needs getting ready for the trip, and be contrite to your mutual friends about badmouthing her. You were overly sensitive and you will promise to do better. \n\nYou can postpone your trip home until someone can go with you, and find something fun to do at home. YTA, but you don\u2019t have to be TA permanently.", "YTA. I am so sorry you\u2019re having a rough time right now. If she was dropping you for a weekend getaway in the same area I\u2019d say she was the a hole, but I\u2019d be willing to piss off my own husband for a free week in Europe.", "Get counseling. YTA.", "YTA\n\nSeems to me that you resent her happiness.\n\nShe is in a committed relationship.\nPartner trumps over roommate/friend in prioritizing.\nAccept it.\nBe happy for her.\nShe is not your emotional support animal.\nYou can postpone your trip to accommodate her timetable if you really need/want her there.\n\nPeople need to understand that they might be the lead character in their movie but that doesn't make everyone else a supporting character in the same movie.\nYou need to accept that other people are playing the lead in their own lives movie where you are not the love interest/lead just a side characters of friend just as she is in yours trying to cast her as anything other does you both a disservice.\n\nMove on.", "This is a tough one. I get where you are coming from. And honestly, as much as I love my close friends and family, turning down a trip to Europe would be really hard. INFO - is this likely to be her only chance to go? I mean, does she have money/ways of going on vacations like this? If she does, then I could definitely lean more towards your side because it's not a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" thing. Also INFO, is there absolutely no one else that can go with you and provide support? And lastly, do you know that Anya is telling your other friends to mistreat you? Maybe she is telling all truth and they are judging for themselves that you're in the wrong (regardless of whether you are or not, they still may have other perceptions of you that we here do not/can not).\n\nPersonally, until I know the above info, I'm withholding judgment.\n\nETA - I see lots of commenters that are making good points, and honestly going back and re-reading your post, you do sound a little childish, selfish, and unreasonable. I think I have to go with YTA.", "YTA for the fact that you seem to feel entitled to a larger claim on your friend than her bf should get to have.

You are roommates/friends with someone who is in a relationship with another human being, and the way you speak about it makes it sound like you don\u2019t think she has a right to a happy relationship while you\u2019re miserable and single. Would you want to be friends with someone who thought of you that way?\n\nYou\u2019ve been leaning hard on someone who isn\u2019t a trained therapist and making her responsible for your baggage. Please seek out a therapist, because they are trained to help people work through issues. Your other friends are likely pulling away because of how wildly entitled you\u2019re acting. \n\nPeople are not emotional support animals. Friends are not trained therapists. Holding a friend hostage to your personal misery over a breakup from a year ago (?!) is completely unreasonable. If travelling to see your family is that awful, don\u2019t go. And please seek therapy before your actions completely doom this friendship. It seems like Anya cares about you and wants to help you, and she 100% has the right to live her own life and follow her own dreams.

You are being a bad friend to give her a hard time.", "YTA. I'm afraid you're asking too much of a friend. Get on a wait-list for a counselor or try one of the counseling apps.

The vacation may be a disaster and then you can be sad, breakup buddies.

What do you bring to the friendship?", "YTA, but let me explain. You're allowed to feel upset by a breakup. However, it sounds like you are exhausting your friends with how you are handling it. Also, your friend is allowed to change her mind about accompanying you to your parents' house for the weekend.

I think you are asking way too much. I get that you are feeling raw, but you are a grown up. Stop pouting and moping - and get some help. You are consumed with yourself. You are being TA.", "YTA. Why would you want to drag your friend into your awkward family situation that she has no investment in or reason to suffer?  But even worse, if you were a true friend, why would you want her to give up a once in a lifetime holiday for your little pity party???  You\u2019re very very self-centred and not being a good friend yourself. A good friend would want their friends to be happy and have the best. You\u2019re dragging her down. You are a third wheel.

A lot of people with pets credit them for saving their lives when they were at their darkest places. But there\u2019s definitely responsibility there that has to be taken into account.", "Yta and don\u2019t be surprised when you have no friends.  Your lack of self awareness is astounding and the audacity to call anyone selfish when your post is only about you and what you want.", "If you loved your friend, you would be excited for her.

How long is she suppose to try and help you get over it exactly?
