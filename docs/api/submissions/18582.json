But the fact that you insist she takes a weekend trip to your parent's house instead of a paid-for European vacation is crazy.\n\nYou know, if going home is so bad, you can just.... not go?", "Ungently, YTA\n\nA trip with her boyfriend and his family, regardless of the destination, is more important than being an emotional support animal with you to see your parents. \n\n>some of our mutual friends have started to not invite me to places either\n\nIf I were in the friend group, I'd stop inviting you places and then tell you exactly why.", "Yta.\n\nI doubt there is any controversy in your friends group and you are coming here hoping to be validated, that someone will agree with you.\n\nYou are holding your friend emotionally hostage.  You can't see your family on your own? Then obviously you should not be going to visit them at all. I believe you need a therapist if this is the case.\n\nDid I read it right??? Your break up was a year ago?\n\nHey give up a free trip to Europe with your bf so you can hold my hand while I visit my mom and tell her I broke up with my bf a year ago? If not you're an ah? \n\nThis is exhausting and I suspect many of your friends are telling you this, likely not as blunt as the internet.", "She isn\u2019t an emotional support dog you can just drag around with you and hoard to yourself. YTA", "I'm confused about what you think your roommate's obligation to you is. YTA.", "YTA - you\u2019re seriously putting yourself above her partner because you\u2019re having a hard time? That\u2019s not what friends do. She shouldn\u2019t have to adapt her life to cater to your sensitivity. And you as a friend should absolutely be encouraging her to go on a trip with her boyfriends family, what an amazing opportunity for her! \n\nBut\u2026 You can also feel let down. I think people are distancing themselves from you because you seem to feel entitled to have your friends catering to you because you\u2019re still struggling with your breakup - I\u2019d recommend therapy to help navigate your struggles. You can\u2019t rely on your friends to carry you.", "Oh, do get over yourself. \n\nYTA", "YTA. - normally I'd be on OP side, hate when people back out of plans they previously committed to. \n\n However someone getting invited on a surprise vacation to another country that's paid for.  Yeah I'm not going to fault someone for that.  It's not like they chose to go to someone else's hometown or something, this could be a once in a life time trip.", "You expect your friend to miss a once in a lifetime chance to have a paid trip to Europe? And this would be a huge milestone for their relationship. \n\nYTA and very selfish.", "YTA, you sound pretty selfish and self-centered. It\u2019s a shame your relationship broke up, but that does not mean that everyone else has to put their lives on hold to support you. Why in the world would you expect a friend to give up a surprise trip to Europe to go home with you to your admittedly unhappy family weekend just so you don\u2019t feel alone? \n\nDoubling down on the \u2018keeping promises\u2019 bit is also out of line, it\u2019s not like she was donating a kidney and went back on her word - you are being extra nasty by making this about her integrity.\n\nA real friend would be thrilled for the opportunity she has, not expecting her to give it up to sit at your parents\u2019 where _even you are not comfortable._", "YTA. I say that as someone who strongly believes that you shouldn\u2019t drop plans because something else more fun comes along. This trip to Europe was a surprise to her too. It wasn\u2019t something she planned. \n\nI think it\u2019s unfair of you to ask her to stick to her word on this, and it\u2019s obviously having social consequences for you now. This could really damage your friendship with her and seemingly with others in your group. \n\nIf you really need her there, then postpone your trip home. More importantly, you should take a look at why you\u2019re depending on other people so much for support. I\u2019d suggest getting into therapy.", "YTA. I suspect not just in this case. You\u2019re an adult, you can go see your parents alone. And I\u2019m very curious as to how she disrespects your feelings? I\u2019m guessing she \u201cflaunts her happiness\u201d?", "I understand you're in a bad place emotionally right now, but you have unreasonable expectations for your friend. It sounds like she's been there for you, but you have to understand she has her own life too, it doesn't all revolve around you. She made plans to come with you but at the time she didn't know about the vacation, sometimes things come up and plans get postponed or canceled. It's not reasonable to expect her to skip a trip to Europe in order to come visit your parents with you. Sorry but YTA.", "YTA and you\u2019re being more than a little self involved. \n\nYou have over a month to make alternative arrangements or decide not to go home, she has a potentially once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Europe.", "YTA. This is tough, as someone who also believed friends should hold true to promises. However, life happens.  You want her to turn down a surprise trip to Europe because you need emotional support or handholding to visit your parents after your breakup? Postpone the dreaded trip.  You didn\u2019t want to go anyways. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re making this the hill to die on is slowly alienating her, and the rest of your friend base.", "YTA. Nothing that Anya has done is good enough in your eyes. She probably needs a vacation from your emotional leeching.", "YTA. She is not at your beck and call.", "YTA\n\nYou're selfish and jealous and honestly downright petty. I'm glad I don't know you.", "YTA - you ARE a third wheel in their relationship and she\u2019s not obligated to fill the space left by your boyfriend.  You are being a selfish person and rotten friend to insist that she miss a free European vacation so she can hold your hand during a weekend visit to your parents.  \n\nTough love time, grow up.  People aren\u2019t pulling away because she is dragging you, it\u2019s because your behavior is showing what you bring to the table in a friendship and it\u2019s mostly downside.", "YTA She didn't make the plans, her partner's parents did. She wasn't aware of the plans when she agreed to tag along on your trip home. At this point you're just being unreasonable. And the reasons your friends are distancing themselves from you is because you're selfish. The world doesn't revolve around you and your issues with your parents.", "*At first she was considerate about my situation, but it just feels like she has completely disregarded my feelings and the horrible year I\u2019ve had whenever Eli is around.*\n\nWhat does this mean exactly? Like how is she disregarding your feelings \"when Eli is around\"?\n\nAlso, based on the wording of \"the horrible year\" are you telling me that the breakup was a year ago?", "You're a jealous asshole.", "Of course you're going to feel bad that she can't be there with you, but **it's a trip to Europe**.\n\nAnd you're accusing her of not having integrity?\n\nThis promise has two parts:\n\n1. Her commitment to you\n2. You holding her to that commitment\n\nWhat if she wanted to break her commitment to get her dream job? Or cash in a lottery ticket?  Or run to the hospital to meet a dying relative?\n\nI hope you would completely forgive her under those circumstances. It's all about how much you recognize the value of her other option, and while (hopefully) you would agree that she would be expected to choose the other option in those cases, it seems you and your friend differ on the worth and importance of this trip.\n\nI get that your values are different, but from most people's perspective, a true friend would release her from obligation in this situation.\n\nYou're not being fair to her\u2014a trip to Europe doesn't fall under the category of simple \"fun\". She isn't choosing a party over helping you. A trip like that can be a highlight of someone's entire life that they will reminisce about forever. And while your weekend will be uncomfortable, how likely is it that it will be a low point of your life that will haunt you forever? I'm pretty sure this is WAY more of a plus for her than an uncomfortable 4th of July for you.\n\nBottom line, you're the one letting her down, not the other way around.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but if I have to make a judgment, YTA, not her.", "Will she likely have the opportunity to go to Europe all expenses paid again in the next year?? \nHas she ever been before this??\nIf the answer to either question is no then yes yta. Grow up there isn't a reason 1 you can't go home alone.", "YTA  Of course, for the most part, it's reasonable to expect others to adhere to their promises. But part of being emotionally mature and secure is knowing when to let people off the hook, like when they really do get a better offer that would be ridiculous to turn down. A free European vacation vs going to someone's childhood home strictly to function as their emotional support animal is obviously no contest.  I'm sorry you're down but I would recommend being thankful she was willing to go with you at all.  Let her enjoy her trip and don't bring her down with you (she's tried being supportive, but she can't cater to you forever). If she turns out to be a flake in the future (over more every day items) then you can find other friends.", "YTA, I get that you\u2019re unhappy but that\u2019s not their fault. The friend would clearly want to go on a surprise vacation.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're leaning too hard on Anya and when an offer came up which meant she reasonably had to back out of going away with you for the weekend, you attacked her character.\n\nHer deciding to go on holiday with her partner and his family is not some major backstab to majority of people, but you're coming at it from a place of deep hurt because you've been using her as a large part of your support network. She is not selfish for having a change of heart. \n\nShockingly, you don't have to be Anya's first thought. It's time to put on your big girl pants and start to deal.", "YTA. I am currently in a similar situation to Anya and the fact that my friend can\u2019t get over her bad situation is really getting on my nerves. It sucks that you had a breakup and I get that it\u2019s hard to be around happy couples, but Anya isn\u2019t obliged to cater to you forever. Grow up.", "YTA", "YTA. Sucks that you've had a rough year, but it seems that you are being irrational. Just because you've had a rough time does not mean that your friend needs to walk in eggshells to not upset you. Secondly, things happen and plans change, you need to be able to adapt without acting like you're some sort of victim of her very normal behavior.", "YTA\n\nSorry but you are making it all about you. \n\nGoing home to your own parents is not something you need someone else there for - and it was a kindness that she was willing to go - but certainly not at the expense of missing an incredible opportunity \n\nIt's not about integrity at all. It's just not ALL about you. You want her to make her life all about you when it just isn't. That's just facts. You resent her for not keeping your current state of mind present at ALL times meaning when she is with her bf. Of course she isn't going to put you first in such situations, nor should she. People have relationships. This is normal. People break up. This is normal too. Stop expecting everyone to act like this was an earth-shattering thing. \n\nYou JUST went through this and that's fair to be bothered by it but you can't expect everyone to permanently treat you with kid gloves for it.", "YTA. You're acting crazy", "YTA\n\nIt obviously sucks that she had to back out of your plans but she has her own life and she\u2019s not your bf, as a friend you shouldn\u2019t even want her to miss a trip like that. It sounds very possessive and selfish, that\u2019s probably why her and your mutual friends aren\u2019t talking to you. It\u2019s harsh but it\u2019s my honest answer.", "YTA\n\nAnya is not your emotional support animal. She's a living breathing person with her own life and relationship; that doesn't end just because *you* went through a breakup. If seeing your family is an issue, stay home.", "YTA\n\nYour emotional state is not your friend's responsibility. It sounds like what you actually need is a therapist, especially since you referred to it being a tough *year*. \n\nFriends can offer support of course, but it's not fair to expect your friends to out their lives on hold. Anya isn't going to (and shouldn't have to) stop being happy in her relationship just because you're in a different place. \n\nYou are being selfish. And it sounds like your friendship has become so centered around your selfishness you didn't notice. Going to Europe with her bf is worthy of being more important than being your emotional support human for a weekend while you visit your family. She could have talked to you about it, sure. That definitely would have been the polite way to handle but based on your post, I assume she thought you'd say no. She didn't want to be put in the awkward position of telling you she doesn't need your permission but you put her in that situation anyways.", "You need to apologize to her, ask her what help she needs getting ready for the trip, and be contrite to your mutual friends about badmouthing her. You were overly sensitive and you will promise to do better. \n\nYou can postpone your trip home until someone can go with you, and find something fun to do at home. YTA, but you don\u2019t have to be TA permanently.", "YTA. I am so sorry you\u2019re having a rough time right now. If she was dropping you for a weekend getaway in the same area I\u2019d say she was the a hole, but I\u2019d be willing to piss off my own husband for a free week in Europe.", "Get counseling. YTA.", "YTA\n\nSeems to me that you resent her happiness.\n\nShe is in a committed relationship.\nPartner trumps over roommate/friend in prioritizing.\nAccept it.\nBe happy for her.\nShe is not your emotional support animal.\nYou can postpone your trip to accommodate her timetable if you really need/want her there.\n\nPeople need to understand that they might be the lead character in their movie but that doesn't make everyone else a supporting character in the same movie.\nYou need to accept that other people are playing the lead in their own lives movie where you are not the love interest/lead just a side characters of friend just as she is in yours trying to cast her as anything other does you both a disservice.\n\nMove on.", "This is a tough one. I get where you are coming from. And honestly, as much as I love my close friends and family, turning down a trip to Europe would be really hard. INFO - is this likely to be her only chance to go? I mean, does she have money/ways of going on vacations like this? If she does, then I could definitely lean more towards your side because it's not a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" thing. Also INFO, is there absolutely no one else that can go with you and provide support? And lastly, do you know that Anya is telling your other friends to mistreat you? Maybe she is telling all truth and they are judging for themselves that you're in the wrong (regardless of whether you are or not, they still may have other perceptions of you that we here do not/can not).\n\nPersonally, until I know the above info, I'm withholding judgment.\n\nETA - I see lots of commenters that are making good points, and honestly going back and re-reading your post, you do sound a little childish, selfish, and unreasonable. I think I have to go with YTA.", "YTA for the fact that you seem to feel entitled to a larger claim on your friend than her bf should get to have.

Would you want to be friends with someone who thought of you that way?\n\nYou\u2019ve been leaning hard on someone who isn\u2019t a trained therapist and making her responsible for your baggage. Please seek out a therapist, because they are trained to help people work through issues. Your other friends are likely pulling away because of how wildly entitled you\u2019re acting. \n\nPeople are not emotional support animals. Friends are not trained therapists. Holding a friend hostage to your personal misery over a breakup from a year ago (?!) is completely unreasonable. If travelling to see your family is that awful, don\u2019t go. And please seek therapy before your actions completely doom this friendship. It seems like Anya cares about you and wants to help you, and she 100% has the right to live her own life and follow her own dreams.

You are being a bad friend to give her a hard time.", "YTA. I'm afraid you're asking too much of a friend. Get on a wait-list for a counselor or try one of the counseling apps.

The vacation may be a disaster and then you can be sad, breakup buddies.

And you don't want to be the person that emotionally blackmails friends. Is that what your parents do?", "YTA.  Dont get in the way your friends amazing opportunity.", "YTA.A trip to Europe vs.a weekend with your family? In my opinion you are the selfish AH.", "Ooo boy, if I were in her position, I would back off slowly. You sound incredibly entitled and needy. A word of advice: I would do some serious self reflecting. If you want friends, you need to adjust expectations back to 'realistic'.", "YTA would you really give up a paid European vacation to go to your roommates parents house?\nIt was nice of her to offer to a car accompany you, but her situation has changed, and you need to adjust.\nIf you are still having such a hard time with your break up, perhaps it\u2019s time to speak with a counselor or therapist. A friend and roommate can only do so much.", "YTA. Your break up is not your roommates problem or mess. If you are still struggling with it AND you feel you can't go home without company, go to therapy. Unless it was a funeral or something I'd never ask a friend to turn down a free vacation to Europe.", "Yta everything is all about you and your wants. Question for you. Is this why your bf broke up with you? Because your needy, clingy, and so entitled. Learn how to wipe your own butt. No one needs to hold your hand nonstop. You are acting like my 3 year old throwing a tantrum when he doesn't get his way.", "YTA you sound exhausting. She is not your personal therapy dog", "YTA. I too would chose Europe over going to a friends hometown. This might be a once in a lifetime opportunity for her, it sounds like you\u2019re relying a little to much on her for emotional support. She can probably sympathize that you\u2019re having a rough time after your breakup but it\u2019s not actually her problem to deal with, it\u2019s something you should maybe talk to a therapist about. They may actually have good suggestions and coping techniques to get you through this rough time. I hope things look up for you, try to be happy your friend is going to have this experience and support her decision. If you don\u2019t you may not have a friend for too long.", "YTA. The rest of the world does t have to suffer through your pity parade forever. You are selfish. Time to grow up or else your world will shrink very quickly.", "YTA, I'm sorry your dating life is hard right now but she isn't responsible for that. I'm sure if situations were reversed you would be quite upset to miss a once in a lifetime trip to accompany her to her family BBQ.\n\nYou need to start to branch out a little in your friend group so that you aren't holding your fiends good romantic relationship against her as if she's with him happily in some kind of afront or attack on you!", "Oh OP YTA you need to join a club and make some new friends", "Right? That seemed SUCH an odd phrase... It's not that you're even a third wheel in the relationship - you aren't in the relationship at all", "It's not a crime to be jealous and I think folks who ding OP for that are missing the real point. \n\nSome folks have much worse lives than other people and jealousy is a natural and sometimes even healthy reaction. The world isn't fair - it's okay to notice that. It's okay to grieve and wish you got to have the privileges of other people. As someone with no family and very little money I can say that honestly I'd be insane if I didn't let myself punch my pillow sometimes. The people around me just got a happier better life than me for no reason at all. It sucks. \n\nBUT!! Op is absolutely the asshole. She is taking it out on her friend. And *that's* the actual issue. She has every right to be jealous. She does not have the right to take it out on her friend. She needs to learn to see that the tough hand she got dealt is terrible and immutable. The people in her life can't fix it for her and she has to learn to thrive despite the set back. It's an incredibly tough lesson and it's brutal. She's young and hopefully this is a phase she'll look back on and grow from.", "op is being unreasonable but if you haven't come from an unloving or abusive family yourself it can be hard to understand the dynamics. I spent 5 full years refusing to ever be alone with my father before deciding to make a permanent break. Why didn't it occur to me estrange myself earlier when being alone with him made me truly distressed? It's hard to say but in a very deep way - having to orphan yourself is hard it's devestating and it can be beyond the imagination until you grow wiser and realize your worth and your boundaries. The fantasy of a father was worth the pain until it wasn't. My heart is with OP her situation is very hard. It doesn't mean that she is being reasonable. Her friend absolutely should go to Europe - and with OP's blessing. But the \"simply just don't go\" folks are also being too flippant. \"Simply not going\" is actually incredibly hard. I hope OP looks back on this one day from a place of growth and healing. And can apologize to her friend and grow a strength around her family she doesn't yet have. She is the asshole but those YTA's should be gentle ones.", "Do you honestly think it\u2019s appropriate to make her give up a free trip to Europe to deal with your sad ass and your terrible family?! \n\nWhy are you even going to see this family if you can\u2019t handle seeing them alone?! \n\nA good friend would be happy that their friend is getting such an amazing trip. \n\nYou\u2019re codependent and you need therapy. It\u2019s been a year. You need to get over the loss of your relationship and move on with your life. Jesus Christ.", "\ud83d\ude2c", "It's not flippant when she says her friend lacks integrity.... \n\nI mean context matters but she is also ready to judge her friend in the worst way bc it affects her.", "Yeah, friends version of this story is probably 10x worse.", "I 100% agree with your second half and OP is absolutely the AH. I just do think folks are being flippant about her family situation. For me it's a two wrongs don't make a right thing. She is wrong but also deserves compassion around the rough family life"]}
