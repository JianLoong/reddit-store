The bottom flat is mine, it\u2019s the largest and it\u2019s the only one that has an access to the garden. If you sit at the back of my garden you can see inside the first floor flat though their windows.\n\nMy first floor neighbour is Natalia (f33). I\u2019ll admit it she\u2019s gorgeous and on top of that she\u2019s intelligent, she\u2019s a translator and I can hear her speaking on the phone and I could listen to her switch between 3 languages all day. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t attracted to her. I\u2019ve never had the courage to ask her out though. But that\u2019s not the reason why I occasionally glance at her windows.\n\nWhen you sit in my garden, you can see directly inside her flat. She has curtains in her windows on the other side of the building (looking out the street) but I guess she forgot to put them on the side form the garden. Anyway, I am a smoker so whenever I sit down to have a f (not sure if I can say this word for a cigarette here) I entertain myself by looking up. I can see whatever she\u2019s doing and I find it fascinating, I can see who she is as a person and admittedly she\u2019s fascinating and very different to all the other women I know. I mean the fact that she doesn\u2019t watch love island was a great start. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a creepy prepping Tom, she\u2019s not changing in front of the windows or anything but I have seen her in her pjs which kind of makes her more human to me (I kind of thought she was a bit frigid and robotic at first).  and I\u2019m getting more courage to ask her out. Honestly, I don\u2019t think you can just go up to a beautiful and smart woman and seeing those little glimpses of her private life makes it easier.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I had some mates over the other day and we were sitting in the garden smoking, it was 3 guys, a female friend and me. And Natalia came back home and was doing stuff and they saw me looking up her windows. \n\nMy mates joked around but weren\u2019t really against it, just made fun of me. Banter, reallly. My female friend told  me it was creepy that I put those chairs their on purpose and could easily move to them as to not stare into her windows. I told her that she\u2019s just jealous cause no one is looking into her windows and she told me I was a creep and went back inside telling all her female friends (it was my birthday party and I had plenty of friends and friends of friends over). When I got back, my mates were taking the piss but some females there were a bit funny and sided with her. I told her to leave and not come back because I\u2019m not a creep and it\u2019s shitty of her to say that I am.\n\nShe called me an asshole, took her things and left but She made Facebook posts about me, calling me all sorts and maki bf sure everyone I know hears about this.\n\nNow I\u2019m confused, my mates agree with me but some people under her posts agree with her.

You claim to watch her so you were see her as 'more human' but you constantly judge her based on her looks and her interest. I highly doubt you have ever had a conversation with her to get to know her. Women actually like that because it shows you genuinely are interested in us.\n\nPlease don't ask her out. You also treated your female friend like garbage after she called you a creep, which she wasn't wrong. To be childish and say she was jealous was uncalled for. I wonder if you would have acted the same if a male friend called you a creep. I can only imagine what you would be like in a relationship when you can't even have a decent friendship with a female.\n\nTo be honest, if you want to show you are a decent human being and not objectifying the woman you are peeping on, you would quit watching her.

The bottom flat is mine, it\u2019s the largest and it\u2019s the only one that has an access to the garden. If you sit at the back of my garden you can see inside the first floor flat though their windows.\n\nMy first floor neighbour is Natalia (f33). I\u2019ll admit it she\u2019s gorgeous and on top of that she\u2019s intelligent, she\u2019s a translator and I can hear her speaking on the phone and I could listen to her switch between 3 languages all day. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t attracted to her. I\u2019ve never had the courage to ask her out though. But that\u2019s not the reason why I occasionally glance at her windows.\n\nWhen you sit in my garden, you can see directly inside her flat. She has curtains in her windows on the other side of the building (looking out the street) but I guess she forgot to put them on the side form the garden. Anyway, I am a smoker so whenever I sit down to have a f (not sure if I can say this word for a cigarette here) I entertain myself by looking up. I can see whatever she\u2019s doing and I find it fascinating, I can see who she is as a person and admittedly she\u2019s fascinating and very different to all the other women I know. I mean the fact that she doesn\u2019t watch love island was a great start. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a creepy prepping Tom, she\u2019s not changing in front of the windows or anything but I have seen her in her pjs which kind of makes her more human to me (I kind of thought she was a bit frigid and robotic at first).  and I\u2019m getting more courage to ask her out. Honestly, I don\u2019t think you can just go up to a beautiful and smart woman and seeing those little glimpses of her private life makes it easier.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I had some mates over the other day and we were sitting in the garden smoking, it was 3 guys, a female friend and me. And Natalia came back home and was doing stuff and they saw me looking up her windows. \n\nMy mates joked around but weren\u2019t really against it, just made fun of me. Banter, reallly. My female friend told  me it was creepy that I put those chairs their on purpose and could easily move to them as to not stare into her windows. I told her that she\u2019s just jealous cause no one is looking into her windows and she told me I was a creep and went back inside telling all her female friends (it was my birthday party and I had plenty of friends and friends of friends over). When I got back, my mates were taking the piss but some females there were a bit funny and sided with her. I told her to leave and not come back because I\u2019m not a creep and it\u2019s shitty of her to say that I am.\n\nShe called me an asshole, took her things and left but She made Facebook posts about me, calling me all sorts and maki bf sure everyone I know hears about this.\n\nNow I\u2019m confused, my mates agree with me but some people under her posts agree with her. Am I  the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Only I didn't know right away that he had been looking in my window. This window was facing another house, but I had quite a bit of land that this house was on. I figured there was enough land in between us that I didn't have to worry. \n\nAnyway, he asked me out, and for a few months we dated. I found out that he was an alcoholic, and I couldn't be with someone tjst refused to get help.\n\nIt was during my breaking up with him conversation that I found out he was peeking in my window with binoculars!! \n\nAfter our split, he wouldn't leave me alone, and I had to get a restraining order put on him.

That's being a creep. \n\nBut furthermore. Not only happy on creeping your neighbor, when a friend pointed it out, you got mad at her for stating the obvious and then acted like unwanted male attention is a gift of creepy men to any woman by saying she was jealous for not being creeped on. Believe me no woman wants a freaking stalker. Sheesh.\n\nEvery woman said you were a creep. Men didn't care. Obviously you decided that men knew better about what women liked or disliked.

Telling his 'friend' that she's jealous that nobody is creeping on her? What an ah!", "The titles of some of these posts on this sub are so misleading. If he happened to just glance up once real quick, not really that big of a deal - people look around\u2026 but to keep doing it to the point he knows all this info about her & is obvious with it? \n\nThat\u2019s creepy man.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was wondering!

I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t blame her and say she wanted him to watch and didn\u2019t put up curtains on purpose.

The more I think about it the more I worry for his neighbour", "But haven't you read his post? Any women who find his behaviour terrifying are just jealous! It's as if peeps like OP had no idea that the reason women are creeped out is because it's not some theoretical thing - most of them \\*have\\* experienced these kinds of behaviours first hand, from a young age, and they are scared or creeped out for very good, life experience-based reasons.", "I agree with the basic point but as a man this is blatantly obvious that this shit is creepy", "Glad you revisited but disagree.

It's one thing to occasionally see her walking around, but to pay enough attention to know what shows she watches is stalker territory.", "He knows what she *doesn't* watch on TV, which sort of means he sees so much of what she watches that he can eliminate the possibility of her watching certain shows.", "I'm hoping that someone is just rewatching in preparation for season 4 coming out next week, and that OP isn't actually this creepy because what.the.fuck.", "I thought as well.", "He thinks that any male attention is a gift to a woman.

He just calls it that so he can say \"oh Im going to sit in my garden now\" aka Im gonna go bird watching, and the bird's name is Natalia. She speaks 3 languages dont ya know? He knows that cause he hears the different languages being spoken when he eaves drops on her convos while sitting in his \"garden\" She is so nice too, how does he know that? Not by talking to her but thats how she's built up in his mind. I wonder if in his mind how far the relationship is? Maybe theyre dating? I wonder if in his mind she told him he's a weirdo who stares at some poor woman while she's in the privacy of her own home? Who are his friends that told OP that what he's doing is fine?

Like does this woman need to live in THE DARK with no natural light because her neighbor can\u2019t control himself??

This hurts my heart for her and women in general.", "I mean, I know one neighbour does watch Bones, but it's because movement from the tv caught my eye while I was walking past their open window and as a fan of the show myself I recognized the scene and characters, so in theory it is possible to know one or two shows your neighbours watch without also being a creep.   \n\n\nThis however sounds more like he's dedicated so much time he knows her whole schedule.", "I can see in the windows of the next building from my couch and couldn\u2019t even tell you what age or gender the residents are let alone what they wear to bed or watch on tv.

He doesn't come to the door, thank the gods but apparently he walks past? He legit got a job at the movie theater I had a membership to when it reopened after lockdown ended because he was hoping to see me.

She\u2019s not like the other stupid women who watch love island. She would understand. They\u2019re soulmates because HE appreciates that she isn\u2019t a dumb bimbo!

I wish we could warn her.", "seriously !!!! my thoughts exactly, someone please just warn this poor woman", "One time my male neighbor literally *walked through my bushes* and knocked on my window and gave me a thumbs up because he could see me changing. It was creepy as fuck. \n\nThe situation was that the landscape company had thinned out the trees outside my window (apartment complex) and I didn\u2019t realize it; beforehand you couldn\u2019t see in at all. But even with less foliage it was not that obvious unless you were trying to look in. I know because I went outside to check. \n\nHis defense was \u201cmy kids shouldn\u2019t be seeing that!!\u201d but like\u2026I don\u2019t know, leave a note on the door??", "Translucent blinds that close from bottom to top, leaves the whole top of the window uncovered.

Scary af.\n\nEdit: also teach his kids to not stare into peoples windows. Duh", "These are obvious solutions that she could implement if she finds out about this (hopefully) and can\u2019t move (hopefully not) but it\u2019s reasonable for her to exist in her home with the blinds open and not to expect to worry about a creepy unhinged dude watching her all day every day. :(", "He wasn\u2019t concerned about his kids. He was a legitimate awful person. Like we had to call the cops on him multiple times because we could clearly hear him verbally and physically abusing his wife/girlfriend. I don\u2019t believe for a second he was \u201cjust thinking of the kids!!\u201d\n\nAnd agreed lol it would be so easy to *not* look in a stranger\u2019s window, I would\u2019ve appreciated a heads up that you could see in now but come onnn"]}
