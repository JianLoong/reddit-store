The bottom flat is mine, it\u2019s the largest and it\u2019s the only one that has an access to the garden. If you sit at the back of my garden you can see inside the first floor flat though their windows.\n\nMy first floor neighbour is Natalia (f33). I\u2019ll admit it she\u2019s gorgeous and on top of that she\u2019s intelligent, she\u2019s a translator and I can hear her speaking on the phone and I could listen to her switch between 3 languages all day. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t attracted to her. I\u2019ve never had the courage to ask her out though. But that\u2019s not the reason why I occasionally glance at her windows.\n\nWhen you sit in my garden, you can see directly inside her flat. She has curtains in her windows on the other side of the building (looking out the street) but I guess she forgot to put them on the side form the garden. Anyway, I am a smoker so whenever I sit down to have a f (not sure if I can say this word for a cigarette here) I entertain myself by looking up. I can see whatever she\u2019s doing and I find it fascinating, I can see who she is as a person and admittedly she\u2019s fascinating and very different to all the other women I know. I mean the fact that she doesn\u2019t watch love island was a great start. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a creepy prepping Tom, she\u2019s not changing in front of the windows or anything but I have seen her in her pjs which kind of makes her more human to me (I kind of thought she was a bit frigid and robotic at first).  and I\u2019m getting more courage to ask her out. Honestly, I don\u2019t think you can just go up to a beautiful and smart woman and seeing those little glimpses of her private life makes it easier.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I had some mates over the other day and we were sitting in the garden smoking, it was 3 guys, a female friend and me. And Natalia came back home and was doing stuff and they saw me looking up her windows. \n\nMy mates joked around but weren\u2019t really against it, just made fun of me. Banter, reallly. My female friend told  me it was creepy that I put those chairs their on purpose and could easily move to them as to not stare into her windows. I told her that she\u2019s just jealous cause no one is looking into her windows and she told me I was a creep and went back inside telling all her female friends (it was my birthday party and I had plenty of friends and friends of friends over). When I got back, my mates were taking the piss but some females there were a bit funny and sided with her. I told her to leave and not come back because I\u2019m not a creep and it\u2019s shitty of her to say that I am.\n\nShe called me an asshole, took her things and left but She made Facebook posts about me, calling me all sorts and maki bf sure everyone I know hears about this.\n\nNow I\u2019m confused, my mates agree with me but some people under her posts agree with her.

You claim to watch her so you were see her as 'more human' but you constantly judge her based on her looks and her interest. I highly doubt you have ever had a conversation with her to get to know her. Women actually like that because it shows you genuinely are interested in us.\n\nPlease don't ask her out. You also treated your female friend like garbage after she called you a creep, which she wasn't wrong. To be childish and say she was jealous was uncalled for. I wonder if you would have acted the same if a male friend called you a creep. I can only imagine what you would be like in a relationship when you can't even have a decent friendship with a female.\n\nTo be honest, if you want to show you are a decent human being and not objectifying the woman you are peeping on, you would quit watching her.

The bottom flat is mine, it\u2019s the largest and it\u2019s the only one that has an access to the garden. If you sit at the back of my garden you can see inside the first floor flat though their windows.\n\nMy first floor neighbour is Natalia (f33). I\u2019ll admit it she\u2019s gorgeous and on top of that she\u2019s intelligent, she\u2019s a translator and I can hear her speaking on the phone and I could listen to her switch between 3 languages all day. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t attracted to her. I\u2019ve never had the courage to ask her out though. But that\u2019s not the reason why I occasionally glance at her windows.\n\nWhen you sit in my garden, you can see directly inside her flat. She has curtains in her windows on the other side of the building (looking out the street) but I guess she forgot to put them on the side form the garden. Anyway, I am a smoker so whenever I sit down to have a f (not sure if I can say this word for a cigarette here) I entertain myself by looking up. I can see whatever she\u2019s doing and I find it fascinating, I can see who she is as a person and admittedly she\u2019s fascinating and very different to all the other women I know. I mean the fact that she doesn\u2019t watch love island was a great start. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a creepy prepping Tom, she\u2019s not changing in front of the windows or anything but I have seen her in her pjs which kind of makes her more human to me (I kind of thought she was a bit frigid and robotic at first).  and I\u2019m getting more courage to ask her out. Honestly, I don\u2019t think you can just go up to a beautiful and smart woman and seeing those little glimpses of her private life makes it easier.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I had some mates over the other day and we were sitting in the garden smoking, it was 3 guys, a female friend and me. And Natalia came back home and was doing stuff and they saw me looking up her windows. \n\nMy mates joked around but weren\u2019t really against it, just made fun of me. Banter, reallly. My female friend told  me it was creepy that I put those chairs their on purpose and could easily move to them as to not stare into her windows. I told her that she\u2019s just jealous cause no one is looking into her windows and she told me I was a creep and went back inside telling all her female friends (it was my birthday party and I had plenty of friends and friends of friends over). When I got back, my mates were taking the piss but some females there were a bit funny and sided with her. I told her to leave and not come back because I\u2019m not a creep and it\u2019s shitty of her to say that I am.\n\nShe called me an asshole, took her things and left but She made Facebook posts about me, calling me all sorts and maki bf sure everyone I know hears about this.\n\nNow I\u2019m confused, my mates agree with me but some people under her posts agree with her. Am I  the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Only I didn't know right away that he had been looking in my window. This window was facing another house, but I had quite a bit of land that this house was on. I figured there was enough land in between us that I didn't have to worry. \n\nAnyway, he asked me out, and for a few months we dated. I found out that he was an alcoholic, and I couldn't be with someone tjst refused to get help.\n\nIt was during my breaking up with him conversation that I found out he was peeking in my window with binoculars!! \n\nAfter our split, he wouldn't leave me alone, and I had to get a restraining order put on him.

That's being a creep. \n\nBut furthermore. Not only happy on creeping your neighbor, when a friend pointed it out, you got mad at her for stating the obvious and then acted like unwanted male attention is a gift of creepy men to any woman by saying she was jealous for not being creeped on. Believe me no woman wants a freaking stalker. Sheesh.\n\nEvery woman said you were a creep. Men didn't care. Obviously you decided that men knew better about what women liked or disliked.

OP is a creep and so are the other guys standing up for him. The neighbor however knows that her windows look onto the garden. She may not realize that the angle allows a visual sight line into her space, which is why I think the chairs should be moved and if they have a friendly neighbor relationship it isn't a terrible idea to clue her in that the sight line is there. But she may also be choosing to live with open views, because of wanting the extra light or exhibitionism or whatever, and in that case it doesn't make what he's doing less gross but it does mean she accepts some level of strangers looking in which is weird."]}
