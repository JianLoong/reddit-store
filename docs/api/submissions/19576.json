You try and get them to eat a cooked meal or say no to junk food they cry till they are sick, they scream like your hurting them, they throw their plates and food at you, they will hit you bite you. They never go bed before 11pm. Alice never punishes them no matter what they do. I dont wish for that behavior around my 2.

Your house, your rules.

She and her partner chose to have the children they have and chose to become pregnant again so it is on them to find something that works for them to make sure the children are cared for\n\n**side note:**\n\n>BUT only when her bf (m33) says she can\n\n**HUGE red flag** for abuse here so I'd give a *bit* of slack on the kids being out of control and have concerns about your sister's safety and wellbeing.", "NTA.  You wouldn't be the AH for just saying no.  You definitely aren't for setting rules for it.", "NTA -Absolutely NTA. Your \u201chouse rules\u201d are extremely reasonable. If your sister & her kids don\u2019t want to follow them she can find another babysitter. I hope you know she is taking advantage of you.", "NTA \n\nIf she\u2019s telling you her kids don\u2019t have to follow your rules then she\u2019s telling them the same thing and that\u2019s just asking for trouble in your household. It would create issues for your family so it\u2019s a no go.", "NTA.  She created the problem, she can figure out a solution that doesn't involve you.  And make sure she knows that if they just drop them off you will be contacting authorities for child abandonment.  Time to cut them off.", "NTA. Alice sounds like she\u2019s slipped down the rabbit-hole of hands-off parenting\u2026.absolutely no way I\u2019d take on those kids unless there are MAJOR behavioral changes (which sounds unlikely).", "NTA.\n\n>Im sick of her only using me for a babysitter or trying to get money out of me.\n\nThat's why you need to be firm.\n\n>she stated that her kids dont have to follow what i say as they are HER kids not mine.

Having you keep her 3 kids for 4 nights is a big ask, and it\u2019s entirely appropriate for you to enforce reasonable rules and boundaries while her kids are with you to minimize the disruption to your own children and household.  If your sister doesn\u2019t want her kids following your rules, she can find a different babysitter.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. She doesn't get to abuse your kindness and then make demands.", "NTA but your sister is in an abusive situation and you may want to consider calling child services. Her bf is basically making it IMPOSSIBLE for her to leave. Yikes! Please stand firm on your boundaries and do not give her money. Hopefully, the hospital will see the signs of abuse when she goes to give birth and they will call the correct authorities to intervene in the situation.", "NTA. Honestly, your sister needs to stop popping out babies and raise the ones she has to behave and be decent kids instead of spoiled brats. \n\nIt\u2019s your house.

Her excuse is... hes there father she cant take them away from him. Iv tried telling her that she wouldn't be taking them away from him just that situation it would be the best thing for at less them kids. She sits and just laughs in your face when you point out all the bad the abuse and everything else about it all but she will only learn the hard way Unfortunately. I've tried countless times over the 10years shes been with him but she just tells me to jog on and stops speaking to me for a few months till shes desperate for money or a babysitter again.", "Unfortunately hes the dad of all her kids so its he has them and misses the birth of number 4 or they get someone else to watch them so he can be there for her and baby", "Why does it take 4 days though?

Learning to behave in public is so important to becoming a functional member of society. Thank you for teaching your kids how to get along with others and respect themselves.

I'm surprised you're willing to take her kids at all. They sound horrible. Up until 11pm? That's ridiculous.  Eating junk all night in front of your kids. No way.

You probably don't have to ask permission from your partner to speak with your siblings. You and your partner probably made a mutual decision around the use of birth control. Having a lot of kids isn't necessarily a sign of abuse. But if someone is pressured into having children they don't want, having sex when they don't want it, not being able to use birth control or having their birth control tampered with, that's abuse. If someone is in a controlling relationship where they have to ask permission to speak with their family, it's also possible that the controlling/abusive partner is pressuring them into having a lot of kids quickly to ensure they can't leave that relationship. Having a large family in and of itself is a perfectly fine life choice.", "[deleted]", "Okay. Since I've answered your question politely twice now and you have decided to react angrily and with accusations of abuse, I'm going to stop interacting with you. I hope you have a lovely day."]}
