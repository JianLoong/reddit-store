I was a bit surprised due to how depressed he seemed after my mom\u2019s death, but I supported him.\n\nAnd so two years ago, he introduced me to his now fianc\u00e9, someone I\u2019ll call Luke for this. Luke is nice, he\u2019s friendly and helps me out a lot, unfortunately Luke is 35 years old, only a year older than me. I was uncomfortable seeing a man my age and my father dating but I never brought it up since they were fairly private with it.\n\nThe big problem arrived just a week ago, we were having family dinner, I had prepared everything, including our traditional food that took me days to actually finish, I served my father and Luke and my girlfriend before sitting down. \n\nThat\u2019s when my father announced he and his partner were engaged, I wasn\u2019t that happy, since I never agreed or approved of their relationship, not that I said so, so maybe that\u2019s my mistake. \n\nI asked if I could talk to my dad and we went into my room. I told him it was wildly inappropriate to have a relationship with someone the same age as his daughter, he pointed out how Luke was older but I simply told him how grossed out I feel seeing them have to kiss and now I have to see them get married.\n\nWe argued, he said some hurtful things that made me cry and then I also brought up hurtful things that made him storm out.\n\nLuke left after him after he apologized to me and my girlfriend while thanking us for the meal, which made me feel guilty. \n\nI told my girlfriend what had happened and she says we should talk it out and maybe I was being too rude, I disagreed but now it\u2019s been a week and my dad has been a bit cold with me.\n\nWas I in the wrong? AITA?\n\nEdit 3: this will be the last, I apologize but no update will be added. I believe the comments have gotten too uncivil for my tastes and I do not wish to feel worst as I\u2019ve already been feeling.\n\nI will talk to my father and apologize and after their wedding I will cut contact with both him and Luke, who is lovely by the way. \n\nThank you all for your feedback, I will attempt to mature and be less childish, as I\u2019ve already admitted to. I am sorry for bothering you all with this post and my replies, I didn\u2019t wish to come off as rude or immature, I sincerely apologize and appreciate everyone\u2019s feedback.\n\nI won\u2019t delete this account until I decide if I will write an update or not but I am leaning on no.\n\nSorry for the dreadfully long post, bye!", "created_utc": 1686357411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145lt23/aita_for_disapproving_of_my_fathers_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, but I think the comments are digging into her way too much. She\u2019s possibly traumatized and has complicated feelings regarding her father. Implying she is jealous or being insecure is blatantly false since this is clearly a more serious issue than a kid throwing a tantrum(and someone implying she might be homophobic??).\n\nTo OP.\nYTA for this *sole* interaction, but your father is the worst for laying his hands on you and being a horrible partner/boyfriend to your mother.\n\nEDIT: also, many people brushed off how OP\u2019s father made her cry, which could be unimportant, but judging from his stated previous actions and behaviors, this man still sucks to this day.", "Ok this is long but I personally think NTA based off the post AND the responses OP has given. Luke is a consenting adult and it isnt OPs right to approve their relationship. That being said, based off how OPs father cheated multiple times on OPs mom and how he has a history of being violently physical, as well as being desaproving of OPs sexuality when she came out, then I understand why OP would react negatively towards her father making such a comitment as marriage and with someone of the same sex. I personally would have limited contact just to make sure Luke is alright even after marriage just based of the fathers history. Again this is based off the info I have found on responses and the post. It's possible OPs father might have been copying what he saw growing up and he might have started changing after OP came out or Luke came around. Either way OP has not gotten to truly talk about how she felt when her father came out to her after having reacted so badly to her coming out and then having to adjust to seeing her father in such a committed  relationship than what she was used to. I do think OP should have a sit down with her father as well as a mediator like, their partners, and have OP tell her father how she felt throughout the past couple of years or how she feels about the current situation. Sorry for the long post and I'm sorry to OP for the people who have reacted really negatively in the comments, you're entitled to your emotions especially with the history you have with your father and I'm sorry if the comments made you're feelings seem less. Also I understand some comments might have not seen OPs responses which would make the story seem different. Again I don't think YTA for feeling the way you do which to me, justify your actions, that being said without the context of your history I do think you're at the very least, in the wrong.", "NTA at all. I would not apologize to your father about anything, sounds like he\u2019s done nothing to deserve an apology.", "You know what, I\u2019ve decided to comment again, since I think my last one wasn\u2019t that good.\n\nI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m going against the majority but: NTA.\n\nOPs dad, who is almost 60, has decided to date a man only a year older than his daughter. Said daughter has been only queer and from OPs replies, her father hurt her physically when she came out. So, of course she would hold resentment over it, especially if he suddenly comes out as queer as well despite showing he was(or is)bigoted.\n\nThen, we have the fact that this man was never married to OPs mother, who he was depressed about, but apparently cheated on repeatedly with younger women(this man already has a pattern of young partners). So, her father having a young partner, would of course disgust her and being back memories of his cheating days. And suddenly he\u2019s ready to settle down with this guy too? I bet Luke is lovely, but I do not blame OP.\n\n And then, we have the fact OP went no contact with her father for a time before reconnecting, so no matter how long it\u2019s been, it will be hard to navigate their relationship, and then this man starts dating someone only a year(or even a few months)older than his own daughter and is engaged after a few years.\n\nThis man has shown himself to be disloyal, abusive and generally a big AH. \nOP is NTA, I genuinely don\u2019t care if she should just \u2018be happy for him\u2019, because she has a right to be traumatized and her trauma should be validated.\n\nA lot of people in the comment section is simply bashing her and not even taking in account her trauma and what she might be feeling, and we do not know what her father told OP to make her cry(interesting how it\u2019s only OP who was being \u2018mean\u2019). Some comments are also borderline victim blaming and kissing OPs dad\u2019s ass.\n\nThe dad is the asshole, OP deserves better and Luke, he sounds nice so far, should probably run.", "i don\u2019t really know what to say other than your father sounds gross and nasty op", "[deleted]", "NTA. We should respect our icks for whatever reason and it's ok to upset the family members while expressing our opinions. They'll most probably survive.", "I have a hard time saying YTA for this but I do think you\u2019re in the wrong. I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from as it must be incredibly off putting to see your dad with someone your age but as long as it\u2019s a well intentioned relationship there shouldn\u2019t be a problem with it. I would think it\u2019s a good thing your dad is able to move on and find another partner and honestly it\u2019s someone in their mid 30s, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s dating a 19 year old", "NTA\n\nDamn, I\u2019m genuinely surprised that in this case the age gap is not a problem because in this sub it\u2019s always the problem. According the information in your responses your father is hypocrite and bad person in general. Don\u2019t apologize and go NC with him. You owe him nothing. He is the one who should apologize to you.", "I don't really blame you. I'd be disgusted as well if my mother when after someone my age. Though I'm grateful she's married to someone her own age.", "YTA. It\u2019s pretty clear you don\u2019t have actual issues with Luke and you\u2019re grasping at straws to complain about him. Your father sounds happy - that\u2019s a good thing.", "YTA. Your father doesn\u2019t need your approval or agreement. It sounds like Luke is lovely and you\u2019re just looking for a reason to make your father miserable.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Your dad is happy again and he doesn't need your approval. It sounds like you don't want him to be happy and he has to be miserable for the rest of his life\n\nThere is one thing, and one thing only, that matters: is he happy? Act accordingly.", "YTA - What did you think you'd gain by stating your feelings after the engagement announcement? They are adults who decided they want to integrate their lives.\n\nIf the age issue was your critical concern it should have been discussed prior. Sounds like you side stepped it until their relationship solidified.", "YTA\n\nI get it must be super weird that your dad's dating someone near enough your age \n\nBut they're adults, and your dad's happy \n\nYour dad's being cold to you but he's still communicating, maybe sit down together again and explain why this took you off guard", "YTA.  They've been together for two years.  They're clearly committed to each other.    \n\n\nAfter being incredibly depressed after your mom died, your dad is happy again.  Can't you just be happy that he's happy?", "YTA\n\nYou waited until the wrong time to have this discussion. At the end of the day, though, you have no real control over who your dad dates/marries.", "YTA- he didnt ask for you to agree or for your approval, he gave you the courtesy of letting you know they're engaged. Taking him aside how you did and as if you have any say or control over his love life was completely inappropriate and childish.", "YTA. It's not your place to approve or disapprove. It appears you're jealous, tbh", "YTA.  Mind your own fricking business.", "YTA - they\u2019ve been dating for years. They are clearly happy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You lost your mom, but he lost a life partner. It's normal for people to want companionship. \n\nYour dad is in a relationship with a consenting adult. It's freaking gross that you're acting like it's so horrible and gross. Yeah it's weird that his fiance is a year old, but there is only a 20 year age difference.

If he\u2019s happy, than you should support him. Simple as that.", "I think the thing that makes YTA is how you went about your feelings, while I get where you're coming from, being uncomfortable because you're close to your father's fiance's age, I think you shouldn't have been to harsh and essentially called their relationship 'gross', plus, your father's happy to have met someone that fills the void in his heart and makes him happy, to the point they got engaged, and Luke seems like a nice loveky person. You should've definitely talked with your dad and settle your feelings, I think you should give them a chance", "YTA\n\nI might vote differently if Luke was, say, 25. But he isn't.
