Your wife is aware of this and needs to understand that friendships need to be prioritised once in awhile. It is healthy for you and also your marriage.", "NTA. You have been doing this trip for years. No girls allowed, I get it. If your wife comes, you're going to have her on your mind, and the baby. It will take away from the experience of your trip. I'm assuming the reason you do it in different cities is to get far away from the partners, and her veing close would kill that freedom vibe.", "NTA - She has had some friend weekends away (the work trips DO NOT count though) where you were parenting alone. Now it is your turn to go away with your friends. \n\nI also don't see why she needs to visit her friend THIS weekend. Its not like the portal to wherever she lives is only open this weekend. If she wants to plans a girls weekend with her friend or a trip for you/her/your kid to visit her friend, that is a separate conversation. \n\nThe only reason I see for her wanting to do this weekend in particular is because she doesn't want to spend the weekend at home alone with your kid. Which would be BS, because you did it for when she went on bachelorette trips.", "NTA - She\u2019s infringing far too much here. I could see if there weren\u2019t kids involved and you separated after the flights to be with your friends. She\u2019s very clearly missing the entire point here. She can go visit her bff alone, and you can be home with the cub.", "NTA- if she gets weekends away with her friends and you are home taking care of things, then its is fine.", "I was so prepared to call you an ass and just be like yall can travel together and let her spend the weekend with her friend. But going with NTA because you have a kid. That completely changes everything and it's not a guys weekend anymore.", "NTA. She can visit the friend another time, separately.   \n\nOR, If she\u2019s bringing your little one along, then she shouldn\u2019t plan to be having ragers with her friend where you need to watch her, and the kid.  And if she wants time for the kid to see \u2018aunty\u2019, then, that\u2019s what they do.  You aren\u2019t responsible for any serious parenting time as it\u2019s technically your weekend away, which she gets from the sounds of it", "NTA obviously", "NTA for wanting a weekend with the guys...\n\nReddit is going to rip you a new one for this line, though:\n\n> It's been a He-Man woman haters club just for the weekend.\n\nI get the sentiment, like \"No Girls Allowed\" sign, but my guy... have you ever been on reddit before? This is just ASKING for abuse.", "NTA\n\nShe gets her weekends away. You should get yours.", "NTA, you should both be able to have your weekends, but I don't really see why you can't say: look, I am going to be busy literally the entire weekend. As long as you understand that, and you understand that I'm not looking after our son or coming to pick you up when you get drunk, etc, you have to be responsible for everything, then sure come, and you'll do your trip, and I'll do my trip.", "NAH, but there's no reason you can't travel together and then you split off at the airport to have entirely separate plans when you get there and meet back at the airport on the tail end.", "NAH, you can both travel there but do separate things. She hasn\u2019t stated she wants to spend the time with you so you need to actually talk to her not randoms on the internet", "NTA enjoy your weekend. No need to turn this trip into a family trip.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t she fly out for a separate weekend to see her friend?", "Info- can't she stay with her friend, you with your boys and just share each other's company for the travel-time?", "\u201cIn the past girlfriends have tagged along occasionally\u201d \u2026 \u201cin the last few years we have KIND OF made it more focused on a guy\u2019s weekend\u201d. I call BS. I think the OP is relaying the story to stack the odds in his favor. One of his arguments for her not coming is that she parties with her friend. (He SUPPOSES that she would, she doesn\u2019t say that she wants to. She said she wants to introduce her kid to her friend. Doesn\u2019t sound like a 10kegger kind of experience to me) Again BS argument. Something doesn\u2019t smell right. \n\nListen, if it is as he tries to say \u2026 he is NTA. Everyone has a right to take a weekend away with old friends if that is what the couple agrees to do. That being said\u2026 the OP can\u2019t get upset if the wife buys another hotel room and goes to have her own \u201cgirl\u2019s weekend\u201d with her friend (with the kid). She surely deserves the same and I think that\u2019s the obvious solution.", "YTA for the sentence \"It's been a He-Man woman haters club just for the weekend.\" Gross.\n\nThat said, you're implying here that your wife would not be able to stick to some ground rules. Is that really true? If she joined you but did not stick to those rules (for instance, if she makes you babysit) then that would make her the AH. But right now I'm leaning toward YTA because you are assuming that it would be impossible for you and your wife to be in the same city enjoying separate things.", "\"It's been a He-Man woman haters club just for the weekend\"\n\nYTA for that alone.\n\nYou could have reached a compromise with your wife where you could share accomodations and she is solely responsible for you son and can visit her friend, but you clearly don't want to. You're entitled to weekends with friends, just as she is, but there's no reason the two of you can't have weekends with friends while staying at the same hotel and traveling together but spending your days separately. She wasn't asking to hang out with you and your friends.", "Before I can reach a verdict, what happened when you told her?", ">Between a couple of her work trips and bachelorette weekends in the past year where I was single dad, I feel I have earned a weekend where she is single mom.\n\nDepend. Work trips can be exhausting, with people you don't particularly like and without really enough time to do anything fun. Or they can be work for 8 hours and then fun time each night with coworker that are friend in a cool city.\n\nYou were responsible for the kids everyday for the whole year, no day with friend, no day without any responsibility for the kids? I mean it's possible, but it's peculiar. Most of us have a day from time to time without any responsibility for the kids and we try to balanced it between us and our spouse. My point is that you shouldn't count only full weekend, you count how many full days and half day you each had to yourself and figure out if it balance out or not. If you had a lot less you time than her, then yes you have a point.\n\nCouldn't you guys reach a compromise? For example, maybe you take care of the kid either Friday or Sunday night, but the other two nights (whatever which two you prefer) would be for you with your friends. That way she can party with her friend one night and then still spend the weekend with her friend and your kids while you have fun with your friends.", "A he-man woman haters club? You lost me here", ">It's been a He-Man woman haters club just for the weekend.\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm thinking YTA or ESH. Why not just talk to your wife and set out some ground rules for the weekend. I don't see why you couldn't travel to the same place but spend your time there separate. You go do your thing with your boys, and your wife can go hang out with your son and her friend. \n\nYou also said that you've been doing these weekends for ten years and it sounds like she has never tagged along before. What's wrong with her tagging along the one time you guys are visiting the city where her friend lives?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
