You did the right thing.  Your sister may have some mental issues.", "NTA. Personal opinion here, but I would suggest you distance yourself from your sister to save yourself from the 2nd hand embarrassment. I'm just a random internet person but the 2nd hand cringe I'd feel for being related to someone who acts this way would be a bit much for an introvert like me to handle.

You DID give her an advanced warning and she still chose to show her ass, embarrassing you in front of your family and friends so she doesn\u2019t deserve your empathy. Weddings are stressful under even the best conditions. It\u2019s a time when all the attention should be focused on you and your partner and the commitment you\u2019re making together. It\u2019s not about her or her selfish need for attention. You handled it beautifully and with grace. Tell her to consider this a 2nd and final warning: if she behaves like a petulant child during the wedding or reception your groomsmen will be ready and waiting to put her in her place - an Uber ride home. \nGood luck and congratulations!!", "NTA- she\u2019s gonna ruin your wedding.", "NTA. Don't let her come to the wedding!", "NTA.\n\n1. You did give her a warning. You did sit her down and told her what exactly she isn't supposed to do. And she did that anyway.

People who create scenes and upstage special events get kicked out. That's the rule. I don't see how much more gracefully you could have handled this situation.\n\n3. This is your engagement party. It should not be and is not a content source for Miss Influencer.", "NTA I am wondering, if your sister can't even behave for an engagement dinner, how bad will the actual wedding be?

She made herself a spectacle for no reason, embarrassed you, and decided basic restaurant etiquette didn\u2019t apply to her. I\u2019m not sure really sure why a grown woman needs a warning to please not stand on her chair?

At my engagement dinner you did X, Y, Z all because you want to become an influencer. Instead of acting like a normal person you made false claims about the waiter, who was just doing the job he was paid to do, bullying you and then you hand a tantrum when you were called out on it until you had to be escorted off property. GROW UP. \"\n\nYour response will gain traction.", ">I could have given her a warning instead of kicking her immediately out\n\nI doubt it would have made a difference, based on her description. She'd have ignored this warning too, OP would still have to get her kicked out, and the social media rantings would have followed.", ">She made herself a spectacle for no reason\n\nMaking herself a spectacle *was* the reason. She's an attention seeker.  The spotlight always has to be on her.  \n\nNTA, but I would echo the other comments here warning the OP about what she is going to pull at her wedding.", "Or worse\u2026 a red dress\u2026 definitely have something handy\u2026", "I\u2019m saving this post just so I can see that update when it comes!", "I like this idea! Have a phone check at the wedding, similar to a coat check. Everyone leaves their phone at the door and they get it back when they leave. If it a rule for everyone, she can\u2019t say you are singling her out and she won\u2019t have the opportunity to make a scene", "Yes, like some others posts here about acti ng up before weddings, I recommend extra security.  NTA", "Do you have a link?", "I remember that. It was so bad", "Well you can bring the wine if she pulls up in white and I have a few bottles of black and blue inks", "There are way too many people who need to be available - parents whose children are with babysitters; EMTs/doctors on call... you get the idea....   A phone check just doesn't work.", "They only need to check her phone. But she'll probably throw a fit and post that instead of whatever staged stunt she had planned.", "Not on hand, but search here or in BORU for \"AITA red dress\", I can't remember how she worded it, but OP went to her exes wedding and painted his new wife in a bad light... until she admits the dress was \"like\" an Amazon link she shared that led to a dress that said right there plain as day \"red beach wedding dress\"", "AITA for showing up at my ex\u2019s wedding in a pretty dress?\n\nFor the picture look at the user's profile \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1053aix/aita_for_showing_up_at_my_exs_wedding_in_a_pretty/", "[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1053aix/aita_for_showing_up_at_my_exs_wedding_in_a_pretty/)\n\nAll of the comments on the original point out that it's clearly a wedding dress\n\nEdited to add [the bride's POV](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/105s1ki/my_wedding_was_ruined_by_a_jealous_ex_and_she/) since I can't find the BORU", "You\u2019re the kinda clutch friend everyone needs to have", "That\u2019s too bad, but understandable! I would definitely find a way to lock up her phone if she wants an invite though! Your day is about you and your fianc\u00e9! Best of luck!"]}
