I just read this and I'm already sick of your sister.\n2. You should have given her a warning? WTF does she think what you told her ahead of time was?\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Not at all.  You did the right thing.  Your sister may have some mental issues.", "NTA. Personal opinion here, but I would suggest you distance yourself from your sister to save yourself from the 2nd hand embarrassment. I'm just a random internet person but the 2nd hand cringe I'd feel for being related to someone who acts this way would be a bit much for an introvert like me to handle. She acted out of line for being asked a simple request to not stand on a chair, she disregarded her \"warning\".", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is extremely selfish. You DID give her an advanced warning and she still chose to show her ass, embarrassing you in front of your family and friends so she doesn\u2019t deserve your empathy. Weddings are stressful under even the best conditions. It\u2019s a time when all the attention should be focused on you and your partner and the commitment you\u2019re making together. It\u2019s not about her or her selfish need for attention. You handled it beautifully and with grace. Tell her to consider this a 2nd and final warning: if she behaves like a petulant child during the wedding or reception your groomsmen will be ready and waiting to put her in her place - an Uber ride home. \nGood luck and congratulations!!", "NTA- she\u2019s gonna ruin your wedding.", "NTA. Don't let her come to the wedding!", "NTA.\n\n1. You did give her a warning. You did sit her down and told her what exactly she isn't supposed to do. And she did that anyway. So this is not on you.\n\n2. If a waiter had to come over and ask her to sit down, it is very evident that she was in fact creating a scene. People who create scenes and upstage special events get kicked out. That's the rule. I don't see how much more gracefully you could have handled this situation.\n\n3. This is your engagement party. It should not be and is not a content source for Miss Influencer.", "NTA I am wondering, if your sister can't even behave for an engagement dinner, how bad will the actual wedding be? Maybe you shouldn't have instantly kicked her out, but she ignored your request, so she brought this jpon herself.", "NTA. Your sister sounds exhausting. I would escalate and say she not take pictures at all (at least on her phone) to future events since her judgment about what is \"above and beyond\" is clearly lacking.", "NTA\n\nYou warned her. You even took the time to sit her down and explain.", "NTA\n\nThis is exactly what she wanted.\n\nI'd rethink having her be involved in your wedding.", "NTA.  It sounds to me that you did exactly the right thing, gracefully and emphatically threw her out.", "NTA. Something tells me she is unbothered by the drama she started.", "I wish you luck at your wedding....", "NTA What kind of warning were you supposed to give her? How were you supposed to know that she was going to go off the deep end and do what she did? She embarrassed herself. If one is going to act like a child then one gets treated like a child. That was your sister.", "NTA she got her warning when you asked her to control herself like an adult. There\u2019s no reason she couldn\u2019t go a dinner without posting.", "NTA and I suggest that if she attends your wedding, it's under the condition that she give up any device with a camera & access to social media to an agreed upon third party for the duration of the event. If she screams about bullying for being asked to stop acting out in public, I wouldn't put it past her to make a scene on purpose the day of your nuptials.", "NTA.  You might want to ban her from the wedding.  I don't even want to imagine what drama she'll try to cause there.", "NTA\n\nIt was your wedding day - where the hell was your sister's grace and empathy? If your sister is over 18, there's no excuse for crying over not getting her way.\n\nUgh. Your sister sounds like an absolute nightmare. I'm so sorry you have to deal with such a pill.", "YTA. She wasn't doing any harm.", "NTA. She\u2019s an attention addict - and the sort that always makes herself out to be the victim when she knows she was the one who effed up. $20 says she finds a way to pull this type of sh!t at your wedding if she attends.", "Definitely NTA. She made herself a spectacle for no reason, embarrassed you, and decided basic restaurant didn\u2019t apply to her. I\u2019m not sure really sure why a grown woman needs a warning to please not stand on her chair? And plus she caused a scene and argued like a spoiled baby when the waiter tried to ask her nicely to stop.", "Well, that probably could have been handled more gracefully, but you gave her plenty of warning. It sounds like she's lost her compass a bit. NTA", "NTA your sister is definitely an attention seeker even before the whole online influencer thing does she have a history of trying to steal the spotlight from others in the past.", "NTA\n\nYou warned her ahead of time because you know her. She doesn't care, your warnings mean nothing to her. She is a self-centered narcissist. \n\nThe looming problem is the wedding. The nagging fear of what she is going to do would make me so anxious.  I say uninvite her now so she can get all her victim drama out before the wedding,", "NTA your sister has a bad case of chronically online syndrome", "NTA, your sister needs to seek professional help. Don't invite her to the wedding", "Nta and are we sure she should come to the wedding\u2026just saying. With that behavior good luck", "NTA. Better to nip this in the bud now, than to have to address it at your wedding.", "NTA. I\u2019d also uninvite her from the wedding too", "NTA - The waiter asking her to sit down was her warning. Getting kicked out was a natural consequence. \n\nI mean if she had been standing on a chair to get the perfect pic of the happy couple for you, maybe I\u2019d give her a pass. But fighting over a pic of her food and drawing attention away from the occasion? That\u2019s rude.", "Disrespect and cry bully at a service worker trying to save a wedding in an attempt to get internet famous at her sister's expense? I'd have both you and the sister escorted out.", "We found the sister!", "Standing on a chair? Arguing with the server? Sobbing? You cannot be serious.

That ones on OP.", "She's lItErAlLy making a scene at a wedding. Get off the chair. She needed her ego bruised a bit. OP's sour cuz she's pulling the same stunt he knew she would. The only thing on OP is they shouldn't have invited her to the wedding at all. She's lucky they showed more grace than me.", "OP knows how hard their sister is working to become Internet famous. What happened to family supporting family?", "The only support left at that wedding is the chair holding her up", "You clearly dont see it the way I see it. This is pointless.", "Maybe try a bird's eye view next time, like from a chair", "I suggest you forcibly take her cellphone at the wedding or ban her altogether. She sounds exhausting.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I hope you have that waiter an excellent tip for having to deal with her nonsense.", "NTA, it'd be one thing to \"forget herself in the moment\" but she definitively became TA when she started arguing with the waiter, etc. Sounds like an exhausting person to have in your family.", "NTA. You DID give her a warning. She just failed to heed it.", "NTA", "NTA Your sister needs professional help.", "NTA- some things are just so over the top there is no need for a warning. Standing on a chair, arguing with a waiter, and making a scene is one of those things. Your sister was rude, selfish, and inappropriate. If she can\u2019t recognize that she was out of line, that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. Your life isn\u2019t her content. She can get married and take photos.", "NTA. What the actual hell is wrong with your sister?", "NTA.\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nYour sister is extremely obnoxious, and borderline obsessed with an online image.\n\nThat is not okay.\n\nHonestly, and I don't know how to go about this, she needs to get help with this because it sounds like she's addicted to social media.\n\nYou asked her not to do her usual thing. You specifically told her to be calm for the day. It was NOT too much to ask.\n\nShe completely disregarded that request and acted selfish and annoying.\n\nI apologise for calling her out like that, but I feel it's important to point this out.\n\nBut more than all of that...\n\nI hope your wedding was amazing. It sounds like you're really happy, and that makes me, some random person on the internet, smile.\n\nCongratulations!!", "NTA, and if I were you I'd seriously consider uninviting her to the wedding. She's already shown you that she can't be trusted to behave in public, even after talking to her about it in advance. What if she decides to stand on a chair and argue with staff while you're walking down the aisle?", "NTA. You DID warn her. You told her before the event even happened.", "NTA", "A waiter came and asked her sit down? Is she a toddler?", "Asshole or not you did the right OP as a brother of a less intense sister but still equally a pain I\u2019d have done the same thing. NTA", "NTA. And I\u2019ll say it again when you post here after exposing her persona and lies. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t be such a shitty person lol. She will 100% ruin your wedding too. Act now unless you want a repeat. Also, you acted decisively, manipulative people hate that. No, you could not have handled it differently.", "NTA - I wonder what she\u2019ll do at the wedding, my money is on either wearing white or something otherwise inappropriate.", "Wow. Such main character energy. NTA and maybe think about putting in some rules for your wedding. If this is how she acts at your engagement dinner, God knows what she'll be like at the wedding", "NTA", "NTA - social media influencers need to learn the world doesn\u2019t resolve around them.", "NTA but you will be if you let her attend your wedding. There *will* be drama if she's present, especially after you've had her removed for already ignoring your warning.", "NTA sister needs a j o b", "You may want to confiscate her phone for the wedding. Get one of the phone safes that locks for a few hours. Without a link to social, she might behave normally at the ceremony and part of the reception.", "NTA. \n\nShe was already kind of warned when you asked her not to do anything that might embarrass you at *your* engagement party.

Sis needs some therapy.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t invite her to your wedding", "omg ur sister sounds sooo annoying! i bet she will try to make the wedding all about her too.", "NTA.

She thrives on it.", "It wasn\u2019t even the wedding day, but the engagement party.", "NTA - then she got the second warning from the server!! She chose to ignore the first warning and argue about the second. This is all on her. Choices have consequences.", "I want to stand on all of your chairs.", "She's standing on a chair in a public place to take pictures of *food* after being specifically warned against behaving poorly.

That's not tryna live her life, that's trying to commandeer everyone else's for a few more followers.", "Red wine won't work, some wedding dresses are red- like the story of the ex who showed up in a red beach wedding dress\n\nToss some black pen ink instead", "*They\u2019ll have to confiscate her phone and put it in a lock box.*\n\n\nAnd escort her out while she kicks, screams and fake cries.
