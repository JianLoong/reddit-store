You did the right thing.  Your sister may have some mental issues.", "NTA. Personal opinion here, but I would suggest you distance yourself from your sister to save yourself from the 2nd hand embarrassment. I'm just a random internet person but the 2nd hand cringe I'd feel for being related to someone who acts this way would be a bit much for an introvert like me to handle. She acted out of line for being asked a simple request to not stand on a chair, she disregarded her \"warning\".", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is extremely selfish. You DID give her an advanced warning and she still chose to show her ass, embarrassing you in front of your family and friends so she doesn\u2019t deserve your empathy. Weddings are stressful under even the best conditions. It\u2019s a time when all the attention should be focused on you and your partner and the commitment you\u2019re making together. It\u2019s not about her or her selfish need for attention. You handled it beautifully and with grace. Tell her to consider this a 2nd and final warning: if she behaves like a petulant child during the wedding or reception your groomsmen will be ready and waiting to put her in her place - an Uber ride home. \nGood luck and congratulations!!", "NTA- she\u2019s gonna ruin your wedding.\n\nThought on this some more\u2026 you\u2019ll feel bad and beg her to behave like a human.

You did sit her down and told her what exactly she isn't supposed to do. And she did that anyway. So this is not on you.\n\n2. If a waiter had to come over and ask her to sit down, it is very evident that she was in fact creating a scene. People who create scenes and upstage special events get kicked out. That's the rule. I don't see how much more gracefully you could have handled this situation.\n\n3. This is your engagement party. It should not be and is not a content source for Miss Influencer.", "NTA I am wondering, if your sister can't even behave for an engagement dinner, how bad will the actual wedding be?

She wasn't doing any harm.", "NTA. She\u2019s an attention addict - and the sort that always makes herself out to be the victim when she knows she was the one who effed up. $20 says she finds a way to pull this type of sh!t at your wedding if she attends.", "Definitely NTA. She made herself a spectacle for no reason, embarrassed you, and decided basic restaurant etiquette didn\u2019t apply to her. I\u2019m not sure really sure why a grown woman needs a warning to please not stand on her chair?

You DID give her a warning. She just failed to heed it.", "NTA", "NTA Your sister needs professional help.", "NTA- some things are just so over the top there is no need for a warning.

She, however is. \n\nBan her from the wedding because without a single doubt she will try to knock the priest over to get a better photo op for her social media.", "NTA she is an attention seeker, so think if you want to invite her in the wedding the drama that she certainly will create, its better if you keep your distance.", "I can't stand these self-obsessed \"influencers\". I live in NYC and the acts that I've witnessed are horrendous. \n\nI go out of my way to not walk by the 9/11 memorial because I want to beat the shit out of 25% of the people performing disgusting, disrespectful acts there for social media. \n\nAnyone that follows these useless people is clearly uneducated. Pick real role models that are worthy of their fame and intelligence!", ">She says that I could have given her a warning instead of kicking her immediately out\n\nYou did though. She was told ahead of time not to pull some shit. Then she was warned by the staff to sit down and act right and she argued. \n\nShe has a deeply unhealthy relationship with social media to the extent that I wonder if this was staged or exaggerated just so she could have a social media of how she was treated oh so poorly. Meaning I think she knew what she was doing and knew what would happen and wanted it to happen so she would have something to complain about.", "NTA but make sure you have a designated \"sister handler\" for your wedding.  Guaranteed that she'll be \"that girl\" and make a scene.", "so she's the parents favorite and OP is not but OP is NTA.  I hope you don't invite her to be in your wedding party.", "OP should counter her social media post with you were warned. You embarrassed yourself and got yourself kicked out. Please be responsible for your own action... \n\nI like confrontation though.", "I advise OP to disinvite her sister altogether or have someone assigned to babysit her for the duration of the event to keep her from acting out. I would just not at all trust her to act right on her own at this point.", "Except she wanted to get kicked out. Then she is the victim.", "Look, I see where you're coming from, as being annoying and attention-seeking AF does not necessarily mean you're doing anyone any harm. But there are many reasons why one should not stand on chairs in restaurants and it could have indeed led to harm to herself, others, and the restaurant. Imagine if she had fallen and injured herself and/or others? There could have been hospital visits and lawsuits. At the very least the restaurant could lose business, as customers don't tend to come to an upscale restaurant and pay for expensive meals to see dive bar behavior going on around them.", "My sister in law showed up at my wedding in a white lace mini length dress. It was so short I\u2019m happy she waxes. I didn\u2019t act like I noticed but thought my mom and mother I. Law were going to have heart attacks.", "Charcoal dust is good too. Grind it to a powder or pull some from the bottom of the bag. Red wine will splash anything and anyone nearby and cause stains on the venue floor. We don't want the bride and groom billed for this. Charcoal can be swept or washed away but still effective enough to make your point. \n\nI've also heard colored glitter but thats more of a \"Oh you want attention? Here you go\" kind of thing to throw on someone. Makes em stick out like a disco ball.", "Chris Rock's new special has a couple great moments - one of which is about how everyone is a victim.   He said our emotional emergency room is filled with MFers with paper cuts - we won't have the capacity to care for the people with actual needs.", "This should be the top comment. She should be searched at the entrance for any electronic equipment.", "I wish this was higher up. This is exactly what needs to be done.", "I had a joke with some friends that all the ushers and bridesmaids would be issued with water guns full of overly strong Kool Aid. And there will be a wide variety of colors, including dark purple! Who cares if it looks like an accident, anyone who pulls a prank should have one pulled on them!\n\nIt was just a joke but we really enjoyed it!", "I remember that one!", "How many times do I have to tell people? Hire teenagers with paintball guns!", "Ooh, that's a really good idea. A good friend of mine is engaged and her and her fianc\u00e9 are saving up for the wedding, and as far as I know she hasn't decided yet in what color she wants to get married in and my best friend and me already said if she marries in white and someone decideds to come in a white dress we won't be sorry for spilling red wine over them.", "A tranq gun?", "Don't punish everyone for her bad behaviour. You have a legitimate reason to be concerned, that doesn't need any further justification. I'd just tell her now that because of her actions here, she is only invited to your wedding if she hands in her phone (and anything else that records) beforehand. If she doesn't like that, she can stay home. But beware of a smuggled phone or her enlisting an accomplice.", "How about a rule that anyone who was kicked out of the engagement party for phone use has to check their phone during the wedding? It's still a \"neutral\" rule. That way nobody has to give up their phone unnecessarily. \n\nI agree that people can  live without their phones for a little while, and we used to leave the number of the venue so that people could call it in a real emergency (I was a babysitter in the '80s). But I don't see the need to require people to do that just to make this sister feel like it's fair. It doesn't seem fair to me to punish everyone just because the sister can't behave.\n\nA wedding reception is long and I don't think it is very disruptive to check your phone, use it for regular photos, or even dip out of the wedding from time to time to call and check in with your loved ones if that's what someone wants to do. People's presence is not required the entire time, especially if they are not a central figure.", "Yup. Me too. Two of them were so occupied with their content making they walked right into my toddler... I was quick enough to grab him and pull him away. They didn't even apologized just kept walking and taking photos of themselves. They had the attitude like how my son dares to exist there when they are there... It was at entrance to our apartment complex in which they don't live...", "A couple bottles of black/brown india ink and a puke green very unflattering backup dress in the trunk of the car. She can either wear the stained mess or the other monstrosity, or she can leave.", "They work very well when squirted from spray bottles\u2026", "Did she not care she made herself look like an absolute idiot lol. I couldn't imagine doing that at any of my brothers weddings and they wouldn't even invite me if I acted like that lol. My bro who has a girl puts her 1st when it comes to the rest of the family (aside from their kids) and I've told him before never feel bad for that, she's your girl and the mother of your babies, she should cone first so yea he wouldn't tolerate any disrespect towards his partner.", "I see you're living up to your username", "Well, if she tries that narrative online, there\u2019ll be a wedding full of witnesses to spread the real story.", "I like your choice of colour. And make it frilly with laces and beads to give it more of a pukey look", "That\u2019s assuming she had any to lose initially", "NTA. Her warning was the staff asking her to get off the chair. When you refuse orders, you get kicked out. Natural consequences. Not about you at all. Just tell her that her behavior presented a safety risk, and she was asked to stop and refused. Done. She\u2019s lucky police weren\u2019t called, or security.", "NTA  And I would rescind her wedding invite. She might make some noise online about it, but better to have her misbehave at home rather than at your wedding.", "NTA\nYou did warn her ahead of time.", "No. NTA. She has to be disciplined during a dinner like the one you guys had and she couldn't even keep herself from taking photos of food for her little social media account. I can understand everyone wants to become famous, but that's not the way to do it. Put the damn phone down for the dinner and post like 60 photos after the dinner is over because well, for her, the \"backlog\" is rising.", "NTA - your wedding will become her social media spectacle as you can bet she will start something.  Uninvite her before this gets out of hand.", "NTA\n\nShe's a massive attention seeker.", "NTA. If she was my sister, Id make a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d account to show  how ridiculous she is. Show her standing on the chair (before kicking her out). Show her with 2 plates of food. Etc.", "She got her warning at the restaurant when she was escorted out. She better tone it down for your wedding.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all! Though honestly I think you might have just given her what she wants. Clearly she just wants attention and some drama to talk about with her followers, and this is what she's doing.\n\nAt the wedding, you might consider giving her a dedicated chaperon and maybe placing her in the least noticeable place in the hall. Maybe at the very back corner or something so that it's harder for her to make a big scene at the wedding. You could always uninvite her, but that might be worse cause by the sounds of it she will definitely make a huge deal out of it and try to turn people against you for it. She can't complain (as much) if all you do is move her as far from the spotlight as possible.", "NTA. You did give her a warning. Ahead of time!", "NTA. I highly recommend banning her from taking photos at your wedding.", "NTA. She cares for nothing accept her online presence. I would tell her she\u2019s not invited to the wedding either. He behavior is completely unacceptable and I\u2019m sure she will do the same thing at your wedding.", "NTA. You DID give her a warning, and she chose not to heed it. She FAFO'd.", "You did give her a warning when you asked her not to behave that way.", "NTA. People like OP\u2019s sister are why we can\u2019t have nice things.", "NTA. You did give her a warning in private before the event. It's not your fault she wasn't listening. And think of what she'd pull at your wedding if you backed down and didn't make it clear you were willing to enforce your boundaries. (In fact, you may want to assign someone to follow her around at your wedding to be her conscience and remind her in the moment when she's about to cross a line)", "NTA. Your sister is an ego centric nightmare. Period.", "NTA - think long and hard before inviting her to the wedding", "Wasn't the sit down the warning?  I'd take her camera away for the wedding or uninvite her.  Could even threaten her with suing if she posts anything to do with the wedding or any guests that haven't given their permission.  NTA.  Good luck", "What is she? A 7 year old in day care? She needs a warning because she stood on chair? Last I checked that\u2019s a basic no-go children learn by age 7\n\nNTA", "NTA and i do not know how you put up with someone like that, ever. i do not have it in me to tolerate that kind of drama.", "The waiter telling her to sit down was the warning. NTA", "NTA\n\nInfluencers and other perpetually online people are sick, and they suck.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to be ready to kick her out of the wedding too", "Also, if not allowing people to stand on chairs is bullying, I must tell my sister immediately! She's a kindergarten teacher, who has apparently now been bullying children for years! /s", "I think she thought she'd look \"hotter\" than the bride (whom she hated, shocker) and everyone would tell her so. To my knowledge, nobody ever even mentioned this to her, and I hope/bet it drove her batty. She has since divorced out of the family.", "It\u2019s a good use of BSB you may already have kicking around though!", "I don\u2019t even know anything about inks but I am HERE for this exchange \ud83e\udd23", "Oh my Lordy, she need some serious therapy and you might have to uninvite her from the wedding because I have a feeling she\u2019ll do the same there. How old is she? I hope not an grown adult, sounds like a 13 year old issues, let alone an adult. NTA.", "Nta. Oh but you did warn her! You told her you would not be tolerating any of her silly and over the top antics at your wedding this includes the engagement party, dressing fittings and any other small/big events that may come along with getting married. Your sister sounds like someone who has to be centre of attention all of the time and isn\u2019t happy when someone else is being doted on. My sister is like this. I was in hospital after having an emergency C-section (everything went okay thankfully) but she was sitting in my room in tears about how the nurses wouldn\u2019t let her into the NICU to see the baby because Covid restrictions were still set that only parents were allowed in. It\u2019s allllll about them all of the time", "But, you see, it's going to be *off-white*. And it will have a few flower embellishments at the hem. \n\nAnd it won't be a *ball gown*. It will be a knee length dress. \n\nCLEARLY not a wedding dress, so I don't know why you're getting so upset about it. \n\nAlso, the bride said she was wearing a veil, so it's okay for me to wear a tiara. \n\nWhy are you making this such a big deal? *STOP BULLYING ME!!!!*", "This reminds me of the story of the bride who expect her future MiL to show up in a white wedding gown so she asked all of her friends to wear their wedding gowns to her wedding and she wore something very not white.  MiL showed up as expected and threw a fit because she did not stand out at all among the sea of wedding dresses.", "Get me some too", "NTA- but be prepared for what she\u2019s gonna do it your wedding.", ">She says that I could have given her a warning instead of kicking her immediately out.\n\nSure you could. But would it have worked? You already know the answer to that.\n\nNTA. Your wedding, your rules.", "This was my thought as well, OP did give her a warning before the dinner! One warning is enough.", "In a lot of clubs they actually put a very visible sticker over the camera lens, if you use your phone and the sticker isn't there, you're kicked out immediately.", "you could always allow pagers lol. then you know only the people who REALLY need to be available would bring one.", "I don\u2019t get parents that think they can\u2019t be without a phone on them when their kids aren\u2019t with them. I think it\u2019s hella unhealthy. Signed, a parent of two almost tweens.", "ok, and I can see that being desirable in some clubs or in gyms. Not necessarily the case at a wedding, where the bride, groom and their family and friends normally would enjoy casual snapshots of people enjoying their special day.  Normally, the guest list at a wedding is all people who have a common bond & can be expected to treat other guests respectfully.  The problem here is one individual, not the existence of phones & cameras.", "Epson makes a refillable printer cartridge, the refills are basically little squirt bottles. They are available in black, cyan, yellow, and magenta and just judging by how much they stain my fingers I think you'll be good to go.", "Agreed, but since it was suggested for people to surrender their phone co.pletely (and people rightfully saying that some people do need to stay reachable) this might be an in between thing. \nYes it sucks for the sane people, but if OP does want to invite sister, but doesn't want to deal with the shenanigans, this might be an option.", "I have a teenager with amazingly good squirt gun aim. He likes weddings.", "Gave me nightmares when I had to have one for being on-call overnight.", "I agree it is an option, and a good one for some circumstances.  I don't know who you would have as the camera police at a wedding, though.  Clubs and gyms have employees to police.  Weddings generally don't. I've dealt with attention-seekers/narcissists in my past and stand by my opinion that it's not a good idea to spend tons of energy on trying to prevent their scenes & drama because it is impossible to prevent them from making a scene.  You need boundaries with people like that and the willingness to tell them to leave immediately when they cross the line."]}
