Yeah, I'm going to need more notice. And that is *always* the answer. I've got plans. Next June? Plans.", "Yep. Or if one of them is a girl, immediately parentify her. Wouldn't work if she's five, but a few years from now, I bet he would.", "PPLLLAAAAANNNNSSSSSS.", "Also, don\u2019t have 3 f\u2019ing kids if you can\u2019t take care of them yourself.", "Family isn't required to baby sit. If you want freedom to do what you want. Don't have kids, NAT", "Right... this is beyond dumb. \nOp, NTA in any way.\n\nYour brother and his wife have kids, their kids. No grown a$$ adult should need help in their own home, with their own kids for like 2-3h unless there's an emergency or someone is ill.\n\nI have 3 kiddos, and suffered massive migraines. I still manage to keep everyone safe and alive. My husband has run solo for 3 consecutive days because I'm in a migraine bout.\n\nYour brother is being willingly daft. Heck my 11y son could manage 3 kids for 2h. (And no he doesn't parent when I'm unwell, and if he babysitting he gets paid always)", "Agreed. Reasons are for reasonable people.", "Or hire a baby sitter like most people have to do who don\u2019t have family that can do it", "The brother may have three kids, but the wife clearly has four.", "What nail appointment takes HOURS?  I used to get my nails done. My gal was a pro, got me in and out under an hr (around 40 minutes). And she did full nail painting art.", "I was thinking the same thing.", "SIL Leaves to get her nails done \"HEY WAIT BRO!!! WHY YOU LEAVING TOO???\"\n\nYep. They tried to set her up to babysit all damn day. ICK.", "I agree. It was last minute, she wasn\u2019t asked to help him babysit, and he obviously was going to go out himself, so makes sense they were going out together.", "And then had the nerve to make a nail appointment, knowing he can't handle shit, and get mad that someone who has no compulsion to deal with kids chose to not help", "This is something people will do on purpose. They think if they create an \u201cemergency\u201d situation people will pity them enough to do what they want.", "Then he'd be perfect to do the job - since he's ALL ass.", "That\u2019s where the \u201csit\u201d in babysitting comes from.", "Have a second kid and a divorce :)  Mental load with 2 under 2, was less as a single parent than with a husband and the 2 under 2.  In all seriousness, good on you for recognizing the issue and making decisions based on it.", "Happy Cake Day. I've never shared this particular part of our decision to have only one child. We had thought two or three. Money was certainly a factor but on the emotional side I have my own deficits, CSA, over protective and ill mother, divorce. But as truly helpful as my husband could be with hands on parenting he is impatient and can be critical. It's a broader family thing on his side. And hearing some of the things that were said among the family and the hurt... hair-raising. And I thought I was the fucked up one. But we made mistakes and worked hard to apologize and do better than what we were shown. We're a tight little team family but we didn't want to screw up two or three kids when we weren't sure we weren't screwing up one.", "Bingo he doesn't want to.", "Did you not read correctly? Only their mom and mil takes care of their kids. Both husband and wife are useless", "I also love how in all these types of posts, the parents have to weigh in and tell (OP in this case) she is wrong. Maybe tell your son to parent his fucking kids that he chose to have.", "Yeah, it drives me crazy when people refer to watching their own child as babysitting. My husband and I each have our own kids. His daughter was a teenager when she came to live with us, but he's been in my son's life for most of it. I can't tell you how many times he let me sleep in while he took care of my son, and often times I'd wake up to an extra kid or 2 because a friend needed a babysitter. I wish I could share him with all the people who deserve a person like him.", "I still can't wrap my head around SIL cancelling her appointment and then blaming op because her husband wouldn't watch his own kids, that he chose to create.", "If Evangelicals could read, they'd be very upset.", "bUT thErE mIgHt bE A dIaPer tO cHaNgE ... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f /S", "SIL too so that she can hopefully realise her choice in life partner is... off. \n\nhow else can I say she chose a dud dad for her kids.", "This is true.\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Period.", "I don't know, I'm kind of proud of her for stating exactly what her plans are lol. If she was going to spend the day watching paint dry, I think she would have informed them of that too. She knew she wasn't going to back down. Good healthy boundaries. He can't make her do anything! \n\nNow if she's really worried about AITA because of what her Mom said, then that's another boundary she needs to work on.", "Yep, both are enabling them to be shitty parents.", "My cousin married a woman like that. They have three kids, the last two are twins, and where they live both parents work 4 days a week when the kids are small. So one day a week she would look after the three kids while he was at work. And she couldn't do it. So her mother had to drive for two hours the day before, sleep over and help with the kids the next day and then drive back two hours.\n\nEvery week!!!!! For years.\n\nHe had them on his day off and most weekends in his own. Without needing help.\n\n\nThey are divorced now.", "Why should she need to cancel them? She is one of two parents. The other parent could be parenting his kids.", "Yes. You love your kids and you take care of them without expecting anything in return otherwise why did you have them?", "Honestly... I'm collapsing under the second-hand embarrassment that OP's brother feels this comfortable so brazenly proclaiming his complete and utter failure as a responsible adult human, much less as a parent! He's even indignant at the mere suggestion that he might actually have to parent the children he fathered without supervision for AN HOUR OR TWO.\n\n\"Yes, I decided to make 3 new humans; having to ever provide any type of care for them without supervision was never something I signed up for! I'm so incompetent that I am literally unable to care for my own offspring for an hour without assistance! The audacity of people that would expect me to have the basic competence of a 14 year old babysitter is beyond the pale!\"\n\nI'm so unbelievably embarrassed for OP's brother, it makes me queasy.", "DING DING DING WINNER!!!\n\nOP you dodged an all-day (and probably evening too if they were planning a date supper) bullet.\n\nEdit: NTA 100%. They can freaking pay for a sitter.", "Totally agree.\n\nNot to mention\u2026 I have three kids myself. One, if I want my nails done? My husband *parents* and it\u2019s just NBD, just like if he wanted to go out and do whatever. Two, if I had a day ahead of me lounging at the pool alone (or with friends, whichever), HELL NO would I drop everything to babysit, especially for a non-emergency like Mom\u2019s nail appt when Dad is home!", "Or given how young they all are brother got her nocked up 3 times before she fully realized what a terrible partner he is.", "Yeah, but then took out her frustrations on OP instead of just leaving the house for her appointment. SIL is an AH too!", "I bet the father calls it \u201cno thanks\u201d", "I don't know. I'm proud of her because she should be able to sit by her pool, but . . . low drama/low conflict/low information = low problems. Now, she's got family problems. This is one of those where less would have been more.", "This right here OP.\n\nDefinitely NTA. Your brother is 40, he chose to have kids. You have chosen to remain childless. Let him figure out how to parent his own kids. Be a great aunt, help out in true emergencies only.", "I wouldn't put it past the dude, whatever he's doing is working if he's got mom and his wife on his side. As a student of toxic masculinity, I'd say she should lean into the argument he's incompetent. It's easier to prove and really targets his fragile ego.", "Right? Don't ask people to babysit last minute unless someone is dying.", "100% he should be able to watch his own kids", "Ahh so that's why it's called child rearing", "I\u2019ll admit that the hips do look like they help saddle kids with a side hold, but that is IT.", "She also doesn't have kids so her me time is useless she needs to be a good auntie \ud83d\ude43", "Happy Cake Day. I've never shared this particular part of our decision to have only one child. We had thought two or three.

Many places on the US basically just pretended there was no shut down", "Weponized incompetence. Many men are good at this when it comes to taking care of their own children", "And it would end up being at least half the day or more while SIL got her nails done, then got coffee and went grocery shopping and maybe went and got a new outfit since why not? OP was there already. What\u2019s another hour or two or three?", "Hey, those beers aren't going to drink themselves.", ">is he like, a turkey or a manatee or something?\n\nThis is going to be my new motto I think, thanks!", "Run to Mommy & tattle on little sister\u2026\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Grandmother could always step in.", "OP said he has never been alone with his kids lol, imagine being this useless and getting angry with someone else.", "Don\u2019t even tell them about commitments. No is a complete sentence.", "I have to remind myself that this sub is representative of people with conflicts, not all parents, because otherwise I would be extremely disappointed with how many parents just don't parent. At all. And foist their kids upon other people for free.", "I feel so bad for straight women.", "My SIL had to have some hospital treatments recently, and some friends of mine asked who was watching the 14 month old twins. I was all \"my brother, he took the week off work\", and some of them couldn't believe he was watching them himself. I told them it'd be pretty pathetic if he couldn't parent his own kids."]}
