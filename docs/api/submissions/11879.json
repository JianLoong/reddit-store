He's a personal trainer and met this woman at his gym, and they've been seeing one another for the past few months. When asked by myself and our sister where he sees this going, he says they're just having fun and enjoying it in the moment. Fair enough. Say no more. I know what he means by that and younger people will do these kinda things at that age.\n\nWe share a lot of common overlap in our social circles between longtime friends and family members, and initially, he was keeping his relationship life separate from his social life, but lately, he's been asking if it's alright to bring this woman (note: he never utters the word \"girlfriend\" or \"partner\" when talking about her, and only her first name) to things like concerts and birthday outings with friends.\n\nThe problem is that nobody really cares for her presence. She's very much into her physical appearance and making video and pics of gym selfies, by the pool, or travel, and sometimes including my brother in them like a prop with hashtags about their age gap. She has an established career, but she's also not been the most personable. When our parents met her, my mom being the way moms are asked if she had been married or anything previously, and she snipped back at my mom in a way that myself and my sister didn't care about. Our friends have said that it's not fun having out with our brother when she's around because she makes everything about her, she's not really into getting to know anyone, or she'll bring one of her single girlfriends uninvited, and it's just mega awkward for everyone.\n\nA good friend's birthday is coming up, and we're planning on going out the city for the night to celebrate while staying overnight. My brother wants to bring her, but my friend just wants a close crew of friends, his siblings, and anyone's significant others that he knows well. Initially, my brother was going to come by himself, but when this woman caught wind of his weekend plans, she pressed him to have her come along. I told my brother that it wouldn't be a good idea since this was our friend's milestone birthday and he just wanted a close group, but he didn't take it too well, especially after his girlfriend-not-girlfriend evidently told him he needed to make decisions for himself. She messaged my sister on Instagram asking why she wasn't invited, and she was truthful that it was just a close friends kind of deal, and then told my sister that she thinks I'm just jealous because my younger brother is dating an attractive woman while I'm still single. I messaged her myself after that, and reiterated this gathering was for close friends only, she was not invited, and that I would appreciate if she was more respectful toward myself and my family, and now my brother isn't talking to any of us.\n\nAITA for for not wanting my 24 y.o. brother's 48 y.o. girlfriend around at our social gatherings, especially after that experience?", "created_utc": 1678374709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11munxu/aita_for_not_wanting_my_24_yo_brothers_48_yo_gf/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By 48, you'd expect a person to understand how invitations work. You can \"make your own decision\" about whether or not to accept an invitation, not about whether you bring a +1 who wasn't included in the invite. Also, it sounds more like she wants your brother to make decisions her way, not on his own. He'll probably have to learn those lessons on his own the hard way when all of this continues to blow up in his face.", "NTA. Wow, she sounds very entitled. Whoever\u2019s birthday it is gets to decide who\u2019s invited to the outing. She doesn\u2019t get to invite herself to everything. She was very rude to you, and it sounds like you handled it in a very mature way. She\u2019s TA", "NTA. The one with the birthday decides on who to invite - and the age gap has nothing to do with her unlikeable personality.", "NTA\n\nShe has a very unlikeable personality. I know the age gap is weird by itself, but that's not the issue. It's her personality. \n\nIf you don't want her to be at these parties, then don't invite her. Being your brother's GF doesn't giver her an automatic invite/pass.", "Wait wait wait, she told your brother that he has to make the decision on weather or not she's invited, then goes behind his back to two of his siblings, and then when she gets shut down by both, proceeds to blame the siblings? This person is insane. NTA", "NTA.  It' your friend's birthday and it should be how and with whom he wants to celebrate.\n\nThis has nothing to do with age and everything to do with the fact that she's selfish and insecure, and using your brother as a prop to make herself feel better.  If she was 24, or 30, or whatever, doesn't sound like you'd want her around anyway.  I know I wouldn't.", "NTA\n\nLike you said, its a milestone birthday for your friend. Your friend should decide who he wants to be around. He should celebrate his birthday the way he wants with who he wants.", "NTA She old enough to know how rude it is to invite herself. She sounds like an entitled narcissist", "NTA\n\nIt just sounds like she's using your brother and is trying make it look like they're in a \"relationship\" by doing \"relationship\" things.", "NTA\n\nIf he isn\u2019t treating the relationship seriously then why should you. No reason for you all to have to build memories including her if she isn\u2019t going to actually be an important part of your life.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m inclined to try and check in with your bro. It sounds like she is becoming controlling of him and he may be out of his depth with her.\n\nEven though he is an adult she may be taking advantage of him in a way and that often leads to abuse of some kind or another.", "Age gaps CAN work and I don't think this is really a problem about the age gap. That might make the start at socialising with each other a little bumpy, find the common interests may not be as obvious, but thats it. Look at almost every hobby there is and you find someone older than yourself who enjoys it too. The real problem is that she doesn't seem to be interested in socialsing with you to begin with. \n\nThe real problem seems to be that she want's control over your brother. She want's someone younger to 1. boost her ego and 2. that does as she says. What would make the situation a little harder would be when your brother and her would make it an official relationship, it leaves a bad taste to tell a friend he can't bring his partner. But as they ain't it is fine to tell him the invitation he got is only for him and it's not to bring along a guest of himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nYour friend doesn't want her there, and that is the only person who has a vote.\n\nI'm more worried about your brother, but also fear there's not much you can do without risking her isolating him completely.\nTry to stay open towards your brother, make sure he knows he's loved and welcome. So that when the day comes he sees her for who she is, he has somewhere to go", "NTA. She needs a bit of a reality check on how socially uncomfortable it is for any 48 year old dating a 24 year old. She\u2019s getting a SLIGHT social pass only because she\u2019s a woman not a man. But it is GROSS and uncomfortable.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have messaged her tho. That\u2019s on you.", "NTA.  Sounds like they deserve each other.", "As far as your brother has told you, his relationship with this woman is fairly casual. That's OK, but there's no social obligation to invite casual dates to social events. If their relationship becomes more committed, then they reach the point where you need to invite them together to any kind of mixed social gathering. Sounds like they're not at that point.\n\nNTA", "NTA Its your friends party not your brothers so its your FRIENDS decision who goes, definitely bot your brothers and certainly not his gf/not gf/fling decision", "NTA. No need to over- analyse, she wasn't invited to a small, close friends only event. Simple as that.", "Doesn't sound like a bit of fun when he is doing exactly as he is told. She is inserting herself into all aspects of his life and its her way or no way by the sound of it. \nYour brother wanted to attend alone and she changed his mind, does she think she will get switched for a younger model perhaps?\n\nNTA", "Well now we know why she's dating a 24 year old. \n\nWhy has she met your mom? Why has she met all of you? This sounds way past sex  \"friends.\" NTA.  Her behavior is creepy. \n\n>I messaged her myself after that, and reiterated this gathering was for close friends only, she was not invited, and that I would appreciate if she was more respectful toward myself and my family,\n\nYou didn't say anything nasty or rude.", "I'm going to say NTA, however I don't think it was necessarily your place to step in. It would make more sense if the close friend had told your brother about only wanting to close friends there, but you got involved even though it really isn't up to you at all whether your brother's lady friend comes. It's up to the birthday person. The fact that the girlfriend told your brother to make decisions for himself is also weird though, like your brother can't just decide his girlfriend is allowed to come to someone else's birthday party.", "NTA bc you can invite anyone you want to any gathering that you are hosting (or in this case your friend's bday when he's explicitly said close friends only) but you speak really dismissively of her in your post, which makes you a soft YTA. Why aren't you ripping on your brother for using this hot older woman for sex and perhaps having mommy issues (see how that sucks to hear that put out there)? I think your brother is kind of gross to be with her, frankly.", "Yta\n\nNot for having an opinion, but this is your friends birthday. If they don\u2019t want other people around, they can explain that to your brother. It\u2019s not your place to decide who can and can\u2019t hang out for a celebration that isn\u2019t centered on you", "I'm going to go with ESH. You wrote a lot of judgemental stuff when the core issue is that you don't like her, which is fine. But why are YOU the one deciding the guest list for your friend? It's not really your place to want or not want someone to come. Ask your friend for the guest list and butt out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This woman is attractive, looks younger for her age, and makes her own money, but the fear is that he's just doing whatever she says, and little by little, he's losing his autonomy in it all. Being a younger guy dating and sleeping with a fit good looking older woman who is emboldening whatever the relationship is with social media posts probably feels like a flex to him since she claims she's trying to help his training career through it.", "My sister asked me to, because my sister said she didn't want to deal with it since she'd have been less careful with her words in response.", "Why does she get a pass as woman? She\u2019s almost 50. What is this group going to have in common? Im 9yrs older than the girls in my husbands friend group and I feel it a lot. The guys are all the same age. Im 3yrs older than my husband but they mostly all have gf\u2019s 5-6yrs younger than them.", "why is it gross? As long as they are adults, why do you care?", "I respectfully disagree. It's right for OP to take care of this as it's their brother. It would be the same if someone is having trouble with the spouse's family being inappropriate and the spouse needs to be the one to deal with their own family.

Currently, it seems very superficial on both ends. He's having sex with an attractive older woman he met at his gym, and she's having sex with a fit younger man who probably makes her feel good about being older and still able to attract guys half her age.
