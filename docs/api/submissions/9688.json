She also calls me a sped and other ableist words because I have hearing problems and have to sit in the front.\n\nI tell my school therapist Mrs. Ramos about Bella\u2019s bullying. Mrs. Ramos says she has sent Bella to be spoken to by the principal and other counselor, but it\u2019s not really effective. Whenever I try to tell one of the teachers, Bella\u2019s friends will back her up and call me the liar, so the teachers just tell everyone to focus and won\u2019t do anything else.\n\nI was venting about Bella to my sister Nikki. Nikki explained that she tutored Bella\u2019s brother when he was a freshman and she was a senior, and that Bella\u2019s father died when she was in 4th grade. Nikki said it wasn\u2019t an excuse for Bella\u2019s bullying, but wanted me to know that Bella\u2019s bullying is because of her own personal issues and not my fault.\n\nBella was bullying me two weeks ago during recess again. I was really pissed off, but I also felt bad for her since I now knew about her father being dead, so I told her \u201cYou know what Bella? I am very sorry about your father. I know it wasn\u2019t fair to you.\u201d The teacher came back and started class before Bella could say anything back, but I noticed her friends whispering to her during class.\n\nPeople are still spreading rumors about Bella. Things like Bella being an affair child or her father leaving because she was a bad kid. I\u2019m not sure why Bella hasn\u2019t just explained that he died. It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s embarrassing or something she needs to keep a secret.\n\nI said what I did to Bella to show her that I understand her life isn\u2019t perfect either and that she also has issues. My friends also agreed that it was more mature than insulting Bella back. Nikki just said that the school should have had Bella visit the other counselor more in the first place.\n\nMy other sister Janelle told me that the rumors aren\u2019t directly my fault. But that I did add fuel to the fire because I know middle schoolers will start rumors/drama over anything and since Bella\u2019s going to a different high school, it would have been better to just wait out the situation with her.\n\nNikki\u2019s boyfriend and his siblings came over to visit and his younger siblings both told called me a terrible person for bringing up Bella\u2019s dead father at all. Because they personally know how traumatic it is to not have a father (their father isn\u2019t dead, their parents divorced) and that Bella\u2019s father dying is probably the reason she\u2019s acting out.\n\nI understand that and feel bad for Bella. But it still isn\u2019t an excuse for her bullying. And I don\u2019t have any control over the rumors being spread about Bella.

However if your response was truly as mellow as you\u2019re describing then I think you handled the situation in a surprisingly mature way for an 8th grader. I do think you should confront Bella again, if you don\u2019t apologize for the accident of fueling rumors, she\u2019ll resent you until you graduate. It sounds like she needs a friend that isn\u2019t in this for the drama, but one that\u2019s in this to care.", "NTA yeah maybe its the reason but i wont call a bullying victim an asshole for clapping back once not even e-s-h", "Part of me thinks \"Don't dish it if you can't take it\". And her own trauma isn't an excuse no; and when I was 14 being bullied (at that point, I'd been bullied since I was 8), if I had ammo, I used it. \n\nBut - as a now 30yo, I wonder what \"reason\" she has for bullying you. You said she picks on you for your clothes/appearance, are they better than hers? Is she bullying you and saying ableist shit because she secretly has problems she doesn't want to admit to? If you're the only one she bullies, I just wonder what it is about you that makes her see you as \"her\" target. Obviously this has nothing to do with you - especially if you're just minding your own business. \n\nThere was a girl that bullied me when I was 15. I remember it starting because I spoke too loud (hearing loss) and she told me that my voice made her want to \"smash my head into the glass window until it broke\". I remember retorting that I had the right to talk and I'd do what I pleased. This didn't help matters (and it also didn't help that I was weird as fuck already -autistic, ugly, loud, speech issues, etc) and also didn't help that a \"friend\" of mine told her I had called her a slut (a common insult back then). It went on, until she got her ass handed to her by someone else. Basically, she mouthed off to the wrong person. It was everywhere, all over the school, all over the news, AND her family even went to an A Current Affair style show to \"plead their daughter's innocence\". When she came back, she started her shit again with me and I just quietly said \"I'm sorry for what happened to you\" - and she told me \"I don't give a fuck, now shut up before it's you next\". And now - all these years later, I still maintain some sort of... responsibility for being so weird and \"targetable\".\n\nI dunno, I'm torn between N T A and E S H - but I'd have to go NTA. You weren't using it as ammo, you didn't lie about the situation, you just expressed condolences. I wouldn't do it again though - but don't feel that you have to just \"shut up and take it\" until graduation. There will always be Bella's, the same way there will always be K's (my bully). The way to deal with them is to learn how to stand up for yourself, keep reporting the situation, and have someone to talk to about how it makes you feel - a friend, parent, counsellor, etc.", "NTA. Losing a father is not an excuse to bully people.", "You are growing into a compassionate adult. You aren't responsible for what immature nasty people do.

It\u2019s not your fault that Bella can\u2019t handle her emotions and is lashing out on others. That\u2019s up to her to handle her business not you\n\nNTA", "ESH This is a classic scenario. Someone talks trash and then you talk trash back and they don't like it. The only reason I say ESH is because the dead dad attack is a low blow. Still, good for you.
