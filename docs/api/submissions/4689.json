We ended up deciding to spend Christmas at our house this year since they were going away and my family were more then happy to come and spend it with us at our house for lunch. We still invited his family incase they changed their mind and wanted to spend Christmas with their grandkids, even triple checking that they were still going away and weren\u2019t coming so we could organise how much food to get for the Christmas lunch. A few days ago my partner had come to talk to me explaining that his parents want to spend Christmas with us now (which is very last minute) and they want to come to our house for breakfast but doesn\u2019t know why they don\u2019t just come for lunch and will ask if they can just postpone their trip a few hours and do lunch. I never heard anything about it after that so I asked him today if his parents were coming to lunch? He told me no they are coming for breakfast. \n\nIt is always this way with them though, everything always has to be convenient for them and suit them and an inconvenience for us even though they have no kids to cart around or any heavy responsibilities. It is just so inconvenient for us to do both a lunch and breakfast. Between waking up with a newborn and young child on Christmas morning opening presents, cleaning the house, setting up outside, prepping and cooking food for lunch and taking care of the kids, there is no time for a Christmas breakfast. Not only is there no time but I\u2019m not going to have any room in the kitchen to cook or clean the dishes for breakfast because of all the dishes and food that will be cooking for lunch. I explained this to my partner but it just turned into an argument and he told me I can be the one to tell them they can\u2019t come then (even though I was never asked and it was never confirmed with me) and that I don\u2019t get to make all the rules (even though I will be the one up late wrapping presents, feeding our baby, cooking, cleaning and taking care of the kids aswell). I\u2019m putting my foot down because I\u2019m not going out of my way, having a rushed day and extra stress put on me because it is convenient for them when they can either choose to not come at all or delay their trip a few hours.

It is a big deal to cook and host a family Christmas lunch (and have Christmas morning with your kids). It\u2019s just crazy that his parents think they can not come to lunch and expect to come to breakfast instead. Not possible. And your husband should be the one telling them, not you. Tell your husband you absolutely cannot cook breakfast or clean after it, you and kitchen will be fully occupied making Christmas lunch. Ask him to repeat the invitation to his parents for Christmas lunch (even that is an AH move by them not to tell you in advance so you can buy and prepare food for the right number of guests).

You triple checked with his family to make sure they didn't want to do something with you guys on Christmas since they were going away, and now, almost exactly 10 days before Christmas, they're saying they want to come? 10 days is really not a huge amount of time when it comes to planning, and it sounds like you're going to have a lot on your plate during the holiday.\n\nIdk why they can't just join you for lunch, but maybe their times to leave are inflexible. If that is the case, they really don't need to spend Christmas with you this year. They made the choice to leave and they have to face those consequences. Or, they could at least not expect you to provide a breakfast they asked for. I feel like common courtesy would be to show up with a fully prepped breakfast for all to enjoy, rather than expecting you to acommodate them.\n\nShow your husband this, honestly. He needs to know that what you do as a mother and wife is incredibly hard and time consuming, that you literally physically cannot make a breakfast as well as the already planned lunch.
