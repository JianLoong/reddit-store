I have two cameras, a Polaroid and a more expensive Cannon. I got these cameras as Christmas gifts (on different years) from my boyfriend. So they mean a lot to me. \n\nThe Polaroid was kind of a white elephant since it\u2019s $16 minimum for 8 shots, and there\u2019s no guarantee the photo will turn out right. So it turned into an expensive hobby real quick. So the next year my bf bought me my more expensive Cannon camera, to compensate. Pictures went from $2 a shot to $.12 at Walmart. The cannon is also sturdier, by comparison so in theory I could let my cousin take photos with it. \n\n\nThe thing is that my cousin (10m) is an absolute nightmare and if he wasn\u2019t family I would never go near him. He breaks EVERYTHING he has absolutely no concept of the word \u201cno\u201d. Or he does and he just ignores it. His parents in their defense have tried hitting, times out, media black outs, and he\u2019s in behavior therapy for an hour every other day. He\u2019s smashed things in my mom\u2019s house and my uncle would pay for it to be replaced, but when my cousin smashed my cat\u2019s cat tree he told me he\u2019d order it for me on Amazon. Then never did even when I asked about it. Whenever my cousin would smash something of mom\u2019s it\u2019d get replaced no matter the cost, if it was mine it never would. So why would I trust their volatile child with anything I own? So I don\u2019t. \n\nMy cousin keeps asking to take photos with my cameras and I tell him no. I tell him to ask his parents to buy him a camera for Christmas then he can take all the photos he wants. I keep telling him to ask his parents to buy him one and to not bother me about mine. \n\nMy aunt doesn\u2019t like this, she doesn\u2019t see why I don\u2019t just hand him my camera. I\u2019ve even offered to sell them my Polaroid for like $20 cause I never use it anymore. They said no, why don\u2019t I just let him take photos with it instead, so I said sure just buy the film. They said no. \ud83d\ude43\n\nThese people aren\u2019t broke, they have their own (successful) business and can replace flat screen tvs at moments notice. They bought him an ATV last Christmas??? But my family doesn\u2019t get why I don\u2019t let him photos. I\u2019m the meanie who\u2019s selfish with her stuff.

It might even get him to stop pressing you to share with him. \n\nBesides, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a DSLR since you mentioned an expensive Canon. If you want your 10 year  using a DSLR you need to buy him, his own. That\u2019s not a \u201ctoy\u201d and in general you shouldn\u2019t be allowing your kid to play with other peoples expensive items.
