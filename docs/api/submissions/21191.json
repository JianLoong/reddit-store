That\u2019s just ridiculous. Like telling a Spanish speaking person not to say Dios Mio or something.", "NTA. You were not speaking to her. You were speaking to yourself. Welcome to multi-culture workplace", "NTA, but just for fun, ask her if it would\u2019ve felt more comfortable if you shouted \u201cOh shit!\u201d.", "NTA it's so weird she would say something  about it and they fact that their response was for you to \"not speak in  your language\" which is fucked up to me, that is definitely discriminatory imo.", "NTA at all. She's a massive xenophobe and sounds totally incompetent. It's unfortunate but bosses do have to entertain these things sometimes to cover their backs but your boss should have addressed with her why it was so uncomfortable. It's an exclamation for God's sake, not a conversation in Mandarin. I'm also sure being multilingual makes you a great candidate for a customer facing job so they have no right to ostracise you for this. I hope she gets fired during the review so you can live and work in peace.", "This is not only b.s. on the part of both your co-worker and your boss, it\u2019s probably illegal. What state are you in? Federally, the circumstances under which a business can enforce English-only rules are very narrow. A sudden exclamation of surprise would very likely not qualify. Depending on your state, the prohibitions on requiring English-only in the workplace may be even stricter. On a federal level, your boss is flirting with a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and may be in indisputable violation of state law.", "NTA.\n\nIf you were going to insult her, you have plenty of perfectly fluent english language to use.

Sorry OP.", "NTA. Ai Yah is not something I'm familiar with beyond TV, but it sounds like a generic exclamation of surprise that happens across various languages in various ways such as \"ahh! Good grief! OMG! Oy vey! Ay Dios mio! etc.\" Your colleague being upset about you speaking your language in an exclamation like that is ridiculous. I would understand if you an a different colleague were whispering behind her back while making sidelong glances and giggling, but forbidding someone to speak their language is lowkey racist and not okay.", "NTA. There is no reason for anyone to have a problem with you having an exclamation in your own language. I can only see two reasons why Elisa would go to your boss and complain about this: she is either xenophobic/racist, or she is trying to distract your boss form her own incompetence.", "NTA. lots of people who havent learned a second language dont know how hard it is to break habits like this. Like Ive been learning mandarin for a long time yet still always say umm instead of \u90a3\u4e2a\u3002", "NTA.  She IS being discriminatory.   To be honest, I probably would have thought you were (justifiably) saying something mean about me, too, but I would then have gotten over myself when you told me what you had actually said.   It's her not taking that second step that has created the situation here, not your exclamation.", "NTA. So Elisa almost burns you with her incompetence, and she thinks it's fair to blame you for involuntarily saying an expression of surprise in response?", "Lol what, this is such a NTA situation. You insulted her in your language? And then taught her what the expression means? Congratulations now she\u2019s learned a bit of another language. I\u2019d be thanking you for the education.

Much like you don't need to understand Yiddish to get that oy vey is a similar expression of exasperation, or uff da in Norwegian, or an English speaker saying ugh or oof. \n\nAnd even without that being the case, she asked you what it meant and you told her, and at that point she has no reason to think you were insulting her in a language she doesn't understand. She can even go google it and find out it just means exactly what you said. At this point she's being xenophobic AND basically accusing you of lying. You've already addressed her concern and told her what it meant, and it's ridiculous to say you can't ever say a word in another language on the job, especially in a situation like that. Would they be acting like this if you were French and said \"sacre bleu\" and she took offense? Unfortunately, I doubt it.", "NTA.  But if you don't think she's going to make it, you need to state that in the \"meeting\". (And why, and what she'd need to do to help her get better.  \n\nBack to the topic, everyone has different expressions, slang, and interpretations.  And her using your expression to distract from her potentially dangerous actions shouldn't go unchallenged.  She could've harmed herself or someone else.\n\nAnd your response was during a workday, facing something very far from ordinary (in the moment).  You explained it to her, and she chose to deflect when talking to the manager.  \n\nJust my opinion, of course, but I wouldn't second guess myself.  And I would learn a small bit from this, and continue doing what I'm doing.", "NTA. You can speak however you like, and it's pretty normal for people to utter expressions in another language.", "NTA.  I am not even going to address Elisa.  Your boss was shockingly out of line with the comment that you refrain from speaking in your language.  He/she is in need of retraining.", "Not know that.    She must have lived in a basement", "YTA. I was leaning towards ESH until the part you said you thought it was obvious she knew to turn the wand off. Safety is number 1 in any job setting. Not to mention, if it's someone's first day on the job, accommodations should be made so that they feel welcomed.
