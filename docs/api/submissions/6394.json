This kind of behaviour is on the owner, not the dog. I know that my dog doesn\u2019t like to be touch while in his bed so I am clear to anyone that he should not be touched in those instances. She should have warned you but she may not have thought about it quickly enough- I know I have missed the signed that someone was going to pet my dog and had him snap out at them and that\u2019s on me- not him.

If they're decent people eventually they'll get over it, you just have to develop the habit muscle of saying hi when you come over.

I think the problem is they don't see it this way and they view it as disrespectful not to talk to them, I would apologise and make an effort to say hello more in the future. \n\nTo me it sounds more like a communication issue rather than you being an asshole, it would have helped if they had actually told you the problem rather than just giving dirty looks and ignoring you though.", "Esh I've had family stay with me. Their guest don't have to seek me out to greet me, neither do my husband's. I'll be honest I'm not interested in awkward small talk either. If we run into each other obviously we say hello but if their path doesnt bring them by where I'm at it is no big deal. It's polite for the boyfriend to let his parents know you are coming over but that's where it ends for me tbh. It is also super weird that she snubbed you over not saying hello. If she has an issue she should say so. I don't understand this teenage response from her. I'm saying esh because you seem to think it is reasonable that they be all upset and so do most of the comments so maybe it's a culture thing I don't understand. \n\nI'm also confused by the dog bite thing? Does the dog have a history of biting or is it just territorial over the bed? Either way I think that's probably on the mother. If your dog is aggressive it is on you to make sure it doesn't bite.

Or could the fear and awkwardness be from your own home life? If that's the case and your bf parents have been nothing but nice to you, then maybe it's time for you, your bf, and his parents to sit down and have a chat.

Tell them that you respect them, and appreciate their generosity in letting you stay there as often as you do. Say it's for that reason you didn't always immediately come say hi. A very important part to remember for your apology, is to tell them you were taught it was respectful to *NOT* intrude.

Whenever her boyfriend came by, I'd give them space. I felt she was kind enough to house me, the least I could do was make sure I didn't intrude on her time with him. Guess what? They thought it meant I didn't like him being around. He was starting to feel unwelcome. \n\nMy actions were viewed as the complete opposite of my intentions. I felt horrible, and embarrassed.
