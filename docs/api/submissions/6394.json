This kind of behaviour is on the owner, not the dog. I know that my dog doesn\u2019t like to be touch while in his bed so I am clear to anyone that he should not be touched in those instances. She should have warned you but she may not have thought about it quickly enough- I know I have missed the signed that someone was going to pet my dog and had him snap out at them and that\u2019s on me- not him.

When I lived with a roommate her boyfriend went out of his way to be polite and include me in conversations and things, and in return I totally adored him and didn't have any complaints when he and his dogs practically lived with us.", "Agree with so much of this, my only caveat would be it doesn't need to be extra cooking and cleaning.  What can be perfectly fine when visiting can be a real imposition when it becomes \"a lot more.\"  \n\nThe line where it crosses into being there too much will be different for everyone.  OP - did your bf check in with them that the frequency of your visits are okay with them?  \n\nI have young adult kids and like their partners very much, but I wouldn't want them practically living in our home.  \n\nAlso OP - idk what you mean that they should have told him off but that's not how dogs work.  When you first started going over there your bf should have explained how to (and not to) approach the dog.", "You should always punish a dog for biting. OP didn't know she shouldn't approach the dog while it was in their bed and as she approached, someone could have said to leave the dog alone, it doesn't like to be approached while in bed. But a dog biting should never, ever be ignored.", "My mother has made comments before about how she didn\u2019t like it when my ex popped his head round to say hello as she was relaxing and felt it was intrusive", "I mean OPs post history is a hot mess too. There\u2019s a lot of issues going on it seems like", "Then what did the mother do? Did she say anything when she saw op approaching her dog? Did she try to stop her? Or did she let her go up to the dog and try to pet it without warning her? I think it\u2019s the later.\n\nDogs have been put down for doing just this before. If op was truly an awful person, she could get the dog out down at worst or on a list/registry at best. \n\nThe only ignorance I see is coming from you.", "OP would not be TA if she had to search for them to say hello. She got invited by someone who lives there she doesn\u2019t need to play a game of hide and go seek as soon as she gets in the house. I do think op is TA tho bc it seems like the parents are just in the living room and she just walks past and avoids that area so she doesn\u2019t have to interact with them.", "I would do as you were thinking, bringing some sort of peace offering, and basically explain what you said to us.  If they're decent people eventually they'll get over it, you just have to develop the habit muscle of saying hi when you come over.   Battling awkwardness and nerves is always hard, but if you're in their home it's truly the least you can do.    \n\nBut I think you got this.", "I understand where you're coming from. I get these irrational bouts of self consciousness too sometimes where I overthink just about everything. I'd apologise to the mum, just explain how when you were growing up, it used to irritate your mum when your friends would bother her and you worried it would be the same with her. And from now on, always pop your head in and say hi.", "Damn, I hate when people do this to me. My family's friends would always come in to say Hi every time they were round, wanted me to explain when I was doing on the computer, have quick chat, all things I dread. I would love if they just came in and ignored me lol, this is my alone space.", "Agree that a houseguest can be draining even if they are being helpful and not doing anything wrong.  (Completely off-topic, my MIL just left after a 5-week visit).\n\nAlso agree it was up to BF to properly introduce OP to the dog and explain their habits.  Personally I would never try to pet a sleeping dog, and I generally want to see their tail wagging before I touch them.", "OP is 24 and should have learned by now to \"let sleeping dogs lie.\" Literally.  And it matters whether it was a warning nip or a serious bite.  I have no doubt if there was a need for first aid OP would have added that to her list of grievances.\n\nRegardless, it is not OP's place to decide how someone else's dog should be disciplined in their own home.", "She\u2019s 24 not 5 people shouldn\u2019t have to watch her around the dog it\u2019s basic knowledge not to approach a dog you don\u2019t know well in their bed aka their safe space \n\nIf she\u2019s been there so often why doesn\u2019t the dog like her? Dogs don\u2019t bite for no reason. Mostly if dogs want to be pet they\u2019ll come up to you", "OP go and speak to his mother and tell him this. Say you're really sorry but you get anxious and were taught this by your mother about your friends (don't mention an ex just in case that inflames them for whatever reason, while it shouldnt).  \n\n\nLay it on a bit about how much you like his family etc and would have never done it if you weren't trying to be considerate but you can now see how it came off rude instead.  \n\n\nSometimes communicating and admiting your wrong is all it takes. if they are stubborn after that then it's a them problem.", "Well, now you know it's not what others would consider polite. You can do better now that you know how rude they (and others) consider it. It might feel awkward first since you are trying to create a new model of behavior, but you can do it with some effort.", "So your mother speaks for everyone? Just because your mother had a dumb view doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to follow it.", "If you really dont know, your mom is the odd one out in terms of manners here. \n\nYou don't need to have full blown conversations with people relaxing, but greeting them when they are letting you stay over is common courtesy. In not doing this, you've made yourself appear rude and probably a bit entitled to be there when you're just a guest. \n\nYou can rectify your behavior, maybe even explain and apolgize that your mom is odd and you grew up with different expectations. At least it gives an explanation for your rudeness.", "I would feel the same way as your mother, and I know the last thing my mom would have wanted when I had people over was them popping her head in. Some people are just more private and if that's what you and your family are like it totally makes sense that you would assume other people feel the same. Now that you know how they feel you should really say hi, but I'm not judging you for that not coming naturally to you.", "Have to disagree with you. Allowing your dog to bite a guest whether provoked accidentally or not, to me in unacceptable and signs of an irresponsible owner.", "No one\u2019s mother speaks for everyone, but you do tend to learn behaviour from your parents. Chill", "This comment was way more rude than it needed to be. OP has been raised with one set of expectations, so naturally those are the ones she operates by until she gets information that counters it. We all have the load of learned habits and behaviors our parents have taught us (and some will be abhorrent to at least part of the population). It's on OP to change her behavior now that she knows that what she was taught at home is not how majority of people would expect her to behave,  but the way you put it? Not very constructive.", "Then OP and boyfriend can move out and go elsewhere. Bfs parents are letting her use their house and she can\u2019t bother to just say hi? It\u2019s not hard.", "OP is an adult and has had no issue engaging before. She\u2019s way past the point of needing to be taught basic manners especially when someone else is allowing her to crash at their home."]}
