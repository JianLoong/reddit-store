Especially since she lives so far away.  \n\nI'm thinking she's hoping you fall in love with your nephew and want to have a relationship with him so that will help you facilitate a reconciliation with your brother, but that's speculation on my part.\n\nYour mom sounds obnoxious tbh.  Why is she insisting on 1. You buying your nephew, who you've never met, a present, and 2. Why is she trying to force you to reconcile with your brother, but not trying to communicate to him that he is not equally at fault for the rift for his absolute GARBAGE treatment of those around him?\n\nI smell golden child treatment, and it reeks like a dirty diaper (and not your nephews).", "Youre not the asshole for cutting someone out of your life that treats you like shit.

This is a baby, and one you\u2019ve never met, not like it\u2019s crying itself to sleep because it\u2019s aunt won\u2019t visit.

It may be time to go LC or NC with your parents since they don't seem willing to respect your boundaries. Based on the way you described your brother I can't help but wonder if they want you to make up for anything that will be lacking in your brother's parenting ability.  However that is not your responsibility nor are you required to have a relationship with your brother's child.  Your  brother is the one who procreated not you. Genetics doesn't mean you are required to have a relationship with your brother's kid. It doesn't make you a bad person either.  It doesn't mean you have anything against the baby.  You just don't want to develop a relationship and that is your right.  For all you know you would be a terrible aunt so people acting as if you are somehow punishing the baby by not having a relationship with him are just spectaculating. No kid needs people in their lives that don't want to be there because that is how they end up with issues as adults.", "If your brother is the problem, and you're able to see the baby and the mother without him what's the problem?  \n\n\nShe and that child did nothing to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What has the baby done to you? Just because it's your brother's baby doesn't mean you have to treat that baby as if it was your brother. They're two different individuals. You're allowed not to have contact with his family whatsoever, at least keep it low and typical. \nYTA for feeling resentment towards a literal baby who did nothing to you. But you're not the a-hole for feeling resentment towards your brother. \nAsk yourself, what WOULD HAPPEN if that child grew up and wanted to get to know you and develop a family relationship with you?

The baby will grow up wondering why the aunt doesn\u2019t care for them. You are taking it out on the child. Your problems are his doings. I think the mama just wants to assure her child has a loving family for her child. You don\u2019t owe your brother a thing. It\u2019s not going behind his back because you won\u2019t be hiding it. You just won\u2019t be telling him. You don\u2019t need his permission. If he is so awful to the mama then that is more reason to support her. You aren\u2019t owed to be asked if okay for the mama to ask to see you. I feel sure she wants things to be okay between you and her and the baby.

His relationship with them is fantastic, they worship the ground he walks on, though they did have a big fight during the pregnancy after he split up with the mother because my mom reached out to her to maintain friendly ties and he wasn't happy with that. My relationship with my family is up and down, with more downs than ups lately since I won't brush the argument under the rug until I get an apology and see a change in how he treats me and others.", "I hadn't thought about this. maybe? I know my mom bought most of the clothes and baby equipment rather than my brother, because he's on the younger lside (the mom of the baby is 32 but doesn't work). the last time I spoke to my brother he was very much in the \"drinking, fucking and fighting\" stage of life and while it's possible he's grown up in the last six months, I can't be certain. \n\nI'm good with toddlers and older children, but babies freak me out lol.", "Do you have kids?\n\nhow would you feel if a family member you don't get along with, who you don't speak to, was seeing them behind your back?\n\nI don't know if my brother is aware of this arrangement - I asked my mom and she didn't confirm or deny. \n\nas much as we are no friend to one another, I was upset when I found out he'd seen my dog without my permission. I don't want another fight on my hands down the line when he finds out.", "I don't resent the baby. I don't wish the baby any ill. I don't feel anything for the baby. It feels like a literal stranger's baby. I met his mother maybe 4 times before he was born. I don't know how my brother feels about me being in the baby's life, because my mom went straight to the baby's mother rather than through him, and I am not comfortable having a relationship with the baby if he isn't aware of that, either. \n\nthe baby is very unlikely to want a relationship with me as an adult. it's growing up a six hour drive away from where I live and Reddit is my only social media, so he would have no way of contacting me anyway.

I don\u2019t talk to one of my family members but I worry about their offspring. That, because of their parent they will be left behind education wise and possibly quality of life/standard of living. So I stay in touch with the partner in case the offspring need anything we can facilitate. \n\nYou are definitely NTA. It\u2019s not your duty or your role. \n\nHowever, with an already absent dad the child will need all the help he can get to grow up into a decent member of society.", "That's speculation.

Do whatever you have to to take care of yourself. Maybe the little one will find its way into your life one day when you figure things out. Which you will!!!", "NTA.

Not to say I haven't done my fair share of free babysitting, I'm an eldest daughter with a 7 year and 12 year age gap with my younger siblings and I have a special needs cousin in his teens I help out with when my aunt needs me to, but I don't think it's a factor here. I do wonder if it's a present thing since my mom was shocked I didn't get the baby one when he was born and has asked me what I got him for Christmas, but again, I can't be sure. when I asked why she cared, she just said \"because it's your nephew!!\" Over and over and asked why I was punishing a baby over an argument he wasn't even alive during.", "they've been enabling him since he was a toddler and still get confused when I point out the differences in how they were raised and how they raised me and my sister. if they don't get it now they never will.", "this means a lot - I've been doubting my choices a lot with the holidays coming up knowing that waiting for an apology means making alternate Christmas plans, and is upsetting the family, but I've given in too many times hoping things would improve and they never have. I'm not doing it this time.", "My brother works, just doesn't make a ton. he's in the army on a junior soldier wage. Baby Mama is on disability but I am not sure how long this will last as it is due to a cancer she went into remission for prior to her pregnancy. \n\nI know my mom and the maternal grandmother of the baby had an argument as the maternal grandmother asked my mom to pay for some of her house refurb as the baby was going to live there and my mom declined but agreed to help with furniture for the nursery, so who knows. She's in for a rude awakening if she is, my own home is only half finished as it is.", "This is a good idea! I likely won't have to see them until January now as I'm spending the holidays with a friend, so I'm going to use that time to create a bit of space anyways.", "Okay, it didn't really matter to my judgement but it would change how I wrote my response.  Thank you", "making alternative plans is a lot easier than being around people who, when it comes down to it, don\u2019t respect you enough to work on themselves and create an environment where you never doubt you are loved. your happiness matters way more than theirs and this internet stranger hopes you have the best holiday ever :)", "Good for you! Coming from another dysfunctional family situation, I have empathy. It\u2019s so hard when guilt feelings are involved and invoked, but stand your ground, take your space needed, and take care of yourself first. I am working on doing the same since my family certainly won\u2019t do it for me or help in any way. Good luck to you, and sending good vibes and wishes of happiness your way!"]}
