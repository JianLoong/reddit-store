Thank you", "making alternative plans is a lot easier than being around people who, when it comes down to it, don\u2019t respect you enough to work on themselves and create an environment where you never doubt you are loved. your happiness matters way more than theirs and this internet stranger hopes you have the best holiday ever :)", "Good for you!
