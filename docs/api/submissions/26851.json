We were supposed to go out to an extravagant birthday dinner since he had spent a lot of money on my birthday earlier in the year. He earns a lot more than I do, so I could only do so much, but still. We have been together 2 years  \n\n\nWell on the day preceding when we were supposed to go out, I noticed my cat had what appeared to be a cyst in her eye. It had appeared overnight and looked very painful and bad. I drove her 2 hours to an emergency vet open one Sunday instead and got some eye drops but there's a really big risk she may lose the eye. She hasn't been eating because of the pain and I was really worried so I cancelled dinner and decided to stay home with the cat, telling my partner we can reschedule it for another night and that he's welcome to come over and look after her with me. \n\nWell, he got really upset and said he had taken the next day as a vacation day already (he was planning on getting drunk) and that the waiting list for that particular restaurant was 3 months and they won't have his favourite seasonal special on then so I was being incredibly selfish and a mega asshole. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Broke up with boyfriend. This post made me realise I care about my cat more and would cancel plans like these 100x over if the same situation came up again, no regrets. She still isn't eating and is very weak, I am going back to the vets today because despite not eating she has developed diarrhoea.", "created_utc": 1694693809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16igvjz/aita_for_prioritising_my_cat_over_taking_my/", "score": 3438, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love my cat a lot and believe if my SO was in this position I\u2019d be okay with rescheduling my birthday dinner (as disappointing as it could be) \n\nBut at the same time I can acknowledge that someone may not have that sense of empathy towards pets. You also didn\u2019t mention if you even tried to make alternate arrangements", "From what you've written it sounds like you sprung this on your partner at the last minute.  \n\nIs this the case?\n\nSomething like this is common courtesy to let your partner know as soon as there is the potential for something like this to get in the way.  Based on how you described it you had over 24 hours knowledge that this could potentially be a problem.  I'd wager a lot of your bf's annoyance isn't due to your cat but from feeling like an afterthought.\n\nA better way of handling things would have been the following:\n\n1. Message bf when on your way to/at the vets.\n2. Let him know what is happening and that there is a potential your cat may need supervision.\n3. Actually speak with him about your pet and:\na. Your hopes that your cat will be completely fine.\nb. That it might not be right to leave your cat\nc. That you'd feel awful about missing his birthday.\n4. Make the above a conversation where he'd feel included.\n5. Keep him updated.\n6. Plan an alternative evening around yours for that evening but with whatever small touches that you can manage.", "Bring on the downvotes, but YTA. I highly doubt you\u2019re staying up 24 hours a day keeping constant watch over your cat. You surely could have stepped out for a few hours to fulfill the commitment you made to your boyfriend. \n\nAlso, if you were truly worried about your cat scratching his or her eye, you had plenty of time between the vet visit and the birthday dinner to purchase a cone. If that still wasn\u2019t enough to give you peace of mind, you could have hired a friend to sit with the cat for a few hours.", "This is an unfortunate situation. Emergency situations arise now and then and the best plans go down the drain. If you felt at that time your cat needed your presence so be it. I am with you. Dinners can be rescheduled. Of course he is going to be pissed. Try and make it up somehow.", "Am I the only one that thinks NAH?\n\nSure, the cat would've been fine at home for a few hours, but '**there's a really big risk she may lose the eye**'. Our dog had to have her eye removed last year due to glaucoma and it was horrible emotionally - regardless of whether she was comfortable and had pain meds, neither of us wanted to leave her unattended for a while, even after the diagnosis and before she had surgery. Every pet owner is different and handles things differently. The cat may have been fine but OP might not have been had she been away. All sorts come into play such as your pet, travelling to the vet, money, dealing with insurance etc.\n\nAnd yes, OP's partner has every right to be upset that his dinner was cancelled. It sucks, especially when he booked vacation days, and he has the right to feel the way he does. It's just something unfortunate that happened and is nobodies fault.", "This comment section is really surprising to me.\n\nI think a lot of people on here have been quick to reduce your cat's condition and your worries to an overreaction. For me, the biggest overreaction is that of your boyfriend, who seems to think his desire for a particular meal on a particular day is a priority over your unwell pet.\n\nYou couldn't have won here, in his eyes. If you'd gone for dinner and been worried or preoccupied he'd likely have felt that you ruined his night. If you'd gone home and felt that your cat's condition had worsened you'd have resented your boyfriend for pressuring you to go for dinner.\n\nYou are not an AH at all. You made the right decision as a responsible pet carer. I hope your cat recovers smoothly.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and fuck this comment section. You can't explain things to a cat. Yes you would need to watch the cat in this situation and moreover, having you there means the cat is less stressed. Cats have feelings and while some of them hide when ill, just as many cling and want to be with their person when unwell. Cats are full emotional beings who need support. It's just a birthday dinner and seasons happen every year. If the cat rips his eye out then OP will have bigger issues. Also, you can't leave your cat home alone in a cone either. It's not safe. So either way OP needs to be monitoring the situation.", "Who wants to bet the real answer is she didn't have enough for the dinner after paying the vet bill?", "Did the vet say the cat needed constant monitoring? It seems like a 2-3 hour outing to dinner wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. YTA", "YTA. How will you supervise the cat when you're asleep? With that being said I'm sure you could have taken some time out to go to dinner, have a friend come over and watch, or get a cone, or you could have invited him over and you two have dinner at home.", "YTA. I love my dogs too, but for the kind of ailment the cat has right now and is under treatment for, spending x hours to treat your BF to a birthday dinner on his birthdate was not impossible. More so if this restaurant really is in such high demand.\n\nI\u2019d feel differently if the cat had only a week or two to live \u2014 that\u2019s different in severity. If I was really that concerned \u2014 I\u2019d have had someone watch the cat for the few hours I\u2019d be gone. It\u2019s one thing to cut the night shorter than he would have liked, and another entirely to just cancel his birthday plans altogether. The next day, week or month is not his birthday.", "Sorry, but yta.  My dogs are my priority, but you had the vet visit and drops already.  If it was that serious, the emergency vet would have held your cat.  And you could have gotten the cat a cone or padded collar to prevent scratching.  You could have at least made dinner happen and had him back to your place for drinks as a compromise.  Not ideal, but you gave zero flexibility, shit you could have told him to take a friend and still covered it so he doesn't have a wasted bday, reservation, and vacation day.  I get where your heart was at, but this was an over the top response to the situation, especially considering you've been dating 2 years.", "I need more info. Did you take the week off from work? Cysts don't heal overnight. Was the vet alarmed? It sounded routine. If the vet told you to stay and monitor, you are NTA. If not, then you are overreacting, which is understandable, but YTA.", "I'm going to be blunt, but I think OP spent the birthday dinner money on her cat and doesn't want to admit that's why she had to totally cancel the dinner plans. She's hoping to get enough solid justifications here to avoid having to tell The Whole Truth. \n\nIt's okay if you had to spend the birthday dinner money on your sick kitty, I would've done the same. It's not okay to try to hide the real reason you had to cancel dinner and try to play on sympathy and emotions. \n\nGentle YTA, but only because you're not being fully honest about why you cancelled dinner.", "NTA\n\nI'm not leaving my animal alone in pain either, especially so much pain they're not even eating. I can't imagine how scary that would be for them to be in so much pain and then their person just leaving them alone. It's one thing if you have to work or something but just to go out for dinner.... I wouldn't do it either and I guess if that makes me an asshole so be it.", "NTA- how could you go out and enjoy yourself knowing that your cat was in pain and alone?. Your partner should\u2019ve been more understanding towards you and the cat you can celebrate another time. \n\nI hope your cat gets well soon", "I think soft YTA you didn't have to cancel the reservation, let your BF bring a friend instead while you stay home with the cat. There's no reason your BF couldn't have gone, and the offer for him to come over and help with the cat instead doesn't sound like a fun compromise for his Bday.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA Did the vet say the cat needed 2; hour monitoring and just sent it home? Surely you could have made dinner work", "I'm going to have to go with YTA      \n\nMaybe not the most major asshole, because plans can be made again, but still asshole because there doesn't seem to have been any real benefit to the cat to your staying home.\n\nYou don't say that the vet said the cat requires constant supervision. \n\nYou were sent home with eye drops. Presumably you give them every X hours. If the cat was in so much pain, you should also have requested pain meds. (Our cat received them for painful UTIs at times). But there's nothing being there could have accomplished once you gave the drops *until* the time for the next dose came up. It's just one of those emergency situations where all you can do is medicate, wait, and hope.\n\nElsewhere in the comments you say the cat was scratching at its eye and didn't have a cone, but I don't think that makes sense. First, you didn't bother to try getting a cone. Second, are we supposed to believe that because you stayed home, you were able to catch your cat's presumably lightning/cat-quick paw every time it went to scratch, thus preventing this scratching? If not, then how is scratching a reason to stay home with the cat?\n\nListen, I've always had cats. I absolutely adore them. If there would be a meaningful benefit to one of our cats to stay home, I'm sure we'd both cancel plans. But here, there was no actual need to cancel.", "I'd have done exactly the same as OP and i'd have kept the cat, got rid of boyfriend.  OP gave very valid reasons for not wanting to leave the cat, I wouldn't leave mine if it were wearing a cone and I have taken a week off work to care for mine after an op. Mine wore a cone, still managed to pick out the stitches which meant a rush to the emergency vet as he was bleeding out. So no, cone or not, I'm not leaving. You have a pet, you look after it properly, especially when there's an issue.  A meal can be done another day.", "I empathize with your cat being sick but YTA. If the cat needed 24/7 care it would have been hospitalized.", "YTA - I can\u2019t really comment on the cat situation since I\u2019m not there. YTA for cancelling the reservation without talking to your partner\u2026 whose celebration this was supposed to be for. You are also pretty blind to think that someone would want to spend their birthday *looking after your cat.* Are you kidding me?", "You're not an A for wanting to be near your sick pet, but you are absolutely TA for not bothering to do anything else. You didn't offer to cook, get take out, set up a movie, anything like that. You just short notice cancelled on your partners birthday with a blas\u00e9 attitude about it. YTA", "NTA. \n\nSome years ago, I had planned a moderately expensive weekend away with my then long distance boyfriend. We were going to meet up in another city.\n\nMy cat fell ill & we didn't know what the problem was. I told him I wasn't coming. That I was taking my cat to the hospital instead, and he cancelled our reservations, including paying all of the cancellation fees,and took the train to my city, instead.\n\nI was really glad to have his support because my cat didn't make it. \n\nThat bf? We'll soon celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary.", "YTA- you didn\u2019t need to stay home you wanted to. Of course your boyfriend is upset, he went all out for your birthday and you couldn\u2019t even bother to call him and see if you could work something out. I grew up on a farm and yes there are times animals need to be monitored but this absolutely doesn\u2019t seem like one. I get it, people love their animals because they think they \u201clove\u201d them unconditionally, but really they love you because you feed them and house them and are reliant on you. I\u2019ve found that people who are super obsessed with their pets to the degree that they are a huge priority over any human relationship have sone serious emotional issues that I have zero interest in dealing with. I LOVE animals ( to the degree where I don\u2019t think owning them is super ethical) and I believe that we have an obligation to treat our pets in a kinds and caring way, but your cat is not going to be permanently harmed by being left alone when not feeling well. I mean are you going to take days off of work to stay with the cat until it is better? Probably not because cat would be fine. Boyfriend is not going to be fine if you keep letting him know he is not a priority in your life.", "YTA, and not because of your cat. I understand being upset about your cat, and if you thought you had to stay with them, then that's a judgement call that none of us can really make over the internet. You are there and know your car's condition better than we could. \n\nBUT, you use a lot of language with negative connotations when it comes to your bf. \"Extravagant\" birthday dinner and he earns a lot more than you? And? What's that got to do with anything? \"He was planning on getting drunk.\" Really? Is that what he was planning, or was he planning on staying out late and having a good time. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you like or respect your bf at all. Just stay home with your cat if that's the case. Stop letting people you don't even care about interfere.", "NTA and depending on your pet insurance situation really, really NTA. \n\nMy dog lost an eye. Treatment for serious eye infections is vital and difficult. You\u2019re trying to save her eye. We failed. (Partly because he has the strongest and most exorcist revolving neck I\u2019ve ever encountered and razors in his mouth but I digress) eye removal is very expensive. If it\u2019s not all covered that could impact your ability to pay for this meal. \n\nOverall this could be a compatibility issue. What matters is what you see as natural and reasonable (as do I) he finds unreasonable. You need to be at least on a closer page re priorities. He feels you don\u2019t care about his birthday, you probably feel that he doesn\u2019t care even about your feelings for your cat. I\u2019m with you but in terms of compatibility that\u2019s irrelevant. You\u2019re different in this way.", "YTA. Do you work? Do you sleep? You would spend more time away from your cat doing those things than you would for a dinner.\n\nIf you two were going away for a weekend, then it's understandable to want to change your plans but not for a dinner that would take only 2-3 hours.", " NTA \nI once canceled my own birthday because of my cat\u2019s health emergency.", "NAH.\n\nIt's understandable that your partner was looking forward to his birthday dinner but I totally understand you, I would never leave a sick pet alone, even for a short amount of time. Also, a living being is far more important to me than a birthday dinner.", "NTA. My BF sent me this post and he agreed with me when I said I would do the same for my cat (especially if she woke up with an eye growth!). I would also expect the same reaction if something like this happened to his dog. We both agree that pets are not objects and should be treated as living things deserving of empathy.\n\nThe real question is is this the guy you want to be with? Judging by your comments he sounds like a real brat.\n\nHope kitty is okay \u2665\ufe0f", "YTA for your treatment of your boyfriend. You completely disregarded his feelings. You canceled the reservation before talking to him. You could have said you'd be terrible company and suggest he keep the reservation and take a friend. You didn't try to see if you could get the food to go. You didn't offer dinner at home or any alternative plan. You didn't seem to really apologize. You just expected empathy without offering any.", "I\u2019m gonna get downvoted but NTA. Is your boyfriend an animal/pet person? Tbh I think dating someone with different views on pets will usually lead to conflicts like this. I know he was disappointed and that sucks but life happens (and this is coming from someone who LOVES their birthday).", "NTA. No one would be giving you shit if this was a sick child; people might not be able to relate to \"my pets are kids/family\", but that doesn't change the fact that to some owners, animals ARE family. You did nothing wrong; you can't change that your pet is sick. You can absolutely make up plans with your partner. \n\nIf my partner called me and said their pet was sick, I'd offer to come stay with them, too. Everyone saying OP should've left the cat.. okay, and why couldn't her partner come to her house if he was so hellbent on keeping some semblance of their plans?? \n\nIf my pet was sick I doubt I'd be able to focus on going out. There is zero reason her partner couldn't have offered to come to her place; the onus for that is on him just as much as her.", "Info: You say that the cat is in pain - did the emergency vet give you pain meds?  Or are you just assuming the pain level bc kitty isn't eating right now?  What were their recommendations? Did you tell them you had plans, and if so, did they tell you to stay home and monitor the cat? Did they mention hospitalization? Any mention from the vet about a cone?\n\nIn my 20+ years working in veterinary medicine, these are questions/comments that would be standard. And if you didn't ask specific questions, did you call the ER and ask if they thought you should stay home?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause if none of that happened, YTA.", "YTA. Not for wanting to stay with the cat, but for how you communicated it.\n\nDid you discuss it with the vet (you know about the dinner, so it would have been a normal question). Did you tell your boyfriend beforehand or did you just confront him. What effort did you put into making the night special for him and still be able to monitor the cat? A lot of possiblities there. But looking at your original post, you just canceled and told him he was welcome to come over. That's very low effort.", "YTA- but not for staying home with your cat, who is suffering. YTA for not first discussing canceling the plans with your bf. You could have easily called him, explained the situation and then if he still wanted to go to this restaurant he apparently is excited to eat at, take a friend or family member in your stead since you needed to be elsewhere. You could have even given him a card and some money towards his meal you weren\u2019t able to share. You have been together for two years, communicating things like this is important.", "Unless you're a feline eye doctor, what exactly were you going to do for that cat that night? You got her the medicine and you kept an eye on her and she's unhappy but stable. But fine. You don't want to go out anymore. But you then canceled the dinner entirely and asked him to spend his birthday looking at your cat with you? You didn't even give him the option of still going out to eat on his own or with a friend. \n\nYTA. It's great that you love your cat. And I understand that you may not be able to concentrate on anything else until she is better. All that is fine. Your partner may not want to be in a relationship where his milestones aren't important, and watching a cat sleep is more important than keeping special plans for a few hours. There were absolutely compromises available to you, but you didn't consider any of them. \n\nHope kitty is feeling better.", "Absolutely NTA and I can\u2019t believe how many people are saying the opposite. If you\u2019ve been together for two years, by now, he should already know about the importance of your cat. I understand his disappointment, but being angry at you doesn\u2019t make sense. If I was you, I would be planning an alternative celebration for him and letting him know. However, if he chooses to leave you over this, at least you know you made the right choice anyway because you\u2019ll still have your cat.", "YTA, but I'm glad for your bf that he gets to see where your priorities are: pets>people", "NTA - eyes are way more important than a birthday.", "NTA, your pet had a medical emergency.

When he was being a terror, he lives up to his name, he watched Jazz queuing me. After about a year Loki started queuing me, sometimes when Jazz was sleeping. Loki seems more sensitive than Jazz, but at this point Jazzy is a senior and his senses are dulling some...  I had 2 procedures to give me a medical induced remission.  Sadly 1.5 yrs later my left side fails, but came back slow.  I didn't know what was going on until Loki rushed up to me and sat staring at me with that look.  I didn't take my meds bc I thought it was my TMJ.  After a few min Loki gets right in my face and won't stop. Min later I'm in so much pain and scrambling for my gabapentin.  He's continued doing this since the end of July. He rarely leaves my side and while he was never a big cuddler he now lets me fall asleep with my arm around him.  During bad flares he makes sure to be by my head vs sleeping at my feet. He just purrs constantly and watches me. He won't leave until it passes.   Jazz, he's has done his que a few times since, usually the most severe ones IF he's awake. He is 14 now and is health isn't too great so I'm shocked he still does his magic.\n\n\nNow Jazz was from the neighboring farm, less than a mile from house to house if you walked through the pastures.

Without knowing more about the balance of her relationship it's hard to know if this was fair or not. If OP takes more than she gives I can see why he was upset. If she gives more than he does then he could have sucked it up. We only get a small window and these incidents don't exist in a bubble.\n\nI don't think OP is an asshole for being too anxious to go anywhere because they're worried about their pet. I think they might be an asshole for unilaterally cancelling an important night without attempts to compromise. Make a nice dinner at home. Get take out. Get drunk at OP's house. Ask him what he'd like to do instead that doesn't involve leaving. Confide their fears. But don't just say \"oh we aren't doing anything now because my feelings about my animal takes precedence over you feeling valued.\" She could have seen about getting a pet sitter or maybe even leaving the cat at another vet for observation if the risk was so high. There's lots of things that could have been done. She could have even discussed it first instead of dropping it on him.\n\nBased on the unspoken, read between the line bits, it seems like nice nights out might actually be a rare occurrence for them. Someone who takes a vacation day to cut loose the night before seems more in line with the actions of someone who doesn't do that often. He would have also had to have done it some time in advance.

One time, I refused to leave our hotel room without the cat when one of the rooms caught fire and we had to evacuate. I stayed to get him even after he attacked me. The other was when the cat fought like mad to get out of my arms as I was trying to get him to our safe room when there was a tornado on the ground in my town like two miles away. Both time he clawed and bit me to the point I had to seek emergency treatment afterwards. The cat does NOT like to be saved, apparently.  \n\n\nI gave up my every penny of my savings doing literally everything I could to save a previous cat. It cost 7k+. When he was dying a few years later, my husband and I agreed we'd would drain our then savings of upwards of 25k to save him. We could not save him, but the effort cost about 9k  \n\n\nI'm the type of person who would apparently risk their life for and spend whatever it takes to save their pet. I absolutely believe without question they are more than \"just\" pets.  \n\n\nI wanted you to know that before we get to this next part. When the previous cat was a kitten, he somehow scratched his eye and eyelid. Like a little flap of skin was hanging down from the underneath and he had scratched his cornea. We had made plans and paid for a day trip into NYC well before this happened. He needed drops a few times a day. We didn't cancel. We put him in the car and drove into NYC and paid to park in a centrally located lot. We walked back to check to on him a few times and give him his drops. (It was fall, so it wasn't hot in the car. We cracked the windows for him to get fresh air. We let the attendants know he was in there.) He was in a tiny cone.  \n\n\nHe was fine. The lot attendants said he clowned around a bit for them and then slept most of the time. It wasn't a matter of life or death. He wasn't SICK. He had an injury that the only way to treat it was to give him his drops and try to keep him from rubbing his eye.  \n\n\nThe OP says in the comments that the vet didn't express concern over the cat losing its eye. That's the OP making that up in their own head. The OP could have, and SHOULD have, gone to buy a cone (pet stores sell them, you don't need it from the vet) if her cat was fussing at its eye. There is literally nothing else to be done about that type of injury. Drops/ointment and cone or special collar. That's it.  \n\n\nOh, did I mention I worked at a vet's for a few years? No, well I did. Let me repeat it again: There is nothing else you do other than administer the medication, keep the animal from rubbing their eye, and be alert for signs of infection and contact your vet if you believe you see them.  \n\n\nYTA, OP. The situation with your cat was nothing even close to approaching dire. Its eye was injured, and there was nothing you could do other than put drops in and get a cone/collar for it. There are situations when one should cancel or adjust plans, but that was not one of them. There are times another person should be understanding and accept the disappointment was for a good reason. This was not one of them. There are times it's valid to put an animal before a human. This was not one of them... if you gave an actual shit about your boyfriend, but clearly you do not.  \n\n\nYou don't because you cancelled plans without even discussing it with him. You did not suggest any alternatives. I'm a pretty big foodie, and I look forward to my birthday. I totally get when there is a seasonal dish at a certain restaurant that you think about and look forward to all year. There is totally nothing wrong with that. You took his chance away because by the time he could get reservations again, that would be off the menu. YTA for not telling him to take a friend and enjoy the night. Or, you could have suggested you order from that restaurant and he stop by to pick it up and bring it over to your house. You did nothing to try to make him not feel like shit and to negate his disappointment, which he has every right to feel.  \n\n\nYour cat was not in a situation to warrant what you did to your BF. You just showed him that you're a bad gf. You are unwilling or unable to realistically judge a situation and make reasonable choices accordingly. You made a big decision about him unilaterally. You gave no space for discussion or alternatives. You did not consider or respect his feelings. You chose not only to cancel for yourself, but you cancelled the whole damn thing without even having a conversation with him about it. He might have been able to still go with a friend. You ARE selfish.  \n\n\nYou CHOSE to treat him poorly and you don't feel bad about it. I would leave you.  \n\n\nBtw, if you don't work from home, do you plan on not going into work every day until the cyst is resolved? Highly doubt it, but if you did, that again shows you aren't able to realistically judge a situation and make reasonable choices.  \n\n\nFor the people who are saying, but the cat has feelings...  \nSure, I believe they do. But so does her human being boyfriend who she KNOWLINGLY CHOSE to hurt and disappoint in a situation that did not warrant it. Her cat wasn't sick. It wasn't dying. It wasn't recouping from a serious surgery. It had an eye injury (that the OP exaggerated the severity of which in her mind) that nothing else could be done for. Sure, she might have been bad company, but she didn't even give him the chance to invite someone else in her place if she insisted on staying home.  \n\n\nAll your little stories about your sick, dying, or seriously injured animals do NOT apply to this situation. She doesn't have that kind of justification here.", "I\u2019m going with a light YTA, but not for staying home with your pet. Your pet was injured and you had good reason to stay back with them. You\u2019re not an asshole for choosing to stay back with them, you\u2019re an asshole for what you did after.\n\n> I was really worried so I cancelled dinner and decided to stay home with the cat, telling my partner we can reschedule it for another night and that he\u2019s welcome to come over and look after her with me.\n\nYou mentioned that your boyfriend took off of work for the day and this restaurant had a wait list of multiple months. It\u2019s okay that you couldn\u2019t make the dinner, but you didn\u2019t have to cancel the reservation for your boyfriend. He could have went alone or with a friend, and if you kept the reservation he could have made the choice of what to do with that reservation. You took away his autonomy in regards to the reservation. You probably couldn\u2019t have enjoyed the date anyway with thoughts of your cat in the back of your mind, but it\u2019s selfish to assume your boyfriend won\u2019t want to enjoy his birthday because of your cat\u2019s health issues.\n\nI want to end on some alternative things you could\u2019ve said and done that would\u2019ve made you not an asshole while still being able to stay home with your cat:\n\n* Phrase the cancelled reservation as you being unable to make it, and don\u2019t cancel the reservation. This gives your boyfriend the choice of cancelling it himself, or going without you. Even if he chooses to cancel, he\u2019ll likely be much happier about the situation than when you made that decision for him.\n\n* Give an alternative. You mentioned rescheduling to him, but didn\u2019t firm anything up. By setting a date or making a new reservation it shows that you were thinking of him and taking the situation seriously.\n\n* Expand on your offer to come over. You offered for your boyfriend to come over and watch your sick cat. That offer does not sound appealing and I doubt that\u2019s how he envisioned spending his birthday. You could\u2019ve sweetened the deal and offered to cook dinner. You didn\u2019t really expect him to come over did you?", "YTA.\n\nSimply for not communicating with your boyfriend about plans you two made together and you knew were important to him.

I understand you love your pet and that your pet is not comfortable right now so I can fully see why you want to stay with them.\n\n But at the same time you plan to go for a nice birthday meal and you would only have been gone for a couple of hours.\n\n Also because your partner and went of his way to book a day off and you guys booked a restaurant that is not easy to book at.

Listen, I have had more than 30 cats and 15 dogs over the course of my life. I've been rescuing, fostering and adopting since I was 12 years old. I'm 30 now.

Maybe you didn't mean that, but that's what you said. Instead, everything is made about your situation. You have to validate people's feelings and take accountability when you disappoint them, even if circumstances might be out of your control.\n\nHe at no point tried to communicate that he feeling a lot of frustration and anger, and needed time to process it; he just name-called you.

I say that as  someone who would kill for their pet.\n\nI get your concerns and your worries, but the vet ultimately decided she didn't need to stay overnight, she didn't need immediate medical attention, so there was no reason to cancel the dinner.

Sorry not sorry", "Agreed 100%, and anyone who wants me to go out and celebrate them while my cat is home sick can fuck off.", "This doesn't make her an AH though. My take on it is that her bf is accustomed to more expensive things since he makes more than her so he wanted this spendy restaurant. OP probably had to budget for it and now that money had to be used for the vet. Emergency vets are not cheap and now she may need to pay for surgery. But apparently OP is an AH for not being rich.", "I would be the same, sooo many are lacking basic empathy for an animal in pain saying the vet didn\u2019t say monitoring is required card. Also people are assuming the restaurant will allow others to come instead of the person who booked it, for all we know they take reservations with a credit card since it is in high demand & charge the card accordingly. I wouldn\u2019t be letting his friends do that with my card if that was the case. It\u2019s not always black & white why she didn\u2019t suggest why someone could take her place.

Pets who are deemed able to be sent home are done so with care instructions and with the knowledge and expectations that no owner is going to stare at the animal 24/7. \n\nSince the Veterinarian discharged the cat to go home, what the OP did is extreme. She could have asked someone to check on the cat if she was having a difficult time herself (however the cat would probably sleep the entire time if no one was bothering it since the cat is trying to heal and needs a lot of rest for that). \n\nIt sounds to me like there are other issues here with the OP besides the cat.

My cat is super clingy to me. If she was sick it absolutely would comfort her to have me home. Animals do actually have feelings you know.", "This is a great point lol. There's no way it would've actually been a 2 hour dinner. She'd get shit no matter what. At least this way she's taking good care of her pet.", "I\u2019ll never understand people that throw a fit if their birthday isn\u2019t celebrated right then or exactly how they want it. Every single year I compromise on my wishes for my family\u2019s schedules, dietary needs, age needs etc. my pets are my children and I will take a bullet for them. If one of them has an emergent health problem I\u2019m not going to leave them alone. If I did get forced to go to a dinner I certainly wouldn\u2019t be mentally present and would be counting minutes until I could go home.", "It's not about supervising. It's sleeping by their side, making sure they feel loved and cared for. 24/7.", "The thing  about being in a committed relationship, is you actually need to communicate with your partner. YTA", "It's not just paranoia though, it is righteous paranoia, which is the best kind.  Then you can wield your feelings like a moral weapon.", "So expensive. Just paid 950.00 on my dog only to be told he basically has acid reflux and needs probiotics lol.", "When my cat had a corneal ulcer (result of an infected cut she hid for God knows how long) she wasn't held overnight. That didn't stop her from needing eye drops every two hours, including overnight. Care can be deathly serious without mandating  vet stay.", "Something similar happened to me. My senior dog needed oral surgery to get rid of an infected tooth, it just so happened to fall on my birthday, so I spent it at the vet\u2019s clinic and at home taking care of my dog. Surgery goes well, but 2 days later he\u2019s breathing funny so I take him to the vet, they tell me he has fluids in his lungs and needs to be hospitalized. 3 days later his kidneys are failing, he needs a ventilator to breathe and doesn\u2019t get up anymore when we go visit him. We had to put him down because we didn\u2019t want to make him suffer anymore. \n\nYou think you still have so much time left, and then it\u2019s suddenly over. I don\u2019t blame OP for wanting to stay home with her cat.", "I\u2019d argue that you probably should when the stakes are potentially losing an eye", "It was not her money so ofc she would have no problems cancelling the reservation lol. I agree with the others, it's ok to cancel, but she showed no backup plans to compensate the boyfriend and that hurted him.", "And this was a pet at risk of losing an eye. OP was understandably more worried about her cat whose life would be severely impacted if it had to get surgery and adjust to losing a body part it needed. The dinner can wait but a pet's health definitely can't.", "It's called love. \u2764\ufe0f", "I id exactly dad when my dog god real sick... she couldnt walk without falling and she kept panicking unless me or my partner held her (she is a big dog ;)). So, me, my partner and the dog slept on one big chair together. It was very uncomforable but the only way she slept. \nOfcourse you do that. My pets are my family members and I am responisble for their health.", "Love the username! \u2764\ufe0f", "I get that vibe too - that OP may be lacking in treatment of bf. And I agree that just cancelling with the restaurant without discussing with the boyfriend would be an asshole move. Communication should come first.", "I worked from home for two weeks after my cat had surgery to keep an eye on him. It was a major surgery and complications would likely have meant euthanasia. \n\nAs a pet owner I completely empathize with OP. Eyes are always an emergency and if it were to rupture or otherwise worsen, immediate vet care is necessary.", "The answer to your question is YES. You do take vacation. My dog had a serious health condition we monitored for several weeks and ultimately took him to another state for surgery. I slept with him on the kitchen floor and barely left the house for weeks. Recovery was touch and go and my husband and I switched off shifts. We weren\u2019t going out to dinner. We were ordering in. If we left the house, it was for the vet. Some things are just serious.\n\nEdit NTA", "Lots of us can work from home without needing to give a reason to our supervisors, and even then I\u2019d chance it and say most would be understanding.", "It is possible but it's exhausting and uncomfortable, some people don't care how much they have to sit through uncomfortable situations in order to help.\nI watched my dog 24/7 when he was out of hospital, I had to hand feed him, make sure he was drinking, taking him outside to the toilet and giving him his pills.\nI didn't go to my bedroom for a week, I had him set up on his bed on the couch in my loungeroom.\nWhen I had to sleep he was either in my arms or my head was in his bed so I'd awake to anything. \nI took time off work, even other members of my family took time off of work to lend a hand or let me work for a day so that his still had 24/7 monitoring.", "I spent 24/7 with my dog for 4 days when she was recovering from surgery. She was very sick and ended up passing away from a rare complication but I was with her all day every day until that happened. I even slept in the living room next to her because she didn't have the energy to make it to bed.", "My pup is a rescue and she has a hard time with changes to routine. When she\u2019s sick, it does help her to have her routine very predictable and part of that is having one or both of her moms working from home. When she\u2019s not feeling well we stay close to home.", "You\u2019re exaggerating. Your cat was dying, hers had a cyst that was being treated.", ">Keeps you on your toes!\n\nMy cats are 14 now, so they never really jump on anything high anymore unless invited or it's somewhere they know they're allowed, like my desk. One of them will randomly, every few months, decide to get on something he normally doesn't and sit there at eye level until you walk by and he can yowl in your face. He's basically fucking invisible sitting super still in a place he's not expected, until he yells, so it scares the shit out of me every freaking time. Definitely keeps me on my toes lol", "My cat makes a certain meow before he pukes. It\u2019s not every time but whenever I hear that meow I jump up and run to him!", "Bad enough for a TWO HOUR TRIP to the emergency vet. If I knew that I would have to make that drive if my cat started getting worse, I don\u2019t think I would ever feel comfortable being away from him for a significant amount of time.", "Because a sick cat wants a stranger in the house to scare them and stress them out worse.", "What part of emergency vet bill and medication sounds like OP can still treat her boyfriend to an extravagant dinner with copious amounts of alcohol. Last time I had to do something similar nearly $150 flew out of my account. Guess how much a night out with a big tab costs. Be reasonable. Not everyone has $1000 in their disposable income budget at all times.", "No. If OP's partner cares so much about a specific seasonal dish, they could have gone to the restaurant with a friend instead because it's clearly about the food then and not who they're there with.", "If my cat is sick im staying with it no question and no apology. \n\nIm not asking a friend to watch it and im not going to a birthday dinner. \n\nOnly shitty thing is they cancelled the restaurant without asking if bf wanted to go with someone else. \n\nStill, im going NTA.", "Lots of cats are not good with other people and would just put *more* stress on the cat than leaving it alone.", "You have stayed with the pet 24/7 but that doesn't mean you have had your eyes on them 24/7 to make sure they don't scratch or hurt themselves. I care about my pets and love them but let's be realistic, life doesn't stop because a pet needs a cone. She could've asked someone to watch the cat for a few hours.", "My dog\u2019s last animal hospital bill was $400. That night on the town would have to wait because I\u2019d be treating my man to some home-cooked pasta  that\u2019s been sitting in my pantry since lockdown.", "This! \ud83d\ude02 true tho (dying inside)", "There is no way I could even *have* fun if one of my cats were sick.  I turn into a nauseous, anxious, freaked-out mess, and eating a nice dinner and being good company would be the *last* thing I was capable of.  But then I've lost two in the last year, rather suddenly.  Both times I brought a cat in because I thought maybe they'd lost a little weight they were dead in two weeks (one kidney disease, the other cancer)."]}
