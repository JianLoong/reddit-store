We were supposed to go out to an extravagant birthday dinner since he had spent a lot of money on my birthday earlier in the year. He earns a lot more than I do, so I could only do so much, but still. We have been together 2 years  \n\n\nWell on the day preceding when we were supposed to go out, I noticed my cat had what appeared to be a cyst in her eye. It had appeared overnight and looked very painful and bad. I drove her 2 hours to an emergency vet open one Sunday instead and got some eye drops but there's a really big risk she may lose the eye. She hasn't been eating because of the pain and I was really worried so I cancelled dinner and decided to stay home with the cat, telling my partner we can reschedule it for another night and that he's welcome to come over and look after her with me. \n\nWell, he got really upset and said he had taken the next day as a vacation day already (he was planning on getting drunk) and that the waiting list for that particular restaurant was 3 months and they won't have his favourite seasonal special on then so I was being incredibly selfish and a mega asshole. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694693809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16igvjz/aita_for_prioritising_my_cat_over_taking_my/", "score": 1034, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love my cat a lot and believe if my SO was in this position I\u2019d be okay with rescheduling my birthday dinner (as disappointing as it could be) \n\nBut at the same time I can acknowledge that someone may not have that sense of empathy towards pets. You also didn\u2019t mention if you even tried to make alternate arrangements", "From what you've written it sounds like you sprung this on your partner at the last minute.  \n\nIs this the case?\n\nSomething like this is common courtesy to let your partner know as soon as there is the potential for something like this to get in the way.  Based on how you described it you had over 24 hours knowledge that this could potentially be a problem.  I'd wager a lot of your bf's annoyance isn't due to your cat but from feeling like an afterthought.\n\nA better way of handling things would have been the following:\n\n1. Message bf when on your way to/at the vets.\n2. Let him know what is happening and that there is a potential your cat may need supervision.\n3. Actually speak with him about your pet and:\na. Your hopes that your cat will be completely fine.\nb. That it might not be right to leave your cat\nc. That you'd feel awful about missing his birthday.\n4. Make the above a conversation where he'd feel included.\n5. Keep him updated.\n6. Plan an alternative evening around yours for that evening but with whatever small touches that you can manage.", "Bring on the downvotes, but YTA. I highly doubt you\u2019re staying up 24 hours a day keeping constant watch over your cat. You surely could have stepped out for a few hours to fulfill the commitment you made to your boyfriend. \n\nAlso, if you were truly worried about your cat scratching his or her eye, you had plenty of time between the vet visit and the birthday dinner to purchase a cone. If that still wasn\u2019t enough to give you peace of mind, you could have hired a friend to sit with the cat for a few hours.", "This is an unfortunate situation. Emergency situations arise now and then and the best plans go down the drain. If you felt at that time your cat needed your presence so be it. I am with you. Dinners can be rescheduled. Of course he is going to be pissed. Try and make it up somehow.", "Am I the only one that thinks NAH?\n\nSure, the cat would've been fine at home for a few hours, but '**there's a really big risk she may lose the eye**'. Our dog had to have her eye removed last year due to glaucoma and it was horrible emotionally - regardless of whether she was comfortable and had pain meds, neither of us wanted to leave her unattended for a while, even after the diagnosis and before she had surgery. Every pet owner is different and handles things differently. The cat may have been fine but OP might not have been had she been away. All sorts come into play such as your pet, travelling to the vet, money, dealing with insurance etc.\n\nAnd yes, OP's partner has every right to be upset that his dinner was cancelled. It sucks, especially when he booked vacation days, and he has the right to feel the way he does. It's just something unfortunate that happened and is nobodies fault.", "This comment section is really surprising to me.\n\nI think a lot of people on here have been quick to reduce your cat's condition and your worries to an overreaction. For me, the biggest overreaction is that of your boyfriend, who seems to think his desire for a particular meal on a particular day is a priority over your unwell pet.\n\nYou couldn't have won here, in his eyes. If you'd gone for dinner and been worried or preoccupied he'd likely have felt that you ruined his night. If you'd gone home and felt that your cat's condition had worsened you'd have resented your boyfriend for pressuring you to go for dinner.\n\nYou are not an AH at all. You made the right decision as a responsible pet carer. I hope your cat recovers smoothly.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and fuck this comment section. You can't explain things to a cat. Yes you would need to watch the cat in this situation and moreover, having you there means the cat is less stressed. Cats have feelings and while some of them hide when ill, just as many cling and want to be with their person when unwell. Cats are full emotional beings who need support. It's just a birthday dinner and seasons happen every year. If the cat rips his eye out then OP will have bigger issues. Also, you can't leave your cat home alone in a cone either. It's not safe. So either way OP needs to be monitoring the situation.", "Who wants to bet the real answer is she didn't have enough for the dinner after paying the vet bill?", "Did the vet say the cat needed constant monitoring? It seems like a 2-3 hour outing to dinner wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. YTA", "YTA. How will you supervise the cat when you're asleep? With that being said I'm sure you could have taken some time out to go to dinner, have a friend come over and watch, or get a cone, or you could have invited him over and you two have dinner at home.", "YTA. I love my dogs too, but for the kind of ailment the cat has right now and is under treatment for, spending x hours to treat your BF to a birthday dinner on his birthdate was not impossible. More so if this restaurant really is in such high demand.\n\nI\u2019d feel differently if the cat had only a week or two to live \u2014 that\u2019s different in severity. If I was really that concerned \u2014 I\u2019d have had someone watch the cat for the few hours I\u2019d be gone. It\u2019s one thing to cut the night shorter than he would have liked, and another entirely to just cancel his birthday plans altogether. The next day, week or month is not his birthday.", "Sorry, but yta.  My dogs are my priority, but you had the vet visit and drops already.  If it was that serious, the emergency vet would have held your cat.  And you could have gotten the cat a cone or padded collar to prevent scratching.  You could have at least made dinner happen and had him back to your place for drinks as a compromise.  Not ideal, but you gave zero flexibility, shit you could have told him to take a friend and still covered it so he doesn't have a wasted bday, reservation, and vacation day.  I get where your heart was at, but this was an over the top response to the situation, especially considering you've been dating 2 years.", "I need more info. Did you take the week off from work? Cysts don't heal overnight. Was the vet alarmed? It sounded routine. If the vet told you to stay and monitor, you are NTA. If not, then you are overreacting, which is understandable, but YTA.", "I'm going to be blunt, but I think OP spent the birthday dinner money on her cat and doesn't want to admit that's why she had to totally cancel the dinner plans. She's hoping to get enough solid justifications here to avoid having to tell The Whole Truth. \n\nIt's okay if you had to spend the birthday dinner money on your sick kitty, I would've done the same. It's not okay to try to hide the real reason you had to cancel dinner and try to play on sympathy and emotions. \n\nGentle YTA, but only because you're not being fully honest about why you cancelled dinner.", "NTA\n\nI'm not leaving my animal alone in pain either, especially so much pain they're not even eating. I can't imagine how scary that would be for them to be in so much pain and then their person just leaving them alone. It's one thing if you have to work or something but just to go out for dinner.... I wouldn't do it either and I guess if that makes me an asshole so be it.", "NTA- how could you go out and enjoy yourself knowing that your cat was in pain and alone?. Your partner should\u2019ve been more understanding towards you and the cat you can celebrate another time. \n\nI hope your cat gets well soon", "I think soft YTA you didn't have to cancel the reservation, let your BF bring a friend instead while you stay home with the cat. There's no reason your BF couldn't have gone, and the offer for him to come over and help with the cat instead doesn't sound like a fun compromise for his Bday.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA Did the vet say the cat needed 2; hour monitoring and just sent it home? Surely you could have made dinner work", "I'm going to have to go with YTA      \n\nMaybe not the most major asshole, because plans can be made again, but still asshole because there doesn't seem to have been any real benefit to the cat to your staying home.\n\nYou don't say that the vet said the cat requires constant supervision. \n\nYou were sent home with eye drops. Presumably you give them every X hours. If the cat was in so much pain, you should also have requested pain meds. (Our cat received them for painful UTIs at times). But there's nothing being there could have accomplished once you gave the drops *until* the time for the next dose came up. It's just one of those emergency situations where all you can do is medicate, wait, and hope.\n\nElsewhere in the comments you say the cat was scratching at its eye and didn't have a cone, but I don't think that makes sense. First, you didn't bother to try getting a cone. Second, are we supposed to believe that because you stayed home, you were able to catch your cat's presumably lightning/cat-quick paw every time it went to scratch, thus preventing this scratching? If not, then how is scratching a reason to stay home with the cat?\n\nListen, I've always had cats. I absolutely adore them. If there would be a meaningful benefit to one of our cats to stay home, I'm sure we'd both cancel plans. But here, there was no actual need to cancel.", "I'd have done exactly the same as OP and i'd have kept the cat, got rid of boyfriend.  OP gave very valid reasons for not wanting to leave the cat, I wouldn't leave mine if it were wearing a cone and I have taken a week off work to care for mine after an op. Mine wore a cone, still managed to pick out the stitches which meant a rush to the emergency vet as he was bleeding out. So no, cone or not, I'm not leaving. You have a pet, you look after it properly, especially when there's an issue.  A meal can be done another day.", "I empathize with your cat being sick but YTA. If the cat needed 24/7 care it would have been hospitalized.", "YTA - I can\u2019t really comment on the cat situation since I\u2019m not there. YTA for cancelling the reservation without talking to your partner\u2026 whose celebration this was supposed to be for. You are also pretty blind to think that someone would want to spend their birthday *looking after your cat.* Are you kidding me?", "You're not an A for wanting to be near your sick pet, but you are absolutely TA for not bothering to do anything else. You didn't offer to cook, get take out, set up a movie, anything like that. You just short notice cancelled on your partners birthday with a blas\u00e9 attitude about it. YTA", "NTA. \n\nSome years ago, I had planned a moderately expensive weekend away with my then long distance boyfriend. We were going to meet up in another city.\n\nMy cat fell ill & we didn't know what the problem was. I told him I wasn't coming. That I was taking my cat to the hospital instead, and he cancelled our reservations, including paying all of the cancellation fees,and took the train to my city, instead.\n\nI was really glad to have his support because my cat didn't make it. \n\nThat bf? We'll soon celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary.", "YTA- you didn\u2019t need to stay home you wanted to. Of course your boyfriend is upset, he went all out for your birthday and you couldn\u2019t even bother to call him and see if you could work something out. I grew up on a farm and yes there are times animals need to be monitored but this absolutely doesn\u2019t seem like one. I get it, people love their animals because they think they \u201clove\u201d them unconditionally, but really they love you because you feed them and house them and are reliant on you. I\u2019ve found that people who are super obsessed with their pets to the degree that they are a huge priority over any human relationship have sone serious emotional issues that I have zero interest in dealing with. I LOVE animals ( to the degree where I don\u2019t think owning them is super ethical) and I believe that we have an obligation to treat our pets in a kinds and caring way, but your cat is not going to be permanently harmed by being left alone when not feeling well. I mean are you going to take days off of work to stay with the cat until it is better? Probably not because cat would be fine. Boyfriend is not going to be fine if you keep letting him know he is not a priority in your life.", "YTA, and not because of your cat. I understand being upset about your cat, and if you thought you had to stay with them, then that's a judgement call that none of us can really make over the internet. You are there and know your car's condition better than we could. \n\nBUT, you use a lot of language with negative connotations when it comes to your bf. \"Extravagant\" birthday dinner and he earns a lot more than you? And? What's that got to do with anything? \"He was planning on getting drunk.\" Really? Is that what he was planning, or was he planning on staying out late and having a good time. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you like or respect your bf at all. Just stay home with your cat if that's the case. Stop letting people you don't even care about interfere.", "NTA and depending on your pet insurance situation really, really NTA. \n\nMy dog lost an eye. Treatment for serious eye infections is vital and difficult. You\u2019re trying to save her eye. We failed. (Partly because he has the strongest and most exorcist revolving neck I\u2019ve ever encountered and razors in his mouth but I digress) eye removal is very expensive. If it\u2019s not all covered that could impact your ability to pay for this meal. \n\nOverall this could be a compatibility issue. What matters is what you see as natural and reasonable (as do I) he finds unreasonable. You need to be at least on a closer page re priorities. He feels you don\u2019t care about his birthday, you probably feel that he doesn\u2019t care even about your feelings for your cat. I\u2019m with you but in terms of compatibility that\u2019s irrelevant. You\u2019re different in this way.", "YTA. Do you work? Do you sleep? You would spend more time away from your cat doing those things than you would for a dinner.\n\nIf you two were going away for a weekend, then it's understandable to want to change your plans but not for a dinner that would take only 2-3 hours.", " NTA \nI once canceled my own birthday because of my cat\u2019s health emergency.", "NAH.\n\nIt's understandable that your partner was looking forward to his birthday dinner but I totally understand you, I would never leave a sick pet alone, even for a short amount of time. Also, a living being is far more important to me than a birthday dinner.", "NTA. My BF sent me this post and he agreed with me when I said I would do the same for my cat (especially if she woke up with an eye growth!). I would also expect the same reaction if something like this happened to his dog. We both agree that pets are not objects and should be treated as living things deserving of empathy.\n\nThe real question is is this the guy you want to be with? Judging by your comments he sounds like a real brat.\n\nHope kitty is okay \u2665\ufe0f", "YTA for your treatment of your boyfriend. You completely disregarded his feelings. You canceled the reservation before talking to him. You could have said you'd be terrible company and suggest he keep the reservation and take a friend. You didn't try to see if you could get the food to go. You didn't offer dinner at home or any alternative plan. You didn't seem to really apologize. You just expected empathy without offering any.", "I\u2019m gonna get downvoted but NTA. Is your boyfriend an animal/pet person? Tbh I think dating someone with different views on pets will usually lead to conflicts like this. I know he was disappointed and that sucks but life happens (and this is coming from someone who LOVES their birthday).", "NTA. No one would be giving you shit if this was a sick child; people might not be able to relate to \"my pets are kids/family\", but that doesn't change the fact that to some owners, animals ARE family. You did nothing wrong; you can't change that your pet is sick. You can absolutely make up plans with your partner. \n\nIf my partner called me and said their pet was sick, I'd offer to come stay with them, too. Everyone saying OP should've left the cat.. okay, and why couldn't her partner come to her house if he was so hellbent on keeping some semblance of their plans?? \n\nIf my pet was sick I doubt I'd be able to focus on going out. There is zero reason her partner couldn't have offered to come to her place; the onus for that is on him just as much as her.", "Info: You say that the cat is in pain - did the emergency vet give you pain meds?  Or are you just assuming the pain level bc kitty isn't eating right now?  What were their recommendations? Did you tell them you had plans, and if so, did they tell you to stay home and monitor the cat? Did they mention hospitalization? Any mention from the vet about a cone?\n\nIn my 20+ years working in veterinary medicine, these are questions/comments that would be standard. And if you didn't ask specific questions, did you call the ER and ask if they thought you should stay home?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause if none of that happened, YTA.", "YTA. Not for wanting to stay with the cat, but for how you communicated it.\n\nDid you discuss it with the vet (you know about the dinner, so it would have been a normal question). Did you tell your boyfriend beforehand or did you just confront him. What effort did you put into making the night special for him and still be able to monitor the cat? A lot of possiblities there. But looking at your original post, you just canceled and told him he was welcome to come over. That's very low effort.", "YTA- but not for staying home with your cat, who is suffering. YTA for not first discussing canceling the plans with your bf. You could have easily called him, explained the situation and then if he still wanted to go to this restaurant he apparently is excited to eat at, take a friend or family member in your stead since you needed to be elsewhere. You could have even given him a card and some money towards his meal you weren\u2019t able to share. You have been together for two years, communicating things like this is important.", "Unless you're a feline eye doctor, what exactly were you going to do for that cat that night? You got her the medicine and you kept an eye on her and she's unhappy but stable. But fine. You don't want to go out anymore. But you then canceled the dinner entirely and asked him to spend his birthday looking at your cat with you? You didn't even give him the option of still going out to eat on his own or with a friend. \n\nYTA. It's great that you love your cat. And I understand that you may not be able to concentrate on anything else until she is better. All that is fine. Your partner may not want to be in a relationship where his milestones aren't important, and watching a cat sleep is more important than keeping special plans for a few hours. There were absolutely compromises available to you, but you didn't consider any of them. \n\nHope kitty is feeling better.", "Absolutely NTA and I can\u2019t believe how many people are saying the opposite. If you\u2019ve been together for two years, by now, he should already know about the importance of your cat. I understand his disappointment, but being angry at you doesn\u2019t make sense. If I was you, I would be planning an alternative celebration for him and letting him know. However, if he chooses to leave you over this, at least you know you made the right choice anyway because you\u2019ll still have your cat.", "YTA, but I'm glad for your bf that he gets to see where your priorities are: pets>people", "NTA - eyes are way more important than a birthday.", "NTA, your pet had a medical emergency.

When he was being a terror, he lives up to his name, he watched Jazz queuing me. After about a year Loki started queuing me, sometimes when Jazz was sleeping. Loki seems more sensitive than Jazz, but at this point Jazzy is a senior and his senses are dulling some...  I had 2 procedures to give me a medical induced remission.  Sadly 1.5 yrs later my left side fails, but came back slow.  I didn't know what was going on until Loki rushed up to me and sat staring at me with that look.  I didn't take my meds bc I thought it was my TMJ.  After a few min Loki gets right in my face and won't stop. Min later I'm in so much pain and scrambling for my gabapentin.  He's continued doing this since the end of July. He rarely leaves my side and while he was never a big cuddler he now lets me fall asleep with my arm around him.  During bad flares he makes sure to be by my head vs sleeping at my feet. He just purrs constantly and watches me. He won't leave until it passes.   Jazz, he's has done his que a few times since, usually the most severe ones IF he's awake. He is 14 now and is health isn't too great so I'm shocked he still does his magic.\n\n\nNow Jazz was from the neighboring farm, less than a mile from house to house if you walked through the pastures.

Without knowing more about the balance of her relationship it's hard to know if this was fair or not. If OP takes more than she gives I can see why he was upset. If she gives more than he does then he could have sucked it up. We only get a small window and these incidents don't exist in a bubble.\n\nI don't think OP is an asshole for being too anxious to go anywhere because they're worried about their pet. I think they might be an asshole for unilaterally cancelling an important night without attempts to compromise. Make a nice dinner at home. Get take out. Get drunk at OP's house. Ask him what he'd like to do instead that doesn't involve leaving. Confide their fears. But don't just say \"oh we aren't doing anything now because my feelings about my animal takes precedence over you feeling valued.\" She could have seen about getting a pet sitter or maybe even leaving the cat at another vet for observation if the risk was so high. There's lots of things that could have been done. She could have even discussed it first instead of dropping it on him.\n\nBased on the unspoken, read between the line bits, it seems like nice nights out might actually be a rare occurrence for them. Someone who takes a vacation day to cut loose the night before seems more in line with the actions of someone who doesn't do that often. He would have also had to have done it some time in advance.

She declined rapidly over a few weeks and she would have had no quality of life if we kept her on feeding tubes and the like. I moved my mattress to the living room to be close to her. Illness, including of pets, comes above fun imo.", "I had to put my 16 year old indoor/outdoor cat to sleep earlier this year and I feel the same. I'm quite confident he used all of his nine lives and enjoyed almost all of it.", "My best bud came from a pet store in the Okanagan - he was all alone as all his siblings had been sold. We weren't even planning to get a cat that day. He travelled from one coast to the other with me and was a grumpy bastard until the end this February, not too long before he would have been 18.\n\nI would have cancelled a hundred more important dinners for him.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve never slept in a barn for animal , or heard of family watching in shifts. You can doubt it all you want dude that doesn\u2019t make it untrue. Your personal experience is not mine or the other person you were responding to, and I am not sure why you want to discredit people who just love their fucking animals. You don\u2019t have to agree with it, you can find it silly, but it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "> so I cancelled dinner and decided to stay home with the cat, telling my partner we can reschedule it for another night and that he's welcome to come over and look after her with me.\n\nWhat about that sounds like there's still a reservation that exists? If the reservation was still in place, OP would have mentioned that the boyfriend could have still gone. You say it's silly to assume the worst but you're in the minority in how you're reading this situation and the language does not suggest the boyfriend can just go by himself or with someone else.", "He'll get his present an other time, he is not a 5 yo anymore. And he can go get his bloody dinner on his own if he is such a kid he can't celebrate his birthday an other time \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nNo one get a pet sitter FOR A DINNER, it's ridiculous, she deserves a partner that can understand that no you don't go out to party when you have a sick animal you are responsible for at home.\n\nShe gave a simple efficient compromise : reschedule the dinner to an other time.", "Why would you want people who don\u2019t have empathy for animals in your life? I\u2019d rather just have my pets than be surrounded by shallow relationships where they are always expected to be catered to", "Exactly! My cats mean the absolute world to me and if my partner couldn\u2019t understand that my pets health means more than a birthday dinner then they\u2019d have to go. What I don\u2019t understand is even if the cat didn\u2019t need immediate medical attention, why would you want to drag the partner out who is clearly worried about their baby and definitely wouldn\u2019t have a good time??", "How often are they going out to drink?\n\nIt could just be that he doesn't drink very often.", "I mean, it might be a vocabulary difference. But for me, going out to drink means getting drunk. It might be an error on my part.", "He\u2019s saying rather than OP just cancelling the reservation, she should\u2019ve actually talked to her boyfriend and given him the opportunity to ask a friend to go with him instead so he wouldn\u2019t miss out while OP stayed with her cat.", ">Grow up and reschedule\n\nOP needs to grow up and don't make choices for other people without speaking with them. She flat out thought well if I'm not going neither are you. That's what makes her TA here.", "My guy had kidney problems that developed rapidly.  Apparently dry food is not great for cats because they commonly get a large part of their water intake from kills in the wild.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.  8 years is not long enough.", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm sure he did.  You can't help but wonder what adventures they got up to.", "As much as it kinda sucks hearing about how many of us have lost our animal companions, it's really warming my heart to imagine all the good times we all shared with these little beasts.  Congratulations on 18 years with your little grump.", "I don\u2019t find it silly I just think you are recounting the experiences of your aunt and father. Yes, I\u2019m sure their animals were well taken care of and loved like family and I\u2019m sure on many occasions, they slept in the barn keeping watch over an ill cow or horse. \n\nBut unless you\u2019ve actually experienced farm life first hand, you probably don\u2019t realize the frequency with which livestock become sick or injured, nor do you understand the varying degrees of severity of injuries and illnesses that occur. Yes, some illnesses require constant attention for days on end. Some injuries take months to heal, and constant supervision would be impossible. And then there are all kinds of ailments in between. To say that someone never left a sick or injured farm animal unattended shows a lack of personal experience in this particular realm.", "Please see my comment above. I have absolutely slept in a barn. And I\u2019m sure I will again\u2014when it\u2019s necessary and beneficial to the healing of the animal.", "Its not a compromise if you decide for another person and they cant do what they wanted for at least 9 month.\nAnd yes, she deserves that as much as he deserves caring communication. We dont know how he would have reacted if she had included him in her decision for their date, which is important. If she communicated better and he would have acted the way he did, he would be the AH. But we cant know that. We know that she did not (and I am not saying I would act better when in sorrow btw) but that makes her TA. \nAnd maybe Im just really lucky, but I am pretty sure that I would find a friend to look after my pet approptiately on short notice.", "You missed the point of my response. I'm not saying have no empathy for animals. I'm saying people need to make judgement calls. \n\nOP cannot go to dinner with her partner but didn't mention larger time sinks such as work or sleep. Couldn't OP get friends or family to look after her cat?\n\nIf you want people in your life you need to make time for them.  If OP's post had been about how she was rushing out the door to the vet when she cancelled and the bf did anything but support her I'd say the bf was the AH. \nThe had passed the life or death stage", "you lot have no empathy at all istg. ITS HIS BIRTHDAY THAT THEY HAD BEEN PLANNING FOR MONTHS", ">My cats mean the absolute world to me and if my partner couldn\u2019t understand that my pets health means more than a birthday dinner then they\u2019d have to go\n\nThat's an absolutely fair viewpoint. However, you are also saying here that pets>people, so I don't know why you are pretending to have a problem with what the first person said. \n\nYou're saying you would care more about a cyst in your cat's eye that you could just get a cone for or have a friend watch, then celebrate a partner's birthday. You would care so little for your partner's plans and feelings, that you couldn't even put the effort in to come up with a solution that fixes both problems?\n\nThat is pets>people.\n\n>their baby\n\nThis is a little more unhinged, but you do you.", "Possibly but as OP said he takes a day off after getting drunk and he always gets drunk when he goes out rather than having a couple or just getting tipsy it doesn't sound as though it bodes well for the future.", "I don't know historically what their financial relationship looks like (they don't live together after 2 years together) but maybe she felt uncomfortable with that. We don't have enough info about them to know if that's a viable solution, imo. Assuming it is makes a lot of assumptions about their relationship and finances.", "I'm lucky to still have her littermate sister with us, so she does live on within her partly. We also got an interactive waveform printed of her purr, so when you scan it, it plays the purr.", "I love how quick you are to assume I didn\u2019t speak with the father I currently live with and take care of. Keep assuming I\u2019m exaggerating.", "read OP\u2019s replies they do not have any friends or family nearby. \n\nI don\u2019t get why you are unable to understand that a pet may not be in the stage of actively dying but their owner would obviously want to be there to ensure their safety. How is OP supposed to go out and have a good time knowing that the cat is at home and in pain?. \n\nIt\u2019s really frustrating that you aren\u2019t understanding that a pet in pain is absolutely needs OP more than OP\u2019s boyfriend", "Lol", "And that OP didn't seem all that thrilled about because of the cost.\n\nHow didn't OP see the cat scratching or irritated or acting odd before then? I could understand not seeing the cyst, but the cat surely was acting different for a while.\n\nWhy couldn't BF come over and do something on his birthday?\n\nInstead, OP tosses the whole thing aside for the cat that, according to another response OP gave, she just didn't feel comfortable leaving alone.\n\nNo vet orders for monitoring, didn't do anything precautionary, just left the BF on his birthday and cancelled the dinner and any interaction.\n\nOP should have compromised instead of cancelled.", "The BF also seems to have no empathy and would make a terrible partner for anyone who actually loves their pets. A compassionate, mature man would have taken her up on her offer to come over and make it up to him another time rather than throwing a fit about his special seasonal dish.", "Look if you don\u2019t have any empathy towards sentient beings just say that there\u2019s no need to waffle on. Also it\u2019s not pets over people if one is in so much pain they are avoiding food and the other has a birthday reservation most people who feel an ounce of empathy would understand that. \n\nYes that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying- I\u2019m lucky that my partner also cares about living beings and wouldn\u2019t dream of dragging me out if one of our cats if unwell", "Also plenty of pet owners call their pets \u2018baby\u2019 but that just solidifies that you don\u2019t understand animals or people that love them", "If he does that EVERY weekend, i would totally agree with you. But once a month is not a threat to her future."]}
