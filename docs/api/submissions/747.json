This was about the time school lets out. \n\nMy bus made a stop and a group of (i assume) teenagers got on. they were being very loud and obnoxious but  ignored them. They then made their way up to where i was sitting.  There were a couple of them asking if i could move my stuff so their friend could sit down.  I being fed up with the day decide to ignore them, thinking they would either stand or find somewhere else to sit.\n\nA few second go by and i hear to my left \u201cno need to be rude sofia the first\u201d (i assume referencing to the TV show and  calling me a princess). They continue to try and get my attention. Eventually, one dude grabs my book bag and places it on top of my lap and then sits in the seat next to me. \n\nI\u2019m trying to find a way to get out of this situation when the dude says \u201cif she has a problem then we can fight!\u201d I wanting no issues decide to sign at the guy \u201cwho are you\u201d. \n\nside note: i am not deaf or hard of hearing. sign language was just the first language i was taught as a kid, so i know basic sentences. I also sometimes use ASL to communicate when i don\u2019t feel like talking.\n\nHe then starts trying to apologise because he assumes i am deaf. He is like frantically asking siri \u201chow to apologise in deaf language\u201d. His friends are saying stuff like \u201cyou\u2019re gonna go to hell\u201d. \n\nFinally the bus pulls up to my stop and i motion that i have to get off. As i am stepping outside of the bus i half yell \u201chave a nice day\u201d and i turn back to see the same guy give me the middle finger. \n\nSo, i need to know AITA?", "created_utc": 1667339377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjmgkr/aita_for_pretending_to_use_sign_language_when_a/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
