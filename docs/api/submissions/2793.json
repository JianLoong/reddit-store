She met my father (46M) when they were both working at my grandfather's law firm. My mom was just a young intern and my das was very important there, being the boss' son. She also met Jenny, who was a secretary working at the firm, but had no interest in law and wanted to be an actress.\n\nWhen me mother got pregnant with me, Jenny also got pregnant with an older rich man she was seeing at the time. The issue was that the man didn't want to have anything to do with the baby and would have prefer her to have an abortion. She decided to keep it and my mother became even more closer with her, being pregnant at the same time. At that point, my grandfather died, and my dad inherited a lot of money. Jenny became really sad after her baby, Stacy, was born and wasn't up to fully acting as a mother so she moved in with my parents and my mom was the one that take care of both me and her baby. My dad also help all he could, by the way, but he was busy working a lot at the time. My mom finished school, she passes her bar exam being 8 months pregnant, but never ended up working as lawyer after that.\n\nJenny got better with her mental heath and keep trying to get work as an actress, without much success. So, when I was 7, she moved out from our house with her daughter because she found a role in an off-off-broadway production. Stacy and I had been raised as basically sisters and were best friends, but we were also little girls so it wasn't something really deep, I think. My mom keep having a lot of contact with them and visit then at least once a year but I mostly forgot about Stacy. I went with my mom to NY a few times in her visits and we watch Jenny on her show when I was 13. It was terrible, in my opinion.\n\nEarlier this year, a job opportunity came for Jenny about being in a televisiom show in Romania but she would have to be there for at least a yeat and could't bring Stacy. So, my mom offered her to let her stay with us. My mom was really happy about it but I was mostly indifferent. She has been really intense with me since her arrival, wanting to reconnect as when we were kids. I don't want to be rude but I am really shy and calm, while she is really loud. She is always in my room because she says she is too used to share a small room with her mom and does not like being alone in her own big bedroom in our house.\n\nSince last week, I started to locked my door so Stacy can't come in without me allowing it. I think it is fair because I deserve to have privacy but my mom says I am being mean to her.

Your mothers basically dumped the emotional support of an abandoned child entirely on the shoulders of another child. Shame on both of them, and tell your mother that the person saying this IS A 54 YEAR OLD MOTHER of a 21 year old. \n\nSo your mother, being the adult legally and physically now responsible for this other child, needs to get off her ass and do the work of getting that child emotional support (therapy) and some planned activities for socialization where she can make friends outside of putting it all on you. Clubs, hobbies, an art class, a sports league... something. \n\nAnd also, I do encourage you to, on your own, mindfully think about how you would feel if you were in Stacy's shoes. She loves her mom, but her mom is not putting her child first, at a really pivotal time in a young girls life,  and that's got to hurt a lot. If the positions were reversed, how would you want to be treated?", "You are entitled to privacy and also space.

She\u2019s not entitled to your personal space no matter what she or anyone else believes. You\u2019re entitled to your privacy, she and your mother are not entitled to invade that whenever they want. It sounds like she needs to find her own hobbies and learn how to be alone.", "The background isn't all necessary, but it would be good to know what Stacey was doing in terms of spendibg time in your space prior to the lock ... was she just barging in without knockibg, as seems implied?\n\nNTA for wanting private time", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wanting to retain your privacy and quiet space is reasonable, not mean.  Your mother invited Stacy into the home, not you.  Adults don\u2019t typically welcome houseguests into their bedrooms, so why should you?\n\nStacy, you and your mom need to come up with ideas on how to make Stacy feel welcome without placing the full burden on you.  Does Stacy have any quiet hobbies?  Does she like to read, knit, do artwork, build models?  Together you can figure this out.  This is a long term arrangement, so it\u2019s best to try to get this out in the open and resolved now.\n\nAgain, being honest about your need for privacy and quiet time is not cruel.  You can set boundaries and still be welcoming and friendly.", "Oof. NAH. You\u2019re allowed to control your space in my opinion, though admittedly it\u2019s your parents\u2019 house and if they disagree strongly, I\u2019d support their position. But i would urge you to empathize with this kid and her fractured and probably traumatic home life since it sounds like your mom is invested in trying to help her. Maybe find something that you can connect by doing? Or go sit with her in her room from time to time? You\u2019re not the AH at all, but I just feel awful for her situation and it sounds like your mom really wants to help her.", "NTA for wanting your own space and privacy but it sounds like maybe you should be a bit more empathetic towards Stacy since her mom basically abandoned her. It sounds like she's really trying to be friends with you (albeit a bit too enthusiastically) but that's expected since she has had to move to a whole new place with a new school. You could also try talking to her about this gently that you need some time to yourself too. \n\n>It was terrible, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, this part really cracked me up for some reason.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are allowed your privacy and everything you do doesn't need to revolve around Stacy", "[deleted]", "Okay, I have to say this as both a woman and a horror film fan, but there\u2019s something extremely uncomfortable about a woman being asked to move to Romania for at least a year and not being allowed to bring anybody who can be a contact. This is not sitting right with me. Not only am I concerned about the possibility of trafficking, but more so the abandonment of her daughter onto your family. \n\nAnyways, you\u2019re allowed to have your safe space and can control who can/can\u2019t come in. If she doesn\u2019t like being alone, she can hang out with your mom if your mom thinks you\u2019re being mean.

I hate being around those people they stress me out and make me uncomfortable and I start to get really pissed off cause I enjoy being alone and in a quiet environment. Also be sure to tell your mum that if she keeps doing this stuff it's just gonna make things worse so if your mum wants peace then she needs to let you lock your door and you deserve your privacy and you shouldn't have to deal with a person coming into your bedroom who you consider a stranger", "NTA", "NTA. Its your room, your own space.", "NTA", "Nta and some of these comments are wild. You have to be civil and you have to be kind.

I know she's in your space and you don't know her, which means yes you're entitled to your space, but please try to remember that this girl is the same age as you and has just been dumped in a new environment with nothing and no one. It sounds like she just needs a friend.", "deserves top comment", "Thats what I was thinking or Stacy might be OP dad's sister.

It would be nice fir OP to have some empathy for Stacy's situation, but it's ultimately on the mom to make sure Stacy is getting thr care she needs. OP is not her emotional support animal.", "Of course that's true, she wouldn't be doing anything wrong, but it'd just be nice y'know? I'm not even saying they have to be friends but OP should at least talk to her about why she doesn't want to be friends rather than just shutting her out.\n\nEdit: Can you imagine Stacy's AITA post?\n\nAITA for trying to reconnect with an old childhood friend?\n\nHi, I (15F) recently had to move in with a family I used to see a lot as a child because my mum accpted a job and I couldn't go with her for it. Me and this other girl (15F) were really close as children but now whenever I talk to her she's very cold and distant and has even taken up locking me out so I can't see her. I don't feel welcome in this house but I'm only 15, I have nowhere else to go. She won't even tell me what I did wrong. AITA?", "You forgot the part where she\u2019s always going into OPs room without asking to the point OP has no privacy.

Weird when people want to force kids to like each other or give up their privacy or autonomy for someone else. Dumb.", "NTA. Boundaries and space are important. That's why kids need their own rooms. Keep locking the door. It's not mean to swr boundaries. I would also remind her that you're not kids anymore and have spent years apart. Bonding again is going to take time and being constantly pressured won't help the process.", "NTA. She can go hang out in your mom\u2019s room with her since mom\u2019s got no problem with her.", "NTA, the pertinent backstory here is that while you two had some formative years together, you have been strangers for a while. Your mother and her relationship with Stacy is not relevant. You want your privacy from other people in the house. That is valid and you are not being mean by locking your door. She needs to figure out a way to adapt to the situation that's not your problem", "NTA", "NTA. You are used to privacy like she is used to company. Really NAH except your mom should stay out of it. I won\u2019t call her an AH tho", "NTA, just immature", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to their own privacy in their own room. No one is entitled to encroach on someone else's private space. If she doesn't want to be alone, she can spend time with your mom.", "So NTA - it\u2019s great your family is able and willing to help your moms friend and her daughter but you and she are not the same people as when y\u2019all were younger and living together (that\u2019s natural people grow and change and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that) and will add my advice in but please feel free to do with as you want maybe for a couple of hours after school see if there is something you guys can do together and you guys both enjoy it maybe that way she\u2019ll feel like you are trying to have a friendship with her (even if maybe a little more one side in affection) you never know you might find you like spending time with her and it\u2019ll keep her out of your room - the hope is that 1) she gets used to being in your house again and maybe not as lonely and 2) if she feels you\u2019re putting effort into spending time with her she won\u2019t be as inclined to randomly come in your room", "NTA.", "NTA - I am 37 with a 14 yr old and both of these mothers are harming their children. Your mother needs to STEP UP. She is taking in a child and it is on HER to see to the emotional well being of the child.

Doesn\u2019t make it right - just hard for the parent to see that they\u2019re in the wrong. \n\n\nNTA", "This is the nuanced take I was hoping to see. Poor Stacey is putting a lot on you, OP, because you're her only option. That's not fair to either of you. An adult needs to step up here. NTA to you and Stacey. AH to every adult. \n\nWhen you think it over, as Myay advises, maybe you and Stacey can have a talk about boundaries.", "Yo this, like they are trying to dump the full emotional and physical responsibility for this other child on you. It's wrong", "Yeah, Stacy's mom may very well being neglecting her way into being trafficked and something about is just so...what do you even do? Like, wow lady, you are abandoning your kid and it sounds like you've not been much of a parent to her prior. Consequences aren't always our kids cutting off all contact once they are adults, sometimes consequences are other things we could not have possibly guessed.", "Just because Stacy needs a friend does not mean that OP has to be that friend.  You can\u2019t force friendship.\n\nIf Stacy is lonely and unsupported, it would be kind of OP to take her to a few places and introduce her to some people.  But OP is not required to give up her privacy and pretend to be best buddies with someone she barely knows and doesn\u2019t seem to like much.", "YUP, reads like that to me.", "And the responses would probably be \u2018NAH, you\u2019ve both grown apart and you would be better trying to make new friends\u2019.", "\"I go into her room without permission because I need someone to be close to me cuz I'm unused to personal space\"\n\nYou are still trying to paint the poster as a villain when it comes down to this other girl is violating her boundaries for her own needs, which is still an asshole move. And the other kid shouldn't be tasked with taking care of this other child that's an adult's job", "And, IMO, this situation should also be NAH. I\u2019m not sure how Stacy can just \u201cmake new friends.\u201d She\u2019s 15, it\u2019s not like she can just jump in her car and go meet up with other people. \n\nI feel bad for Stacy. What a shitty situation. That\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault or responsibility, but like another commenter said, her mom needs to step up and help out here.", "I wish people would consider that Stacy may not understand boundaries as she\u2019s never been allowed to have them. OP is NTA, and having boundaries is a good skill to have, but may benefit from trying to see this from Stacy\u2019s side and consider how she\u2019d feel in the same situation. OP\u2019s mom should be taking a larger role in making sure Stacy is settled as well.", "I agree that making new friends is never easy, but at 15 she\u2019s surely at least in school, so has people of a similar age all around her, and maybe the option of after-school activities?", "And how long is OP supposed to see it from her point if view? Sometimes people don't listen or want to learn/change. Since the easy way does not stick she is forced to learn this the hard way. Her situation is sad but she better learns this now than later. Imagine if she ever moves in with roommates and behaves like this?", "Hopefully? But if she\u2019s only staying with OP\u2019s family for a year, it\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t enroll her and she\u2019s doing online school for a year or something."]}
