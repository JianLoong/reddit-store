She met my father (46M) when they were both working at my grandfather's law firm. My mom was just a young intern and my das was very important there, being the boss' son. She also met Jenny, who was a secretary working at the firm, but had no interest in law and wanted to be an actress.\n\nWhen me mother got pregnant with me, Jenny also got pregnant with an older rich man she was seeing at the time. The issue was that the man didn't want to have anything to do with the baby and would have prefer her to have an abortion. She decided to keep it and my mother became even more closer with her, being pregnant at the same time. At that point, my grandfather died, and my dad inherited a lot of money. Jenny became really sad after her baby, Stacy, was born and wasn't up to fully acting as a mother so she moved in with my parents and my mom was the one that take care of both me and her baby. My dad also help all he could, by the way, but he was busy working a lot at the time. My mom finished school, she passes her bar exam being 8 months pregnant, but never ended up working as lawyer after that.\n\nJenny got better with her mental heath and keep trying to get work as an actress, without much success. So, when I was 7, she moved out from our house with her daughter because she found a role in an off-off-broadway production. Stacy and I had been raised as basically sisters and were best friends, but we were also little girls so it wasn't something really deep, I think. My mom keep having a lot of contact with them and visit then at least once a year but I mostly forgot about Stacy. I went with my mom to NY a few times in her visits and we watch Jenny on her show when I was 13. It was terrible, in my opinion.\n\nEarlier this year, a job opportunity came for Jenny about being in a televisiom show in Romania but she would have to be there for at least a yeat and could't bring Stacy. So, my mom offered her to let her stay with us. My mom was really happy about it but I was mostly indifferent. She has been really intense with me since her arrival, wanting to reconnect as when we were kids. I don't want to be rude but I am really shy and calm, while she is really loud. She is always in my room because she says she is too used to share a small room with her mom and does not like being alone in her own big bedroom in our house.\n\nSince last week, I started to locked my door so Stacy can't come in without me allowing it. I think it is fair because I deserve to have privacy but my mom says I am being mean to her.

You\u2019re not the AH at all, but I just feel awful for her situation and it sounds like your mom really wants to help her.", "NTA for wanting your own space and privacy but it sounds like maybe you should be a bit more empathetic towards Stacy since her mom basically abandoned her.

Obviously, you should try to be kind whenever possible, but at the same time you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to share your personal space or have all your free time dominated by trying to make her happy. Her mother is a major AH for abandoning her daughter to practical strangers (to her) and your mother is an AH for expecting you to happily deal with emotionally babysitting someone and letting them take over your personal space. Your mom took on the responsibility and your mom needs to put in the effort to make the girl comfortable- NOT shove it on to you.", "NTA\n\nMany years have passed since you were both 7!

OP is definitely NTA for wanting to keep her own space private and chose her ability to interact with Stacy, but Stacy has had a really unsettled life with the moves and the job fluctuations her mother has encountered. The best times of her life were probably 7 and younger, so she remembers it with a LOT more fondness than OP, who never had much change except for her \"best friend\" moving out. Stacy needs to settle down and realize that her memories might be romantised and she can't push closeness. But mostly it's on OP's mom to enforce the boundaries that OP sets and help Stacy settle in and get support in other ways.", "Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself!", "Aha! Gotta say I didn't even think of that one. You might be onto something there.", "I don't disagree and would not call Stacy TA in this situation- but OP is certainly NTA either.", "I think her room is hers to lock, but trying to have a Stacy inclusive activity a couple of times a week wouldn\u2019t be a hardship. A game of cards, playing switch or some other game, going to the mall/library/park. But I am not in OP\u2019s shoes, only she can decide what is right for her. Even saying to Stacy, \u201cGosh, I\u2019d feel so alone if my mother was on the other side of the world, how are you doing?\u201d Would help. Stacy probably doesn\u2019t even know HOW to feel. Trying to make friends is a normal reaction to being left.\n\nIf your question is \u201chow long is OP supposed to try to see other people from their point of view\u201d, or, how long is the OP supposed to have empathy for fellow humans - the answer is probably never. It only helps you understand humanity and expands your own humanity. Sometimes you truly can\u2019t do anything for/with them, but most often you can, even if that is just listening.", " NTA", "NTA.

If you and Stacy aren\u2019t in therapy (separately), then maybe this is a good time. It can help you both adjust. It is kind to spend the time that you can handle with Stacy, and probably talk to her to say that you understand her desire for connection and company, but that you need to recharge sometimes too. Ask her to do things like leave a note or text when she wants company and you can reply. That way, you can say something like \u201cgimme an hour, then I\u2019ll come out\u201d or whatever you need. Be gentle with her, at least. She likely feels abandoned. \n\nFeel free to message me. I\u2019ve got a lot of ideas on how to deal with this whole issue.", "NTA, at all.

Sounds like she\u2019s either your father or grandfathers secret baby.", "While this ^ is correct please have an intense talk with everyone, just locking her out with little further explanation might backfire on you.\n\nNTA, obviously. You're an important part of you family and how you feel is important and must be considered in times of changing family dynamics.", "Y'all do realise that the kid is almost certainly OP's aunt, right? \n- \"older rich man\" sure fits a guy who owns his own law firm\n- grandpa dies, dad gets $$$, Jenny gets *super* sad: her boyfriend dying and leaving his daughter nothing sure would explain that\n- OP's parents, feeling guilty that one of grandpa's kids just got totally screwed over on the will, let her move in\n- family are very keen that the girls should have a good relationship\n\nExplains a lot more than it doesn't....", "This is where I land on the subject as well. It sounds like the family has the resources to get Stacy into both therapy and some extracurriculars. Those things should be highest priority for mom, and considering she may not think of it on her own at this stage, the least u/AwareOfClimateChange could do here is speak earnestly with her mother about them.\n\nAs for OPs main query, I think this is one of those situations where she absolutely has the *right* to continue her current course, but her refusing to try at all will still make her an AH. Based on how OP writes, she seems completely closed off to the idea of welcoming Stacy in any way whatsoever. Locking the door to ensure personal space is respected isn't wrong, but OP approaching Stacy's reaching out with this attitude generally seems unnecessarily harsh, especially given alllll the valid reasons Stacy has for feeling lonely and seeking connection and given that nothing deeply negative has happened between them at this point.", "I came here to say this but couldn't have said it better myself. \n\nThis is 100% on point!.", "When I was a bit younger than OP, my mom\u2019s friend was dying of cancer and her daughter (a year older than me) came to live with us to finish out the school year. We had a two bedroom house, so E had to stay in my room on the top bunk of my bunk beds. Like OP, I was the shy quiet type and E was much more a social butterfly. BUT my mom worked hard to make sure I was not responsible for meeting all of E\u2019s emotional needs. This is where OP\u2019s mom is falling down. \n\n(Yes, there was one day several months in where I dumped all of E\u2019s stuff in the hallway when I got home, but mom and I had a long talk and I put everything back before E ever saw it. Because mom acknowledged my needs were different than E\u2019s but we could work out ways to help everyone get their own time and space as much as possible while still dealing with the reality of a temporarily shared living space).\n\nOP, you are NTA for wanting privacy in your own room. It would be lovely if you could spend a bit of time with Stacy in the public areas of the house so that she doesn\u2019t feel compelled to try to come into your room because she is alone. But you are not personally responsible for all of Stacy\u2019s social needs and your mom needs to step up and figure out how BOTH of your needs can be met, even if imperfectly and with occasional compromise. You cannot be expected to be the only one to \u201ccompromise\u201d by always putting Stacy\u2019s needs and wants first.", "I don\u2019t creepy is the right word.  She comes from an entirely different background and culture.  She is accustomed to be around a lot of actors and stage people and sharing small, crowded places with others.  She is loud and raucous and a teenager.  But now she\u2019s been ripped away from all of those people *and* her mother and just dropped into this quiet, elegant home with her own seemingly huge bedroom.  Alone.  \n\nBeing solitary, private, and quiet is OP\u2019s personality and background.  Being loud and crowded and noisy is Stacy\u2019s personality and background.  This is a difficult adjustment for both.", "You're calling OP immature  not wanting to be available to another child every waking moment?\n\nSounds like hell to me. I really need some private time", "Please elaborate on the parent with anxious attachment style in the story, I feel you're reading things into it which aren't there..", "Yes, couldn\u2019t agree more. Boundaries need to be put in place.", "You\u2019ve just written a whole new narrative. Based on the information given, OP is NTA. Even if this other child was an aunt of OP, it doesn\u2019t detract from the main point, which is that OP has a right to privacy.", "Telling a teenage girl to let others ignore her boundaries because they \"need\" something is unbelievably sick.", "It doesn't change OP's right to privacy, no. But it definitely changes the way she should approach her parents about it - there's a big difference between \"I wish you two were better friends\"/\"be nice to the abandoned kid\" and \"I feel horribly guilty because we're rich on what ought to be this kid's money\".", "I'm telling her to think critically and use this magical thing called empathy (google it) so that she decides on her own to lower the boundary", "As someone who is also shy and calm like OP doing activities several times a week with someone that is \"loud\" as OP describes her would be really uncomfortable. \nSomeone OP is not comfortable with is intruding in her personal space for a prolonged period of time. OP is not feeling good about this either and the adults are trying to force a relationship. Trying to get some sort if cobtrol in her life back by locking her room is also a pretty normal reaction. Maybe Stacy should try seeing her invading OPs space from OPs point of view and show some empathy herself.", "NAH\n\nYou're not wrong for wanting privacy and for wanting to spend free time on your own.\n\nStacy's not wrong for being lonely and wanting to spend time with someone who, for many years, was raised almost sister-like, especially since she's living somewhere she hasn't lived in many years with people she has hardly seen since she moved away.\n\nYour mom's not wrong for wanting to help her best friend's daughter and probably feeling guilty about Stacy's circumstances, especially since you two aren't getting along as well as she might've thought you would.", "NTA - y\u2019all 15 and not 8, girl needs her privacy.", "NTA. Everyone needs their personal space at times.", "NTA.  Please recognize that while you feel like your space is invaded, she is also dealing with drastic change, her mom gone, living in a strange place, living with people she barely knows, and probably feels pretty isolated and maybe even abandoned.  I know those problems aren\u2019t yours to fix, but some sympathy for all she is dealing with would be nice.", "Maybe you could sit down with Stacy, and explain that you are an introvert and and that being around other people a lot is very overwhelming to you and actually exhausts you.  You could spend some time with Stacey but you have a strong need for and right to privacy. She really doesn\u2019t have to be in your room You guys could do something as simple as watching a movie, or hitting the shops. I could be really evil and suggest you get the two of you 23 and me kits just for giggles", "NTA. you need your space and this is a reasonable way to hold that boundary.", "NTA - It's not your responsibility to entertain this girl and it's out of line for your mother to expect otherwise.", "I was gonna ask what kind of show it was cause I'm from Romania and don't know any that would require this", "This. Like what kind of a TV production in Romania would be interested in a random small-time middle-aged off-Broadway actress, require a years commitment but would not allow for a family member to come with.\n\nIndividual parts make sense. But together, I just can't see it happening.\n\nI gotta wonder if Jenny didn't maybe go to rehab or inpatient psychiatry or something and they made up \"went to work in a random-ass country in Europe that's well known enough that it doesn't sound unreasonable or unsafe, but insignificant and out of the way enough that it would make sense to neither take the daughter with nor to go visit her\" so that OP doesn't get weird about it.", "It would explain why the father wanted her to have an abortion", "...well now I cannot unsee it. -_-", "It's parentifying a 15 y.o. She only has so much empowerment in this situation and she is exercising it but defending her privacy and personal space. I feel bad for the other girl, but OP should not be guilted into taking care of her needs.", "You'd expect trafficking to go the other way", "Definitely being grandpa's illegitimate child makes more sense as to why mom is so willing to take her in rather than being an affair baby.", "I'm reading it as Jenny was an anxious parent to kept Stacy close, so close that now that Jenny is gone, Stacy is internally (and externally) freaking out and trying to form another super strong attachment despite the foundation not being there. OP's parents should see about getting Stacy some therapy or finding her a hobby where she can see that she can rely on herself. Maybe baking/cooking. A person who can bake/cook has a skill that will always be in demand and break the ice when trying to make new friends.\n\nMy childhood best friend moved a town away and went to a different school and when I was invited to her birthday parties with all of her new friends, I'm sure I overcompensated--was probably too loud and too intense. Our friendship fizzled right around age 13."]}
