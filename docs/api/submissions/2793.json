She met my father (46M) when they were both working at my grandfather's law firm. My mom was just a young intern and my das was very important there, being the boss' son. She also met Jenny, who was a secretary working at the firm, but had no interest in law and wanted to be an actress.\n\nWhen me mother got pregnant with me, Jenny also got pregnant with an older rich man she was seeing at the time. The issue was that the man didn't want to have anything to do with the baby and would have prefer her to have an abortion. She decided to keep it and my mother became even more closer with her, being pregnant at the same time. At that point, my grandfather died, and my dad inherited a lot of money. Jenny became really sad after her baby, Stacy, was born and wasn't up to fully acting as a mother so she moved in with my parents and my mom was the one that take care of both me and her baby. My dad also help all he could, by the way, but he was busy working a lot at the time. My mom finished school, she passes her bar exam being 8 months pregnant, but never ended up working as lawyer after that.\n\nJenny got better with her mental heath and keep trying to get work as an actress, without much success. So, when I was 7, she moved out from our house with her daughter because she found a role in an off-off-broadway production. Stacy and I had been raised as basically sisters and were best friends, but we were also little girls so it wasn't something really deep, I think. My mom keep having a lot of contact with them and visit then at least once a year but I mostly forgot about Stacy. I went with my mom to NY a few times in her visits and we watch Jenny on her show when I was 13. It was terrible, in my opinion.\n\nEarlier this year, a job opportunity came for Jenny about being in a televisiom show in Romania but she would have to be there for at least a yeat and could't bring Stacy. So, my mom offered her to let her stay with us. My mom was really happy about it but I was mostly indifferent. She has been really intense with me since her arrival, wanting to reconnect as when we were kids. I don't want to be rude but I am really shy and calm, while she is really loud. She is always in my room because she says she is too used to share a small room with her mom and does not like being alone in her own big bedroom in our house.\n\nSince last week, I started to locked my door so Stacy can't come in without me allowing it. I think it is fair because I deserve to have privacy but my mom says I am being mean to her.

You\u2019re entitled to your privacy and your space, and shouldn\u2019t be made to feel guilty about that.", "NTA, but given the context, Stacey's mom is all she had for family and now she's been left alone, in a strange place, new neighbors,  no school friends, and her mom probably filled her head with stories of \"how close you were as babies\" to reassure her that \"things will be fine\" ..  when she basically is abandoning her daughter for her selfish dreams of fame. \n\nThis is a real problem. Your mothers basically dumped the emotional support of an abandoned child entirely on the shoulders of another child. Shame on both of them, and tell your mother that the person saying this IS A 54 YEAR OLD MOTHER of a 21 year old. \n\nSo your mother, being the adult legally and physically now responsible for this other child, needs to get off her ass and do the work of getting that child emotional support (therapy) and some planned activities for socialization where she can make friends outside of putting it all on you. Clubs, hobbies, an art class, a sports league... something. \n\nAnd also, I do encourage you to, on your own, mindfully think about how you would feel if you were in Stacy's shoes. She loves her mom, but her mom is not putting her child first, at a really pivotal time in a young girls life,  and that's got to hurt a lot. If the positions were reversed, how would you want to be treated?", "You are entitled to privacy and also space. Perhaps you can set aside some time to do something with Stacy on your terms which you would both enjoy? It can't be easy for her being away from her mum. But you are not autimatically friends due to history. NTA.", "Nta. It\u2019s actually really creepy and weird if she just comes into your room uninvited. She\u2019s not entitled to your personal space no matter what she or anyone else believes. You\u2019re entitled to your privacy, she and your mother are not entitled to invade that whenever they want. It sounds like she needs to find her own hobbies and learn how to be alone.", "The background isn't all necessary, but it would be good to know what Stacey was doing in terms of spendibg time in your space prior to the lock ... was she just barging in without knockibg, as seems implied?\n\nNTA for wanting private time", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wanting to retain your privacy and quiet space is reasonable, not mean.  Your mother invited Stacy into the home, not you.  Adults don\u2019t typically welcome houseguests into their bedrooms, so why should you?\n\nStacy, you and your mom need to come up with ideas on how to make Stacy feel welcome without placing the full burden on you.  Does Stacy have any quiet hobbies?  Does she like to read, knit, do artwork, build models?  Together you can figure this out.  This is a long term arrangement, so it\u2019s best to try to get this out in the open and resolved now.\n\nAgain, being honest about your need for privacy and quiet time is not cruel.  You can set boundaries and still be welcoming and friendly.", "Oof. NAH. You\u2019re allowed to control your space in my opinion, though admittedly it\u2019s your parents\u2019 house and if they disagree strongly, I\u2019d support their position. But i would urge you to empathize with this kid and her fractured and probably traumatic home life since it sounds like your mom is invested in trying to help her. Maybe find something that you can connect by doing? Or go sit with her in her room from time to time? You\u2019re not the AH at all, but I just feel awful for her situation and it sounds like your mom really wants to help her.", "NTA for wanting your own space and privacy but it sounds like maybe you should be a bit more empathetic towards Stacy since her mom basically abandoned her. It sounds like she's really trying to be friends with you (albeit a bit too enthusiastically) but that's expected since she has had to move to a whole new place with a new school. You could also try talking to her about this gently that you need some time to yourself too. \n\n>It was terrible, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, this part really cracked me up for some reason.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are allowed your privacy and everything you do doesn't need to revolve around Stacy", "[deleted]", "Okay, I have to say this as both a woman and a horror film fan, but there\u2019s something extremely uncomfortable about a woman being asked to move to Romania for at least a year and not being allowed to bring anybody who can be a contact. This is not sitting right with me. Not only am I concerned about the possibility of trafficking, but more so the abandonment of her daughter onto your family. \n\nAnyways, you\u2019re allowed to have your safe space and can control who can/can\u2019t come in. If she doesn\u2019t like being alone, she can hang out with your mom if your mom thinks you\u2019re being mean.
