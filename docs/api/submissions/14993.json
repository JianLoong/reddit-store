I'm not a person who believes in \"stick to your job description religiously\" by and large bc I think it's a good thing if you care enough to want to help out and make improvements to the larger company (as long as you're willing and being financially compensated for it ofc) BUT if you've been told to stay in your lane, then stay in your lane and don't waste another ounce of energy on extra effort.\n\nThat said management is likely to stop giving you opportunities if they think you're being like this on purpose suddenly, but between that and the environment in general I'd start looking for a place that will appreciate you if I were you.", "YTA.\n\nYou're only going to annoy people with unsolicited advice no matter what issues were happening previously.

She\u2019s clearly not able to do this.\n\nSo, stay in your lane and consider if you want to move out or move up(?). Move out and find a better team or all new job. Move up by doing some (not all) extra work so they can see who\u2019s doing things well when it all finally falls down (and it always eventually does). You could also let that be known strategically. Caveat, neither avenue is guaranteed to work perfectly, but sometimes that\u2019s life.\n\nHope that helps.", "Nope. Just someone who has pissed off enough people by being more concerned with other people's teams than the work I'm paid for.
