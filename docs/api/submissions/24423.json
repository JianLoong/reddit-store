It's calling them out when they need to be called out.  It's telling them they're wrong and acting a mess when they need to do better.  \n\nSomeone who only says yes and blows smoke up someone's ass isn't a friend.  That's a sycophant.  Friends hold each other accountable, tell each other hard truths, and tell each other off if necessary.  Friends help each other grow and do better, and that's what you did.", "NTA    she is a hypocrite, and a disgrace to women everywhere. What exactly is there to be proud about sleeping with a married man? I would have told her the same thing you did. There is nothing queenly about what she is doing.", "NTA. Everyone else is though.\n\n>she had no right to hate the girl her lover cheated on , if she herself did the same thing. \n\nThat's clear enough.\n\n>Everyone began defending my friend , and calling her a \"queen\" aswell as justifying the fact that she was with him\n\nWho are these people?", "Honestly, NTA. Sure you could have said it nicer but you really just told her the truth. I would want a friend to give me a reality check as well. Is there a reason why she wants to be involved with a married man? Does it stem from her past experience with her ex?", "NTA for calling it like you see it! She doesn\u2019t get a pass because she was cheated on. The guy is more at fault but she went into knowing the guy was in a relationship and that\u2019s super shady.", "NTA - tbh, youre right. They asked you what you thought, and you told them. \n\nMay and your friends seem to have a very selective memory.", "NTA - you said what a real friend would. And your friend knows she\u2019s wrong, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be crying when you told her the truth. She probably thought you all would be so supportive and make her feel good about what she did, and some of them did. But fuck that. That\u2019s not what real friendships and relationships are about. \n\nIf your friendship depends on you saying what your friend wants to hear, you aren\u2019t friends. Real friends say the things that need to be said, even when they\u2019re hard to hear. \n\nMaybe calling her a hypocrite was not the best Avenue. But telling her what she\u2019s doing is wrong is the right thing to do.", "NTA. She and the loser guy are both trashy.", "NTA. A real friend do what you did", "NTA.  \n\nFeel free to tell may to keep it up.  Maybe the married dad will decide to leave his family for her.  \n\nYou lose em how you got em?", "Eh you could've been nicer, but then again, she could've just not entered into a relationship with a married guy as well. She'll be called much worse by friends of that guys wife if it comes out. Either way, you're not the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just sad and pathetic.", "not sure. because after she got cheated on , she mentioned multiple times that cheaters are the worst , so her having an affair with a cheating man is just so confusing to me , especially since she seems so proud of herself", "As a total outside, my guess is she feels on some level  like she's \"won,\" as though having a man cheat on you is your fault and being able to get a man to cheat with you is a testament to your desirability.\n\nOf course, that's not actually how this works, but seems to be a pretty common sentiment among \"other women\"", "yeah you just stated the simple truth. im also concerned why your other friends arent thinking or saying the same?"]}
