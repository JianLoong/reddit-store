There's a difference between \"that's nice,\" and \"that's niiice!\"", "Thank you for the reply!", "Thank you for the reply mate!!", "That\u2019s kind of a broad jump. \n\nI don\u2019t like the word \u201cnice\u201d because growing up it was only used in a passive aggressive manner and it was not used as an actual compliment. If someone said you looked nice, either they didn\u2019t care what you were wearing or you didn\u2019t look that good. \n\nThere is a reason people say \u201cmidwest nice\u201d and it\u2019s because nice is polite but it isn\u2019t actually nice.", "Thank you! That's a very good way of putting it, we're still having a debate here and she loved this comment haha!\nMuch appreciated.", "Calling someone an asshole cause they said \u201cnice\u201d is an extreme over exaggeration and he deserves an apology in my opinion. NTA", "Crazy times mate! It sucks cause I use the word for the nicest things and it wasn't anything special she was just showing me the types of colours! \nOh well, I need a dictionary here.", "Hahahah, quality mate. \nIf it weren't over facetime, this would all be cleared up by now!", "Hehe you're not wrong there mate.", "Thank you for the reply! Appreciated", "Can you explain?", "[removed]", "I understand! Thank you very much for the insight!", "I've been with her a year. All things \"creepy\" has gone out the window by now.", "Because \n1. I go for haircuts and she says it looks nice.\n2. I said it looked \"nice\". Not \"Okay\".", "What? That\u2019s ridiculous. Are you seriously gonna be mad when people call your haircut \u201cokay\u201d? If it looks bad I\u2019m expected that people close to me to tell me the truth. Sure, be nice about it but lying is a no no", "Wow! Thank you very much, I agree. \nGood way of putting it, I appreciate the advice!", "Okay, so stellar may be a replacement for nice.", "Also look at it this way: how would you feel if every time you took your meat worm out she said \u201cthat\u2019s nice.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly the same but men typically don\u2019t model their chonies. \ud83d\ude02", "Nice is a word ppl use for describing biscuits...!\n\nYes love.\nBut I really like biscuits.", "Some people have these little tiffs as a form of flirting.  It's weird but you should talk to her and not phrase it how i did.  Maybe ask if she feels particularly more connected when you're both trying to persuade each other?", "Pretty sure she wants to hear something like \"You look HOT\" or \"You look amazing\" or \"I hope you were THOSE when you come to bed tonight\". \n\nTelling her she looks \"nice\" is a very lukewarm response, and something I'd expect from a guy who has no interest in being naked with me.", "Only got enough blood to run one brain at a time just a shame we've got 2 brains to pick from \ud83e\udd23.", "Whatever works for her would be best. I\u2019m personally not turned on by being sworn at/about even if the intent is meant to be favorable.", "No they're not right. You expressed yourself appropriately. You're GF is unstable.", "And if you don't know what a thesaurus, get a dictionary and work you way forward.  - Jim Jefferies", "What do dinosaurs have to do with words :(", "You don't actually have to pull out a thesaurus to know a few synonyms for nice looking. Funny thought though", "He asked for opinions.That's mine. Leave me be", "What does \"you so fine\" mean?\n\nAside from that you're an urban character in a 90s TV show, of course", "Depends on the context. \"It looks fine\" means adequate. \"That girl over there is fine\" means she is hot.", "Or noice. Really drawing out and elongating the word, especially the c sound ;-)", "I just read through the other comments and I love that you're reading these with her. It shows that whatever judgment you got, you were willing to accept it in front of your gf.", "So you have a stigma around the word nice? He shouldn\u2019t be walking around on eggshells he was being sweet and she decided to throw a tantrum over a word.", "I mean benefit of the doubt for her maybe it was your tone? Idk but if my bf said my underwear looked nice id be all giddy", "She wanted you to make the moves .", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She may not say, but she thinks something you do is creepy. It's one of the ways they keep you on your toes.", "you have any idea how self conscious society makes women feel? Being in your underwear in front of somebody else is an extremely vulnerable moment. She wanted way more than just nice, that isn't going to ease her anxiety. \n\nYou probably are sincere and believe saying nice is a positive thing in that situation but bro. just learn from this and move on knowing the word \"nice\" isn't appropriate for when your girlfriend is standing there in her underwear. Tell her how it really makes you feel", "Nice is literally a type of biscuit made by Arnott's and sold in Australia.", "Maybe she has real nice biscuits.", "Nice is a word people use to describe cars. \n\nYes, love. But I really like Ferraris.", "Hahaha, quality mate! I agree\ud83d\ude05", "Yea, even if OP used \u201cboring words\u201d its no excuse to be angry and call them an AH. We all know what OP meant, and if she wants more colorful words she could ASK normally", "Unstable is a massive stretch. Most young women are insecure, and would probably want to hear something a little more than \"nice\" from their boyfriend.", "LMFAOO", "NINE  NINE!", "Thank you very much!\nI'm very very grateful for her, I've realised over my short time on this earth that taking responsibility for actions/admitting when you're wrong is arguably one of the most important things of communication and can lead even in serious situations to a lot of laughs when you realise how wrong you were! Communication and understanding is key. \n\nThank you for your comment!:)", "I thought my tone was pretty excited, why wouldn't I want to see her in her underwear!!\nBut yeah, that's also subjective maybe I wasn't as excited as she thought i'd be.\nThank you for the reply!", "I should clarify we're in a long distance relationship! \nCurrently over 5 hours away due to work \ud83d\ude05", "Kinda important detail to leave out ."]}
