By the time we got out, it was pouring. But suddenly my sister ran straight toward the corn field. \n\nI yelled at her \u201cCome over here!\u201d And she responded with, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go home!\u201d and started to cry.\n\nAs she began to have a tantrum one of the festival staff ran up to me and told me to get back quick or we could get caught up in the storm, or more specifically a tornado that was coming straight for our area. I assumed that one of the rescue staff would come and save her so without thinking i left.\n\nMe and my sister both ended up fine and were able to get back to the main building at the entrance of the festival. when we got home I explained this to my parents and they got extremely angry and grounded me for a month they also told my relatives and now they all think i\u2019m a selfish teenager that doesn\u2019t care about my sisters life.\n\nNow I look back and wonder if i\u2019m in the wrong because I didn\u2019t help protect my sister so\u2026 am I the asshole??", "created_utc": 1667542587, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylqnmg/aita_for_leaving_my_4yo_sister_in_a_cornfield/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's 4. Tornado watch or not you don't leave a 4yr old behind because she's acting like a 4yr old. You could've explained what was happening and told her you guys can come back later.", "YTA\nShe's FOUR\n This was a major safety concern, and you needed to physically pick her up and move her to a safe location.", "I wouldn't even leave a 4 year old I don't know alone in a corn field in a storm. \n\n\nWtf. \n\n\n\nYTA", "You left a 4yo out in dangerous weather while you ran for cover. YTA. I don\u2019t really care about the rest of your story. Heck, We can shorten that to you LEFT A 4YO ALONE. I don\u2019t care if the child is satan reincarnated or an angel from heaven. You do not leave a defenseless child alone. \n\nYou need to have family counseling. I your relationships are a mess. I don\u2019t know if your parents make you babysit all the time or just forced you this time. But whatever the case, you were in charge and responsible for your sister. That means you don\u2019t run off and leave abandon her assuming someone else will rescue her.", "Listen, I have a 4 year old, I understand they are hard and stubborn but they are toddlers! Babies still! Sorry but YTA in my opinion. I couldn\u2019t imagine my oldest leaving my 4 yr old in a corn field alone during a storm with potential tornado. Neglect is always the \u201casshole\u201d in my opinion.", "YTA she is only 4... You are misplacing your anger for your mom's infidelity on her, she is not at fault for it.   How did your mom earn full custody of you If she was the cheater? Are you able to email your father? Call him?. Did you have a close relationship with him before?   If so check the laws of your country you might be able to choose if you want to visit your dad, but he would have to ask for it in court.\n\nI would honestly tell your mom.. she is hurting you by keeping you away from your father, she is making you resent them all, and if this continues.. she can be sure you will cut contact with them in the future once you are an adult.    \n\nAs for your sister, thank the lord nothing happened to her, it would have been in your conscious and your heart for the rest of your life, treat her kindly she is still too little to have a hand in how the adults screw up. \n\nGood luck", "You left out some vital details \u2014 what happened after you ran away before she \u201cended up fine\u201d?", "When life or health of humans are in danger, then such arguments...\n\n\n>have not had a very close relationship. \n\n> I\u2019ve been jealous of her because my step dad and my mom favor her over me\n\n\n...must be forgotten. \n\nAt 15, you already know a thing or two about responsibility.\n\nYTA", "YTA\nNo matter how much you dislike her and how bratty she is, you NEVER leave a child in a dangerous situation. If there was a tornado watch, I would not leave a child I hated outside. You earned being grounded.", "Ok so to be fair you are only 15 and an adult told you to leave, but you should've at least told them that she ran back in. She's only 4 and can't protect herself yet. Show some compassion and maturity, you are old enough to know better. YTA.", "dude. you left a *4 years old defenseless child in the middle of a tornado.* in what world are you not an asshole? \n\nYTA", "YTA- your parents entrusted your sister to your care. You don\u2019t just abandon somebody that young to fend for themselves with severe weather in the area. At a minimum, find somebody on staff to help.", "ESH - you should never have left her in that situation. (You are the biggest AH in this case, let me be clear on that!) That being said, parentification is abuse and you should never have been in that situation in the first place. Make it clear you are NOT her parent and not required to be here babysitter on demand", "It was wrong to leave her, but asshole is too strong a word for you.   As you mature, make an effort to think things through and try to make decisions that you would choose when you are an adult.", "YTA\n\nWhether or not you like it you were responsible for her and should have made sure she got out okay.    Assuming someone else is going to do it is irresponsible.    \n\nIt's not right for your mom and step-dad to treat you badly, but that is no excuse for leaving her in the corn field.  \n\nIf you could get past your negative feelings towards her and get to know her better you could actually have a nice relationship with her.    But it really has to be something you want to do.", "YTA. If some 4 year old I never met ran off like that, I would have gone after her. Just cause your mom had an affair, you can't blame the kid and let her die cause you are mad at your mom.", "Listen. I\u2019m not going to give judgement here. You could have gotten your sister killed. It was literally sheer dumb luck that she survived. \n\nUntil you can give some specific instances of favouritism and neglect, from your post it kind if seems like you resent your sister. She\u2019s 4 years old. Naturally she will take up more attention from your parents. \n\nI think your mother majorly dropped the ball, and should have enrolled you in therapy so that you could have a safe space to deal with your life. \n\nNo judgement because what you need right now isn\u2019t judgement, but compassion. All the best.", "Yea, hard YTA.\n\nShe was four years old. And your responsibility at the moment even if you didn't like it.", "your sister is four, and kids at that age are really a product of their environment. i know you have some negative feelings towards her, but i wonder if they may be misdirected. \n\ninfo: did the staff see your sister when they approached you?\n\nmaybe what you could have done is ask the staff to find your sister and made sure they had her before you left. \n\ni would really reflect on the root of your feelings because i think you may be projecting too much on your sister. i think a lot of those feelings are for your mom.", "YTA. If it had turned into a tornado warning or she had gotten kidnapped or killed or bitten by something and died, you would have felt terrible. You should feel terrible anyway. She\u2019s 4. 14 would have been a bit different but at 4 they don\u2019t have the maturity level to seek safety and take care of themselves.", "YTA because of the way you describe your relationship with your sister. First of all, she's only 4 years old! She doesn't know anything about tornado watches, etc. She's very much like a puppy, who needs to be taken care of, watched over, and led along. You don't even have to like her! You seem to think that she got frightened just to annoy you and make you look bad. Actually, she probably looked at that tall corn from the vantage point of her height, and thought that it looked like a safe place to go into with the storm coming. Like a forest. Obviously, she had no idea, so you have to assume the responsibility of your knowledge level compared to hers.\n\nNow, at the age of 15, you have the right to go to court and say that you want to see your father. That should be a separate issue. I know it's not easy seeing your family broken up, but taking it out on this little girl is just awful. Sorry that your mother seems to favor her over you. Maybe she does, but that is definitely not your sister's fault.", "YTA", "INFO: If there had been an actual tornado, would they want two dead kids or just one?\n\nShe ran off into the corn maze in a storm. So small, hard to see and life threatening danger on the  horizon. \n\nAre you supposed to sacrifice your life to try to find her?", "ESH - mostly the parents though and not the 4 year old as she's too young. You shouldn't have left a 4 year old and should have grabbed her and taken her to safety. BUT the parents should never have left a 15 year old to watch a 4 year old full stop! \n\nI think people seem to be overlooking that the OP is an actual child too!", "YTA because you left a very small child outside, unattended, around complete strangers, during what could have been a dangerous storm, without a second thought! very serious disregard for your sister\u2019s safety, you are very lucky she didn\u2019t get hurt or worse.\n\nadding on, i feel like maybe suggesting one on one therapy/family therapy to your parents would be beneficial here to work out the jealousy issues, set healthy boundaries about babysitting, etc.", "Super hard YTA, no question about it. I wouldn't normally be hard on a teenager, but, damn, you left a small kid in a cornfield during a tornado watch, that is seriously screwed up. Be glad you only got grounded for a month", "NTA. You're 15 and it sounds like it was an emergency response of fight or flight not a malicious act to hurt your sister. Your mom and stepdad are the ones that should be getting a proper babysitter instead of expecting you to fill in as a parent taking your sister to events.", "NTA. You are a 15 yo kid. There was a dangerous situation and you were told to evacuate. Your sister refused to listen and potentially put both you and herself in danger. You protected yourself.", "YTA wtf take a minute to read the title of the post. if you think that doing something like that is \u201cnot an asshole thing to do\u201d please please seek help", "YTA", "NTA.
