Wtf?", "NTA. What is unsafe about a food pantry. It\u2019s pretty hard to stay fed on pride.", "NTA! You got food you needed. Starving would put you in an unsafe position.", "NTA. Is there something about the food pantry or the area it\u2019s in that\u2019s unsafe? You have to eat, so what were you supposed to do?", "NTA.  Food is food.   I understand the \u201cpride\u201d thing, but in this environment nobody gives a fig about getting donations.   I don\u2019t understand how most people pay the outrageous prices for food and housing nowadays!", "NTA \n\nFood pantries/banks exist for people who need them. You had a need. Your BF needs to let go of the pride. If it bothers him to get food from a food bank, y\u2019all can make it a mission to donate back once you\u2019re back on your feet.", "NTA sounds like he has a lot of prejudices. I work at a food pantry. It is 100% safe as are I'd venture the vast majority of them.", "NTA, that's what a food bank is there for. There is no shame in using the resource that is given to you in time of need. Try to make it clear that it's only temporary until you find new jobs and helps you save and keep the apartment and everything else. I wish you the best of luck OP.\n\nEDIT: grammar :')", "NTA. It's sounds more like he needed to give you a reason other than his stubborn pride.", "NTA. And if he\u2019s so concerned for your safety maybe he should have just gone with you.", "NTA dude is too prideful", "Unsafe? Why? \n\nNTA - you do what you need to do, there\u2019s no shame in looking for help with the state of the world as it is right now. \n\nHe\u2019s letting his pride get in the way of your welfare and quality of life. I *can* understand that because society sometimes conditions us to see needing support as a source of shame, but flipping out at you makes him the AH.", "NTA. That's exactly what food banks are for. If it's a safety issue he could go with you or could have said that when he initially shot the idea down instead of not giving a reason. The reason is shame/pride and now he's embarrassed and took it out on you.", "NTA\n\nIf he doesn't acknowledge reality and overcome his pride - you have to cut him lose, he will only drag you down.", "NTA \n\nHe didn't give you a reason why which leads me to think it was his pride, which is his problem, not yours to deal with... you can eat while he refuses if that is the case...\n\nIf it is because the pantry is in an unsafe neighborhood, then he should have put on his big boy pants and escorted you there and back.\n\nPantries are there when you need them", "NTA\n\nSurvival isn't as important to your SO as much as worrying you'd be seen. It's optics for them.", "Typically, food banks by me are in churches, and I\u2019m not above getting some help if I need.  I\u2019ll also donate when I\u2019m not in need.  I\u2019ve even gone to the animal food pantry by me (once a month for those affiliated with a rescue).  That was awesome!\nI think your SO has some misplaced pride here.  \u2018Food pantries\u2019 are for \u2018this\u2019 type of person, and they feel embarrassed you went.\nThat\u2019s ingrained.  Get over it SO.  Y\u2019all need food.\nNTA", "NTA sounds like he's too proud, but pride doesn't feed you.", "NTA Sounds like he may have some shame around accepting help. My dad was the same way when I was growing up because he grew up in a household that survived off of help and he was bullied about it throughout school. It may be worth sitting down with him and talking through why he's so passionate about this.", "NTA that's what food banks are for.  If you need it, use it, and someday if you can pay it forward, do so.  Good luck to you both, I hope things turn around.", "NTA. You put yourself in an unsafe position? As opposed to the safety of going hungry? I get that people have their pride but dude is being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThis fight isn't about food bank being unsafe. It's about his feelings of inadequacy and shame of needing help.\n\nPlease look into all possible resources -- as you describe it you're a few months away from losing power or being homeless. You need all the help you can get to keep your internet and power to stay safe during winter and aggressively search for new jobs.", "I'm sure hurt pride is real for him but don't get the unsafe part. I've done some volunteering in food pantries and they are not inherently unsafe but guess that could vary I just don't know. Anyway stills seems like a massive overreaction to me NTA", "I volunteer at a food pantry every week. Referring to it as unsafe is condescending. \n\nThe fact that he says No, without offering other solutions is problematic. \n\nThis is a red flag. Time to re-evaluate your relationship. Maybe it would be less stressful for you to move into a roommate situation elsewhere without a negative Nancy dragging you down.", "NTA, but why does he think the good bank is unsafe?", "NTA.  Pride is hard to give up (IN HIS MIND)  I don't see anything wrong with it but it sounds like he does.", "NTA, he's trying to mask his shame and/or pride with the excuse of \"the food bank is dangerous\". \n\nHang in there, I hope things get better for you.", "NTA but getting laid off, you should try to get food stamps for you two", "NTA. Also, a food bank is unsafe? \n\nSounds like racism.\n\nBetcha he ate the food tho", "NTA\nHe's embarrassed", "Then he doesn't need to eat it.", "I\u2019m a little lost. Since when are food pantries unsafe??? \n\nUnless there are some major cultural references I\u2019m missing, NTA", "That is what food banks are for. Good for you, best luck in your job search", "NTA \n\nFood pantries aren\u2019t unsafe, he\u2019s either racist, classist, or just too proud and using \u201csafety\u201d as an excuse. You do what you need to do to get food in your family\u2019s stomachs.", "His pride is making it hard to do the right thing. I admit that I get food bank help, and it didn't bother me at all. I like food!", "My dads pride never allowed us to get foodstamps or go to food pantry\u2019s growing up, we just had to tough it out and struggle in silence.

That\u2019s a pretty broad description.\n\nNAH for now imo.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  \n\nAnd it could be your SO has a point of pride with it or doesn\u2019t want to take food that even less fortunate people could use.

Totally reasonable.\n\nI just don\u2019t think it is good form to immediately label the dude as an AH because it is a point of pride for him.  It all depends on how he handled it and how he moves on from here."]}
