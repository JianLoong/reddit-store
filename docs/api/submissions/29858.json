He met his girlfriend Bethany 25f through a work colleague and they have been dating for 4 months. At dinner Gabrielle and I were discussing flower arrangements and Bethany felt the need to ask George if he'd ever marry again.  George coughed before replying that he'd have to think about it, which Bethany seemed to deflate at. \n\nWell this caused Alice to cry about how she wants \"mommy and daddy to love each other again\".

George and Bethany stormed off, flipped me the bird and left my grandchildren at my house at 7pm.

It won't be a healthy co-parenting when Alice already hate every woman who tries to replace her mom . She needs more attention and maybe counselling. she had a strong reaction", "NTA. The audacity.

Four months is too soon for a new GF to be introduced to the children, let alone make comments to upset them. If he wants to see her, his choice, but he needs to respect you & put his children first.

Your son is very selfish and inconsiderate though", "NTA", "Nta. Honestly if he just recently divorced and is with someone so quickly that raoses red falgs. He also blamed his sister for his gf asking about marriage. Thats bull. He also seems to not prioritize his children. It seems odd to me for him to bring his gf around to his kids not even 6 months in. Amd gf needs to stay in her lane. Im the first to call out overbearing moms but she was just rude.", "NTA,\n\nBethany sounds like a narcissist who will try to isolate him away from his family by claiming you all hate her and she's not comfortable coming around. She also seems like she'd pressure him into marriage or even pregnancy to have leverage and control. 4mo and she's already asking? Insane. \n\nHe's taking advantage of your desire to care for the children without consideration for your input or respect for your concerns. He's disrespecting his children by neglecting their emotional needs and probably blaming his ex for not being able to provide for them, but that's not how 50/50 works. If he's paying child support and alimony its probably because his ex put everything she could into parenting, and it enabled him to have a career or at least way more than she has. The only time there's child support in 50/50 is if there is a significant disparity between parents and the state is trying to ensure the quality of care with each parent is on par to the other. \n\nI would sincerely consider telling your son that the charge for your childcare is working with his ex to get his girls in to therapy and counseling if nothing else. They clearly need it and he seems like won't put their emotional needs first without pressure. Also, if his children have insurance the cost of counseling for children is not that much. There is a long wait period, but it's not an issue of being too expensive. \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhen push comes to shove, he will either figure it out or the childcare situation may lead to a majority custody with the children's mother. Either way, that is *not* on you. \n\nIf he lacks the maturity to be responsible or ability to seek proper solutions, that's on him. \n\nAs a side note, your state may have childcare assistance programs for lower income households. It's possible his ex wife may qualify for it even if he doesn't. If one parent qualifies, they can apply and it will cover the children throughout the week (or at least it does in NYS). In my state, the parents can choose either an approved childcare center or an appointed person and the state will cover a portion of the childcare cost so parents are able to reasonably work.", "Congratulations, Ma'am,  it's a Boy-Child! \n\nDear George,\n\nYour business isn't your business when it's playing out in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME FOOL!

Your mother should take a switch to yo ass since you wanna behave like a spoiled kid!\n\nDear Mom,\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes our best just isn't enough, and our children become people we are less than proud of. Yours is George. You'd think that at 31, with one failed marriage and two daughters, he'd grow up a bit, but clearly, it's a no-go. For him to blatantly disrespect youn and allow his Chippy to too speaks volume to his manhood  I might suggest YOU be the one to teach your granddaughters to never accept a man like him, and explain that although most men can make babies; it takes a real man to raise them.

What a ridiculous question to pose in front of a new girlfriend.  I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate someone asking her fiance if he thinks he would ever get remarried.   Know your audience. She is really putting people on the spot for a theoretical question that has zero meaning.\n\nAnd obviously, your son needs to grow up, too.  He can't be so disrespectful to his mother and then have the arrogance to leave his kid and walk out the door.

If it wasn't a date, why were you taking care of the kid?", "What does your daughters happiness has  to do with it ? It was a weird wording \" \" stop acting like a child and be happy for your sister\" he never mentioned that he was not happy for her.

Bethany made a huge mistake and tried to put him on the spot because she wants it to be more serious but that's nto how you talk about a possible marriage in the future , not infornt of the whole family which would cause a drama no matter what he says.

If you agreed to it prior, then holding the fact she is in your house over him is an AH move. If he invited her himself, NTA. Same thing with the caring for the grandkids. Did he \u201cforce\u201d you into this role or did you elect to help out? If so, then holding that over him now is an AH move.\n\nI think you need to come to terms with the fact that George\u2019s marriage didn\u2019t work out. The reasons for this might be a lot more complicated than you know, the best thing now is to move forward. There may eventually be a new partner for George and things would run a lot more smoothly if you didn\u2019t ostracise them because they aren\u2019t the mother of your grandchildren.\n\nGeorge is an AH for getting angry, pointing the finger at his sister, abandoning his children and flipping you off. Incredibly immature. \n\nBethany isn\u2019t inherently in the wrong here (but if she flipped you off that is an AH move). She may have felt ostracised hence her comment about them being together.

After having children, he just \u201cgives up\u201d? Nope.", "This was my first thought. sudden lost spark, refuses any counseling and just gives up? Very high chance of a physical if not emotional affair.", "I would if I thought he could afford it. We might disagree but I don't want my son to be homeless.", "agreed with all the points except designating what is a \"manly\" behaviour and what is not.  \n\n\nThe son behaves terribly and does not seem to put that much interest in his daughters.  \nSeems that \"the flame died out\" because there is responsibility now and getting another 25 yo girl is going back to the easy and fun times.  \n\n\nOP, your house your rules. NTA", "My husband and I have suggested that George pay for her to get some counselling but he keeps saying that he needs to save and can't afford it.", "I disagree. This isn\u2019t OP\u2019s problem to solve at all. George either needs to step up and parent and not ditch his kids during his parenting time or give full custody to his ex and pay extra child support. George and his ex need to handle his daughter\u2019s therapy needs, not OP.", "I'm guessing they've been seeing each other longer than 4 months. She was probably the sidepiece during the marriage and thinks she \"won\" her man", "And sister's wedding. Or any other family events.", "I never agreed to watch my grandkids that night. That's why I had to call Susanna, who was annoyed at George.\n\nI just can't believe he is acting so immaturely. This isn't who I raised him to be.", "Yeah seemed like Bethany likes stirring the poop pot.", "Read it again. His girlfriend asked the question, not his sister.", "where does it says he is staying at her house ? He came to visit what is normal and babysitting is a huge help for working parents . He made his daughter cry and gave a f\\*\\*\\*", "Maybe he should pay a babysitter then.", "While I technically agree, he is putting them all in a position that is not great.  He should be far more concerned about the well being of his children than the girl he is shacking up with.", "Agreed. First, the issue at hand was not to ask George there and then \"if he was sure about Bethany\", but instead to ask him to comfort his crying child and show some grown-up empathy toward her. Thing is: you cannot control who he dates. But you can ask him to be considerate of his kids' feelings. And you can ask him not bring over a new girlfriend for dinner to YOUR house if the divorce is too recent, so that it is still extremely distressing to the children. (It clearly was.)\n\nYou are enabling your son not to be a grown-up. He clearly knows nothing will happen to him living in your house, even if he gives you a finger. This is insanity. You need to have a calm and collected conversation where you will tell him what your requirements are for him continuing to stay in the house. Minimum requirement should be polite behavior at all times toward you. Also, he should contribute to the expenses, like food and utilities, also possibly rent. Also, he should be saving every penny he has to be able to move out to live on his own. A 31-year-old man is stifled if he never learns to live independently without his mother. And you are keeping him this way. He is not a child. You think are you helping him, but you are stifling his growth into a responsible adult by having no normal expectations of him. You said he does not have enough money - if this is true, he should change careers right now or look for a higher paying job so he can pay for at least a rental for him and the kids - even if you baby sit them a lot. He needs to have a plan.\n\nThat being said, George is clearly an AH - he behaves badly. But you could have addressed this differently. And the real issue is your own lack of boundaries: you are letting him be the asshole.", "George asked me if Bethany could come 20 minutes before he was supposed to arrive. So it's not like I could say no at that point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGeorge begged me to look after his kids because he couldn't afford daycare and had to work long hours.

You say you wish he appreciated all that you do for him then show him  how much youre saving him by cutting off childcare for couple of weeks. You\u2019re enabling his behaviour by serving childcare on a platter for him", "That\u2019s understandable, but don\u2019t you think that\u2019s why he\u2019s like this? He knows you\u2019ll cover for him so he gets to be a selfish, irresponsible jerk.", "Oh no, there might be consequences for his actions! Heaven forbid.

But, I have no issue telling my son his behavior is odious and I find that unmanly - if he's being odious and unmanly, that is.", "So what exactly is he spending money on if not daycare or his kids?", "If he spends money on going out with a new girlfriend, he can afford it - he is just choosing his own fun over it. \n\nNew relationships usually go out and do things. That costs money.", "Has he looked into how much it would actually cost? I\u2019m assuming his kids have insurance, and with insurance, therapy is usually a small copay at most.", "She'll learn the hard way about that. How she got her man will most likely be how she'll lose him.", "Technically it is who you raised him to be because it is who he is - that doesn\u2019t make him being a jerk your fault, but enabling him doesn\u2019t help. Continuing to do him favors while he flips you off and starts arguments and leaves his kids for you to take care of is pretty fucked up and if I were you I would be furious at him. Watch the kids for Susanna and the kids, not your son.", "I get being upset at him,  I would be pissed in your shoes,  but keep focused on your grandkids,  not the GF,  because he will use any negative feedback against her as an excuse to further ignore his kids. Don't let him derail you,  keep focused on what the kids need. If you can,  don't even react when he's being a brat,  since he will also use that to derail the conversation.", "It's the fact she started it by asking if he'd marry again in front of his babies! Then has the nerve to cheek his mother and swear! Oh hell no!", "My mistake, I thought his son was staying there too. Which kinda makes it worse... babysitting the kids is a hughe help, but no... it doesnt give the babysitter the right to approve of who the parent introduces to his own kids. Please", "Then tell him that, but they are his kids. You dont want to see the kids if you dont get approval rights on who he dates? That's on you", "He should be yes, but they are his kids.

Don\u2019t make his feelings and Bethany\u2019s feelings more important than yours or your grandkids.", "I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this. Please look after yourself first!\n\nIf George is unable to care for his own kids, perhaps he and his ex-wife need to rethink their co-parenting arrangements. It\u2019s not fair to you and more importantly it\u2019s not fair to his children, who are clearly struggling. Perhaps Susanna could take more time with the kids?", "I feel you. These people laid a big egg during OP's dinner party and that was so not OK.", "I love my grandkids. But I wish George would appreciate the thousands of dollars I'm saving him each month.", "Considering the fact that he walked out and left his children there without a second thought, I don't think he'll care. That action alone tells me that he doesn't give two shits about his kids, only getting laid.", "Bethany", "I think he's saving up because he's planning propose to Bethany at Gabrielle's wedding.", "When did I tell him how to parent his children?. He abandoned them at my house.", "Not saying its neglect however its a terrible look just leaving your kids anywhere because youre pissy.", "If Susanna took on more custody then George would owe her more child support which he's already struggling to afford. Plus it would mean that Susanna would have to work part time hours which isn't really an option in her industry.", "What about just telling him you\u2019re only doing 2-3 days a week (without really intending to) just to have him scramble a little and put the fear of god into him and get him to stop taking you for granted. If he and Bethany flipped you off there should be babysitting for work only.", "NTA. Find out how much childcare for the twins would cost and tell George that you'll only charge him 50% of that. Let him feel a bit of panic for a bit.\n\nIf you're not comfortable doing that then at least sit him down and tell him to behave like a grown up. You raised him better than that.", "You need to make him see that by cutting off babysitting then he wont behave like a brat towards you. Is his fault he is paying alimony & child support by not trying harder at his marriage.

Especially leaving the child who was not long crying about his parents not getting back together and he didnt even comfort her - poor Alice!", "Actually OP said most of his money goes to ex for child support and alimony.", "1. He didnt abandon them. You said you look after them.\n2. You absolutly told him how to parent, because want approval rights on who he invites into their lives.\n\nYou dont get to tell him how he introduces to them. At all.

But yeah if he just left in protest and the OP was telling him to take the kids.... yes that's bad too", "This shouldn\u2019t be the case. George should not be expected to pay more than he earns. Sounds like George might need to cut back on his expenses. Also, why would Susanna taking on more custody mean she would need to work more hours?

That's abandonment. \n\nI also have the right to decide who is brought into my own home.", "You can't just leave your kids with a person randomly just because they take care of those kids for you. If this was a nanny or daycare, he would be paying over time or a fee of some sort.", "I think OP means that Susanna would have to go from full time to part time if she had more or full custody of the kids. She would have to cut her hours and it\u2019s not really an option in her industry.", "I mean, we don't know what was going on inside that marriage, but if he did just walk away because he didn't feel that spark anymore, then yeah, alimony and child support are the consequence of that decision.", "Hahah thanks! Well I feel as though you are a little dense to not understand that..", "Yes you do have a right to your own home, but you said \"into my grandkids lives\" to AND YOU DONT HAVE THAT RIGHT.\nThey are his kids, not yours.\n\nI never said your son wasnt TA too... probably should have said ESH", "First time I'be heard ofna grandfather called \"random\"...\n\nI have serious doubts that OP is telling an unbiased \"oh he just abandoned his children with me\" story. So yeah, if in fact the father just randomly decided on that day to not care one iota about his kids. Sure.", "I didn't call the grandmother random. I said you can't just randomly leave your kids with a person. As in, you can't decide to just leave a place without your kids if you haven't previously discussed it with the person who would be responsible once you left."]}
