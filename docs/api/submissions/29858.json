Four months is too soon for a new GF to be introduced to the children, let alone make comments to upset them. If he wants to see her, his choice, but he needs to respect you & put his children first.

He also blamed his sister for his gf asking about marriage. Thats bull. He also seems to not prioritize his children. It seems odd to me for him to bring his gf around to his kids not even 6 months in. Amd gf needs to stay in her lane. Im the first to call out overbearing moms but she was just rude.", "NTA,\n\nBethany sounds like a narcissist who will try to isolate him away from his family by claiming you all hate her and she's not comfortable coming around. She also seems like she'd pressure him into marriage or even pregnancy to have leverage and control. 4mo and she's already asking? Insane. \n\nHe's taking advantage of your desire to care for the children without consideration for your input or respect for your concerns. He's disrespecting his children by neglecting their emotional needs and probably blaming his ex for not being able to provide for them, but that's not how 50/50 works. If he's paying child support and alimony its probably because his ex put everything she could into parenting, and it enabled him to have a career or at least way more than she has. The only time there's child support in 50/50 is if there is a significant disparity between parents and the state is trying to ensure the quality of care with each parent is on par to the other. \n\nI would sincerely consider telling your son that the charge for your childcare is working with his ex to get his girls in to therapy and counseling if nothing else. They clearly need it and he seems like won't put their emotional needs first without pressure. Also, if his children have insurance the cost of counseling for children is not that much. There is a long wait period, but it's not an issue of being too expensive. \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhen push comes to shove, he will either figure it out or the childcare situation may lead to a majority custody with the children's mother. Either way, that is *not* on you. \n\nIf he lacks the maturity to be responsible or ability to seek proper solutions, that's on him. \n\nAs a side note, your state may have childcare assistance programs for lower income households. It's possible his ex wife may qualify for it even if he doesn't. If one parent qualifies, they can apply and it will cover the children throughout the week (or at least it does in NYS). In my state, the parents can choose either an approved childcare center or an appointed person and the state will cover a portion of the childcare cost so parents are able to reasonably work.", "Congratulations, Ma'am,  it's a Boy-Child! \n\nDear George,\n\nYour business isn't your business when it's playing out in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME FOOL!

Your mother should take a switch to yo ass since you wanna behave like a spoiled kid!\n\nDear Mom,\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes our best just isn't enough, and our children become people we are less than proud of. Yours is George. You'd think that at 31, with one failed marriage and two daughters, he'd grow up a bit, but clearly, it's a no-go. For him to blatantly disrespect youn and allow his Chippy to too speaks volume to his manhood  I might suggest YOU be the one to teach your granddaughters to never accept a man like him, and explain that although most men can make babies; it takes a real man to raise them.

Sure about what? They are getting to know each other. Do you think he can predict the future?   Mind your own business about his relationship.

What a ridiculous question to pose in front of a new girlfriend.  I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate someone asking her fiance if he thinks he would ever get remarried.   Know your audience. She is really putting people on the spot for a theoretical question that has zero meaning.\n\nAnd obviously, your son needs to grow up, too.  He can't be so disrespectful to his mother and then have the arrogance to leave his kid and walk out the door.

If it wasn't a date, why were you taking care of the kid?", "What does your daughters happiness has  to do with it ? It was a weird wording \" \" stop acting like a child and be happy for your sister\" he never mentioned that he was not happy for her.

Bethany made a huge mistake and tried to put him on the spot because she wants it to be more serious but that's nto how you talk about a possible marriage in the future , not infornt of the whole family which would cause a drama no matter what he says.

In terms of babysitting, who is allowed in your home, and directly expectations of him behaving respectfully and provide some reasonable not out of anger consequences, for example:\n\nPay $10-$20 a day for the babysitting. practically as charitable as doing for free but requires some accountability too. Agree to spend the money on the kiddos and or save it in an account for them if you feel uncomfortable with taking the money.", "ESH, except the grandkids.\n\nDid George ask you beforehand if he could bring Bethany? If you agreed to it prior, then holding the fact she is in your house over him is an AH move. If he invited her himself, NTA. Same thing with the caring for the grandkids. Did he \u201cforce\u201d you into this role or did you elect to help out? If so, then holding that over him now is an AH move.\n\nI think you need to come to terms with the fact that George\u2019s marriage didn\u2019t work out. The reasons for this might be a lot more complicated than you know, the best thing now is to move forward. There may eventually be a new partner for George and things would run a lot more smoothly if you didn\u2019t ostracise them because they aren\u2019t the mother of your grandchildren.\n\nGeorge is an AH for getting angry, pointing the finger at his sister, abandoning his children and flipping you off. Incredibly immature. \n\nBethany isn\u2019t inherently in the wrong here (but if she flipped you off that is an AH move). She may have felt ostracised hence her comment about them being together.

(It clearly was.)\n\nYou are enabling your son not to be a grown-up. He clearly knows nothing will happen to him living in your house, even if he gives you a finger. This is insanity. You need to have a calm and collected conversation where you will tell him what your requirements are for him continuing to stay in the house. Minimum requirement should be polite behavior at all times toward you. Also, he should contribute to the expenses, like food and utilities, also possibly rent. Also, he should be saving every penny he has to be able to move out to live on his own. A 31-year-old man is stifled if he never learns to live independently without his mother. And you are keeping him this way. He is not a child. You think are you helping him, but you are stifling his growth into a responsible adult by having no normal expectations of him. You said he does not have enough money - if this is true, he should change careers right now or look for a higher paying job so he can pay for at least a rental for him and the kids - even if you baby sit them a lot.

I don't think his gf did anything terrible by asking if your son thought he would ever remarry but when the question upset his daughter your son should have taken her aside, reassured her of his love and that unfortunately some marriages don't work but both he and her mother are still determined to be great co-parents. He didn't do that and that is disappointing - Bethany had zero obligation to do anything, she barely knows the kid. However, why the heck would your sons failure to properly comfort his daughter cause you to question his new relationship. One has zero to do with the other and I think his gf was very restrained in her response to you.\n\nYou need to can your opinions of your son's divorce and new relationship. His marriage is over no matter how much you may not approve. If you continue your behaviour then in a few years his girls will be old enough that he doesn't need a babysitter and his new wife (whoever she may be) won't want you around.

This doesn\u2019t make him the greatest  guy in the relationship department, that would include his kids.  Certainly, he\u2019s not going to listen to what you  have to say.  It probably provokes him more, so I suggest you stop trying.  He\u2019s not going to be happy for his sister.  Often people become cynical about marriage, especially after a recent divorce.  Telling him to be happy for his sister is not showing sensitivity to his current state of affairs.  You have two kids who have two separate sets of  needs. I also think the kids got triangulated in adult conversations.  They\u2019re emotionally raw  so everyone needs to be mindful of what they\u2019re saying in front of them.  It\u2019s probably best that your son and his gf were  asked to leave.  The situation was escalating.  A 25 year old challenging you in your home is not a good sign.  It\u2019s best that she leaves.

Managed to fit in a snarky comment when giving you attitude. Flipped the bird. She seems trashy.\n\nGeorge is allowed to move on. Though his lack of sensitivity to his kids is concerning. His deflection and tantrum are immature responses. \n\nINFO Why did he leave the kids? Did he seem to just forget them? Is it normal for him to dump them on you without asking? Did he not want them around to keep Bethany happy? Would they have normally been scheduled to stay with you?\n\nWhen did the divorce happen? \"Recently\" could be anything. Was the marriage failing for a long time? How mutual was it? Amicable or hostile?\n\n> Bethany felt the need to insert herself and tell me that she and George were together no matter how much I liked his ex wife. \n\nWhy would she say that? Was she responding to something you said just then or during the evening? Or had George already informed her you like his ex and have trouble letting go of the fact they have split? Either way, you would come across to her as impossible gain favour with. I voted NTA but it could be the perspective. You do seem to regret your son's divorce but it is done and it is his life.\n\n> Susanna is a great mother to my grandkids and I was disappointed in George for giving up so fast on their relationship without even trying couples counselling. But it wasn't my business or place to say anything.\n\nYou have never shared this opinion with George at all? Because your praise for Susanna and disdain for Bethany come across very clearly in this post and Bethany has picked up on it. If you are honest with yourself were you warm and welcoming to Bethany? Were your smiles friendly or bitchy? When she put her foot in her mouth did you scowl at her and say \"Now look what you've done?\" Was she so awful a person that you had to ask if he was sure about Bethany? Or had she lost your approval before she walked in the door? Were you passive aggressive at the start and after a dramatic child outburst you took the opportunity to turn it up to outwardly hostile? \n\nMaybe the perspective you give is all correct but I just get a feeling George or Bethany maybe would tell the story differently.", "NTA I was once a George sad to say. My mom started charging me for childcare and rent and all the other monthly expenses and it sucked. He's going to be mad and he's going to blame you for ruining his life but eventually he will appreciate it. He may be going through a rough time and that's fine. But his sister has a right to be excited about her wedding without having to walk on eggshells due to his poor choices. If he's THAT upset he is definitely NOT in the best position to be dating in the first place. Especially to the extent that she's living with you all. Tough love is the best option. I do like the idea of using his child care payment to you to set up a college savings account. Sounds like there needs to be a really rough conversation to be had between all the adults for sure. Expectations and boundaries are constantly shifting.", "NTA! You should have called cps on your son for abandoning his kids. His ex should call to.  And your daughter as the aunt. Sorry, I have no patience for parents who pull that kind of sh*$ on kids.", "Nta your son is an idiot who threw away a happy family & ripped apart his daughters lives because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel a spark anymore\u201d definitely sounds like he was cheating on his wife before divorcing. I am sorry you have to live with that. Make sure your daughter does not extend an invitation to her or give your son a +1 to the wedding, this has drama written on a red flag & they won\u2019t hesitate to ruin her wedding", "Or maybe George needs to attend daycare!", "That's what I thought,  as well. I suspect the spark was fine until he and Bethany had sex. Bethany also hasn't thought about what happens when HER spark gets cold!", "Maybe so. OP didn't give a timescale outside of \"recently\" for their divorce. Which may have been months or a year or so ago and on the cards for a long time before. There's no reason to paint her son as a bad guy for entirely imagined reasons. His lack of sensitivity towards his daughters is enough.", "She may have been his affair partner, so maybe a lot more than 4 months. It's easier for him to not add \"cheating on his wife\" to his resume....", "His gf didn't do anything overtly wrong... She asked if he would ever marry again. This dumb ass mom has no idea why they broke up, he could've been cheated on but she doesn't care, she's pressuring him to try to make it work with the ex if she even wants to. No one has ACCEPTED the fact that the marriage is over, stop trying to revive it, it is dead. Bethany saying they car together and to get over it, isn't that bad considering the mom tried to put pressure on him right in front of her.", "Nah. ETA. OP made it pretty clear she was upset that her son wasn't together with his ex-wife in this post. She doesn't get to be upset because she was called out on that. Especially since the conversation she supposedly butt in on was about his relationship with her.  OP says she pulled George aside but Bethany obviously overheard. This was incredibly disrespectful. Especially since at this point all she really did was ask George if he planned on remarriage. Not the most tactful moment but not necessarily nefarious. \n\nBethany's behavior when leaving the house was pretty bad though. Unless OP used some choice words she decided to leave out here it is a completely overblown response and completely unacceptable. She had every right to be upset but it doesn't justify going off like she did. \n\nGeorge just sucks. He had every right to leave his wife and OP needs to just accept that. Considering how much he sucks she was probably too good for him anyway. I hope so, anyway. For their daughter sake. George is just shitty.  How can a man not comfort his crying daughter? How can he just leave the house without his daughter?", "Letting her son and grandkids live in her house doesn't give her the right to say who can and can't be part of their lives, but it does give her the right to say who can and can't be in her house! As a parent, Grandparent and care taker she has every right to point out when there is an abusive person around the kids! This woman her son brought in showed who she was right off the bat and it wasn't pretty! She was dismissive to a child, and didn't care how the child felt about her parents split. Leaving the kids behind with no care in the world about them shows how toxic that relationship is and op saw that right away.

You should be a back up. Not primary.  It's blatantly obvious he's not stepping up for his children.
