I have four brothers (16, 15, 10, 7) and one sister (12). Me, as the oldest, and my sister, as the only girl, have private rooms while my brothers have to share, 16&15 and 10&7. Only Jay (16) and Ty (15) are important in this (fake names).\n\nJay has been annoying me for years about moving into my room when I move out. Like demanding that he has the right to the room as the second oldest to which I consistently shot down since that sounds like bullshit to me.\n\nJay and I don\u2019t get along with each other since he feels extremely entitled to everything and is all around ass (such as telling our sister she needed to lose weight and \u2018accidentally\u2019 breaking Ty\u2019s lego collection). \n\nLast week when I told him I wouldn\u2019t give him my room he went to our parents about how badly he wanted his own room. My mom sat me down and, while not forcing me to give away my room, heavily implied that I should give one of my brothers my room. \n\nA couple days ago, while Jay was on a camping trip with his friends, I offered Ty my room. Ty is a good kid and I am probably closest to him out of all my siblings so it just made sense.

Isn't it the parents' house?\n\nThis should be the parents' decision, but apparently they don't have the backbone to tell you \"when you move out, we decide what to do with your room, not you\"", "Your parents are the assholes. They never should have left this in your hands to sort out. They are the adults and they should decide who gets the room.", "It\u2019s your parents\u2019 house, they should make the decision as to who rooms where.", "NTA. When we were growing up, my brother and I were constantly told \"'I want' doesn't get\".\n\nJay hasn't made any effort to be a kind, considerate brother deserving of The Nice Room and he's reaping the consequences of that. Hopefully this is a lesson to him.", "NTA.  Your mother gave you the option of giving up your room to one of your brothers and you have done just that.  Now both of the next youngest brothers have their own rooms.  Is your room more desirable for some reason?  Whatever, you were told to pick one of the brothers to take over your spot and you did.  All that said, your parents should probably have made the assignment but apparently they wimped out and left the decision to you.  You had definite reasons why your chose the brother you did.", "Yta so you got a single room bc *you're* the oldest but its bs that he gets the single room bc now *he's* the oldest at home? O.o\n\nIf i was your parents, it would not be a choice. The next oldest gets it, and when he goes to college, the next oldest gets it.", "NTA but your parents are for not keeping the peace.

Maybe choose violence and give it to the 7yo.", "Info: Do all 4 brothers share or are they two to a room?", "ESH. First things first, it's not your house, I don't even understand why it is your decision to dish out rooms. Also, both of them will get their own room anyways so I also don't understand what's so important about your old room. And finally, just because you aren't as close to one of your brothers doesn't mean that is how this should be decided. Overall, all of you screwed this up, mainly the parents for allowing all of this to occur as it did and giving you so much power, which you don't seem mature enough to handle right now.", "nah, it\u2019s your room. do whatever you want to with it. NTA. and jay needs to get a reality chexk", "Your room, your choice. Tbh good for you for not bending down to Jay and enabling him more lmao, just cuz he \u201cfeels\u201d he deserves it, doesnt mean he actually does.

She should be ashamed of herself. \n\nYou did the right thing. All these people saying YTA and ESH are ridiculous!

You don\u2019t want to favor anyone? The oldest gets the room based on fairness. You want to based actions and responsibilities? You base it off who is best with that. And if you dislike the oldest but picked the one you feel closest that\u2019s picking a favorite out of them. \n\n\nThis will be an issue in the future\n\nNTAH", "Why do you even have a choice...do you own the house, the room???\n\nThis is an 'owner of the house' decision...and is not the domain of some pretentious sounding kid making decisions for the household as if he's somebody.", "I dont understand these people saying that room isn't yours?

The main issue is with your parents.  Its their house, not yours.  They need to get on the same page about what happens to a room when someone moves out.  It should be up to them, not you, because it isn't your room to give away.  Seems like Dad wants you to choose and Mom wants to hand it to the eldest, which is a recipe for a fight.  Meanwhile, \"Jay\" is TA for being a big baby about not getting to pick his room, and you are TA for going beyind Jay's and your mom's back to do something you knew would piss them off over a room that you don't own.  Even \"Ty\" is TA for not talking to Jay or your mom and joining the conspiracy to cause a bunch of drama.  A family of a-holes you have.  Gz.", "ESH.  It shouldn't be your choice as it isn't your house, but it sounds like your parents are playing favorites and are TAs.  Giving the private room to the next oldest kids makes the most sense if the previous logic for the private rooms was 1) oldest and 2) only girl.", "ESH, both you and your parents.  I disagree with your dad that it's your room to give away, but that doesn't really matter.  Your parents need to get on the same side of each other and you need to not do stuff behind your mom's back.", "So it is BS that being the \u201csecond oldest\u201d qualified to get him his own room, but not BS when you got the room for being the oldest.\n\nThat room should have gone to Jay if you\u2019re following logic. \n\nYou just seem to want to give it to your younger brothers because you don\u2019t particularly like Jay, which is an unfair way to do it. \n\nAnd since you dislike Jay so much you kind of screwed yourself because when you come home on breaks you\u2019ll have to share the room with him", "You're the golden boy to have that kind of power and setting your brothers up for more resentment and drama.\n\n Obviously Jay should have a better attitude, but it makes more fair and logical sense to go in age order or at least flip a coin for it or even rotate every six months to a year.\n\nYour parents are assholes for giving you that much power and control, when you won't even be living there.", "YT. This is not your room. This is a room in your parents house they temporary letting you use.  Did you contribute anything to the construction or maintenance of the house?", "ESH:\n\n**Jay:** seems pretty entitled. He\u2019d be getting his own room anyways. Is there something drastically different about your room and the room he and Ty share?\n\n**You:** I know you and Jay don\u2019t have the best relationship, but I think bias came to play here and you picked Ty. Seems like you never considered him or gave him a fair shot despite your feelings towards him. You could have heard from both brothers as to why they wanted the room. Also you kinda threw Ty in the middle of this.\n\n**Ty:** I think Ty is not the AH here. He didn\u2019t give in to Jay (at least that\u2019s how I\u2019m reading it.) \n\n**Your mom**: Your mom is an AH here because she fails to recognize Jay is getting his own room.
