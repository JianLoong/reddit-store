OP is NTA for literally doing what they told him to do. additionally, are you all ignoring the fact that Jay body shames his sister and breaks his brothers toys?? why does he deserve the room he wants when he misbehaves like that? he is the one acting entitled. he still gets his own room and by the sounds of it, he gets the \u201cbetter\u201d room so there\u2019s really no reason to complain.", "ESH.\n\nJay for obvious reasons.

Way to make you the bad guy.  Look, makes sense you giving up your room if you are barely going to be there.  But it shouldn't be YOUR choice who to give the room to.

I'd just tell your mom that you figured since Jay was the oldest he'd like to have the bigger room with the private bathroom while Ty will now be sharing a bathroom with the two other boys. Jay gets the bigger room and doesn't have to move. That should be a win tbh. He's just being an entitled brat at this point cause he built up the smaller room in his head and wants what he wants and is throwing a child tantrum about not getting it. They both get their own room anyways. Sure your parents should be on the same page here, but this is so stupid. Jay needs to shut up and think for five seconds.and realize he came out on top here.", "No, do not give Jay the room this entitled diva needs a lesson in humility.", "YTA\nThis shouldn't be up to you to decide. It's your parent's house and their decision.\n\nYour reasoning doesn't make sense.

The brother he trusts more gets to sleep in the room with his stuff, even if it means he himself would have to share with his less preferred brother during college breaks. \n\nI would make the same decision. I can deal with a bit of annoyance during school breaks, but the idea of the sibling that hates me having unfettered access to all the stuff I left at home would create too much anxiety. I could actually relax and enjoy college if the sibling that respects my space and property lived in my old room instead.", "It\u2019s definitely ESH, the siblings for thinking they have a say and they parents for giving them a say", "Dad is TA since he\u2019s apparently \u201cfully on board \u201c with OP using a bedroom as currency", "What I find a little funny is that it really doesn\u2019t matter how the situation ends, both Jay and Ty end up with their own rooms.

I was six foot 5, 260 pounds and I could not stretch out in that bed at all. When they bought a water bed, they gave my 5 foot 90 pound sister their queen sized bed because they didn't want the boy who still had to sleep in a child's bunk bed to be upset.\n\n\n\nJokes on them. Their 49 year-old son has never forgiven them for that bullshit. My brother was 5 foot ten and 150 at the most when I moved out. I honestly feel that it was abusive towards giant ass me to make me sleep in a tiny bed while my tiny sister slept in a bed made for two people.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, the decision this family makes very well might affect family dynamics for the lifetimes of those involved. If they had simply stuck with seniority, then there would have been no fuss except for OP fussing about not having his own empty and unused room at home.", "Not petty to take away a privilege because a kids acting out.", "There's 4 rooms between them.", "That is also why op shouldn't be making that decision. The reason needs to be logical, not emotional. Otherwise, somebody will get hurt... and a situation like this could cause an unhealable rift before they are even adults. 2nd child will be resentful of OP, hus younger brother, and his parents... and rightfully so. The family at large told him that his older and younger brothers mean more than he does.", "My take exactly. Everyone\u2019s repeating that it\u2019s the eldest, that\u2019s the rule! Rule changes when you\u2019re acting like a brat. Privileges get taken away.", "Is he going to share a bed with his brother? The other room sleeps 2, so likely has 2 beds. OPs room likely has one. So he'll end up sharing with the brother he doesn't like.", "Love this reference.  He had an interest in his own room from a very young age.", "He has 4 brothers only one gets the room alone.", "I don\u2019t see how it\u2019d be different. Telling something you\u2019ll do something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s set in stone. Circumstances change, promises break. If he\u2019s an ass he doesn\u2019t get the room.", "The better room should go to whoever gets along better with OP, bc OP will be sleeping in that room when he comes home from college breaks. Jay is still getting the better deal here. \n\nNot saying this is the only way to do it, but the reasoning seems relevant for a family with 5 kids - in my family, the elder kids only gave up their rooms after moving out entirely, not during college, specifically bc they still need a bedroom on school breaks, and it made sense for them to keep the one they always had. \n\nHowever the difference is, the eldest's room then starts getting used as a guest room. When we were young, the youngest kid always had to vacate her room for guests. Once oldest went to college, guests automatically got their empty room, instead of continuing to force youngest out. \n\nThe benefit of this is, as adults, when we come home all at the same time, we automatically go to our own rooms from childhood, and there is never a fight about \"who gets to sleep in the best room.\" Because nobody wants \"the best\" room, we all just want our own, and there was no switching throughout the years.\n\nIt also helps that the bedrooms in our house are mostly the same size. Nobody has an ensuite except parents, and even the master bedroom is not much bigger than all the other rooms.", "Yeah, he clarified what he wrote in the op more."]}
