She has Primary Progressive MS. Since 2020, we sold our house, moved into an accessible apt, she lost the ability to walk, so much.\n\nI've slept on a broken chair and floor so I can help (she has speech issues and I can translate - cant press call button). The UTI has brought on Blood in the urine, fluid in her lungs, etc, kept the fam updated in a group txt. 3 days ago I sent my mom + sis a text (edited for char#)\n\nWe've been here 3wks and none of you have even suggested visiting. Or anything other than words.\n\nEvery single member of [wife]'s family has been here more than once. Her mom and sis come here for hours to let me go home and rest. Friends of ours have sent GCs.

Would you suggest going to [sister] to help her for Christmas, or whatever?\n\n[BIL] is no less important to [Sister] than [wife] is to me.  Same with dad to mom. So why are we less important to you?\n\nMOM RESPONSE:\nWe are all so disappointed in you. Your family have been your biggest supporter through all these years and with everything you've done. We will always be there to support you no matter what. But today, I was so upset, angered and disappointed in your text. \n\nYour family let you know that we are here for you and if you needed anything we would do it in a minute for you and [wife]. But you never asked, and that's on you! We didn't even know that [wife] could have visitors.  I don't even know if we are allowed in the hospital. And that's on you! You should've let us know that she was allowed visitors and we could have set up a time in which we could visit her.  And that's on you!\n\nYou know that your family would be there in a minute to help you at home. I would've gone to your apartment and wrapped your presents, cleaned it for you and do laundry and set you up for when you come home. But, I have no way of getting into your apartment.  And that's on you! I feel as if you have distance yourself from your family. And that I find is very disappointing.\n\nI'm glad that [wife]'s parents and family go to visit her, as they should because that is her immediate family. \n\nI'm glad your friends do door Dash, etc. for you, but did you forget about the 6 months we paid for Hello Fresh?. We keep on asking you what you need and we don't get an answer, and that's on you! I'm disheartened at the way that you have spoken to us.\n\nWe value the time we have with you but it's mostly on your time. Just once I would like you to call us up and schedule a time for a visit. You have deeply upset us all today with your words, which we will never forget. And that's on you! I don't want an answer from this text unless it's an apology.\n\u2010\nSo is it me?

You\u2019re probably lacking sleep and are scared so emotions are high. Call and let them know you need help.", "Sister response:\n\n I'm really sorry you're feeling embarrassed of us.  I know that what you are going through is super tough.  I have in our previous conversation asked you if there was anything I can do for you.  You never responded. \n\nAt no point did you mention that we could visit or that [wife] was up for visitors as previous times we've or the kids have visited , [wife] was always sleeping and had to visit in the foyer which we happily obliged. \n\nI know you're in need of a big hug and I'm sorry i can't be there for you to give you one. It's extremely difficult for me to see you between work and kids. I'm glad that her family can see you and her as her parents are retired and have chance to be there.  I unfortunately, with the work we are in do not that have that option. As well seeing that I get most of the information about how she is doing is through Instagram I really didn't think she was taking visitors also because of the amount you've said you sleep during the day. \n\nAs for her mom and sister visiting for hours, do you think she wants me to be there for hours?  please remember I do not have child care for [son with Downs syndrome] as hubbu works, so for hours is impossible. \n\nNow with that being said I'm not making excuses, you've also never reached out asking for help. And on the group texts you never mentioned visitors are welcome. \n\nAs for saying or feeling that she is less important is something you've placed in your thoughts, we've never felt that way. \n\nAs for saying I don't value our time is something again you have decided to make yourself believe. Never have words like that be said to you.  \n\nAs far as door dash, she as we see on Instagram can't eat so...\n\nyou're hurting I get it but I'm not a punching bag for you to take it out on.

I imagine it\u2019s very tiring and very emotionally hard. \n\nIn the texts that your posting, your family seems like they\u2019re nothing but supportive. They\u2019ve made it clear you haven\u2019t asked. \n\nThere\u2019s a privacy thing to be mindful of. I have an extremely close relationship with my in-laws. But if one of them was hospitalized,  I wouldn\u2019t just show up out of respect for their privacy and rest. I would want to be told that I\u2019m allowed to be there. \n\nIm sorry, but YTA here. Your family is supportive. They\u2019re asking you how they can support you, and you\u2019re stomping your feet because they can\u2019t read your mind.", "I came here fully to give a N.T.A but no this is on you. They aren\u2019t mind-readers. \n\nYTA for not communicating with them or asking for help and then putting it all on them. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this but don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be. Tell them what you need!", "I, uh, hrm. ESH I guess?\n\nLook, you're exhausted, physically *and* emotionally. Try to put this aside and focus on your wife. Sometimes it's easier to be angry than to be sad, and if that's what is going on, consider a punching bag or something. Anything that helps you cope right now is worthwhile. \n\nWhile you're not entitled to anyone's time, your mom's behavior isn't great either. I can't imagine knowing that my daughter-in-law was suffering from sepsis and progressive MS, that my son had the overwhelming job of being her primary caretaker, and then I offer my help once and sit back and don't worry about it again. I also can't imagine sending this email to anyone--much less my child--who was in the hospital with a family member. She's literally telling you \"It's your fault!\" on repeat, with a quick side of \"You didn't even thank us for Hellofresh!\" She may not owe you more, but it's not thoughtful, it's not kind, and it's not considerate, and I guess we would all like our moms to have those qualities.\n\nPlease join a zoom group for caregivers if you don't already have one. I took care of my late husband for just over a year and I nearly drowned in it. Talking to other people who understand can help.", "YTA. A lot of hospitals are not allowing visitors still do to covid. It's totally understandable that they didn't know they were allowed to visit.", "YTA. They\u2019re not obliged to visit and, as was pointed out, they didn\u2019t know if you wanted them there or if they were allowed to come.\n\nWould I visit my family in hospital? Definitely. However, you\u2019ve approached your wife\u2019s situation in the wrong way.", "Soft YTA it sounds like you\u2019re emotionally fried and in a very tough spot. However, you need to properly communicate with your family as it sounds like they would be more than happy to help but haven\u2019t felt welcome enough to do so.", "ESH.  It seems like you reached out in your frustration with the lack of support from your family, and your mom's response was less than helpful.  It really seems like she twisted things around there.  I don't think it's fair to blame you for all of it.  I can understand them not realizing they could visit, etc., but have they called you to check in and see how you are doing?   I also think they should have had more grace with you, knowing that you are likely emotionally distressed right now, rather than trying to blame you.  In the future, saying something like, \"Hey, I could use some support here.  Can you come visit?\", would get you farther along.", "YTA. I\u2019m really hesitant with this answer, but your moms right. Your family sounds like they are willing to help, but some people need to be asked or told what you need, that\u2019s no fault on them, no one can read minds.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for everything you\u2019re going through, that\u2019s truly awful and I wish the best for both you and your wife. My best advice right now is to apologize for lashing out and be honest about the help that you need. Sounds like they would visit in a heartbeat, so tell them that. That you need their help and support right now and it would mean a lot to you and your wife if they were able to visit her in the hospital. With everything after COVID, it\u2019s understandable that they weren\u2019t sure if they were able to come visit. Some hospitals have a limited amount of visitors per day, and if your mom thought that the hospital had that, then she probably didn\u2019t want to take the opportunity away from your in laws to be able to visit.", "YTA\n\nNo one owes you the support you are looking for.  The way you \"called them out\" reeks of entitlement and judgment.  Your family are absolutely right to be angry at your message.  \n\nIf you want help, SPEAK UP!  People can't read your mind!", "Gentle YTA bud. I can only imagine how terrifying and hard this is. But for a lot of people, illness, especially a severe illness like your wife has, and being in the hospital is INTIMATE. It\u2019s a vulnerable time where your loved one is stuck in bed, unable to care for themselves, and suffering. It can be scary for family members to dive into that, especially for an in-law. It sounds like your family doesn\u2019t want to overstep, invade you and your wife\u2019s privacy, or overwhelm you in a time that you\u2019re already overwhelmed. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019ve expressed to you that they will do anything you ask. And they need some prompting. By telling you \u201clet us know how we can help\u201d, the ball was put in your court. It isn\u2019t fair to think they can read your mind and know what you need. For your wife\u2019s family to visit is a bit more socially norm. It\u2019s their sister & daughter. Your family loves her too, but they likely don\u2019t feel as natural - and it isn\u2019t as socially normalized - for them to rush to her bedside in the hospital. \n\nYou need to extend an olive branch, apologize, and ask if they can come by the hospital to visit and maybe discuss some ways they can help you out at home while you\u2019re tending to your wife in the hospital. Otherwise you risk losing what looks to be a very strong part of your support system for good.", "I don't understand these Y-T-A votes at all. Your mother's response was very judgmental and angry. In your exhaustion and grief, did you perhaps take out your frustration on your family? Its possible - but its also understandable. If one of my kids reached out to me to express feeling alone & abandoned by me, I sure as heck wouldn't respond with \"well, that's on you!\" \n\nCould you have responded to there \"hey, let us know what you need\" texts? Sure, but you have a lot on your plate. Your family could have been specific - \"can we visit? good, when? can we come over and clean? can we bring you food? are you getting any rest?\" etc. Specific items that you could respond to. That's how family supports each other. \n\nNTA. \n\nLastly, I'm so sorry about your wife. I hope she is feeling better soon.

I was in a similar situation with my husband developing a chronic, debilitating illness. His OWN family did almost nothing to assist us unless it was what they wanted to do, which was take the kids. I needed help with watching him sometimes so I could run to the grocery store, take the kids to birthday parties or sports. He couldn\u2019t be left alone. They always had an excuse.  \n\nI generally agree with others who say people don\u2019t know what to do to help unless you tell them.

His family, nothing. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a caregiver, your family knows you\u2019re struggling. You\u2019re stressed, overwhelmed, and desperate.

You are spending every second with your wife, caring for her and ensuring she gets the medical care she needs. The least they can do is reach out and not ignore you like everything's fine.

Who cares if they can do dishes and help you in many ways if they can be so brutal with words? They could have been more diplomatic and kinder, saying sorry for the misunderstanding, we did not know what was happening, make sure next time to tell us if you need us.", "Yes you are being gaslighted by your awful mom and family. Cut contact and be with the people that care for you. UTI's are awful and hope your wife gets better soon. NTA", "I'm going to have to go with NAH. It sounds like your mom is a little resentful because she's done some things for you and hasn't felt like it's been reciprocated, and I do understand your view point. Part of helping people is taking on their mental load, so they should be able to assume what needs done. My parents 100% would show up to the hospital and stay for a while, and when leaving they'd take my key and we'd later be going home to a clean house with a full fridge and their company if needed/wanted. \n\nTo me, it sounds like you need to apologize for not tending to your mother's needs in the past and reiterate you'll try your best to be more considerate of them in the future, and also clarify with her that what you need right now is to feel cared for by having someone step in and start making some low-level decisions on your behalf because you're stressed and exhausted. Don't compare halves of the family. Just state what you need. Both sides have unmet needs, and while yours seem much more urgent and severe, she's a human being and needs to receive in addition to giving. It sounds like you're having long term problems with your wife, and while you agreed to in sickness and in health, your family did not, so there's only so much you can expect her to do without feeling appreciated (and it sounds like she'd feel appreciated not by thank yous, but by visits).\n\nThe biggest thing that caused me to go with NAH instead of NTA is your mother saying she's asked multiple times what you need and you've not said anything. If you want things and people are asking, you do need to tell them. If she's not actually asking, it unfortunately sounds like you may need to ask", "NTA - a huge part of being a helpful and supportive family member is taking some of the emotional burden off their loved ones. That includes them doing the mental work of offering helpful suggestions for what they can do within their means/lives. If they actually wanted to be helpful they would check in and offer actual tangible help, like seeing if you had eaten and bringing/ordering food for you, offering to bring you clean clothes, or how long they could stay at what specific time so you could run home to shower & take care of yourself.

I hope you are both doing well. Focus on your wife and your family and friends that support you.", "Oh OP, I don't have a call to make here, because I've been on multiple sides of this and it's just the worst. I hope your wife recovers as much as is possible and you both have some quality time left together.\n\nIt seems like there's a bit of a communication style mismatch here, and some amount of your family not knowing what to do/not wanting to overstep so only doing things if specifically asked. \n\nBeing a primary caretaker is so difficult and when I've been that person it's hard AF to figure out what you need, who to ask for it, and coordinate that support. It sounds like your family may not have experienced caring for anyone in this type of situation, and so can't even make educated guesses, which makes it even more difficult.\n\nI'd make a list of the types of support you've received, and the types you haven't that might be helpful, and then give that to your family. Include your own needs- you still need to eat and sleep and do other tasks, or even just take breaks. If this feels too overwhelming, ask a close friend or your wife's family to do this on your behalf. Also, if you want them to provide support without needing to reach out and ask each time, maybe make it so they do some recurring supportive action. Maybe that's them taking you to lunch/sending food in whatever form on a specific day each week. The whole offer vs. wait to be asked thing is difficult.\n\nAlso, what your sister said - about having her own caregiving work that limits her availability - may mean that she's provided the help she can but while she loves and cares for you, doesn't have the time/money to do more. I'd treat her separately from your parents, and try and accept that this may be the best she can do. \n\nI don't think you're entirely wrong to feel as you do, or at least I have felt the same way at points when I was in a similar situation. \n\nDo you have a caregiver support group and/or your own therapist?

I can also understand their side too as if I'm in the hospital, no one on my husband's side would be expected to show up. It's a courtesy thing for us. Be transparent and tell them what you are wanting so they can help. You can be upset, but I think you are reading way too deep into this. I take care of my disabled child and if I need help, I ask. If I need a ten minute break, I ask. If I want a hug, I'll ask, ect. People aren't mind readers. It is clear that you are not in the best frame of mind right now, and that is okay.

And while it would be one thing if they just said \"I'm sorry we haven't been there for you in the way you need\" and then made an offer or a suggestion, they've added a lot of guilting and blame where it's not helpful or needed.\n\nWhen my dad was dying, I reached out to an old friend to talk, for support. She ended up blowing off that conversation. I sent her a long message sort of like yours, and she: apologized, said she appreciated being told how I felt, promised not to do anything like that again if I would allow her to still be part of my support system, talked with me regularly (including the day after he died), and sent me a care package totally unbidden. Not a word about what I should have done differently, note. Other friends did so much for me in that time, or later on when I was bedridden after COVID. None of them put it on me to figure out what to ask for like your family is (they either just did it or they made specific offers/suggestions), or guilted me for needing support or having some difficult emotions. So while I think everybody could have communicated better here, and people don't always know what to do and so they freeze...

The only one who didn't donate money. \n\nI do think a lot of the emotion is where you're coming from. Not looking for a scapegoat per se, but finding something that makes me angry and having it amplified by my exhaustion which doesnt help either, but I was hoping that even if it came across that way they'd be able to see it all over me and recognize it.\n\nCaregivers go through so much without being able to pop our heads up to ask for help. We're too in the weeds and get lost in it. I'm sorry you were in that position at all - its the worst feeling.

But seeing your sister's reply, too, makes me think they really dont know what you want and need. I've had similar exhanges when Ive been burnt out, and desperately upset with a lack of support. You don't need extra drama right now, it will only make things harder, but you also need support. So, get what you need from this thread, I'd highly suggest not wasting time trying to convince a bunch of Y-T-As why youre right though, and focus on your optioms and what youre going to do going forward.\n\nYou can just ignore them all and focus on your in laws and friends support, or from a support group (ask the hospital, they have resources for people exactly in your position). This is not an invalid option, anything else might be too much for you, thats okay.\n\nYou can focus your energy on just getting to a good spot with your sister (she seems the more understanding of the 2).

Are they also able to translate or would them being in the room with your wife while you went home and slept or whatever stress your wife out more? Her family has known her all her life they probably can translate and bring comfort just by being there, where it is not unreasonable to think that your wife may not want to spend three hours with her inlaws sitting next to her unable to communicate. As your sister said, you are going through a lot, and you need support, but they cannot be your punching bag. She cannot abandon her own responsibilities to relieve yours without making arrangements which means she needs info from you- what time is the best for your wife and you, so she can make sure she has care for her kid and rearrange work and how long she will need to be there in order for her to plan how she will do it. If your parents are still working, they also need to know in advance, whether they can both come or just one at a time, if they need to take off from qork so that they are not disrupting medical procedures that always happen at shift changes etc..

You dodge questions about how often you\u2019ve helped your sister with her son, which leads me to believe that you haven\u2019t, really. And yet expect her to find suitable childcare and spend several hours when you guys by all accounts have adequate support from your wife\u2019s family and your friends. I get that it would be nice if your sister could plan a visit, but you\u2019re lending no regard to the fact that it sounds like she has a lot going on too.", "ESH.

That is a selfish and unrealistic expectation especially because you do not clearly have that type of relationship. Before this crisis, have you assisted your sister with her special needs child without her asking? How old are your parents? Do they work, or are they retired? Do they have health issues they are managing?

I would not just assume you all wanted visitors. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I think your family was perfect. I think they should have done more, but it sounds like you were pretty noncommunicative about your needs. And so they defaulted to just not getting too involved. That\u2019s not great and they should work on that, but I think you should get \u201cbeyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing\u201d and begin healing the relationship with your family.

So the hospitalization didn\u2019t necessarily register to the family since wife is always \u201csick\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH. I think everyone needs to work on communicating better. Husband needs to identify and articulate what he needs specifically, and it would help if the family did a little work around what is helpful for people living with chronic, progressive illnesses.

But, other than them, no one else was invited to the hospital and I'd have been very annoyed if anyone else showed up.\n\nMost people who are in the hospital aren't interested in entertaining visitors. As a caretaker, I'm sure you'd like a break. However, I don't know what time you want to eat, what you want to eat, whether you need a walk now or if you're about to have a very important meeting with the doctor.

The tone of their response is the direct result of yours.  I understand you are under unbelievable stress and that it can be hard to even find the energy to tell people what you want. But as someone who cared for a very ill spouse for several years while he went through chemo, I learned that lots of people wanted to help, but many were worried about intruding\u2014including close family members.

Some of my favorite friends will happily do anything you ask, but you definitely have to ask.

Please actually read the OP before commenting", "It's so much easier to accept type twos for who they are (will only do what is asked and nothing more) and either ask or give up hope. I have family that are type two, it's super disappointing to me who is a type one. But nothing that I do it say with change it. They will never ask what they can do to help, I can't change that.

You gotta work with the family you have.  Her family will just show up, yours won't.  Neither of those is \"right,\" even if one is better for what you need right now.

They got all that with knowledge and practice. \nIt sounds like your mom sends you groceries and otherwise your family\u2019s requests for how to help go unanswered. But you want them to act as though you did answer them. Which you clearly must have done at some point to your wife\u2019s family.

I know you are there for communication and on alert for that but she\u2019s probably sleeping a lot. So do you not have time to send any texts to your family and ask or respond to things? You are on Reddit providing tons of answers and comments back to the post. I\u2019ve sat long hours at the hospital for family members so they aren\u2019t alone and we know what\u2019s going on with their care.

He's carrying a tremendous emotional load, exhausted, busy trying to help his wife as best he can, and so focused on her he may not know what he needs because he isn't thinking about himself.

We'd be at the hospital at the very least for moral support for our son and granddaughter, not waiting for them to call.", "Exactly.

Sure, they could keep asking, but from their point of view if they ask he he doesn\u2019t respond maybe that\u2019s his way of asking for space. No response is a form of communication.

We will always be there to support you no matter what. \n\nIt sounds like there are deeper issues and he has been drowning for awhile (and yet they paid for HelloFresh for 6 whole months). I just feel like either OP has asked for help and has not received it (or is too proud to ask for help) AND/OR OP's family is not supportive of his relationship. The mom later brings up the wife.

In a perfect world, we\u2019d all be present and capable enough to delegate exactly what we need done, but when you\u2019re in that situation (especially for weeks on end, and definitely in an end of life scenario), you can barely scrape together the capacity to ask for a coffee, let alone plan out who can do what and when.", "Well, that doesn\u2019t fly with my family. We keep calling until we get an answer so they can know we are available to help . Same with my friends.", "The internet is very weird. Funny to see you here, old friend.

With her family visiting so much do they feel it would be overwhelming for them to visit too or don\u2019t know what else is needed and aren\u2019t given answers. You have your feelings, they gave theirs now how do you move forward with better communication on both sides.", "I mean you are the one who married her in sickness and in health. You made those vows to her, not your family. People usually expect others to love someone as they love them. That is your wife, soulmate, one true love, or whatever you want to call her. They don\u2019t feel that way. A hospital is a frightening place for the people in it and maybe they view it as letting her have privacy to heal.", "Truthfully, I don't think you are TA. I can understand where you are coming from. (I do understand where they are coming from too so they aren't really TA either). \n\nWhether or not you respond to messages, should not be the driving factor IMO. You have a lot going on. It should not be your responsibility to not only help with your wife but tell members of your own family what they need to do.  My father had an accident in 2003 and asking my mom what she needed was the worst thing to do. You just had to show up for her. That is what she needed. (It's also better to ask what she needed face to face than over text or the phone).\n\nWith that being said, some people do not want to overstep and need  to be asked/told what to do. \n\nIt comes across as there was some hurt early on.. or perhaps they are not fans of your choice of partner in general? It's the way the texts are written. We love you son. We will support you, etc... It just comes across that way. \n\nI think at this point you are angry and upset and probably lashing out at them because they are the easiest to lash out at because again you have ALOT going on.", "Since covid in my country you aren't allowed visitors in hospital, even when giving birth the only other person allowed is the father no one else so I think it would be fair to assume that she wasn't allowed visitors apart from the husband", ">Or they could\u2019ve asked can she have visitors!! I am just saying it goes both ways. They want to put all the blame on a man that is watching his wife suffer and be extremely sick. If your son was keeping you updated on his wife wouldn\u2019t you ask if you could help?? \n\nYeah, this reminds me of something I read about how, after trauma or a death, it's not best to ask \"what can I do?\", because that requires the grieving person to spend time and emotional energy on YOU - whether you really want to help, what kind of tasks you could do, etc. \n\nInstead, it's better if you can think of something - whether it's spending time with them, doing their dishes, sending them DoorDash, whatever - and ask specifically if that would be welcome / helpful to them.", "You\u2019re 100% right. But according to his mother \u201cthat\u2019s on him\u201d. Imagine being angry at someone who is going through this", "Entertain? No, that's not why I've ever been there for my family, and not why I'd be there for my former DIL, son or granddaughter. Expecting to be entertained is messed up, but I think waiting for your overwhelmed son to call and tell you what he needs is messed up to.", "Yeah. And the thing is, it's not that hard to just ask *specifics*! 'Can I give you a break so you can have a shower'. 'Do you need any clothes brought from home'. Etc.

To do that to someone in the hospital is insane. I\u2019d 100% need them to back off and wait for me to reach out. People have different preferences and OP\u2019s family aren\u2019t mind readers.

Both BIL and sister work full time, and have children, one of which has special needs and may need a specific child care arrangement. He\u2019s clearly upset, but it\u2019s unrealistic for him to expect the same level of support from his sister with a young family of her own and his wife\u2019s retired parents.

OP\u2019s family is trying to figure out what OP wants but he\u2019s ignored them and so they have done the best they can. \n\nOP never asked, and didn\u2019t respond to his family asking how they can help. For all they know, he was going to blow up at them for reaching out more. They are not mind readers. It\u2019s up to OP to set out expectations and ask for what he needs, not ignore them then go off on them when they don\u2019t anticipate his needs and desires."]}
