She has Primary Progressive MS. Since 2020, we sold our house, moved into an accessible apt, she lost the ability to walk, so much.\n\nI've slept on a broken chair and floor so I can help (she has speech issues and I can translate - cant press call button). The UTI has brought on Blood in the urine, fluid in her lungs, etc, kept the fam updated in a group txt. 3 days ago I sent my mom + sis a text (edited for char#)\n\nWe've been here 3wks and none of you have even suggested visiting. Or anything other than words.\n\nEvery single member of [wife]'s family has been here more than once. Her mom and sis come here for hours to let me go home and rest. Friends of ours have sent GCs.

Would you suggest going to [sister] to help her for Christmas, or whatever?\n\n[BIL] is no less important to [Sister] than [wife] is to me.  Same with dad to mom. So why are we less important to you?\n\nMOM RESPONSE:\nWe are all so disappointed in you. Your family have been your biggest supporter through all these years and with everything you've done. We will always be there to support you no matter what. But today, I was so upset, angered and disappointed in your text. \n\nYour family let you know that we are here for you and if you needed anything we would do it in a minute for you and [wife]. But you never asked, and that's on you! We didn't even know that [wife] could have visitors.  I don't even know if we are allowed in the hospital. And that's on you! You should've let us know that she was allowed visitors and we could have set up a time in which we could visit her.  And that's on you!\n\nYou know that your family would be there in a minute to help you at home. I would've gone to your apartment and wrapped your presents, cleaned it for you and do laundry and set you up for when you come home. But, I have no way of getting into your apartment.  And that's on you! I feel as if you have distance yourself from your family. And that I find is very disappointing.\n\nI'm glad that [wife]'s parents and family go to visit her, as they should because that is her immediate family. \n\nI'm glad your friends do door Dash, etc. for you, but did you forget about the 6 months we paid for Hello Fresh?. We keep on asking you what you need and we don't get an answer, and that's on you! I'm disheartened at the way that you have spoken to us.\n\nWe value the time we have with you but it's mostly on your time. Just once I would like you to call us up and schedule a time for a visit. You have deeply upset us all today with your words, which we will never forget. And that's on you! I don't want an answer from this text unless it's an apology.\n\u2010\nSo is it me?

You\u2019re probably lacking sleep and are scared so emotions are high. Call and let them know you need help.", "Sister response:\n\n I'm really sorry you're feeling embarrassed of us.  I know that what you are going through is super tough.  I have in our previous conversation asked you if there was anything I can do for you.  You never responded. \n\nAt no point did you mention that we could visit or that [wife] was up for visitors as previous times we've or the kids have visited , [wife] was always sleeping and had to visit in the foyer which we happily obliged. \n\nI know you're in need of a big hug and I'm sorry i can't be there for you to give you one. It's extremely difficult for me to see you between work and kids. I'm glad that her family can see you and her as her parents are retired and have chance to be there.  I unfortunately, with the work we are in do not that have that option. As well seeing that I get most of the information about how she is doing is through Instagram I really didn't think she was taking visitors also because of the amount you've said you sleep during the day. \n\nAs for her mom and sister visiting for hours, do you think she wants me to be there for hours?  please remember I do not have child care for [son with Downs syndrome] as hubbu works, so for hours is impossible. \n\nNow with that being said I'm not making excuses, you've also never reached out asking for help. And on the group texts you never mentioned visitors are welcome. \n\nAs for saying or feeling that she is less important is something you've placed in your thoughts, we've never felt that way. \n\nAs for saying I don't value our time is something again you have decided to make yourself believe. Never have words like that be said to you.  \n\nAs far as door dash, she as we see on Instagram can't eat so...\n\nyou're hurting I get it but I'm not a punching bag for you to take it out on.

I imagine it\u2019s very tiring and very emotionally hard. \n\nIn the texts that your posting, your family seems like they\u2019re nothing but supportive. They\u2019ve made it clear you haven\u2019t asked. \n\nThere\u2019s a privacy thing to be mindful of. I have an extremely close relationship with my in-laws. But if one of them was hospitalized,  I wouldn\u2019t just show up out of respect for their privacy and rest. I would want to be told that I\u2019m allowed to be there. \n\nIm sorry, but YTA here. Your family is supportive. They\u2019re asking you how they can support you, and you\u2019re stomping your feet because they can\u2019t read your mind.", "I came here fully to give a N.T.A but no this is on you. They aren\u2019t mind-readers. \n\nYTA for not communicating with them or asking for help and then putting it all on them. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this but don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be. Tell them what you need!", "I, uh, hrm. ESH I guess?\n\nLook, you're exhausted, physically *and* emotionally. Try to put this aside and focus on your wife. Sometimes it's easier to be angry than to be sad, and if that's what is going on, consider a punching bag or something. Anything that helps you cope right now is worthwhile. \n\nWhile you're not entitled to anyone's time, your mom's behavior isn't great either. I can't imagine knowing that my daughter-in-law was suffering from sepsis and progressive MS, that my son had the overwhelming job of being her primary caretaker, and then I offer my help once and sit back and don't worry about it again. I also can't imagine sending this email to anyone--much less my child--who was in the hospital with a family member. She's literally telling you \"It's your fault!\" on repeat, with a quick side of \"You didn't even thank us for Hellofresh!\" She may not owe you more, but it's not thoughtful, it's not kind, and it's not considerate, and I guess we would all like our moms to have those qualities.\n\nPlease join a zoom group for caregivers if you don't already have one. I took care of my late husband for just over a year and I nearly drowned in it. Talking to other people who understand can help.", "YTA. A lot of hospitals are not allowing visitors still do to covid. It's totally understandable that they didn't know they were allowed to visit.", "YTA. They\u2019re not obliged to visit and, as was pointed out, they didn\u2019t know if you wanted them there or if they were allowed to come.\n\nWould I visit my family in hospital? Definitely. However, you\u2019ve approached your wife\u2019s situation in the wrong way.", "Soft YTA it sounds like you\u2019re emotionally fried and in a very tough spot. However, you need to properly communicate with your family as it sounds like they would be more than happy to help but haven\u2019t felt welcome enough to do so.", "ESH.  It seems like you reached out in your frustration with the lack of support from your family, and your mom's response was less than helpful.  It really seems like she twisted things around there.  I don't think it's fair to blame you for all of it.  I can understand them not realizing they could visit, etc., but have they called you to check in and see how you are doing?   I also think they should have had more grace with you, knowing that you are likely emotionally distressed right now, rather than trying to blame you.  In the future, saying something like, \"Hey, I could use some support here.  Can you come visit?\", would get you farther along.", "YTA. I\u2019m really hesitant with this answer, but your moms right. Your family sounds like they are willing to help, but some people need to be asked or told what you need, that\u2019s no fault on them, no one can read minds.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for everything you\u2019re going through, that\u2019s truly awful and I wish the best for both you and your wife. My best advice right now is to apologize for lashing out and be honest about the help that you need. Sounds like they would visit in a heartbeat, so tell them that. That you need their help and support right now and it would mean a lot to you and your wife if they were able to visit her in the hospital. With everything after COVID, it\u2019s understandable that they weren\u2019t sure if they were able to come visit. Some hospitals have a limited amount of visitors per day, and if your mom thought that the hospital had that, then she probably didn\u2019t want to take the opportunity away from your in laws to be able to visit.", "YTA\n\nNo one owes you the support you are looking for.  The way you \"called them out\" reeks of entitlement and judgment.  Your family are absolutely right to be angry at your message.  \n\nIf you want help, SPEAK UP!  People can't read your mind!", "Gentle YTA bud. I can only imagine how terrifying and hard this is. But for a lot of people, illness, especially a severe illness like your wife has, and being in the hospital is INTIMATE. It\u2019s a vulnerable time where your loved one is stuck in bed, unable to care for themselves, and suffering. It can be scary for family members to dive into that, especially for an in-law. It sounds like your family doesn\u2019t want to overstep, invade you and your wife\u2019s privacy, or overwhelm you in a time that you\u2019re already overwhelmed. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019ve expressed to you that they will do anything you ask. And they need some prompting. By telling you \u201clet us know how we can help\u201d, the ball was put in your court. It isn\u2019t fair to think they can read your mind and know what you need. For your wife\u2019s family to visit is a bit more socially norm. It\u2019s their sister & daughter. Your family loves her too, but they likely don\u2019t feel as natural - and it isn\u2019t as socially normalized - for them to rush to her bedside in the hospital. \n\nYou need to extend an olive branch, apologize, and ask if they can come by the hospital to visit and maybe discuss some ways they can help you out at home while you\u2019re tending to your wife in the hospital. Otherwise you risk losing what looks to be a very strong part of your support system for good.", "I don't understand these Y-T-A votes at all. Your mother's response was very judgmental and angry. In your exhaustion and grief, did you perhaps take out your frustration on your family? Its possible - but its also understandable. If one of my kids reached out to me to express feeling alone & abandoned by me, I sure as heck wouldn't respond with \"well, that's on you!\" \n\nCould you have responded to there \"hey, let us know what you need\" texts? Sure, but you have a lot on your plate. Your family could have been specific - \"can we visit? good, when? can we come over and clean? can we bring you food? are you getting any rest?\" etc. Specific items that you could respond to. That's how family supports each other. \n\nNTA. \n\nLastly, I'm so sorry about your wife. I hope she is feeling better soon.

I was in a similar situation with my husband developing a chronic, debilitating illness. His OWN family did almost nothing to assist us unless it was what they wanted to do, which was take the kids. I needed help with watching him sometimes so I could run to the grocery store, take the kids to birthday parties or sports. He couldn\u2019t be left alone. They always had an excuse.  \n\nI generally agree with others who say people don\u2019t know what to do to help unless you tell them.

His family, nothing. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a caregiver, your family knows you\u2019re struggling. You\u2019re stressed, overwhelmed, and desperate.

You are spending every second with your wife, caring for her and ensuring she gets the medical care she needs. The least they can do is reach out and not ignore you like everything's fine.

Who cares if they can do dishes and help you in many ways if they can be so brutal with words? They could have been more diplomatic and kinder, saying sorry for the misunderstanding, we did not know what was happening, make sure next time to tell us if you need us.", "Yes you are being gaslighted by your awful mom and family. Cut contact and be with the people that care for you. UTI's are awful and hope your wife gets better soon. NTA", "I'm going to have to go with NAH. It sounds like your mom is a little resentful because she's done some things for you and hasn't felt like it's been reciprocated, and I do understand your view point. Part of helping people is taking on their mental load, so they should be able to assume what needs done. My parents 100% would show up to the hospital and stay for a while, and when leaving they'd take my key and we'd later be going home to a clean house with a full fridge and their company if needed/wanted. \n\nTo me, it sounds like you need to apologize for not tending to your mother's needs in the past and reiterate you'll try your best to be more considerate of them in the future, and also clarify with her that what you need right now is to feel cared for by having someone step in and start making some low-level decisions on your behalf because you're stressed and exhausted. Don't compare halves of the family. Just state what you need. Both sides have unmet needs, and while yours seem much more urgent and severe, she's a human being and needs to receive in addition to giving. It sounds like you're having long term problems with your wife, and while you agreed to in sickness and in health, your family did not, so there's only so much you can expect her to do without feeling appreciated (and it sounds like she'd feel appreciated not by thank yous, but by visits).\n\nThe biggest thing that caused me to go with NAH instead of NTA is your mother saying she's asked multiple times what you need and you've not said anything. If you want things and people are asking, you do need to tell them. If she's not actually asking, it unfortunately sounds like you may need to ask", "NTA - a huge part of being a helpful and supportive family member is taking some of the emotional burden off their loved ones. That includes them doing the mental work of offering helpful suggestions for what they can do within their means/lives. If they actually wanted to be helpful they would check in and offer actual tangible help, like seeing if you had eaten and bringing/ordering food for you, offering to bring you clean clothes, or how long they could stay at what specific time so you could run home to shower & take care of yourself.

I hope you are both doing well. Focus on your wife and your family and friends that support you.", "Oh OP, I don't have a call to make here, because I've been on multiple sides of this and it's just the worst. I hope your wife recovers as much as is possible and you both have some quality time left together.\n\nIt seems like there's a bit of a communication style mismatch here, and some amount of your family not knowing what to do/not wanting to overstep so only doing things if specifically asked. \n\nBeing a primary caretaker is so difficult and when I've been that person it's hard AF to figure out what you need, who to ask for it, and coordinate that support. It sounds like your family may not have experienced caring for anyone in this type of situation, and so can't even make educated guesses, which makes it even more difficult.\n\nI'd make a list of the types of support you've received, and the types you haven't that might be helpful, and then give that to your family. Include your own needs- you still need to eat and sleep and do other tasks, or even just take breaks. If this feels too overwhelming, ask a close friend or your wife's family to do this on your behalf. Also, if you want them to provide support without needing to reach out and ask each time, maybe make it so they do some recurring supportive action. Maybe that's them taking you to lunch/sending food in whatever form on a specific day each week. The whole offer vs. wait to be asked thing is difficult.\n\nAlso, what your sister said - about having her own caregiving work that limits her availability - may mean that she's provided the help she can but while she loves and cares for you, doesn't have the time/money to do more. I'd treat her separately from your parents, and try and accept that this may be the best she can do. \n\nI don't think you're entirely wrong to feel as you do, or at least I have felt the same way at points when I was in a similar situation. \n\nDo you have a caregiver support group and/or your own therapist?

I can also understand their side too as if I'm in the hospital, no one on my husband's side would be expected to show up. It's a courtesy thing for us. Be transparent and tell them what you are wanting so they can help. You can be upset, but I think you are reading way too deep into this. I take care of my disabled child and if I need help, I ask. If I need a ten minute break, I ask. If I want a hug, I'll ask, ect. People aren't mind readers. It is clear that you are not in the best frame of mind right now, and that is okay.

And while it would be one thing if they just said \"I'm sorry we haven't been there for you in the way you need\" and then made an offer or a suggestion, they've added a lot of guilting and blame where it's not helpful or needed.\n\nWhen my dad was dying, I reached out to an old friend to talk, for support. She ended up blowing off that conversation. I sent her a long message sort of like yours, and she: apologized, said she appreciated being told how I felt, promised not to do anything like that again if I would allow her to still be part of my support system, talked with me regularly (including the day after he died), and sent me a care package totally unbidden. Not a word about what I should have done differently, note. Other friends did so much for me in that time, or later on when I was bedridden after COVID. None of them put it on me to figure out what to ask for like your family is (they either just did it or they made specific offers/suggestions), or guilted me for needing support or having some difficult emotions. So while I think everybody could have communicated better here, and people don't always know what to do and so they freeze...

The only one who didn't donate money. \n\nI do think a lot of the emotion is where you're coming from. Not looking for a scapegoat per se, but finding something that makes me angry and having it amplified by my exhaustion which doesnt help either, but I was hoping that even if it came across that way they'd be able to see it all over me and recognize it.\n\nCaregivers go through so much without being able to pop our heads up to ask for help. We're too in the weeds and get lost in it. I'm sorry you were in that position at all - its the worst feeling.

Or to use her sickness to guilt them.\n\nYTA.", "My family?  No.  I've been in the hospital for over a week and none of them showed up.

But I do hope this helps you reprioritize taking care of yourself (you can't care for her if you're totally burnt out!) and learning how to identify and communicate your needs. Too often men are taught to be stoic and independent and not to reach out for help, but you will be very strong if you can figure out how to do so.", "Dude , sorry about your wife. But your sister has a Down\u2019s syndrome baby. How many times have you and your wife offered to help her in the past ? No wonder she is pissed.", "I've also got chronic illnesses and ive been in the hospital many times for days or weeks on end, as well as on the caregiver side.\n\nYou want, and need, so badly to get that support from these people who you think should, and you want/need it in the least stressful and most helpful way. But just like everything else in life, even getting support isnt as straightforward and easy as we'd like.\n\nWhat your mother responded with seemed more aggressive than anyone should have. But seeing your sister's reply, too, makes me think they really dont know what you want and need. I've had similar exhanges when Ive been burnt out, and desperately upset with a lack of support. You don't need extra drama right now, it will only make things harder, but you also need support. So, get what you need from this thread, I'd highly suggest not wasting time trying to convince a bunch of Y-T-As why youre right though, and focus on your optioms and what youre going to do going forward.\n\nYou can just ignore them all and focus on your in laws and friends support, or from a support group (ask the hospital, they have resources for people exactly in your position). This is not an invalid option, anything else might be too much for you, thats okay.\n\nYou can focus your energy on just getting to a good spot with your sister (she seems the more understanding of the 2). Or you can try both your sister and your mom, or the whole group chat.\n\nI completely get the not knowing what to ask for. And I also get from their side, not knowing what to offer. You can, or you can ask them to, google (i use pinterest actually), \"how to help someone who's in the hospital long term\" \"what do i do for someone who's a burned out caregiver\", or im sure theres probably a sub here even. Someone mentiomed getting you a coffee or lunch. Explain to your sister doordash would be for you, as youre so exhausted.\n\nI know at this point you feel like you cant/shouldnt have to put effort in to get them to help. But I think you should try. Feel your feelings, then do what you need to get support for yourself.", "It is hard being a care giver. Unless you experience it, you don't know the stress and exhaustion it causes.

I have a chronic condition not MS and had 2 UTI's last month so I know the pain. Pray she gets better soon and is out of the hospital. \nIn my family as soon as we know someone is in hospital we down tools and make sure if not all then one of us can be there, we don't wait to be asked to come or offer help, that's why I'm a bit shocked with all the YTA responses. You are doing right but forget this now, deal with it when your wife is better and home and you have time to think things through. Good luck.", "I'm just talking about what she's bringing up from the past, like not visiting her. I'm not contending you need to fulfill her needs right now at all, because that would be a selfish ask of her, but if your wife is having long-term health complications, there's a chance you're always expecting your needs to be put first and she's becoming resentful because that's hard on anybody (as you may be experiencing with putting your wife first - you absolutely love her, but it's not an inherently easy task, so props to you). As I said, you committed to this, not them, so you do need to reciprocate from time to time and it sounds like she doesn't feel like you're doing that, that's all. I'm also very sorry you're in this situation.", "You are willfully missing the point. Your mom is talking about how you ignored her when you and your wife were not ill.", "I think you might have to accept that your family aren\u2019t the type to proactively offer help even though you\u2019ve told them that\u2019s exactly what you need.

I think this stems not only from my exhaustion but her and I have been living through this for 3 years now (context I couldn't fit in the original post because I originally had it at 7000 characters) and the amount of help I've asked for has dwindled because I didn't fit their schedules and live 20 minutes away. I've slowly asked less and less because they helped less and less and this message was kind of a last gasp of \"wtf\" brought on by the exhaustion.", "How much help are you providing your sister with her special needs child?", "It sounds like your wife's family and your friends are keepers. \n\nSometimes in life we have to accept that what we see is what we get with our families and either accept it for what it is (absent other toxicity of course) or pull away, or a little of both. \n\nYour energy is spent right now. You need people around you that build you up. That's not your family. Put a pin in this to deal with later.

Please take care of yourself.", "Ok, so a past pattern has made home as resentment in you. Thats absolutely human. Your feelings are valid! 3 years??? Thats a long time. You and your wife must be literally at your wits end. If its hard to ask, it seems your sister has a gokd head on her shoulders, and Genuinley wants to help! \n\nNo shame in asking for help, in asking for help. \n\nBare with me; maybe sister can help by being a middle person for you and the family. Maybe you can give sis a solid  weekly schedule of time chunks you KNOW you need help with. See if sis is willing to help coordinate while you care for wife. Like, you give sis a 2 week calendar. And while your pulling shifts, sis can talk to Mom or other sibling, etc. Try to coordinate on your behalf. IF sis is willing to do so ofcourse. \n\nIf not, open the discussion. Talk it out with them. And be honest. Theirs nothing worse than feelings that come when you feel you cant just, say it all. \n\nI understand why you snapped. But it also seems your willing to gain perspective, means your a good person who means well. Your just literally being pushed to the limit and your wearing thin. Let your sis help you out.

I know how exhausting that was emotionally and physically, so I can only imagine what it feels like for you. \n\nThat said, it seems like a lot of this conflict has been created in your head and it is unfair to ask questions like \"would they have come if I had said they could\". You'll never know the real answer to that so I would suggest you take what they said in good faith. Anything else will drive you crazy and just create more resentment. A lot of people truly don't know how to help in these situations and it's not fair to expect them to. I know it's hard to ask for specifics when your mental bandwidth is at its limits, but start small and see how they respond.\n\nIt sounds like you and your wife, but especially you are going to need all the support you can get as this progresses and I would hate for this resentment you've built up to limit what support you do have. Just meet them halfway and see where things go.", "Unless I\u2019m misinterpreting something, it looks like your family has asked you what they can do with no response from you. Did you ever tell them that you\u2019d like them to visit?

If my Sons-in-law were in the hospital, I might go to visit once or twice for 15-20 minutes, but really, that's about it.  \n\nDo you really want your family over there constantly?  Does she?  I bet she doesn't.  I know I'd appreciate a brief visit from my iin-laws, but I'd appreciate peace and quiet even more.  \n\nI think  you're getting push-back because YOU unfairly pushed.  Just tell them what you want and need.   Some people don't want to push boundaries and be a nuisance.  They treat people the way they'd like to be treated, unless told differently.  If you need help, ask for it.  If you'd like help or support, let them know.\n\nOf course, accusing them of neglecting you and not caring about you was a bad way to start.   Frankly, I think the first apology should be yours.", "I think the issue here is you and your family are looking at things from two different perspectives.\n\nYour family is looking at what them visiting would do for your wife, a woman they may love but is not their child. Would your wife want to be surrounded by her in-laws in the same way she would by her parents?\n\nYou are looking at what visiting/helping will do for you. You need help right now. Your need your loved ones to support you mentally and physically. If your emotional and mental state could be displayed physically you would likely also be in a hospital bed.\n\nYour family doesn\u2019t want to intrude on you and your wife\u2019s time with her, and that\u2019s interfering with how they are reaching out to you. \n\nContinue to be honest  and direct with them about your needs.

I understand that they felt attacked and disrespected by your comments, but hopefully they understand the immense strain you\u2019re under. The mental load of caregiving is enormous. Take a deep breath and reach back out when you\u2019re calm. Tell them what you need and that you apologize for taking your pain out on them.

Hugs from afar.", "One thing to keep in mind. \n\nWhen drowning, the life boat provides more safety than the shore. \n\nI am so sorry for what you are going through. It really sucks that your family has let you down.

There are many instances of moments I've had with them leading into this that really spun me in this direction. Hard to add years of context in 3000 characters but when all this was done and I replied to my mother's message, I honestly felt more relieved than upset which I think speaks volumes of where we were at before i sent the message. Which is why it's hard to find the good faith aspect of their texts.\n\nBut I will take your advice once I know where this is going and we get out of here, to see if that avenue is still open or completely flooded over.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry you've been through a similar situation by any means. It's horrible, and I don't wish it on anyone.", "I have, yes. It just isnt a fast response because im dealing with whatever doctors, nurses, and aids require in translation for her speech.

Why can't one of them be bothered to call him? He's busy carrying for his wife on little to know sleep, but should do all of that to call them? WTF.

They want to put all the blame on a man that is watching his wife suffer and be extremely sick. If your son was keeping you updated on his wife wouldn\u2019t you ask if you could help?? Wouldn\u2019t you ask if she was up to visits ?? Wouldn\u2019t you ask if he needed a break to take a walk get some coffee. It does not always have to be up to him.
