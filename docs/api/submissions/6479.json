My sister drank and smoked during her pregnancy which caused my poor nephew to be born with a lot of mental and physical health issues. The most prominent is the fact that he's autistic and spoiled. They treat him like a king and that he can't do any wrong. I don't think they know of any other way to take care of a child.\n\nHe's bratty, he doesn't know to properly show his emotions, he expects everything done for him, if the slightest piece of food is made in a way he doesn't enjoy he throws a tantrum, if the space he's in doesn't smell perfect he'll start screaming.\n\nNow, yesterday they announced that they're going on a vacation and they need me to take care of him at a family gathering. I laughed and said that was funny, then they turned to me and said they are serious. I told them that if they are that's a completely ridiculous request as they are providing me with exactly 72 hours of notice without even checking in with me. This weekend I finally got a break from my work at a private highschool so I was planning on relaxing with my husband. I told her and her husband that they should actually take care of their child instead of trying to place responsibility elsewhere for once and actually step up as parents.\n\nMy sister got extremely offended and her husband backed her up.\n\nMy family split into two, with me and my mother arguing it's crazy to do this to someone and essentially the rest of the family siding with my sister. They're saying that since I have this weekend free I should use it do something productive instead of lazing around and take care of my nephew. This spiralled into a 4 hour long argument about how ungrateful I was for refusing this \"special time\" with my nephew that a lot of uncles don't get. I still refused because this is an outrageous request of me.\n\nYesterday I started receiving a lot of text messages saying that I'm a AH for not being there for my nephew when he needs me the most. This translates into \"we can't afford this vacation so a nanny is out of the question and we need someone to take care of him for free\". \n\nI blocked them all except for my mother on social medias, their numbers, messages, etc. \n\nMy sister came by and screamed at my door for thirty minutes when I wasn't opening and ranted about how awful a person I am even though she's always there for me.

The poor kid doesn't stand a chance with his parents.", "Or take their son with them on vacation... most parents do that.", "OP is clearly so completely clueless about autism it might well be that they actually do have systems and plans in place but that OP sees these as 'spoiling' him.", "Im sorry but all those people siding with OPs sister why can't they help. Alot of people calling OP the AH seem to just want their free time should we make sure everyone is not \"lazing\" around?", "That\u2019s very true. They don\u2019t give any examples of what it looks like when they \u201cgive in\u201d.", "It\u2019s not \u201ccatering,\u201d it\u2019s accommodation of a disability. Would you tell the parents of a kid who is paralyzed from the waist down that they are \u201ccatering because it\u2019s easier in the short term, instead of doing the hard work toward their child being able to navigate life\u201d by allowing the child to use a wheelchair and assisting them with using the restroom?", "~~To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about OP when it comes to asshole status.~~\n\nOn one hand, they clearly have a fundamental misunderstanding and lack of education when it comes to autism, but misinformation and disinformation are EVERYWHERE.\n\nOn the other hand, it wouldn't have taken much for OP to do some research and talk to some real autistic people to get a better understanding. ~~They seem willing to learn, but they haven't really taken much initiative.~~\n\nThe parents are clearly assholes because that's their job and the bare minimum. ~~I guess I would say OP is also the asshole for their ableism (however unintentional), but they can redeem themselves if they take the right steps.~~ I agree with ESH.\n\nEDIT: Crossed out some things because I just found out the kid is 14, and OP has never put in any effort to learn anything about autism. Definitely ESH.", "Yeah. My issue and where I start to think op is an asshole is the fact that the kid is 14 and in 14 years they haven\u2019t even done a basic google search about autism. If they did they would at least know it\u2019s not caused by drinking/smoking. I get not knowing, but that\u2019s usually only acceptable with people who have had no experiences with anyone who is autistic. OP automatically jumped to the kid is spoiled and just stuck with that for 14 years.", "I actually totally missed where OP said the kid is 14. Not that it would excuse anything if the kid was younger. It's still plenty of time to put in some effort to learn something about it.", "Yeah. \ud83d\ude05 That detail was kinda the nail in the coffin for me.", "I can't believe OP didn't put that in the original post. That makes them an asshole 100%. Practically a decade and a half, and they just chose not to even lift a finger to educate themselves.\n\nIt's absolutely wild. I edited my previous comment because that makes OP a pretty big asshole in my book. It's one thing to be ignorant, but OP has been willfully so for 14 years."]}
