My sister drank and smoked during her pregnancy which caused my poor nephew to be born with a lot of mental and physical health issues. The most prominent is the fact that he's autistic and spoiled. They treat him like a king and that he can't do any wrong. I don't think they know of any other way to take care of a child.\n\nHe's bratty, he doesn't know to properly show his emotions, he expects everything done for him, if the slightest piece of food is made in a way he doesn't enjoy he throws a tantrum, if the space he's in doesn't smell perfect he'll start screaming.\n\nNow, yesterday they announced that they're going on a vacation and they need me to take care of him at a family gathering. I laughed and said that was funny, then they turned to me and said they are serious. I told them that if they are that's a completely ridiculous request as they are providing me with exactly 72 hours of notice without even checking in with me. This weekend I finally got a break from my work at a private highschool so I was planning on relaxing with my husband. I told her and her husband that they should actually take care of their child instead of trying to place responsibility elsewhere for once and actually step up as parents.\n\nMy sister got extremely offended and her husband backed her up.\n\nMy family split into two, with me and my mother arguing it's crazy to do this to someone and essentially the rest of the family siding with my sister. They're saying that since I have this weekend free I should use it do something productive instead of lazing around and take care of my nephew. This spiralled into a 4 hour long argument about how ungrateful I was for refusing this \"special time\" with my nephew that a lot of uncles don't get. I still refused because this is an outrageous request of me.\n\nYesterday I started receiving a lot of text messages saying that I'm a AH for not being there for my nephew when he needs me the most. This translates into \"we can't afford this vacation so a nanny is out of the question and we need someone to take care of him for free\". \n\nI blocked them all except for my mother on social medias, their numbers, messages, etc. \n\nMy sister came by and screamed at my door for thirty minutes when I wasn't opening and ranted about how awful a person I am even though she's always there for me. Mind you she was a bully to me during our entire childhood and now she's unreliable at best when I need help.\n\nAITA for not taking care of my nephew?

But I'd need someone more knowledgeable to add more onto this.", "That\u2019s cool, sorry you have to deal with such entitled family members.", "At this point, it's thought that [autism is probably caused by genetics](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928), although there are some environmental factors that are still being studied.", "Well you\u2019re completely outmatched but either way you get to eat delicious food so it\u2019s a clear win", "Yeah, he probably needs a whole lot more support than his crappy parents give him. \ud83d\ude1e", "Not your child.  Simple as that.  And it is NOT wrong to say \"I don't really like to be around him.\"  We all have someone in our life that we'd rather not be around.", "The parents seem like absolute trash, I get that. It just also seems like the kid is going to need a lot of grace extended their way for a long time to come", "Then maybe the reason why your family is upset with you is not exclusively about this weekend, but more generally about your overall attitude toward your nephew and your sister's family? \n\nAgain, you're NTA about wanting to spend this weekend without him. But if after 14 years, you still haven't tried to understand your nephew's condition and instead have it wrapped up with your feelings toward your sister, then I could see how that would be frustrating to your family.", "You're nta to your sister but definitely ta to your nephew. Get educated about the spectrum, and try and help your family get educated, too. You're punishing your nephew because of the way his mother treated you.

Since there are a lot of issues that can appear, physical and also mental and behaviour related stuff.\n\nFAS is really no joke and for some it's really hard, not to forget the stigma to the family, especially the moher. Because, and yes, that is a fact, you don't have to drink often during a pregnancy to harm your child, once is enough, if the timing is \"right\".\n\nI'd advise to just not drink alcohol during pregnancy.", "I don't point it out to anyone. I tend to keep my feelings to myself so I didn't ever say anything about this and I gladly cared for my nephew when I had warning. However nobody else in my family ever wants to care for my nephew so I don't think it's caused by this. I'm the kindest one to him , mainly due to the fact that my sister and her husband treat him like a king and my father completely ignores his existence.", "Not spending time with someone because their parents are toxic to you is not punishing them. It's self preservation which is important.", "Poor kid.", "He's stuck in the middle of it, that's a big reason why I posted this because I still want my nephew to feel like he's loved and cared for and not alone while his parents take off to Italy.", "Holy cow, this wasn't just a getaway to Vegas for the weekend -- they're planning an international trip and didn't think to ask someone to watch their kid? Wow, that's some next-level entitlement there."]}
