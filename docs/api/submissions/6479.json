My sister drank and smoked during her pregnancy which caused my poor nephew to be born with a lot of mental and physical health issues. The most prominent is the fact that he's autistic and spoiled. They treat him like a king and that he can't do any wrong. I don't think they know of any other way to take care of a child.\n\nHe's bratty, he doesn't know to properly show his emotions, he expects everything done for him, if the slightest piece of food is made in a way he doesn't enjoy he throws a tantrum, if the space he's in doesn't smell perfect he'll start screaming.\n\nNow, yesterday they announced that they're going on a vacation and they need me to take care of him at a family gathering. I laughed and said that was funny, then they turned to me and said they are serious. I told them that if they are that's a completely ridiculous request as they are providing me with exactly 72 hours of notice without even checking in with me. This weekend I finally got a break from my work at a private highschool so I was planning on relaxing with my husband. I told her and her husband that they should actually take care of their child instead of trying to place responsibility elsewhere for once and actually step up as parents.\n\nMy sister got extremely offended and her husband backed her up.\n\nMy family split into two, with me and my mother arguing it's crazy to do this to someone and essentially the rest of the family siding with my sister. They're saying that since I have this weekend free I should use it do something productive instead of lazing around and take care of my nephew. This spiralled into a 4 hour long argument about how ungrateful I was for refusing this \"special time\" with my nephew that a lot of uncles don't get. I still refused because this is an outrageous request of me.\n\nYesterday I started receiving a lot of text messages saying that I'm a AH for not being there for my nephew when he needs me the most. This translates into \"we can't afford this vacation so a nanny is out of the question and we need someone to take care of him for free\". \n\nI blocked them all except for my mother on social medias, their numbers, messages, etc. \n\nMy sister came by and screamed at my door for thirty minutes when I wasn't opening and ranted about how awful a person I am even though she's always there for me. Mind you she was a bully to me during our entire childhood and now she's unreliable at best when I need help.\n\nAITA for not taking care of my nephew? I feel so guilty leaving him when his parents are awful people.\n\nEdit: Thank you to all the people who are helping me understand more about autism and FAS and how they are different things. I'll try to be there for my nephew more and learn about his conditions so I can accommodate for him. Thank you so much everybody, I really hope I can make a difference for my nephew.", "created_utc": 1672849645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1037t1k/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my_nephew/", "score": 1413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We experience things that strongly! \n\nI\u2019m not saying that his parents don\u2019t spoil him.

(Amazon & PetCo sell them!)", "\"behave in society\" lol what a horrible phrase.\n\nAlso tantrums and meltdowns may look similar but are not the same thing. Meltdowns are not voluntary because someone is spoilt. I used to get punished for \"tantrums\" all the time as a child until my parent realised that if they took away the unnecessarily bright lights and didn't try to force me to wear the jumper with the extra-scratchy tag or make me use the slimy soap I was suddenly perfectly fine and \"well-behaved\". Your perception of autistic coping skills is based on how well they conform to being socially acceptable, which for autistic people basically translates to \"how well can I avoid the thing I find super overwhelming\" and \"how well can I mask my needs and behaviours so assholes don't get weird towards me\". You focus on the \"disruption\" that autistic people might cause and not the genuine distress they might be in. Is learning how to avoid having meltdowns useful? Yes! Because meltdowns suck, frankly, and people don't understand them. Learning to avoid them can mean avoiding certain situations or triggering factors, sticking to a rigid routine, and performing certain stim actions, regardless of other people's perceptions of how arbitrarily socially acceptable they are being.\n\nI encourage you to have a look at what being autistic is actually like for people because you frame everything in terms of how well autistic people can conform to the expectations of polite society. Yes, it's demeaning to have low expectations of autistic people based on their neurotype. It's also not reasonable to expect them to simply un-learn their autism. Being autistic is a fundamental difference in brain structure and development. Your neurological system is your entire self.
