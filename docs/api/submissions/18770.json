My mom got me some nice white towels for Christmas last year along with some other nice bathroom stuff I had asked for that would be out of my price range to buy on my own. \n\nAnyway, when the toilet ended up flooding after my husband used it, he freaked out on what to do and I told him to just throw one of our old cheap towels down since we don\u2019t use them anymore. He got mad at me for insinuating that one towel was nicer than another and said he knew I\u2019d care more about the towel than the situation at hand. This has happened one other time before, and the time before I also asked him not to use the nice towel and he got mad at me then as well for it. \n\nWell, he ended up using my nice towel instead of the other one because he didn\u2019t want to go to the closet and look for one of the old ones. I was upset and felt kind of disrespected considering I don\u2019t really get to own nice things and it feels like any nice things I do own are treated like this by my husband to begin with, and it caused a fight that I thought had blown over by tonight. \n\nThis background brings me to the issue I\u2019m now having. I asked if he minded if I changed where our cats are fed tonight because we haven\u2019t gotten a chance to go to the store to get some swiffer pads to swiffer that bathroom yet, and the cats have been fed on the tile in there opposed to the carpet in the rest of the house. I just wanted to feed them on the carpet and deal with potential mess later, as to me it feels gross to feed them on a floor I won\u2019t even step on barefoot because it hasn\u2019t been cleaned. He originally says that\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s putting something down on the carpet to eliminate any chance at a mess later. \n\nHe wanted to put down the towel he used last night to clean up the toilet water. The towel I didn\u2019t know he just threw on our carpeted closet floor after soaking up the water. The nasty towel that has been marinating in toilet water for  a day now is what he wanted to set down and feed our cats on. I try not to disagree with him much because he says I\u2019m instigating fights if I do, but I felt I had to speak up at how nasty this was. \n\nI asked him if he really thought it was okay to feed our cats off this towel that hasn\u2019t been washed and to please use a blanket or literally anything else. He called me controlling and said I was dictating how he feeds the cats and instigating a fight on what\u2019s been an otherwise good night to him. I ended up having to leave to cool off to stop being yelled at for saying I thought it was gross but can\u2019t help how icky and messed up this entire situation feels. He has me feeling like I\u2019ve genuinely done something wrong for asking he doesn\u2019t use this towel to feed our cats and refuses to speak to me now.

It\u2019s not like there is a rule against towelism where it\u2019s illegal to use older towels to clean up grosser stuff so you can throw it away. While he was right to put something under the cats while they eat so they don\u2019t mess up the carpet, it\u2019s so gross to use a toilet towel for that.

It sounds like your husband has some issues with doing anything with a hint of common sense if you were the one to offer the suggestion.

Just yikes.", "Your husband is petty & belittles you, & he calls you controlling if you speak up for yourself even a little as a way of deflecting your valid concerns off him and onto you so you don't question him. Nothing you asked for is actually controlling and it's perfectly reasonable to want to own nice things and to treat them better than not nice things\n\nNTA, but do yourself a favor and ask someone you can trust about some of this behavior and what they think of your husband", "NTA\n Your husband sounds controlling and completely immature. If he doesn't get why your requests make sense it's probably because he hadn't had to work hard enough to clean your shared house/property. I hope you don't have kids together yet, because he's not responsible enough yet. Seriously, very immature thinking he has, which he then tries to turn around on you. Why would you put up with any of that? You should probably be disagreeing with him more", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t insinuate that one towel was nicer than another.  You said that it was, because\u2026it is.\n\nIn my household, we definitely have different categories of towels.  Ratty/mismatched towels for the dog or cleaning big spills, the kitchen towels, my husband\u2019s preferred flat weave Turkish towels, the regular bathing towels, and the nice grey set for guests.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why your husband is refusing to treat your special luxury towels as special.  Even if it makes no difference to him, it\u2019s clearly important to you.  Using your special towels to clean up a sewage leak would be thoughtless if you hadn\u2019t said anything.  Since you did say something, it becomes more than that - it\u2019s deliberate disregard for your possessions.\n\nThen taking a nasty toilet leak towel and putting it down on the carpet\u2026that by itself is gross.  Having the cats eat off it is double gross.  You don)t want them walking on the toilet water and spreading it around your house.\n\nYour husband just comes off as mean, lazy, and selfish.", "Oh. Oh my.

It sounds like he\u2019s not very good at admitting when he\u2019s wrong and prefers to manipulate the situation to sound like it\u2019s your fault for being upset.\n\nLeaving a dirty toilet water towel in a cupboard?

Because to me it seems like you are both pretty nasty, but maybe your husband's grossness has just lowered your own bar.\n\nLike, why the hell do you feed your cats in the bathroom instead of in your kitchen? Why do you think a Swiffer pad is enough to clean a shit contaminated bathroom floor?

My children know how to turn off the water supply to the toilet before disaster strikes. Also, who gets white towels? That is just so weird to me. The last thing someone wants to do when there\u2019s an emergency is search for the \u201ccorrect\u201d towels to use. Leaving the toilet water towels on the floor is a dick move though.", "YTA. When there\u2019s flooding you grab towels. Any towels. There\u2019s no such thing as nice towels, when there\u2019s flooding. There\u2019s only towels. Also they\u2019re only towels. The reusing of the toilet towel to act as come sort of place mat for the cats feeding is weird. But moving your cats dishes for a feeding instead of just cleaning the floor is lazy, and also weird.
