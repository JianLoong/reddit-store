That's ridiculous.", "What were you thinking? You can put a name, telephone number and maybe email there, but the address?

As now known, identifiable keys lead to trouble and hope her work knows as they are pretty vulnerable at moment. But she agreed to it and is the key loser.

You just handed someone access to all of her personal belongings the next time the keys were lost. Of course this was going to backfire! Your sister can't be mad at you when she went along with this idea. I hope you both learned a big lesson. Your sister needs to change her locks and freeze her credit ASAP. Sorry you all are dealing with this.\n\nEdit to add: She's your little sister even though she's an adult. She likely looks to you for guidance. You led her with a really bad idea. She still had the opportunity to oppose it, but neither of you were thinking straight. I'm not sure if you live someplace you assume is relatively safe where you leave everything unlocked because you can trust everyone, but this mentality is not a good one.
