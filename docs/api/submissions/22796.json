I don't hear any beeps, so maybe the car isn't here.\n\nGood thing there's an address on these keys.\n\nI ask my buddy to detour. Just out of curiosity. We ain't got fuck all to do today and this address is only like a mile from his place anyway.\n\nWe drive by the house slowly. I click the keys and the matching car lights up and beeps. \n\nNot even sixty seconds later and I'm driving behind my buddy. We take it back to his place and strip it as best we can, call over my guy and sell him the parts we have no use for. After a few drinks the clock reads midnight and we're ready to dump this car.\n\n(That's just like a guess on the scenario. You're being kind of an ass right now btw)", "I agree, idk why you\u2019re the only one asking these questions so far lol", "It's all very plausible, but I'm not going lay everything out in detail here to give people more ideas. I will say most people go as a group or meet up with a group at amusement parks. Patrons tend to stay at amusement parks for many hours, if not all day, between all the wait times and making the most of travel time + ticket costs. So yes, a lot of things can happen by the time someone goes to leave Six Flags. Especially when you lose your entire set of house, work, and car keys there.", "This story is one \"human trafficking\" reference away from a Facebook post...", "Are you familiar with New Jersey or six flags at all?", "It was a serious question and I am concerned about OPs and the sisters welfare because what he or she did was incredibly dangerous and could of got the sister harmed or killed. And since OPs lack of awareness put their sister in danger then they could put themselves in danger too.", "It\u2019s not \u201cinternet diagnosis\u201d to acknowledge the existence of reasons why someone might frequently misplace objects.", "Doesn't change the fact OP contributed to her being in danger by having the bright idea of putting all her personal info on her keys in the first place.", "And yet it was OP's stupid idea in the first place.  An idea that they failed to think of any consequences from, and are now vigorously defending in the comments.\n\nAnd the sister is also old enough to take the consequences, the ORIGINAL consequences, of losing her keys.  OP made it SO MUCH WORSE and could have got her killed.  Still could, actually.  I leave you with a meme:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgflip.com/4ajib1.png](https://i.imgflip.com/4ajib1.png)", "Yes\u2026", "It's curious. I've been taught by my parents the rule \"don't touch other people's things without their permission\". So I always ask first to do X because of Y and only after the positive answer I will actually do it.\n\nAnd I must admit that I expect the same approach from other people towards me.\n\nETA I am obviously not debating, but it's really curious fir me how different dynamic is in different families :)", "Of course. Thanks for asking. Cheers! \ud83e\udd42", "Got it, so the car thieves are also house burglars. And again, they work in pairs so it was convenient that they were together to rob the house but then decide to only steal the car and *not* rob the house.\n\nLucky for the OP, I guess.", "ok", "So, in this scenario, you and your buddy are both serial car thieves (since a chop shop is involved) and just happened to be wandering around six flags together? Is that someone car thieves do? Go on a few coasters in between searching for lost keys after having dropped a $100/ticket?\n\nIn any part of this, does the thought that the story is made up seem just a tad more plausible?", "Me neither. And actually, the more I think about the story, the more ridiculous it sounds.", "I officially give up.", "YOU DID THIS IN JERSEY???  \n\n\nInfo: please seriously give us the reason you want your sister to be attacked or worse, because at this point you're ignoring all the reasonable answers so you've got to be here for some insane unreasonable reason right?   \n\n\nYou know there are hitmen, you don't have to play this weird game of getting her killed by proxy. Jesus christ.", "Yes to both but feel free to enlighten me anyway", "Yeah such as the fact they're just super forgetful. You have no way of knowing if they're nd except from your armchair diagnosis", "I guess what seems bonkers to me about this one is the amount of folks like yourself totally ignoring that this entire thing hinges on the sister losing her keys at alarming consistency and everyone just accepting that as a fact of life. The tag is an awful idea, agreed. But it's not the core problem. \n\nThe car would have been stolen either way, and the registration would have had her name and address in the glove box (or wherever it is, but is required to be in the car). In the US you can search state DMV pages against registration info and go to county records sites and find a person's address in about 10 minutes. If they chopped the car, they are also going to pull that info.\n\nWhat stops that from happening isn't the tag, it's not losing your keys.", "That\u2019s fair, and probably a better approach than just doing. \n\nYeah, no worries. Definitely curious and interesting to see the different dynamics. I like to ask and learn, it helps me navigate situations I wouldn\u2019t otherwise understand.", "> so the car thieves are also house burglars\n\nCriminals are criminals, yeah.\n\n> they work in pairs so it was convenient[....]\n\nCriminals typically know other criminals to help with crime.\n\n> then decide to only steal the car and *not* rob the house\n\nOpportunities multiply as they are seized - but getting away with it takes precedence over sticking around too long to see what else could be there", "I mean I have no idea where OP lives or what kind of place it is. But here there is a couple of spots where the people sanding off engine numbers or whatever you do to resell a stolen car are number 1 \"employer\" for the teens from shitty homes. \n\nThe kids steal cars for them and help around shops.", "Someone loses an anonymous set of keys.\n\nSomeone picks up those keys.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nNothing, unless the first person is also loudly declaiming within earshot \"COME LOOT MY CAR AND MY HOUSE AT XYZ ADDRESS.\"  \n\n\nI'm not ignoring something that you're simply making up.  I'm saying that putting an address on a set of keys is dangerous, stupid, and something the OP finds absolutely no problem with.", "Maybe I misread, but didn\u2019t OP say that when sister returned home her car had been stolen? As in, she wasn\u2019t in her car that day, presumably having travelled with others, and therefore the car wouldn\u2019t have been stolen if it didn\u2019t have the address on it?", "Some people seem to think I'm saying that cars don't get stolen - I'm not. Cars get stolen every day. Especially Kias and Hyundais.\n\nI'm saying that the story the OP is telling is bull for many reasons that keep multiplying the more I reflect on it.", "I mean it seems your only points are that \n\n1. It would have to be 2 people who know a chop shop\n\n2. They didn't rob a house \n\nIMO sounds plausible if it was for example a band of teenagers they don't even have to have criminal connections themselves just a classmate with one. Which if it is an area like that is not that hard (again no clue what type of place OP's sister lives at)", "You seem to think that cars get stolen by professional or \"serial car thieves\" and no one else. Most crimes are crimes of opportunity. OP and his sister provided that opportunity. I may not be a car thief, but I sure am now after finding keys with an address on them lol. \n\nA chop shop isn't the black market underground, dude. You can even just bring it to your own garage and sell the parts. It's way easier than you seem to think it is.", "Car thieves aren't working 24/7. Some of them probably even have families and do things together like go to Six Flags on the weekend. It was a crime of opportunity. They didn't even have to be serial car thieves, could easily have been a couple of lowlifes who thought hey, let's see what we can get away with. Or found the keys, called someone they knew who did that kind of thing and offered the keys in exchange for a finder's fee. Maybe the story is BS but there are any number of plausible possibilities.", "No, to those points you can add:\n\n3. the keys found didn't match a car in the parking lot, but a car parked at home, and the thieves figured this out by walking through a lot with 5,000 cars and verifying the car wasn't there\n\n4. this \"band of teenagers\" happened to be at six flags together, stumbled on the keys, and jumped on this oppourtunity\n\n5. the car didn't just get stolen and disappear, it turned up at this \"chop shop\" where it was found after being stripped", ">Car thieves aren't working 24/7. Some of them probably even have families and do things together like go to Six Flags on the weekend. It was a crime of opportunity. \n\nMy point isn't that the story is literally impossible. But can you seriously read what I quoted and say that sounds more likely than the story being made up?", "So the story being made up is more likely than the possibility that one or two of the thousands of people who visit Six Flags every day might possibly be a thief? No, I don't agree with that. Equally possible? Sure. But not more."]}
