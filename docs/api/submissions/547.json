It was a shock for everyone but we all supported him.\n\nTheir wedding is at the end of November and everyone is doing their best to help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother invited Vi and her family. Vi just turned 20 while her parents are the same age as my parents. When her parents came to Germany my family helped them a lot and in return Vi\u2019s parents babysat me and my brother a lot. Her parents are our second parents, my bro even calls Vi\u2019s dad regularly and they talk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow this is important, Vi and her family are doing a lot for the wedding. Her parents help with decorations and ceremony planning and Vi designed the invitation card AND drew small chibi sketches of EVERY PERSON ATTENDING! All for fucking free. Yeah. Free.  \nAll they ask for return is a nice seat at the wedding and their gas prices to be paid. They drive 2 hours to get here and 2 hours to go back EVERY SUNDAY SINCE JANUARY! Both my brother and SIL did try to give them money for their work but they decline it, my brother cried happiness when he saw the decoration and so did SIL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never really had time to bond with SIL alone and last Monday I did, we went for some coffee. The first 30 minutes it was nice and we had fun. Vi called me to chat but I told her I was busy and will call back later. When I hung up, I realized how weird SIL looked and I asked what was wrong. She told me the last month she grew \u201edisgusted\u201c with Vi and her parents. I asked why and she said the age gap is huge between them and that they ask for a lot when they come over. Angry was an understatement. Her mother had 6 miscarriages until Vi came, and they only ask for the gas price and breakfast. Persian breakfast is literally just bread, cucumber and cheese. I was furious and called her out on this and she cried begging me to keep this secret between \u201etwo sisters\u201c.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was too angry, I stormed off and told Mom. On my way I also called Vi and her mother picked up and I told her everything. Her mother thanked me and hung up. \n\nMy parents are furious at Vi and refuse to help or attend the wedding UNTIL SIL apologizes to Vi and her parents. Vi called me and she was mad, saying that SIL was already being a \u201ebridezilla\u201c in private and now she also made her mom cry. I saw some screenshots and apparently Vi had drawn over 300 sketches until SIL was \"okay\" with them. Though SIL blames it on her OCD (idk if she has it or not)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother is keeping himself distant because he agrees SIL messed up but \u201ehe has to respect his wife\u201c bs. SIL and her family have been blowing up my phone about how I am a snitch and a jealous \u201ebitch\u201c. I am angry at what my SIL said but I also think I ruined her marriage? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is so many conflicting feelings I am feeling so AITA?", "created_utc": 1667158726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhnqur/aita_for_revealing_my_sil_secret_to_my_parents/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My background is Polish.\n\nAnyhow, I know large families.\n\nI think you are, indeed, a snitch. And what you did, ratting her out before the wedding, was an Arschlochmove. Peak asshole move in fact!\n\nYou have no right to interfere like this on someone else's wedding. And you did it the most stupid way possible.\n\nLearn some basic skills in how to handle delicate subjects at least! You could have asked Vi about her opinion on your SIL, and about your feeling of her maybe being a bit entitled, or looking ungrateful lately.\n\nStart a conversation without full on causing drama.\n\nGet second and third opinions. Make sure everyone looks a little bit sharper at what she is doing.\n\nLet her ruin her standing all by herself.\n\nNow to your brother. The right thing would have been to call him and tell him about what your SIL said, and how you're upset about it. Tell him to talk to her, or you will not stay silent forever about the mistreatment of family. Even if it's 'only' chosen family!\n\nYou made him pick a side, and he does the right thing by backing up his future wife and mother of his children, without fully stirring more shit that you already started.\n\nHe could've chosen to stand with his blood family, that would bring him in another impossible decision. He can only lose now, because of how you handled it.\n\nYou could've not made it a them Vs us. That is on you alone.\n\nShe still said some awful things and is entitled af.

I really don't think that served any purpose. Had you not said anything your SIL would have left that coffee shop feeling like she was wrong and with a better attitude.  No one would have had their feelings hurt, and there would be no conflict.\n\nBut by blabbing what she said to everyone, you've hurt a bunch of people's feelings and publicly humiliated someone who had already learned their lesson.", ">My parents are furious at Vi\n\nINFO: Um, why?", "If something this simple destroys their marriage, then it won\u2019t last very long or be a happy one. \nNTA.

Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness, especially when Vi\u2019s family had gone to such lengths to help. They sound like amazing people.", "NTA you are not revealing a secret.
