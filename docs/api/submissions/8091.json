My eldest sister is the golden child in our family. Always did the best in school, smart, beautiful and very conformist. Did everything by the book, best college, biomedical engineering degree, now does R&D for drugs. \n\nMy middle sister is kind of the black sheep. When she was 17 she got involved with some shitty friends who introduced her to an older guy. He was 12 years her senior and my parents learned about it freaked out and put a restraining order and put up security cameras and did everything to prevent them from meeting. Then she ran away from home at 19 to be with him. My parents tried to get her to come back but she moved in with him and they got engaged.\n\nAt 22 she tried to run away. He was abusive (I won\u2019t get into detail as not to get banned) and she tried to get away. My eldest sister lived 2h away at the time and agreed to take her in. My eldest sister let her stay with her bf and her in their apartment. She stayed for 2 months and then contacted her ex again and \u201ctried to make things work\u201d. He came over and a fight between eldest sister\u2019s bf and her ex started. I\u2019m not sure exactly why she said her sister\u2019s bf started it but my eldest sister said her ex tried to break in. \n\nIt involved the police and my eldest sister was pissed at my middle sister and cut her out of her life after she went back to her ex. Refused to speak to our sister and I was across the country studying at the time so I couldn\u2019t help. \n\nNow my sister is trying to run away again and my parents and I want my eldest sister to help. Her and her now husband live in a gated community about 45 min from the city so my sister can still work and commute back and forward. My sister has a baby who is immune compromised and going to a shelter is not an option. She also doesn\u2019t have money to put down for a place and her ex used her credit and ruined it. My parents want her to come to live with them but she lives 6h away and wouldn\u2019t be able to work. \n\nMy eldest sister wouldn\u2019t reply to her calls and just said sent her a text saying she wouldn\u2019t put her family in danger over her shitty choices and she was going to run back to her red neck ex even if she did help. It was extremely shitty to say when she finally made the decision to leave and I called her to tell her what a bitch she was and how heartless she was being. She called me a little kid and told me I didn\u2019t understand how the world worked and hung up. My parents have been trying to get my eldest sister to take her in in or for her to come live with them but it looks like she might stay because she doesn\u2019t feel like she has other options.", "created_utc": 1674504430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jm156/aita_for_calling_my_sister_a_btch_and_heartless/", "score": 243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Eldest sister is right to protect herself and her relationship.   It is NOT her problem.", "YTA. Your eldest sister has already given your middle sister a lot of chances. Sounds like the middle sister ruined those chances and took advantage of your eldest sister. Not to mention, the ex tried to break into your eldest sister's home?? So your middle sister showed that not only can she not be trusted, but she seems to have no problem putting her loved ones in danger.\n\nIf I was the eldest sister, I'd want middle sister out of my life too. It sounds to me like you actually *don't* understand how hard it was for her. If you're so much better of a person than your eldest sister, why don't you take your middle sister in?", "Info: why can\u2019t your parents and/or you help?", "YTA. \n\nIt's not your place to tell your eldest sister how to live her life or use her resources. Your eldest sister has worked very hard to get where she's gotten in life, and the last time she attempted to help your ne'er-do-well middle sister, the police had to get involved. And it doesn't even seem like your middle sister has accepted responsibility for that incident\u2014she's still blaming your eldest sister's boyfriend. \n\nGiven these circumstances, you really expect your eldest sister to put herself out there again? You expect her to risk everything for which she's worked? Both of those are (to use your words) heartless.", "YTA. Your sister tried to help once and it caused nothing but trouble. Now you want to put even _more_ on her by wanting her to take in her sister and a baby. Being \"family\" and only 45 minutes away does not mean _she_ is the only one obligated to help. Especially after your middle sister put her in danger last time.\n\nNot to mention, your middle sister wouldn't have gotten into this mess if she hadn't insisted on going against the safeguards put in place for her. \n\nYour oldest sister isn't being a bitch, or heartless. She just learned her lesson. Once bitten, twice shy. Maybe you/your parents should help out.\n\nEdit: your parents even offered to let your sister stay with them, and she said no. Your oldest sister is even less of a bitch now, if the middle sister is actively turning down help. YTA for trying to pin this on your oldest sister. Props to her. I hope she doesn't give in to you.", "YTA. Have you ever heard the expression \"fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me\"?  \n\n\nThe best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Your eldest sister doesn't trust that your other sister won't pull the same nonsense she did the first time. And maybe she's wrong. But she doesn't have to put her family at risk. You and your parents believe she's for real this time, so you guys need to finance and create a new life for her if that is what you want, not put all the responsibility onto your big sister.", "Yta\n\nIt is your eldest sisters right to have in her home who she wants, if she thinks it will endanger her  family then she has a right to say no.

The eldest sister ***already*** tried to help your other sister who didn't appreciate the effort. She would have been fine if she didn't try to get in contact with her abuser again (and most likely give him the current adress so that her ex is now not only her problem ***but also*** that of her sister and her boyfriend).\n\nYour eldest sister doesn't have to suffer for the bad choices of her little sister. She doesn't have to risk her wellbeing and that of her boyfriend. Regarding her boyfriend ... this mess can  even sow discord among these two. In other words your sister also made the decision to show her boyfriend that she takes actions against people that try to make their life difficult.", "INFO  \nWhy aren't you or your parents taking her in?", "yta, your middle sister kept going back to this guy who started a fight and caused the older one trouble and you say she is heartless. I think she is just done with the chaos. Good on her.", "YTA for blaming your oldest sister. I mean, the way your oldest sister worded it wasn't the best, BUT, I do not blame her at all for not wanting to take this on again after what happened the first time.  Also, to be honest, there is a good liklihood that your sister WILL go back to her ex again.  Many, many, women do - several times - before they leave for good.  Unless your middle sister has an amazing job, with great benefits, she could most likely find another job closer to your parents, and move in with them.  I would also encourage your middle sister, you, and your parents, to look into Organizations that help women fleeing domestic violence.", "YTA-Middle sister is being entirely too choosy and your eldest sister did help the first time.

She is allowed to protect her family for anyone and everyone she deems necessary. You are the AH for calling her a bitch.

Oh if your parents really want they can drive there with a truck or uhaul pack her up and move her and you can help.", "YTA.

All of you are totally out of line and AHs to keep bugging your older sister to again put her family at risk and disrupt their lives.  Middle doesn't want to move out of state--tough cookies.  She has an option and if she cares about her immune-compromised child at all, she'll take it and go stay with your folks and get her life in order for the baby's sake.  Right now it sounds as if all she wants is somewhere to lie low for a bit before going back into the barn again.  That's her issue, not your older sister's.  Leave older alone--you've all harrassed her far too much already.  You calling her names and abusing her makes you just as big an AH as your middle sister.  Grow the F up and tell middle the same.", "YTA She does have options. Leave and live with her parents. Your oldest sister has suffered enough. You were an AH for calling her heartless.

The middle sister already almost messed up eldest sister\u2019s household one time and the returned to her ex without hearing anyone\u2019s opinion . Eldest sister has every right to not take her again and probably is making the correct decision. She messed up once, she helped her. She messed up the same way again, so she now doesn\u2019t. Life is about choices. Don\u2019t make the same mistake twice", "It's a good thing to help your immediate family, but in this case your middle sister has used up all of her credits. She needs to face her own mistakes and learn to fix them herself rather than rely on you or your eldest sister. There is danger in that, but it can't be helped. She is an adult and has to act like it.", "YTA--- Your older sister already tried, and things got physical. Why dont you help? You're a 22 year old adult. Why doesnt your mother help? Father in the picture? There are other options.", "YTA and also what your sister said - you're a child with either zero thought or care for consequence to *all* parties involved right now.\n\nyour middle sister was an (probably unwitting) accomplice to her crazy ex BREAKING INTO YOUR ELDEST SISTER'S HOME AND ASSAULTING HER HUSBAND. at what point do you start giving a damn about *their* safety? where's your empathy and compassion for them? is it only going to kick in if your eldest or her husband get assaulted a second time? what about murdered? is that when it'll sink in for you??\n\nyour sister is in a terrible spot, it's true, and i feel for her...to an extent, as this is all a domino-effect snowball from her being a headstrong teenager who believed she found true love over the objections of literally EVERYONE ELSE. because then she became a headstrong adult who first (again) *endangered her family* through her shitty choices and now is causing conflict because the options she DOES have for getting out aren't exactly what she wants. she *can* go move in with your parents but she's CHOOSING to once again make a selfish, self-centered decision. because oh, it's too far. oh, she doesn't *want* that. her parents are willing to support her and house her, so she can find a new damn job and put real distance between herself and her abuser - but she's probably not actually ready to leave, so she wants that fallback of Maybe We Can Work Out Again.\n\nwhatever her logic, the facts are that eldest has already done more than you and put her actual skin in the game and been burned by it. you, by your own admission, are not and have not been in any position to offer anything but a scolding for her not being willing to do this *twice* when you haven't done it *once*. so sit down. be supportive of your middle sister AND your eldest. and most importantly? shut up.", "YTA\n\nYour older sister already tried and the middle kid contacted the ex and told him the address.  There was an altercation, a potential break in, and police involvement.  Your middle sister doesn't get a second chance with older sister.  That's done.", "~~NAH~~ YTA- You want to help the Sister, the other Sister lived through an extremely scary and traumatic experience after she helped last time.\n\nIt would be a good deed if she continued to help, not an asshole move to not.\n\nEdit: 2nd thoughts you were an asshole for calling her a bitch over it.", "YTA, your eldest sister already tried to help the first time middle sister ran from her abuser. Only to have middle sister contact abuser, who then tried to break into your eldest sisters home and physically assaulted eldests now husband. She is not required to do anymore, she is not wrong for putting the safety and security of herself and her family first. You had no business calling your eldest sister names and inserting yourself into the situation that you are really not equipped to handle or judge.", "YTA your whole family is. Your Older Sister did take the MS in and her boyfriend came over and started a fight. Yes he did. We know this man makes shitty choices (I mean he groomed your Middle Sister from high school on) so you\u2019re not telling me he didn\u2019t start this fight. \n\nI would do the same thing. My house isn\u2019t a fighting arena and if there\u2019s a possibly he\u2019s going to track her down and start something (again, remember) then it\u2019s a no from me. What your MS wants doesn\u2019t matter here. She needs a place, your parents are offering one. She doesn\u2019t get to demand space in somebody\u2019s house because it\u2019s convenient. And she has a child?? It\u2019s beyond reasonable that somebody doesn\u2019t want a screaming baby in their home, especially if it\u2019s not theirs. \n\nIf you wanna help that bad, you go rent a place by your MS and take her in.", "YTA. \n\nYour eldest sister did take in your sister, and that resulted in the police getting involved and her boyfriend being involved in a physical altercation. \n\nWhat work has your middle sister done to show that this won't happen again? Now there is a child involved which makes the situation scarier, and a gate doesn't protect a home if the gate is opened to someone, and your older sister has no reason to believe that your middle sister won't let this guy in. Why is your sister responsible to help when no other help has worked?\n\nPut it a different way: you are worried about your middle sister getting away from this guy, but apparently do not think your older sister should get to be worried for the exact same reasons. Your sister has demonstrated she will go back to this guy, and she will endanger her family to get back with him. This time, she may invite him in and someone- likely the husband- could end up injured. Why are you so heartless that you would want to put your sister in danger?\n\nI get that you are scared and frustrated, but name calling and making your older sister feel bad for protecting herself- from the same stuff that worries you about your middle sister- isn't going to help. If you read anything about interventions/ways to deal with family who are addicts, one of the main themes is to establish boundaries, cut people off, and protect yourself. Your older sister is protecting her home and her family, and she has done nothing to put them in danger. \n\nYour middle sister just doesn't like her other options: she can move in with your parents, but it is far away from this man, that's a red flag that she isn't really ready to leave. There are shelters for domestic abuse victims, and they would keep the baby who is immune compromised just as safe as almost any other environment. You all have just decided that the eldest sister, with her \"gated community\" is the right choice, likely because it has the least impact on all of YOU, because now your middle sister is her problem. Focus your anger on where the problem actually is, and that is with your middle sister and her decisions.", "YTA.  YTA.  YTA.  Your eldest sister is trying to protect her family.

The audacity. She already helped her and in return got her house broken into, her bf attacked, the police called and lies told on her bf.

I would cut contact with the whole lot of you.", "YTA\n\nYour oldest sister and her partner put themselves at risk for your other sister.

She's already burned her bridge with the oldest sister, and I don't blame her a bit.  YTA.", "Unfortunately sounds like your middle sister really isn't ready to leave him again or she would be willing to move into your parents home and get a different job.  If she keeps the same job then he can simply just follow to where ever she moves to next. \n\nYour older sister is protecting her family, when the victim finally leaves an abuser.  Him murdering her and the whole family risk really goes up. \n\nYou are putting this all on your older sister instead of you or the parent flying or driving to her and moving her out and as far away from the abuser as possible.  More distance between Her and the abuser the better.  \n\nBreaking the cycle is hard and your middle sister will need lots of help in therapy to keep from boing back to him or into another relationship with another abuser. \n\nYou are way underplaying the risk of him murdering her and everyone who helps her.", "YTA. Adults leaving an abusive situation are not \"running away,\" they are escaping or just leaving. Running away is for kids. The fact you use that wording shows your oldest sister is right, you are a child. Refusing to live with your parents shows your middle sister isn't ready to end things. It has nothing to do with a gated community, it had to do with being close enough to go back to him.", "YTA. As the older sister of a younger sis who has never managed to stabilize, you can't help someone who isn't ready to be helped. I have flown my own sister across the country, had her stay in my apartment, sent her money and food, and in the long run it didn't make any positive changes in her life. I was just enabling her in her bad decision-making. \n\nMost people take several attempts to leave abusive relationships. My sister was in one, and I tried to help her get out but I couldn't. She had to be ready herself. Your older sister learned the hard way that her own sister is in such a bad place mentally that she will threaten the safety of her own sister and her sister's family yo maintain her unhealthy attachment. It's really easy to judge from where you are, because you aren't the one your sister will put at risk. Has it occurred to you that your sister's abusive partner could show up and murder both of your sisters? \n\nIf your middle sister were serious about leaving, she would move away with your parents. Your older sister is smart enough to see she is being called upon as \"the stable one\" to put herself at risk to try to save your middle sister from herself, yet again. No sibling should have to light themselves on fire to keep another sibling warm.", "YTA \n\nA lot of big talk from you about how big sister should help - and she already did and it got dangerous for her - why don't YOU and your parents help middle sis this time?", "Your middle sister has the option of moving back with your parents (I assume rent free).

The very best thing that could happen is that your middle sister jacks the job in, takes the bsby, and moves 6 hours away from her obviously dangerous bf. I'd hazard a guess that the dangerous bf will follow middle sister home from work, and try and break in again. Your eldest sister is probably sick of being expected to step in and rescue your middle sister when it gets thrown back in her face. The thing is that your middle sister *does* have other options. She has other, safer opitions.

From your descriptions of your siblings it also sounds like you have issues with your eldest sister doing well and you\u2019re shooting your middle sister bail for her poor choices.

Those of us who haven't been in an abusive relationship might be quick to say \"why isn't this person leaving their abuser? At this point, they're a lost cause\" but if everyone around them says that, then they only get further isolated and are more likely indeed to stay. This isn't unusual behavior or signs she'll never leave eventually.\n\nI think the family would be AHs to continue to pressure your eldest sister though so I'd explore other options. Something the domestic violence shelter I volunteered at did for survivors during COVID was to offer hotel stays. If that's not an option where she is, could your parents be able to afford a hotel room to do something like this? Also, even if nearby shelters don't have the funding/ability to do so, they can help your sister safety plan and figure out how to leave safely. They also usually have staff or connections to people who can help file restraining orders, connect to resources, etc. I would still encourage her (if she isn't already) to contact a shelter for help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My eldest sister is 27 and my other sister is 25. My eldest sister is the golden child in our family. Always did the best in school, smart, beautiful and very conformist. Did everything by the book, best college, biomedical engineering degree, now does R&D for drugs. \n\nMy middle sister is kind of the black sheep. When she was 17 she got involved with some shitty friends who introduced her to an older guy. He was 12 years her senior and my parents learned about it freaked out and put a restraining order and put up security cameras and did everything to prevent them from meeting. Then she ran away from home at 19 to be with him. My parents tried to get her to come back but she moved in with him and they got engaged.\n\nAt 22 she tried to run away. He was abusive (I won\u2019t get into detail as not to get banned) and she tried to get away. My eldest sister lives 2h away and agreed to take her in. My eldest sister let her stay with her bf and her in their apartment. She stayed for 2 months and then contacted her ex again and \u201ctried to make things work\u201d. He came over and a fight between eldest sister\u2019s bf and her ex started. I\u2019m not sure exactly why she said her sister\u2019s bf started it but my eldest sister said her ex tried to break in. \n\nIt involved the police and my eldest sister was pissed at her and cut her out of her life. Refused to speak to our sister and I was across the country studying at the time so I couldn\u2019t help. \n\nNow my sister is trying to run away again and my parents and I want my eldest sister to help. Her and her now husband live in a gated community about 45 min from the city so my sister can still work and commute back and forward. My sister has a baby who is immune compromised and going to a shelter is not an option. She also doesn\u2019t have money to put down for a place and her ex used her credit and ruined it. My parents want her to come to live with them but she lives 6h away and wouldn\u2019t be able to work. \n\nMy eldest sister wouldn\u2019t reply to her calls and just said sent her a text saying she wouldn\u2019t put her family in danger over her shitty choices and she was probably going to run back to her red neck ex even if she did help. It was extremely shitty to say when she finally made the decision to leave and I called her to tell her what a bitch she was and how heartless she was being. She called me a little kid and told me I didn\u2019t understand how the world worked and hung up. My parents have been trying to get my eldest sister to take her in in or for her to come live with them but it looks like she might stay because she doesn\u2019t feel like she has other options.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
