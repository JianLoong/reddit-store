I have explicitly and politely explained to him that if i do extend my stay i'd be really troubled since no one would be there to move my stuff while he hands over the house to the new owner. But he refuses to understand my position and also has made rude remarks about my personality like calling me a person with a black heart and such.\n\nHe has also incited my current housemate in ways that he also picks verbal fights with me for putting him in trouble by moving out ad not paying the rent for December.Am i really the asshole in this situation?

That's is not your problem. He is trying to presume on your friendship.

You acted according to the contract, and your landlord's demands appear unreasonable and threatening. It's always important to seek external opinions, and it's clear that you are looking for different perspectives to make a more informed decision about your friendship.  \n\n\nIn this situation, it's essential to evaluate the facts. You have followed the terms of your rental agreement, which stipulates that you need to inform the landlord one month prior to moving out. You provided this notice correctly by informing him on the 24th of October about your departure on the 24th of November, which adheres to local government rules.\r  \n\r  \nGiven the circumstances, your landlord's demand for an additional month's rent (for December) seems unjustified and not in line with the agreement you both had.

If you pay even though you don\u2018t have to is fully on your goodwill. \n\nHowever, it will put a dent in the good relationship with your landlord and housemate. I don\u2018t think your landlord will change their position even if you\u2018re legally in the clear. So it\u2018s the question whether you want to risk the relationship or not.", "Has he charged you cheaper rent because he's a friend? If so, I'd be tempted to give him an extra week or 2 of rent as payback for that. Otherwise, I wouldn't because I've followed all the legal requirements when moving out. Also, his utter rudeness would be making me less likely to consider helping him even if the rent was below market value. \n\nMoving out is a normal part of tenancy and a landlord knows that they'll usually be without rent for a short period during the changeover. He shouldn't be harassing you for extra money - it's taking advantage of the friendship and inevitably jeopardising it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA, you are sticking to your tenancy agreement and the local rules. All you had to do was give a month's notice, and you've done that. Sounds like he's just annoyed that he's missing out on a bit of money while he waits to find a new tenant... almost like that's part of the risk that being a landlord entails. Tell him if he's worried about his finances he can always go find a real job, he's not cut out to be a landlord if he tries to bully tenants into paying extra rent for a house they're not living in and aren't contracted to.", "NTA.

If that is how tendency works in your area, then that is how tendency works. Obviously things are harder and more complicated emotionally with friends, but that understanding needs to flow both ways and it wasn't in this case he was only thinking about what was easy and convenient for him", "NTA.  Stop talking and start typing. Send emails.  He is wrong and knows it. He thinks he can make you pay for a month you are not there.  You are not obligated as you have notified him.", "NTA but I guarantee you won't be getting your security deposit back.", "NTA unless you owe it. Tell him to get a job and that should help", "NTA.

Their financial issues are not yours and to put that pressure on you is very A holy of him to do and not something a friend would do. \nAs long as you're abiding by the leasing contract then you are doing nothing wrong.

You\u2018ve known each other and have been friends for 9 years and then you get up and leave within a month. I guess he expected a bit more after that long of a time, maybe that you tell him sooner or offer some curtesy payment for your last month in the house, because well, you were friends and not just tenant-landlord. \n\nIt\u2018s always tricky when a relationship which is ultimately a financial one or professional one moves into friendship territory and it can end up messy, like here. It\u2018s really your decision on what note you want to end this relationship: as tenant-landlord (then you don\u2018t pay) or friends. In the later case I would really try to talk to him and try to come up with a compromise (maybe pay half the rent out of curtesy).", "The main reason for asking this is that in the last conversation we had i ended up telling him that i no longer want our friendship to exist.
