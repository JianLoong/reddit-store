It's not hard to ask who you live with if they want some pancakes. Just make a bigger batch.", "Info - how do you fuck up boiling pasta? Genuinely curious. Cos you just, boil/simmer water, add pasta, stir occasionally, 10 or so minutes later it's done (depending on how firm or baby food you like it)", "NTA, just don\u2019t expect them to return the favor.", "NTA\n\nShe's just making excuses for you to do her dirty work. If she wants pancakes, she better make her own goddamn pancakes and leave you alone.", "NTA cooking takes time and it obviously takes longer when you cook for more people, even without factoring in the anxiety. Lol tell her you're a shitty cook and you're doing her a favor by only cooking for people that actually are nice to you", "NTA\n\nYour explanation re. not having time was reasonable and the aunt should really have accepted it at face value.  Your anxiety around cooking for groups is also totally understandable - if you feel comfortable sharing that kind of information, maybe you could let the family know that this is something you struggle with, but you\u2019re happy to contribute in other ways (cleaning, helping with DIY projects etc)?  Getting that out in the open might avoid future awkwardness and make it clear that you\u2019re not just shirking off from doing stuff for the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In most households I've been to it's commonplace that everyone makes their own food if they're hungry unless it's an agreed upon meal time or they are children. And that's beautiful because it gives everyone independence which people need.", "NTA as the aunt has no right to expect pancakes from you, but it would have been a nice thing to do to cook some extras and leave them in case anybody is in the mood for pancakes. Cook for three instead of two for example.", "NTA but if failing to boil pasta is enough to put you in a breakdown, you have bigger issues in life.", "NTA- She just wanted pancakes and wanted you to feel bad for not making them.\n\nI am a burnt out people pleaser.  I know what stress and anxiety and depression tell you.\n\nI want you to remember that they lie.", "It is unusual not to make pancakes for everyone but not an asshole move. NAH\n\nHowever OP you really need some therapy and identifying what is causing this food issue. It is not normal and very *unhealthy* for you to struggle to make pasta. You deserve some closure on that so you can live a more overall fulfilling life.", "NTA.", "NTA. But now I want pancakes.", "Listen to your friend.

If the personal reasons include your family using violence due to cooking accidents then there might be some trauma involved which would explain alot. However without this bigger picture it's hard making a call here.
