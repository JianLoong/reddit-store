I ( 29F) am here with my partner (31M). We flew in from Paris.\n\nWe were all invited to dinner by step-mother's sister and husband. I haven't seen these people in six years. As soon as the husband opened the door, he asked me what they're feeding me over in Paris. I laughed it off because boomer humour and it's true I gained weight in the last six years. However, it's not a life changing amount. Not five minutes later, he asks me the same thing again. I laugh it off because what am I supposed to do? He's also already a bit drunk.\n\nFast forward and we're all at the table. He starts bashing Paris, saying he felt \"like a minority\" there because of all the immigrants and telling my French partner all French people are socialists (we're both left wing so the comment didn't necessary bother us but he obviously meant it as an insult). But wait, there's more. Out of nowhere, he start telling us how the situation in their country is degrading because, yes, you guessed it, the GAYS.\n\nMy father warned me about his views and asked me not to get into arguments with him to avoid a confrontation so even though I was very angry by this point I tried to change the subject. All was well for five minutes, until he turned to my partner and asked \"What do you feed your partner with? Last time she was here, she was skinny and it looks like she gained 30 kilos.\" (not true)\n\nIn the middle of his question I said, \"That's not nice\" but he didn't stop so I stood up, left the table, left the house and went to chill on the curb. My partner came after me, then my father too and my father asked if I want to go home. I said yes, even thought I hadn't planned on it. We left.\n\nHowever, I can't stop thinking that I was a bit of an A to my step-mother and her sister. I didn't go back to say goodbye to anybody, I just got in the car and my dad drove me and my partner home. His wife cooked all day long and apparently she shouted at him as soon as I left the table. I know what he said to me was not OK and I was disgusted by his racist, bigoted comments. But AITA to the rest of the family for ruining dinner?\n\nEDIT: I wrote mother in law instead of step-mother.", "created_utc": 1691371825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15k6p6p/aita_for_ruining_family_dinner_because_a_guy/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's like he wanted to ruin it. You're under no obligation to be nice to a rude xenophobic bigot. TBH, you handled it a lot more politely than I would have.", "NTA you were a guest and he was openly insulting you over and over. I wouldn't have stayed there and taken his insults either.", "NTA\n\nThat'll guy was rude, insensitive and just mean. His comments were unnecessary and you felt uncomfortable. You were well within your right to leave.", "NTA. Not at all, even one little bit. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that jerk.", "You didn\u2019t ruin dinner, he did.\n\nNTA", "YOU didn\u2019t ruin the dinner\u2014HE did.\n\nI applaud your restraint in lasting as long as you did.\n\nYou might send an email or text to your hostess and apologize for not being able to stay.  Explain just how uncomfortable you had become and feared that things might escalate to a point where serious and permanent damage might result.", "Definitely NTA!  The others should have stepped in before you had to leave the house. What he said to you, multiple times, was disrespectful, and hurtful. Never mind all the other bigoted comments he made. He\u2019s just lucky you didn\u2019t dump your dinner on his miserable head!!!\nAnd good for your partner and dad for standing up for you!!", "The victim often feels guilty when someone is so out of line. Deep down there's some internal feeling, like yeah but if I didn't exist... that would not have happened. We feel our very presence. \n\nAbusers know this. This man was a narcissist, and his ego ship was sinking for whatever reason (sounds like hateful politics), and he was going to take you down with him. It's as simple as that. \n\nAnd the truth is, it works and they know it works. It hurts. You go down with the ship. If you do the right thing everyone is affected. Well the truth is, everyone was already affected. \n\nUnderstand the guilt is weirdly natural and accept that this man has destroyed an evening and some relationships. That is all. \n\nOh NTA", "NTA.\n\nClearly your partner and father agreed with you, because your father asked if you wanted to leave.\n\nThe boorish, insensitive twatzi ruined dinner with his behaviour. You did not.\n\nWhy are WE always the ones who have to keep the peace? Why wasn't he warned on pain of sleeping on the porch for a month to keep his bigoted views to himself?", "NTA.\n\nBut a lot of the other people there might be. I can't believe that nobody else there shut him down on how rude he was being to you, over and over. Frankly, I wouldn't want to have dinner with them if that's how little they care.", "Obviously, NTA \n\nNo one is entitled to demand you sit quietly to be insulted - not even by drunken relatives. \n\nIn future, you can try saying things like, \"let's change the subject,\" but when someone continues and no one else speaks up, it's perfectly acceptable to say to your host that you really aren't feeling like sticking around to be insulted. \n\nI usually make it a bit more pointed - something like, \"I realize you can't control your guests, but I'm afraid I just don't feel up to continued insults this evening. Thank you for inviting me, and for the rest of your hospitality.\"\n\nYour host really should have spoken up. My guess - having a drunken cousin of my own - is that they've let him get away with this sort of thing, and he thinks he's being clever and funny. \n\nHe wouldn't continue the behavior if people spoke up when he does it.", "[removed]", "NTA   Call them if you're bothered (MIL and sister). I'm sure they are sympathetic to you, and won't hold it against you. But don't go back if dipshit is there.", "NTA - You're not the one who who ruined dinner. And why go back and say goodbye to people who did not even say anything about this bigoted AH.", "NTA. They all heard it and didn\u2019t say a word. Why would you want to stay around people who accept that abusive language?", "NTA. The time for MIL's sister to say something was when her husband made the first rude comment.

You handled that very well.  \n\n\nMy mothers best friend is racist and homophobic in a \"I know he's guy, and I am fine with that but does he have to dress so loudly??\" (we're talking black salsa esque clothes with sparkly shoulder pad vibes to sing a song on stage) and other similar comments and its all I hear at christmas from my brother (alongside his mysoginy) and her best friend and I just hold my tongue because *christmas* and you can't upset *mum at christmas* with conflict - better we all just pretend.  \n\n\n1000% wish I could walk out - but its that annoying micro aggression shit that is subtle enough they shout \"IM NOT BEEN RACIST - IM BEEN AUSTRALIAN MATE\" and by last year I was just so exhausted from it - I just napped with my dogs, or walked my dogs any opportunity I could get.", "Ha, the classic mistranslation of belle-m\u00e8re ;)\nNTA, I would have blown up against the crass stupidity of this individual....
