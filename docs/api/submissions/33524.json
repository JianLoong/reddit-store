I completely see why you're upset.  ...and now your wife is upset and I'd be surprised if her siblings don't villainize you for the foreseeable future.

It\u2019s shitty that the bro is so self absorbed & can\u2019t be bothered to lift a finger to help in non monetary ways while he is without employment.  The bro could always spring clean/ scrub the parent\u2019s house/ room prior to putting in the new lounge suit. Wouldn\u2019t cost him money & would show he wants to help!", "NTA, you're right not to add his name if he doesn't contribute anything at all.  Your wife is enabling this poor behaviour and if he can't step up in any way his name shouldn't be on the card.  Aren't we all sad at times but we carry on!", "Very mild ESH except your wife. Obviously your BIL should have been contributing to the gift through effort if he couldn\u2019t contribute through money and I totally get why you\u2019re upset about it. But it\u2019s not your brother or your parents, and if your wife and her other siblings are okay with putting his name on the present I don\u2019t think you should be the one to stir the pot.", "YTA. Your wife decided to cover his portion. That was not contingent on him helping out. \n\nIf I was him I would not join the shopping- it is not my money and not my decision.\n\nAlso, he told you he was too busy to shop, why did you think he suddenly wasn\u2019t when you were ready to buy? Just because he\u2019s out of work does not mean he\u2019s at your beck and call.", "NTA, he is not paying for not helping with and not picking the gift but he wants free credit for existing?", "ESH.  It is your wife's call it is her family.  And if you are going to put a condition on something, like you need to help or your name won't be on it, you need to do that up front", "ESH. Your BIL, for obvious reasons. Your wife, for enabling him and covering up for him. You, my friend, for being petty about it. I'm sorry. Do better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
