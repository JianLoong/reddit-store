Idk about anybody else and how they may move or operate, but for BUSTAKITA - that would not, could not and never would fly with ME AT ALL! HELL NAWL TO THE NAWL NAWL NAWL! POINT BLANK PERIODT!!

He did decline the sibling group shopping trips.", "But it\u2019s HIS money, and it is his BIL.", "ESH indeed.  OP is created drama with the in-laws and his wife over what?  A name on a gift.  This is not worth fighting over, however covering BILs portion is your xmas gift to him this year.", "I feel like OP and so many people responding aren\u2019t picking up that the nonpaying brother\u2019s portion is really irrelevant. \n\nIf OP were uncomfortable with paying the $2000 or paying 2/3 of the total while the other paying siblings pay the remaining third, okay, fair enough, that\u2019s his money too, and he should get some say.\n\nBut the time to object was when the money was originally divided. The brother is really just getting him name attached to the  gift, and the other siblings know it and want him included in a gift to the parents. Anyone removed from the situation can see that reality clearly. There\u2019s no actual portion from the brother! Attaching the brother\u2019s name to the $2000 portion from OP\u2019s wife makes it so all of the siblings\u2019 shares are more even. That was the actual point\u2014It made the siblings feel more equal. \n\nLike, at no point was the non-paying brother ever paying, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone suggested that he otherwise contribute. Maybe he should have or could have, but no one was making that a requirement for his name being present. \n\nEven now, what does OP think is going to happen? He said that another sibling could cover the brother\u2019s portion! Another sibling who is paying will just claim the brother\u2019s \u201cportion\u201d (which was never an actual portion) and the brother\u2019s name will go on the gift and all OP has done is cause stress among the siblings and fought with his wife.", "And more than anything else HE told his wife they weren't covering her brothers portion. That is not an acceptable way to interact with your spouse. You could say I don't think we should, or I am not comfortable, and many other things, but you don't tell them how to handle their family.", "BIL is probably embarrassed that he doesn\u2019t have any money and being involved in the process just rubs it in", "Except OP didn\u2019t choose the gift.

And OP\u2019s sister was ok with that. We have zero idea what he was doing to be \u201cbusy.\u201d Was he with their kids so his spouse could shop? Was he having job interviews? Was he networking? Was he at doctors\u2019 appointments/car appointments/errands that could not be put off? We don\u2019t know except that he was busy.", "Ima go ahead and say this is not the first time, not even close, that OP's wife bails out / cuddles her brother. She's an enabler. People like BIL are not excellent human beings and then all of a sudden they do this shit completely out of the blue.", "This is the way.", "Yes, because that was the very first time OP mentioned the idea of getting a couch for the parents to him - the exact moment after they purchased the couch and sat waiting with it on the sidewalk in front of the store. Sure, they\u2019d been inviting him to join them in searching for the perfect couch each and every week for weeks, including that very day, but somehow he had no idea what was going on or ever considered that they may need his help in any way. I mean, other people were able to help out, but it was just too much for him.\n\nOne would think he doesn\u2019t actually want to be in on the couch gift anyway.", "Do you really in your heart believe this was a timing issue? Because I\u2019m really doubting that. BIL just didn\u2019t care to participate, or he would have. Keep in mind, these are his parents are they not?

They were pretty sure what she\u2019d like visually, and they consulted SIL and me on what would be most practical in terms of strap/handles, number of compartments/pockets, etc. I\u2019d argue a purse is even more personal than a couch, but MIL loved it and still carries it.", "I agree he should get a say but he can\u2019t just make a unilateral decision", "Let\u2019s not forget that they are on the hook for $2000!  So basically $1000 from him and $1000 from wife while the other siblings/spouses are sharing $1000 in cost. I didn\u2019t read anywhere that stated how many other siblings/spouses there were other than the unemployed brother, but It already sounds like husband and wife are pulling far more of the weight/cost than anyone else. I would be a little tired of it as well if that was my wife\u2019s family.", "OP already agreed to covering it.  He\u2019s attaching strings after the fact.  It\u2019s Christmas and this just stirs up drama.  Let it go.", "This year and every year to come. This is a lesson to them. I wouldn\u2019t stir the pot either here. Usually I say otherwise but this one is one to let g, learn, and move on. Next time they are asked to cover a persons share the answer should be No.", "Oh, you mean just like OP did with his buddies...mmmm!", "But not embarrassed enough to put his name without moving a single finger. Some of you are wild.", "Right? And what if him being busy is actually that he doesn't have any gas money. Like, jeeze. Need more info.", "Weird. I missed the part where it was just OPs money. I would have thought it was also OPs wife\u2019s money - in which case it\u2019s a discussion. It\u2019s not OP telling the wife what to do with their money. They have to reach a decision together.", "Why not just say that though?", "Thank you!! Wish I could up vote you more!!!", "That or he was actually busy.  Everyone just assumes he's trash because he lost his job.  I might be on OPs side if the 'straw\" wasn't him not waiting by his phone to be able to move furniture, which can take an entire afternoon.", "I don't know.  I usually don't have time to clear an afternoon last minute so I really don't find it all that strange.", "I feel this. If someone\u2019s getting furniture from me, it\u2019ll be with my own money, which I don\u2019t currently have enough of for a brand new furniture set.", "She did. Her and her siblings decided that without discussing it with him.", "I read it as OP and wife were covering $2K and the siblings splitting the remaining $1K\u2014_plus_ OP and wife additionally covering BIL\u2019s share of the $1K because he can\u2019t afford the $333/$250/whatever.", "Agreed after he was told, not asked. First he was TOLD they would be covering the 2k. Then he was TOLD the wife agreed to cover BIL portion", "Maybe OP is a jackass, and BIL doesn't want him to know stuff about his life? Maybe OP was rude on the phone when expecting BIL to just show up with his truck the second OP called? Maybe BIL is depressed? Ashamed? So out of cash he can't afford petrol, or has to save his petrol for job interviews? Who knows, but a quick \"I'm sorry, but I can't/I'm busy\" should be enough. \n\n1. If OP only wanted to put the BIL's name on the card if he contributed that should have been discussed when they agreed on how to split the payment. \n\n2. What does he think he's gaining from this? \"Teaching the BIL a lesson\"? What lesson is that, exactly? \n\n3. OP is harming his wife's relationship with her siblings \n\n4. OP is harming his own relationship with probably all the in-laws \n\nAll by refusing to do what he agreed upon because someone didn't live up to expectations that were not communicated beforehand. \n\nYTA, OP", "Did we call him trash? Considering he didn\u2019t show even an ounce of interest in the gift at any point in the multi-weekend process, me thinks he doesn\u2019t need to be on the tag.", "Do you have a job?", "It\u2019s not like he was doing anything else.", "Hadn\u2019t they always planned to put BIL\u2019s name on the present? And he\u2019s the one who decided last minute that BIL didn\u2019t deserve it? \n\nAlso, maybe she and her siblings were thinking of their parents. Part of the gift may very well be that it came from all of them. But sure, let\u2019s strike BIL\u2019s name off the present and give them a heaping plate of family drama for Christmas. That\u2019s lovely.", "No, he said it was fine. He was happy to cover 2k. *Then* he decided that BiL didn't deserve the money and made it conditional, which was never discussed nor agreed upon. He is acting as if it is only his money and his conditions on which BIL gets his name on the gift.", "Because he's not blood.", "We know this how?", "He said it was fine after they decided and informed him of what was happening.", "He also probably felt like he didn't have a choice. She asked him about covering her brothers portion after it was decided that the siblings were buying the couch which wasn't discussed with him ahead of time. So he probably felt like she was going to do it regardless of how he felt.", "My bad. I reread it, and I was mistaken the first time. He should have said that the brother had to help. However, I know how frustrating that can be when ur covering someone and they can't help. He needs to cover this year since he agreed then next year tell wife they aren't going in with the siblings unless everyone contributes the fair amount at the same time.", "But he's the money and labor?!", "It's his money too so he should get a say"]}
