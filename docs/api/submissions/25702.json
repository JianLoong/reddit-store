Hubs is back at work and I am on maternity leave. Lately, my husband has been making me toast every morning as a little treat for me before he goes to work, and it's such a sweet gesture! (All I've been craving post-pregnancy is peanut butter on toast.)\r  \n\r  \n But the thing is...his toast...I can hardly call it that. He *barely* toasts it. The middle of the bread has only changed colour *very* slightly, and the edges are still perfectly soft. It's warmed bread, is what it is. Have you ever had slightly toasted toast? It's confusing. Be bread or be toast, but if you try to be both then you're neither. \n\nAnd while I do appreciate that he's making me a meal, and I know in my heart that it's the thought that counts, I  just want actually toasted toast back in my life. Especially as it's all I'm craving.\n\nI've mentioned it several times in the last week or so that I don't mind making my own toast, but he insists on making the toast for me before he goes to work. And I eat the barely toasted toast, because I don't like food waste if I can avoid it. But then because I've eaten the barely toastsed toast, it'd be too much food for me if I made myself a second piece of actual toast after he's left, so I don't get the toast taste I'm really craving.\r  \n\r  \nSo the other day when he was going to put the bread in the toaster, I asked him if he wouldn't mind leaving the bread in there just a little bit longer this time. He asked me if I didn't like his toast, and I said, \"No, I love that you've been making me toast! I just wouldn't mind it a little bit toastier.\" He got a bit annoyed and said that he gets up earlier to make me my toast every morning, and now he felt like I didn't appreciate his toast. I said I did appreciate his toast, but would appreciate it more if it were actually toast. Maybe I shouldn't have put it like that, because he told me I could make my own toast if I didn't think he was up to the task of toasting. I said I would, and I think this hurt him even more.\r  \n\r  \nI feel really bad that I hurt his feelings, but I feel like we've always asked for and given feedback on dishes we cook for one another previously so I thought it'd be okay if I just politely asked for my toast to be slightly more toasted. Should I have just kept eating the bad toast, and AITA for bringing it up with him?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1693220091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163ivyx/aita_for_judging_the_breakfast_my_husband_makes/", "score": 370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Disclaimer - I\u2019ve never birthed a child, nor am I a parent, so my take on this could be way off.\n\nYour husband\u2019s response isn\u2019t right. He shouldn\u2019t take this personally and turn it into a situation where your preference is offensive. HOWEVER - as it so often is in situations like this, I don\u2019t think this is about the toast at all. A lot of the burden of care falls on women in the months/early years after having a child. For example, provided he\u2019s a cis male, can\u2019t breastfeed, so if that\u2019s something you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s something that falls on the mother (obviously you can pump and he can feed that way but still, I know a lot of moms personally who use their reserves for a feeding break or nighttime feedings and still prefer to feed \u201cfrom the tap\u201d so to speak normally). You\u2019re home caring for the baby all day and he\u2019s at work. He may be feeling like he doesn\u2019t know how or where to support you best and wants to pick up things in other areas to make your life easier so that it helps to offset the burden on you and also makes him feel a little more involved in the process. This may be one way that he felt he could support you in a way that also supported your child. \n\nHe\u2019s being very childish in his response to you about the toast, completely agree. I think he\u2019s probably a little sensitive because he\u2019s not really sure how to best support you, the baby, and your overall family unit as you adjust to this huge life change. I would have a chat with him and see if this is the case, and if so, let him know directly the ways that you need support from him so he can a) be sure he\u2019s supporting you in the ways you need and b) feel involved in the process, even when he isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cinvolved.\u201d\n\nI could be totally wrong, but just my two cents here.", "YTA instead of appreciation, you're telling him how you'd do it.", "\nMaybe he wouldn't have been as upset if you mentioned it the *first* time he made the toast.

Hey OP maybe I'm not privy to conventional toasters, (we have a toaster oven as opposed to just a regular toaster) but why are the edges soft when it's my understanding that toasters leave line marks across the bread.

My wife likes hers bordering on 'crouton', but I didn't notice it until she said my preferences wasn't done well enough. We have a four-slice toaster, and I leave 'her' side set a minute or two longer than mine, and our marriage continues stronger every day. I wasn't TA for making toast 'my way' in the past, she was NTA for asking me to make hers differently, and I WBTA if I heard what she said and totally disregarded it for my own preference.\n\nTL;DR - NTA, OP.", "I would definitely want to know if I was making my husband anything and it wasn't his preference. I don't care if it's an entire meal, what's the point of doing something sweet if he doesn't even like it? And then getting mad about it when it's being clearly and kindly communicated?

If it's a toaster, can't you just increase the dial to a higher setting without him noticing, or would he notice and then turn it back down?

Things such as over easy eggs. He doesnt like them BUT he loves making them for me because he know I love them. Theyre also a pain in the ass to make. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say NTA. because if hes going to make you something just for you, he should be taking note of how you like it. I feel like if hes like this over toast, i cant imagine what he would say for something more serious or even in the bedroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I dont eat toast the same either. So he makes sure to make my toast the way I like it and then his own for himself..ie: I like my toast like your husband does, barely toasted but slightly, and my husband likes his def more toasty. \n\nI truly believe that you should be able to communicate likes wants and needs without being an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nYour husbands reaction is rather childish. You are allowed to like what you like.

You clearly appreciate his effort and all you're asking for is for your toast to be more well done.", "NTA -mind you, he's not stupid, he'll have immediately realised that you've been disliking his toast for a while now. He's tired and he's grouchy and lashed out a bit, feeling ashamed that his gesture has been a hindrance rather than a favour. I think if you had settled this a bit earlier you might have helped yourself out here.\n\nBut not your fault and he's being the asshole here. Tempted to say NAH but it's toast. Everyone has a different preference, just turn up the setting and go about your day.", "NTA. If people do something nice for you, it should be the way you like it and you should be allowed to politly tell them that. Maybe not when they see you once a year and gift you something that is not your favorite but in this case he should be wanting to do it for you, not for the gesture and be able to react as an adult about your preferences.

Seeing that it was only a month ago that means romance is not in the picture (doctors saying wait 6 weeks).  He is probably feeling a little disconnected and the toast might be his way of trying to feel involved.  You are bonding with your bundle of joy while he is out of the house missing all that.  \n\nI recommend trying to find a way to make him feel included (something beyond feedings and diaper changes).  It might just do the trick to ease his mind.", "Yes", "NTA.  bUt wOmEN aRe eMOtIoNL!", "How is he screwing up toast? Does your toaster not have a specific setting that you just use whenever you make toast?

NTA.", "NTA. My father was like this.  If you gently told him something like this about his cooking, he\u2019d honestly pout, then proceed to make the food the EXACT same way and set it in front of you.  Daring you to upset him again.  No one called him on it ever.  It\u2019s control and manipulation and should not be tolerated.  Good luck.", "NTA\nDon't eat things you don't like. He can't know if you don't say anything.

If you can't tell your husband that the flaccid toast needs more toasting then what happens when it's a more egregious issue?", "NTA.

It is such a simple fix and it doesn't change anything at the end of the day (except yummier toast)", "NTA your husband is being very dramatic about toast.\nMy husband works overnights so I pack his dinner every day. I don't get mad when he asks me to switch it up or even add more mayo or something. It's a simple fix to something I'm already doing.", "NTA You made a very reasonable request in a seemingly polite way and he reacted very strangely. Leaving the toast in the toaster for a little while longer does nothing to inconvenience him. Maybe he\u2019s stressed or sleep deprived from the new baby and is actually irrationally, because getting that offended by a toast request is not normal.", "Definitely NTA. \nIt's literally just toast, it takes zero effort to *leave it in the toaster a bit longer* and making you feel bad about it is a completely immature reaction IMO.", "NTA, and yes - it is APPROPRIATE for a husband and wife to share feedback on their needs/wants and to problem-solve together.\n\nYour husband reminds me of an aunt I have. She will decide to make something for you, but she wants to feel that she made it this 'special, unique' way that only she can do. So it doesn't matter what ingredients your prefer in the dish or whether you actually even like the dish; aunt is so happy and proud of how she did this really wonderful thing 'for you'.\n\nThey are not thinking about you that much. They are reveling in how good they feel about themselves.\n\nYour husband \"gets up early\" to barely warm/toast the bread for you. Hmm. How many seconds early does he wake up?\n\nMy husband likes to make toast for some of our breakfasts, but I hate cold toast. He will offer to make me some, and I will thank him but say I want to wait till I'm ready to sit down. (I'm usually the last one to sit down.) He understands and just gets the toast for him and the kids. It's not that hard.\n\nIt's also not a matter of you asking him to carefully make you French toast to your specifications. You are just asking for the toast to be toasted a bit more or for him to let you make it for yourself. Ask him why he is so reluctant to choose either of those easy options that would make you much happier? Ask him he just can't hear that you DO appreciate his desire to make you toast, and instead only hears that his efforts are not perfect enough for you. Maybe he's putting extra pressure on himself to be his idea of a great husband/daddy (with the new baby), and can't see the forest for the trees.", "Super weird.

He flipped out as he did because he's embarrassed, as a new father, exhausted (as is she), and annoyed that she didn't tell him how she preferred her toast to be prepared (as any reasonable person would be).\n\nIf she learned to use her mouth and speak as an adult beforehand, he wouldn't be rightfully annoyed about being called on the carpet for a preference he didn't know she had, and she wouldn't have had to spend days eating toast she doesn't prefer. \\[She's also exhausted, for obvious reasons, so I understand why her communication skills are lacking right now, too.\\]\n\nCommunication is key to a long-term relationship. Not only do closed mouths not get fed, the bodies to which they belong don't get satisfied, either. While OP's husband should be more-reasonable in his response, I can't blame him for feeling a certain way, especially given that, like OP, he's exhausted from helping to care for the household and child while also working and she didn't tell him about her dissatisfaction with his toast until now.\n\nOP should extend to him some grace in light of his exhaustion. He, in turn, should do the same. Both should sit down and figure out how to communicate better, and if necessary, seek some counseling to help out on this front. As I can tell you after 15 years of marriage, life becomes harder the longer you are married; between aging parents, growing children and other life issues, communication focused on solving problems and (for the most part) not blaming each other becomes crucial.\n\nUltimately, ESH. I hope OP and her husband figure out how to communicate better and more-productively.\n\nBTW: There's no one good way to prepare toast. Just the way each of us prefers.

OVER toast.   \n\n\nDIVORCE him immediately for not making toast correctly...... /s", "HUGE red flag, I think _the divorce card_ is justified to play here.\n\n/s\n\nEdit: This was firstly released without _s/_", "This is a very kind script to use. I hope OP sees it.", "Now you have me wondering... I was assuming the toast was really light because that's how he likes to eat it and he can't imagine people would want it any other way. Now I'm contemplating the possibility that it's really light because that takes the least amount of time.", "I mean, after all, he's basically feeding her *raw toast*.", ">Don\u2019t feel bad about it. He\u2019s making barely toasted bread, which is kind of gross.\n\nJust throw his warm, peanut butter covered bread away and make a proper peanut covered TOAST (after hubby leaves for work).  You are not wasting food, HE IS by not making actually making toast.  But, you're wasting your moment by eating something unappealing.  If you can ever taking some ME time, its one month post-partum.\n\nPlease, please take a beat to think of yourself and have some ME time. Post-partum depression is very real.  If discreetly destroying a crappy breakfast in favor of one you crave makes you happy, it's the smart and economic move ($1 of bread versus $500 therapy).  \n\nI am also concerned that if the two of you cannot talk about toast you have serious red flags.  In the next twenty five years you both have a lot of much more serious conversations ahead of you.  Figure out how to be adults.", "The baby is all for him??? She didn\u2019t want it??? where does op say that their partner was the one who wanted the baby and the baby is for the partner and not an extension of their family that they BOTH wanted and desired and created TOGETHER to love and raise TOGETHER??", "He's making her peanut butter toast, so it can't go back in once it's made.", "If he reacts like that to an extremely reasonable request no wonder she did not tell him. He cleary can't take the slightest criticism. Heck, it's not even a criticism at this point, just a request.", "She sort of went about it in a weird way. Like she tiptoed around it for weeks. Just straight say I like it more burnt in day 1 or 2. Or just go change the dial and leave it at your desired number. \nI do think her husband reacted oddly but really post pregnancy has everyone in a weird spot. \n\nEveryone in my life knows I like overcooked hotdogs on a grill and that\u2019s because I let them all know anytime someone is grilling.", "She literally offered to do it herself lmao", "I think we found the husband.", "Right?! I was torn between shaking my head and laughing when I got to that line.", "Yeah, the constant reassurance to us that he's a great guy and a wonderful husband was my first red flag.", "And it's TOAST! He's not making her a souffle every morning. How much earlier does he have to get up to put some bread in a toaster?!", "if he was really sweet and nice then he wouldnt mind taking feedback like toasting it for a little longer to better help the person hes doing it for.", "Yes, divorce him immediately. That fucker HOW DARE HE! HE MUST BE CHEATING TOO!\n\nOr, maybe, the guy also just had a baby 1 month ago, and it's all overwhelming. And he's being too sensitive right now, which is only human.", "Oh for crying out loud. He's emotionally exhausted from a baby and you're saying divorce? Ridiculous.", "Maybe she tiptoed around forever because she was dreading this reaction, like this is how he commonly reacts to criticism. I\u2019ve had partners like this, and you get conditioned to pick your battles very quickly. It\u2019s not healthy", "Then I'm TA for not reading fully", "You think wrong. I am not shocked by this.", "Agreed.", "Ya...I was totally laughing at this. NOW he has to get up 30 to 45 seconds earlier!!! \n\nTBH, just sounds like two very tired people being sensitive. It's possible that hubby is always this way, but it shouldn't be a big deal that one person likes their toast more toasted and if hubby really does want to do something nice, then it does need to be edible. Intent is important, but so is communication. He shouldn't be shutting down conversation cuz he's butt hurt that he likes different toast.", "Forgot to put the /s", "We are in the divorce/breakup/no contact sub.", "Except she ended her post with how they normally do give each other feedback on each other food dishes and sounds like it\u2019s never been an issue before or there wouldn\u2019t be this post. Either way it\u2019s really not a big issue just better communication earlier might have been better.", "because you're being a condescending, sexist AH."]}
