Hubs is back at work and I am on maternity leave. Lately, my husband has been making me toast every morning as a little treat for me before he goes to work, and it's such a sweet gesture! (All I've been craving post-pregnancy is peanut butter on toast.)\r  \n\r  \n But the thing is...his toast...I can hardly call it that. He *barely* toasts it. The middle of the bread has only changed colour *very* slightly, and the edges are still perfectly soft. It's warmed bread, is what it is. Have you ever had slightly toasted toast? It's confusing. Be bread or be toast, but if you try to be both then you're neither. \n\nAnd while I do appreciate that he's making me a meal, and I know in my heart that it's the thought that counts, I  just want actually toasted toast back in my life. Especially as it's all I'm craving.\n\nI've mentioned it several times in the last week or so that I don't mind making my own toast, but he insists on making the toast for me before he goes to work. And I eat the barely toasted toast, because I don't like food waste if I can avoid it. But then because I've eaten the barely toastsed toast, it'd be too much food for me if I made myself a second piece of actual toast after he's left, so I don't get the toast taste I'm really craving.\r  \n\r  \nSo the other day when he was going to put the bread in the toaster, I asked him if he wouldn't mind leaving the bread in there just a little bit longer this time. He asked me if I didn't like his toast, and I said, \"No, I love that you've been making me toast! I just wouldn't mind it a little bit toastier.\" He got a bit annoyed and said that he gets up earlier to make me my toast every morning, and now he felt like I didn't appreciate his toast. I said I did appreciate his toast, but would appreciate it more if it were actually toast. Maybe I shouldn't have put it like that, because he told me I could make my own toast if I didn't think he was up to the task of toasting. I said I would, and I think this hurt him even more.\r  \n\r  \nI feel really bad that I hurt his feelings, but I feel like we've always asked for and given feedback on dishes we cook for one another previously so I thought it'd be okay if I just politely asked for my toast to be slightly more toasted. Should I have just kept eating the bad toast, and AITA for bringing it up with him?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1693220091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163ivyx/aita_for_judging_the_breakfast_my_husband_makes/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Disclaimer - I\u2019ve never birthed a child, nor am I a parent, so my take on this could be way off.\n\nYour husband\u2019s response isn\u2019t right. He shouldn\u2019t take this personally and turn it into a situation where your preference is offensive. HOWEVER - as it so often is in situations like this, I don\u2019t think this is about the toast at all. A lot of the burden of care falls on women in the months/early years after having a child. For example, provided he\u2019s a cis male, can\u2019t breastfeed, so if that\u2019s something you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s something that falls on the mother (obviously you can pump and he can feed that way but still, I know a lot of moms personally who use their reserves for a feeding break or nighttime feedings and still prefer to feed \u201cfrom the tap\u201d so to speak normally). You\u2019re home caring for the baby all day and he\u2019s at work. He may be feeling like he doesn\u2019t know how or where to support you best and wants to pick up things in other areas to make your life easier so that it helps to offset the burden on you and also makes him feel a little more involved in the process. This may be one way that he felt he could support you in a way that also supported your child. \n\nHe\u2019s being very childish in his response to you about the toast, completely agree. I think he\u2019s probably a little sensitive because he\u2019s not really sure how to best support you, the baby, and your overall family unit as you adjust to this huge life change. I would have a chat with him and see if this is the case, and if so, let him know directly the ways that you need support from him so he can a) be sure he\u2019s supporting you in the ways you need and b) feel involved in the process, even when he isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cinvolved.\u201d\n\nI could be totally wrong, but just my two cents here.", "YTA instead of appreciation, you're telling him how you'd do it.", "\nMaybe he wouldn't have been as upset if you mentioned it the *first* time he made the toast.
