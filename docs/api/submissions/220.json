I currently  work on a horse farm as a working student. I get paid $12/hr with free riding lessons and I get paid under the table. I love my job and though it's hard work, it's enjoyable and something that works well for me because I have ADHD.\nDespite how much I love my job, my parents think it's a waste because the state doesn't recognize me as being employed, therfore my dad says I don't have a real job and I need to get one.  This started after I dropped out of college due to doing poorly in it. I wish I could go back to school as I aim to be a livestock vet, but due to untreated(Only in the past month have I started treatment) ADHD and the pandemic, I'm mentally unable to do it at the moment. My parents have been pressuring me since I started doing bad in college to just try harder and do more classes even when I'm doing my best. My parents are constantly  making off hand comments  in reply to things I say. For example, I may express interest  in a horse related topic and my mom may reply 'Or  you could be spending your type applying to college' and my dad would chip in 'Or apply and get a real job'.. this has been going on for MONTHS.\n\nAt the beginning  of September  we got into a big argument  where I tried to explain my side and how I mentally cannot handle going to college right now even though it would be my dream. How I love my job and even if I get paid less, the people are amazing, It's a job I know I can handle, and I gain valuable  experience  through riding other people's horses outside my own. I refused to listen to their advice and because of it, I was told that I was \"Looking for a roommate situation\" and not to be a part or this family, and thus I would be required to pay rent.\n  \n  Tomorrow  marks month 2 of paying  rent, and up until Yesterday, I thought I was justified with my decision to stay with the job I have until my family was hanging out with family friends. They were asking me about  my future  plans, and my mom brought up that they want me to get a real job. The family friends asked me multiple  questions about why I don't want to get the job my parents  want me to get, and what makes me think my current  job is better. By the end of the conversation, though they didn't outright say it they made it very clear they sided with my parents. \n\nSo now I'm wondering if I should just listen to my parents and get a real job, and If I'm being a jerk for not listening to their advice. I understand that they want what's best for me, and if I get a real job I'll get paid more, but I'm very happy with where I am in life even if it isn't what I had originally wanted. I will have a different job eventually, as soon as I go back to college, but right now I don't feel the need to. I make enough money to pay for my phone, car, gas, and now rent plus  have been putting money away into savings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667267483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yivih4/aita_for_refusing_to_get_a_real_job/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This may be why they are pushing you to get a better paying job or go back to school. Hence the rent requirement. Are you in the US? I ask because you can stay on your parent\u2019s insurance until you turn 26. After, that you will need a job that provides this for you. This is especially important since you have ADHD and will need to see a mental health specialist regularly. I don\u2019t think you are an ah for wanting to keep doing something you enjoy. I can definitely understand where your parents are coming from, as well. NAH", "Just saying, it would be smart to get a job that's not under the table so you can start paying into social security and a 401k.", "Info: are you completely financial stabile", "I don't understand how this isn't a real job. I currently live in Texas and they have absolutely crap minimum wage. A friend of mine makes a base of 3$ an hour and relies on tips as a server. I made 10$ an hour at a place that I hated but it was the best paying thing I could find.\n\n12$ is what I made minimum in Oregon where I'm from and boy I took it for granted. Plus I paid taxes on that, unlike your being paid utt. So you are making more than  most people your age. Plus getting relevant experience for later.\n\nYou are paying rent, you are paying your own way on things...etc. I don't get most of these comments agreeing with your parents.\n\nI think your parents are just mad you aren't in college still. They need to get over that if they agreed to letting you move back in.\n\nOh also cut it out with the herbal stuff for ADHD, yes side effects from meds exist but it is worth it to function. CBT and such also help, pills alone fix nothing. (This coming from someone who had worked on their own issues for almost my whole life while taking meds) If you take them and get side effects worse than the help they give you try something different. I will never understand people being so scared of side effects that may not even happen to you. Some people I know never experience them, maybe you'll be lucky. If not you get off it and try one of the many others.\n\nNTA sounds like you and your parents need to have more serious convos about why they think this isn't a real job and what they expect. At 19 you are young and many people your age make way less.", "The term arrested development is coming to mind. It\u2019s totally understandable that you love your job, but you\u2019re an adult now and need to be taking steps to grow up and move forward. \n\nHave you considered that your parents don\u2019t want their adult child being a roommate for an indefinite period of time? I can see how that can be frustrating for them.\n\nSoft YTA. Follow your passion, but do it in a way that doesn\u2019t burden others", "Hmm.. I think I would just say ESH. It\u2019s a little confusing because you say you make $12/hour (while committing tax fraud) but you have enough money to pay for therapy, medicine, car, phone, gas, rent, AND saving. Kinda don\u2019t see how that is possible without the rent you are paying basically being a completely symbolic amount. Sounds like you are still getting significant support from your parents and such support -always- comes with string. If they feel like you aren\u2019t fulfilling your end of the bargain by at least making an effort to move forward with your life (taking some classes, getting a better paid job, etc) then it\u2019s reasonable that they are unhappy.\n\nOf course, if you are actually struggling and it\u2019s apparent to them and they don\u2019t care to help with it, then they are also TA. Sounds like their choice to allow you to be homeschooled is causing a lot of your issues failing to adapt to rigid structure and deadlines, so that is at least partly on them.\n\nSeems like you need to find a compromise. Perhaps you can just take a couple classes? Don\u2019t put yourself under a full load that you can\u2019t handle, but try a couple classes until you learn to manage your time better. You do have to be dedicated to improving though\u2026 especially if you really want to be a vet.", "NAH.  OP is happy with the current situation,  but does not appear to have a long term plan.

Or maybe you could get a job at a vet or animal shelter for a year while you prepare yourself for college.", "As a fellow lady with ADHD... a soft ESH.\n\nFrom what you've said, your parents sound like they don't understand ADHD very well and aren't making an effort to get it. You can't just will your ADHD away, and it's not something you can just push through. They also aren't acknowledging that you actually have a pretty cool job for someone your age! Good for you.\n\nOn the other hand, you're an adult now, and you know you have ADHD which means that you have everything you need to get proper treatment and make progress on your career goals. You've said in another comment that you're using herbal therapies, and I'm sorry if this sounds insensitive, but that's not real treatment.\n\nDelaying treatment **will** delay your education, your career progression, and your ability to be self-sufficient and have a secure future. This **will** become a stressor for your loved ones as well as yourself. \"I will have a different job eventually\" is a classic ADHD dream. \"Eventually\" has a tendency to never arrive.\n\nI say this as someone who made this mistake for far too long.\n\nPlease talk to a doctor or psychiatrist and start treatment.

FWIW, I also wish you the best, and want you to achieve the dreams that you've talked about here.", "Currently testing an herbal mix based on my research and a company that does similar treatments who didn't ever get back to me. It seems to be helping a little bit so far bit not as much as I would like so I'm giving it another few weeks before I try medication. I've heard more bad things about ADHD  medication than I have good things so I am very hesitant to try them.\n\nI don't feel that I'm currently  able to go to college as I failed a full 3 semesters of college. First semester when the pandemic  hit and everything was online. Second semester  when we came back to school, but despite  me trying as hard as I could, I just couldn't keep up. I told my parents I wanted to try to stop going for a semester. They told me no(they are not paying for my college. I had a scholarship that I lost after the 1st failed semester, and since then have been paying for my own classes) and that I had to keep going. So I took one class for my 3rd semester  and still failed so I decided to take a gap year. I was homeschooled thrpugh highschool and so was able to make my own schedule, do my schoolwork how and when I wanted to.  In college, I struggled to  keep up  with deadlines, forgotten homework, and when I did some of my best, highest graded work, 99% of the time I did it the day that it was due and barely bothered to even  proof read it. \nAfter failed semester three I began therapy.", "I am.  I have been paying for both my therapy and treatment since I began therapy. We are trying alternatives before I go onto medication,  and if I do start on meds  I will also be paying for those."]}
