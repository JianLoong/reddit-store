After one year of our break-up I had a ONS with a friend who had a crush on me for years and after realising I was pregnant we stayed together. We moved together and in another city because of our jobs. After the birth of our daughter we married. I couldn\u2019t be happier with my husband. We are now together for nearly 5 years and happier than ever. \nI didn\u2019t know if my ex knows that I became a mother. Since I moved away while being pregnant I missed a lot of birthdays of our mutual friends and he didn\u2019t follow me on social media. Now is the wedding from one of our mutual friends and I was happy about the invite. But then I got a message from another one of our friends. He told me that nobody told my ex that I became a mother and married and that he didn\u2019t seriously dated anybody else after the break-up. He is successful in his job and concentrates on that but his friends are worried that he is lonely. They requested that I come without my child (we actually had this planed before so my husband and me have enough time to reconnect and my mother-in-law would be so happy to have our daughter overnight) and don\u2019t mention my husband. I disagreed. Before I asked the bride if she wanted me not to come and told her the request from our other friends. She told me that I should definitely come and that she doesn\u2019t see any problem with it. \n\nWhen we arrived for the wedding we realized that we were seated next to my ex. I found that strange. I went quietly to the bride and told her that would probably be not the best idea but she brushed it off. My ex barely talked to me but drank a lot. My husband chatted with another person from our table and mentioned our daughter (after 2 hours sitting at the table). My ex broke loose - he made a big scene and accused me of lying to him about not wanting children. It was so embarrassing and ultimately my husband and I left while my ex got carried aways by other guest. Since then I got calls from mutual friends calling ME the asshole because I rubbed my luck under my ex noses. I\u2019m a little bit confused.

Nope.", "NTA- oh please. They sat you next to your ex on purpose. There is NO way they didn't know he wouldnt  behave that way when drinking.  Its on HIM for acting that way not you. You even asked to be moved.  Total set up by your so called friends thinking they could get you two back together.", "NTA. It's been over half a decade, and it's not your fault how life turned out. None of us predicts who we will be in a year's time with complete accuracy. What, you were supposed to avoid marrying or having kids just because you didn't want that with your ex whom you don't even see or speak to anymore? Ridiculous.\n\nThe fact your ex blew up after that long, in a public venue, says you dodged a bullet. His misery is not your responsibility.\n\nAnd you *warned* the bride. All of these mutual friends had every chance to *tell* your ex beforehand if they were so concerned, and that's what would have made sense - to casually mention it so he wouldn't be surprised - and as *his* friends that's appropriate coming from them, not you, a now virtual stranger. It's not on you to contact someone you haven't spoken to for 6 years to \"explain yourself\", and it's not your fault ex reacted volatilely like some inebriated toddler who feels he's owed something. \n\nIf anyone else gives you grief, simply turn it around and ask them why they didn't prevent the issue by being honest with him and consoling him. What responsibility of it was yours?\n\nI'm glad you're happy with your new life!", "NTA\n\nOnce you broke up it became none of his business if you want children/marriage.\n\nSounds like you dodged a bullet with a guy who can't even control himself at someone's wedding", "You're NTA. You broke up 6 years ago, for goodness sakes. It's not your fault he hasn't moved on with his life. It's also not your fault someone who likes to create friction and drama seated you next to each other.", "NTA\n\nYour ex sounds like a piece of work lol.\n\nThe bride really shouldn't have had you sat beside your damn ex, that was stupid. \n\nBut this is a problem of your ex, not you or your husband. Also those friends of yours asking you not to mention your husband are AH's. Good on you for bringing your husband.", "NTA.  But your ex and the bride sure are.  Why does the bride have to sit you next to your ex?  That is like, bad Hollywood movie dumb. If she knew it was a possibility that he would be upset at you being a mom, then she should know enough not to sit him at the same table.  How is this supposed to be fun for you if you are going to have to have awkward small talk all night?  \n\nAnd then she isn't willing to listen to how the topic came up, and just assumes you rubbed it in his face?  What is going on with her and your friends?  Are they in high school?  Cause this is some immature nonsense they want to rope you into.\n\nAnd finally: why have they been keeping this information from him this whole time?  They all kind of suck.", "NTA, all I can think is you dodged a bullet with your ex.", "I don\u2019t have children but I find it hard to believe that the subject of one\u2019s toddler would not inevitably come up during a wedding reception dinner. Bride knew this. NTA", "You have some fucking horrible \u201cfriends\u201d damn my friends would have had my back and told my petty ex to fuck off. Yeah it sucks for him but life is like a river flowing and you never know where it goes / where you end up.", "NTA if your friends thought he\u2019s not over you and that he would be upset finding out you have a child then should not have sat you and your husband next to him risking him finding out after drinking. They should also have told him the truth before the wedding. They created the situation and you advised it was a bad idea. He might be upset you had a baby after saying you didn\u2019t want one yet but things happen and people change their minds, he should have moved on by now.", "NTA, you did what you could. Your ex is obviously TA here. Sucks that the bride is seemingly not listening to you, but maybe she's heard the story putting you in a shitty light from a bunch of people, compared to just you telling her the truth. Either way, it'll probably blow over in time.", "NTA.\n\nYou: \"This isn't wise!\"\n\nThem: \"It'll be fine!\"\n\n\\[life\\]\n\nThem: \"It's your fault for lighting the stack of dynamite we sat next to you and an already burning fire mere centimeters away from the fuse and getting closer!\"\n\nSeriously, are the bride and groom even your friends? They sat you in a situation where you were 99% sure some sort of a scene would happen. They can't act all surprised about it now, AFTER YOU TRIED TO WARN THEM and they didn't do anything about it. \n\nIt isn't reasonable in the entire time that your babysitter wouldn't call, or someone would come by to ask about your daughter, or hell, even see a picture of your daughter on the lock or home screen on either person's phone.", "NTA\n\nyou've been broken up for 5 years, did he not expect that you've moved on at all?? He's childish and bitter, and definitely the asshole here", "NTA. Your ex is though, he shouldn\u2019t have put a timescale on you getting married and having kids, then at the wedding he should not have said anything to you. You tried to warn the bride and she didn\u2019t take your concerns seriously. You shouldn\u2019t have to hide your life for anyone.", "Nta, \nThings change whatever  it happen. You told the bride about what would happen but push it off (which I understand , it's the wedding a little late to change the seating maybe) but your friends and bride are why should you not talk about your life when knowing somebody going to answer.\n\nYour friends are AH they should been said something to your ex because ot seem like he still talk about you. Now I'm nkt saying it easy to get over a long term relationship  but come on", "NTA.  Pandering to your jerk ex is not on the table.   Your EX had a fit. This is not your fault in any way and not mentioning your life (husband, child) etc is ridiculous. Sounds like the bride is an AH too.", "NTA At all in this case. You moved on, he didn't. That's on him, not you. And I'm appalled that common friends you had (including the bride) actually sided with him, when he was a drunken mess.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou didn't make a scene, your ex did.", "NTA, you tried everything you could", "NTA. Those so-called mutual friends are not your friends and I think you\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get ties down with that obsessive ex.", "ESH.  He was wrong to create a scene and that is on him.

She says they didn't break up over a falling out but a difference in wants/needs at that time.  There is no reason to treat him so crudely.

A simple, \"Hey, I don't want you to find out another way, but after we broke up, I had a one night stand that resulted in a pregnancy and eventually married the person.  We were planning on going to x & y's wedding and I know you were invited too\" is not that hard to do.  This is the same thing as if you are 8 months pregnant and attending a wedding with people who knew you well, but do not know you are pregnant, the polite thing to do is notify in advance in reduce any distraction or drama at the wedding.  The bride had no reason to assume these people couldn't be reasonable for one day.  The way to do that is advanced notice.  Then he could make an informed choice to not go if he did not want to see her.  She also should have asked before the wedding that, if possible, she be seated at a different table than her ex.

Bride and her friends were trying to break up your marriage and get you back with your ex.  That's scummy enough by itself, especially when your husband was invited also, but to expect you and your husband not to answer truthfully when asked if you had children was totally unrealistic.  Your ex ruined the wedding and his friends helped him. Tell the bride she has only herself to blame for seating you next to him.", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown man. You are not responsible for managing his emotions or behavior, and no one should have ever asked you to try. You haven\u2019t seen the dude in years. They all have.
