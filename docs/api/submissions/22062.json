I never cheated on him. I never did anything of the sort. But the final straw was when he demanded a DNA test. I told him if he doesn't trust me and takes the test, then I will file for divorce.

I'm torn on this since she already knows something isn't right. The not knowing why might be just as bad as knowing why. She's not 8 anymore and sooner or later she will find out the truth.

However, she is directly affected in this situation, and she is confused and upset so you can't really skirt the issue. \n\nShe is likely enjoying this new side to her dad, and she's insecure as to whether it's going to last.  It sounds like she's afraid that she had done something in the past to deserve his treatment and that she's going to do something to lose the relationship she has with him now.  It's just not fair to leave her in that kind of mindset.\n\nShe knows there's something off here and you need to make it clear to her that it isn't about anything she's done or doing.

But it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s curious & had noticed that her dad didn\u2019t particularly like or care for her in her early formative years. On the other hand if she finds out later she could be mad at both of you or even blame herself for the divorce. You also don\u2019t want your ex to try to change the narrative. My advice would be to speak with a child therapist & see what they think would be the best & regardless of your choice Julie should be put into counseling because she obviously has feelings of neglect from her dad. \n\nThere truly isn\u2019t a right or wrong answer", "YWBTA\nI would not lie -  but just say it feels inappropriate to share right now.

I would simply say, \"you have the most in common with your dad, it's nice you can bond over sports\"\n\nEnd of discussion.  \n\nHe's not using her or manipulating her by taking a interest in her.

That's already bad and your ex will need to fix that and apologize. \n\nHowever you telling her the truth is a different story. You can't know every outcome so get advice as to how this might impact her. Ultimately it doesn't matter as much whether her relationship to a bad father is ruined or not compared to how this impacts her own well-being. I am not an expect so can't say if it is generally better for her to know now or not so seek that advice.\n\nShe does deserve the truth eventually but it might have to come from the person who caused the problems to begin with.

She knows her dad didn't treat her the same as her siblings...and now he is being loving towards her. But she doesn't trust it. \n\nThis totally sucks.    If he had changed...then HE should tell her....\"honey, I made a mistake. I blamed you but it was my fault.

My heart is breaking contemplating all of this.", "YTA\n\n**This is not information that is helpful to Julie in any way. Julie is not your therapist.

Children take the negative feelings assigned towards the other parent or by the other parent in divorce situation and apply them to themselves. They internalize all that hate. So she's not going to hear, \"Oh, okay. There's nothing wrong with me. Daddy's just an AH. NOW I get it!\" What she's going to hear is that her daddy wanted sibling #1 and sibling #2 but detested her so much that he hated her before she was ever born. She's going to internalize that there is something wrong with her because her own father couldn't love her, and has never loved her. And you explaining it more and validating it more and making it all about infertility and perceived infidelity is not going to make it all magically okay. It's just going to make it all worse.\n\nDon't go there. What you need to do is keep being an amazing positive mom and be there for your daughter. When she's much, much older (adult and only if she asks!) you can tell her, non-specifically, that your marriage started having problems before she was born and it had nothing to do with her.

However he is rebuilding the relationship and it is kind of irrelevant why.  She is benefitting from it.  \n\nYou can however say you don't know (which you 100 percent do not know you only suspect) why the relationship changed and encourage her to talk to her father.  This is a skill set she can use as an adult if she does attempt it.  We spend so much of our time wondering and making assumptions and questioning ourselves when we could go ask the source.

He would always put time and effort into getting our 2 other kids a thoughtful gift and would always give Julie a gift card. The monetary value would always be near/the same, but the process of getting the gifts were always lackluster when it came to Julie.

If Julie thinks that her father used to neglect her and she has now noticed, as you have, that he doesn't neglect her anymore, then she should talk to him about it.

Since she is confused about her father's behavior toward her, therapy also seems like a good idea.", "I was her age when I found out some truths about my father from my mother in response to my questions about my lack of relationship with him (unless it was convenient). It helped me a lot with understanding it was his issue and not mine. I appreciated my mom for not lying to protect him.", "well unless the mother treats the kid as an unwanted child and they ask about that...

Even if you tell her she didn't do anything, even if *he* tells her she didn't do anything, he has clearly treated her very differently, and as a kid/teen it's easy to internalize that stuff and assume that it's your fault somehow. Telling her the truth puts the blame squarely where it belongs - on his shoulders. \n\nI understand not wanting to shit-talk the other parent, but it's not shit-talking if it's the (carefully, tactfully stated) truth. I'm not going to pretend that it won't damage her relationship with her father, but she already knows something is \"off\". \n\nShe'll also likely figure out at least half of the reason on her own (kids aren't stupid) and then she's going to feel like if she messes up/isn't good enough at sports, dad will go back to treating her poorly.

OR tell her it is extremely complicated and you aren't comfortable talking about it with her yet. She is your daughter. You should be able to feel whether or not she can handle the truth. Because it happened, it's her life. She will inevitably find out.

What she deserves is for her concerns not to be brushed off or dismissed completely.", "Saying she'll have answers and jer knowing the truth are the same thing. \n\nWhich is why I'm asking can you actually give a positive thing out of this?", "that breaks my heart.  so basically he made it obvious he didnt treat or show care like the siblings.   then in my heart i think becuase she is smart and seeing she had tears means she thought alot and not said anything wondering what she did that he didnt love her.  she deserves to hear it.", "She's 12. There's no impasse. You'd be a irresponsible parent to discuss this with a twelve year old. Inexcusable.", "She\u2019s too young to process that information at a healthy level. She\u2019ll figure it out as an adult.", "This is not an \"impasse\" that leads to good places for her, is the thing.\n\nShe knows there is something wrong with her relationship with her day. She knows he treats her siblings better than her. This is not news.\n\nThe information you are going to provide is not going to do anything to make Julie feel better. Her knowing that her dad was upset you couldn't get pregnant with her and deeply resented her.... helps how? Her knowing that her dad believed she wasn't his kid and forced you to get a pregnancy test and said she didn't look like she was his, and thought her sister did look like she was his... helps how? Her knowing that her dad accused you of infidelity because she didn't look like him, and that you later divorced over it... helps how? \n\nYou are looking at this as a 45 year old adult. You have forgotten what it is like to think like a 12 year old child. It's been too long. Children internalize negative emotions they associate with their parents. It's why it's so important not to badmouth the other parent in a divorce. They don't hear \"your dad is an ass, but you're nothing like him.\" They hear, he's horrible and he is part of me so I am horrible too.\"\n\nAll these little pieces of information that she is too young to have will be very damaging to her. Personally I don't think she ever needs to have them. I think you need to have her in therapy and need to have that child therapist talking to her on a weekly basis about her poor relationship with her jerk of a father. And you should be reiterating how you got divorced because the marriage had serious problems that were between the two of you. But she doesn't need adult details. She is not your girlfriend, priest or therapist. She is TWELVE.", "Or maybe she realizes that he would dump julie once she stops playing soccer. How is op the bad one here,  i don't understand!! Julie knows something is not right, since her dad ignored her for 12 years.", "I hate the fact that he mistreated our daughter for 12 years. I hate the fact that if she didn't play soccer, he still wouldn't be interested in her.

I just hate his actions and his treatment of our daughter.", "Or maybe she is worried because julie knows her dad would dump her again. He is the bad guy here, who ignored his kid for 12 years and now plays the loving father part only because she plays a sport. What would happen when she stops playing??", "Like if he says, \"I've always loved you the same\"?", "She is making assumptions.  \n\nShe has no idea why she just believes something which may be correct but it is also skewed because she is a woman scorned.  \n\nIf it does happen she picks her daughter up, brushes her off and teaches her that her value is not based on another person's opinion of her.  \n\nAs much as you want to protect your children giving them information about other peoples relationships with them is not going to help them when you yourself are emotionally charged. \n\nWhat happens if she tells her this stuff and she walks up to her dad and says mom said xy and z.  Now remember mom doesn't actually know so he can provide proof of some of what she is saying is wrong because she did NOT  know.  Now everything her mom has told her is wrong.

Sorry to be harsh,  but this is important. I divorced a diagnosed Narcissist who said loads of negative crap about our three kids. Including that he never loved them, never bonded with them. I was a SAHM and they adored me and feared him, and I guess he projected his hatred of me onto them. Or maybe he really was that upset that they were only middling at soccer. I never told them any of it. They\u2019re in their 20s now, and he\u2019s a bit better, they have relationships with him, he\u2019s glad he has kids and is helping pay for grad school. Kids really hate being abandoned (physically or emotionally) by a parent and it turns out that pain is even more painful than dealing with uncomfortable relationships. My kids want a dad more than they want to stay mad about how he was when they were young. Because he was awful, trust me. But even I can feel glad they have relationships with him because I see how much it has helped them stabilized.", "Never involve the kids in your drama, asshole.", "YWBTA.\n\nYour child is 12. If soccer is the thing that allows her to finally bond with her father, then so be it. Maybe he'll wise up, build a better relationship with her, and some of the damage he did can start to be repaired.\n\nWhat difference does it make why this is happening? Why does she \"need\" to know? What would it benefit her to have this change poisoned?  Are you sure it's in her best interest to be told something like that, or do you just want to make sure she doesn't think better of her father than you believe he deserves?\n\nLet it be. If she asks again, tell her that sometimes, even very important relationships can be complicated and parents sometimes don't realize what they're doing to their kids until they do. Tell her that you're sure her father loves her, even if he hasn't always been good at expressing it, and even if that love has been wrapped up with complicated feelings about your marriage. Tell her that maybe, when the time is right, it's a conversation best had between father and daughter.\n\nIf the treatment has been distinct enough for her to notice and become cognizant of the fact that her father favors the other two children, it's long past time to consider therapy. Working with a professional could probably benefit you and her in terms of handling this and working on some of the emotional damage that's been done.", "I\u2019d wait to tell Julie the truth. Right now, her happiness needs to usurp anything else. I know my dad had to step up when I was her age and I did sports. He would come to my games and expect me to be happy to see him. I just wanted my mom, but she was sick a lot.

Or that maybe she can ask him herself?", "Your ex has found a way to connect to his daughter through sports. Lots of men become more interested in their kids when they are older and out of the baby stage. \n\nYou divorced your husband because he fell out of love with you and did not trust you to be faithful and did not believe you when you said there was nobody else. You could not live with a man who did not trust you.", "Don't tell her. If anybody tells her it should be her dad and it should come in the form of an apology and a solemn promise to do better, and you should tell him that.", "YWNBTA\n\nI\u2019d work with a child therapist that is a good fit for you and the kids, and work on telling her the truth. All the kids should know the truth. \n\nKids are smart, perceptive (helps with survival), telling her the truth will help fill in the gaps to something she\u2019s already figuring out. Obviously do it in a way that lends itself to her development. \n\nYour ex is a disgraceful man. Even after it was confirmed Julie was his daughter he still treated her poorly (to the point she noticed), and doesn\u2019t sound like he ever apologized to you (or her). Now he\u2019s taking interest in Julie because she\u2019s shown talent. Piss off.\n\nIt\u2019s strange he tried so hard for children only to become a shitty parent.", "NTA. She deserves to know. Just be gentle and Honest, no little white lies to ease the blow because that Will backfire at some point, be honest and factual.", "[removed]", "She's mature enough to have noticed and asked, so she's deserving of an honest answer. Sit down with her and tell her the truth, with as little personal bias as possible. Do not blow her off or give a half-hearted explanation; she grew up with her dad giving her that kind of dismissive treatment, and it hurt her deeply.", "Your ex sounds like a deeply troubled person, so I would guess it won't get easier in the future. It's not nice, but it's probably better than getting her hopes up and then beeing unable to understand why he would cast her aside, when somewhen in the future she unavoidable will do something that will disappoint him.

As someone with an also crappy bio dad, this girl is too young to understand it all, or at least the detailed version on this post.\n\nI\u2019d say wait and see how the relationship between father and daughter will develop, OP needs to pay attention to know if the sport is a condition for their relationship or a jumpstart, if it\u2019s the latter probably best to let them bond as long as it\u2019s healthy and just tell the girl when she\u2019s older.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

True, but not having an explanation for the treatment before then would probably lead to her concluding that she's only valuable if she's an athlete and her self-worth gets tied up in that.\n\nIf she tries to figure out why he didn't like her, and has some crazy theory (that I can't make up bc it's late here), does OP refute, deflect, or what?\n\nI think maybe this is a good start when followed by that first script, because whatever her guess is could reveal some other issues she's dealing with, but OP can still give her the choice to hear the truth if she wants it.\n\nUltimately I think a family counselor is going to be the best shot at finding the best approach here. And I think it's absolutely necessary even if the question can't hang until an appointment can be made.", "I agree with this beginning. The person you responded too made it a bit too dramatic and it\u2019d probably alarm the girl immediately. If OP wants this to be a productive conversation I could not recommend it less."]}
