I never cheated on him. I never did anything of the sort. But the final straw was when he demanded a DNA test. I told him if he doesn't trust me and takes the test, then I will file for divorce.

I'm torn on this since she already knows something isn't right. The not knowing why might be just as bad as knowing why. She's not 8 anymore and sooner or later she will find out the truth. Will when she finds out say five years from now she'll also have to come to term that her mom has been lying to her for many years.\n\nI would say she deserves the truth and she already suspects it's not pretty.

I think discussing such details right now would be disasterous.", "YWNBTA-Normally, my go-to is that kids don't need to know everything about their parents and don't need to be involved in adult relationships. However, she is directly affected in this situation, and she is confused and upset so you can't really skirt the issue. \n\nShe is likely enjoying this new side to her dad, and she's insecure as to whether it's going to last.  It sounds like she's afraid that she had done something in the past to deserve his treatment and that she's going to do something to lose the relationship she has with him now.  It's just not fair to leave her in that kind of mindset.\n\nShe knows there's something off here and you need to make it clear to her that it isn't about anything she's done or doing.

But it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s curious & had noticed that her dad didn\u2019t particularly like or care for her in her early formative years. On the other hand if she finds out later she could be mad at both of you or even blame herself for the divorce. You also don\u2019t want your ex to try to change the narrative. My advice would be to speak with a child therapist & see what they think would be the best & regardless of your choice Julie should be put into counseling because she obviously has feelings of neglect from her dad. \n\nThere truly isn\u2019t a right or wrong answer", "YWBTA\nI would not lie -  but just say it feels inappropriate to share right now.

I would simply say, \"you have the most in common with your dad, it's nice you can bond over sports\"\n\nEnd of discussion.  \n\nHe's not using her or manipulating her by taking a interest in her.

But right now he is at least acting like a good dad and that's important. The risk is what happen if he changes, that could be devastating to your daughter.

That's already bad and your ex will need to fix that and apologize. \n\nHowever you telling her the truth is a different story. You can't know every outcome so get advice as to how this might impact her. Ultimately it doesn't matter as much whether her relationship to a bad father is ruined or not compared to how this impacts her own well-being. I am not an expect so can't say if it is generally better for her to know now or not so seek that advice.\n\nShe does deserve the truth eventually but it might have to come from the person who caused the problems to begin with.

She knows her dad didn't treat her the same as her siblings...and now he is being loving towards her. But she doesn't trust it. \n\nThis totally sucks.    If he had changed...then HE should tell her....\"honey, I made a mistake. I blamed you but it was my fault.

My heart is breaking contemplating all of this.", "YTA\n\n**This is not information that is helpful to Julie in any way. Julie is not your therapist.

Children take the negative feelings assigned towards the other parent or by the other parent in divorce situation and apply them to themselves. They internalize all that hate. So she's not going to hear, \"Oh, okay. There's nothing wrong with me. Daddy's just an AH. NOW I get it!\" What she's going to hear is that her daddy wanted sibling #1 and sibling #2 but detested her so much that he hated her before she was ever born. She's going to internalize that there is something wrong with her because her own father couldn't love her, and has never loved her. And you explaining it more and validating it more and making it all about infertility and perceived infidelity is not going to make it all magically okay. It's just going to make it all worse.\n\nDon't go there. What you need to do is keep being an amazing positive mom and be there for your daughter. When she's much, much older (adult and only if she asks!) you can tell her, non-specifically, that your marriage started having problems before she was born and it had nothing to do with her.

However he is rebuilding the relationship and it is kind of irrelevant why.  She is benefitting from it.  \n\nYou can however say you don't know (which you 100 percent do not know you only suspect) why the relationship changed and encourage her to talk to her father.  This is a skill set she can use as an adult if she does attempt it.  We spend so much of our time wondering and making assumptions and questioning ourselves when we could go ask the source.

He would always put time and effort into getting our 2 other kids a thoughtful gift and would always give Julie a gift card. The monetary value would always be near/the same, but the process of getting the gifts were always lackluster when it came to Julie.

That's where I'm at an impasse.", "She hopes her daughter will hate her ex husband because of what he did and feel the same way about him as she does.\n\nThat's what this is all leading to if it works out as intended.", "She'd be happy her daughter only likes her again.

Not nagging, honestly asking", ">he is rebuilding the relationship and it is kind of irrelevant why\n\nNot really. What would happen if she loses interest in sports? He'll dump her again", "I really think that this is the right approach. If Julie thinks that her father used to neglect her and she has now noticed, as you have, that he doesn't neglect her anymore, then she should talk to him about it. She deserves an answer \\*from him\\*. Since she is confused about her father's behavior toward her, therapy also seems like a good idea.", "I was her age when I found out some truths about my father from my mother in response to my questions about my lack of relationship with him (unless it was convenient). It helped me a lot with understanding it was his issue and not mine. I appreciated my mom for not lying to protect him.", "well unless the mother treats the kid as an unwanted child and they ask about that... If she is upset to the point of crying only for voicing her questions it is not far to her to just dismiss the question or gaslight her. \n\nYes, she did not need to know, so her dad shouldn't have behaved in a way for her to know for a decade.", "My main concern in not telling Julie is that then she secretly may think it's something she did. Even if you tell her she didn't do anything, even if *he* tells her she didn't do anything, he has clearly treated her very differently, and as a kid/teen it's easy to internalize that stuff and assume that it's your fault somehow. Telling her the truth puts the blame squarely where it belongs - on his shoulders. \n\nI understand not wanting to shit-talk the other parent, but it's not shit-talking if it's the (carefully, tactfully stated) truth. I'm not going to pretend that it won't damage her relationship with her father, but she already knows something is \"off\". \n\nShe'll also likely figure out at least half of the reason on her own (kids aren't stupid) and then she's going to feel like if she messes up/isn't good enough at sports, dad will go back to treating her poorly.

OR tell her it is extremely complicated and you aren't comfortable talking about it with her yet. She is your daughter. You should be able to feel whether or not she can handle the truth. Because it happened, it's her life. She will inevitably find out. It's just on what terms.", "Your daughter is smart and talented, if you just brush her off now, she might never come to you with her concerns again.

What she deserves is for her concerns not to be brushed off or dismissed completely.", "Saying she'll have answers and jer knowing the truth are the same thing. \n\nWhich is why I'm asking can you actually give a positive thing out of this?", "that breaks my heart.  so basically he made it obvious he didnt treat or show care like the siblings.   then in my heart i think becuase she is smart and seeing she had tears means she thought alot and not said anything wondering what she did that he didnt love her.  she deserves to hear it.", "She's 12. There's no impasse. You'd be a irresponsible parent to discuss this with a twelve year old. Inexcusable.", "She\u2019s too young to process that information at a healthy level. She\u2019ll figure it out as an adult.", "This is not an \"impasse\" that leads to good places for her, is the thing.\n\nShe knows there is something wrong with her relationship with her day. She knows he treats her siblings better than her. This is not news.\n\nThe information you are going to provide is not going to do anything to make Julie feel better. Her knowing that her dad was upset you couldn't get pregnant with her and deeply resented her.... helps how? Her knowing that her dad believed she wasn't his kid and forced you to get a pregnancy test and said she didn't look like she was his, and thought her sister did look like she was his... helps how? Her knowing that her dad accused you of infidelity because she didn't look like him, and that you later divorced over it... helps how? \n\nYou are looking at this as a 45 year old adult. You have forgotten what it is like to think like a 12 year old child. It's been too long. Children internalize negative emotions they associate with their parents. It's why it's so important not to badmouth the other parent in a divorce. They don't hear \"your dad is an ass, but you're nothing like him.\" They hear, he's horrible and he is part of me so I am horrible too.\"\n\nAll these little pieces of information that she is too young to have will be very damaging to her. Personally I don't think she ever needs to have them. I think you need to have her in therapy and need to have that child therapist talking to her on a weekly basis about her poor relationship with her jerk of a father. And you should be reiterating how you got divorced because the marriage had serious problems that were between the two of you. But she doesn't need adult details. She is not your girlfriend, priest or therapist. She is TWELVE.", "Or maybe she realizes that he would dump julie once she stops playing soccer. How is op the bad one here,  i don't understand!! Julie knows something is not right, since her dad ignored her for 12 years.", "I hate the fact that he mistreated our daughter for 12 years. I hate the fact that if she didn't play soccer, he still wouldn't be interested in her. I hate the fact that if she quits soccer, he may go back to treating her like garbage and ruin the relationship they built.

I just hate his actions and his treatment of our daughter.", "Or maybe she is worried because julie knows her dad would dump her again. He is the bad guy here, who ignored his kid for 12 years and now plays the loving father part only because she plays a sport. What would happen when she stops playing??", "Like if he says, \"I've always loved you the same\"?", "She is making assumptions.  \n\nShe has no idea why she just believes something which may be correct but it is also skewed because she is a woman scorned.  \n\nIf it does happen she picks her daughter up, brushes her off and teaches her that her value is not based on another person's opinion of her.  \n\nAs much as you want to protect your children giving them information about other peoples relationships with them is not going to help them when you yourself are emotionally charged. \n\nWhat happens if she tells her this stuff and she walks up to her dad and says mom said xy and z.  Now remember mom doesn't actually know so he can provide proof of some of what she is saying is wrong because she did NOT  know.  Now everything her mom has told her is wrong.  Her whole bad relationship with her father can be easily misconstrued to be the mothers fault.... and at the end of the day her mother gave her the thoughts that started this.  Not a smart move.  You are dealing with a teenager.", "That is semantics. Hating his actions and treatment of Julie is essentially hating him. You have every right to hate him, but you also have the responsibility to be the adult here and give Julie the best chance of happiness. That is best achieved by Julie feeling loved. \n\nIt sounds like Julie is enjoying this attention from her dad right now. Why not talk with him about his behavior, and the questions she asks? Why not get her a therapist to help her navigate these complicated feelings, and probably get one of your own?\n\nNAH except your ex, but don\u2019t tell her at this juncture. YWBTAH. It is eating at you far more than her. Honestly, I don\u2019t blame you for wanting Julie to reject him now that he wants to be in her life (it would feel like justice), but this will be so damaging to her at this point. Right now she thinks she finally earned his affection with soccer; which is upsetting alone\u2026she doesn\u2019t need to think that her existence/face is why her parents divorced. If you tell her anything, tell her that you worry about how her dad can be hot and cold, and that it isn\u2019t her fault. And therapy.\n\nETA: Can you shut down the unequal treatment? That is really damaging to kids. Can you draw a line in the sand with him? Can your kids band together to stop unequal treatment, and do they ever talk about this? This should affect the custody arrangement because he is not being a good father.", "If Julie jumped in a bounce house tomorrow and broke her leg and was told she could never play again... she'd be ignored once again.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that mom has a TRUMP card that is so massively destructive to dad and his daughter.   \n\nThe saying, \"do the ends justify the means?\"", "Then tell her to discuss it with her father. She's TWELVE. This is not an appropriate conversation for her to have with a 12 year old at all.", "More like slight manipulation of the truth to make him look victimized:\n\n\"We divorced because your mum obviously cheated and I didn't treat you the same cause I had a suspicion you were not mine. But no worries you are\"\n\nbut sure, gaslighting her and saying she was making up things in her head is also an option that OP should be prepared for.\n\nNot sure, but I can't seem to imagine him admitting he got totally paranoid, screwed up his marriage, and unfairly treated his daughter like second-rate citizen (even after confirming her DNA) out of denial and shame until she proved useful as a soccer prodigy.", "If Julie asked her mom why he suddenly likes her now, it would at least suggest he treated her like he didn\u2019t.", ">She is making assumptions.\n\nFor 12 years he ignored his daughter. Now he is part of her life only because she plays soccer. \n\n>brushes her off and teaches her that her value is not based on another person's opinion of her.\n\nKind of hard when that another person is your dad. \n\n>Her whole bad relationship with her father can be easily misconstrued to be the mothers fault....\n\nNo, it can't. He is the one who pretty much abandoned her. \n\n>and at the end of the day her mother gave her the thoughts that started this\n\nNo, i think it was the fact that for 12 years he ignored her and now he's the soccer dad. The kid isn't dumb, her dad didn't pay any attention to her for all her life, and now all of a sudden he is involved in her life. \n\nHow tf can this woman be blamed when her husband literally abandoned their child is beyond me!! She even agreed to the dna test, so that julie would have a chance at a relationship with her asshole dad.", ">that mom has a TRUMP card that is so massively destructive to dad and his daughter. \n\nYou mean the truth? You said it yourself, he'll ignore her again. I think it's better for her to not have fake hopes of a loving relationship.", "Oh it never occurred to me that he would do that. So you think OP should get ahead of potential lie from ex to set the record straight?", "I did not say she was to blame.  I said when she tells the kid things the kid confronts dad.... all dad needs to do is prove one thing wrong or skew it.  She is about to be a teenager.  Once she feels her mom gave her skewed information she will feel everything is.\n\nHe never abandon her he has always been around he just didn't treat her the same as the other kids.  We actually do not know why this is.  The moms relationship with the dad stopped. It could have been he did not feel this was his child or maybe he had a tough time bonding with her.  \n\nFrom the moms story the dad is an ass which I have already stated.  However the mom is also a woman scorned and this is the man that scorned her.  You can see the pain that her daughter is rekindling a relationship with this horrible man from how she describes it.\n\nShe is making an emotional charged decision and what we learnt as emotionally charged teenagers (or should have) is that you never make decisions in this frame of mind or speak of others during this time to people who care about the other person.", "She's too young for this conversation.  It's too destructive at such a young age.", "well more like to break the truth in as well, but in a gentle manner as much as possible. The girl's not stupid obviously, even if he did go there she would still feel something's wrong, but if her mother refuses to tell her while she asks her, she might not come back later and ends up bottling unnecessarily. \n\nI think it is much less risky for the mother to explain than to trust the father wit it, who already proved capable of not caring for his daughter's feelings before.", ">never abandon her he has always been around he just didn't treat her the same as the other kids.\n\nThis was even worse. \n\n>It could have been he did not feel this was his child\n\nHe literally did a dna test. \n\n>You can see the pain that her daughter is rekindling a relationship with this horrible man from how she describes it.\n\nNo, you can see her being worried about how her daughter would be affected when her dad would go back to ignore her and treat her like less. \n\nYou're making this to be about op being jealous, but it's about her being worried that her daughter would once again be treated like dirt by her dad. You're grasping at straws to make op the bad one here.", "Valid point. It would be up to OP to determine if her ex would be straight with the daughter.", "How can I make her the bad one? \n\nShe hasn't done anything.\n\nI am giving her sound advice that will protect her daughter in the long run. From a non emotional response.  \n\nMy arguments were for you.  Not for her.  You were adding wrong information and are making assumptions yourself."]}
