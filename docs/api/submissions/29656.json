While we were driving home my daughter saw her friend and asked if we could see if she was okay. She was walking home in the rain, and was very obviously cold. I rolled down my daughter\u2019s window and she asked if everything was alright, she said it was but her grandmother was staying with them and her parents didn\u2019t want to drag her wheelchair into the car lift her into the seat just to drive a few minutes and get her back out, I asked her if she needed a ride and she said sure but she didn\u2019t want to be a bother, I said it was fine and I\u2019d bother me more if I knew I let her get drenched when I could\u2019ve done something about it, she agreed and got into the car and I drive her home where her parents berated me for \u201ckidnapping\u201d their daughter and called me a creep. For the record I know my daughters friend and her parents we\u2019ve know each since they were nine they\u2019re currently fifteen. And I\u2019m not a stranger to her or her parents, I just didn\u2019t want to leave her in the rain to get soaked when I had room in my car for one more. So AITA for driving my daughters friend home?\n\nSomeone asked my gender, I\u2019m a male but I\u2019m gay, idk if that changes anything but it felt important\n\nBtw I\u2019m not shaming her parents for not coming to get her, The grandmother isn\u2019t in very good shape so she can\u2019t be left alone and I\u2019ve seen them drag her in and out of their car it seems very hard so I understand why they wouldn\u2019t want to do it, I just felt bad watching their daughter walk around in the rain. I\u2019ve also done this before they this is the only time they\u2019ve reacted this way\n\nOkay, so I realized that ever since I officially came out last June they\u2019ve started being distant so I\u2019m gonna ask them if it\u2019s cause I\u2019m gay", "created_utc": 1698267656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17geylv/aita_for_driving_my_daughters_friend_home_while/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only reason I can think of for them reacting like that is that they somehow felt like you were judging them (\"how bad of them to let their daughter walk in the rain, they must be so lazy, I'll show them how it's done\").

Whatever.\n\nIn that case, instead of keeping blaming themselves for not being good enough, it's some sort of intuitive defense to instead trying to put down the reason why they feel bad at first: you. So they berate you, this way their brain see you as the bad guy and not the perfect parent that even cared for their daughter, and they don't have to feel guilty for not taking care of their daughter themselves. That's totally unconscious thinking, so they're probably not even aware. And if you were to try and calmly speak to them about it, unconsciously that \"perfect calm parent\" vibe will set them off and push them to beat you further down.\n\nMy advice would be to just ignore that comment.

I started also grabbing other kids, driving them home first, then returning to my house with my fosters.\n\nNow, even If I don't have high school age fosters, several of the kids in the neighborhood and their families know me.

On occasion, there is a kid that I don't know, but the other kids know them and tell them to hop in the car too.\n\nOnly once, a parent of one of the kids that I don't know gave me a real attitude about it. I was never alone with their child. I'm 50s female. We actually dropped that kid off first.

One could have stayed back with grandma while the other went and got daughter, unless there are some extenuating circumstances that require 2 adult supervision 24/7 they could have figured out how to fetch their own kid instead of making her slog it home in the rain. I agree with comments stating parents are probably homophobic.", "Why would they both have to drag grandma into the car to go get the daughter?Couldn\u2019t just one of them go?", "This is the obvious answer.

They were caught out being AWFUL parents and OP showed them up.", "Yeah they need to read the definition of kidnapping\u2026not even close.  And 1 why did the grandma even need to come..they can\u2019t leave her for a few minutes? 2 if they had to take her, why would she need to be taken out of the car to pick up the daughter, 3 what kind of parents accuse someone they\u2019ve known for years and 4 what kind of parents would prefer their kid walks home on the freezing rain rather than be dropped off by a family friend?  Very strange.  And OP is NTA", "Parents are insane. Why did they both need to stay home with the grandma? They suck", "I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s \u201ckidnapping\u201d IANAL, but if something happened to her (ie car accident) OP could be in trouble being that he had her in his car without parental permission. This is something that happened in my community. Parents would always give classmates rides home or wherever without a second thought  until there was an accident and the parent driving got in major legal trouble for having a child in his car without parental permission. They were the \u201cnicest, chillest\u201d parents before that and no one ever thought that there would legal consequences. We all drove other kids around and prob many parents on this sub do too!   It\u2019s kind of like letting the neighborhood kids play in your yard until there is an injury and the parents sue you to doomsday. \n\nPersonally, we (parents in my kids friend groups) got together and texted each other in a group chat that we allow are kids to have rides with each other so we are covered. My kids know who it is ok to get a ride with and who needs a phone call to me or my husband before they get in the car. Similarly, I\u2019m happy to drive other kids around, but if it\u2019s not a kid whose parents are in our group- I call or text them before driving them anywhere. It sounds sad, but this is the world we live in. \n\nIn this case, it could be that the girl\u2019s parents were embarrassed that they didn\u2019t pick her up and let her get drenched and took it out on OP. \n\nOr, maybe, even though OP knows the girl and her parents for years they don\u2019t have a close relationship and the girl\u2019s parents didn\u2019t want her in his car. There are parents that I know since our kids were little (they\u2019ve been in the same class for years!) that I wouldn\u2019t trust to drive my kids around (ie the parent doesn't require passengers to wear seatbelts, always texting and driving, speeding, smoking in the car etc) I\u2019m obviously not saying that OP does any of that. I just wonder if he had ever given this girl a ride before. It seems like a very strong reaction from the girl\u2019s parents. (Again, it could be the first option-that they were embarrassed). \n\nBut, in general, if it\u2019s not a regular carpool and just a one off where a kid needs a ride-call or text the parent so you are covered.", "TBH, I'm not sure they understand how kidnapping works. If you're going to kidnap someone, you don't take them to their home", "Heck I was that kid who was a total stranger to the parent and was grateful to get a lift from a friends parent halfway home one particularly awful snowy day.", "That was my thought too, why does the grandma even factor in? Leave her at home, or only one parent go get the kid, sounds like shit parents making excuses and projecting.\n\nOP is NTA, good job looking out for the kid.", "I agree.  Why do they both have to go", "Picked her up without parental permission from the other replays I\u2019ve gotten but that\u2019s all what seems to be wrong in other people\u2019s minds", "It\u2019s good, we get along okay as far as I know", "I\u2019m a guy but I\u2019m gay, and they\u2019re aware of that, idk if that changed anything but it felt important", "Shared throwaway account, easier then making a new one", "I\u2019ll ask", "Nothing to leave out, I said what she told me, her parents didn\u2019t want to hall her grandmother into the car, so I picked her up and drove her home\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I dont know I texted them and asked if I had crossed a boundary or something and they haven\u2019t responded", "So was I supposed to let her walk home in the rain?\nAlso as I stated in the post, they didn\u2019t want to come pick her up, this wasn\u2019t a, she missed the bus, senerio.

The poor child was walking home in the rain because her own parents couldn't be bothered to pick her up.", "If the the friend would have take a taxi or bus without her parents permission, is that also kidnapping?", "If both parents were home why couldn't one pick up their daughter and the other stay home with Grandma? Strange family.", "Can't one parent picked her up while the other stays with grandma??? Shifty excuse", "> if something happened to her (ie car accident) OP could be in trouble being that he had her in his car without parental permission\n\nA teenager is able to hail a cab or take the bus on their own volition.\n\nParents don't give permission to those drivers. Would *they* get in trouble?", "Well.. my mother just to joke that  if i would get kidnapped she wouldnt need to worry because after an hour of so they would be so annoyed by my nonstop talking about my favorit pokemon or DBZ that they would just bring me home after an hour or so.  \n\nSo you are telling me that was a lie? /s", "Exactly!!", "Maybe OP is just *really* bad at this whole kidnapping thing. And like at least one other person in the comments, I'm wondering why Grandma can't be left alone for a few minutes or, as it sounded like both parents were home, one couldn't go get the daughter while the other stayed home.\n\nNTA, OP", "Then I feel like something is missing, but as far as I know you are NTA, I mean if some one I know give a ride to my kid I don\u2019t get why I would be mad, they overreact the question is why?", "Sounds like they're deranged, then.", "I've been on reddit for about a year now. I state facts, people argue. Give my opinion, they argue. So here is my response to that, probably here on out. Don't come to AITA if all you want is verification that you did the right thing. My explanation of verdict is generally in the first comment, and if Google doesn't help you understand or see my side, nothing will. Have a great day.\n\nEdited voice to text", "You don't have to reply to people you don't agree with.
