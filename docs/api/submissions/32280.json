Acting like there's an emergency like that, causing you to rush to her side... she could have gotten you all worked up to the point that you might have been in a car accident while driving to her.  She *risked your safety*.  For a stupid test.  Basically for shits and giggles.\n\nShe will inconvenience you and put your safety at risk, just for the fun of it, over and over again until someone manages to teach her a serious lesson, and I honestly think that breaking up with her is the only way to potentially do that without actually getting hurt yourself.", "NTA and DTMFA", "NTA\n\nRun!!", "She's too immature to be dating, maybe 14 instead of 29?", "NTA.

Your reaction was exactly what I would've expected for someone who'd been tricked into thinking a loved one was dying for the other person's emotional gratification. Your emotions, and knowing that she won't play with them to a dangerous or damaging effect at any time it suits her, are at least as valid as hers.\n\nAs mentioned, she may be unaware of how appalling this kind of thing is. It's important that the two of you sit down and have a face to face chat about how this made you feel.\n\nMaybe ask her why she felt it was a reasonable thing to do. Then perhaps point out to her that in an emergency situation like this, it's quite common for partners to race to the scene, heedless of their own safety, and often doing things like running red lights to get there because they think their loved one is dying.  \n  How would she have felt if you'd done that, and been killed in an auto wreck? As shocking as the question might sound, it's not at all unlikely - thousands of people die in car accidents every year, and peoples' judgement is incredibly poor when they're panicking about a loved one who may die before they can reach them.\n\nGames and baiting like the trick she played have consequences. The worst possible consequence would be that you could get injured or make a major life mistake as a result of something she does on a casual whim.  \n  Even the lesser consequences could be enormous if events like this keep happening; they could lead to a huge lack of trust between the two of you, and a feeling that she has no respect for your mental wellbeing. Lack of trust and respect are enormous red flags for any relationship, and will almost guarantee it to break down over time. As partners, you'll often be the only people on each others' side when facing life's difficulties. You need to know that you care enough about each others' emotions for that to be there.\n\nIf she's 'the one', although she may be upset and defensive initially when confronted with these points (people generally don't like facing up to the fact they've done something wrong, as it's upsetting and humiliating to realise you've hurt someone), she'll listen to them and respond sooner or later with the answer that she understands where you're coming from, and won't do things like this again.\n\nIf she's all about self-gratification, you'll probably get guilt-tripped for making her feel bad about her behaviour, and no acknowledgement that your feelings are valid - leaving you in permanent doubt about when you're being manipulated, and what's genuine.\n\nI really hope that she embraces your feelings and engages with you in a grown-up and honest conversation about this where the two of you can be calm and understanding about a way to move forwards, and that the two of you can move on to a better understanding of each other.", "NTA (I mean, you could have gotten mad without calling her a bitch)\n\nBut this is a major red flag, I would not stay in a relationship with someone that did this to me", "Women \u2615\ufe0f", "lol this is going to get downvoted but everyone sucks here. \n\nHer for being insane and toxic and also you for responding by escalating and using gendered insults.\n\nJust break up with her and move on with your life.
