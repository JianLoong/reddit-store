{"id": 19983, "submission_id": "14cnuqe", "title": "AITA for being the reason my parents and brother may become homeless?", "selftext": "Let me preface this post by saying I love my family but I can't live with them anymore. I'm a single mom (34) and I\u2019m doing my best to provide my daughter (15) with a good life. Right now, my parents (55, 58) and brother (32) live with me in a 2-bedroom apartment, which means I share a bedroom with my daughter. I hate it because I want her to have her own space and be a normal teenager who slams their bedroom door shut and mopes around. It\u2019s not possible because my parents use the other (bigger) bedroom and my brother sleeps in the living room.   \n\n\nMy parents are extremely religious and believe God will send them a miracle and they\u2019ll have a wonderful, money-filled life soon. The thing is, they\u2019ve been waiting for this \u2018miracle\u2019 for more than 10 years now. They\u2019ve been given \u2018prophecies\u2019 and dreams that indicate that God has \u2018something big in store for them\u2019. In the meantime, my dad lost his job and doesn\u2019t work. My mom doesn\u2019t work either.   \n\n\nEvery time I ask them when God will be delivering on those promises, they say \u2018soon\u2019 and we just have to be patient. The sad thing is they really believe all that bull. I\u2019m so tired of living with them because we don\u2019t get along and my mom and I are regularly in some argument about the dumbest things. I get treated like a child and neither my nor my daughter's opinions are taken seriously.   \n\n\nMy and my daughter\u2019s social lives have suffered because we can\u2019t bring anyone to my place as they\u2019ll be confronted by a messy living room since my brother isn\u2019t the cleanest person and my parents are always at home. My brother has an online writing job, but it takes him weeks to complete his work and he doesn\u2019t get paid that much, so he\u2019s not contributing to our living costs. My parents don\u2019t contribute anything either.   \n\n\nMy daughter\u2019s mental health is also suffering because she doesn\u2019t get along with my parents (she tries her best to) because of how obnoxiously religious they are. I know that her anxiety and depression (and my own) will be easier to handle in a healthy way when we\u2019re in our own place. I\u2019m planning to move away but that will mean my parents and brother won\u2019t have someone to pay their rent or buy them food anymore-they\u2019ll be homeless.   \n\n\nAITA for considering leaving them behind and getting a place for me and my daughter?", "created_utc": 1687103786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cnuqe/aita_for_being_the_reason_my_parents_and_brother/", "score": 4139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
