In Judaism there is a rule \"Don't put an obstacle in front of a blind man\". That would apply here if the two of you shared your food and you left the pork pickles in the communal refrigerator. Since you don't share food and the pickles were in your private space, you did nothing wrong - he did.", "NTA.  He should've asked what was in them before trying any, and also shouldn't have been sneaking around in your stuff to get more.", "NTA Tell he shouldn't worry about going to hell for eating pork, because he was already going there for stealing.", "NTA. He stole your food out of your room?? It literally his own fault; he's made his bed he can lie in it.", "NTA NTA NTA", "NTA.  He shouldn't have gone into your room and shouldn't have eaten your food.  He's definitely the asshole here.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe a their respect of their dietary preferences", "NTA and Good riddance for you.", "NTA. You did not feed him forbidden food; he stole it. You don't need a roommate that \"snoops around\" your private space. (I don't know what an \"almirah\" is, but if you keep it locked, clearly it's private to you.)", "He's the asshole not you.", "NTA. The food was in the almirah in your room. He entered your room, searched your cupboard, and took the food. He assumed that since one jar was chicken, so would any jar he found while snooping. That might be a message from Allah teaching him boundaries.\n\nNow, any food stored in communal areas that is forbidden to either roommate must be disclosed. \n\nDo not assume this was the first time he snooped. Good locks make good roommates, in future. \n\nIn future, to avoid unpleasantness, if you have a Muslim roommate, remind him that some of the food you eat might be haram, and so he should ask before partaking. This is what you tell his family. You did not feed him any pork. You shared chicken with him. When people with strict dietary rules sneak into someone\u2019s room and rifle through their almirah, they might consume something haram. That\u2019s on them.", "You didn\u2019t *feed* him anything. In fact, you\u2019d kept it in your private stuff, so other people *wouldn\u2019t* eat it. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure theft is a more serious transgression than eating pork, if he\u2019s really that worried. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHe stole forbidden food. That is a rather fine example of the punishment following closely upon the crime", "NTA, and also, what the hell??? He went into your personal stuff and stole some of your food and is now upset that it was something he should not eat?\n\nI say it's karma.", "NTA.  You didn't feed him anything.  He stole from you.  Then ate it himself.  All without your knowledge.  It is his greed.  And deception.  That did this.", "NTA. You didn't feed it to him, he stole it from you. He can act like you maliciously fed him pork but this is simply the consequence of eating food that doesn't belong to you. He can stay mad, but he chose to steal your food and there's nobody else to blame for that. You're nicer than I am because I'd be watching him angrily moving out like he has any right to be mad and I'd ask him for the money to replace the food he stole from me lol. \n\nThis is like saying I'm allergic to shrimp, you hid a shrimp dinner in your room, I went into your room without asking and helped myself to your food, had an allergic reaction because IT WASN'T MY FOOD SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT,  and now I'm mad at YOU for having shrimp and \"making\" me have an allergic reaction. \n\nPeople like this look everywhere for fault but never at themselves. Ignore his family too. Start asking them for money to replace the food he stole since they're in his/your business. Ask them who raised him to steal food. Block them. You didn't do anything wrong.\n\nEdited to fix a spelling error.", "NTA", "You don't get to be mad at people for stealing their treif/haram/etc food.  NTA", "I came to this thread for the assholery but now I'm staying for all the pickle recipes.", "NTA this is hilarious. He stole it and didn't know what it was. His fault. He's the AH.", "I've seen mutton pickle too. I've seen it for sale in some stores but could never get myself to try some. My sister says meat pickles are delicious. I'll stick to my tamarind, mango and lime pickles.", "I'm sure there is some state or county fair with such a food item.  most likely in the south", "Upset_Homework_4056 is one of those bots that posts generic agreeing comments, downvote and report so the account can't be used for nefarious purposes", "Rollmop herrings are a thing. I love beetroot, I ate it so much my pee was pink and I thought I was dying.", "I know kosher = haram and both those words refer to more than dietary restrictions. \n\nI know treif (also trayf) as referring to prohibited food; I don\u2019t know if it also refers to the larger idea of against Jewish law.\n\nThat\u2019s the extent of my knowledge. Maybe someone who is actually Jewish would have a clearer idea.", "He stole from me does not explain. Sounds like OP tricked him because he had previously stolen from him or something. It needs to be \"He broke into my room, rummaged through my belongings, and stole some food He found there. It is not my fault He is a THIEF. Or that he apparently cannot read. Stealing is a sin\" Copy and paste that", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Love lime pickle. Especially my mother's homemade stuff.
