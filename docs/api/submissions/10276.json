This is 100% on him.", "I'm tempted to say E-S-H because meat in a pickle sounds nauseating to me, but I digress.\n\nIn all seriousness, no you are absolutely NTA. He entered your space and ate your food. He's the one with a dietary restriction so the burden is on him to know what he's eating beforehand. You had no obligation to tell him what was in your room when you didn't give him permission to be there in the first place.

Of course not. BLANK went into my room uninvited, snooped through my stuff, stole my food, and then got upset it was pork. That was a choice he made.

I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re dealing with this situation. No one needs that level of drama in their own home.\n\nYour housemate behaved very badly. If you do choose to communicate with his family I would be explicit about what happened.\n\nI have a strong feeling that he was selective in what he chose to tell them. No decent family would condone their son\u2019s stealing from a housemate, even from an unlocked cupboard.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that he ate something treif (my mother\u2019s family is Jewish and that\u2019s the word I know for food not in compliance with religious law). But it resulted from his own inappropriate actions and his family should know that.\n\nIf his family is, above all, concerned with the religious aspect they should know that his sin of eating pork is compounded by the acts of stealing and then lying about what happened.\n\nTake care, bhai.", "That\u2019s what happens when you snoop and steal people\u2019s food. It\u2019s like the office lunch thief who gets a surprise taste of hot sauce, except this guy also pissed off God.

Rent is just monthly and any long terms stays are mostly based on word of mouth commitment", "You're thinking of a different thing than Indians refer to as pickles, our pickling happens in salt, chilli powder and oil instead of in vinegar or a similar acidic agent :)", "Other pickled things are becoming more common in the US now! The obvious one most people don\u2019t think of is jalapenos from a jar, but it\u2019s fairly easy to find pickled green beans, carrots (my favorite), giardinera which usually has stuff like cauliflower and peppers, and onions. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, try making pickled fruits! They are delicious, even if it sounds like an odd thing.", "Allow my British self to introduce you to the joys of the pickled egg. Pickled cabbage, beetroot, and onions are also quite common - though I've not encountered pickled meats, myself.", "In the south we have pickled pigs feet, pickled eggs and pickled sausage. It\u2019s definitely a regional thing.", "I was imagining chicken and pork stock (like what you use for soup) in the pickling liquid", "The Islamic equivalent of treif is haram, I believe. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s roommate\u2019s religion, from location anyway. It\u2019s so interesting how many laws Jewish and Muslim people share that made it all the way to modern times.", "Definitely, pickling is such a cool way of preparing food that we don\u2019t use much anymore.", "Honestly, that shorter explanation gives the impression that OP might have intentionally laid a trap for the roommate because he was already in the habit of theft. Whereas what really happened was that OP was just storing their own food in their own room and had no expectation his greedy roommate would break in and steal his food.", "You have no idea how disappointed my pregnant ass is right now.", "That sounds delicious, it\u2019s making me hungry. Do you have any suggestions for a first Indian style pickle to try?", "That\u2019s interesting. I was more talking about the specific wording.  \n\nPickles in the US are pickled cucumbers. So when you say chicken pickle, most Americans would picture a pickled cucumber with chicken in it.

I was just talking about the wording of it tho. Like if you said \u201ccarrot pickles\u201d I don\u2019t think many people would immediately get that you meant pickled carrots.  Or if someone asked for pickles on their burger and you gave them pickled jalape\u00f1os, they might not be too happy about it.", "Yea I was just saying that things like pickled sausages aren\u2019t called pickles. You would say \u201cpickled sausages\u201d.", "It's definitely not just a southern thing. Most any small town bar I've been to in my area sells pickled eggs. Lots of tiny gas stations do as well. I'm not a fan of the eggs, but pickled pigs feet are delicious. \n\nPickled sausages are also very common in some central European countries.", "NGL that sounds really good haha", "I'm of South Asian descent and I've seen so many large external use bottles in relatives' kitchens! I googled it and you can apparently find edible mustard oil. I was curious why it would be banned and I came across [this](https://www.seriouseats.com/mustard-oil-guide) article.

I'm excited for you to try it haha! \n\nYou can look up videos on how it's eaten with meals, but you'd typically take a tiny bit with each mouthful of rice / bread and curry for added spice and tanginess. Enjoy!! :)", "Lime pickle is AMAZING. Approach with caution if you're not used to spice, but aaaaaah it's the best thing ever.", "Ohhhh, my bad \ud83d\ude05 I love pickled onions, would happily eat them on their own. Yeah, \u201cpickle\u201d on its own is a weird one here, but I guess it\u2019s like how people call tissues Kleenex or bandages Bandaids, regardless of brand.\n\nHopefully someone seeing this will try some pickled fruits though. I love spreading the word about them.", "It should always be marked \u2018for external use only\u2019 but ofc that doesn\u2019t prevent people using it to cook once they get it home", "Thank you! I\u2019m excited to try some, will go look for it on grocery shopping day \ud83e\udd70", "Definitely, pickling is such a cool way of preparing food that we don\u2019t use much anymore.
