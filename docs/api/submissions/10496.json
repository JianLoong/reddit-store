It\u2019s kind of high-stakes and competitive because there\u2019s a huge cash prize.\n\nNow, one of the rules of the competition is that you get paired with another random dancer, and you get to choose what song from a set playlist they dance to, or you can allow a random song to be generated for them.\n\nI was paired with the girl from my dance studio, and for some context, she often picks on me because I\u2019m one of the few male dancers in the group and she might be jealous because I\u2019ve been chosen for center roles in choreography more often than her.\n\nWhen we were paired, I had to go first, and she chose an sexually charged, feminine song for me to dance to (Super Freaky Girl by Nicki Minaj,) and was laughing at me with her friends when I went up. I tried my best at it, but it was pretty frustrating that she was trying to sabotage me. Thankfully, I barely scraped by to the next round of competition.\n\nNext, it was my turn to choose a song for her, and I opted to have a song randomly generated. It turned out to be an even more sexually charged song (it was WAP by Cardi B.) The rules are that I have up to three turns to randomly choose a song, but I chose to leave it at that song because I was tired AF and just wanted to leave and drink some water.\n\nI saw her performance, and she looked extremely uncomfortable and rigid throughout and at the end I think she was crying. Now her friends are calling me a jerk, but I don\u2019t see why they expected me to go out of my way to choose a better song for her when she intentionally tried to sabotage me.

Competition and cash prize.  Why should anyone be nice?", "NTA. Looks like she had to be taught the basics again. Treat others as you want to be treated. And she asked for it anyways.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t choose the song. You actually had it randomly generated, showing that you actually WERE NOT trying to embarrass her the same way. I\u2019m sure that if she hadn\u2019t tried to embarrass you, you would have changed the song.", "NTA - Whoever put that song into the list of randomizer's is. Sounds like she was a little malicious with her intent and karma followed suit.", "[deleted]", "NTA - Of course her friends villainized you, why does their opinion matter?", "Nta", "NTA. Sometimes, Karma be quick;)", "NTA \nYou gave her a taste of her own medicine. Karma is a bitch ya know", "NTA she shouldn't dish it out if she can't take it back", "NTA. Did she not just do the same thing to you?", "NTA. Suck it up buttercup! She wanted to play, so OP played back and she lost \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f then wanna cry, get tf out of here \ud83d\ude44", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d her do anything. If she was that opposed she could\u2019ve just refused to dance, If she\u2019s at competition level then she has to learn to adapt.", "ESH. Yeah, she was definitely being a jerk, but just letting her be very visibly uncomfortable really doesn't make you any better.", "NTA. You treat people the way you want to be treated. That's usually something we learn growing up as kids. She had no problem humiliating you, but she has a problem with the taste of her own medicine? That's her problem.", "NTA. She made a choice. The universe made one for you. Karma is a bitch sometimes.", "NTA. She tried to sabotage your performance & instant karma came for her.", "NTA if you\u2019re gonna sabotage someone- go first", "Info: what song did she choose for you? Funny you can remember WAP but not the song that promoted you to retaliate\u2026", "So you chose a random song and she danced to it. And on top of that she actively tried to humiliate you. Unless you're leaving out some info, NTA.", "It would be different if you were intentionally trying to embarrass her, but the song was randomly selected/generated.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd karma is a bitch only if you are one. Mus have been a delicious case of shadenfreunde.", "NTA - The song was randomly generated, so it\u2019s not like you intentionally chose it. If I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an AH even if you had chosen it yourself. Isn\u2019t WAP a pretty popular song to dance to? I don\u2019t see why that\u2019d be very embarrassing in a dancing competition, it\u2019s just dancing to a popular dance song. Of course she\u2019s allowed her feelings on it, and it\u2019s not a song she\u2019d choose for herself, but in a round where someone can choose ANY song\u2026it\u2019s also not something to get bent out of shape about.\n\nHave you talked with the owner of the studio about her behavior? If she\u2019s harassing you and trying to other you based solely on your gender, then that\u2019s creating a hostile environment. You don\u2019t deserve to be subjected to that just for having a hobby.", "NTA-Karma at work here.", "NTA. If she hadn't chosen a sexually charged song for you to dance to I would've sat y t a, but she got the same energy back that she gave. She doesn't get to humiliate someone and then cry foul when they play that game too. \n\nIt's very close to  E S H, though, because it's like... justified assholery, but I like people standing up to bullies", "NTA. turnabout is fair play.", "INFO: what song did she \u201cmake\u201d you dance to?", "NTA\u2026 WAP seems like a gift in that it\u2019s a great song to dance to. And based on her choice for you, its reasonable to assume she\u2019s not deeply uncomfortable with suggestive songs. It does seem like the dance studio should give folks the option to skip sexually suggestive songs they aren\u2019t comfortable with though.", "NTA. You followed the rules of the competition and didn\u2019t deliberately pick something that would make her uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019d even argue that her behaviour had indicated to you she was comfortable with sexually charged songs, otherwise what reason could she have had for choosing on for you? If she doesn\u2019t like them, and they make her feel uncomfortable, what possible reason could she have for choosing such a song for someone else? \n\nSounds like a bit of projection: she was deliberately nasty to you and so she assumes that was your goal too.", "ESH both you were AHs to each other.  Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.", "NTA - It was a random song. If she wants a career in dancing, she better learn how to dance to all types of music unless she is talented enough to pick and choose paying gigs.", "ESH. Sorry are you both 8?", "NTA - she knew the rules, and that any song could come up. Princess could dish it out, but couldn't take it. Next time pick a song by The Hu - Mongolian metal band.", "NTA\n\nThis is one of those 'fuck around and find out' situations, She finally found out.", "NTA. She chose a sexually charged song to intentionally sabotage, you let a random generator do it and karma did its thing. They're not the same.", "Nta. \n\n If you can't take the teasing, then you should tease with others.", "ESH. You both suck, and you explain why. You know you both suck.", "NAH Is this a dance competition or a miming competition? Why the would the lyrics being sexual even matter?", "NTA\n\nYou, following the rules of the contest, **randomly** picked a song.  It was extremely sexual.  And she was very uncomfortable.\n\nBut, she had no problem **deliberately** picking a sexual, feminine song for you.  To try to sabotage you.\n\nShe is 100% the AH here.  She can dish it out but can't take it, clearly.  If she doesn't want you picking random songs, she shouldn't try to sabotage you deliberately.", "NTA. Don't give what you can't take.", "Um, the competition organizers are the AHs for having that song as one of the options, wtf?", "NTA, you didn't make the playlist or even choose the song, or force her to do anything, and she did the exact same thing to you first - absolutely fair", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
