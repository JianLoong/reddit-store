It was our parents house and we both inherited it after they died. We have equal share/ownership of the house. \nThe house has four bedrooms, one is the master room and has an ensuite and walk in wardrobe, the others three just have built-in robes. \nWhen we both moved back in after deciding that neither of us wanted to sell, we agreed that she could have the master suite, but the two largest of the other bedrooms would both be mine. One as an actual bedroom and the other as a gaming room for me. The last and smallest bedroom is a guest room.\n\nHer boyfriend\u2019s been living here for a while and she recently told me that she\u2019s pregnant. I\u2019m not particularly looking forward to sharing a house with a screaming baby, but it\u2019s her house too and she has every right to be here and raise her kid. \n\nObviously, they baby will need a bedroom, and I was expecting that to be the guest room. It is the smallest bedroom in the house, but it\u2019s still the same size as a standard bedroom. But my sister wouldn\u2019t go for that. She\u2019s insisting I move my stuff out of my games room so that can be that baby\u2019s room. I told her that I\u2019m not moving my stuff into the guest room, because that wasn\u2019t our agreement, but then she informed me that actually, I won\u2019t be able to do that either, as we would still need a guest room, especially with the baby coming as her bf\u2019s family will want to visit. \n\nSo I said fine, you can have my games room, if you move into my room and give me the master room. She started crying and said that as a mother, she\u2019s going to need her own space and she deserves the master bedroom. I asked what she expected me to do, and she said I should just suck it up and keep \u2018all my crap\u2019 in my own room. \n\nWe\u2019re at an impasse and I can\u2019t get her to come to a real agreement with me. She keeps calling me a \u2018huge bitch\u2019 and says that I should let her have both the master bedroom and my gaming room because she \u2018needs them more\u2019 her boyfriend says I should just deal with it, that because I don\u2019t want kids anyway, I should just let suck it up. My girlfriend, who also spends a lot of time here, is on my side and says my sister is being a spoiled entitled little brat. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683611093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cgu71/aita_for_insisting_my_pregnant_sister_switch/", "score": 738, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s doing a slow take over and it will only get worse (especially if she has more kids). Have you ever discussed her buying out your share? Or honestly just selling and getting your own home?", "NTA. Do not under any circumstances give up your gaming room or else they\u2019re going to try and move you out of that house.\n\nTell her to take the guest room and make it an even 2 bedrooms for each. The boyfriend\u2019s family can sleep on the sofa or they can go to a hotel. You own half of the house, not him.", "NTA. Being pregnant doesn't entitle her to start land grabbing and hoarding rooms for herself and baby and bf. If she wants more than 50% of the house then she can offer you financial compensation for it - there are multiple forms that could take - or you could buy her out and she can scram.", "Sister gets one or the other but not both. \n\nTime to either buy out, be bought out, or sell outright. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd as much as it may suck, I would really recommend you sell the home and get your shares worth. She can't just change the terms of the agreement and declare ownership of more than half of the home.", "NTA. But this will only get worse when the baby you don\u2019t want around arrives. Sell the house. Split the profits. Go your separate ways and then hopefully you can retain a relationship with your sister", "Nta\n\nIf I were you I'd look at uncoupling lives from your sister and ending the 50/50 living together.\n\nShe has started using her child as a weapon to worsen your life. You don't want to live with her long term.", "NTA\n\nBoth your solutions are reasonable. \n\nOne sibling gets the largest and smallest room, the other one gets the middle sized rooms. \n\nYou could also offer to let her buy you out.", "NTA - Just because your sister has had a material change in her circumstances does not mean she gets to decide to relegate you to ONE of the four bedrooms. Your alternative solution was reasonable and worth considering. You are at an impasse because your sister is struggling with fairness. Her partner needs to zip it. He\u2019s not an owner and gets no vote.\n\nMy recommendation is to you is to get clear regarding property law in your state. It sounds like if you all cannot figure this out you\u2019ll need to be clear about whether you can force the sale of the property. Clarity there may help your sister with her decision, especially if she and her boyfriend would struggle to find housing if you decided the best thing to do is sell the house. It\u2019s a lot easier to switch bedrooms than it is to find a new home.", "NTA you already gave her the larger room and she will probably keep baby nearby initially in a crib/place next to her. \nShe has become a bit entitled. Yes you have two rooms and you could potentially downside but she's not giving you a chance to rearrange or discuss things with you. \nIf you want to continue to live here, you have to discuss everything or she can buy you out.", "NTA.   \nShe doesn\u2019t get control of all the turf, this isn\u2019t the game Risk where she can form alliances, bully and bluff her way into territory, and throw the board at hte end of the game if she doesn\u2019t win. \n\n  \nShe\u2019s not being reasonable, and if she\u2019s this unreasonable now, I suspect you are best to work out how to get out of hte house and have her pay you for the pleasure of having it all to herself. It\u2019s highly unlikely to improve from here :/", "NTA. 50%/equal ownership is just that. It seems more than equitable that one gets the largest & smallest room, the other the 2 mid sized rooms, with all other spaces shared. She chose to give up \"her\" guest room when she created a being that will inhabit that space.", "Sell ASAP!!! \n\nThis is only going to get worse from here. Get a real estate and bank appraisal, tell her to either refinance and buy out your 50%, or you can both sell. \nIf she refused you have the right to take her to court where a judge will force her to do the same.", "NTA. What next, you have to move out so the child can have a playroom? Sounds like she\u2019s trying to force you out.", "NTA you're doing all the compromising here and your sister needs to do her fair share. The only other option is that she buys you out of your 50% share and you move out with enough for a deposit on your own place. Somehow i doubt sis will go for this as she seems to be the type that expects everything to go her way", "NTA. \n\nShe can either compromise and coexist as a respectful co owner or you can force the sale of the house and you each walk away with your share to do what you will. \n\nJust because she's having a baby doesn't mean she gets more say in the decisions in the home or has a bigger share. She's basically commandeering 3 of the 4 bedrooms, while moving in her bf, adding the baby and then all the in laws who will be oh so excited to have a room available to be around the baby.", "NTA She should use the guest room, and if BF's family visit, they can get a hotel room.", "NTA. Your solution seems to be a reasonable one. . Adding one child to the equation has upset the balance you had. Imagine the strife if another comes along.\n\nWhat would be better is for one of you to buy out the other's share of the house, or sell it and split the proceeds", "NTA, you guys had an agreement prior to moving in, why would that change in the event of a pregnancy? Your sister doesn't seem to want to be fair, if you did dwindle your share to just one bedroom (and half a guest room I guess), could you see your sister eventually trying to convince you to move out so that she can have a home for her family? Is she the type that would guilt you into leaving the house for her once the baby is present? Where is line drawn exactly? I know I'm probably being over dramatic, but it's not uncommon for family to go a little nuts when money or property gets passed down. If the house was left to you two equally, then it needs to either be shared equally, or your sister should buy out your half.", "NTA she doesn't get to change the living agreement because she got knocked up. She can either give up the guest room, keep the kid in her room, trade rooms with you or try and buy you out", "Get yourselves ten wives or husbands or cats or dogs and then say they each need their own space and cry as well if she refuses to agree to it.\n\nClearly nta", "NTA. Time to sell", "NTA. If she can't afford to buy you out, or you don't want to be bought out because you want to keep it as an investment, you could suggest to her that you move out and rent your 50% (2 of the 4 bedrooms) to a stranger. She might change her mind then.", "Nta but this arrangement clearly isn\u2019t working for either of you", "Nta but sell the house, your sister is playing games with you. It may take time but ultimately she will make you so miserable to be in that house as she will see you as an interloper who is living with her family.", "NTA.  It's time to buy her out or for her to buy you out, if neither of those can hapoen, then sell the house and you get 50% each.  She is trying to take over the whole house and make you uncomfortable living there.", "You all need to sell the house or she needs to buy you out. I wouldn't want to live with a pregnant asshole or her boyfriend or host his family or any of this. It's all her problem. NTA. I'd want out before she gets married anyway.", "NTA. she cant have it both ways. she\u2019s selfish.", "NTA but you need a written contract about the division of space in the house with both of you in it. I say this because as much as I feel sympathy for people having kids you as an individual stand a very good chance of being slowly but surely forced out of the house altogether by their growing family in a few years time. You need to sit down with your sister and be realistic about the situation- is this boyfriend a serious long-term relationship? Is this baby #1 of potentially several? How do they plan to accommodate for the child's growth? Even if they take one of your rooms from you what happens if they have a second child? Does that child get the guest bedroom or are they going to start pushing you to leave the house? \n\nAnd, if the two of you can't continue to both co-exist in this space with the ideal amount of room long-term, what is the compensation plan for one of you moving out/surrendering your rights to the space (and yes, there should be one! It's not realistic to expect that both of you will be able to live there together forever with changing lives and families- but the person who moves out should be owed some kind of share in the property loss they experience by doing so)?", "NTA. It seems pretty apparent that your sister and her BF feel entitled to the entire house, despite the fact you are a co-owner. I think the best thing you can do is tell your sister you want to sell the house, and the two of you can split the proceeds. Then she can live where and how she wants, and so can you.", "NTA.  If she insists, I would tell her that you would like to sell the house then to get your equal share and see if she changes her tune.  Your suggestion is perfectly reasonable \u2014 you had a deal.", "nta, but please clarify what \" We have equal share/ownership of the house\" means.", "NTA - it's time to sell.", "NTA. Nope. Tell her you\u2019re selling the house. She can buy you out or it goes on the open market. Or you can buy her out. She has no more right to it than you do and her boyfriend gets zero says. He should just be happy to be there.", "NTA She wants to take over the house! I bet you also won't be able to use the guest room because bfs family is always here, i wouldn't be surprised if they nearly move in at leadt for some months. Look your doors! I can see her moving all the stuff out of the room when you are out of your house.", "NTA, but it might be time to force a sale (or have your sister buy you out). This is going to get worse until it\u2019s an all-out war zone full of passive aggressiveness and baby poop.", "NTA. Her 'equal share' is just that. It doesn't change based on her needs. If anyone's needs outgrows their share, they should pay rent to use the other's space or move out and get their own place.", "NTA. Things would be different if your parents still owned the house and could reallocate space according to changing needs. It's not a family home but instead it's a shared home. You own 50%, and you have a right to equal use of the home. Your sister's changing needs do not change your rights. I also think that your counteroffer was reasonable since it wasn't fair for her to expect you to give up something with nothing in return.\n\nThat said, I don't see this situation being able to continue. Her housing needs are growing, and the house isn't getting any bigger. At some point soon, one of you is going to need to move out and either have their share bought out by the other or get paid partial rent for their share of the house. Or maybe you'll both need to move out so that you can sell the house and use the money to buy your own separate spaces.", "NTA, you both inherited that house. Regardless of her circumstances what she does with her agreed half is not your problem. If you give up your room now then later it'll be \" OP should move out, and suck it up\".", "NTA. You offered multiple suggestions which were reasonable and fair. She offered a single solution that would only benefit her. Which means she isn\u2019t trying to negotiate, she is being a bully, and is trying to get rid of you.\n\nHonestly it was a bit of a fantasy to think that this would all end well, but don\u2019t let her write you out of the story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would tell her to buy you out and peace out", "NTA. you\u2019re being perfectly reasonable by trying to compromise. she\u2019s not willing to do that, and that\u2019s the only way a partnership works. if she doesn\u2019t like it then she can either find her own place to raise her kids or buy out your share.", "NTA, wow OP your sister is trying to treat half of her house as all of her house. Get locks for those doors and firmly say she either buys you out of your half of the house or you get the master room and she gets the other 2 smaller rooms and the other room remain a guest room. She is definitely trying to take over the house", "Please stand your ground, I\u2019m fairly sure she is pushing you out slowly so she can have her perfect household in her own perfect house. Maybe start inviting some friends over who stay later (petty I know but well). \nNTA", "Question, do you split all the bills? Split then 3 ways cause the bf lives there?", "NTA. As much as your attitude towards babies makes me want to slap you, your sister is being entitled. Name your price for a buyout, offer to buy her out or threaten to force sale asap. \n\nOnce babies start living there, you'll have a nightmare in court.", "NTA, also tell the boyfriend to go to hell. He has zero say.", "Your request is fair. And I also agree she\u2019s taking over and you need to look into a buy out or y\u2019all selling the home. This is going to get messy. But stand your ground! She needs to give up the main bedroom. Don\u2019t budge! And don\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty for choosing to NOT be a mother. She made the choice to have kids not you so her choice shouldn\u2019t inconvenience you.", "NTA Your parents left the house to both of you. You\u2019re willing to give her the guest room and that\u2019s it that\u2019s more than fair. Lock up your other two rooms. If you give in she will eventually move you out of your house. I don\u2019t know your sister and I\u2019m not trying to cast her in a bad light but this is what it seems like to me. As for her boyfriend he can go mind his own business. This is between you and your sister.", "How about one of you buys the other out and the other goes and buys their own house.", "NTA if I were you I would have her buy me out and buy my own place. It\u2019s not a realistic set up. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up your space and shouldn\u2019t have to live with a family. Your sister is demanding more than her share because she is pregnant. Not your problem", "NTA but this living situation is untenable. How do you think this is going to end up? In the best possible scenario? Even assuming you get to keep your rooms etc. Are you and your girlfriend going to end up living there alongside your sister and her boyfriend and kid (which will likely become kids plural). I don't think that in a 4 bedroom house two couples plus children can coexist without a lot of tension and friction.", "Definitely NTA. OP needs to establish clear boundaries. At what point does your sister need your room for later children? Essentially she is on a path to take over the whole house. I'd suggest either establish clear boundaries about how the space is spilt evenly or ask your sister to buy you out. \n\nPersonally I'd have a conversation along the lines of I'm keeping my 2 rooms as they are or you can buy me out and I'll leave the house entirely. I'm not sure how the legalities will work where you are.", "She needs to tell her sister anyone else living in the house needs to pay rent. \n\nHer boyfriend had to pay x amount to both of them, the sister can waive her fee", ">She\u2019s doing a slow take over \n\nDitto this. With baby on the way, it's only going to get worse. She needs to buy out your share or you both need to sell up --- preferably before the baby arrives. The situation will only get worse over time.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, this. OP, the arrangement worked when both of you were in the same life stage and had compatible lifestyles. Each having equal amounts of space to do whatever you want with (she has the biggest and smallest bedrooms while you have the two medium bedrooms) was a very fair interpretation of your equal shares in the house. But now your sister is trying to move towards an interpretation of fair that involves each person in the house having the same right to a bedroom, regardless of the proportion of the house each owns - and that disenfranchises you from the house that you are co-owner of.\n\nAt this point, you're no longer compatible housemates, and the only real options you have are: agree to sell the house and split the money, agree to be bought out of your share of the house by your sister/her boyfriend/both, or sadly, take it to court to force the sale so that you can recover your equity and find somewhere else to live. \n\nBecause in the long term, staying and becoming a second-class citizen in your own home - your opinions discounted at every turn because you haven't got a child - is not a workable option.", "The advice suggests selling a property as soon as possible, obtaining a real estate and bank appraisal, and offering the co-owner the option to refinance and buy out the other's share or sell the property. If they refuse, legal action may be taken.", "She shouldn't even be willing to speak to the boyfriend about this. It's none of his business", "Is the bf paying rent to op? She could just rent her space to ops boyfriend and family to cover the inconvenience. If I were op, I\u2019d make sure the ownership is watertight between her and sis only with no option for boyfriend to get ownership, then I\u2019d rent ops half to the boyfriend and family. Move out and use the equity in the place to get her own pace if this were possible.", "Honestly, I think that's a really great solution for you to buy her out. Then she'll have all sorts of her own space! Idk about your area, but where I'm at right now, it's a buyer's market. And she'll have bf to help her out, in theory.", "This situation is not going to last long term anyway, might as well offer to buy her out now or at least as soon as you possibly can. If you do it now you could still salvage your relationship with her, but if you let it fester too long you might end up hating eachother even when you finally start living apart.", "do that! it\u2019s your home just as much as it is hers! and i hope that the rent is divided in 3 and you all are paying equally!", "If they can't afford to buy you out, an alternative option might be for her and bf to rent the house from you (paying 50% of fair market rent for a house that size). \n\nThat way they get all the room they want and you can use the rent and your savings to buy another place or rent one that is sized better for your living style.\n\nIf your sister is that entitled, she may try to pull crap on paying the rent though. Not ideal to be renting to a family member and it gets messier when you can't really evict them. If you go this route, it would be worth talking to a lawyer about how to best structure the agreement so that you have some leverage in making them pay rent consistently.", "Surely she could get a mortgage to buy out your half if she wanted to? She just wants a free house. Don\u2019t let her bully you.", "That's awesome that *one* of you is in a financial position to be able to buy out the other - the house can stay in the family, and there's no arguing over who gets the 'right' to buy it (as she isn't in a position to).\n\nThe division of largest+smallest vs middle two bedrooms is absolutely fair and equitable, and you should stand your ground on that.\n\nI'd very much talk up what an opportunity it is for her, her partner, and her child to be to have their own home and own space - a natural progression from two siblings sharing a home and living space, to both having their own place.\n\nYou're NTA and I hope this moves towards a zero assholes, happy people in their own places, situation.", "Unfortunately this is probably your only real solution. Also if she keeps letting her boyfriend stay over and make demands well then you need to insist he can\u2019t come over as much etc. It sounds like she wants the house but knows she can\u2019t afford it so her and her bf are trying to push you out. Stand your ground and every time she is unreasonable push back and don\u2019t have to her I am a mother stuff\u2026.. If she needs her own space that badly she shouldn\u2019t have had a kid.", "Exactly. Or buy them a blow up mattress for the living room. Ops sister is definitely trying to take advantage with the pregnancy. I would not be surprised if she insisted that the sister just let her have the house because she has her own little family now.", "OP should also habe a say whether her sisters boyfriends family is allowed to visit or not!", "What kind of backward logic is this?\n\nNTA, you were happy with the way things were before. Your sister understandably needs more space in the house, but it is not hers to take, and she is demanding you simply give it over. You made an offer, and she turned it down. Conversation seems to be pretty much over unless she can make a counter offer that you would agree to.", "Sister's 'needs' don't trump OP's co-ownership of the house. Either sis keeps the main bedroom and OP gets the other 2 or they can keep the baby in their room. Not fair to ask OP to move, but sister might need to especially if she plans on having more children.", "What makes her need the ensuite more than OP?", "> She started crying and said that as a mother, she\u2019s going to need her own space and she deserves the master bedroom.\n\nIs her sister giving birth to a baby or a martyrdom complex? A lot of my friends are new parents, but none of them have this level of ridiculous entitlement. From what I have seen, being a parent is difficult but expecting to be rewarded for having sex sans condom is ridiculous.", "This definately! \nI am sure that OP will come home one day with her stuff removed from her gameroom. \nAnd I know how expensive those gamin equipment are and how careful it needs to be handled. \nI predict a hostile takeover without a lock with some broken equipment.", "Op needs to stand her ground on this one. At the moment it's 2 against one. Move her gf in and keep 2nd room.", "Or the sister will consider her a live in babysitter. \n\nOP needs to sell her half and get outta dodge NOW. \n\nNTA", "Then op gets disturbed sleep and sister gets a nice peaceful night, its a win win /s", "\"Oh the baby is crying all night? \n\nI hadn't really heard since I sleep so far away. \n\nBut while you're so close and already awake anyway, you wouldn't mind nursing the baby back to sleep would you?\" \n\n\\- this is gonna happen every week", "Current guidance is for baby to sleep in with mom for 6 months anyway, something to do with synchronising and breathing and preventing SIDS", "My guess is baby daddy isn't going to be an issue in a year or two.\n\nSource: I've read a few other posts here", "This! The longer you leave it, the more unreasonable she might get and refuse to sell at all. New babies are hard, you\u2019re hormonal, exhausted and very unlikely to want to add a house move on top of all that. Talking to her now gives them time to find a place and get settled before the baby comes and hopefully avoids any further friction between the two of you.", "Easily, this!\n\nOP: most mortgages require around 20% equity as a down payment. Sister would only need the cash for 50% of the house so she should be able to get a very good mortgage rate.\n\nThis deal would be equivalent to her going to the bank for a mortgage with a 50% down payment (assuming she puts in no cash).\n\nIf she even has 10%-20% of the value in cash she may be approaching the home equity line of credit territory and wouldn\u2019t even need to secure the loan against the title.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t want the risk of her defaulting on a loan leading to the house being owned by a bank, you can even work with a lawyer to offer financing yourself.\n\nIn this circumstance, a lawyer draws up a contract where she pays you a monthly amount and in event of default you can claim ownership.\n\nI\u2019d suggest bank mortgage, taking the cash and washing your hands of it, but I can understand other options with the sentimentality.", "Yeah i get that but thats not how life works, nothing is ever 50 50 and if you keep pushing it all you will get is resentment, think about bigger picture here.", "I am a new parent (and also have a stepchild). We have a 2 bedroom house. My stepson has his own room. The baby sleeps with us because that is recommended for at least the first 6 months. And also very useful because you don\u2019t need to wonder if the sound is something you have to get out of bed for. You are able to just look. \n\nAnd I agree it is entitlement. Babies don\u2019t need their own room and can do without it for the first 1-2 years. Then the child can move into the smaller guest room. \n\nAnd about the own space.. that is probably not going to happen for a while and when it does you are fine with just a chair in the bathroom or having 10 minutes for yourself on the toilet. I have my \u201cme time\u201d when he sleeps.", "She may have wanted to have a baby though, we don\u2019t know that but sans that thought, this is absolutely ridiculous. I know I am going to get downvoted for this but a lot of parents and definitely most of the ones that we hear posts on  seem to want the bragging rights of having children but none of the responsibility. Having children has wonderful gains and beauty and it also involves sacrifice but no one wants that responsibility, its all I need me time, babysitters- even when you\u2019re available. Its really sad that people won\u2019t accept all of the responsibilities that parenthood entails.", "What's the alternative if the house is all there is? Will it to just one of them? Sounds disappointing for the other(s).", "OP\u2019s sister can certainly make living in the home unbearable.  OP might be able to create legal consequences for that if she goes far enough, but that\u2019s going to be a hard road.\n\nBoth of them probably have the legal right to force a home sale if the other is unwilling to buy them out.", "Whether the sister can force her to live in fewer rooms really depends on the structure under which they inherited the house. Just because Opie owns 50% of the house, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a court would uphold her right to occupy exactly 50% of the square footage. If it ends up in court, it\u2019s likely that the court would force a partition sale, which would be more expensive, and yield less profit, for both of them than just agreeing to sell the place and split the proceeds.", "I think that the sister doesn't care about what is legal or not - and is trying really hard to convince OP to give up to her inheritance. She'll use all the flying monkeys she can to do this. Once OP is out, i doubt that OP will sue her because she's too good of a person. Guilt tripping OP into not letting the pregnant sister \"homeless\" and bs like this can do much harm to a good soul.", "Or get the op to do overnight childcare."]}
