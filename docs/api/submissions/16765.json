It was our parents house and we both inherited it after they died. We have equal share/ownership of the house. \nThe house has four bedrooms, one is the master room and has an ensuite and walk in wardrobe, the others three just have built-in robes. \nWhen we both moved back in after deciding that neither of us wanted to sell, we agreed that she could have the master suite, but the two largest of the other bedrooms would both be mine. One as an actual bedroom and the other as a gaming room for me. The last and smallest bedroom is a guest room.\n\nHer boyfriend\u2019s been living here for a while and she recently told me that she\u2019s pregnant. I\u2019m not particularly looking forward to sharing a house with a screaming baby, but it\u2019s her house too and she has every right to be here and raise her kid. \n\nObviously, they baby will need a bedroom, and I was expecting that to be the guest room. It is the smallest bedroom in the house, but it\u2019s still the same size as a standard bedroom. But my sister wouldn\u2019t go for that. She\u2019s insisting I move my stuff out of my games room so that can be that baby\u2019s room. I told her that I\u2019m not moving my stuff into the guest room, because that wasn\u2019t our agreement, but then she informed me that actually, I won\u2019t be able to do that either, as we would still need a guest room, especially with the baby coming as her bf\u2019s family will want to visit. \n\nSo I said fine, you can have my games room, if you move into my room and give me the master room. She started crying and said that as a mother, she\u2019s going to need her own space and she deserves the master bedroom. I asked what she expected me to do, and she said I should just suck it up and keep \u2018all my crap\u2019 in my own room. \n\nWe\u2019re at an impasse and I can\u2019t get her to come to a real agreement with me. She keeps calling me a \u2018huge bitch\u2019 and says that I should let her have both the master bedroom and my gaming room because she \u2018needs them more\u2019 her boyfriend says I should just deal with it, that because I don\u2019t want kids anyway, I should just let suck it up. My girlfriend, who also spends a lot of time here, is on my side and says my sister is being a spoiled entitled little brat. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683611093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cgu71/aita_for_insisting_my_pregnant_sister_switch/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s doing a slow take over and it will only get worse (especially if she has more kids). Have you ever discussed her buying out your share? Or honestly just selling and getting your own home?", "NTA. Do not under any circumstances give up your gaming room or else they\u2019re going to try and move you out of that house.\n\nTell her to take the guest room and make it an even 2 bedrooms for each. The boyfriend\u2019s family can sleep on the sofa or they can go to a hotel. You own half of the house, not him.", "NTA. Being pregnant doesn't entitle her to start land grabbing and hoarding rooms for herself and baby and bf. If she wants more than 50% of the house then she can offer you financial compensation for it - there are multiple forms that could take - or you could buy her out and she can scram.", "Sister gets one or the other but not both. \n\nTime to either buy out, be bought out, or sell outright. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd as much as it may suck, I would really recommend you sell the home and get your shares worth. She can't just change the terms of the agreement and declare ownership of more than half of the home.", "NTA. But this will only get worse when the baby you don\u2019t want around arrives. Sell the house. Split the profits. Go your separate ways and then hopefully you can retain a relationship with your sister", "Nta\n\nIf I were you I'd look at uncoupling lives from your sister and ending the 50/50 living together.\n\nShe has started using her child as a weapon to worsen your life. You don't want to live with her long term.", "NTA\n\nBoth your solutions are reasonable. \n\nOne sibling gets the largest and smallest room, the other one gets the middle sized rooms. \n\nYou could also offer to let her buy you out.", "NTA - Just because your sister has had a material change in her circumstances does not mean she gets to decide to relegate you to ONE of the four bedrooms. Your alternative solution was reasonable and worth considering. You are at an impasse because your sister is struggling with fairness. Her partner needs to zip it. He\u2019s not an owner and gets no vote.\n\nMy recommendation is to you is to get clear regarding property law in your state. It sounds like if you all cannot figure this out you\u2019ll need to be clear about whether you can force the sale of the property. Clarity there may help your sister with her decision, especially if she and her boyfriend would struggle to find housing if you decided the best thing to do is sell the house. It\u2019s a lot easier to switch bedrooms than it is to find a new home.", "NTA you already gave her the larger room and she will probably keep baby nearby initially in a crib/place next to her. \nShe has become a bit entitled. Yes you have two rooms and you could potentially downside but she's not giving you a chance to rearrange or discuss things with you. \nIf you want to continue to live here, you have to discuss everything or she can buy you out.", "NTA.   \nShe doesn\u2019t get control of all the turf, this isn\u2019t the game Risk where she can form alliances, bully and bluff her way into territory, and throw the board at hte end of the game if she doesn\u2019t win. \n\n  \nShe\u2019s not being reasonable, and if she\u2019s this unreasonable now, I suspect you are best to work out how to get out of hte house and have her pay you for the pleasure of having it all to herself. It\u2019s highly unlikely to improve from here :/", "NTA. 50%/equal ownership is just that. It seems more than equitable that one gets the largest & smallest room, the other the 2 mid sized rooms, with all other spaces shared. She chose to give up \"her\" guest room when she created a being that will inhabit that space.", "Sell ASAP!!! \n\nThis is only going to get worse from here. Get a real estate and bank appraisal, tell her to either refinance and buy out your 50%, or you can both sell. \nIf she refused you have the right to take her to court where a judge will force her to do the same.", "NTA. What next, you have to move out so the child can have a playroom? Sounds like she\u2019s trying to force you out.", "NTA you're doing all the compromising here and your sister needs to do her fair share. The only other option is that she buys you out of your 50% share and you move out with enough for a deposit on your own place. Somehow i doubt sis will go for this as she seems to be the type that expects everything to go her way", "NTA. \n\nShe can either compromise and coexist as a respectful co owner or you can force the sale of the house and you each walk away with your share to do what you will. \n\nJust because she's having a baby doesn't mean she gets more say in the decisions in the home or has a bigger share. She's basically commandeering 3 of the 4 bedrooms, while moving in her bf, adding the baby and then all the in laws who will be oh so excited to have a room available to be around the baby.", "NTA She should use the guest room, and if BF's family visit, they can get a hotel room.", "NTA. Your solution seems to be a reasonable one. . Adding one child to the equation has upset the balance you had. Imagine the strife if another comes along.\n\nWhat would be better is for one of you to buy out the other's share of the house, or sell it and split the proceeds", "NTA, you guys had an agreement prior to moving in, why would that change in the event of a pregnancy? Your sister doesn't seem to want to be fair, if you did dwindle your share to just one bedroom (and half a guest room I guess), could you see your sister eventually trying to convince you to move out so that she can have a home for her family? Is she the type that would guilt you into leaving the house for her once the baby is present? Where is line drawn exactly? I know I'm probably being over dramatic, but it's not uncommon for family to go a little nuts when money or property gets passed down. If the house was left to you two equally, then it needs to either be shared equally, or your sister should buy out your half.", "NTA she doesn't get to change the living agreement because she got knocked up. She can either give up the guest room, keep the kid in her room, trade rooms with you or try and buy you out", "Get yourselves ten wives or husbands or cats or dogs and then say they each need their own space and cry as well if she refuses to agree to it.\n\nClearly nta", "NTA. Time to sell", "NTA. If she can't afford to buy you out, or you don't want to be bought out because you want to keep it as an investment, you could suggest to her that you move out and rent your 50% (2 of the 4 bedrooms) to a stranger. She might change her mind then.", "Nta but this arrangement clearly isn\u2019t working for either of you", "Nta but sell the house, your sister is playing games with you. It may take time but ultimately she will make you so miserable to be in that house as she will see you as an interloper who is living with her family.", "NTA.  It's time to buy her out or for her to buy you out, if neither of those can hapoen, then sell the house and you get 50% each.  She is trying to take over the whole house and make you uncomfortable living there.", "You all need to sell the house or she needs to buy you out. I wouldn't want to live with a pregnant asshole or her boyfriend or host his family or any of this. It's all her problem. NTA. I'd want out before she gets married anyway.", "NTA. she cant have it both ways. she\u2019s selfish.", "NTA but you need a written contract about the division of space in the house with both of you in it. I say this because as much as I feel sympathy for people having kids you as an individual stand a very good chance of being slowly but surely forced out of the house altogether by their growing family in a few years time. You need to sit down with your sister and be realistic about the situation- is this boyfriend a serious long-term relationship? Is this baby #1 of potentially several? How do they plan to accommodate for the child's growth? Even if they take one of your rooms from you what happens if they have a second child? Does that child get the guest bedroom or are they going to start pushing you to leave the house? \n\nAnd, if the two of you can't continue to both co-exist in this space with the ideal amount of room long-term, what is the compensation plan for one of you moving out/surrendering your rights to the space (and yes, there should be one! It's not realistic to expect that both of you will be able to live there together forever with changing lives and families- but the person who moves out should be owed some kind of share in the property loss they experience by doing so)?", "NTA. It seems pretty apparent that your sister and her BF feel entitled to the entire house, despite the fact you are a co-owner. I think the best thing you can do is tell your sister you want to sell the house, and the two of you can split the proceeds. Then she can live where and how she wants, and so can you.", "NTA.  If she insists, I would tell her that you would like to sell the house then to get your equal share and see if she changes her tune.  Your suggestion is perfectly reasonable \u2014 you had a deal.", "nta, but please clarify what \" We have equal share/ownership of the house\" means.", "NTA - it's time to sell.", "NTA. Nope. Tell her you\u2019re selling the house. She can buy you out or it goes on the open market. Or you can buy her out. She has no more right to it than you do and her boyfriend gets zero says. He should just be happy to be there.", "NTA She wants to take over the house! I bet you also won't be able to use the guest room because bfs family is always here, i wouldn't be surprised if they nearly move in at leadt for some months. Look your doors! I can see her moving all the stuff out of the room when you are out of your house.", "NTA, but it might be time to force a sale (or have your sister buy you out). This is going to get worse until it\u2019s an all-out war zone full of passive aggressiveness and baby poop.", "NTA. Her 'equal share' is just that. It doesn't change based on her needs. If anyone's needs outgrows their share, they should pay rent to use the other's space or move out and get their own place.", "NTA. Things would be different if your parents still owned the house and could reallocate space according to changing needs. It's not a family home but instead it's a shared home. You own 50%, and you have a right to equal use of the home. Your sister's changing needs do not change your rights. I also think that your counteroffer was reasonable since it wasn't fair for her to expect you to give up something with nothing in return.\n\nThat said, I don't see this situation being able to continue. Her housing needs are growing, and the house isn't getting any bigger. At some point soon, one of you is going to need to move out and either have their share bought out by the other or get paid partial rent for their share of the house. Or maybe you'll both need to move out so that you can sell the house and use the money to buy your own separate spaces.", "NTA, you both inherited that house. Regardless of her circumstances what she does with her agreed half is not your problem. If you give up your room now then later it'll be \" OP should move out, and suck it up\".", "NTA. You offered multiple suggestions which were reasonable and fair. She offered a single solution that would only benefit her. Which means she isn\u2019t trying to negotiate, she is being a bully, and is trying to get rid of you.\n\nHonestly it was a bit of a fantasy to think that this would all end well, but don\u2019t let her write you out of the story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it\u2019d be best for you two to live in separate homes", "Yeah\u2026there is zero way this is going to w continue working. \nSis had made the first move in a takeover, she\u2019s not going to sit back and let OP \u201cwin\u201d. It\u2019s going to be the start of endless battles. \n\nOne needs to buy the other out, or they need to sell it and split the profits at this point. Before things get bad.", "\n>My recommendation is to you is to get clear regarding property law in your state\n\nEspecially before baby daddy becomes brother in law and complicates ownership even more", "My gut is also saying this.", "Get two appraisals. Always good to have a second opinion. And yeah sell now she might not stop and this'll obviously have an effect on your relationship.", "if BF's family visit, they can get a hotel room.", "Yep. Careful, OP, or you'll get squeezed out of your inheritance.", "No she won't, she'll say okay, then pull rank as the owner/occupier to gradually squeeze the tenant out of the space and/or make their life miserable until they move out. Then she will be living in OP's home and OP will be paying rent somewhere and find it impossible to move back in.", "If the property was split 50/50 on inheritance, they have shared ownership of the actual property and real assets within it.  That is, on the title, on the taxes, on everything. \n\nIn order for either sister here to have full control of what they want to do with these rooms they would have to 'buy out' the title value of the other sisters half.  Which for a 4 bedroom house is... Well.  Property market is up and that's going to be a lot of fucking money even paying for half the house.\n\nBasically they already entered into agreement on whose rooms were who's.  She actually can't force her to give up those rooms so she's just trying to bully her out.", "She can't kick her out.  She has just as much legal right to the property.  If the sister did change the locks and tried to deny her, that would be some major legal issues.  Like, big money legal issues.\n\nThey entered into agreement that she had those two rooms.  That's it.  Sister can't actually force her out, or take the rooms without incurring civil damages.", "I was thinking they need to sell too, because the sister is totally going to force OP to move out at some point so her family can have the entire house to themself.\n\nThis is the problem with parents willing a house to be split equally amongst siblings. At some point one or more will need to be bought out by one person.", "Seems like slow way to get OP out of the home.", "Bank and real estate are the two you need. \nOne gives you what the bank values it at (if you were to refinance or someone were to take a loan to purchase it) and the other is a CMA (competitive market analysis)", "Good point, I hadn't thought of that."]}
