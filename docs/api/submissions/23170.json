The only consequence of her not having one was that she'd have a tantrum or possibly a meltdown (the difference being that a tantrum would be purely emotional, like any other annoyed kid . . . a meltdown would be a legitimate lashing out because she anticipated having a drink and her brain might have had difficulty \"switching tracks\" when something happened that she didn't anticipate and she couldn't process it fast enough, and got overwhelmed by the unexpected change).

Autistic people need ways to self regulate to live in the real world, and mom and dad won\u2019t always be there to shield them from it.

I spend my life with just a little bit of that feeling I can see how it would be difficult to know if it's getting serious or I'm just nervous.

Granted OP was *probably* not going to have a sugar crash in the ten minutes it took to get home, but also this was a great opportunity for the parents to work with their child on practicing patience and emotional regulation. 10 minutes is also not a long time for the kid to wait until they get home where there is (presumably) more juice.

Honestly, as an autistic person, this is setting off alarm bells for me. Things happen, but if they \\*deliberately packed\\* OJ with pulp, if pulp is a sensory issue for their daughter.....that tells me they are either deliberately ignoring sensory needs or are unaware how to properly handle them, which is unacceptable if they have been raising the child for 7 years. Ignoring your child's needs consistently  is a great way to set up your child for trust/mental health issues.\n\nNTA, OP, as you don't have any responsibility to the child in that moment, but I would keep an eye on the daughter to the extent you can.

Depending on the level of stress they're under, it can be easier or harder to follow it.\n\nYES. (also autistic)  \nWe actually really like boundaries and rules, as long as they are clear and make sense. Some of us are really \"justice sensitive\" and can't violate an internal code based on our personal sense of what is right and wrong.  \n\n\nThank you for explaining this so well!", "Thank you, it is really useful!\n\nI find this so normal that I wonder ... don't all people function like that? I might be autistic too (never diagnosed) because everything you say sounds very natural to me.", "In my experience (as an autistic person) most people do not have an internal code they can't violate, no. Not in the same way, at least.  \nFor example, I find it almost impossible to lie. I'm a terrible liar, partly because I give away how I feel about lying while trying to do it.   \nBut I find so. many. people. who think that certain \"types\" of lies are ok. White lies, for example. To me, those are still lies. Some people will say that they don't lie...and then turn around and lie. I don't understand how people can say one thing and do another thing.   \nI assume that everyone around me is telling the truth because lying is just not a thing that should be done. That assumption has hurt me, a lot.  \n\n\nAnd for the record I'm not interested in picking apart lying, lies, or whether or not I have ever lied in x situation.", "Yes, this!!\n\nDiabetes is so well managed now people forget that it has actual life and death consequences. \n\nThe juice is a medical tool, not just a drink to have. It\u2019s the exact same as having an asthma puffer in your bag.", "I think it's never too late to explain.  The parents aimed the meltdown at OP on purpose to deflect from themselves. They could have deflected from the whole meltdown by turning it into a learning experience about diabetes because its hard to melt down while you're learning something new and interesting.", "The information we were given made me think that the parents brought the juice because it was low sugar. It is their choice to raise their daughter with low/no sugar products but those options aren't much use if she is rejecting because of sensory issues. The parents need to sort out their priorities.", "I've seen exactly this being done to autistic children: entitled PARENTS use them by very deliberately steering a meltdown at someone that isn't able to help them in the way the parent demands. It's disgusting on the parent's part, manipulative, gaslighting, narcissistic and just plain gross. But NOT the kid's fault.", ">>it makes more sense than telling them no\n\nI love that you mentioned this, because I think the same goes for kids not on the spectrum as well. Telling a kid \u201cno\u201d and \u201cbecause I said so\u201d does a disservice to the kid\u2019s mental growth and critical thinking development. It might require more effort and time investment to explain the logic to the kid in the beginning, but over the long-term, it\u2019s much better for the parent and the kid, and society. I think that\u2019s one of the most crucial roles of a parent, to provide a structure of boundaries for their kids to grown up and feel confident in.", "> nothing will happen to you in the 10 minutes between now and the house\n\nOh, so they've never seen a diabetic exercise?\n\nHypoglycemia makes the person experiencing it feel awful, unable to move/function, and can be very dangerous.  Even a mellow walk can trigger it.  They wanna roll that dice because they can't deal with their own kidsthrowing a fit?\n\nHardcore NTA", "Great job raising your son! Actually I know some parents with neurotypical kids who badly need to take notes from you.", "I taught a HS junior who had ADHD. He would get up and pretend to jack off on other students. Every time I called him out, his \"mama bear\" mom came to his defense. He has ADHD, he can't help it, he has no impulse control, no I don't want to make him take his medicine... Last I heard, the kid lost a job for being crude to a customer. We are not setting kids up for success, at all."]}
