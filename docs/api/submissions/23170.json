I hope you will recover. Diabetes suck.", "NTA to the highest degree. You have a legitimate medical condition. It wpuldnt have mattered if you were 10mins from the house or 10 hours.

Plus, she needs to learn that not everything will be as she wants if she will live in society...", "NTA- Why would they pack juice that they know their daughter can\u2019t handle?

You need to take care of your own health \n\nBut definitely the asshole if there was something else you could have had in an emergency, the kids disabled, and you seem to blame her screaming on people having a bad time.

The child threw a tantrum just like any other 7 year old because they wanted what they wanted.

Everyone is different of course, but speaking as an autistic person who was previously an autistic child subject to both tantrums and meltdowns, if it really was a case of \"I want apple juice\" \"well you can't have apple juice until we get home in 10 minutes\", that seems to me more like a tantrum.
