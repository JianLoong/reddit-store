NTA.", "That\u2019s debatable. Yeah, he put a buget for himself, assuming he would only have to pay his part of the bill. But the other people all bought stuff that was way more expensive. When he found out that they were gonna split the bill, the initial budget simply wouldn\u2019t matter as it\u2019s likely would be crossed anyways thx to the other people buying the expensive shit. \n\nI\u2019ll put it into perspective. If I go out with 10 friends, and I set myself a budget of $20, but my friends all spend $40, and only after a certain while they say \u201cwe\u2019re gonna split the bill\u201d, i\u2019ll suddenly have to pay $38 instead of my planned $20. So yeah, if that\u2019s the case, i might as well just order a little bit more of an expensive dessert so that the $38 i hadn\u2019t planned on spending is actually worth it, bc the other people didn\u2019t properly comunicate how the bills will be payed. It\u2019s not my problem the end budget will be $42 a person while the rest can only pay $40. They should have considered that before ordering the expensive stuff.\n\nThese are just some random small numbers. A budget of $200 is fairly reasonable for him and his gf. If the rest goes over that budget, then you should be allowed to do so too.", "I don't see him as an AH, but I don't see him as smart either.\n\nRight response is not to order shit you don't want but to say, no, we're not splitting it other than birthday boy. I'll pay for what GF and I had, plus 1/9 of the cost of birthday boy. \n\nWhich is completely fair. They'll object. Just be perfectly calm, do the math, tell the waiter to put that, plus tax and tip, on your card. Leave.", "The final bill came up to around 1.2k not including the drinks. I only calculated how much the food cost for all of us together.", "Split it so each person pays for what they order, I don't know anyone who thinks to split it evenly regardless.", "Yes I paid for only his entree, and the rest of the stuff me and my gf ordered making me go nearly double over budget. The rest of the table only had to pay for there and his drinks, and food and deserts.", "ESH \n\nyou do the same thing you accuse them of? with the math breakdown you aren\u2019t down as bad as you make it out to be. payment should have been discussed before dinner \n\nyour group of friends are immature if y\u2019all are arguing about the bill like that, prob shouldn\u2019t have been eating there if it made you all this petty. no one classy expects and argues with others to buy them a birthday dinner", "But it will make him pay more too. So he is spending money on something he didn't want to get in first place (expensive desert) just to \"teach em a lesson\" by also paying more than whatever was going to be that was already over his budget. \n\nKeep in mind, I am saying ESH. The friends behavior is not excusable either. But if it was me, I would have approached that friend afterward and said \"Listen, I do not appreciate springing the shared bill on me at the end of the evening and when you guys were aware of it and obviously buying more than a fair share is. It was way over what I had planned to pay for the evening, but I paid it anyway. I am not paying it next time. This was very not cool. I hope that you had a happy birthday celebration, because this soured it for me.\" - both expressing your boundaries clear, that you took offense and that this behavior was not unnoticed and not accepted. And now they will have to make amends to you.", "That's what I would've done as well (except for the paying of 1/9 of the cost of the birthday boy). I often drink a cocktails when I go out with friends for dinner and we split the bill but I take off the cost of the cocktails and add them to my portion of the bill. I can't imagine doing this to someone or sitting there and allowing them to do it to me.", ">To put into perspective, me and my girlfriend bill came out to just under $200 give or take. The entire bill was nearing $800 and they still wanted to get desert.  \n>  \n>And yes it was 10 people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, at this point of the meal, you were 20% of the people, and 25% of the bill, so you were MORE than your fair share of the bill. This is also when you claim you find out you are splitting the cheque. To be clear, at this point you were $100/person, and the other 8 were $75/person, but you would all pay $80\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I had a quick text conversation with my girlfriend and we both decided to order expensive deserts raising the price even more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now that you're splitting, you are choosing to raise the bill higher. Since you don't have the numbers, I will assume that this further increased the load of the bill that was due to you. Say 30%. So on the final bill your portion would be $180/person, and everyone else would be $105, but everyone has to pay 120. Again, you don't have numbers, so I am making estimates based on assumptions. So they would pay more than their food, and you would pay way less.\n\nSo to sum up, you ordered more than your \"fair share\" of the bill (splitting bills is dumb in almost every situation but this is true in the vacuum). You then increased that share when you found out the bill was being split. And then you claim people are taking advantage of you by saying you put people out of their price range.\n\nWe could get into the social politics of splitting bills, and how to treat people on their birthday. Honestly, that's the conversation that should have been had (Let's all pay for ourselves ,and then split the birthday person's bill).\n\nYou can't do math, OP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: As I was typing this, you put some changes to the bill.\n\n>INFO: Decided to put the vague prices since I know my friends have Reddit.

Or, in super-busy restaurants on the weekends, they may not ask in the hope that the folks will work it out themselves and save the waiter from having to process separate bills.\n\nI can say, however, (and this is a generational thing) I would consider it presumptuous and rude for a waitperson not to ask at some point.
