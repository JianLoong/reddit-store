Going to try and keep this short. I (35f) and my husband (43m) and our two kids (5f, 2f) love Disney. We are *that* family. We take a Disney vacation every year. We just took one in September and are planning again for January, and next October. \n\nMy stepdaughter (12) has never been interested in going with us. We've always offered, her full expenses paid, and her mom has always said no. That if anyone's taking her to Disney or on a vacation, it's going to be her. Totally understandable, all good. We always come back with souvenirs and snacks for SD and always try to find cool knickknacks for her. Over the summer, before our September trip, something changed. Now SD wants to go with us on these trips, which, to me and my husband, is great! We've always wanted to take her, but didn't want to step on her mom's toes. Well, her mom said \"No\" to the September trip because it was over Labor Day and she'd miss that Tuesday - Friday of school and that was missing too many days. When we talked about the January trip, SD's mom said the same thing (we're leaving on the13th of January, coming back on the 21st. So SD would miss that Tuesday - Friday again) SD was bummed, but ultimately, her mom said no and we didn't want to argue with her.\n\nWell, over the weekend, we're trying to finalize shit. Buy tickets, make reservations, etc. SD is all \"Well now mom says I can go if I'm Ok with missing that many days of school.\" \nI'm like OK. That's great if your mom changed her mind. I didn't buy SD's tickets/make reservations right away because I wanted to talk to her mom about it, just to make 100% sure. I didn't want to buy tickets and then suddenly her mom change her mind again and then we're out of money on wasted tickets, which has happened before with SD and her mom. \n\nDropped SD back off at her mom's this morning and not even 10 minutes later, I'm getting a snarky text from her mom saying \"Stepdaughter's Name can go on the January trip. She is saying you said that I said she can't go. I don't remember us having this conversation and I can't find the texts about now. Now I'm irritated and confused.\" \nTo which, SD texts me \"Mom is mad at me because she doesn't remember talking to you about the Disney trip and she said you're lying about her saying I couldn't go.\"\n\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I *know* we had this conversation because SD's mom picked her up from our house and she was sitting on our porch when we had it. SD's mom has always been \"No, I want to be the one to take her on vacation and I don't want her missing too much school\" - which is totally valid. I don't know if she just doesn't remember but now SD and her mom are making me feel like I fucked up somewhere and got something wrong, whereas my husband is like \"Yeah no, you're right.\" \n\nAITA for being irritated with her mom?", "created_utc": 1668356507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu6aeg/aita_for_not_buying_my_stepdaughter_disney/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is that in their custody paperwork?", "NTA If i was you i would always get prove via text message or record conversation for future proof as she is gaslighting you.", "NTA, now this is a gas light. She's making you question reality, and she is absolutely doing this to fuck with you and destabilize the kid so that she will somehow think you are also at fault for this when her mother is doing it.\n\nI think this is something you guys should get an attorney involved in on if you are going to buy her a ticket to take her on the trip. Like you need to have the mother sign a permission slip saying that she approves of her going on the vacation, or she doesn't. You need to make sure that if she \"changes her mind\" again it is clear not only to you, but to your stepdaughter that it's the mom who is doing this", "Info: you honestly believe a 10-11 year old girl didn't want to go to Disney? Isn't it more likely that she was perfectly well aware of her mother's attitude and was trying to protect her self esteem. It sounds like the ex is super difficult and confrontational. Poor little thing, has to settle for souvenirs. \n\nYou're absolutely NTA for being irritated with the mother. She sounds awful. It's like she's just trying to pick a fight. But please don't take it out on your stepdaughter, she's the one stuck with her.", "NTA. It sounds like the mom is the issue, so just remember when you get texts like that from her, it's probably about her being caught in the middle, not because she's trying to make you feel crazy.", "NTA.

Why have you not gone while SD was a winter or summer break. It seems the main concern was SD missing so much school. Seems kinda like you are deliberately taking these trip during a time of year that SD can\u2019t come.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur husband is an AH for not putting up a harder fight for his daughter.", "This \ud83d\udcaf let your husband deal with his ex.

They are wondering if they are an asshole for being angry and for wanting to pick a fight about this it seems", "This, like I feel like giving out hostile she is, this should be handled through official custody.", "NTA. I have this same issue with my step kids whenever my partner (their dad) and I try to take them on holiday. We always arrange dates based on time off work and public holidays eg Christmas, summer etc and then the night before, the mum will message saying we have to bring them back a day early and leave a day later. The two of us went abroad in the summer and didn\u2019t bring the kids because it\u2019d be too much money and based on the mum\u2019s history, we would\u2019ve bought the 3 passports, booked the plane tickets, hotel and had spending money for them all for the mum to say they\u2019re not coming or say \u201cif you don\u2019t bring them back on this day (day or 2 early) the children will not be going\u201d. Then the kids got upset because we didn\u2019t even ask them. Even trying to go across the country to see my partner\u2019s dad is a problem and we can\u2019t have them more than 5 days, can\u2019t see them on their birthdays or on Christmas Day. 6 more years and all 3 will be 18 (oldest is almost 17 now) so should hopefully be easier! \n\nSometimes the primary carer of the kids are so manipulative, weaponise the kids and emotionally blackmail their ex and new partner. It\u2019s so awful and really hard to keep the kids out of it so they\u2019re not in the middle!", "NTA Whether discussing in person/over the phone, follow up with a text/email so you have a record of anything.

Dad needs to step up and handle the arrangements with the mother of his daughter especially since he knows she's been difficult in the past.", "She's making a big deal out of it because she's playing mind games. She wants ex and SM to look bad to her daughter -- it's a subtle parental alienation tactic disguised as disorganization and confusion.", "This is one of the few examples I\u2019ve seen in this sub where gaslighting was actually present. \n\nI\u2019m going to assume they\u2019ve established a formal custody order. It should have clauses about bringing children out of state, etc. If there aren\u2019t clauses regarding trips, they need to go back and modify the custody order to include stipulations related to traveling. Most of the time it\u2019ll pertain to international travel but maybe they\u2019ll have to include National travel as well.\n\nI do think it would be beneficial for OP to get all further communication in writing, and your idea of a permission slip is definitely solid. Bio mom needs to knock off her shenanigans, because Disney isn\u2019t as simple as just showing up anymore. Adding someone to a reservation can be a hassle. I don\u2019t blame OP one bit for not purchasing these tickets or not including SD in the reservation because the bio mom needs to spite SD\u2019s new family. It\u2019s sad because the only person bio mom is hurting is her own daughter", "Disney tends to be most crowded during school breaks. In addition, if it\u2019s WDW, the weather is disgusting and almost unbearable. Not to mention you run into rainy weather in the summer too. \n\nLook, I have no idea what the excused absence policy is, but I find that elementary and middle schools are willing to work with you when you give them enough notice. I know I went on vacations and i generally had to do assignments to make up my class work, but I never got in trouble for it. SD is 12 years old. If anything, traveling during school now is better than waiting until she gets to high school. Absences doesn\u2019t look as bad in elementary or middle school, especially when they were discussed with the school beforehand. In highschool, excessive unexcused absences might cause issues if the person is applying to college and has poor grades for missing so much work. Missing a week in middle school at the beginning of a marking period won\u2019t tank SD\u2019s GPA to the point where she\u2019ll have to repeat her grade. She\u2019ll have enough time to get back on track if she misses a week.\n\nThe bio mom is just being difficult at this point. Her reasons for not allowing the daughter to go on the trip constantly change. If it\u2019s not her bringing the daughter, step mom can\u2019t. She\u2019ll miss too much school. She\u2019ll probably come up with more reasons too.", "This was my thought exactly.", "Maybe. But considering OP didn't hint at any history of that, I'm leaning towards it being a miscommunication between SD and her mother which led to mother throwing attitude at step mom.\n\nThe best thing that could have happened is stepmom messaging birth mom to verify that SD could go to disneyland at that moment rather than waiting until taking SD home."]}
