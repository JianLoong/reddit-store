I told her absolutely not, that this was something special to me and that I would bring it back with me next time I go see her. She goes on to try to convince me that the dress is just something materialistic, and that I could at least just let her borrow it because they don't have a lot of money for their wedding. At this point I'm getting annoyed and just keep telling her no. She says it would just be for one day and that she will get it tailored for me afterward, and that there's no point in just letting it waste away in my closet.\nNow I'm just annoyed with my mom and I tell her to go find one at the goodwill if she's so desperate and NO her friend cannot have mine.\nMy mom has always tried to convince me to do things I don't want to do and when I was younger she would always get her way, now that im older I've learned to stand up to her and be firm when I say no.
