We've been together for 21 years and married for 16. Long story short: for the last 5 years our relationship has deteriorated significantly. My ex has developed a rather short temper which caused her to react in a physical manner more often than not. \n\nThe first times it happened I chalked it up to her being stressed after giving birth. Even after I realized that wasn't the case it took me a long time to leave because she had convinced me that I would lose my kids if I left her.\n\nIt's been 3 months since I've handed her the papers and for now the kids spend every second week with me.\n\nYesterday before I had to drop them off, my youngest daughter asked me why we're getting divorced. I told her it's because we just didn't love each other anymore.\n\nI thought it was a good diplomatic answer to give to a 5 year old but she asked if it was because \"Mommy kept saying all those mean things to you?\" \n\nThat question caught me a little off guard because I hadn't thought any of the kids had been awake while we fought. That's where I might have messed up because I just said yes and tried to change the subject.\n\nI dropped them off in the late afternoon and 2 hours later my ex called me. She was yelling over the phone how I had lied to our kids so they'd hate her. She kept saying how she would ruin me in court for this and that she'd be suing for parental alienation. I couldn't get a word in so I eventually just hung up.\n\nWas I wrong for telling my child this?

However, if your ex- wife was behaving that bad and the kids have noticed that may be a sign to get them outta there.", "NTA. You just told the truth. And parents should teach their children to tell the truth.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is the AH for exposing your children to her temper.  Even the youngest child recognised her temper was the reason you had to leave.  You didn\u2019t lie to your kids, just confirmed what they already knew.  You responded to a question truthfully and it is important for your children to hear the truth and not be gaslit.\n\nHowever if your wife is so short tempered, who is she going to take her tantrums out on when you are no longer there?  \n\nDefinitely not TA but if you live in a one party state, I\u2019d start recording your interactions with her.", "NTA. The child asked, you didn't dump that information and your answer wasn't also going into details.", "NTA. The first thing you need to do is call your lawyer and document all of this. Next, get custody of your kids. If this is how your ex treats a grown adult, I assure you she is doing it to helpless kids. That\u2019s what abusers do.", "NTA and I would start recording these calls. If that's legal there ...", "You shouldn\u2019t have lied to your child. You shouldn\u2019t have given a straight answer either. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d is a good one.  \n\nBut the truth is that you didn\u2019t lie in some \u201cparental alienation\u201d way. If she brings this up in court, and you say \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell my youngest daughter about the physical abuse, or lie to her, so when she asked if the mean stuff mom said was why we\u2019re getting divorced, I partially agreed\u201d, it\u2019s hard to imagine that\u2019ll be seen as parental alienation. It\u2019s not like you told her about the stuff she didn\u2019t witness herself. You just agreed that that was part of the reason you\u2019re splitting up. That\u2019s not great parenting (worst-case consequences include your kid maybe thinking she has to emotionally handle any partners all the time or they\u2019ll leave her forever), but it\u2019s surely not parental alienation. \n\nNow, why you took that call from your to-be ex, and tried to get a word in edgewise - that was just foolish. Anything you said puts you in a worse legal position than not saying anything at all. She obviously already holds pretty extreme views of you, and you\u2019re getting divorced. Better to say nothing, lest you try to calm her down by inadvertently agreeing to something she can characterize as parental alienation. \n\nIn any case, when it comes to telling your kid, NTA - your kid asked, and you gave an answer rather than lying. It\u2019d be NAH, but your ex\u2019s threats cross squarely into AH territory.", "NTA. I think being honest with your kids was the best route you can go about when it comes to divorce. When my mom left my abusive father, I saw it all and heard it all throughout their marriage. So, when she left she was open and honest with me. I was 5. But, I will say I would recommend you seek professional help and advice moving forward. I say this as my mom had my siblings and I see a therapist and would also get advice on how to handle certain topics with us give them critical nature of divorce and how young we were. Also, make sure you keep evidence and documentation of everything. Technically what she did to you was threatening to take legal action to getting an upper hand in whatever custody/divorce handlings you two having going on. I would say she is trying to instill fear and basically harassing you. From what you have said, it would not be surprising if she does try to sue you or make things worse for you in court. Hope everything work out for you and your kids.", "NTA exactly *but* you probably  could have handled it better.  You should have already had a conversation of some sort about your separation & have been prepared for some of the more common questions.\n\nSaying the two of you no longer loved each other is fine but when she asked about the \u2018mean things\u2019 you should have said something like there\u2019s a lot more involved & if she had more questions you could talk about it (at whatever later time) you had more time available to devote to the conversation.\n\nIf she\u2019s (eta: your ex) threatening parental alienation you may want to consider visiting a family therapist with the kids for advice/direction as a preventative measure if you\u2019re not all seeing someone already.", "The kid is five you should have given a more neutral answer and reinforced that you both still love the kids very much. \n\nAnd yes, kids are generally aware of what goes on, assuming they were asleep is naive.\n\nEdit to say NTA, just you probably could have been more diplomatic about it.", "You\u2019re way too old to ask this kind of question to a bunch of teens on Reddit.", "I don't know, that is a lot to dump on a child.  They can't process things the way adults do.  You could have handled it a different way.  A lot more questions are going to come your way, and you are going to have to figure out how to answer in a way that won't overwhelm them.", "ESH - while you have every right to feel how you feel about your relationship, you are an adult and including your children into this mess is never a good thing to do. They\u2019re 5, they should be protected from this, not let in on why mommy and daddy are fighting. You can always have an open and honest conversation with them as they get older; but as of right now a more generic answer would\u2019ve done you more favors.\n\nAlso, are you concerned that your ex will start to bed talk about you to the children now that you two are no longer together and this event has occurred ? In that case, prep for court so that you can protect them. If she had no issue being abusive to you, it\u2019s not so far fetch that she would do it to the children if things don\u2019t go her way.", "Are you planning to fight for full custody ?\n\nEDIT : ESH.\n\nOne parent is abusive and the other is not going to protect is kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think you should lie but there probably were better ways to handle it.", "NTA", "NTA she is digging her own grave. On top of that she abused you. Kids aren't dumb.", "NTA.  Just be open with  the fact it  is her abuse  and anger that  made you leave, nothing else.  Do you have any witness to how she has treated you?", "NTA if you'd deliberately brought it up then I'd be leaning E S H but honestly you weren't ready to be asked and you didn't dwell on it. Just... be aware of your kids now that your ex lost her punching bag", "NTA\n\nAs a mother and a child of divorce, always be honest with your children when they ask. But, make it a rule to never badmouth the other parent. I'm not saying you did that here, but you could have worded it different. Hindsight is 20-20 and all that... And by honesty I don't mean all details, but at their level of understanding. And it's not all things children need to know. \n\nBut what they do need to know is that you love them, that none of this is their fault. They didn't create this situation. They are loved no matter what. Keep reminding them! \n\nSo going forward, maybe talk a bit with them about this, ask them questions. Have an open dialogue and give them a safe space to ask these questions. Clearly they need it. That way their questions won't come so abruptly and you'll have more time to process your answers. Might want to look into them talking to someone as well.", "NTA. Parental alienation isn't legitimate, there are recent studies you can grab to support that. You could've handled it better, your kid is too young to grasp the situation and you would do well to get some professional advice on how to talk to each one about this because they each need different things from you. \n\nYou've said you're not pursuing full custody at this point. Please see a therapist and work through the way you're still making excuses for her and justifying her behaviour. It's a normal part of an abusive dynamic, but if she's abusive then your kids only have one safe adult to protect them and you've gotta step up. You've been trained to minimise the impact of get behaviour via the standard dynamic of abusive relationships, and that will leave your children exposed to an abusive adult if you don't address it. Who will she take out her feelings on if you're not there? Your kids deserve to be safe, regardless of how it makes you or your ex feel to make that happen. \n\nI'm sorry you're in this situation. Document everything, get professionals involved for yourself and your children, do what's best for them regardless of how it feels for you. It's hard but you've already done the hardest part by leaving, stay on course and do the other hard things your kids need you to do for them so they can be safe", "NTA.  And your child asked a very pointed question - she knew the answer to it before you even had to confirm. And you initially were diplomatic, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to lie to a child when they ask this specific of a question.  Not only is it sort of in the territory of gaslighting, it\u2019s also teaching them that it\u2019s OK to take years of abuse.  There\u2019s an underlying element to that conversation that is about self-respect and protecting and standing up for yourself.  That is an important lesson for any child to know. \n\nI would let your lawyer know what happened so they can get ahead of it.  I don\u2019t think this falls into parental alienation but these things can get tricky in court do anticipating any blows to your case would be good. \n\nSo sorry this has happened to you.
