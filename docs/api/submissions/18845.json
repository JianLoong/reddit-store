It\u2019s not like you told her about the stuff she didn\u2019t witness herself. You just agreed that that was part of the reason you\u2019re splitting up. That\u2019s not great parenting (worst-case consequences include your kid maybe thinking she has to emotionally handle any partners all the time or they\u2019ll leave her forever), but it\u2019s surely not parental alienation. \n\nNow, why you took that call from your to-be ex, and tried to get a word in edgewise - that was just foolish. Anything you said puts you in a worse legal position than not saying anything at all. She obviously already holds pretty extreme views of you, and you\u2019re getting divorced. Better to say nothing, lest you try to calm her down by inadvertently agreeing to something she can characterize as parental alienation. \n\nIn any case, when it comes to telling your kid, NTA - your kid asked, and you gave an answer rather than lying.

I say this as my mom had my siblings and I see a therapist and would also get advice on how to handle certain topics with us give them critical nature of divorce and how young we were. Also, make sure you keep evidence and documentation of everything. Technically what she did to you was threatening to take legal action to getting an upper hand in whatever custody/divorce handlings you two having going on.

But, make it a rule to never badmouth the other parent. I'm not saying you did that here, but you could have worded it different. Hindsight is 20-20 and all that...

They are loved no matter what. Keep reminding them! \n\nSo going forward, maybe talk a bit with them about this, ask them questions. Have an open dialogue and give them a safe space to ask these questions. Clearly they need it. That way their questions won't come so abruptly and you'll have more time to process your answers. Might want to look into them talking to someone as well.", "NTA. Parental alienation isn't legitimate, there are recent studies you can grab to support that. You could've handled it better, your kid is too young to grasp the situation and you would do well to get some professional advice on how to talk to each one about this because they each need different things from you. \n\nYou've said you're not pursuing full custody at this point. Please see a therapist and work through the way you're still making excuses for her and justifying her behaviour. It's a normal part of an abusive dynamic, but if she's abusive then your kids only have one safe adult to protect them and you've gotta step up. You've been trained to minimise the impact of get behaviour via the standard dynamic of abusive relationships, and that will leave your children exposed to an abusive adult if you don't address it. Who will she take out her feelings on if you're not there? Your kids deserve to be safe, regardless of how it makes you or your ex feel to make that happen. \n\nI'm sorry you're in this situation. Document everything, get professionals involved for yourself and your children, do what's best for them regardless of how it feels for you.

And your child asked a very pointed question - she knew the answer to it before you even had to confirm. And you initially were diplomatic, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to lie to a child when they ask this specific of a question.  Not only is it sort of in the territory of gaslighting, it\u2019s also teaching them that it\u2019s OK to take years of abuse.  There\u2019s an underlying element to that conversation that is about self-respect and protecting and standing up for yourself.  That is an important lesson for any child to know. \n\nI would let your lawyer know what happened so they can get ahead of it.

Rather than argue, or say bad things about him, I simply said \"I'm sorry he said that to you.  Do you feel that I treat you that way?\" *Of course* the answer was no.  He was just hateful.\n\nSo they were prolly very confused for a few decades.  As adults now, they realize who he is and who I am.  All the edgy conversations stopped years ago.

The morning of Easter, the kids were searching the house for their baskets.  Ex didn't bother to get up and put the baskets out.  No name calling, just simply relaying a story.", "NTA", "NTA, but for the love of god, don't talk to your ex about this situation at all. Let your lawyer know what happened and what your wife said to you. Do not admit to anything or apologize for anything. Talk about the practical aspects of raising your kids like pickup times etc, and nothing else.  Ask your lawyer what to say if she brings this up again.", "And it\u2019s clear they already were picking up on it which means there\u2019s no hiding it anyways. Help them understand the situation and help them learn to navigate their own relationship with her. Keep honesty open though because if she does anything towards them they need to feel safe enough to tell you", "I dont know brother, I agree you dont lie or teach your kids to lie but maybe a better answer would have been, There are several reasons why we are not staying married but NONE of them involves you (the child).  We both love you without exception.", "The kid *knew*. What OP did wasn\u2019t tell them about it - it was *not lie to them when they asked*. The worst possible thing OP could have done in that situation would be lie to the child about their own memory of what they heard.", "Youngest knew. You think the older two haven\u2019t talked about it around and with her? They\u2019ve discussed it regularly amongst themselves. Even the 5 year old. Kids talk.", ">lil bit early for the youngest children to find out \n\nMaybe the ex should have thought about that before being abusive idk", "this. or get an app like Family Wizard where everything is documented. then the communications can be used in court if need be", "This is the best advice. Get everything in writing.", "Highly recommend. This can be ordered during the divorce and written into custody agreement. I have it since I have a protection order against my ex. An additional benefit is that it is much easier to access these records if needed to prove harassment, etc than it is to access phone records", "Easy way to arrange that is to simply not take the calls and tell her to text you if she has something to say.", "I'm sorry you were put through that. I'm wishing you peace", "Feel like your mom cheated and your dad refused to take her back so he's at fault. That or your dad cheated and your mom feels too embarrassed to tell.", "It shouldn't come up as parental alienation, that unfortunately doesn't mean it won't. The thing about parental alienation is that it's used by abusers to dismis accusations against them. There are whole reunification \"therapies\" that basically try to force a kid to love their estranged parent. Basically gay conversion for liking your parents, including government sanctioned kidnappers for kids who refuse to go. \n\n\nDefinitely something that OP should look into especially since they're going though a tense divorce. Try looking up the article: \"Her Son Said Her Ex Sexually Abused Him. Then She Lost Custody. By Olivia Gentile\" or \"A Court Ordered Siblings to a Reunification Camp With Their Estranged Father. The Children Say It Was Abusive. \"by\u00a0Hannah Dreyfus", "In hindsight she'd always been a bit short tempered but it never turned against another person. I don't what changed and when I brought the topic up she would usually just brush me off. For the last years I mostly stayed because I was scared she'd succeed in taking the kids. It only got really bad last year. I think the moment I decided to leave her was when I ended up needing stitches and I caught myself lying to the nurse about how our cat had scratched me. That was the moment my brain realised how messed up the whole situation was.", "I don't think her mind went that way considering she immediately asked if it's because her mother had been saying mean things which means she's fully aware of the situation", "The children clearly already knew the reality, if a 5 year old picked up on it then the others did as well. He was only confirming their questions rather than leaving them wondering, if he had denied they most likely would have assumed he was covering for his ex anyways. He didn\u2019t put his kids in the middle, they just had their questions answered with a simple one word answer.", "He didn\u2019t dump on the child. He simply answered their questions after his first reply wasn\u2019t completely accepted, and as someone who has been through these things I must say children understand much more in these situations than you think and it is only more painful if they can tell they are being lied to in order for one parent to protect the name of the other.", "100%", "Uh. OP is the man and this is about his wife. His wife is the abusive one.", "OP is showing his children you don't stay in a relationship while being abused. Valuable lesson NTA", "I second this because there\u2019s so many times where parents basically teach their kids that abuse is okay without even noticing.", "1000% this. OP just taught his youngest daughter that if someone is speaking to you in an unkind manner, you don\u2019t have to be around them. My parents taught me that my partner\u2019s anger was always my fault and to keep my mouth shut during conflict. OP might have unintentionally saved his daughter from developing a super toxic mindset or blaming herself for the divorce.", "Also, if the kids were actually asleep when they argued then that mean the mom was saying things around/at the children when Op wasn't around.", "This is the critical fact here. OP didn't bring it up. He was asked a direct question. He answered it honestly and briefly and then redirected the conversation. That is not parental alienation. \n\nMom is alienating them herself. NTA. This is good parenting under difficult circumstances. But keep your attorney in the loop.", "Yeah, kids aren't stupid. They can see things for themselves. Which is why 'staying together for the children' has always been a dumb idea.", "Yeah that wasn\u2019t a \u2018why?\u2019 Sort of question. That was her asking a rhetorical question to confirm her suspicions, she already knew and had probably suspected it for some time.", "100%.  Based on the write up, you answered that you and spouse did not love each other anymore.  When your daughter probe more, you simply gave an honest answer to her question.  NTA", "Children see and understand more than we realise. She asked OP is her mother was abusive and once the mother heard what OP said, the mother promptly got on the phone and ... started abusing OP.\n\nOP needs to tell his lawyer this, ASAP.\n\nHe is NTA", "OP's youngest has a grip of the situation. OP being honest was good. It teaches the kid to leave and not to stick around when your partner abuses you.", "It's hard to say that the mother won't behave badly with her children even though she loves them. It's unpredictable so I agree with other comments that the child needs to know it's bad behavior.", "And if the youngest knows and is willing to ask, the older kids know and were trying to spare their parents' feelings. \n\nIt's an awful feeling that fucked me up in the long term even though my parents went to therapy and stopped arguing loudly in the evenings. I have mild trauma responses to muffled raised voices and there was no abuse involved at all.", "Yeah.  The ages of these kids are the exact same age gaps between myself and my older brother and sister. \n\nThey used to tell me that our parents were getting divorced, my brother would go live with my dad, my sister would live with my mom, and they were gonna drop me at the orphanage.   \n\nThat wasn't even true, but they still told me about it.  Best believe if my parents were actually having issues, we would have discussed it.  \n\nKids aren't stupid and they're actually much more aware than we give them credit for.", "Yep, at 5 I absolutely knew my parents marriage wasn't normal and I internalized a lot. By 10 or 11 I was actively talking about their fights on the playground with my friends. Kids are not dumb", "Yes. This. I\u2019m cases of abuse, this is so important.", "Or often one parent will use a child against the other and this way it is all documented in the app. \n\nFor example: Hey it's my wknd. \"johnny has a sleeover with his friend\" But it's my weekend I have limited time  let him do the sleep over on your weekend\" fight ensues   this way it is all on the app or email", "These apps make it easier/faster for courts to obtain records than phone companies in cases of abuse, harassment, etc.", "text is difficult to subpoena  the apps are already through the court", "You forget it is also used primarily by spiteful parents who weaponize their children against their ex. Happens far too often hence why that is a whole thing. Abusers do use it though to punish their ex and get forced parental time.", "If you can afford it, and can make the time for please go to therapy, it'll help you process and work through what you went through. Even if you can't I know some people find writing it out helpful, so a journal or the internet could help! Wish you and the kids the best moving forward!", "I'm so sorry, that's awful :( I hope you find peace", "I hope so.", "Don\u2019t listen to them - it\u2019s goofy to assume this sub is all teens. Many of us have been here for a long time and this is the exact kind of question we\u2019re used to seeing for years.", "When the focus of the abuse is gone, the abuser looks for a new victim.", "Yes, I noticed that and fixed it. I made stupid assumption, didn't completely comprehend cause I just went through the exact same thing, almost to the T and my tormentor was my husband.", "You'd be banking on a prosecutor cutting an abuse victim a little slack.\n \nWhich is a gamble. A lot of prosecutors only care about numbers.", "I could not agree more. Tell your lawyer op and let them guide you in this but I don\u2019t think that you did anything wrong you just answered your child\u2019s question. If your wife has a problem with the truth about her actions and there consequences then her problem is not with the truth it\u2019s with her own actions. Good luck.", "Also in family court, truth is second to what\u2019s he judge considers \u201cbest interest of the children\u201d. Even if it\u2019s true, telling them something that can colour their view of the other parent is not taken lightly when arguing over custody and visitation.

My parents never got divorced but did separate, and courts were not involved with custody arrangements.  I left with my dad while the younger two stayed with my mom.\n\nMy dad did speak often of my mom's anger issues.

Same case with most CPS in most countries.

Good point.", "The US court system, both civil and criminal, is based on a few assumptions; the primary in this situation being \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d and \u201cburden of proof\u201d. \n\nInnocent until proven guilty means that everyone must be presumed innocent and treated as such until sufficient evidence can be presented where there is no argument or doubt. In the case of a divorce, you aren\u2019t exactly \u201cinnocent\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d but proving grounds for legal separation. Marriage is a legal contract and you\u2019re asking for a court to not only help let you out of it but also act a mediator to settle disputes. So for both fault and no fault divorce states, both former partners are considered to be good people until the opposite can prove otherwise. \n\nBurden of proof is similarly related but is accepted that the requirement to provide evidence supporting claims resides with the party making the claim (basically no outside party can help nor can you incriminate yourself). In this example OP is required to show why they need a divorce and the marriage is unreconcilable. \n\nBut wait, there is more. Part of divorce is a custody hearing. These are treated as a part of the divorce but yet a separate case. It\u2019s also a civil dispute so you aren\u2019t \u201cinnocent\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d but you are fighting parties. You don\u2019t show why the other is guilty or why you are divorcing but show how they harmed the kids. Regardless of the result of the divorce, the judge often (almost always) takes personal liberty to figure out which parent they consider to be the best option. They take the proof provided and decide which parent to go with. So regardless of the divorce proceeding they will make the decision on what is presented in that case. \n\nAll of this sums up to:\n- OP divorces his wife due to physical abuse and substance abuse\n- OP can prove how the marriage was unreconcilable but cannot prove that the kids where substantially harmed \n- OP sues for custody \n- during custody hearing, it comes out that \u201cdaddy told the kids that mom said mean things to him so they are breaking up\u201d, now the official narrative is that OP initiated the divorce and narrative in the children\n- this is enough to tip the scales to give the mother (who already had a significant advantage) to get primary custody (mothers win primary custody in 97% of cases despite abuse, drugs, history of illegal activity, job status or housing)", "No it came into popularity because Woody Allen used it to defend himself from the allegations that he sexually abused his daughter. Which is a whole other can of worms, but I do believe that he abused her. \n\nI'm not saying that parents talking shit about their ex in front of their kids is a thing that doesn't exist. But as it currently stands, the main indicator that parental alienation is going to be diagnosed is the income of the parent claiming to be alienated. Therapist aren't perfect or unbiased,  some of them make a lot of money of this. A lot also claim that they were victims of alienation which makes them biased at best. \n\n\nA lot of the protest against this is also led by the children who were/are in divorce cases like this, so it's not all vengeful parents. \n\n\nLoads of things are bad but not illegal, I think parental alienation should be one of them."]}
