It\u2019s not like you told her about the stuff she didn\u2019t witness herself. You just agreed that that was part of the reason you\u2019re splitting up. That\u2019s not great parenting (worst-case consequences include your kid maybe thinking she has to emotionally handle any partners all the time or they\u2019ll leave her forever), but it\u2019s surely not parental alienation. \n\nNow, why you took that call from your to-be ex, and tried to get a word in edgewise - that was just foolish. Anything you said puts you in a worse legal position than not saying anything at all. She obviously already holds pretty extreme views of you, and you\u2019re getting divorced. Better to say nothing, lest you try to calm her down by inadvertently agreeing to something she can characterize as parental alienation. \n\nIn any case, when it comes to telling your kid, NTA - your kid asked, and you gave an answer rather than lying.

When my mom left my abusive father, I saw it all and heard it all throughout their marriage. So, when she left she was open and honest with me. I was 5.

I say this as my mom had my siblings and I see a therapist and would also get advice on how to handle certain topics with us give them critical nature of divorce and how young we were. Also, make sure you keep evidence and documentation of everything. Technically what she did to you was threatening to take legal action to getting an upper hand in whatever custody/divorce handlings you two having going on.

But, make it a rule to never badmouth the other parent. I'm not saying you did that here, but you could have worded it different. Hindsight is 20-20 and all that... And by honesty I don't mean all details, but at their level of understanding.

They are loved no matter what. Keep reminding them! \n\nSo going forward, maybe talk a bit with them about this, ask them questions. Have an open dialogue and give them a safe space to ask these questions. Clearly they need it. That way their questions won't come so abruptly and you'll have more time to process your answers. Might want to look into them talking to someone as well.", "NTA. Parental alienation isn't legitimate, there are recent studies you can grab to support that. You could've handled it better, your kid is too young to grasp the situation and you would do well to get some professional advice on how to talk to each one about this because they each need different things from you. \n\nYou've said you're not pursuing full custody at this point. Please see a therapist and work through the way you're still making excuses for her and justifying her behaviour. It's a normal part of an abusive dynamic, but if she's abusive then your kids only have one safe adult to protect them and you've gotta step up. You've been trained to minimise the impact of get behaviour via the standard dynamic of abusive relationships, and that will leave your children exposed to an abusive adult if you don't address it. Who will she take out her feelings on if you're not there? Your kids deserve to be safe, regardless of how it makes you or your ex feel to make that happen. \n\nI'm sorry you're in this situation. Document everything, get professionals involved for yourself and your children, do what's best for them regardless of how it feels for you.

And your child asked a very pointed question - she knew the answer to it before you even had to confirm. And you initially were diplomatic, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to lie to a child when they ask this specific of a question.  Not only is it sort of in the territory of gaslighting, it\u2019s also teaching them that it\u2019s OK to take years of abuse.  There\u2019s an underlying element to that conversation that is about self-respect and protecting and standing up for yourself.  That is an important lesson for any child to know. \n\nI would let your lawyer know what happened so they can get ahead of it.  I don\u2019t think this falls into parental alienation but these things can get tricky in court do anticipating any blows to your case would be good. \n\nSo sorry this has happened to you.

Obviously, holds less weight than a recording, but i figure it would still be evidence.", "I will let your lawyer know what happened so they can take it forward. I don't think this falls under parental alienation but these things can get complicated in court so it would be best to hope for no injury in your case.", "Yeah, she already knew. If OP says no to her question, OP will set a bad example for her.", " NTA You've said you're not pursuing full custody at this point. Please see a therapist and work through the way you're still making excuses for her and justifying her behavior. It's a normal part of an abusive dynamic, but if she's abusive then your kids only have one safe \n NTA adult to protect them and you've gotta step up. You've been trained to minimize the impact of getting behavior via the standard dynamic of abusive relationships, and that will leave your children exposed to an abusive adult if you don't address it.

It doesn't matter if it's the \"truth,\" you're not supposed to say it. Also, as a  secondary thing, if they were arguing, and op admits they were, they were saying shit to each other. Arguing is not the mom just talking to herself. It takes 2 to argue. They obviously BOTH said some things the kids shouldn't have heard.

Man geht out of here with that apolegetic bullshit. \nAlso, the kids were obviously already aware of what was happening.
