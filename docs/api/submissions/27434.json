Everyone close to me knows it. Well, last week was my birthday and my friends decided to throw me a surprise party. Super sweet, right?\n\nHere's where it gets sticky. I found out about the surprise a few days in advance (my GF (27F) accidentally let it slip). I snooped for more info and discovered that they decided to make it a fully vegan BBQ to accommodate one new friend (23M) who is vegan. I was a little annoyed because I felt like my birthday was being co-opted for his dietary choices.\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands and told my GF I insist on a meaty BBQ feast for the party. On the day, everyone was surprised (especially me, pretending not to know) but the vegan friend called out the spread and was visibly upset. I told him it was my party and I wanted to eat what I love. A huge argument ensued.\n\nNow, half of my friends think I was an asshole for not respecting the vegan choice for one day and the other half are on my side saying it's my day and I should have what I want.

I found out about the surprise a few days in advance (my GF (27F) accidentally let it slip). I snooped for more info and discovered that they decided to make it a fully vegan BBQ to accommodate one new friend (23M) who is vegan. I was a little annoyed because I felt like my birthday was being co-opted for his dietary choices.\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands and told my GF I insist on a meaty BBQ feast for the party. On the day, everyone was surprised (especially me, pretending not to know) but the vegan friend called out the spread and was visibly upset. I told him it was my party and I wanted to eat what I love. A huge argument ensued.\n\nNow, half of my friends think I was an asshole for not respecting the vegan choice for one day and the other half are on my side saying it's my day and I should have what I want.
