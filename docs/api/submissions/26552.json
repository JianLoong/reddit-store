And I mentioned about celebrating it together but he had work so I said to do it on the weekend and he agreed.\n\nMy best friend was able to purchase two tickets for the ATEEZ concert in Mexico and she invited me (we have been friends for 12 years and our friendship anniversary August 23) and I was so happy I said yes without a second thought. (My anniversary with my BF is in August 22)\nSo, on August 22 I sent a long message with a poem I wrote to my boyfriend, saying happy anniversary and he responded with a heart.\n\n\nI packed and left to Mexico City with my bestie, at mid concert (August 23) my mom calls telling me that my boyfriend is outside waiting for me to go for a romantic dinner and a surprise.\nI was in disbelief since he himself told me that we couldn't spend it together. I sent him a message saying that I was at a concert and that I would be home until Friday evening. And what was happening.\nHe called me \nHe went into a full rant telling me he planned a surprise, and that I shouldn't have gone to a concert even if we hadn't plans cause it was our day and I should respect it\n\n\nI told him that he had to stop yelling and that he needed to calm down so we could talk.\n\n\nHe got angrier so I told him we would talk later or when I got back home and he hang up on me. \nI enjoyed the rest of the concert and when I went home I tried to call him, and was sent directly to voicemail, went to his house and he didn't even open up.\nHe barely had talked to me since then and my bestie and mom say that I don't need to apologize cause I did nothing wrong\n\n\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT:\n\nHe went to his shift at August 21 at night, and my bestie told me about the tickets at 7 pm August 21\n\nI sent him a message at 7:30. The same night I learned about the tickets, and he usually won't turn on his phone until he wakes up.\n\nSo, I thought he would turn on his phone on August 22 or the first hours of August 23 read my message and thats it.\n\nBut he didn't read it the night of the anniversary, he just turn in his phone, popped to his car and went to my house", "created_utc": 1694300339, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ejmfg/aita_for_not_celebrating_my_anniversary_with_my_bf/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even just as an FYI. I don't know why you had to specifically time a message to him. Even if he didn't have access to his phone he could still read it after.", "NTA.\n\nHe told you he had to work. You're not a mind reader, so you couldn't have known he was planning a surprise.\n\nAnd this:\n\n*I shouldn't have gone to a concert even if we hadn't plans cause it was our day and I should respect it*\n\n... is ridiculous. Suppose he really did have to work. He expects you to stay at home and do nothing while he works? Is he **that** possessive of you?\n\n*he hang up on me... He barely had talked to me since then*\n\nSo now he's giving you the silent treatment.\n\nMe, I'd be making sure this first anniversary was our last anniversary.", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fully understanding, but it seems like you agreed to celebrate at the weekend, and August 22 was a Tuesday.  So for that, NTA. \n\nBut you didn\u2019t even tell him you were going to Mexico?   That seems a little odd to me as you\u2019ve been together a year. Not even a \u201chey, X invited me to a concert in Mexico. I\u2019ll be back Friday\u201d?", "NTA, you wanted to do something, he said he wasn\u2019t free so you made other plans. If you\u2019re planning a surprise you can simply say keep that day free and just not disclose info about it", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him an apology. If he was planning a surprise for you then he could have said something like \u201cas of right now I\u2019m busy that day but please keep your day open in case something changes and im able to do something with you\u201d. It\u2019s done & pretty much over now, so all y\u2019all can do is learn & grow from the situation.", "Your BF should have learned a valuable lesson about surprises, but it appears that he has chosen to remain ignorant.  A much more mature response would be to let you know what he had planned and to reschedule.  Instead he went into pout mode.  He decided to surprise you, but then got upset because you in turn surprised him (by not being home).  There is a reason adults make plans.  \n\nYour post does not give ages, but I am hoping that your BF is 20 or younger, because then there is hope for him.  Your relationship with him is probably over, but that may be for the best.  Your BF still has a lot of growing up to do.\n\nNTA", "See this is the problem with surprises. You get in trouble for making other plans because you didn't know what your significant other planned.", "I HATE surprises.  Just tell me, generally, what you have planned and I will set aside time for you, and for us.  But do NOT try to surprise me.  Just don't.  (NTA)", "NTA. He was the one who was supposedly too busy to celebrate on the day of your anniversary, pretty unfair of him to expect you to mind read that he actually does care about celebrating on the exact date.\n\nIf he wanted you to stay free at that date and time, he needed a decoy plan to keep you available. Pretty standard when planning a surprise event - you need a way to make sure the person will be there for the surprise.\n\nMy partner and I don't put that much stock into celebrating things on the exact date - I don't think it's unreasonable that you made other plans when he was the one who told you he wasn't available.", "NTA. It's a nice attempt on his part to try to surprise you, but you did nothing wrong by making plans when he said he had to work. I'd be far more concerned with his subsequent reason. \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. You went on an international trip and he was unaware and got mad at you? I would have said NAH except his reaction sounds like a total asshole.", "NAH. He had prepared a surprise but you're not a mind-reader, you had the right to accept your friend's invitation if you were free that day.\n\nOn the other hand, I wonder why you don't communicate about such things ? Don't you tell your boyfriend when you're going on a trip? I'm a bit surprised because these are often information that people share naturally as a couple but IDK.", "NTA. You can't be blamed for not knowing about a surprise he had planned. You had a conversation about what the plans were and agreed to do something on the weekend. Although I usually tell my partner when I have things planned, so I'm wondering why he didn't know you were going to a concert?", "NAH. I think this was more a miscommunication.\nHe wanted to surprise you so he did the whole we ain't going to do anything. I do think personally I wouldn't do something else on my anniversary because of this reason, you never know when u decide last minute you want to be romantic. Also I personally would apologize to him, not because I went to the concert, but because I didn't let him know. If he knew, maybe he could have told you he was planning a surprise. So yea. Miscommunication NAH.", "You're in your 30s and you track a \"friendship anniversary\"? I assumed you were 20. Anyway ESH bc of ridiculous communication all the way around.", "I\u2019m going ESG cause I really don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, seems like both of you don\u2019t really like eachother", "YTA you still coulda done something nice for him.", "YTA.. but only if you didn't tell him you were going to the concert..  if he didnt know, which it looks like he didnt then you are a major AH..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
