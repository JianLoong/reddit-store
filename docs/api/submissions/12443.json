Lexi has a daughter, Bella (5). I have a daughter who is 3yo.\n\nWe all live in the same city, but Matt and Lexi live in suburbs, and I live in the city centre, so about 45 minutes away. While I see Matt on average every 3 weeks, I only see Lexi and Bella every 2/3 months at my parents' house or for occasions/gatherings.\n\n2 days ago I got a text from Lexi asking me to babysit Bella on Wednesday because she would not be at school due to teachers being on strike. She said she forgot about the strike and had not taken the day off work, and had also made social plans for after her shift ended. I said no to babysitting and thought that was that.\n\nYesterday, around lunchtime, I was having a skin treatment when one of my cleaners came to tell me that Lexi had dropped off Bella. The cleaner had answered the door and Lexi had said she had arranged to leave Bella with us, and the cleaner was unaware this wasn't the plan and let her in, Lexi then left. I was livid. I immediately called Lexi, and after 4 declined calls and voicemails I sent her a text saying if she didn't return for her daughter within 15 minutes I was going to call the police to say she had abandoned her child. I find my husband to tell him what is going on, and he calls Matt, and tells him to sort this out. A few minutes after speaking to Matt, Lexi reappears. She marched straight into the den where Bella is watching TV, saying how evil we were for telling Matt and threatening to call the police. I tried to get her to come and speak in the study so Bella couldn't hear but she just kept going on. I reminded her that she intentionally abandoned her child, but she kept going on about how she was desperate and needed to go to this social arrangement and how she never has time to do anything. I reiterated that be that as it may, she can't just leave Bella with us when we didn't agree to it. Lexi kept bring up excuses until my husband lost it and told her in no uncertain terms to leave. By this point Bella was in hysterics and Lexi seemed totally frazzled.\n\nThis has since turned into a big thing. Lexi has been posting cryptic things on social media about how hard it is to be a mother when 'people you expect to be there for you' won't help you. I've received texts from her saying Bella is devastated to find out that we don't like her (I've now blocked Lexi). My parents have heard about it and while my mother is firmly on my side, my dad said was it really worth upsetting Bella when she was already there. Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later. Matt also thinks my husband owes Lexi an apology for intimidating her, which I don't think he does.", "created_utc": 1678978313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11swbmr/aita_for_how_i_handled_my_brothers_girlfriend/", "score": 712, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you/your husband wanted to apologize to someone, you could apologize to Bella just to try to make her understand that she did nothing wrong - but it was 100 percent Lexis fault that all this happened in front of Bella, not yours. I just doubt Lexi will ever see she\u2019s in the wrong and I don\u2019t want Bella to think she did anything wrong or that you don\u2019t like her or something.

You have the right to so no to babysitting. You had the right to demand Lexi pick up her child after dropping her off without approval. She didn't have the right to lie to your cleaner. She definitely did not have the right to not take your calls after she dropped her off. She could have been endangering Bella if Bella got sick or injured. You were well within your right to threaten to call the cops about an abandoned child, because that is exactly what she was by that point. Lexi did not have the right to get mad that you said no and then refused to keep the child she dropped off without permission. Her social life is not your concern. That concern is for her and her husband to deal with. Lexi was the one that would not step away from Bella during the confrontation causing Bella to be very upset. Your dad felt you should have just taken care of Bella once she was there but she was dropped at your house, not his, so he really had no say in the matter.  Regardless of what Matt said about keeping Bella there once Lexi dropped her off, you should not have kept her as that would have been the same as accepting that Lexi can do whatever she wants with no consequences. And no one owes Lexi an apology since she could have stayed home with Bella in the first place and not a) not dumped Bella on you or b) just picked Bella up and taken her home, rather than choose to fight with you and your husband when she was wrong for trying to force you into caring for her. The only one that owes anyone an apology is Lexi and she needs to apologize to several people:\n\n1) **you** for many reasons, among them not accepting your refusal to babysit Bella, dropping her off anyway after being told no, and for arguing about it when she came to pick her up, demanding that her social needs are more important than your right to refuse her\n\n2) **your husband** for choosing to argue with him, and \n\n3) **Bella** for dropping her off where she wasn't supposed to be and scaring her by throwing her temper tantrum about not getting her way and \n\n4) **your parents** for involving them", "NTA.", "NTA If you had done as your father suggested and kept Bella just argue with Lexi about it later, Lexi would have interpreted it as she could continue to drop off Bella without pre-arranging her stay.

And you can tell her from me that no one put a gun to her head to have a baby.  There are no breaks in being a mother.   I had to remind my sister of this.

This is unacceptable behavior from Lexi.", "NTA, that is literally the definition of abandonment.", "I think the most important piece here\u2019s is that your SIL didn\u2019t even drop her daughter off with you. She dropped her off with your CLEANERS! Literal strangers! Who does that??\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to just decide you\u2019re babysitting after you said no.
