Lexi has a daughter, Bella (5). I have a daughter who is 3yo.\n\nWe all live in the same city, but Matt and Lexi live in suburbs, and I live in the city centre, so about 45 minutes away. While I see Matt on average every 3 weeks, I only see Lexi and Bella every 2/3 months at my parents' house or for occasions/gatherings.\n\n2 days ago I got a text from Lexi asking me to babysit Bella on Wednesday because she would not be at school due to teachers being on strike. She said she forgot about the strike and had not taken the day off work, and had also made social plans for after her shift ended. I said no to babysitting and thought that was that.\n\nYesterday, around lunchtime, I was having a skin treatment when one of my cleaners came to tell me that Lexi had dropped off Bella. The cleaner had answered the door and Lexi had said she had arranged to leave Bella with us, and the cleaner was unaware this wasn't the plan and let her in, Lexi then left. I was livid. I immediately called Lexi, and after 4 declined calls and voicemails I sent her a text saying if she didn't return for her daughter within 15 minutes I was going to call the police to say she had abandoned her child. I find my husband to tell him what is going on, and he calls Matt, and tells him to sort this out. A few minutes after speaking to Matt, Lexi reappears. She marched straight into the den where Bella is watching TV, saying how evil we were for telling Matt and threatening to call the police. I tried to get her to come and speak in the study so Bella couldn't hear but she just kept going on. I reminded her that she intentionally abandoned her child, but she kept going on about how she was desperate and needed to go to this social arrangement and how she never has time to do anything. I reiterated that be that as it may, she can't just leave Bella with us when we didn't agree to it. Lexi kept bring up excuses until my husband lost it and told her in no uncertain terms to leave. By this point Bella was in hysterics and Lexi seemed totally frazzled.\n\nThis has since turned into a big thing. Lexi has been posting cryptic things on social media about how hard it is to be a mother when 'people you expect to be there for you' won't help you. I've received texts from her saying Bella is devastated to find out that we don't like her (I've now blocked Lexi). My parents have heard about it and while my mother is firmly on my side, my dad said was it really worth upsetting Bella when she was already there. Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later. Matt also thinks my husband owes Lexi an apology for intimidating her, which I don't think he does.", "created_utc": 1678978313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11swbmr/aita_for_how_i_handled_my_brothers_girlfriend/", "score": 2007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your brother that and Lexi should be groveling she doesn't have a record with CPS now.", "NTA\n\nif she continues to post snarky remarks - I would post the story.  \n\nunfortunately this lady is manipulating the situation to make Bella feel bad.  ugh.  just try to remember - if it wasn't THIS event, she would use something else.\n\ndon't try to justify or explain ANYTHING about this anymore - just rinse and repeat \"I said NO\"", "Plus, she left her with THE CLEANERS, not OP. How would she even know when OP might return, given that she had been TOLD they could/not watch Bella? Unbelievable. And poor little Bella is caught right in the middle of the mom-engineered drama, feeling like nobody wants her, including her mom.\n\n NTA.", "My ex and I had no help raising our 2 kids.  Our parents were not interested in having a relationship with their grandchildren (we both had abusive parents).  Siblings didn't help either.  We did what we had to do.  My ex was getting her PH.D. at the time so I did double duty.  We never even considered dropping our kids on someone else.  OP is absolutely NTA but brother's GF is big time.", "Oh, he probably does, but the reoccurring theme of this sub is the bs that people are subjected to in the name of \"family.\" \n\nStill, I like the idea of Dad babysitting his granddaughter at the drop of a hat, no matter what he has going on, cause no apparently means \"Yes, if Lexi wants it.\"", "Busy? How was she busy? She was getting pampered while her multiple servants cleaned the house and looked after her kid, LOL.", "I feel like people only cryptic post because they know that they\u2019re in the wrong.\n\nLike if someone I trusted actually was \u201cevil\u201d, I\u2019d call them out with names and receipts. But we all know op isn\u2019t evil and there are no receipts.", "While \"one of\" her cleaners. She literally has multiple servants. I doubt if she's even watching her own kid. Everyone's downvoting this but this woman has a household full of help and couldn't even do a favour for her brother's girlfriend who actually had a job she had to go to, while OP was gadding about at home getting \"skin treatments\". This isn't even just about privilege, it's about being a truly self-absorbed human being completely lacking in empathy. Lexi may have overstepped, but she was desperate. OP is just horrifying.", "Bella is 5, highly doubt she has a phone.", "The cleaners are not \"servants\". They work for an agency that I use to have my house cleaned weekly. And btw, my husband was with our daughter, not sure if you were insinuating that I need to be with my child 24/7 to be considered a good mother, or that I have a nanny, but neither is true.\n\nSecond, \"no\" is a complete sentence. I'm not obliged to look after any child except my own. And Lexi was not desperate, she was not at work, she wanted to go to a social engagement.", "Oh totally misread that. Thought Bella was Matt\u2019s daughter. My bad", "Wow then this situation is even more wild. \n\nHer first stop should've still been to ask your brother, the man she lives with and shares a household with, to step in to provide the child care. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact she foisted her child on you when its not even your biological niece is truly beyond entitled.", "Childless by choice \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. People know better than to leave their child with me.", "There's a decent chance the police would remain with the child at the residence until shown proof the residents said no, as well as reached out to the parents to say \"get your kid\". However, it's likely after they know you've done your due diligence, they would take the kid and bring them to the station.\n\nJust sayin', the cops aren't huge fans of being intermediaries. They'd make sure at least some communication had occurred first", "Saying you're gonna call the police...thats overreacting. You don't want to keep her then call your brother first...then your parents at least. Calling cops so cps could get come get her is extreme.  THAT, would be more emotionally damaging to the little girl. The punishment would not fit the crime. She shouldn't have dropped her off but don't go overboard.", "NTA you should've just called the police", "If anyone is the * then it must be me for reading this post and thinking that it sounded like a script for one of those \"  The Real Bored Entitled Housewives of First World Problems \" tv shows.", "OP and her husband are NTA!

Neither is your husband. And it's not your job to babysit. Let needs to know the world does not revolve around her. Sorry Bella was hurt over this.", "NTA. If someone is willing to abandon her child at your place to force you to take care of her, you have to set boundaries forcefully or else she'll keep trying to pull this type of thing. It's a big red flag that she didn't cancel her social plans when she needed emergency childcare. It indicates that she isn't just going to expect child care when she's desperate but whenever she doesn't feel like being a parent.", "NTA. Tell your dad you now know he's available to babysit Bella at all hours with zero notice and you'll let your brother know that.\n\nGood for you for standing your ground.", "NTA. ask your bro to babysit bella then and probably he should start babysitting lexi also cuz she is throwing way more tantrums than bella. show this thread to your bro and dad and cut connection with lexi till she starts behaving like an adult", "NTA\n\nOnce you let it happen, she will think it's ok to just dump her child on you. You and your husband did the right thing.", "NTA\n\n>Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later.\n\nAll this would do is teach Lexi that her drop and run trick worked. Even if you argued about it later, she still would have gotten what she wanted.", "If you had done as your father suggested... just allowed Bella to stay after she'd been dropped off anyway... Lexi would have taken this to mean that she doesn't have to respect \"no\" for an answer. She can just drop off her kid and take off and you'll take care of her kid anyway. She needs to understand that no means no. NTA", "NTA. You said no to babysitting and Lexi dropped Bella off anyway. If Lexi can\u2019t handle a child she should have never gotten pregnant. Lexi definitely the AH.", "I\u2019m having trouble with my memory lately due to a medical issue and I\u2019m having trouble remembering the relationships. So Lexi is OP\u2019s brother\u2019s gf and Bella is Lexi\u2019s child but not the brother\u2019s (Matt?). Thanks in advance.", "NTA. She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the police first.", "This. OP, you were right. This woman behaved in a crazy way. Your brother should be reconsidering his relationship.", "Yeah for some reason the dad pisses me off more than anything. WTF kind of parent are you that you just expect your daughter to be treated with zero respect, and be okay with it to make it easy for everyone? What a loser.", "Yes, on this!", "My parents live 3 hours away, they weren\u2019t going to be able to help. And I never actually called the police, I just needed Lexi to take the situation seriously. I wouldn\u2019t have called them without speaking to Matt.", "They (Matt & Lexi) are not married. Furthermore, Bella is not Matt\u2019s child.", "Probably a dad that didn't do much of the parenting, tbh", "Not even Step-granddaughter since Matt and Lexi aren't married.\n\nAnd unless there is something in comments, no reason to believe that OP's parents are nearby.", "My husband was actually with our daughter, but even if I did leave her with someone for an hour to do something, what is the problem with that? She goes to nursery school for half days, is that not allowed either?", "She could be lying in bed sipping champagne and eating strawberries for all I care.  She said no.  That is a complete sentence.  Lexi is not entitled to anything from OP.", "You did the exact right thing. She declined your call 4 times because she knew she was in the wrong. I think if you would have told her \u201ccome get your kid or I\u2019m calling my brother\u201d she would have just left it for him to deal with, played the victim and the manipulative triangulation game, and not had to take any accountability to you and your husband- the two people she directly put in this situation. Whether you actually would have called the police or your brother is beside the point.", "That's good. Just use logic. You already knew you weren't the a**hole. You never had to ask.", "Hello to brother's girlfriend! You are way too invested in this.", "Even if she had a multitude of servants and her own Nanny, OP has no obligation to watch her brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s kid. No means no. Seems like you are misdirecting your anger at OP because she is financially well off. That makes you TA. OP, NTA.", "Like the OP, I'd give the parents a chance to rectify the situation first because I wouldn't want to expose a child to child protection unless they were in danger, but the threat would definitely be there because the mom needs to know in no uncertain terms that you aren't going to let her get away with stunts like this.", "It may be state specific, but I\u2019m almost positive that in my state, if you were to call the cops for something like this, they\u2019ll probably show up but the child would only be released into the custody of a social worker. Which, honestly, GOOD LUCK getting your kid back from CPS at that point, the cops would probably be easier.", "NTA Tell Lexi , next time you say \"no\" and she tries to drop off Bella, you will not argue. You will go straight to the police station and make an abandonment claim.\n\nActions have consequences.", "NTA!  No one has a right to EXPECT others to be there for them.  No one has the right to not accept NO as an answer and do what they want to do anyway.  You owe no one an apology.  Mom and dad need to stay out if it and your brother might want to talk to his wife about dropping off their child with a house cleaner.", "NTA", "NTA. You tried to keep the unpleasant discussion from being in front of the child. That is on the mom. Plus, I am sure she has said nasty things since. You could tell your dad that next time she leaves the child with you without your permission,  you will put the child in your car and drive her to him to watch, whether it is ok with him or not.\n\nLexi needs to apologize to you, your husband and her child.", "WOW another candidate for mother of the year just leave your child where ever and expect someone to take care of her", "*\"Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later.\"*\n\nNo, just no.  She asked in advance, you said no.  She took advantage of the cleaner answering the door to dump and run.  Allow her to get away with this once without immediate consequences and she will do it again.  And again.  And again until it becomes acceptable and you cannot figure out why you are watching Bella every single Wednesday!  NTA", "Your brother is such a comical hypocrite.  How come he didn't step up to take care Bella?? After all he is the one dating Lexi and he can't look after Bella for few hours so Lexi can go to her \"social engagement\"?? Why you had to be the one getting dumped with a kid.\nNTA.", "NTA. Matt should be furious that Lexi abandoned Bella. Lexi left her child with a complete stranger.  She didn\u2019t even check if you were home.  Lexi is lucky you didn\u2019t call the cops.", "lol I think this is a work of fiction and you didn\u2019t realize that the LA teachers\u2019 strike isn\u2019t until NEXT week", "I got 20 bucks that says she is cheating in OP's brother", "Also, she obviously wasn't in desperate streets if she was able to come back and pick Bella up after all \n\nNTA for sure and Lexi is really a piece of work.", "Her mom left her with a cleaner who is almost for certain a complete stranger", "The brother isn't married to Lexie, he is her boyfriend,  he was probably working, I would guess. Plus, for some reason, Lexie didn't want him to know about the social event. At least, that's what has been said in the comments.", "I completely agree.  I would say that she also needs to apologize to the cleaner for lying to them and possibly jeopardizing their job", "I agree, it was completely selfish.  What if OP was completely unreasonable and fired the cleaner for this? Lexie jeopardized a strangers employment as well", "It was her brother who said that not her husband", "Yes, that is correct. \n\nAlso, I am sorry that you are having medical issues and hope that you feel better soon", "I had 4 kids to take care of after my divorce. Their dad was depressed and I had to keep them for several months by myself while he pulled himself out. No help from his family, no help from him, no breaks. I pretty much had no social arrangements for 8 years. Even on the weekends I didn't have the kids. NTA", "IMO, Matt is also an A H.\n\nDid you notice how he says \n\n>*while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later.* \n\nmeaning: \"Yeah, well, she shouldn't have done that, but she was already gone, so you should have given her a pass and just babysat until Lexi decided it was time to come get the kid\".\n\nAnd then:\n\n>*Matt also thinks my husband owes Lexi an apology for intimidating her, which I don't think he does.*\n\nSo he doesn't really think what Lexi did was wrong, does he? Maybe OP should put a nice, LC, cooling period in place, because he will keep trying to paint Lexi as the victim and get OP to forgive her - which will probably lead to another attempt of forced babysitting.\n\nOP is NTA, no question. Neither is her husband. Or poor little Bella.  \n\nBut OP's dad gets the A H stamp too, since he is trying to guilt OP using the same words Matt did. So, since grandpa made it so clear whose side he's on, maybe Lexi should leave Bella with him next time she feels the need to socialize without her daughter.", "One that doesn't think that caring for a 5 year old is a big deal because they never really did it.", "It's probably more like just give in, and she'll shut up and stay", "No matter who said it, the fact remains the same. The more you allow someone to get away with this kind of crap, the more they\u2019ll do it.", "I completely agree,  I was just letting you know that her husband had her back :)", "NTA. What would have happened if your cleaner hadn't been there? Would she leave Bella on the doorstep with a note? \n\nOP, you handled this properly and Lexi needs to learn that no means no and she has to handle her life since she has a child and the child takes precedence over her social events.", "Why would she wanna leave her kid with someone who doesn\u2019t want them there? That\u2019s weird asl", "You're both AH but no worries because you totally won the AH contest that day with special points for making the little girl cry. I feel sorry for your kid.", "NTA what a psycho. Bet she walks all over your brother if she expects to be able to pull that shit.", "What you allow you teach! Allowing your SIL to stomp your boundaries will make sure she will continue to do the same thing again and again!", "INFO why couldn't Matt watch his own kid?", "Actually, I think OP should let Lexi know what your dad said because it is clear he is offering to babysit if Lexi were to just drop off Bella with no warning.  Make sure you are telling dad that you will offer him up too so he knows why it is happening.", "Never know these days. It's common to see kids that young with a tablet."]}
