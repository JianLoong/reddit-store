Lexi has a daughter, Bella (5). I have a daughter who is 3yo.\n\nWe all live in the same city, but Matt and Lexi live in suburbs, and I live in the city centre, so about 45 minutes away. While I see Matt on average every 3 weeks, I only see Lexi and Bella every 2/3 months at my parents' house or for occasions/gatherings.\n\n2 days ago I got a text from Lexi asking me to babysit Bella on Wednesday because she would not be at school due to teachers being on strike. She said she forgot about the strike and had not taken the day off work, and had also made social plans for after her shift ended. I said no to babysitting and thought that was that.\n\nYesterday, around lunchtime, I was having a skin treatment when one of my cleaners came to tell me that Lexi had dropped off Bella. The cleaner had answered the door and Lexi had said she had arranged to leave Bella with us, and the cleaner was unaware this wasn't the plan and let her in, Lexi then left. I was livid. I immediately called Lexi, and after 4 declined calls and voicemails I sent her a text saying if she didn't return for her daughter within 15 minutes I was going to call the police to say she had abandoned her child. I find my husband to tell him what is going on, and he calls Matt, and tells him to sort this out. A few minutes after speaking to Matt, Lexi reappears. She marched straight into the den where Bella is watching TV, saying how evil we were for telling Matt and threatening to call the police. I tried to get her to come and speak in the study so Bella couldn't hear but she just kept going on. I reminded her that she intentionally abandoned her child, but she kept going on about how she was desperate and needed to go to this social arrangement and how she never has time to do anything. I reiterated that be that as it may, she can't just leave Bella with us when we didn't agree to it. Lexi kept bring up excuses until my husband lost it and told her in no uncertain terms to leave. By this point Bella was in hysterics and Lexi seemed totally frazzled.\n\nThis has since turned into a big thing. Lexi has been posting cryptic things on social media about how hard it is to be a mother when 'people you expect to be there for you' won't help you. I've received texts from her saying Bella is devastated to find out that we don't like her (I've now blocked Lexi). My parents have heard about it and while my mother is firmly on my side, my dad said was it really worth upsetting Bella when she was already there. Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later. Matt also thinks my husband owes Lexi an apology for intimidating her, which I don't think he does.", "created_utc": 1678978313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11swbmr/aita_for_how_i_handled_my_brothers_girlfriend/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wasn't an emergency, she just didn't want to cancel her plans.", "NTA You did the right thing calling Lexi to come get her kid. If you had let Bella stay, Lexi would think she could drop off her kid anytime, knowing that you would end up keeping her. No one owes Lexi an apology. It is her fault her Bella got so upset.", "NTA. You refused already and if this social arrangement was so important then she should have hired a babysitter earlier rather than leaving her child at someone's place who clearly stated they aren't okay with babysitting. She had two days to find someone yet she chose not to so it is a deliberate choice. \nMoreover you did ask her to talk in private so that the kid won't hear the argument but since she is the one who didn't listen, I don't see how it is your fault at all.", "NTA. \n\nThat's the whole trick of dropping off kids and leaving.\n\nYour dad needs to wise up and shut up.\n\nLet Lexi know ypur dad has volunteered to have Bella illegally abandoned with him.", "NTA - You needed to draw a hard line defining your boundaries because SIL didn't get it.", "Does your dad realize Lexis behavior was childish and she threw a tantrum in front of her own daughter? That was not okay of her to drop her daughter off. You did the right thing. NTA", "NTA. All of this is 100% on Lexi.\n\nYou are allowed to say no, and blocking Lexi entirely is the only way forward. I hope your brother sees her for who she is, and recognizes that what she did was completely inappropriate.", "NTA,\nYou set it clear from the start you didn\u2019t want to babysit that day and Lexi knew what she was doing by leaving Bella with the cleaner and then avoiding your calls.\nFurthermore Bella getting upset isn\u2019t really on you it\u2019s on Lexi for choosing to argue in front of her own daughter. \nEven if Lexi is having a bad time of it, that doesn\u2019t make it your responsibility to fix that.", "NTA\n\nIf you just watched Bella and argued about it later Lexi would have gotten what she wanted and learned nothing from it.\n\nAt least now she knows when you say no, that is what it means and you won't roll over and just accept it.", "NTA\n\nYou don't just dump children on other people to force them to babysit when they already said no.

You said no and she still seen it fit to just ditch her kid there? What if you weren't home? She clearly didn't bother to check.\n\nLexi took the most immature route in this whole piece. I feel bad for the kid to witness all of it but from what I can see you weren't left with much choice.", "Man screw that lady, this was definitely appropriate, i hate when people just force there kids on you like that", "NTA. The only AH here is Lexi for not making other arrangements and just leaving her daughter with the cleaner...I mean who does that? As for traumatizing Bella, that's all on her mom for not being rational in the first place.", "NTA. \n\n>Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later.\n\nThis is one option but as entitled as Lexi seems, she would have twisted the scenario into, \"it's okay to drop her off whenever I want\"", "Matt\u2019s wrong, your husband does not owe Lexi an apology. Lexi owes pretty much everyone an apology - you, your husband, and one to her daughter! If you/your husband wanted to apologize to someone, you could apologize to Bella just to try to make her understand that she did nothing wrong - but it was 100 percent Lexis fault that all this happened in front of Bella, not yours. I just doubt Lexi will ever see she\u2019s in the wrong and I don\u2019t want Bella to think she did anything wrong or that you don\u2019t like her or something. With a mother like that, Bella is going to need all the support that she can get from other people in her life.", "NTA. Lexi is responsible for Bella being upset. You did nothing wrong. Don't get people with kids that think family owes then on demand babysitting. Sorry but drop and run police should have been called. No means no.", "NTA Lexi is. My heart goes out to Bella who's caught in the middle of this. Lexi's the one who owes you and your husband an apology.", "Nta. You can't dump kids on people unexpectedly, period.\n\nIf you do want to be the asshole, and start more drama, comment on her next secretive post about how dropping your kid off unannounced and without talking to you is child abandonment. \n\nThen do a post about \"zero days since X aplogized for abandoning her child, and blaming us for her poor parenting\"", "Why wasn\u2019t Bella left with Bella\u2019s dad instead of you?  Had you just rolled with it, it would begin to happen often.  Also, why was a social engagement so critically important and last minute?  Why was Lexi upset that you let your brother know?", "NTA AT ALL. And I highly doubt SIL is that intimidated by your husband if she leaves her kid there and starts shouting about it in your home...", "ESH, but Lexi way more than you.\n\nOn your end, threatening to call the police and making a fuss about it in front of the kid was probably not the best course of action. However, getting in touch with Matt was absolutely the right move, and Lexi has no right to be upset about that when she ignored you attempts of communication. If you owe anyone an apology, it\u2019s the daughter and absolutely not Lexi.\n\nOn her end, the obvious - she crossed a boundary you clearly set. Furthermore, you could\u2019ve easily not been home, had guests over, or have been in another situation that wouldn\u2019t have made you available to adequately watch her daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
