I have been wanting to go to this race since F1 first announced it and started saving up money for it. Well now that I have the tickets and hotel room my parents want me to take my little brother(13). I tried explaining to them that I want to go with either my one of my cousins or one of my close friends that are closer to my age. I\u2019m leaving up to a raffle to decide who goes to make it as fair as possible. Well now my parents(especially my mom) is demanding that i add my brother to the raffle so he too has a chance of going to the Race. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love spending time with my brother, i love him to death but I don\u2019t want to be responsible for him at all times and i also don\u2019t want to have to pay for his food and expenses while over there and tbh he\u2019s not a big fan of F1.

You aren't a terrible brother, you're just a dude looking to have a good weekend without babysitting duties.", "NTA you saved up and you get to choose who goes. I would\u2019ve just told them my friend paid for the ticket or is going to pay you back even if it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s just not the same going with a 13 yr old. Not even safe if you think about it Vegas is too much for 13 yr olds.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are being unreasonable and unfair. You are *not* a terrible brother. It's incredibly unfair of them to turn a trip that you saved up for to see an event that really means something to you into babysitting your little brother who doesn't *really* give a shit about F1 and will be bored by the end of FP1 with two more days of race weekend to go. \n\nHold the line with a firm no. You earned the trip you imagined. Take that trip. \n\nIf you really feel like you have to give them some kind of concession, suggest an alternative with the little brother on another weekend, like a camping trip.", "Vegas with a 13-yo? No thanks.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It might help for your little brother to tell your mom that he doesn\u2019t want to go, if he\u2019s willing to help you out.  If he doesn\u2019t like F1 and doesn\u2019t want to go, she has no good reason to shoehorn him into the trip.  Better that you plan something you\u2019ll both enjoy for another day.", "NTA, honestly you should only do the raffle if thats truly what you want to do. I suggest just picking the person that youll have the most fun with or that can appreciate it the most. Doesnt hurt if the person you pick can take care of their own financial expenses in the trip as well if applicable", "NTA. As much as I enjoy F1, is someone who isnt a fan going to enjoy watching practice, qualifying, support races etc, or will they be complaining its hot, one car at a time is boring. Not to mention having to be responsible for a minor on what should be a special and very expensive opportunity for you. take someone who's on your level about the experience", "Your mother is welcome to pay your brother's way.", "Your parents are assholes.  They can get tickets and take your brother.", "Just rig the raffle.", "NTA, your brother would probably better enjoy spending time with his own friends, and you\u2019re grown and paid for everything yourself. obviously you\u2019d prefer enjoying that experience with a friend", "NTA", "NTA, your parents just want a child free house, so they can have time to themselves.", "NTA\n\nWhat if you take him? Would it make your parents feel better? No, they won't because they'll still shit on you for being a terrible brother. Your brother doesn't like F1. He's gonna be in Las Vegas and is gonna make you go and buy whatever he wants, which you can't accommodate. Even if he doesn't ask, he'll eventually get bored over watching the race and will also be uncomfortable (assuming you'll be watching in the open) and will complain the entire way, and when he goes home, which would mean your mother will call you out anyway for being a terrible brother who couldn't take care of his younger brother instead of watching some stupid race. And your cousins or friends would also be mad at you for not taking them. So all round shit for you anyway. So might as well refuse and go with your cousins/friends and have a blast.", "NTA,\n\nThey probably want something special for their other son too. Or maybe this makes your parents kid-free for the weekend?\n\nIt's just not going to be the same with your brother than with a friend. You'll have less freedom, you'll need to watch your brother.\n\nMaybe you can talk to your brother? Does he want to come along? Is it for the F1 or to spend time with you?. If it's the latter, you can do something much cheaper and more fun as brothers later on.\n\nFor adding him to the raffle: I wouldn't do that. He's your brother, he deserves a straight answer even if it is a no. It would also give a weird dynamic to the raffle if there's someone in there that you'd rather not bring along.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Add him to the raffle, but you don\u2019t have to draw his name. You are the raffle administrator after all and maybe your brother gets one ticket and your friends get 10, and leave it up to chance with skewed odds. I know a raffle implies fairness, but your parents are being unfair to you and tipping the scales. While somewhat dishonest, it might keep the peace.

Is she trying to force more brotherly togetherness on you? \n\nIf you can figure out what her ulterior motive is, and if you feel like it, you can offer something else that might placate her.  Take your brother out for the day t something you both like. Or offer childcare for a weekend day so she can get away. \n\nNot saying you *need* to do this, but it might be a way of getting her to stop pushing you to take your brother to Vegas. \n\nAlthough, it just occurred to me that she might be forcing a 13 year old on you to keep  you from getting into \"trouble\" in Vegas.
