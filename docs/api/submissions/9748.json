Vivian doesn\u2019t have any issues with bullies and enjoys socializing with people. But she hates waking up at 7:15, she hates listening to lectures in class, and she hates studying and homework, even for a subject that she\u2019s interested in. And there\u2019s frankly **NOTHING** wrong with that. She doesn\u2019t need to be a perfect student who loves school and homework.

The college is also located near a major city, where some of Vivian\u2019s other friends will be attending a different college but will still be in the area. I looked into the costs of this private college, the tuition is fairly affordable, but the \u201ccatch\u201d is that students are required to live on campus for all four years and the dorm costs are through the roof.\n\nI explained to Vivian that I will pay off all of her student debt if she goes to a community college first and then earns the grades to transfer to the private college (or any number of other colleges, if she is no longer interested in the private college.) But that I am not going to spend thousands of dollars when she\u2019s shown me thus far that she isn\u2019t emotionally committed to her studies and won\u2019t treat her education seriously.\n\nVivian and multiple others have told me that I am being unfair with the community college offer, because even though the cost of the private college is steep, I am still able to afford it.

And she said it was very beneficial in helping her transition from high school to a major college.)\n\nBut Vivian tells me that she hates school, studying, and lectures, even if she\u2019s interested in the subject.

This would be money down the drain.\n\nYour daughter has openly stated the key reason she picked this school is to be near friends.  She's openly stated that she does not want to put in the effort to be successful.\n\nSetting a threshold of \"demonstrate the bare minimum\" is reasonable.  If she can't make it at a local community college, she's sure as hell not making it at a private university.", "NTA. Your daughter won\u2019t understand this until she is about 30 though. Act accordingly.", "INFO: How are her grades?", "NTA she is going to waste her time and your money if she already hates school. Also she realizes that she can be kicked out of a private college for not doing work and going to class right? They have people that actually want to be there and earn a degree they don\u2019t have room for people who just want to be near their friends but no actually *go to college*.", "NTA at all. Has she even applied to this college? What are the chances of her getting in? They may waitlist her because of her grades and she might not have any choice but to go to a community college first. This is what happened to our son.  He only wanted to go to one college and they rejected him because of his grades.  He was devastated but he knew that going to a community college was going to help in the long run.  It got him used to getting up early, listening to lectures, actually studying and helped him grow up some.  And yes, we paid for his education and are still paying for him to get his masters right now.  Let her apply and see if she can even get in.  The college may make the decision for you.  Good luck!", "Have you had Vivian evaluated for ADHD? There are meds that make a huge difference in waking up early, listening to lectures, and studying. If she doesn\u2019t like school she\u2019s not going to like the community college either. If her grades aren\u2019t good, then you didn\u2019t need to be the asshole. The school would just not let her in. You could have stayed a neutral party and been there to comfort her and offer her alternatives. You needlessly made yourself the asshole in her eyes. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s a junior because we\u2019re well past application deadlines. So get her evaluated for ADHD and let her apply. A small, 4-year college could actually be a better environment for her than a community college because there are more discussion-based classes and fewer lecture classes and she can pick classes that interest her. \n\nThe other thing to consider is what does she want to do with her degree. Professional schools absolutely require a high GPA, like medical school, veterinary school, etc, so that\u2019s where you\u2019d want to advise her to not start school until she can guarantee to get her grades up. She wouldn\u2019t need to report community school grades unless she wanted to. But this is a NAH situation because you\u2019re trying to set her on the right path. As far as she\u2019s concerned, a year separated from her friends is going to be hard to catch up on. But that\u2019s a lot of money to spend if she\u2019s just going to sleep through all of her classes, which she absolutely can do in college. High school has a lot of structure, college does not. If she does have ADHD she is going to absolutely crash and burn without medication and learning how to manage symptoms.", "INFO\n\nThis is a very slippery slope because you're equating attitude with performance, not to mention pretending to be clairvoyant, and that's simply not fair. You have to hold all of you children to the same standards for your return largesse (paying for college). So my question is this: How are your daughter's actual grades in high school now? If they are as good as your direct-to-4-year-college kids, then you can't hold her kvetching against her (unless you want her to stop ever telling you her feelings for fear you'll hold them against her). A GPA threshold is objective and fair, and an easily-understandable goal for your daughter to understand.", "NTA. She doesn't want to study at this school, she wants to be near her friends to socialize on your dime. It doesn't matter if you can afford it, throwing money at an expensive place to live isn't wise.", "NTA. Treating all your kids fairly doesn\u2019t necessarily mean treating them all the same. This plan is a reasonable response both to Vivian\u2019s track record and to her stated reasons for wanting to go to that college. I absolutely agree that college is about more than just the academics, but it is first about the academics.", "NAH at this point, though I wouldn't think your way is the best approach. Your position is reasonable, but first, if she doesn't have the grades how is she even going to be accepted to this college? Maybe let her try and get the bad news from them herself. She'll have more motivation then to actually work at community college to try to transfer. \n\nAt this point, it's unlikely she'll suddenly change her ways at a community college she's not interested in going to. She wants to go where her friends are going. It would be more effective for you to set a yearly GPA minimum below which you will not pay for her education (assuming she gets admitted to that college). Maybe she'll pull it off, maybe she won't, but again it's on her to try to achieve.", "Clear NTA.", "Need more info\n\nIs your daughter doing poorly in school? If she isn't, I don't see why you gave her these terms. She was just honest with you.

My child doesn't like spending 8 hours a day in class just to come home and spend the rest of the night doing homework. My child is planning on going to college though. They have a plan for their future and even though they hate doing homework and studying, they are doing very well in school. You don't have to love doing those things to excel and know that some things have to be done.", "INFO\n\nIt seems to me like there might be other compromises. For example, if she doesn\u2019t make the grade she has to pay you back the tuition or some other consequence.\n\nAlso most colleges have ways you can opt out of the mandatory on campus restriction.  Have you looked into this?", "NTA - As a parent of an older teen (who also didn't like school), t think your plan is fair and sound. I have essentially done the same for my son.", "NTA. She has had zero interest. Whether you can afford it isn't relevant. What is relevant is that she thinks it's about further hanging out with friends. Wasting money unnecessarily. Many kids do community first as it saves on school cost.", "Nta but you do risk her harboring resentment for like the rest of her life. Ur not a dick, but there may be consequences, is all", "NTA most kids would be insanely appreciative if their parents did something like this for them.", "YTA. Let her go to the college of her choice. On the agreement that she has to keep her grades at some minimal acceptable level. What that is is up to you and your daughter to discuss. I'd suggest passing all of her courses - even just barely - is enough. \n\nYou'd be the asshole if you treat her differently than your other kids. \n\nYou are not really committing to 4 years of an expensive college (which you can afford anyway). If she fails, she will need to do something else and you won't have to pay anymore. If she succeeds, she will have done exactly what you'd hope she'd do anyway.", "Totally NTA. Your money, your choice how to spend it.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with acknowledging potential issues. \nWe actually have a rule in our house, you can go to CC and live at home and we will pay for it. Once you transfer to uni we will help but we aren\u2019t solely paying for it. If you choose uni straight out of HS you have to figure that out on your own. We believe too many kids go to uni and fuck off bc they aren\u2019t emotionally mature enough for it. BUT that being said, I have one kid whom I would pay for because she has always worked her ass off and has always wanted to do the same career since she was 5 and has never wavered. \nYou have to see each child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and take them both into consideration. \nFor us, that child we know will put uni to good use straight away. The rest, would need time to mature and truly figure out direction before spending that kind of money.", "Yeah soft YTA on this. I actually did go to community college and transfer to a four year so I could afford college. But my parents couldn\u2019t pay for tuition. But before I did that, I used the limited amount of money my extended family set aside for my education to go to cooking school. Everyone thought I was wasting the money but I learned so much from that experience. I learned to manage on my own, teamwork, responsibility. And that I wanted a desk job. I\u2019m very successful with my desk job these days. \n\nYou\u2019re taking away the choices that your other children had which seems pretty unfair to me since it\u2019s not for financial reasons. And in so doing you are forcing her to participate in an education mode that\u2019s exclusively about the parts she doesn\u2019t like. That seems like setting her up for failure to me. Private college is about more than lectures and homework. There\u2019s interest groups and international students and Greek life and charities and religious groups. There are a much wider variety of course options and more job experience opportunities. There\u2019s the simple issue of beginning to take care of yourself because you\u2019re away from home. If she hasn\u2019t had terrible grades or shown irresponsibility before, she should have the same opportunity as her siblings. If she screws it up she screw it up. But she needs to have the chance to find her sea legs.", "YTA. You say she complains a lot but what really matters is what she DOES. Does she get the grades to get admitted? If she does well enough at school to get admitted, you'd be the ass for holding her back based on your opinion of what she cares about. It would be perfectly reasonable to hold her to whatever grade deal you held her siblings too (eg keep Cs or move back to community college) but don't assume she'll fail because of her attitude towards highschool.

I\u2019d approach it differently- more along the lines of \u201caside from social reasons why do you want to go to *this* college? Do you know what you want to major in? Does this college offer a good program for that? I know you don\u2019t like waking up early for class-do you have a strategy regarding that? What classes do you want to take? Etc.\u201d less judging or imposing more questioning, cause if she does have good answers for all of those I\u2019d say do it. And if is just about applying, let her apply (she\u2019s have to answer at least some of those questions in the course of applying) and if she gets in then you can revisit this with her, but based on what you\u2019ve said about her interest in academics, it doesn\u2019t sound like a sure thing that she\u2019ll even get in.", "NTA but I wonder if a different approach might work better. Making the emphasis about her needing to prove herself and you not wanting to waste your money does come across as harsh and combative and sets up a her vs you scenario, when really you should be on the same team. Can you try to frame this more as being about helping her work out what she wants to do and not wanting her to be miserable in college? If you want to emphasize the money part, maybe frame it more as helping her work out the best way to use that resource so that it isn't all used up doing an expensive thing she night not even like and then there not be enough to do something different after if she changes her mind?", "NTA. She already hates all the aspects associated with college.  There is absolutely no justification to spend the tuition for a private school if she won't take her education seriously.  I think offering community college first, in this case, is a great middle ground.  If she completes gen ed requirements,  then talk.  \n\nHowever,  be aware that transferring to a community college to a four year school can be a major adjustment.  The courses at a community college,  even though they tranfer to the university,  might be easier.  Class sizes are much larger at a university which means less time with an instructor.  Expectations tend to be higher too from my experience.  Make sure she is prepared for the transition.", "NTA, your logic makes sense to me. What about a compromise where she can go to the private school, but if she fails even one class, then you stop paying, and she'll be back out of college?", "Maybe tell her she can take out loans and if she maintains a B GPA you will pay her loans but if she doesn\u2019t then she will have to pay the loans back on her own.

If you wanted to put conditions on funding for college, you should have made them clear to all children and applied them equally to all children. Your concerns are valid, but I think you're being a bit myopic about the bigger picture.\n\nIt sounds like being close to her friends is the most important criteria to Vivian. When you say \"go to community college first\", you're offering her a solution that doesn't meet the most important criteria for her.

So she\u2019ll spend about 30-45 hours per week working on class work, and that\u2019s if she is a fast worker. University is set up be like a full time job. She will have to implement time management skills and learn to cope with putting school work before hanging out with friends often because if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019ll fall behind. If she gets below a certain GPA the first semester, she will be in academic probation and usually have one semester to make a certain GPA and stay. If it does go up, she gets kicked out. \n\nShe needs to really ask herself if she is prepared for that when she doesn\u2019t even like school. If she still insists on going, I say let her. Pay as you normally would. If she fails out, that\u2019s when you can say ok, you will need to get a job and wait until you\u2019re 24 and an independent student if you want to go back to school, even CC.

Look, OP, based on Vivian\u2019s track record, I think it\u2019s fair to be worried that Vivian primarily wants to go to college for the social aspects/connections and won\u2019t be properly focused on the schoolwork. I\u2019ve done several rounds of higher education and am painfully aware of the expenses that come with it, so I absolutely understand your wariness. \n\nThat said, I think you should consider a few things that may weigh in favor of your daughter doing well in a university setting. \n\n1. She will have a moderate amount of control over her schedule. If one of the reasons why she hates hs is because she has to wake up at 7:15, she can try to avoid early morning classes. I think I had 2-3 classes during university that started between 8-8:50 but the rest began at 10 or later. \n\n2. The structure of hs emphasizes memorization, repetition, and regurgitation. I did very well in hs but also *hated* the fact that every single class had homework due the next day. It felt like a chore because it basically was. I was much happier in college when assignments became spaced out and I no longer felt like a hamster on a wheel. \n\n3. You say that she doesn\u2019t study even for classes she\u2019s interested in, but is she *really* interested in the topics she\u2019s learning? There\u2019s a difference between having a minor preference between two subjects and being truly passionate about something. I tutored a hs student for the SAT when I was in law school and her grades were\u2026 average. She did not seem interested in academics at all and I questioned how she would do in a university setting. To my surprise (and delight for her), she absolutely **thrived** in her major and is graduating this spring with close to a 4.0. She has made the Dean\u2019s List every semester so far, even during COVID. I\u2019ve obviously kept in touch with her over the years and she explained that once she was taking classes she was truly interested in, school came naturally to her. There\u2019s a chance Vivian will experience something similar. \n\nIn any event, regardless of her underlying motives (social), according to your post, this is the first time Vivian has shown a sincere interest in education. I think it would be a mistake to discourage that, even if your reasons are financially valid. It\u2019s unclear if Vivian is already a senior (in which case, her window to apply is almost over, anyway) but here\u2019s what I would do: tell her that she has to apply to at least 3 colleges even if they\u2019re all in the same city as the private one (if the only reason why she wants to go is to be close to her friend, this will become apparent). Tell her that you will pay for one year and if she maintains a 3.0+, you will continue. A semester is too short for many students to find their footing and if a year is financially feasible for you, I\u2019d give that to her. Tell her that if she decides she doesn\u2019t like college during that first year, she must tell you before second semester tuition is due. If she drops out midway through a semester and you lose money, you will expect her to reimburse you for that lost semester. This will force her to really think about whether she wants to take this on. \n\nMy advice would be different if you didn\u2019t have the means but since you do, I believe you should give her a chance. Good luck.", "NAH but you should sit down and talk to your daughter because something else may be going on. I HATED high school, never studied, had a GPA lower than a C, and finally dropped out and got my G.E.D. Mostly, I had ADHD and was bored. I also went to a CC for a semester or two and found it really difficult because it wasn't much different than high school. \n\nI'm now a college professor and going to the right college is what turned it around. I went to a flagship state school took a bunch of classes I like and for the first time, I had motivation to study and loved school so much I got a PhD and never left.\n\nMy brother on the other hand got straight A's, went to the same state school to study engineering, and dropped out. Neither hating high school nor doing well is predictive of how well someone will do in college. At all.\n\nMy recommendation is to at least take her on a college visit to this school to see what it's about.

If she is only coming at this from the social aspects, then you don't need to fund an adults social life.

Also agree with other posts that an evaluation for ADHD is a good idea. Girls are not diagnosed at all/ or only later because it presents differently. Understanding why you struggle and learning coping strategies with or without medications can make a big difference. College often makes a big difference because you choose your classes, can choose your professor, choose to never have morning classes unless it's a required course only offered in the AM..

Your logic is sound if you\u2019re dealing with a kid who just has no motivation and just wants to party. But have you had a long conversation with her about why she hates school so much? I hated school for as long as I can remember. What I didn\u2019t realize until I was older was that I have ADHD and having to sit quietly while a teacher talks for 45 minutes straight felt like actual torture. And I was so relieved to get home after dealing with it for 7 hours a day that the last thing I wanted to do was sit down and study and do homework. I actually really enjoy learning, but I was not capable of doing it in the typical way without help from medication.

But they are good for students who are self-motivated and self-directed...students who just want to take their classes so they can get their AA degree or transfer to a four-year college. These students aren't interested in campus life.  CC's aren't necessarily good for the student who gets hyped by campus life and the positive influences that come with that.\n\nThere are a lot of students who are in college who hate getting up for their 8:00am classes, but they do it because maybe their roommate has introduced them to a morning coffee ritual.  Or maybe they have an hour block at 10:00am where they can catch a cat nap in the library.  That was the thing that blew my mind when I was in college.  It was socially acceptable for me to take a nap--multiple naps!--in the middle of the day.  Everyone else was doing it too!  It's how we were able to stay up late studying and having fun while making it to our morning classes.  Maybe if Vivian had scheduled nap time in high school, she'd like high school more!\n\nIt kind of sounds like you want to make life harder for your daughter just because she made the mistake of being honest with you about not liking school.  Not liking high school doesn't translate into not liking college.  And not liking college doesn't translate into doing poorly in college.  If she maintains a B/C average in college, she'll graduate with the same degree as her summa cum laude classmates.  \n\nI say give her the same chance you gave her siblings.

There are lots of things you could do other than force her to go to a CC. my parents did that with my sister and my cousin was forced to (I had a full ride) and I strongly believe (as do they, now) that it impeded their social and mental developments by being an extension of high school -- which you already said is not an environment your daughter thrives in.", "NTA\n\nI think that it is interesting what you say about your daughter's 24 hour clock.  There is more and more evidence that early morning starts do not suit many young people.

The point is whether or not they're performing to satisfaction.  She can complain, but still know she has to do it.\n\nIf it's simply that she's venting, then you're TA.

Otherwise, she'll need to prove her commitment to school at a cheaper institution.

You're likely to find that most if not all of their credits don't transfer to a private college.

It sounds like she resents the suggestion, but offering her as much support as she needs to succeed in community college could go a long way.

I hated community college, hated still living at home, and the program I was going for was not at all what I was expecting. Plus it was during the recession and seemed like a waste, so I just dropped out and went from part time to full time at work. If I had been given the opportunity to go to a four year university and spread my wings a bit, I would have been motivated to work harder.
