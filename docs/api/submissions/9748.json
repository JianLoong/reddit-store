Vivian doesn\u2019t have any issues with bullies and enjoys socializing with people. But she hates waking up at 7:15, she hates listening to lectures in class, and she hates studying and homework, even for a subject that she\u2019s interested in. And there\u2019s frankly **NOTHING** wrong with that. She doesn\u2019t need to be a perfect student who loves school and homework.

The college is also located near a major city, where some of Vivian\u2019s other friends will be attending a different college but will still be in the area. I looked into the costs of this private college, the tuition is fairly affordable, but the \u201ccatch\u201d is that students are required to live on campus for all four years and the dorm costs are through the roof.\n\nI explained to Vivian that I will pay off all of her student debt if she goes to a community college first and then earns the grades to transfer to the private college (or any number of other colleges, if she is no longer interested in the private college.) But that I am not going to spend thousands of dollars when she\u2019s shown me thus far that she isn\u2019t emotionally committed to her studies and won\u2019t treat her education seriously.\n\nVivian and multiple others have told me that I am being unfair with the community college offer, because even though the cost of the private college is steep, I am still able to afford it.

And she said it was very beneficial in helping her transition from high school to a major college.)\n\nBut Vivian tells me that she hates school, studying, and lectures, even if she\u2019s interested in the subject.

This would be money down the drain.\n\nYour daughter has openly stated the key reason she picked this school is to be near friends.  She's openly stated that she does not want to put in the effort to be successful.\n\nSetting a threshold of \"demonstrate the bare minimum\" is reasonable.  If she can't make it at a local community college, she's sure as hell not making it at a private university.", "NTA. Your daughter won\u2019t understand this until she is about 30 though. Act accordingly.", "INFO: How are her grades?", "NTA she is going to waste her time and your money if she already hates school. Also she realizes that she can be kicked out of a private college for not doing work and going to class right? They have people that actually want to be there and earn a degree they don\u2019t have room for people who just want to be near their friends but no actually *go to college*.", "NTA at all. Has she even applied to this college? What are the chances of her getting in? They may waitlist her because of her grades and she might not have any choice but to go to a community college first. This is what happened to our son.  He only wanted to go to one college and they rejected him because of his grades.  He was devastated but he knew that going to a community college was going to help in the long run.  It got him used to getting up early, listening to lectures, actually studying and helped him grow up some.  And yes, we paid for his education and are still paying for him to get his masters right now.  Let her apply and see if she can even get in.  The college may make the decision for you.  Good luck!", "Have you had Vivian evaluated for ADHD? There are meds that make a huge difference in waking up early, listening to lectures, and studying. If she doesn\u2019t like school she\u2019s not going to like the community college either. If her grades aren\u2019t good, then you didn\u2019t need to be the asshole. The school would just not let her in. You could have stayed a neutral party and been there to comfort her and offer her alternatives. You needlessly made yourself the asshole in her eyes. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s a junior because we\u2019re well past application deadlines. So get her evaluated for ADHD and let her apply. A small, 4-year college could actually be a better environment for her than a community college because there are more discussion-based classes and fewer lecture classes and she can pick classes that interest her. \n\nThe other thing to consider is what does she want to do with her degree. Professional schools absolutely require a high GPA, like medical school, veterinary school, etc, so that\u2019s where you\u2019d want to advise her to not start school until she can guarantee to get her grades up. She wouldn\u2019t need to report community school grades unless she wanted to. But this is a NAH situation because you\u2019re trying to set her on the right path. As far as she\u2019s concerned, a year separated from her friends is going to be hard to catch up on. But that\u2019s a lot of money to spend if she\u2019s just going to sleep through all of her classes, which she absolutely can do in college. High school has a lot of structure, college does not. If she does have ADHD she is going to absolutely crash and burn without medication and learning how to manage symptoms.", "INFO\n\nThis is a very slippery slope because you're equating attitude with performance, not to mention pretending to be clairvoyant, and that's simply not fair. You have to hold all of you children to the same standards for your return largesse (paying for college). So my question is this: How are your daughter's actual grades in high school now? If they are as good as your direct-to-4-year-college kids, then you can't hold her kvetching against her (unless you want her to stop ever telling you her feelings for fear you'll hold them against her). A GPA threshold is objective and fair, and an easily-understandable goal for your daughter to understand.", "NTA. She doesn't want to study at this school, she wants to be near her friends to socialize on your dime. It doesn't matter if you can afford it, throwing money at an expensive place to live isn't wise.", "NTA. Treating all your kids fairly doesn\u2019t necessarily mean treating them all the same. This plan is a reasonable response both to Vivian\u2019s track record and to her stated reasons for wanting to go to that college. I absolutely agree that college is about more than just the academics, but it is first about the academics.", "NAH at this point, though I wouldn't think your way is the best approach. Your position is reasonable, but first, if she doesn't have the grades how is she even going to be accepted to this college? Maybe let her try and get the bad news from them herself. She'll have more motivation then to actually work at community college to try to transfer. \n\nAt this point, it's unlikely she'll suddenly change her ways at a community college she's not interested in going to. She wants to go where her friends are going. It would be more effective for you to set a yearly GPA minimum below which you will not pay for her education (assuming she gets admitted to that college). Maybe she'll pull it off, maybe she won't, but again it's on her to try to achieve.", "Clear NTA.", "Need more info\n\nIs your daughter doing poorly in school? If she isn't, I don't see why you gave her these terms. She was just honest with you.

My child doesn't like spending 8 hours a day in class just to come home and spend the rest of the night doing homework. My child is planning on going to college though. They have a plan for their future and even though they hate doing homework and studying, they are doing very well in school. You don't have to love doing those things to excel and know that some things have to be done.", "INFO\n\nIt seems to me like there might be other compromises. For example, if she doesn\u2019t make the grade she has to pay you back the tuition or some other consequence.\n\nAlso most colleges have ways you can opt out of the mandatory on campus restriction.  Have you looked into this?", "NTA - As a parent of an older teen (who also didn't like school), t think your plan is fair and sound. I have essentially done the same for my son.", "NTA. She has had zero interest. Whether you can afford it isn't relevant. What is relevant is that she thinks it's about further hanging out with friends. Wasting money unnecessarily.

Ur not a dick, but there may be consequences, is all", "NTA most kids would be insanely appreciative if their parents did something like this for them.", "YTA. Let her go to the college of her choice. On the agreement that she has to keep her grades at some minimal acceptable level. What that is is up to you and your daughter to discuss. I'd suggest passing all of her courses - even just barely - is enough. \n\nYou'd be the asshole if you treat her differently than your other kids. \n\nYou are not really committing to 4 years of an expensive college (which you can afford anyway). If she fails, she will need to do something else and you won't have to pay anymore. If she succeeds, she will have done exactly what you'd hope she'd do anyway.", "Totally NTA. Your money, your choice how to spend it.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with acknowledging potential issues. \nWe actually have a rule in our house, you can go to CC and live at home and we will pay for it. Once you transfer to uni we will help but we aren\u2019t solely paying for it. If you choose uni straight out of HS you have to figure that out on your own. We believe too many kids go to uni and fuck off bc they aren\u2019t emotionally mature enough for it. BUT that being said, I have one kid whom I would pay for because she has always worked her ass off and has always wanted to do the same career since she was 5 and has never wavered. \nYou have to see each child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and take them both into consideration. \nFor us, that child we know will put uni to good use straight away. The rest, would need time to mature and truly figure out direction before spending that kind of money.", "Yeah soft YTA on this. I actually did go to community college and transfer to a four year so I could afford college. But my parents couldn\u2019t pay for tuition. But before I did that, I used the limited amount of money my extended family set aside for my education to go to cooking school. Everyone thought I was wasting the money but I learned so much from that experience. I learned to manage on my own, teamwork, responsibility. And that I wanted a desk job. I\u2019m very successful with my desk job these days. \n\nYou\u2019re taking away the choices that your other children had which seems pretty unfair to me since it\u2019s not for financial reasons. And in so doing you are forcing her to participate in an education mode that\u2019s exclusively about the parts she doesn\u2019t like. That seems like setting her up for failure to me. Private college is about more than lectures and homework. There\u2019s interest groups and international students and Greek life and charities and religious groups. There are a much wider variety of course options and more job experience opportunities. There\u2019s the simple issue of beginning to take care of yourself because you\u2019re away from home. If she hasn\u2019t had terrible grades or shown irresponsibility before, she should have the same opportunity as her siblings. If she screws it up she screw it up. But she needs to have the chance to find her sea legs.", "YTA. You say she complains a lot but what really matters is what she DOES. Does she get the grades to get admitted? If she does well enough at school to get admitted, you'd be the ass for holding her back based on your opinion of what she cares about. It would be perfectly reasonable to hold her to whatever grade deal you held her siblings too (eg keep Cs or move back to community college) but don't assume she'll fail because of her attitude towards highschool.

I\u2019d approach it differently- more along the lines of \u201caside from social reasons why do you want to go to *this* college? Do you know what you want to major in? Does this college offer a good program for that? I know you don\u2019t like waking up early for class-do you have a strategy regarding that? What classes do you want to take? Etc.\u201d less judging or imposing more questioning, cause if she does have good answers for all of those I\u2019d say do it.

Making the emphasis about her needing to prove herself and you not wanting to waste your money does come across as harsh and combative and sets up a her vs you scenario, when really you should be on the same team. Can you try to frame this more as being about helping her work out what she wants to do and not wanting her to be miserable in college? If you want to emphasize the money part, maybe frame it more as helping her work out the best way to use that resource so that it isn't all used up doing an expensive thing she night not even like and then there not be enough to do something different after if she changes her mind?", "NTA. She already hates all the aspects associated with college.  There is absolutely no justification to spend the tuition for a private school if she won't take her education seriously.  I think offering community college first, in this case, is a great middle ground.  If she completes gen ed requirements,  then talk.  \n\nHowever,  be aware that transferring to a community college to a four year school can be a major adjustment.  The courses at a community college,  even though they tranfer to the university,  might be easier.  Class sizes are much larger at a university which means less time with an instructor.  Expectations tend to be higher too from my experience.  Make sure she is prepared for the transition.", "NTA, your logic makes sense to me. What about a compromise where she can go to the private school, but if she fails even one class, then you stop paying, and she'll be back out of college?", "Maybe tell her she can take out loans and if she maintains a B GPA you will pay her loans but if she doesn\u2019t then she will have to pay the loans back on her own.

If you wanted to put conditions on funding for college, you should have made them clear to all children and applied them equally to all children. Your concerns are valid, but I think you're being a bit myopic about the bigger picture.\n\nIt sounds like being close to her friends is the most important criteria to Vivian. When you say \"go to community college first\", you're offering her a solution that doesn't meet the most important criteria for her.

Picking what school based off of her friends is a huge red flag. Huge. Esp if she doesnt have the grades & hasnt shown an interest. But there is a positive. It just might be the thing that encourages her to go & take it seriously. \n If she does go & you agree to pay, i would make an agreement that if her grades drop below \"x\", you wont pay for the next semester.", "It would be so much cheaper to just subsidize your daughter living in another city for 4 years to hang out with her friends than it would be to pay for her college so that she can do exactly what she wants without the lie of pursuing education.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She wants to go to college to hang out with her friends for four years at your expense, not to undertake any form of study. \n\nAnd tbh I think she\u2019ll be in for a shock, if her friends are going there with a scholarship, they\u2019re prob not going to be wanting to hang out and piss college up the wall, which she will.", "NTA.  My daughter is 17 and graduating this year and HATES school. I told her the same thing. She understands where we are coming from.", "NTA. I wasn\u2019t a fan of school when I graduated high school, but I still I went to a community college. I ended up stopping classes because I just wasn\u2019t getting good enough grades (Not failing, just not good: c average), didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do, and was too focused on hanging out with friends. When I decided to go after a 3 year break, I went straight to a 4 year university and it vastly different from HS and somewhat different from CC. \n\nYou need to sit down and explain how university works. Right now as a HS student, she is probably taking 2 core courses and then electives (you know one semester math and science and the other English and history). Get her to take stock of how much time she spends on her work in those classes.\n\nThen tell her, to graduate in 4 years from a university, she is going to need to be taking 15 credit hours (possibly 16 if she has a lab) that is 5 classes per semester (6 if there is a lab) or 12 credit hours (four classes) fall and spring semester and 6 credit hours (two classes) over the summer.\n\nThen tell her the instructors will expect her to spend about 2-3 hours per credit hour taken per week studying and working on class work. So she\u2019ll spend about 30-45 hours per week working on class work, and that\u2019s if she is a fast worker. University is set up be like a full time job. She will have to implement time management skills and learn to cope with putting school work before hanging out with friends often because if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019ll fall behind. If she gets below a certain GPA the first semester, she will be in academic probation and usually have one semester to make a certain GPA and stay. If it does go up, she gets kicked out. \n\nShe needs to really ask herself if she is prepared for that when she doesn\u2019t even like school. If she still insists on going, I say let her. Pay as you normally would. If she fails out, that\u2019s when you can say ok, you will need to get a job and wait until you\u2019re 24 and an independent student if you want to go back to school, even CC. This will allow her to apply for financial aid without having to use your income and all loans will be solely in her name.\n\nIf you do the above, you gave her a chance to go to university with her friends and succeed. She just chose not to.", "NTA.

It's amazing when they do, but you aren't obligated to.\n\nAt the same token, in my culture, our parents pay (but with the expectation that when they are older, we will take care of them accordingly as well).\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say here is that if you expect to financially dependant on her in some way in the future (it doesn't sound like you do) then you should pay. If you don't expect to be financially dependant on her in the future, the you aren't family-duty/anticipated-reciprocity obligated to (I really hope that makes more sense than I think it does.)\n\nBut be warned. She will forever see this as \"dad helped my siblings and not me\" unless you very clearly explain to her (and the rest of the family) the reasoning behind why you paid for the older kids and are giving her conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: clarification", "I don\u2019t think community college will necessarily prove she is ready.

I truly think my life would have been different. My life is good, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the experiences i would have had and opportunities would have been very different if I got to go where I wanted. \nAnother option, OP, is maybe tell your child that they can go but if they don\u2019t meet a 3.0 (or whatever GPA you deem fair) after the first semester, they have to switch to community. \nYou are assuming they can\u2019t do it based on HS. They are different worlds! You can afford it, they want to go. Maybe just come up with criteria and make sure they know how to access the resources if a tutor or other help is needed.", "Or chat to her about how if she wants to be in that city maybe it\u2019s possible without doing that college. Like exactly what is it she\u2019s looking for? If she wants to do something more hands on maybe there are apprenticeships in that area and the college fund can be used to help support her in that. \n\nOr if she knows she hates school but it\u2019s important for her to have a degree then that\u2019s fine too. My sister was in that camp and did great. She didn\u2019t enjoy the studying but she wanted the opportunities it would give her.", "I agree she may have ADHD because she says she struggles even when she likes the subject and it seems she does like to learn but is more stimulated in an environment when she is sharing it as a social experience rather than notions. (Also, I dont see why she would choose to continue school just to be with her friends if she hated schools Fully and not just some parts pf it that require organization). Talking to a specialist may help.\nThis said (and mind you I'm not saying you're wrong because I know a lot of people share the experience you described) I want to state for me was the opposite. High school was so structured, I did well only in the subjects I liked and suffered through the others, in university I discovered the lack of structure and Gave myself one that fitted my needs and I did so much better and so well because I could approach the subjects I loved with a structure that helped me give my best and I wasn't grinding my teeth through. I know not everyone is like that but I always see the opposite said so I wanted to share thar sometimes the shock of no structure ACTUALLY is beneficial for ADHD.", "Seems like he did or at least got the idea from one of his daughters because he said one of his kids chose the CC first and transfer credits to 4 year and said it was very beneficial in preparing for 4 year.", "Well said. OP you are doing the right thing. NTA", "I agree with this solution. While it does sound like the daughter would rather go to college to hang out with her friends, she should at least be given a chance. If she is able to get through her classes while hanging out with her friends, it doesn't really matter if she hates doing the school work. If she just hangs out for a semester and doesn't pass any classes then she'll have to transfer. But don't punish her before even giving her a chance.", "[removed]", "> sometimes the shock of no structure ACTUALLY is beneficial for ADHD\n\nThis was my experience. I needed to break all the structure I'd learned to poorly adapt to in order to get by, so I could actually engage productively with school or work. I also needed to be free from listening to most of the bad advice I was receiving on strategies that didn't work for me, and trust in myself and my ability to hyperfixate on things like I did with video games and other interests, so I could productively learn.\n\nI bounced around a lot of jobs in my 20s, but after going back to finish university I've settled on a decent career path as a software developer/data scientist.

The fact that you have other parents telling you you're selfish for not wanting to spend money on a private, or any, university when your daughter is demonstrably not interested in academics is asinine.
