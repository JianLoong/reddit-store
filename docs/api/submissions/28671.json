If you didn\u2019t see the first part [This is it](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ockUG23gmU). \n\nNow for an update.\n\nFirst- to all the people concerned with my dogs diet, thank you, I also got nervous when I got a few pm\u2019s about how vets are basically bullshitting when they talk about what they know about diet. I called my vet to ask what the deal was and if their food really is safe, and they sent me their credentials for canine nutrition. So worry no more, they\u2019re in good hands.\n\nSecond- there seemed to be some confusion which honestly is a little funny. I\u2019m the 18 year old. My roommate is 26, almost 27.\n\nThird- my dogs are microchipped and have been for a few months (since they were old enough to get them safely) and they\u2019re registered to me so don\u2019t worry about that, but again thank you so much for your concern it meant a lot that people were so helpful. \n\nFourth- My lease is up end of November, I told her i\u2019d be moving out and to find a new roommate. I already have a place lined up with two of my friends, the house itself is smaller but the property is larger so the dogs will have more room to run around!\n\nFifth- Please stop saying I don\u2019t have the ability to take care of my pets. I do. I schedule things around them. Like I said in the edit, I only felt comfortable moving things around AFTER she OFFERED to help me. \n\nAnd lastly- I spoke to her friends. I took a few of them out to lunch today and they told me she said that I yelled at her after she gave them the wrong food. They believed it because admittedly, I am every particular about what they eat but that\u2019s mostly because as I said to someone in the replies, one of my dogs has some stomach issues. I cleared it up with them and they apologized. All but one of them which honestly I don\u2019t care too much, i\u2019ll be moving out and won\u2019t ever talk to them again most likely anyways.\n\nThank you so much for all your concern, i\u2019m so thankful to have gotten this much engagement with my post. Have a great rest of your day\u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1696978583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174yrjk/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_18f_roommate_26f_for/", "score": 53, "replies": ["I will never understand people who claim to want to care for an animal and then allow them to go hungry or not be able to go out and walk or etc., just because the people get lazy. I'm glad the puppers are doing well. By the way, you should give them treats. They have reliably informed me that they've never had treats and always wanted them and that you must give them all the treats. LOL.", "My cat SCREAMS at me if his food dish is half empty, and Lord forgive you because he won't if you are a minute late on his refill times.  How on earth roommate didn't notice two hungry pups and think \"oh maybe I should feed these guys?!\" Is beyond me", "It seems to say something about the character of your roommate that not only did she not seem to be bothered by her failures to follow through on her promises, but that she lied about the cause of the confrontation after the third incident.\n\nThe lying is a good sign she knew that her failures to follow through were wrong. If she'd thought she'd done nothing wrong, then there'd have been no reason to lie. The true story of the situation would have been good enough (for whatever reason she was telling them about it). That she did lie says she knew that the truth would get an unfavorable reaction from her friends.\n\nMoving out when you have the chance is definitely a wise move. If she'll lie on something like this, odds are pretty good that she'd lie on other things too.", "My cat is the same.  He hollers until I hop to it.  He gets fed 3 times a day, and won't tolerate 5 minutes deviation from his schedule!\n\nHe knows he's the boss and I am just the staff around here.\n\nI can't even imagine what two non-fed dogs would do, but I sure wouldn't want to witness it!", "my cat bites", "Hell, my dogs will get in my space and go from grumbling, warbling, to barking if it's near their food times; I've had my head stomped on more than once when I've tried to sleep in. I really don't get how you can forget to feed most animals because they'll let you know as best they can.", "My cats try to kill me when they are hungry. They want in front of me meowing and are constantly underfoot."]}
