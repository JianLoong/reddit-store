I had a good stable career in an international company prior my maternity leave, and my income and my husband\u2019s income were on the same level. However, 3,5 yrs ago I left my workplace for maternity leave. Initially I was planning on taking 1,5 years off, maximum 2, and then return to my workplace.\n\nPandemic hit, and when I wanted to return to my work (after 1,5 years of ml), I was informed that my job is no longer existing. It was disappointing, I was good in my field.\n\nMy husband told me that our kid is too little, and I should stay at home for a little longer. I did. \nA year had passed, things at home became strained. We started arguing more. Husband was now not happy that I stayed at home, but instead of talking to me normally about it, he started making snarky comments like \u201care you always gonna be at home now?\u201d \u201cAm I supposed to pay for you all the time?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have your own money\u201d etc. Mind you, we live in MY apartment.\n\nIt was very stressful. I gained a lot of weight because of that.\nI have been actively looking for about 6 months now. No results.\n\nA few months ago, just to get the nagging feeling that I\u2019m a \u201cfreeloader\u201d, as told by my husband, off my back, I got a remote job which turned out to be A LOT of work and very little pay. The job is nowhere near my field or the field that I\u2019m interested in. I was working for about 3 weeks, when my husband made a scene of me not cooking him dinner every night. To say that I was annoyed is an understatement. I said that even if I work from home, doesn\u2019t mean that I have as much free time as I used to. And that he\u2019s a grown ass man and can heat something up or cook something himself. Heck, he could have just ordered takeout. I told him that I got that job because of his nagging, and if he\u2019s now unhappy with it, he can go to hell. I said that I\u2019m done with him and with that relationship. He begged me for forgiveness, admitted that he was wrong and said that he would work on himself and on our relationship and so on. I agreed.\n\nLong story short, my husband had been telling me to quit and that I deserved better for a while. I talked to him and he encouraged me to quit, told me that he supports my decision and I should find a job that will make me happy. I quit.\n\nThat happened a little more than a week ago. I am actively searching for a new job, i have a few interviews scheduled for the next week. Today my husband told me that he hates the fact that I am at home, when he has to go to the office everyday. That I will never find a job and so on. I was fed up with that shit. I yelled at him that he is an insensitive jerk, that he\u2019s a liar and that he never supported me. Now he\u2019s not talking to me and acting upset. Am I the asshole? Am I wrong? I have a feeling that I am not, but he\u2019s not talking to me, and I feel like I\u2019m an asshole and I shouldn\u2019t have quit that stupid job", "created_utc": 1667653331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymtba9/aita_for_quitting_my_job_and_yelling_at_my_husband/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He loved to use it against me, while also making sure that I had the full responsibility of childcare, home care (including all repairs and maintenance and cleaning), and all food preparation.  Nothing I did was ever enough.  I didn\u2019t \u2018contribute\u2019 enough, despite the fact that my full time care for every single part of our lives that wasn\u2019t his career enabled him to grow said career in spectacular ways.

He wasn\u2019t wrong long term, but what other choice did I have at that point, except to put up and shut up or make big changes.  \nHe would not do counseling and he wouldn\u2019t do therapy.

I see this often, the WFH person is often expected to still do 95% of the house and child care which makes no sense to me.  But I've read countless \"My husband works from home but seems unable to work AND take care of our 2 at-home kids, get #3, the oldest, to/from school, do all the appointments, cut the grass, do laundry, all day and have dinner ready when I come home\" posts.  \n\nYour weight gain has nothing to do with anything.  Join the club of those who comfort-ate during the height of the virus while stuck at home, sigh.  **The issue is your husband's anger** outbursts.  He can't have it both ways.  There has to be a medium.  He can't explode every time he wants his opinion heard.  I DO understand resentment that builds up from working away from home and having a very hard, stressful job, BTDT for year after year.  I understand the feeling of knowing that others depend on your taking crap all day from 30 different bosses and employees that outrank you, just so your kids and partner can be at home all day, not being pushed in 40 different directions and scared to lose your job.  You come home, they want to tell you all about what they saw on the Sephora site (sorry lol had to do it), what they saw on TV, how they got bored, how they and the child went to the park and had a fun time, what the child did (things the working dude seldom gets to experience)...stuff the working stiff never gets to do during daytime hours.  There is a bit of jealousy, envy, and yes, even anger.   But he needs to get a grip, go work out at the gym before heading home, take a walk, something to release that pent-up WORK anger before he gets home.  p.s.  I used to go casting at a nearby lake for 30 mts before heading home several times a week, not really fishing but rather just being my myself and moving around and being near the water.  Husband needs to learn/train himself to not come home angry all the time.  Husband needs to learn how to actually have a conversation without screaming.  Husband needs to vocalize what is bothering him before he lets it build up to this point.     NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI have nothing to add that hasn't already been said. Holy crap. Throw the whole man away.", "NTA it's obvious your husband wants you to work and wait on him hand and foot.\n\nYou deserve better. Your husband has zero intentions on treating you well,he only apologized because you threatened to leave. Now that you're not threatening to leave, he back on his bs", "NTA\n\nYour husband is saying one thing then punishing you for doing what he says.  He is in the wrong and you are not the AH.", "You gotta lose some weight: divorce the husband. NTA", "NTA.
