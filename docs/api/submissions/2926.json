As an autistic person myself, what you did/how you organize makes 100% sense to me. It\u2019s logical & helps with moments of brain fog/overstimulation. As a trauma survivor and autistic who spent a long time masking/learning social stigmas before late diagnosis, I understand why someone would feel anxious by this interaction.
