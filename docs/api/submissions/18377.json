When I was around 8, my parents divorced and my life and by the age of 10, my small family usually consisted of me, my dad, his new wife, and my 1 year old younger half sister. Although I will credit my mom for being a great co parent and a mother, she had her flaws. They divorced on good terms but she really resented him after. \n\nTo break these down and get to the main part, I\u2019ll speed these parts up. When I was 14, my mom started seeing this girl, who was a fairly nice looking girl for her age. It wasn\u2019t that really long until they started hitting it off. When I turned 15, my dad passed away by a heart attack. I fell into a depression and I\u2019m still fighting these demons now. While my mom didn\u2019t have any care for her ex husband, she didn\u2019t acknowledge my pain as her son that is going through loosing his own father. \n\nIt was most dad\u2019s wife, who\u2019ll I\u2019ll call Krystie who helped me through it. Seeing her mourn, I felt connected and could relate to her through our same loss of losing someone so dear to us. And typing this, that was what made us so close.\n\nBack to SM, she wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad person, neither was my mom. I had more closer relationship with my mom than SM. SM always tried to get close to me but it was like we didn\u2019t know how to connect to each other. And to be honest, I missed it when it was just me and my mom. But that\u2019s my mom life and I agreed to myself that I won\u2019t meddle with her happiness. \n\nFast forward to last week, I was given the privilege to speak at my high school graduation after receiving top scores and having multiple scholarships. My whole family was happy and they all attended. During my speech, I briefly mentioned my mom and Krystie, thanking them and stating that they both were like mothers to me and I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today without them. While reading my speech, I looked up to see my family and I got the most disgusted look from mom and SM. \n\nWhen I got to mom\u2019s house, she had put me on blast for not mentioning my SM, saying how hurt SM is for not even being mentioned or acknowledged. She also said SM sacrificed so much for me when she had never done squat. SM also started going after Krystie and said how she\u2019s also just a step mom to me and she shouldn\u2019t get these exceptions and better treatment. What crossed the line was talking about dad but I won\u2019t say, all I can say it ended with me now staying with Krystie and helping with my half sister.\n\nEDIT: wow, I just want to thank everyone for just coming out their way to just comfort me even if it was a simple, \u2018congratulations\u2019 on my achievements\u2026and I\u2019m just happy, really.", "created_utc": 1685280085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u0c5z/aita_for_not_including_my_step_mom_in_my/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned the people who you felt helped you in your life.  Since you really didn't have much to say about SM, not too sure why your mother thought she should have been mentioned, other than she is probably quite protective of her partner and doesn't like her feeling bad.", "Nta.  Those 2 idiots, mom and sm, can believe whatever they like but it does not mean you have to believe it too. You have the right to thank the people who were there for for you.  Do not put up with the criticism.  As soon as those 2 start just shut it down.  Refuse to participate in the conversation and leave the room.  You did nothing wrong. Stand up for yourself.", "INFO/Clarification because I am an idiot:\n\nDid I read this right? You mentioned your mom and your dad's wife, but not the mom's GF? Mom is pissed you didn't mention GF?", "Thanks. For awhile I thought it was my introverted personality that blamed myself for not being able to have a socially good relationship with SM.", "Ah yes, attention seekers -_- \nThank you!", "I guess it really is :/ but yeah I could say my mom didn\u2019t try to think of me at all.", "Thank you so much!", "SM and Krystie barley like each other so agree, definitely there was jealousy and competition\u2026", ":) thank you, I really needed this", "Thank you x2 :)", "Definitely. Thank you", "Right!", "Appreciate it :)", "It\u2019s hard to say but seeing SM try to create a relationship with me yet only want to involved when I gain something successful is difficult", "Thanks :)", "Thank you!", "You\u2019re right, I continue looking forward with my future with these countless school opportunities. Thank you!", "It was your graduation. It wasn't about your mom's new girlfriend who hasn't been in your life very long. She also failed you as a parent. You lost your other parent. It doesn't matter if she had a great relationship with him or not. You are her child who lost one of your parents. It's her job to check on you to make sure you are ok. To make sure you have someone to talk to if you need it.", "Sweetie, you just need to take what they say with a pinch of salt. Or maybe a whole tub. \n\nThere\u2019s no point in arguing with them, because the argument wouldn\u2019t change any hearts or minds. \n\nIt sounds like Krystie has cared more for you whilst your dad was alive. Then when he passed, you two had this connection; your shared grief. Mom isn\u2019t going to understand in the way Krystie does, because mom wasn\u2019t married to dad when he passed. At the very least, she should be there for you in your grief, supporting her child, regardless of feelings towards dad or Krystie. It\u2019s her **child** that is grieving the loss of his father, and she should be aware of that, and it should matter to her. \n\nArguing over mom\u2019s gf is going to get you nowhere. It\u2019s an endless circle. So it\u2019s pointless. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I\u2019d pay it no mind and get on with my life. I\u2019d go and get a job that I\u2019ve worked hard for. I\u2019d build my life and surround myself with those who love me. If that includes mom and her gf, great. If it doesn\u2019t, then maybe it\u2019s not such a big loss. Only you can decide that. \n\nGood luck with the future, and congrats on your achievements. You\u2019re entitled to celebrate your success with whomever you desire.", "Thank you, really:)", "Agree :( although how angered I was after the things they said to tick me off, you just sometimes gotta be the bigger person and I didn\u2019t want to push the gap between us more. You\u2019re too kind, thank you so much\u2026", "Aw honey. <Hugs> from an internet stranger \ud83e\udd70\n\nIt\u2019s probably best to let people calm down. Cooler heads will prevail. You still want mom in your life, and don\u2019t won\u2019t to force this issue because it may worsen the divide. I totally get that. \n\nYou just go and do what you\u2019ve got to do. Keep those you love close. Get a job, a home of your own, just go and build your life. Your mom will be in it if she wants to be. Just don\u2019t close the door on her, and give her the chance to realise the error of her ways. \n\nYou never know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors. Whether SM is trying to drive a wedge intentionally, or whether she\u2019s trying to get your mom to see sense. You don\u2019t know the inner workings of their relationship. I don\u2019t either, so it\u2019s not for me to judge. You just have to have hope, and don\u2019t say something you\u2019ll live to regret. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that this happened, but don\u2019t let that moment of that day ruin your future. It\u2019s just one moment in time, and there are many more better moments to come. Trust an old (40) lady. You do you, and welcome mom with open arms if she comes to you. The fact is, you never know how many tomorrows people have left, so it\u2019s better to go out there and enjoy them, than to sit and stew in your sadness. And you know what they say about being bitter; it\u2019s like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to d i e.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations on all your hard work. Your mom and SM need a basic tutorial on relationships. Krystal has been your other mother more than half your life. SM has been there for 4 yrs.", "You\u2019re a great person, kiddo. You\u2019re gonna do amazing. I bet your dad is really proud of you. You should be proud of yourself too <3", "NTA. The way your mom\u2019s family is treating you is terrible. Trying to force a close relationship without putting any effort in is ridiculous. You were a grieving kid who needed support. It\u2019s not your job to emotionally prop up your mum and step mum\u2019s egos.", "Firstly, congratulations on your graduation! \n\nSecondly, NTA. When you get a chance to speak at such an important moment in your life, you're bound to thank the people who were there for you, cared for you and made you feel heard. I can't even imagine what the loss of a parent feels like but the fact that Krystie was empathetic and helped you cope speaks a lot about how she is a person and the fact that mother chose to be bitter and ignorant speaks about her. Mom and SM can yell and cry but it doesn't change your feelings towards them and shouldn't either. \n\nHope you're doing well in your new living situation.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you have Krystie in your life, especially when your mom has failed you so hard.\n\nKrystie has been in your life since you were ~9yo, and was there for you while you were grieving your father\u2019s death when even your mom wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnd you know, even if your mom\u2019s wife had been in your life the same amount if time - sometimes we just don\u2019t click with people and a closeness never develops. As long as you still treat them with basic human decency you\u2019re fine. \n\nThem being pissed you didn\u2019t include her in the speech just smacks of being pissed you\u2019re not one of someone\u2019s favorite people. Trying to compete with someone else to be a favorite always turns out badly. (And if that is happening within a marriage it\u2019s probably time to consider a divorce.) The lie would also be frustrating as hell.", "NTA, your speech, your decision.", "The fact that you left your mom to stay with her, to me, shows that you are NTA. That never happens in movies for a reason, it\u2019s so rare no one would believe it.", "That's hard. I know that feeling exactly.", "Step mom (Mom's wife) is OUT of line here.  IT IS NOT her business what you said in your speech.  \n\nYou have relationships with both your mom and Krystie, and they both helped you.  Krystie was there for you after your fathers death wis important, no matter how you mom or SM feel about it.  \n\nI would consider limiting contact with your om, and gong NC with her wife.  But I don't know if you are in a position to that.\n\nNTA", "Thank you so much.", "Firstly (haha), thank you :) secondly, you\u2019re so right and I agree. I used to doubt myself once I started staying over at Krystie\u2019s thinking it was somehow my fault. Maybe I just needed these helping words from everyone to know that it was my moment, not theirs\u2026", "Yes yes, mom automatically thought because SM was in my life, she would also get mentioned in my speech.", "I don\u2019t know what to say by how overwhelmed with such kindness, thank you."]}
