Like who does that??\n\nTell your girlfriend that her mother\u2019s behavior was unacceptable, and her justifying her mother\u2018s actions by putting the blame on you is also unacceptable. \u201cYou know what she was like, I warned you\u201d are not valid arguments. Her mother looked through sensitive information and tried to get into a safe; that\u2019s not excusable behavior, that\u2019s criminal.\n\nIf your gf doesn\u2019t see her mother\u2019s behavior as wrong, time to dump her, too.

Good luck!", "NTA. Don't be manipulated to go on the defensive. What her mom did is a gross violation of boundaries and a slap in the face to your hospitality. They should be on their hands and knees apologising to you, not accusing you of being unreasonable for expecting privacy in your own house.", "NTA. Being nosy is one thing. Going through your bank documents and trying to get into a safe is on a completely different level. Your girlfriend did not warn you that her mother was going to attempt full blown espionage.

Ask her if there were times her Mum took her stuff or read her diary, letters etc. Then tell her about your childhood.

And trying multiple codes to get into a safe you don't own? Your girlfriend is lucky you didn't call the cops. That sounds like attempted theft to me.", "NTA, and some relationship alarm bells that it was your fault in any way.", "You should not have to lock any parts of your house when somebody visits.... NTA....but are you sure you do not see any issue with gf...she is minimizing moms actions and stating you should have locked your items and parts of your house when she visited....", "NTA, and be careful she hasn't taken down your SS# and other info to use for ID theft.", "You are completely fine in this situation, IMO. Looking through your personal things, regardless of how they are related to you, is not acceptable, and there isn\u2019t really a reasonable justification. I wouldn\u2019t budge on this one, if I were you", "NTA My now ex MIL came to visit.  I caught her going thru a filing cabinet in the office with bank statements, tax returns etc.  She felt perfectly ok about it because \u201cwe\u2019re family.\u201d.  I did not.  I made my ex remove her from our home.", "NTA and the fact that your girlfriend is perfectly okay with this is and the fault lies with you is a huge red flag. Kick them both out.", "NTA, you need to kick the GF out too.", "NTA\n\nYour gf needs therapy to shatter the false image that this is normal healthy behavior", "Nta, now you know why she's never invited to visit places besides her small hometown.", "NTA. Time for the girlfriend to go as well.", "NTA. I do believe that by trying to access the safe, she committed a crime.", "Nta. Kick them out.", "NTA and hold your boundary. She will do everything to manipulate you to think you are wrong", "NTA - What your GF's mother did was totally unacceptable. But you have bigger problem on your hands. Continuing the relationship with your GF. The mom isn't going to change. Can you accept having the mom; visit, be there when your baby is born, have her move in when she loses her job and will be homeless otherwise, etc?", "I'd kick the GF out as well..  It is never okay to snoop... If you consider marriage a prenup would be a good idea", "NTA.  There's a big difference between snooping in someone's medicine cabinet, and trying to break open a safe.  It's a safe. What did she think you would have in there, candy? No. She thought it would be $$ or jewelry or something. Good for you for kicking her out.", "NTA, you should really think about this relationship. She is defending her mother's behavior. Did that not register with you?", "Nta. I'd freeze my credit. She looked at your tax returns and may have saw your social security number on it. She could potentially open up some credit cards and fuck up your score. She might not do it soon. But in the future she totally can.", "Let\u2019s go Bears", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any, your gf is the AH to invite her, KNOWING her mom would do it.", "NTA. What is wrong with your gf? Nosy is one thing, a potential thief is something else. And what else should you conclude if she is attempting to access your laptop and safe? Nosy is looking in your kitchen cabinets or the medicine cabinet. No, this is wholly different and if your gf knew that her mom was this level of intrusive, she should have never invited her. I have to question being in a relationship where someone is attempting to normalize this level of invasive behavior, OP--so should you. If you gf thinks that you're overreacting to this, then where is the line for her?", "Just remembered about this. Which makes me wonder does the girlfriend have financial issues too? Or it could be she\u2019s just an enabler", "I had the exact same thought about the financial angle.", "Not to mention, since his gf is ok with her mother doing this, makes me think that the gf is in on it or will be in the future. What else has the gf done that op should know about? The trust is broken in my opinion. \n\nNTA", "Yeah a little bit nosy is:\n\n* overhears a phone conversation & then comments on it as if she were a part of the phone conversation \n\n* makes uninvited observations about times left out in the home \n\n* asks obtrusive questions\n\nA little bit nosy is not \u201ctries to break into a locked safe while you\u2019re out of the house.\u201d", "You\u2019re right.  This wasn\u2019t nosy.  It was violating.", "Lock the girlfriend out of the office, if not the entire house.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019d hazard a guess that the gf\u2019s mom is more likely to ask for money on a regular basis. She wants to see if she can manipulate her daughter into getting OP to cough up a couple hundred bucks here and there then make it a regular thing.", "Totally - this isn't mere nosiness, and gf defending mom trying to break into OP's safe and laptop is 100% end of relationship material, mom was looking to rob and gf supports her mom in doing so, NTA and time to get out of dodge OP.", "Thank you. What gf\u2019s mom did was burglary.", "Nah. I would never trust that woman in my house again.", "My guess is she would have used that info to influence the daughter and relationship. Or who knows, maybe use the info to try to benefit herself.\n\nI just wrote my snarky reply because I was so angry on his behalf and didn't want to either write a novel or jump to the typical aita \" dump her\" response given I only know a little about the relationship, but there are so many questions. \n\nOne of the \\*\\*many\\*\\* sad things about this situation is that the consequences could possibly have become something that changed the mother's behavior. Instead the gf is making OP out to be the issue. Or maybe nothing would have changed. The snooping was so extreme that she has probably been caught before and she still does it.", "Unless she was writing down the numbers as well I doubt this is necessary. I'm getting more of a nosy snoop vibe than a commit fraud vibe here.", "No. Just no. Households where this has been normalized do not warn their spouses. They assume it is normal and say nothing.\n\nEven if this kind of BS has been normalized in the household, it takes basic exposure to media to realize that this is not normal.", "If she had accessed the safe where his Birth Certificate and SS card are, along with his banking info,  she could have committed identity theft. \nI would have kicked GF out with her mother. What if they are playing a long scam on him? It's happened. \nNTA OP. Protect yourself.", "My crazy aunt used to steal stuff from my grandparents on a regular basis. It got to the point that they were afraid to leave for any length of time because she\u2019d come over and loot stuff out of the house.", "She was trying to open the safe.  That\u2019s more than nosy snooping."]}
