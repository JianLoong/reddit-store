Nosy in-laws (you\u2019re not married but you know what I mean) are a bane in many relationships. She violated your trust, your space, and tried to break into a locked safe. Like who does that??\n\nTell your girlfriend that her mother\u2019s behavior was unacceptable, and her justifying her mother\u2018s actions by putting the blame on you is also unacceptable. \u201cYou know what she was like, I warned you\u201d are not valid arguments. Her mother looked through sensitive information and tried to get into a safe; that\u2019s not excusable behavior, that\u2019s criminal.\n\nIf your gf doesn\u2019t see her mother\u2019s behavior as wrong, time to dump her, too. It\u2019ll only get worse if she can\u2019t acknowledge how bad that is.\n\n\\[edit\\] Adding that since your gf\u2019s mom is in financial trouble and went looking through your financial information\u2026 that\u2019s suspicious as hell. It was already bad enough but I wouldn\u2019t doubt she was also fishing for info to use to manipulate her daughter and you into giving her money.\n\nAs some have pointed out, make sure your financial info is secure. Good luck!", "NTA. Don't be manipulated to go on the defensive. What her mom did is a gross violation of boundaries and a slap in the face to your hospitality. They should be on their hands and knees apologising to you, not accusing you of being unreasonable for expecting privacy in your own house.", "NTA. Being nosy is one thing. Going through your bank documents and trying to get into a safe is on a completely different level. Your girlfriend did not warn you that her mother was going to attempt full blown espionage. And don\u2019t let her tell you that this is your fault - nosy or not, you should not have to worry about any guest going through your financial information. \n\nSo, yes, you were justified in kicking her out.", "OP definitely re-think your gf's attitude and your relationship to simply dismiss her actions and nonchalantly and play the victim in all of this is beyond any kind of common sense or human decency.  To say \"**My girlfriend thought I was over exaggerating it even after showed her the footage.**\" and \"**told me it was my fault because I should have locked off that part of the house if I didn\u2019t want her going thought it was.**\" how can you even trust her anymore and to have your back in supporting you in anything?", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing when your girlfriend said she was nosy you thought she meant asking rather personal questions, not rifling through the contents of your home.  \n\nIt's concerning that your girlfriend thinks this is no big deal.", "NTA. She literally invaded your privacy and tried to open your safe. She very well could have stole from you and you wouldn\u2019t know. Your girlfriend is wrong and her mom sucks", "NTA. Looking thru a filing cabinet or laptop can = Nosy. Trying to open a safe = thief. This isn't a child who needs a kid proofed house. This is a grown adult who violates other's boundaries. You were right in telling her to leave. \n\nFrom what you said it reads like your gf is enabling her mother's behavior. One does not \"thief proof\" a house from adult guests, one does not let them in the house in the first place. \n\nUnfortunately you may need to have further discussion about this with your gf. You will need to decide what boundaries you want to set regarding gf mom (and your gf) going forward.", "NTA, her mother is a grown ass woman who is now suffering the consequences of her actions.", "Nta. You were absolutely justified", "Clear NTA.", "NTA, probably the first time she has found out post fucking around", "NTA\n\nYour gf and her mother are for sure. The fact that she had the seeds to blame you for her mother's unbelievably rude actions..... IMO, that's grounds to be dumping her. Your gf is (at best) an enabler. At worst, she's condoning her mother's behavior and acting as if it was your fault her mother when snooping through your stuff. I couldn't care less if the door was unlocked.... You don't go through someone's personal belongings.", "NTA. Justified. I would understand if you felt violated.", "Nta", "NTA and if the girlfriend doesn't like it, she can leave too", "NTA - This was a big invasion of privacy. I worry about your gf's reaction to this.", "NTA. Nosy is looking in someone's medicine cabinet. NOT trying to break into someone's safe by guessing the code and looking through personal and important documents. \n\nDoes your gf always victim-blame?", "NTA, and how would your girlfriend react if the situation were reversed? You don't snoop through someone's house when you're a guest. It's called respect.", "Gf said mom had financial issues, not that shes known to steal info/valuable items, NTA\n\nYou had video proof of how bad it got so quick. And Gf still is justifying her Moms actions *AND* blaming yiu for not being proactive enough? \n\nIf I invite ANYONE into my home I immediately expect them to Not steal or snoop. Even if they are a classic case clepto. Just because they have no self control doesnt mean you should have to deal. \n\nId take a step back from this and see if this is the life you want. Best of luck Op.", "Her behavior slides right past nosey, and into potential identity theft, and or attempts to steal from your safe.  Maybe she thought she would a pass code to your safe or bank info in your papers.   \n\nNosey was an understatement.  She did more then just peek in your medicine cabinet, or go through old photo albums you had on a shelf.", "NTA - kick out the girlfriend as well", "NTA- but your gf has grown up thinking her mother\u2019s lack of boundaries is normal. And it\u2019s ridiculous that she blames you for it.\n\nStand firm on this.\n\nAnd show her how to stand up to her mother\u2019s behavior. \n\nHer mother is used to doing whatever the hell she wants with your gf. You just let her know she can\u2019t do the same wi to you.\n\nHill to die on, if your gf keeps giving shit.  Then you know what to do.", "NTA just because you were told she was noisy doesn\u2019t excuse the breach of trust.", "NTA\n\nLock all of your credit.", "NTA kick out the gf next", "NTA, and I'd be concerned that your girlfriend's mom might have been planning to commit identity theft.
