Like who does that??\n\nTell your girlfriend that her mother\u2019s behavior was unacceptable, and her justifying her mother\u2018s actions by putting the blame on you is also unacceptable. \u201cYou know what she was like, I warned you\u201d are not valid arguments. Her mother looked through sensitive information and tried to get into a safe; that\u2019s not excusable behavior, that\u2019s criminal.\n\nIf your gf doesn\u2019t see her mother\u2019s behavior as wrong, time to dump her, too.

Good luck!", "NTA. Don't be manipulated to go on the defensive. What her mom did is a gross violation of boundaries and a slap in the face to your hospitality. They should be on their hands and knees apologising to you, not accusing you of being unreasonable for expecting privacy in your own house.", "NTA. Being nosy is one thing. Going through your bank documents and trying to get into a safe is on a completely different level. Your girlfriend did not warn you that her mother was going to attempt full blown espionage. And don\u2019t let her tell you that this is your fault - nosy or not, you should not have to worry about any guest going through your financial information. \n\nSo, yes, you were justified in kicking her out.", "OP definitely re-think your gf's attitude and your relationship to simply dismiss her actions and nonchalantly and play the victim in all of this is beyond any kind of common sense or human decency.

You were right in telling her to leave. \n\nFrom what you said it reads like your gf is enabling her mother's behavior. One does not \"thief proof\" a house from adult guests, one does not let them in the house in the first place. \n\nUnfortunately you may need to have further discussion about this with your gf.

The fact that she had the seeds to blame you for her mother's unbelievably rude actions..... IMO, that's grounds to be dumping her. Your gf is (at best) an enabler.

She hasn't realised everyone else's definition of nosy is someone who will ask a lot of questions, possibly invasive ones. \n\nYou should sit down with your girlfriend and ask her about her childhood. Ask her if there were times her Mum took her stuff or read her diary, letters etc. Then tell her about your childhood. Ask your girlfriend what she thinks would happen if she went through her co-workers phone, bag, payslip? Would her job say that's ok, you're nosy, or would they fire her?
