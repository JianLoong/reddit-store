You're allowed to not be friends with people, even when they're foreigners", "NTA\n\nIf you are uncomfortable and they are newest to the grouping then it makes sense to want to stop now before making it even more uncomfortable. It almost sounds like she was trying to imply she was your husband\u2019s type more than you. I wouldn\u2019t want that kind of person around friend gatherings because what stops her from trying to cause more uncomfortable situations? Claire can go hang out with Lucy if she is that worried. I\u2019m in a foreign country with only my husband and child atm\u2026and yes it\u2019s hard but not so hard you can\u2019t make friends or control yourself after finding out someone is married", "INFO: is there a reason you think she made these comments maliciously? I find it more weird/confusing than anything, but maybe there\u2019s details I don\u2019t know that point to her comments being nasty (eg if he\u2019s conventional attractive and you\u2019re not, or something.)", "NAH\n\nSo Lucy wasn't hitting on your husband or insulting either one of you, but she's really socially awkward? \n\nAnd she has tried to apologize? \n\nJust as you get to control who you invite into your home; your friends get to control who they invite into their homes. Trying to control the group is probably unproductive.\n\nMy two cents, accept the apology, give her another chance in social setting that includes your husband. If she's inappropriate again, the whole group will see she's not fitting in and stop including her.", "Compassion is nice, but you do not need to turn the other cheek. NTA", "I think you're NTA for not wanting to be her friend but YTA for trying to get everyone to be against her. \n\nif you don't want to be her friend, that's fine. but she's done nothing wrong to the rest of the group so why are you expecting them to follow suit? it's a high school mentality to not want your friends to include someone just because of your own feelings towards her when she's literally done nothing wrong.", "NAH - I feel like this could just be an issue of a cultural faux pas, Lucy not realizing that the way she was acting was rude, and it seems like she is trying to apologize now that she realizes. At the same time, you are well within your rights to not want to spend time around someone who makes you uncomfortable. I think it's quite possible that both of you are coming from understandable places here.", "NTA - but me and my partner are very different and we get it a lot purely because they are surprised we are so good together when honestly we probably shouldn't be \ud83d\ude02 but she's perfect for me!\n\nIt's also your home and if something bothers you that's your decision.", "Honestly\u2026this sounds like it might  really be about something else. I am hoping that this is not really about Lucy being a foreigner. The offense seems kind of small to result in Lucy being banned from your home after one meeting, her apologies ignored, and involving the other members of the friend group. Your reaction would be appropriate if she made a pass at your husband. Was this already a sensitive issue for you - i.e., are you worried that people think you aren\u2019t your husband\u2019s type?", "NTA - you invited her into your home, and she got upset that your husband is your husband.\n\nYou also do t have to let women who are clearly attracted to your husband, **and made no secret of her judgement of your partnership,** around to keep the peace.  She was rude about your relationship, and that\u2019s enough to not want to be friends.\n\n**Not all friends of friends are our friends, and just because others like her doesn\u2019t mean she gets an invite to your home.**\n\nAnyone who wants her around is welcome to host her in their homes. But you don\u2019t have you allow her into yours.", "INFO: Did Lucy come from a country that primarily spoke a different language than the one y'all are in?\n\nEither way, NTA, ultimately you're not obligated to hang out with anyone you don't want to, but I am wondering if the intent was miscommunicated due to language barriers or cultural differences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not that she has tried hard to get your husband to cheat on you, not that she has said you're not good enough for your husband. Because you are a surprising pairing....

We both are really respectful of each other and have a similar moral compass which I think is what matters.", "I am almost in agreement with you. I had a friend stop talking to me because of something similar.  My friend and I were at a party talking and a man walked in the room and I said OMG he is fine. She said in a huff that\u2019s my boyfriend and she has not spoken to me since.  We crossed paths from time to time over the years as we have the same friend circle.
