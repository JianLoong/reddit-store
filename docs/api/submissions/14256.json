You're allowed to not be friends with people, even when they're foreigners", "NTA\n\nIf you are uncomfortable and they are newest to the grouping then it makes sense to want to stop now before making it even more uncomfortable. It almost sounds like she was trying to imply she was your husband\u2019s type more than you. I wouldn\u2019t want that kind of person around friend gatherings because what stops her from trying to cause more uncomfortable situations? Claire can go hang out with Lucy if she is that worried.

I find it more weird/confusing than anything, but maybe there\u2019s details I don\u2019t know that point to her comments being nasty (eg if he\u2019s conventional attractive and you\u2019re not, or something.)", "NAH\n\nSo Lucy wasn't hitting on your husband or insulting either one of you, but she's really socially awkward? \n\nAnd she has tried to apologize? \n\nJust as you get to control who you invite into your home; your friends get to control who they invite into their homes. Trying to control the group is probably unproductive.\n\nMy two cents, accept the apology, give her another chance in social setting that includes your husband. If she's inappropriate again, the whole group will see she's not fitting in and stop including her.", "Compassion is nice, but you do not need to turn the other cheek. NTA", "I think you're NTA for not wanting to be her friend but YTA for trying to get everyone to be against her. \n\nif you don't want to be her friend, that's fine. but she's done nothing wrong to the rest of the group so why are you expecting them to follow suit? it's a high school mentality to not want your friends to include someone just because of your own feelings towards her when she's literally done nothing wrong.", "NAH - I feel like this could just be an issue of a cultural faux pas, Lucy not realizing that the way she was acting was rude, and it seems like she is trying to apologize now that she realizes. At the same time, you are well within your rights to not want to spend time around someone who makes you uncomfortable. I think it's quite possible that both of you are coming from understandable places here.", "NTA - but me and my partner are very different and we get it a lot purely because they are surprised we are so good together when honestly we probably shouldn't be \ud83d\ude02 but she's perfect for me!\n\nIt's also your home and if something bothers you that's your decision.", "Honestly\u2026this sounds like it might  really be about something else. I am hoping that this is not really about Lucy being a foreigner. The offense seems kind of small to result in Lucy being banned from your home after one meeting, her apologies ignored, and involving the other members of the friend group. Your reaction would be appropriate if she made a pass at your husband. Was this already a sensitive issue for you - i.e., are you worried that people think you aren\u2019t your husband\u2019s type?", "NTA - you invited her into your home, and she got upset that your husband is your husband.\n\nYou also do t have to let women who are clearly attracted to your husband, **and made no secret of her judgement of your partnership,** around to keep the peace.  She was rude about your relationship, and that\u2019s enough to not want to be friends.\n\n**Not all friends of friends are our friends, and just because others like her doesn\u2019t mean she gets an invite to your home.**\n\nAnyone who wants her around is welcome to host her in their homes. But you don\u2019t have you allow her into yours.", "INFO: Did Lucy come from a country that primarily spoke a different language than the one y'all are in?\n\nEither way, NTA, ultimately you're not obligated to hang out with anyone you don't want to, but I am wondering if the intent was miscommunicated due to language barriers or cultural differences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a friend stop talking to me because of something similar.  My friend and I were at a party talking and a man walked in the room and I said OMG he is fine.

If you're all going out to bowling or dinner or drinks or something, then yes, I can see that needing to be something everyone agrees on. But there is no group decision required when it comes to having someone in your personal property. Eff that. On top of that, she put her whole ass in her mouth when she wouldn't drop it after the first 'X is married to Y?\" Like, okay. Clearly she thought he was single and is surprised because it's obvious she was interested. She reacted to you out of jealousy, but if she'd had a moment to think, she might not have said all that out loud or at all because she's in YOUR home and basically thirsting over your husband and questioning his choices. Right in front of his choice.\n\nMaybe later or at another venue, she can attempt to make up for it. But you are definitely not required to be forced to host her in your home.

It seems to me like OP\u2019s husband was flirting with Lucy and that\u2019s why she was shocked they were married. More the husband\u2019s fault if that\u2019s the case.

Apologizing is her only chance at being reinvited to the op's gatherings.

Trying to control the group is probably unproductive.\n\nFrom what I understand, Lucy is only uninvited from events at the op's home. Claire is the one who decided they needed to follow a democratic system and got everyone else involved. \n\n>My two cents, accept the apology, give her another chance in social setting that includes your husband.\n\nThis is an okay option, but not one she needs to take. It's okay to nip a potential problem in the bud, and no one should ever be shamed into hosting someone who has insulted them.", "I feel like it's probably a stretch, but it's it possible that the something in her tone that rubbed op the wrong/the wording leading to the assumption Lucy was saying op shouldn't be her husband's type way was that Lucy's first language may not be english and she may not know proper intonation or social connotation around some phrasings?\n\nReading it my first thought was that the intention was \"oh, you guys are married? I never would've guessed, you seem like such different people\" in more of a \"you typically see couples that are separately very similar people to each other\" if that makes any sense.

Why hyper focus on such a detail if you don't have an issue with it? \n\nThis would irritate me too and I'm very direct so after the third comment I'd be like \"Yes, we are coupled up, is that a problem for you?\"", "Claire said it was unfair and should be a group discussion. Claire is 100% entitled. How is it a group discussion when only OP and her husband own the house. Only they can dictate who can be there and who cant.", "Agree that it was really odd. But, Lucy has apologized, so it\u2019s unlikely to happen again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s also odd to me that OP\u2019s reaction was so harsh. Why not give her another chance?", "it clearly says in the post that Lucy made comments about how she thought he was single", "Well as with most of reddit, I think cause he has a penis, he must have done something wrong...I mean clearly the husband is at fault.\nI think it's more likely the husband was just friendly and OP wasn't hovering, hanging on him, doing PDA and she prolly was attracted to him.", "Agreed, if Claire wants to host her own regular event for everyone and include Lucy, that's fine. But this is OPs home and there's no obligation to invite her to these events.", ">Agree that it was really odd.\n\nIt's past odd. It's very rude and indicative of a deeper meaning.\n\nIt's like those people who insist you should eat a salad instead of the burger you ordered. \n\nWhy is she so fixated on the fact that these people are married? \n\nOne comment was enough. Making multiple is deserving of whatever backlash you get. \n\n>But, Lucy has apologized, so it\u2019s unlikely to happen again.\n\nI think it matters that this apology seems to have come *after* she was disinvited from group settings in the op's home. She had no choice but to do so if she wanted to continue to build rapport with this group, and that takes away some of its weight. \n\n>Why not give her another chance?\n\nSome people have been through too much shit to be accommodating. It's okay to have firm boundaries, and doubly so if they involve someone disrespecting your relationship.\n\nIf she wanted to turn the other cheek, that's fine, but it's not a requirement. In the instance that Lucy continues to exhibit rude behavior 3 hangouts down the line, it is a lot harder to get rid of her than doing so from the get go.", "It sounds more like she straight up didn't believe husband was with OP.
