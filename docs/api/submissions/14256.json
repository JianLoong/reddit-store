It's very rude and indicative of a deeper meaning.\n\nIt's like those people who insist you should eat a salad instead of the burger you ordered. \n\nWhy is she so fixated on the fact that these people are married? \n\nOne comment was enough. Making multiple is deserving of whatever backlash you get. \n\n>But, Lucy has apologized, so it\u2019s unlikely to happen again.\n\nI think it matters that this apology seems to have come *after* she was disinvited from group settings in the op's home. She had no choice but to do so if she wanted to continue to build rapport with this group, and that takes away some of its weight. \n\n>Why not give her another chance?\n\nSome people have been through too much shit to be accommodating. It's okay to have firm boundaries, and doubly so if they involve someone disrespecting your relationship.\n\nIf she wanted to turn the other cheek, that's fine, but it's not a requirement. In the instance that Lucy continues to exhibit rude behavior 3 hangouts down the line, it is a lot harder to get rid of her than doing so from the get go.", "It sounds more like she straight up didn't believe husband was with OP.

And not every wife and husband wear their ring but that does not mean they are trying to flirt or cheat with others. \nThis could have been a misunderstanding that could have ended here if Lucy did not keep making comments. Its clear that Lucy went over boundaries", "No ring?", "How is that similar to OP\u2019s situation? Lucy was repeatedly commenting on how she didn\u2019t know he was married to OP, and when she wouldn\u2019t drop it OP finally had enough and asked why.", "I can understand being weirded out, but it\u2019s a bit of a leap to say that she thinks OP shouldn\u2019t be married to her husband.", "If someone came up to you and your partner and kept repeating how they thought your partner was single and how they can\u2019t believe you two are married you wouldn\u2019t find that insulting in the slightest? Especially when it\u2019s followed up with, \u201cyou two just seem so different from each other.\u201d", "She is suggesting that OP is too unattractive to be married to her husband.\n\nUnfortunately, these kinds of comments are made often to married/partnered women who are fat by thin, jealous women, who will sometimes try to steal the man to reaffirm their own distorted view that they are more attractive and worthier due to their own genetics.", "Fair enough, I think my brain glossed over that sentence on my first read through \ud83d\ude05", "It seems to insinuate pretty well the Lucy didn\u2019t think they should be together with how surprised she was that she kept having to repeat the fact", "Again, I wasn\u2019t there. Yes it\u2019s not good manners but without the context of the rest of the young woman\u2019s personality, it\u2019s hard to ascertain her mood. Maybe she\u2019s just not very sophisticated or well socialized. Nervous people babble in new situations. In any case, I don\u2019t think she meant any offense. I agree OP shouldn\u2019t have her over to the house if she doesn\u2019t want but I think she\u2019s making a mountain out of a molehill. And she shouldn\u2019t make a decision for the whole group based on this minor nonsense.", "Lol its okay, it happens! \ud83d\ude02", "This deserves more votes", "Yes, but we don\u2019t know exactly what she said, all we know is that she repeated the info and according to OP that she used a bad tone. I\u2019m not trying to invalidate OPs gut feeling, which is why I said NTA, but I\u2019m not going to treat it as a fact because that\u2019s how OP feels.", "Is she really making the decision for the whole group, or does it just seem that way because most of the gatherings are at her own house? If she\u2019s trying to ban Lucy from parties at other people\u2019s houses that\u2019s a different story.", "Men often don't, so women wouldn't rely on that as an indicator.", "Will be honest tho I'd love to see \"Lucy's\" side in all this", "I meant if he was wearing one then she was just being catty, not honest about thinking he was single", "I'd be open to it, but it's a hard sell for me, lol.", "Fair enough."]}
