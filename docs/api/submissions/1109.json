{"id": 1109, "submission_id": "ylp2ze", "title": "WIBTA if I asked my husband not to hang out with his friend?", "selftext": "Hear me out. \nMy (F25) husband (M25) and I have been together for almost four years, married for 1.5. We have a two year old together. For the most part, aside from regular ups and downs of life and relationships, we have a solid marriage. \n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, my husband has been friends with\u2026 let\u2019s call her Summer (F23). It didn\u2019t bother me that she was a woman, and it didn\u2019t even bother me at first that they dated in high school. It was high school, so who cares? \n\nWell, from the beginning of our relationship, Summer has been a point of contention. They used to Snapchat a lot, and she used to get really annoyed when he would talk about me. He and I agreed to both delete Snapchat, especially after the night he asked her to help reassure me that they were just friends and she responded with, \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d That was about 4 months into our relationship. She has talked about my shortcomings, he turns to her with our relationship problems, she\u2019s reassured him that he deserves better. When I pointed it out originally, with a bullet-pointed list of how she\u2019d demonstrated she felt more for him and she had disrespected our relationship, he went low contact for nine months. \n\nLo and behold, she and her boyfriend broke up and she NEEDED my husband\u2019s friendship. Fine. I\u2019m not going to be the kind of woman who tells him who he cannot be friends with (though I will let the record show he has asked me to block a friend before because that friend had had a crush on me two years prior and he felt that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for me to have him around as a friend after that). So they\u2019re friends. \n\nShe was around a lot after her breakup. I was very pregnant at that point, so she kept her behavior in check and it would only be little comments or little things I got bothered by. She got weird about my child for a while, talking about how our relationship was too unstable and she was afraid that if he and I broke up she would \u201close a baby\u201d. I told him that I didn\u2019t want her around anymore. But that went unheard when she bought our baby a bunch of stuff and tried to be very friendly with me before and after the birth. She found a new dude not too long after that, so I thought her weirdness had passed. \n\nThen she moved nearby and instead of asking her new boyfriend for help moving, putting things together in her apartment, or running errands, she would ask my husband. I told him it was annoying. He asked me to be kind and considerate, as she got into a pretty serious car accident right before she moved. I let it go. He actually tried really hard for us to be friends, but she and I just don\u2019t get along. We moved, and it seemed the weirdness I had been feeling and the closeness in their friendship gained some separation. \n\nShe popped back up this week. It\u2019s almost my kid\u2019s second birthday. She doesn\u2019t talk to me very much and I don\u2019t care, because I don\u2019t have much in common with her. I guess she asked my husband for his help with moving some of her stuff and finding a storage unit. She mentioned that her boyfriend can\u2019t help because he is \u201cso rarely around\u201d. It\u2019s been a while since she\u2019s said or done anything inappropriate and my husband says that he\u2019s just being a good pal. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I asked him not to go help Summer?", "created_utc": 1667537074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylp2ze/wibta_if_i_asked_my_husband_not_to_hang_out_with/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
