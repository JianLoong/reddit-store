You can't be lovely people while also often making critical and offensive comments about things that matter as little as the car needing washed and your hair color. That's shitty, overbearing, and infantilizing, especially if you've told them it's not appreciated.  \n\n\n>asked to stay with us in our small 2BR apartment\n\nThey know exactly how small your home is and still would rather impose on your space for FOUR MONTHS than stay in their own vacant home? No, screw that. You and your husband should be able to come home to your own space at the end of the day and enjoy some peace and quiet and not have an additional two grown adults hanging around your space that you have to coordinate and compromise with over everything for FOUR MONTHS.   \n\n\n>I told my husband this many times but he swore it would be fine \n\nYour husband knows about your childhood trauma, PTSD, and anxiety attack and told you that you are \"overreacting\" and that it \"will be fine.\" He's either not listening to you, or he doesn't get it, or he doesn't care.  \n\n\n>my therapist recommended I go to the hospital, but my husband instead just told his parents they need to leave and go to their house because it is making me uncomfortable.\n\nYour THERAPIST, a professional in their field, told you that you needed to go to the hospital to be seen because of your medical condition, and your husband, instead of taking you to the hospital, told his parents that they are \"making you uncomfortable\" and need to leave. He's majorly downplaying your medical condition (or really doesn't get it) and making you look like you're just picky about having your space instead of having a major anxiety attack.  \n\n\n>Now they all \u2014 including my husband \u2014 are upset with me\n\nThey are upset because you have a medical condition. Let that sink in for a minute.", "NTA. Everyone is ignoring and invalidating your very VALID reasons and medical condition. Why doesn't hubby have any empathy for you?", "NTA, it always kind of fascinates me that relationships like this are out there. You have been married for 5 years, presumably together longer, had a kid together, etc. all the while there is a major, major red flag and issue in your relationship likely to be there for decades that you just kind of trucked through. Your in laws have no boundaries and your husband is spineless when it comes to them, I know it's cliche here but this is major enough you should probably do couple's therapy.", "NTA. \n\nTell your husband, you married him and not his family. The house is too tiny to host people for more than a weekend. It isn\u2019t fair to you because they are not your family. Ask your husband if it was  the other way around and you had your parents around that long.", "NTA. Your house, your rules and they have a whole ass home they could stay in? Absolutely not. Also, your husband is an asshole for not standing up for you. They all clearly have codependency issues.", "What a bunch of selfish jerks!  I'm horrified by the fact that your over enabling husband put them before you.   None of this is okay. \n\nNTA", "Hard NTA.  \n\nYour husband should be prioritizing the health of his wife and children, especially a wife postpartum and having panic attacks.  In-laws expecting to squeeze into your small, fully occupied home for FOUR MONTHS is the real A move.", "NTA\n\nthey wanted to stay with you for 4 months...kicking the kids out of their room.... when they had their own place near by?\n\nThat is insane to ask!\n\nTheir whole family dynamic makes me feel my anxiety rise. They are overbearing and rude, have no respect for personal boundaries and expect people to accommodate them while they accommodate no one!", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry to tell you, your in laws are not lovely people, and you do not have a fairly solid relationship with your your husband.\n\nThere probably isn\u2019t much you can do about your in laws themselves, but there IS plenty your husband can do. His invalidation of your feelings and telling you to grow a thicker skin is not the behavior you deserve from a partner.\n\nI know Reddit jumps to \u201cdivorce him\u201d etc, but you really do need to have a conversation with him one on one how this is all affecting you. If he doesn\u2019t want to listen, then maybe couples therapy etc. There really isn\u2019t a way things will improve here until your husband listens and works to improve the situation.\n\nEveryone else here is an AH, but your husband is the biggest, and needs to get his shit together and start putting his family first, that is, you and the kids. The family he has made a lifelong commitment to and chose, not the family he happened to be raised in, who don\u2019t seem to have any respect for you.", "Your husband is not being understanding  towards you.

You are NTA.", "NTA- your husband is enabling his parents. Just because he has a \"thicker skin\" from dealing with them all his life doesn't mean you (or your children) should have to be subjected to their constant criticism and overbearing behaviour. He is failing you as a husband and father by not standing up to his parents and enforcing proper boundaries. It shouldn't have even been considered that they come and stay with you in the first place if they already have an available place to stay.\n\nAlso they're not \"lovely\" people. Lovely people don't constantly criticize others or make offensive comments", "NTA.  Putting aside the panic attacks, why would your in-laws or you husband think 4 adults and 2 small children living in a small 2BR apartment for 4 months would be a good idea when other alternatives were readily available?  Maybe for a short time in an emergency or if there were financial issues but that does not seem to be the case here.  It sounds like his family has real boundary issues.  As does your husband, if he agrees with them.", "NTA but honey, if your husband is putting up with this behavior and sees no issue in it, then he is also a part of the problem. They're never going to respect you or your boundaries if your husband doesn't back you up. It sounds like he doesn't even really consult you about inviting them to go out with you two. \n\nI'd recommend marriage counseling.", "Um...\n\n>His parents are lovely people, despite their often critical and offensive comments. \n\nThose two statements don't go together.", "NTA. You expressed your concerns and your mental health needs to your husband, and he dismissed them. It's not fair for you to have to suffer through panic attacks and anxiety in your own home because of his family's decision to stay with you. It's understandable that they may be upset about having to move, but it's not your fault that your mental health was affected by the situation. Your husband needs to understand that your mental health and well-being should always come first, and he should have respected your boundaries and concerns from the beginning.", "NTA. Your husband tolerated their rude behavior as a child because he had no choice.  He has a choice now but has been conditioned to accept this behavior, so it all seems normal to him.  You do not need to learn to accept it, but he is going to need some therapy so that he can set appropriate boundaries.  It's tough for people to come to grips that their family, who they love, have behavior that is not acceptable. \n\nFrankly, even if they were the sweetest people on earth, having them for a weekend in a 2-bedroom apartment would be a bit much.  Four months?  Heck no!", "EDIT:  following a response from OP, my verdict is now a very firm and clear NTA.  Original answer text is below but I wanted to clarify where I\u2019m at.\n\n\u2014-\n\nA soft NTA, would need more information to fully commit to this response.\n\nMy NTA is based on the fact that A: 4 months living with the in-laws at your place, even if your relationship is great, is a LOT by almost anybody\u2019s standards, and B: your husband\u2019s priority should be your own comfort and mental health - you\u2019re his life partner and you have at least as much of a say as he does in who stays at your property, so he should respect your wishes on that front.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m not more committed to this response is I don\u2019t know what discussions you had prior to making major life decisions like moving in together, getting married and having children.  Did your husband make it clear from a very early stage in your relationship that his parents would be extremely closely involved in both of your lives and that if you\u2019re not ok with that, it\u2019s a potential deal-breaker?  Did you have a reasonable opportunity to break off the relationship before it got to this stage, in the knowledge that his parents would be such a prominent feature in your married life?\n\nIf all of this WAS made abundantly clear and you went ahead with these major commitments anyway, and you\u2019re only now deciding that it\u2019s a problem, then I\u2019d be inclined to change my verdict.  Otherwise, I\u2019m entirely on your side and feel that your husband should be much firmer with his parents and much more supportive towards yourself.", "NTA,\nFour adults and kids (inc a baby) in a 2 bedroom seriously, that\u2019s crazy and staying for 4 months. \n\nWorst part about having people stay is that they\u2019re \u2018guests\u2019 no matter what relative they are. You have to entertain them, think of the food, get the washing done. \n\nYour partner should be looking after you not his parents interest, they can look after themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
