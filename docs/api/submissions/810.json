My best friend (27f) since kindy is my only bridesmaid. This led to questions from my sister (25f) because she feels like she should be the bridesmaid (if I'm only having one) or a bridesmaid (if I was willing to have more than one). She was hurt. I didn't think it would be such a big surprise because we are not very close. But she thought her attempts would be enough.\n\nSome BG to explain our relationship: We have the same parents. Our dad bailed while mom was pregnant with her. We were raised by mom as a single parent and just like many other kids experience, we were raised by the same woman but had different moms at the same time. Mom adored my sister. She was a mini version of her. She was verbally tough on me. She did not like me. She saw me as a version of my dad. My relationship with my mom reached the point of no return when I was 14. She had apparently expected me to walk my sister home from school but didn't communicate it with me well (nothing unusual for her at all since she hated talking to me). So mom gets home and my sister isn't home yet. She went off on me. She accused me of wanting my sister dead and being a piece of shit like my dad. She told me I was not worth the money she needed to spend to keep me alive and that her life would have been easier with just my sister. I asked her why she didn't abort me and she told me she regretted her decision not to every day, and if she had just kept the appointment she'd be so much happier. That was the point of no return and when I went couch surfing at 16 she said nothing.\n\nMy sister loves our mom. Is fully aware of what happened between mom and me, but is always trying to reconcile us. When I asked her to stop talking about mom she kept it up. Always dropping updates on her in conversation. I told her we would be done if she kept it up and that I did not want to hear about the woman who wished she'd aborted me. She stopped bringing her up as much but it took a while for her to completely stop and it's still new. \n\nIt does make it hard for me to be as close as she wants us to be. Knowing she is still hoping for mom and me in the same room. Knowing she thinks mom is great even after she treated me the way she did. \n\nI do not trust her to be my bridesmaid. I do not trust that she wouldn't spill details of my wedding to mom. Or that she wouldn't try to get her into the wedding if she had more of a role. I also don't trust that she wouldn't talk about mom in a bridesmaid toast at my wedding. I told her this. I told her it was why I didn't ask her. She was so annoyed with me. She told me I should give her a chance to prove herself and that I shouldn't expect her to just forget about mom. I told her she can have any relationship she wants with her mom but I do not want to hear about her. She told me I was worse than mom because I know how it feels to be mistreated for stuff you didn't do.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667329596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjhxc3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_could_never_trust/", "score": 1063, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That needs to be someone who is willing to stand up for you and support you.  You've said nothing that makes me think your sister is yet capable of that.", "Not the AH. Egads! That was a rough past. Sorry you went through it. But\u2026 yeah\u2026 I believe you\u2019re right about your sister. The fact that she tried to shame & insult you into \u201cproving herself\u201d tells you that you were right about her. You gave her enough time to \u201cprove herself\u201d & it took a long time for her to stop talking about your mom. She\u2019s not trust worthy; maybe after 5yrs of her not mentioning your mom.", "NTA\n\nWhat \u201cstuff she didn\u2019t do\u201d is she talking about? Her mother did all those things. Her mother is making zero effort. It\u2019s not your job to parent her mother or be the bigger person or empathize with her struggles. The issue her mother had with your dad should\u2019ve never been put on you or your business. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t invite my sister to the wedding. She\u2019s clearly ok with you being mistreated as well as mistreating you also. You asked her to do one thing and she barely does it. You tell her why she can\u2019t be trusted as a bridesmaid and she admits she\u2019d do all the things you were concerned about. The mom and sister seem rather happy to have each other, let them spend that day together and you enjoy your wedding with no drama. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d find a way to mention or bring up her mother. It\u2019s not worth ruining your day having her there.", "NTA! I said cut ties with both of them it\u2019s not worth the heartache go have a wonderful wedding with your best friend and fianc\u00e9.", "NTA - also just a word of advice about the wedding if you invite your sister make sure others know that your mom is absolutely not welcome at your wedding and to watch out for her because sister may try to get your mom into the wedding even as just a guest", "NTA\n\n*She told me I should give her a chance to prove herself and that I shouldn't expect her to just forget about mom.* \n\nSo you should *trust* her to respect her boundary but also you shouldn't *expect* her to respect your boundary.  LOL She has no intention of respecting your boundary.\n\nAnd this is the thing about loving two people who can't stand each other. You might not want to choose.  But at some point, that it is a choice.  It is saying I love you, but I don't care how much this person hurt you. She doesn't HAVE to cut your mom off because you very justifiably did.  But you don't HAVE to be okay with the fact that she loves someone who treated you like that.  And you DEFINITELY don't have to be okay with her trying to make you get over it and socialize with your mother.", "Nta.\n\nGo no contact.", "NTA and I'd uninvite her from the wedding completely and go LC if she isn't someone you trust to begin with. You are completely justified and reasonable in what you want here, don't let anyone fool you.", "NTA. \n\nYou HAVE given her multiple chances. She's earned your distrust and that isn't because of your mother, it's because of the choices your sister made. \n\nI agree that if you can, NC is a solid option. More chances isn't.", "NTA. Can you not uninvite your mom and sister from your wedding if there is so much tension ?", "NTA for all the reasons that have been said and the way you're telling it, you didn't lash out at her or anything. Not just NTA but well done actually!\n\nThis subreddit has some messed up family dynamics but this one is sooo complex. Your sister does not seem like a bad person in any way. \nI'm trying to see this from her perspective. Her mom showered her with love all her life and before you moved out, she wasn't old enough to properly reflect on the situation and realize what that woman was actually doing to you. After that, you moved out and probably never were in one room with her again so how would your sister now get to the realization that this person who has been nothing but a loving and caring mother in her eyes is capable of treating her own child the way you described - aka is a genuinely bad person. Bad people can show good behavior the same way good people can show bad behavior. \nThe fact that she is not scared by her mother's behavior towards you shows that she's not really understood anything yet. Maybe that'll change, but until then I doubt she'll give up hope to reconcile your relationship with that horrible thing that calls herself a person.", "NTA and I'd tell her that is has taken years for her to respect your decision about cutting off her mum and that while you appreciate it is difficult for her, she knows how horrible this woman was to you.\n\nThat her stance over the years has strained your relationship and that your best friend has always been there for you, even when she wasn't.", "NTA", "OP, you made the right choice and I hope you THRIVE! As for your mother, I don't think Reddit will allow me to write what she deserves.", "NTA. Boundaries are attempts on making a relationship work, not mistreating. You are sparing you both pain. She would feel constricted, even if she was able to keep the secrets. And if she wants to prove herself, there were lots of lower stakes occasions for her to try. A wedding is stressful in itself and not the time for trying unproved abilities.", "NTA\n\nGo low contact since she just can't seem grasp the reality that you and your mom will never love each other.", "NTA. It's your wedding, pick whoever you want for bridesmaids.", "NTA\n\nbtw, isnt what your mom did to you is pretty much child abuse?", "Sorry but YTA - i completely understand you don't want her as bridesmaid, but giving her that explenation is fucked up. As she says, you accused her of something she might be doing, for which you have no proof. Giving you an update about your mother is not at the same level as trying to screw up someones wedding...which is what you accuse her off.\n\nWhy not stick to \" i just want 1 bridesmaid and chosen the person that is nearest to me\"", "Many of those who go NC with parents lose siblings as well, as is clear by the conditions OP described.", "To my mind she is getting her chance right now.\n\nShe is actively in the middle of her chance. And throwing this little tantrum about the being told \"no\" is not helping her chances at all.", "Sister was not responsible for their mother growing up, but as an adult she really needs to accept what happened. Nothing I read suggested that OP blames sister for their mother's behaviour or avoided having a relationship with sister because of it. This all falls on sister and she has nobody to blame but herself now if OP goes NC.", "100%. I agree with going NC or LC at the least with the sister, too. She\u2019s already shown that she can\u2019t be trusted.", "Right? It definitely sounds like sis is just like mom. These two deserve each other. You deserve far better. \n\nNTA- Put these two behind you. I wouldn\u2019t involve your sister in the wedding- I wouldn\u2019t even invite her as I have a feeling she\u2019ll being mommy dearest to the wedding.\n\nHave your wedding build your future and leave these miserable burdens in the past.", "THIS. Sis is living in fantasy land. The sooner she realizes that you and your mom will never be the happy family she wants, the better. But since she doesn't seem to be getting it, I'd agree with NC if it'll help you keep sane. NTA", "She said her sister has been working very hard to follow OPs requirement. I understand OP not making her a bridesmaid, but y'all are way out of line jumping to telling OP to go no contact", "Agreed mommy dearest years to step up and instead took her distractions out on a child. If your sis is invited trust mommy dear rest will see the invite", "Is hard to give up the last little bit of bearable family but I agree completely with this.  I have a golden child sister who was actually fairly decent to me and agreed with the atrocities perpetrated against me from my parents but I'm the end, she never stood up to them on my behalf, when, if switched, I would have orchestrated riots and strikes for her...\n\nGo NC op, eff that noise!", "I think the \"her\" in that sentence is the sister not the mom", "I hate the \u201cbbbbbbut family!\u201d excuse because 90% of the time it\u2019s being used to try and justify someone\u2019s shitty behavior.

I am trying to give her a chance. But the truth is I do not trust her because I know how resistant she has been to stop bringing up mom and stop trying to reconcile us. Any trust is very, very fragile.", "Updates about the mother she knows has verbally said awful shit to me. And not just updates but attempts to try and reconcile us. I don't trust that she wouldn't try to bring her in on my wedding in some way.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Family need to play by the same rules as anyone else we choose to let into our lives.

Based on her last comment, she would be on my no contact list. \n\nShe needs to be uninvited from the wedding.  Flat out tell her no invitation if one wrong word comes out of her mouth.\n\nIf you decide to allow her to attend your wedding, have friends ready to bounce your mother out IF she shows up or remove your sister the minute she opens her mouth about mother.", "Well, there's a question there.  If you don't trust her, is it really safe to have her at the wedding at all?  Will her presence be just too toxic?\n\nI think if you uninvite her from the wedding at this point that might be the right thing for your own anxiety and boundaries, but it will be hard for your relationship with her to recover from that.\n\nOTOH if you're still okay having her then you probably do need to say something, because she's not getting the message that this is not fucking easy for you.  You need credit for trusting her this much, not resentment just for having boundaries.", "You are NTA.\nYou don\u2019t have to have a relationship with your sister, you know.\nYou don\u2019t have to invite her to the wedding.\n\nI am really sorry about what you went through and I\u2019m really sorry your sister is being so horrible about it.", "Your mom abandoned you just like how your dad abandoned all three of you.

It might be very honest to give her that as a reason, but when you did that there were only 2 possible outcomes of the conversation.. either she would fight you on it OR she had to say you are right, i'm not to be trusted...So that is why YTA, you created the conflict and have to live with it", "This is a bot account that is reposting half of a comment someone else made in the thread, \n\nReport - spam - harmful bots.", "Stolen comment bot, original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjhxc3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_could_never_trust/iunvpqg/", "What's wrong with you?
