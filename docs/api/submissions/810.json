My best friend (27f) since kindy is my only bridesmaid. This led to questions from my sister (25f) because she feels like she should be the bridesmaid (if I'm only having one) or a bridesmaid (if I was willing to have more than one). She was hurt. I didn't think it would be such a big surprise because we are not very close. But she thought her attempts would be enough.\n\nSome BG to explain our relationship: We have the same parents. Our dad bailed while mom was pregnant with her. We were raised by mom as a single parent and just like many other kids experience, we were raised by the same woman but had different moms at the same time. Mom adored my sister. She was a mini version of her. She was verbally tough on me. She did not like me. She saw me as a version of my dad. My relationship with my mom reached the point of no return when I was 14. She had apparently expected me to walk my sister home from school but didn't communicate it with me well (nothing unusual for her at all since she hated talking to me). So mom gets home and my sister isn't home yet. She went off on me. She accused me of wanting my sister dead and being a piece of shit like my dad. She told me I was not worth the money she needed to spend to keep me alive and that her life would have been easier with just my sister. I asked her why she didn't abort me and she told me she regretted her decision not to every day, and if she had just kept the appointment she'd be so much happier. That was the point of no return and when I went couch surfing at 16 she said nothing.\n\nMy sister loves our mom. Is fully aware of what happened between mom and me, but is always trying to reconcile us. When I asked her to stop talking about mom she kept it up. Always dropping updates on her in conversation. I told her we would be done if she kept it up and that I did not want to hear about the woman who wished she'd aborted me. She stopped bringing her up as much but it took a while for her to completely stop and it's still new. \n\nIt does make it hard for me to be as close as she wants us to be. Knowing she is still hoping for mom and me in the same room. Knowing she thinks mom is great even after she treated me the way she did. \n\nI do not trust her to be my bridesmaid. I do not trust that she wouldn't spill details of my wedding to mom. Or that she wouldn't try to get her into the wedding if she had more of a role. I also don't trust that she wouldn't talk about mom in a bridesmaid toast at my wedding. I told her this. I told her it was why I didn't ask her. She was so annoyed with me. She told me I should give her a chance to prove herself and that I shouldn't expect her to just forget about mom. I told her she can have any relationship she wants with her mom but I do not want to hear about her. She told me I was worse than mom because I know how it feels to be mistreated for stuff you didn't do.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667329596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjhxc3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_could_never_trust/", "score": 2838, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The wedding is to celebrate OP\u2019s relationship with her partner, not to be a bridge to anything. The fact that sister reacted this way, clearly displaying that she doesn\u2019t really see OP\u2019s perspective, is a clear warning sign that she shouldn\u2019t be trusted with this; especially against the background of her previous behavior.", "What is to stop her from just bringing mom as a +1 as just a regular guest?  I am not sure why the sister is even invited in the first place as it seems like nothing good will come from it.", "If OP's wedding allows plus +s, sis will probably bring the mum as hers.\n\nEdit: added 2 words.\n\nEdit 2: Read another commenter just now, saying the same thing. OP, prepare for your mum coming to your wedding, invited or not.\n\nEdit 3: Or just go LC/NC with her as suggested by other commenters. Your sister is intent on playing \"happy families\" and will do whatever and everything that she can to make that happen, regardless of how you feel about it.", "Except that the sister told OP that she's worse than the mother who wishes she'd aborted OP. So... yeah. I don't think they're out of line at all, especially since the sister has repeatedly ignored OP's requests of 'please don't talk about her to me' (and treats it as a request to 'forget' about their mother), and keeps trying to get them together. Do you really think she wouldn't even consider doing exactly that at OP's wedding?", "NTA. Go NC with your sister at least until after the wedding. Do not invite her to the wedding. You don\u2019t trust her. If she is there you will end up  worried about what she may do or say on your wedding day. It\u2019s not worth it. Enjoy the day without the drama.", "You gave your sister a chance now and she blew it. \n\nI think if she really wanted your trust and be closer to you, she would have accepted your decision and backed off. She tried to make it seem like your getting married is the only way to prove herself - bs. \n\nIt\u2019ll take baby steps over the course of time to earn back your trust and she should understand that if it\u2019s actually important to her.\n\nPersonally, I know people who are very triggered by any information about them getting back to abusive family members. I don\u2019t know how it feels for you but I was told that it made them feel extremely uncomfortable regardless of the type of information - they just don\u2019t want any part of their lives touched in any way by their abusers.\n\nNTA.", "I would add to sister that if mom shows up she **will** be removed, along with whoever brought her.", "Have a picture of your mom handed to security, with EXPRESS instructions that she in not to come in.\nTalk to your wedding planner and vendors just in case.\nBetter safe than sorry", "Totally agree with this \ud83d\udc46", "I like that you say this as though everyone has a wedding planner hahah", "Hahaha sorry, just covering my bases, I meant it more as options.\nWe didn't have a planner but the venue did have security.", "OP, that your sister doesn't hold your mother responsible or accountable for the malicious, hateful, abusive upbringing she subjected you to is reason enough to cut her out. She doesn't see your mother as a villain. She'll never be on your side. \n\nThink about that.", "NTA- your sister has validated your mother's abuse by not calling her out on it. She's okay with how your mom treated you. It's toxic in its own way. Go NC with her.", "Nta.

Have security to remove her or just straight up not invite your sister or give her the wrong date", "Your sister is pushing boundaries by constantly trying to reconcile you and your mom.

Because I have a feeling that your mother WILL show up, be it as your sister's +1, or that your sister/mom has contacted someone in the family with some sob story.\n\nIf you have people you trust, tell them to keep an eye out for your egg donor (because she isn't worthy being called mom). Have her booted out the second she appears and if anyone is assisting her by bringing her as their +1, yeet them out as well.\n\n> She told me I was worse than mom because I know how it feels to be mistreated for stuff you didn't do.\n\nYet she DID do that. She did keep telling about your egg donor, keep bringing her up in conversations when you repeatedly told her to stop. Yes, she needs a chance to prove herself, and she should do that by accepting that she overstepped massively in the past and that she needs to regain your trust.\n\nI'd also point out to her that, if she were to bring your egg donor, or to inform her of your wedding, that's it. She'll lose any contact with you from that point on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, congrats on your wedding!", "Nta. You are not mistreating anyone.", "NTA, uhm bridesmaid isn't the position where you give a person the chance to prove themselves, it's a position you give to someone who has already, relentlessly, proved themselves. Your sister has it completely backward", "She said you're an AH for knowing what it's like to be mistreated for something you didn't do? You're \"mistreating\" your mother because she wants you to not exist. Your so called \"mother\" (egg donor) literally didn't care when you were 16 and COUCH SURFING.\nNTA.\nNC time", "INFO why does she want to be a bridesmaid?", "NTA. Sorry you've had to go through all of this. Your wedding day should be a day for you to celebrate with those you love AND those who love you.

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA\nher saying you\u2019re worse than your mom- wtf\ud83d\ude28 what is happening to her was brought upon her by her own actions?? how is that stuff she didn\u2019t do? you set a boundary that she constantly disregarded would obviously lead to not trusting her to respect it on an important date. furthermore, this is YOUR wedding, YOUR day. you get to decide who you want in your wedding and who you don\u2019t want because this is a day for you/your s/o to share with loved ones", "That's harsh. It's one things to be told you were an accident or something... But to straight up say \"I wish I went through with aborting you\"\n\nWTF IS WRONG WITH HER?\n\nYOU ARE AT NO FAULT DEAR SWEET BABY\n\nHave your wedding, live your best life, and cut off all contact with sis, cuz she don't just LOOK like a mini-mama. She acts like a mini-mama. And I'm scared for the day she blurts out \"I wish mom DID abort you\" in an argument. Cuz that sounds like something that was thrown at you CONSTANTLY and that's not ok! But she might see it as ok.\n\nTHAT IS NOT OK! THAT IS NOT OK! THAT IS NOT OK!\n\nAND YOU ARE DEF NOT THE AH!", "Jeez, I don't even know her, but I wouldn't trust her one bit not to have your mom show up at the wedding or other bridal events.  NTA", "Ask your sister does she really think it's ok for a mother to tell her child that not only did she wish she aborted them but that they actually were going to. Why don't you break down the mistreatment bit by bit saying does she really think it's ok for a mother to do/tell this to their child and if she says no to any of them say then why do you act like it's ok for our mother to do it. Also point out that your relationship went past the point of no return when you were a teenager. That reconciliation is not happening. That she can have a relationship with your mother but you're to be kept out of it. And ask if she could please explain how boundaries are mistreatment", "Probably because the same woman raised you, both of you have no emphaty. So you are right for not trusting her but it is very important that you are aware that you have the same problem. I really hope your marriage will be a happy one and you'll solve this in time.", "NTA. And truthfully, if she keeps it up, you'd be well within your rights that if she has that big of an issue, she doesn't have to attend at all. Up to her. Be there as a guest just HER ALONE no momster or not be there at all. And tbh I'd make sure there's some security measures in place on your venue so you can prevent her from bringing momster along with her as a guest.\n\nShe KNOWS how her mother has treated you and instead of saying something she keeps her tune of \"oh but mommy is fantastic!\". I wouldn't put it past her to bring her to the wedding and momster would just come along because she hates you so she'd be going to make hateful remarks. Also I'd ask a family member or friend either yours or of your future husband, someone you trust since your MOH will be busy helping you and being by your side as a good friend does. I'd condition someone trusted to keep a close eye on sister so she won't try to make any speeches or any shenanigans like \"mommy came!\" or \"mommy wanted you to know something so she wrote a letter!\". She's so immature and devoted to momster that I wouldn't put it past her", "NTA. You can give her a chance, but after your wedding.

Password the cake, the flowers, the venue, everything.

She knows how you feel about your mom, and (in my opinion) rubs her relationship in your face. There is no reason for her to bring up the woman who hurt you.", ">She told me I was worse than mom because I know how it feels to be mistreated for stuff you didn't do\n\nI wouldn't talk to her further, frankly.

What *does* she want to prove, exactly? That she\u2019s right and everyone should all just get along? And who exactly is being \u201cmistreated for stuff [they] didn\u2019t do\u201d anyway? Mom is cut off for stuff she did do. Sis is being kept at arm\u2019s length because of stuff she did do again and again. What in the victim complex??", "Agree! Do you even like having her around? I used to think that I liked seeing my enabler/narc mother before I went NC with my parents. Turns out I'd be a ball of anxiety whenever she was visiting and I was short with everyone depending on her actions", "I get that some kids are closer to a parent than their siblings, but if my sibling told me that our mother had told them multiple times they'd wished they'd aborted them/said other shitty things to them, that would definitely make me see the parent in a different light.", "Damn , op said she still wants a relationship with her sister", "Especially since they are basically saying yeah I know this person abused you/made your life hell/ only causes drama but suck it up for us. And the bbbbbuuuut faaaamily card never goes to the person  who causes the issues", "I can empathize.  My brother is always trying to reconcile our parents, who divorced for a reason.  Our mother is a narcissist, but he truly doesn't see it.  He has this fictionalized version in his head about who she is, and ignores/dismisses anything that contradicts that version.  He truly, delusionally, believes that if my parents could just sit down and have a conversation they would get along.  But that won't happen.  They've never gotten along (not in the 38 years I've known them) and he can't see it.  Because he wants that fantasy so bad, he can't see the reality in front of them. (plus other people have that great relationship, why can't they?  After all, HE gets along with her great so why can't others?  SMH)  It sounds like your sister is the same.  She thinks she just needs to break through to you and suddenly you will be the dutiful daughter and your mother will love you.  But that's not reality.  \n\nI've learned to accept my brother will never see our mother for who she truly is, and to just nod along to the updates he give me on her but otherwise stay disengaged.  It's annoying AF, but it's worth it to have a relationship with him.  You have to decide if it's worth it to have a relationship with your sister."]}
