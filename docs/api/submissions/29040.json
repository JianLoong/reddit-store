Unless she offered to buy you a brand new bottle then she got exactly what she deserved IMO. \n\nActions have consequences.", "Nta- I use korean sunscreen. If it's the same size as mine, one MAAAYBE two full body applications will wipe out the bottle and that's if it's full. You gave her solutions, she played stupid games and won a stupid (avoidable) prize", "NTA, were you supposed to extort her to make sure she would replace the expensive tiny sunscreen? Did the zoo sell it? I know it would be silly to ask your dad but the whole problem could have been solved by putting on the shirt or buying regular sunscreen.", "NTA", "NTA, lesson learned for her, I hope. You gave her multiple outs. I bet they sold Sunscreen or an umbrella somewhere at the zoo besides what you offered.", "NTA you what the zoo gift shops sell? Sunscreen!", "NTA. You warned her. Her lack of planning is not your problem!", "Nta you know who sold sun screen, I bet?  The zoo gift store.", "Also by the time she was already aware she was getting burned, it was too late anyway.", "NTA \nEven fancy Korean sunscreen cannot reverse a sunburn once it\u2019s already started.", "You offered several times. You even had a shirt she could wear when she was burning. She didn't put it on so that's her problem.", "NTA \nI bet the gift shop in the zoo had sunscreen. She could have easily bought some.", "NTA\n\nSince you offered to bring body sunscreen and she declined, and also she\u2019s an adult. Most gift shops sell sunscreen, or sometimes umbrellas which would also work. \n\nIt would be different if she brought sunscreen then lost it.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult. She\u2019s responsible for herself.", "Zoos sell sunscreen in the gift shop, no?", "INFO\n\nDid she ask about sunscreen in the gift shop?  All the zoos I\u2019ve worked at or visited sell it.\n\nNTA.  She is more than old enough to make the sensible choice to cut her trip short and either find a way home or stay inside somewhere or accept your loan of long sleeves if she didn\u2019t want to continue frying.", "NTA. You still wouldn't be the AH even if you hadn't offered her all those alternatives.", "\"Lack of planning on your part, does not constitute an emergency on my part.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA  reminds me of my children in elementary school when I would tell them to bring a sweater because the restaurant might be cold.  They always refused, and then got cold.  At 4th grade level, I refused to give them my sweater and they just had to feel cold.  That stopped it.   Idk if your situation with your sister is the same, but her overly dramatic reaction seemed the same.", "NTA she learned an important lesson that day.\nI would have offered her use of it for the price of a new tube", "NTA. Clear case of \"play stupid games, win stupid prices\".", "NTA. You tried to help her and she refused.", "NTA. I always carry both with me just in case because I am Japanese, Irish, and goth. The sun is not my friend. Your sister was given plenty of options and I have never been to a zoo that didn't carry sunscreen in the gift shop. She made her own bed here.", "INFO\n\nDid you offer to let her have it and pay you so you could buy more?", "A'pieu Pure Block Aqua Sun Gel user here!  You are NTA!  While not a super expensive sunscreen, it's not like I can rock down to the nearest shop to get a replacement bottle.  Your sister had way to many opportunities to protect herself from the sun", "Did no one think to try the gift shop?", "NTA. You offered her your sunscreen at the beginning. And she didn't forget, she *refused*. \n\nBy the time you feel yourself burning, it's too late, you need to get out of the sun.", "let me guess, she also won't bring a jacket when it's cold and then gets mad if you won't give her yours? NTA, lol", "Ah what zoo gift shop doesn't sell sunscreen. This seems selfish. Let ur sister use it and tell her to buy u another tube later. What person cares more about sunscreen than a person? This is a weird post!", "NTA, I would 100% do this", "If you're an Aussie and you don't share, your suncreen, especially with your family, Sheesh m8...pull ya head in will ya", "NTA.\n\nShe was given many opportunities to prepare, and she willfully disregarded them all. \n\nI also understand why you won\u2019t share your face sunscreen - those things are expensive, and are meant for the face and contain ingredients that will be wasted on other body parts. You are merely preventing an expensive waste of product.", "YTBFA THERE IS", "YTA- omg imagine being this protective over some fucking sunscreen \ud83e\udd23 I wear expensive face sunscreen too but will freely let someone use it, if they need it. It\u2019s not like she was going to use the whole bottle.", "Yuuuuuup. OP gave her FOUR chances to not get sunburnt like an unsupervised child, sis doesn't get to use freakin expensive face lotion instead of the multiple reasonable options she was given.", "I wonder if the sister found the post because someone is literally disliking every single NTA comment lol", "This. NTA.", "She's 23 fgs, grow the hell up.", "Exactly, she's an adult but didn't act like one.\n\nYou should put on sunscreen some time before exposure, so when she started to get burned, it was already too late anyways. Been there, done that myself but I didn't blame anyone else, because it was my own fault.", "Thank you. I came here for this comment. Walk her butt to the gift shop and let her buy her own sunscreen.", "To be fair, it would be very hard to put sunscreen on with hooves.", "I\u2019ve said I wish I used a different sunscreen lol.", "Yeah, and?", "I don't know. I told my sister she could try checking there, but she didn't want that.", "Man I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re the first I\u2019ve seen with this take. The sister was stupid, yeah, but to deny her sunscreen totally out of spite (OP offered to let her use it earlier) is just spiteful, it\u2019s not somehow justified because she made a bad choice earlier and then changed her mind. Isn\u2019t her changing her mind the desired outcome? OP is just perpetuating conflict out of pettiness; being right about sunscreen doesn\u2019t make that chill.\n\nIt\u2019s also not that ridiculous to assume someone who offered you sunscreen and then brought that sunscreen on the trip (because sunscreen must be reapplied every few hours anyway) would also allow you to use it later.", "Did you miss the part where her sister is a grown ass adult who repeatedly *refused* sunscreen? She didn\u2019t forget at all.", "This is the only sane take", "Then the sister can wear the flannel. If a friend adult can\u2019t care about their own health it\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to do so. Especially when she offered plenty of solutions.", "It's \u20ac26 for 50 ml. And it was more than half empty, so it probably would have only covered one of her arms lol. \n\nAnd I did offer to share! My body sunscreen. Before we left.", "Face sunscreen does tend to be different, less harsh", "Except the sunscreen OP had was not for the body, I know the container for my face sunscreen is MUCH smaller than for the body, there may not have even been enough for adequate coverage, plus it is very likely a lot more expensive. The sister should have gone to a gift shop and bought herself some sunscreen that was suitable.", "Sure, but I offered her my flannel, which would have covered her skin prevented it?", "I wish I could use normal, but that really burns around my eyes, face sunscreen doesn't. So for me it's worth it. Looks less greasy too.", "Buddy, no. Asian face sunscreens are definitely not the same thing as a body sunscreen.", "Why should it be up to her when she offered to put in sisters bag and she was told no. Oh I forgot when someone says no you\u2019re supposed to keep asking or do what they don\u2019t want. Would that have made her NTA?", "She is important. That's why I reminded her, offered her sunscreen twice, and offered her a way to cover up. \n\nI'm all for helping others, but I'm also for personal responsibility.", "It isn\u2019t the point of how much it costs. It\u2019s how her sister turned down four , five different options then still chose to get burned. It isn\u2019t on op to cover stupid.", "Personally, I would have offered her the bottle if she venmo\u2019d me the cost of a new bottle plus shipping. I\u2019m fairly sure that she would have said no because she doesn\u2019t want to pay that much either. But it\u2019s fine to waste OP\u2019s expensive face sunscreen if she doesn\u2019t have to pay for it", "As someone recently diagnosed with melanoma, I was ready to come in here saying YTA. But you tried like 5 different times to give her sunscreen. I wear a face sunscreen that's $30 a bottle and would basically be empty if you tried to use it for your whole upper body.\n\nNTA", "I came here to say \"Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of (sister's) own actions.\"", "A 23 year old should know better.", "the 23 year old should grow up.", "What\u2019s your point ?", "Plus it's face sunscreen, I'm not positive but the one my family uses at least has a much lower spf than our body sunscreen. It probably wouldn't have even done much, just waste ops nice purchase.", "As someone who burns easily, it always seems to take more if I forget and burn before applying.", "Seems like it would be easier than getting your sister to. :(", "Op offered body sun screen not the face one . You cannot read apparently .", "Good on you! She has to grow up at some point", "Yes, but offering someone a flannel it\u2019s hot out and you have sunscreen is the exact type of thing an asshole would do to be able to say, \u201cwell I tried\u201d", "you can try a different brand, or mix normal sunscreen with a regular facecream", "Plus a little extra for idiot tax", "Point is the 21y/o new to use sunscreen, tried to have the 23y/o to use sunscreen multiple times and then the 23y/o is mad at the 21y/o. If the 21y/o knew better so should the 23y/o.", "It depends largely on the brand. I use a Japanese sunscreen that is 50SPF. My face and chest tends to burn more easily so I typically use higher SPF on it.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I accept your opinion, but I did really try. 4 times. I felt like she had most (all?) of the responsibility there, and at some point it's on them. \n\nShe tried nothing. They probably sold sunscreen at the gift shop, but she refused to even check.", "I've tried quite a few. I just have sensitive skin + eyes. I don't think mixing it is recommended, you get less protection that way. \n\nI don't mind spending a bit more if that means no tearing eyes though.", "Then OP would be bad, since presumably she doesn't want sis to be burned and was just angry that she saw the problem coming and tried repeatedly to prevent it", "Ok but that\u2019s not what the commenter implied with their comment", "Like I said, her getting burnt is completely on her, and I have zero blame on you for that. Not sharing your sunscreen was still an asshole thing to do. Did she have other options? She didn\u2019t explore? Yes, that\u2019s exactly why her burn is not your fault. You put making a point in front of helping your sister. Depending on your sister, that could even have been the correct decision, and that would change my opinion, but I don\u2019t know your sister well enough to see if she is chronically like this or this one off day of bad decision", "I have this issue too. Do you mind to share what you use?", "At some point it becomes less about empathy and more about letting people fuck around and find out in the least words possible"]}
