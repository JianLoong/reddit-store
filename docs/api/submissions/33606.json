You already have to share the space with three others, which requires its own level of compromise and diplomacy. Why should you have to extend that to people who aren\u2019t even part of the rental setup? \n\nAnd your friend who keeps having these obnoxiously loud parties until 3AM? She\u2019s very, very, very clearly the asshole for exactly the reason you screamed at her: She\u2019s being repeatedly inconsiderate to a shocking degree. God, I don\u2019t miss student accommodations one bit. There\u2019s always one asshole who\u2019s there solely for the socializing.", "NTA. Your roommate needs to learn an important lesson: only break one rule at a time. Want to have house guests longer than permitted? Then make sure the noise levels are well within reasonable expectations/times.", "So annoying when room mates are jerks.\n\nReport her. Screw it", " NTA  we are not talking about grade school or HS mean girl stuff.  We are talking about college...time to grow up and get courteous.  Most apartment buildings have a 10 or 11 curfew for noise.  This should not be any different.  If you are stressed about exams (which should Always be scheduled BEFORE holiday breaks, and exhausted by such discourtesy, I say screaming was an act of desperation.  Forgive yourself.  You asked her, and They continued until a ridiculous hour.  It is nonsense that You should be chastised for letting your anger show.", "NTA, but Niya is an understandable AH. She refuses to believe she's done anything wrong because she's probably never lived with other adults, believing she can do whatever she wants in her home. Too bad she's wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou tried asking her like an adult to have respect for your sleep, which should be common sense when sharing living quarters with others. She SAID okay and acknowledged your complaint, but disrespected you by continuing to do it. \n\nDon't freak out on her, but make it clear you find it disrespectful and that she's not really leaving you with any other choice but to report if she doesn't knock it off.", "Nta. \nStart recording and taking notes of anything worth complaining about and report. Keeping record/proof is the only way to get new accomodations if necessary.", "NTA", "ESH - your roommate is def an AH - rude and inconsiderate - but you can't go losing your cool and threatening people when you get frustrated. If she continues with the loudness at ridiculous hours then make a formal complaint if you feel you must - just don't scream and yell and lob threats, especially at her guests who were invited.", "ESH.  Rommate is inconsiderate.  But screaming at her only ups the drama.  Don't threaten to report.  Just report.", "NTA", "ESH. You should report her for the noise and guests and let that process happen. She shouldn\u2019t be letting her friends stay over.", "ESH with the A mostly on her side. 3am is totally unreasonable to be making noise, but you are in a thin walled apartment where sleep is never going to be great. You could have handled it better than screaming and waking *more* people up.", "You\u2019re not wrong but you\u2019re an asshole for screaming at them. If you want to be heard, you need to communicate more effectively. Screaming is a quick way to make them more oppositional to you and more likely to keep doing what their doing to spite you.", "NTA\n\nTime to kick her out. I\u2019d rather pay double rent than have to deal with inconsiderate immature children. And to hell with Christmas break. What she and her merry band of idiots are doing is rude and disruptive. Or\u2026 you and your other roommates can wait until she\u2019s sleeping and make a bunch of noise every day.

It might be Christmas break for some people, but you still have exams that you're studying for.
