I thought that they were absolutely delicious and I bought the 4 pack for MYSELF. Me and my roommates were also burdened with having to take care of a 4 year old kid for Christmas. One of my roommates is dating a girl with a kid from a prior relationship and she dumped him on us at the last minute on Christmas Eve. She tasked us with tucking him on and making sure he gets his presents while she went down to Atlantic City to party with her friends. (We live in Manhattan)\n\nIt was Christmas Eve night and the kid was telling us that we needed to leave cookies and milk out for Santa or else he'd skip our apartment. We didn't have any cookies other than my Crumbl Cookies and those weren't going to be an option. None of us felt like going out and searching the city for a place that was open at a late hour, so my roomate suggested that we put out two of my cookies. I immediately declined. He explained that the cookies obviously weren't going to be eaten and that we needed to just leave them sitting out by the tree for a few hours to trick the kid. I still wasn't budging on that.\n\nI was going off of the general principle that they were my cookies that I paid for with my money and I had the final say. My final say was that they weren't going to just sit out for an imaginary being just to trick some kid that I just met. The kid was stomping his feet and screaming about Santa skipping our apartment if we didn't leave him cookies. I searched the fridge and suggested that we just leave Santa a leftover meatball sandwich, but the kid wouldn't go for it. Me and him got into a screaming match over my cookies and I was so pissed off at the whole thing, that I just grabbed the 4 pack and threw them out of our window and onto the streets below. One of my roomates just ran to a nearby convenience store and bought some cookies there and that settled the kid down.\n\nThings were chilly between us yesterday morning. My roommates blamed me for the whole commotion, but I blamed them for them trying to get me to give up my cookies that I paid for. The kid is still with us since the mom is staying in Atlantic City for New Year's and none of my roommates are leaving me alone with the kid at all.

You\u2019ve got a better chance of the subway shutting down (it\u2019s happened maybe 5-6 times in the last 15 years) than the local bodega deviating from its regular hours (the non-24-hour ones are usually open from 5-6am to 1-3am.", "OP\u2019s post history reeks of narcissism", "Oh my god it's this guy!", "people digging up the OPs histories are the best it makes it juicier", "Weaponized nastiness AND incompetence.", "Not when OP is expected to deal with the child", "\ud83d\udc80", "If we\u2019re going to talk about overstimulation, think about how this kid felt when dropped off with a bunch of strangers on Christmas Eve. No mom, and then he\u2019s told to leave a leftover cold meatball sub out for Santa\u2026\nI have a hard time sympathizing with an adult when there is a four year old child suffering at the center of the issue.", "He is real but he\u2019s in prison, l climbing down kids chimneys in middle of the night, what did he expect", "if it is, it's part of a long term crumbl cookie conspiracy from the post history", "\ud83c\udfafYESYESYES FAKEFAKEFAKE!", "Take a look at his post history.  It's a ride. Cookie reviews and more asshole behavior.  This dude is legitimately a cookie monster.", "Not just any cookies, crumbl cookies. Never had them, but assume they aren\u2019t cheap.", "They wouldn't need to go stale, even, I'm sure they could have put them in a tupperware or something with Santa's name on it.", "Yes if this really happened then OP is the biggest brat and should never be even adjacent to a situation that involves supervising youth. Also, YTA", "Plot twist, OP is also 4. That's the only way i could excuse this kind of behavior. YTA", "I was when I snuck out Christmas Eve and caught my mom and dad giggling and munching cookies. Scandal!", "Formally known as Sid \ud83d\ude05", "Then the kid is the boyfriends responsibility and OP shouldn't be involved at all.", "My dad put out what he liked to eat and then he would eat it. \ud83d\ude02 We put out Pepsi and twinkies for him.", "Good idea, but I don\u2019t see the person who throws cookies out the window going to get some glitter and oatmeal together\u2026poor kid.", "That definitely would have been a strategy too. Although not sure an upset 4 year old would have been open to believing that.", "I just don't even see how that would work. 4 year olds escalate. How does screaming at one do anything. Besides of course how shitty it is to scream at a 4 year old in an apartment that's not home without their mother on Christmas Eve. Not that it was OP's job to replace the mom but screaming at a 4 year old seems too far.", "Sounds like an awesome way to go out. No one would believe anyone that said you died because a cookie hit you.", "Yeah, I don't even care if they're fake as long as they're funny. I wish the sub would allow a /f tag for fake stories so at least we would know but still be able to play along", "Sometimes I just run across something where I'm like \"wow, if they think there's a chance people will think it's cool to scream at a 4 year old and throw cookies out of a window just to spite them on Christmas, what else are they up to?\"", "If roommate agreed, then the roommate should have handled it without having to involve anyone else. At the very least, OP should look to get rid of the roommate, as they caused the whole thing.", "Oh my god you can\u2019t call the **police** because your roommate is babysitting a kid and you have to interact with the child. Do you people understand how society works.\n\nWah, Officer, I had to interact with a child without my consent! Arrest someone!", "The roommate should not have involved him, but it wouldn't be right to call social services because he didn't want to share a cookie.", "I never said that it was right, but that's not Op's responsibility. The moment the kid and Op started arguing the roommate should have stepped in to offer an alternative. Obviously there was a solution but instead of watching the kid or trying to de-escalate the situation Op's roommate was where? Literally all it took was two seconds to tell the kid \"hey, those are Op's cookies, let's leave them alone and go get some of our own for Santa\".", "Form a guy who can't figure out why girls don't wanna date him and his job doesn't want to make him a lead... Wonder what his problem could be", "They are having a PR crisis right now, maybe this is a sad attempt at creating buzz.", "This is the saddest post history of an OP that I have read in a while. Dude's family has basically disowned him on Christmas, he's been fired from his job, and he has to look after someone else's kid. The one bright spot in his life seems to be these cookies and he can't even have that in peace. Rock bottom is screaming at a child that isn't yours over cookies that you bought with your savings after being fired while obsessing over your crush whom you just found out was proposed to on Christmas. The only solace I can find here is that he hasn't posted about doing heroin.", "I don't buy them but I have friends who do, they are like $5 each. OP threw $20 if cookies out the window arguing with a 4 year old ...\n\n YTA OP Major AH. Grow up.", "We have them where I live. Recently had a double chocolate with hot gooey chocolate filling as well as an orange frosted one. They are big and delicious and yes, hella expensive. The face I made when I heard he threw them out the window\u2026", "There is no way this happened. For starters. Who the fuck leaves their 4 year old with a bunch of dudes on Christmas Eve? What bunch of dudes allows someone to dump their 4 year old on them on Christmas Eve? \nAnd lastly. It\u2019s fucking Manhattan. Walk in any direction 400 steps or less and there will be a deli or bodega that sells cookies. \n\nThis whole story reads like a whack attempt by some Crumbl intern to get Crumbl some viral clout.", "This did not happen\u2026he suggested leaving a meatball sandwich? Come on", "It's obvious that your parents ate santa too.", "You're probably also not the type to go partying in Atlantic City.", "Cool but the comment you\u2019re responding to suggests calling CPS. How\u2019s that going to go? Hi, I\u2019m calling bc my roommate is babysitting his gf\u2019s kid. Ok yes and? Well it\u2019s Christmas. So? So she\u2019s a bad mom for leaving the kid so you have to come take him to foster care.\n\nLike, what is this call trying to achieve? I stg people on here think CPS is there for when you want to tell your teacher that someone is being naughty.", "Not everyone has the luxury of not being able to work on Xmas.", "My son is 15 and I can't imagine him not being with me Christmas Eve/ Day. Like what kind of mom leaves her kid to go party on Christmas?!", "My Mama put out reese's peanut butter cups and Pepsi for Santa one year, her reasoning being that \"I think maybe Santa might appreciate something different this year besides the usual cookies and milk\". {Her favorite candy was Reese's & she was basically addicted to Pepsi \ud83d\ude01} Thanks for reminding me of a sweet memory that I hadn't thought about in a long time!", "Fair point. Glitter was extremely common in my house due to my moms job", "Because OP has the mentality of a 4yo too. Got so excavated in an argument with a 4yo that he had to throw his beloved cookies out a window.", "thank god op is so self absorbed he didn\u2019t realize a throwaway would hide his general idiocy", "Honestly- I like Crumbl cookies. They\u2019re tasty and a decent dessert. But\u2026theyre cookies. They\u2019re not worth screaming at someone over, never mind a kid, because again- cookies.", "I mean all op had to do was go into his room and shut the door with his cookies, instead he had to have a literal screaming match with a toddler and then throw a tantrum", "this sub jumps to calling the police as the first solution. they\u2019re either kids or people so privileged to think it\u2019s a good idea", "The argument with the child should\u2019ve never happened, and that is on OP for acting like a four year old himself. There are absolutely 0 excuses for the behavior that was described.", "What is their PR crisis?", "Instead of leaving them on a plate where they still would have been edible. I don't know if I'm more appalled at arguing with a 4 year old, like a 4 year old, and think thinking OP would win or the grave injustice done to the cookies. So much YTA. In so many ways.", "Op loses his shit at being asked to leave cookies out for maybe 10 minutes tops, and goes on a tangent about how these are his, he wants them,  he hates kids and no one can have them...,\n only to THROW THE COOKIES INTO STREET. \n\nIt must be exhausting to be so petty and insufferable. Karma is he doesn't get the cookies", "Andddd she\u2019s leaving him there for until New Year\u2019s?! This can not be real life.", "Glad I'm not the only one who went straight to this conclusion.", "Exactly sounds like plot of some lifetime holiday movie.", "Crumbl^(r) Cookies: so good you'll ruin a 4 year old's christmas", "Happy cake day", "I apologize for any confusion. I don\u2019t support calling CPS in most cases that AITA jumps to saying calling CPS, this one included. My comment is in response to the commenter who said the boyfriend may have agreed but not the roommates. That\u2019s what I meant was regardless of what or wasn\u2019t agreed, the poor planning/problem solving of mom is awkward - especially at Christmas. Who dumps their kid for an entire week with what appears to be essentially strangers?  \n\nI do understand emergencies happen and maybe mom has no other support or options, and OP is a soulless grinch. I don\u2019t know. It just seems very strange to me as a mom with kids the same age to completely bounce on the week of Christmas to new years and not be around.", "Yeah but OP stated the mom went to party with friends in Atlantic City. Leaving your kids because you have to work is very different from choosing to leave to go party with friends.", "Even if it was for work (which it doesn\u2019t seem it was - also considering that the kid was there Xmas eve and is there until new years) that\u2019s a long ass time to be away from your kid and not have arranged a safe and comfortable space for the child to be at. \n\nThings happen in life that are unexpected. I get that - but this seems like a lot of poor planning and decision making on moms part.", "She went to party tho", "We left out apple pie and beer.  My eldest son figured it out because he knew those were two of his dad\u2019s favorite things.", "I am glad you have happy memories. :) \n\nMy favourite time was staying with my grandparents over the holidays. Grandma left out cigarettes beside the cookies without even thinking. \n\nShe then told me that Santa smokes like a chimney and I was like 5 and it made sense to me. \ud83d\ude06 The guy they hired to play Santa was their friend, who smoked, and they left it out for him with cash inside. \n\nI think these things are so silly looking back, but I find them hilarious.", "I\u2019m in a glitter-type line of work except I hate it. So mine stays at school. Lol", "Which is nuts because people bring up his previous posts in his other previous posts so he knows this is a thing that doesn't help his case. Hah.\n\nIt would be funnier if I weren't legitimately worried for this girl he is obsessed with. Yikes.", "Should they have had a screaming match with a kid? No. Then again, they were also likely at their wits end. This should not have been put on them at all.", "You're right, the roommate shouldn't have let the kid pester op in the first place.", "Busted for breaking labor laws:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20221220", "Haha. I stopped reading long before that claim.", "Thanks!!", "I was replying to the part about them saying they would never leave their kids. Some people have to.", "Let's just ignore that fact for just a second and realize that a grown man screamed at a child because they didn't want to put their cookies out for Santa (they wouldn't have been eaten) and instead threw them out the window. You're right the gf shouldn't have left her kid with op, the poor roommates now have to deal with 2 children cause op can't figure out conflict resolution or just walk away."]}
