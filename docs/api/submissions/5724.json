I thought that they were absolutely delicious and I bought the 4 pack for MYSELF. Me and my roommates were also burdened with having to take care of a 4 year old kid for Christmas. One of my roommates is dating a girl with a kid from a prior relationship and she dumped him on us at the last minute on Christmas Eve. She tasked us with tucking him on and making sure he gets his presents while she went down to Atlantic City to party with her friends. (We live in Manhattan)\n\nIt was Christmas Eve night and the kid was telling us that we needed to leave cookies and milk out for Santa or else he'd skip our apartment. We didn't have any cookies other than my Crumbl Cookies and those weren't going to be an option. None of us felt like going out and searching the city for a place that was open at a late hour, so my roomate suggested that we put out two of my cookies. I immediately declined. He explained that the cookies obviously weren't going to be eaten and that we needed to just leave them sitting out by the tree for a few hours to trick the kid. I still wasn't budging on that.\n\nI was going off of the general principle that they were my cookies that I paid for with my money and I had the final say. My final say was that they weren't going to just sit out for an imaginary being just to trick some kid that I just met. The kid was stomping his feet and screaming about Santa skipping our apartment if we didn't leave him cookies. I searched the fridge and suggested that we just leave Santa a leftover meatball sandwich, but the kid wouldn't go for it. Me and him got into a screaming match over my cookies and I was so pissed off at the whole thing, that I just grabbed the 4 pack and threw them out of our window and onto the streets below. One of my roomates just ran to a nearby convenience store and bought some cookies there and that settled the kid down.\n\nThings were chilly between us yesterday morning. My roommates blamed me for the whole commotion, but I blamed them for them trying to get me to give up my cookies that I paid for. The kid is still with us since the mom is staying in Atlantic City for New Year's and none of my roommates are leaving me alone with the kid at all.

As someone whose autistic dealing with a screaming kid throwing a fit, one that you didn't even sign up to watch, is rage worthy. Not saying it's right but under the same circumstances I'd react similarly.", "Bingo.", "You realize not all parents lie to their children, right?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

His response to a petulant child is to (*checks notes*) also be a petulant child. What kind of adult throws cookies out of a window?", "The boyfriend may well have agreed and roommate calls it dumping", "The mom sucks but the question was AITA for refusing to put out cookies. The answer is yes he is an AH.\n\nETA: OP getting into a screaming match with a literal four year old pushed it into YTA not ESH territory.", "He is obligated not to *scream* at a 4yo. OP also made his own life more difficult, purely to spite a young child. The fact that the child's mother is neglectful does not excuse OP's behaviour.", "Did the post contain a question regarding the mother and from the mother? No? Then that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t commented on. Obviously she\u2019s a massive asshole. But so is OP. Who the hell is cruel to a small child like this? He didn\u2019t even have to share them. Just provide the illusion of him doing so for a half hour at most before the kids goes to bed. Jfc people are so selfish and horrible\u2026 that you could say this is\u2026.

I can\u2019t imagine choosing to leave my kids on Christmas Day with strangers. I mean. I\u2019d never do that to begin with. But especially not on Christmas. I made people cuz I wanted to be around them.", "Of the boyfriend agreed but no one spoke to Op, and Op was still expected to pitch in, that's dumping.", "Then the roommate should have dealt with the kid in the first place. Op should have never had any contact with the kid other than passing by and s friendly hello."]}
