{"id": 5845, "submission_id": "zx9sup", "title": "AITA for having a gender free gender reveal party to appease our parents", "selftext": "My wife is pregnant with our first child.  All we care about is that the baby is born healthy. Boy or girl doesn't matter to us.  We just want a healthy pregnancy and birth.  Anything beyond that seems silly.  I am in no way mocking any culture or family tradition that prizes one sex above another.  \n\nMy mom and dad as well as my wife's parents and step parents however are crazy about the idea of gender reveal parties.  Although to be perfectly honest it has been mostly expressed by the grandmothers to be. They missed out on the whole trend for the first few grandchildren because of the whole COVID thing. And they won't take no for an answer. \n\nSo they were pushing us to have a gender reveal party.  We don't want one.  We want to be surprised. We love the idea of not knowing. In this day and age where you can read spoilers online for books/movies/tv shows/video games it seems awesomely anachronistic to not know something.  \n\nAnyway they would not shut up about it. It was a constant thing when we spoke to them. So we decided to appease them. We spoke to my wife's best friend who is also her cousin. We planned a gender reveal party and they all contributed since they wanted a big deal.  We did not ask for money.  They volunteered it and once again would not take no for an answer.  \n\nWe had a great party and BBQ. It was good to see friends and family we hadn't in a while. \n\nWhen it came time for the reveal everyone had those little handheld confetti cannons. We said that only a few had the actual colored confetti and the rest were multicolor just in case someone went early.  \n\nAnd it was actually really cool.  The video and pictures are cool and everyone had fun shooting them off. Until everyone noticed that there were no blue or pink cannons.  We said thanks to everyone for coming and wishing us a happy and healthy baby.  \n\nMost people got the joke but my parents in particular were pissed.  They waited until everyone left to confront us \n\nThey said that we were making fun of them. I said that I had told them a dozen times that we didn't want to do it.  They were angry about wasting everyone's time. I said that they wanted a gender reveal party. The party and anticipation was the fun part.  The gender was private. We don't even know.  \n\nWell we just got back from seeing them over Christmas and they are still upset. I told them that they were the only ones still pouting about the party and that they should drop it.  \n\nBut they still say that they raised an uncivilized jerk and that I should not have teased them so publicly.  \n\nI do feel bad for getting their hopes up but I'm not sure we were wrong.  \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nDid all of you guys seriously have to teach your parents that NO MEANS NO?  I'm only asking because you seem to think that eight weeks of saying no isn't enough for grown adults to get the idea.", "created_utc": 1672234723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx9sup/aita_for_having_a_gender_free_gender_reveal_party/", "score": 583, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And how are you supposed to reveal the gender if no one knows the gender? You\u2019re the baby\u2019s parents and they are angry that YOU don\u2019t want to know the gender? That\u2019s way out of line on their part. I\u2019d say cut contact for a bit. Let them stew.", "NTA, ~~Gender reveal parties are a plague upon this Earth~~\n\nIt's your kid, and your choice. As much as it sucks to have gotten their hopes up, you are under no obligation to appease them by doing something you have no interest in doing, and it's really none of their business what the baby's gender is. ~~Gender is a social construct anyway~~\n\nHopefully your parents stop acting like children once the baby is born.

Perhaps they will learn to accept \"no\" as an answer.", "NTA. Firstly, I come from a culture where they prize one gender over the other and you have every right to shame those people.

Sounds like they'll want to barge into your house when they want cuz it's their baby!", "NTA. I'd consider this an excellent use of malicious compliance. You gave them a party like they asked.

Spouse and I are raising this child and we are not going to accept anyone pushing their parenting ideas on us, including you. If we are seeking advice, we will ask and then we will decide what to do. Spouse and I are not raising this child with a committee. If you have a big concern, you can mention it ONCE. Then drop it.

Your family really needs to decide if they care more about knowing the gender now vs having a good relationship when the baby is born, because the pouting and complaining gets old.", "NTA. It sounds to me like the whole lot of them need a lesson in respecting your boundaries as a parent. They're trying to take control away from you and haven't learned the meaning of NO.", "NTA.

However, I LOVE your take on it. I love what you\u2019ve done here. \n\nYou are exactly right. They wanted the gender reveal party. They got one. All they didn\u2019t get, is the actual gender. \n\nThey have no right to this information, and you and your partner are the only ones who can decide whether you know in advance or not. \n\nTell them to get a grip. I\u2019d imagine their mood will change when the baby is born. \n\nCongratulations! Great way to keep it a surprise!", "Let them know if they continue with that attitude they won\u2019t see the baby.

I don\u2019t understand why your parents are so obsessed with knowing, it\u2019s a bit weird. Even if you did know no obligation to tell them.", "NTA.  Grandparents desire to know gender does not trump parents' desire not to know.  I didn't want to know the gender of either of my two pregnancies.  First one had the cord around the neck and after pushing it out, I had to repeatedly ask what is it, boy or girl?  Doctor finally laid her on my chest and said it's a girl.  Second one, very clearly told sonogram tech I did not want to know the gender.  Stupidly she says 'oh I see it!'  What else could it be but a penis?  I get annoyed even thinking about it and he's 22!", "NTA", "NTA.

Gender reveal parties are dumb. I would never go to one.", "NTA\n\nI, personally, think that gender reveal parties are stupid.

They may be family but it\u2019s none of their business. Glad you and your wife stuck together your guns.", "NTA my wife and I waited until out first son was born to find out the gender, we wanted the surprise.

Would have been E-S-H if you weren't planning to reimburse them.", "NTA it was clearly the only way it was going to get through to them, you proved how dumb these parties are to them and now they\u2019re butt hurt about it", "NTA. Maybe they should stop acting like pushy entitled jerks.\n\nOr you could tell them that one of the multicolor cannons had one piece of confetti in it marked with either a vagina or penis and it\u2019s not your fault they didn\u2019t dig through the confetti piece by piece for the mini vagina/penis, and you are disappointed that your child\u2019s grandparents to be are so lazy.", "NTA this was brilliant.

You might try to have an intelligent discussion about baby and them listening to you as parents but I\u2019m not sure they will be able to see past their wants. This was my in laws and to a lesser degree my parents . It made having children more difficult for us but we managed by staying firm. Maybe indulging in chocolate and adult beverages after each encounter. Good luck.", "NTA! Sounds like you handled it perfectly. Your parents need to realize you are your own person and can\u2019t live your life for them.", "NTA.  You seem to have turned out well considering the narcissists that raised you.

All we care about is that the baby is born healthy. Boy or girl doesn't matter to us.  We just want a healthy pregnancy and birth.  Anything beyond that seems silly.  I am in no way mocking any culture or family tradition that prizes one sex above another.  \n\nMy mom and dad as well as my wife's parents and step parents however are crazy about the idea of gender reveal parties.  Although to be perfectly honest it has been mostly expressed by the grandmothers to be. They missed out on the whole trend for the first few grandchildren because of the whole COVID thing. And they won't take no for an answer. \n\nSo they were pushing us to have a gender reveal party.  We don't want one.  We want to be surprised. We love the idea of not knowing. In this day and age where you can read spoilers online for books/movies/tv shows/video games it seems awesomely anachronistic to not know something.  \n\nAnyway they would not shut up about it. It was a constant thing when we spoke to them. So we decided to appease them. We spoke to my wife's best friend who is also her cousin. We planned a gender reveal party and they all contributed since they wanted a big deal.  We did not ask for money.  They volunteered it and once again would not take no for an answer.  \n\nWe had a great party and BBQ. It was good to see friends and family we hadn't in a while. \n\nWhen it came time for the reveal everyone had those little handheld confetti cannons. We said that only a few had the actual colored confetti and the rest were multicolor just in case someone went early.  \n\nAnd it was actually really cool.  The video and pictures are cool and everyone had fun shooting them off. Until everyone noticed that there were no blue or pink cannons.  We said thanks to everyone for coming and wishing us a happy and healthy baby.  \n\nMost people got the joke but my parents in particular were pissed.  They waited until everyone left to confront us \n\nThey said that we were making fun of them. I said that I had told them a dozen times that we didn't want to do it.  They were angry about wasting everyone's time. I said that they wanted a gender reveal party. The party and anticipation was the fun part.  The gender was private. We don't even know.  \n\nWell we just got back from seeing them over Christmas and they are still upset. I told them that they were the only ones still pouting about the party and that they should drop it.  \n\nBut they still say that they raised an uncivilized jerk and that I should not have teased them so publicly.  \n\nI do feel bad for getting their hopes up but I'm not sure we were wrong.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I\u2019m old fashioned too and didn\u2019t know the genders of any of them before birth.

They should have respected your wishes", "NTA. \n\nThis is YOURS and your wife\u2019s baby, and it\u2019s weird that they were all so insistent on a gender reveal party when it\u2019s not even a tradition that their generation practiced when they were having babies/raising children. Teasing them in the way you did was obviously not malicious, and if they wish to not be mocked then they should stay in their lane. My only criticism is that even though they volunteered to pay towards the party, you probably shouldn\u2019t have accepted it and maybe the right thing to do is to pay them back.\n\nI feel like this could be a sign that they will try to overstep or undermine you when it concerns things around how you choose to raise your child and you will probably need to remain firm with your boundaries if they continue to behave in this manner.", "NTA - as an adult who has a proper understanding of boundaries and the ability to communicate the word NO to my parents, they on the other hand, DO NOT have the ability (or respect of said boundaries) to UNDERSTAND the word NO so it can be easy (for some other posters) to tell you to stand firm with your boundaries but parents are parents and sometimes need to be shown what no truly looks like, in your case a \"non-gender\" gender reveal. They got the message but now are pouting because it wasn't their desired outcome for control. \n\nSometimes we need to be a-holes just to shut people (sometimes it's our own parents) up. You are NTA and if THEY don't like to understand NO going forward, remind them of this situation and maybe they'll back off.\n\nNTA", "I fucking HATE gender reveal parties. You, OP, are a bloody genius and NTA.", "Nta", "NTA.\nWhat part of we (the parents) don\u2019t want to know the gender did they not understand? Have they always disregarded your wants/needs/boundaries?", "NTA\nIt is YOUR and your wife's baby - not theirs. \nThe grandparents should honor your wishes and chill the eff out. If you have to tell people repeatedly your wishes they are not going to listen. The party sounds like fun and it appears the family was able to get together and visit. I think some people have lost sight of what gatherings should be for.\nIf you feel guilty about taking any contributions from people who are now mad feel free to return them. But 100% NTA", "NTA. I love how you handled it, personally! The thing is, unless you want a bunch of blue things or pink things on-hand, you don't really need to know beforehand. Both of you, the baby's parents, chose to wait. Good enough. Everybody still got to have a party and it sounds like it was a great time! Every grandparent in this situation needs to take a step back. It was your choice, you made it, and they need to respect that.", "NTA, but the parents on the other hand... AH.  They need to respect your boundaries and the fact they tried to turn it back on you is just shameful.  I hope this isn't a scene for things to come cuz I'd have to cut that toxicity out of my life.", "NTA, tell them that the more they complain, the longer they will have to wait to meet the baby. That will probably shut them right up.", "NTA. \nGender reveal parties are tacky af and if you the parents don\u2019t want to know then no one else needs to. Thanks for doing your part to make this silly new \u201ctradition\u201d disappear.

This was funny and you communicated this clearly you didn\u2019t want a party. Gender reveal parties are dumb if you\u2019re gonna reveal it just do it conveniently. Seems like people are misjudging from poor reading comprehension. You said no.", "NTA... I actually love this! Personally, I think the big gender reveal thing is ridiculous and a waste of money. On a more serious note, the attempts to go bigger and more extravagant has caused many of the forest fires we've had here in the US. We even had one that decided to pollute a river. The trend just needs to die.", "NTA. Cute way to handle an overbearing situation--the confetti cannons sound fun. As a parent of a trans child, the whole gender reveal thing is really overdone (and a bit silly when you think about it). I'm glad you drew a boundary in the most polite possible way.", "NTA. Gender reveal parties are weird as hell and kinda creepy. They're not even named correctly, since technically they should be called sex reveal parties.\n\nGood on you for not letting them pressure you into telling a bunch of grown adults who have no need to know, whether your baby will have a penis or a vagina.", ">I am in no way mocking any culture or family tradition that prizes one sex above another.\n\nCan I?", "NTA", "NTA. I find it weird that parents still want to control their adult children\u2019s lives. After you and your wife both told them, multiple times, you didn\u2019t want to do this, they insisted. So instead of telling them no you complied but in your own way. \nI think it was brilliant to do it the way you did. I also appreciate the fact that you and your wife enjoy not sharing everything on social media.", "NTA. I don't agree with those who say you should have stood your ground and had no party. I like that you had a party to celebrate a healthy baby soon to join the family.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing I could say is you could always pay them back the money they gave you for the party, but, honestly, they're not even owed that. They bullied you into having a gender reveal. My wife and I didn't know my daughter's gender until she was born (she refused to cooperate at the ultrasound, which is just so her \ud83e\udd23). I think gender reveals are weird, why is everyone so concerned about the genitals of an unborn child?", "Gender reveals are awful. In-laws begged for one and we held our ground. Sharing that moment together in the hospital was one of the best, most miraculous moments of my life. Would never trade that away for some whacky tacky \u201creveal\u201d to make others feel involved. I choose not to attend reveals.", "Esh. Your parents for badgering you about the sex of the baby\u2026it\u2019s YOUR baby and YOUR experience and they should be embarrassed about trying to take that special reveal at the moment of birth away from you. You guys are AHs for agreeing to do this and making it into a big deal only to troll them. NO is a full sentence and you are going to need to say it a lot more and be very firm in it when the baby is here. It can be exhausting and annoying but you can also avoid them (and tell them why) if they don\u2019t respect your wishes.", "NTA. This was a classic case of \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d. They wanted a party, they still technically got one. If they want to be upset because it didn\u2019t go their way, that\u2019s their problem, not yours.", "NTA! I absolutely loathe gender reveals, thankfully they were not a thing when I had kids. With my first I knew it was a boy when I was 3 months pregnant. But I was also cognizant of the fact that I could be wrong! In any case, I told my midwives office I DID NOT want to know but an ultrasound tech told me my baby was a girl around my 8th month. I informed her that she was wrong and continued to think I was having a boy. And then my baby was born. And he was a boy. So grateful that I didn\u2019t care either way but I\u2019m still salty about it 20+ years later.\n\nEdit: got caught up in that story telling! Grandparents will do a lot of things that annoy their kids. Discuss things with your spouse and present a united front. Your folks need to calm tf down, you weren\u2019t mocking them.", "First off they are \u201cgenital reveal\u201d parties and they are stupid to begin with, and second, as the parents you have 100% exclusive say on whether to have this ritual. Anyone pressuring you to do this against your will is a selfish AH that doesn\u2019t care about your feelings.\n\nETA; NTA", "YTA because you lied.  Everyone thought it was a gender reveal party because you told them it was.  You took money and implied.  That makes you an ah.  If you let people bully you into doing things you don\u2019t want to do, are you sure you\u2019re ready to be parents?  Sounds very immature to me.", "NTA because I think you handled this in a very cute and fun way. It is unfortunate that your parents can not laugh about themselves, but everyone seemingly had a great time, and I think that's what matters.", "NTA. But by \"appeasing\" them you've really opened the floodgate. You should have slammed your foot down--hard.", "NTA kinda genius honestly. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "ESH. They should have accepted your \u201cNo\u201d and you lied and took their money. Although I do admire your level of passive aggression, would have been better to stick with adulting and using your words vs lying.", "ESH. \n\nI think you should have just stood your ground and not thrown a party, which *really*was to mock them. \n\nLearn to hold boundaries NOW because you are in for it with these types of grandparents.", "NTA. They should have dropped it when you both said no thank you the first time. \n\nWhen my three year old repeats the same question over and over again until you give in, I get on her level, look her in the eyes and firmly say \u2018I told you no and I will not say it again, if you ask again I will ignore you and be upset\u2019. Maybe it will work on adults too.", "NTA. We didn\u2019t know the sex with either of ours. It was a nice surprise. All will be revealed soon enough.", "NTA I think it\u2019s great that your both happy to wait until the baby arrives to find out what sex they are. We didn\u2019t find out what gender we were having and after a few complications 12hrs labour, emergency c section epidural not working, I ended up having a c section under general anaesthesia. I came round to be told by the doctor that my daughter was waiting for me. That memory sticks in my mind more than anything else that day, which was 10 yrs ago.", "NTA Your parents are emotionally manipulating you. They will continue this behavior. Start saying no to things now. Remind them that you said no repeatedly and they persisted to the point of having no care for what the two of you wanted.\n\nThere are no surprises left in life really. We loved finding out in the delivery room that we had a healthy baby girl. Almost 10 years later that moment fills my heart with joy.\n\nYou and your wife deserve that joy.", "NTA. Your parents are acting like entitled kids. Just because they \"missed out\" on the other announcements doesn't give them the right to boss you around. They pushed and found out that you and your wife will take not shit.

Glad you got a party to celebrate your baby!", "First off, NTA and my new internet hero for bumping this weird\u2026. Weird trend (if you won\u2019t mock it, I will). Clearly always shows that the family wanted one gender or the other and it\u2019s just antiquated and creepy and just\u2026. Ick\n\nBut INFO: why do you parents think it was teasing publicly? Did you and your wife go around and tell each guest as they got their cannon that \u201cthis entire event was specifically requested by the future grandparents, any results of the firing of confetti is a direct result of their insistence\u201d? Did the invite say \u201chosted by grandma and grandpa Forward-Reach3518\u201d? Yeah you made a mockery of a dumb trend, but it\u2019s not like you went out of your way to make sure everyone knew it was to mock them right?", "NTA.

They were the ones that were raised to be jerks \ud83d\ude02", "ESH\n\nYour parents and family should not have insisted that you have a gender reveal party. That was wrong of them and their continued nagging about it was wrong too. \n\nBut I do think you were wrong to pull this stunt. You did waste everyones time, and I imagine that those people who haven't complained to you about it, are probably quite annoyed but are too polite to say anything. I don't think your parents will be the only ones who think this was a bad idea. \n\nYou should have just stuck to your guns and not had the party at all.", "NTA\n\nI think you gotta ask them point blank if they\u2019re just gonna be grumpy about it and hang it over your head forever? Or is this serious and gonna be the hill they die on?\n\nI can imagine it\u2019s the first, and will be for the foreseeable future, but hopefully not intended heavily.

If you\u2019d shut down the party idea firmly enough for them to stop badgering you about it they would\u2019ve been butthurt as well.

Against your own wishes?? Sorry, but nope. You\u2019re not the one in the wrong here.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBasically you had a big baby shower and everybody had fun despite the minor detail of not knowing gender.  Seems totally legit to me.  I'm sorry your parents are making it all about them.\n\nI've been to baby showers where we didn't know gender. New parents need tons of crap that is totally independent of baby gender.

Loved the variety of gifts\u2014nothing gender-coded, just baby.", "NTA. I personally hate the gender reveal trend. It seems very tacky to me - especially when people show such an obvious preference for a particular gender. That, and the morons causing destruction with their \"reveal\" make me angry. Your parents and inlaws shouldn't force the issue, and should just hope for a trouble-free birth and a healthy baby. I think you handled it beautifully.", "NTA - it\u2019s your child, and they can\u2019t force you to find out the gender any earlier than you want to.", "NTA. First off, imho, the whole gender reveal party thing strikes me as absurd and I think anyone who is into them is probably an asshole. Second, you should've put your foot down and just said, \"No. We're not doing it. Period.\" same as you would with a toddler and you most definitely should've refused money without being up front about your plans. But I still say NTA because it's your kid and you shouldn't feel obligated to capitulate to grown adults acting like children. Third, \"wasting everyone's time\" ??? Oh, so spending time together, having a good day celebrating the anticipated birth of a new child with family...what was all that? A waste of time, apparently. I think I found the assholes.\n\nOne last thing I'll add, unimportant and irrelevant, but maybe thought-provoking... You wrote *\"We want to be surprised\"* which reminded me of how I used to think similarly about finding out the sex before birth and didn't want to know beforehand because \"I wanted to be surprised\" and then someone said, \"well, when you get a sonogram and the Dr tells you, won't you be surprised?\" and I was like, \"yeah.\"", "NTA - just tell them the baby was being difficult and wouldn't show the goods.

Weekly scans from 30 weeks on? Legs closed each & every time. At this point, even the nurses were curious. \n\nWe didn't find out until she came out. Ha!", "NTA.

Gender reveal parties are stupid anyway and enforce unhealthy binary gender stereotypes.\n\nI absolutely love how you handled it, you had a nice party in anticipation of your new arrival and you got to make your point.  A healthy birth is all that matters.", "NTA. They couldn\u2019t accept no for an answer and kept pushing you and your wife for selfish reasons. I think your gender reveal party is hilarious and a great response to the boundary stomping grandmothers to be. Hopefully they have learned their lesson.

I had a relative try to force me to do it last pregnancy, and ended up breaking up with my SO at the time anyways (different issues) just a couple of days before.

These children are going to see this one day and know that to certain people that they are lesser BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER! That is horrible! I\u2019ve (35F) been told that when my paternal grandmother found out I was a girl she was very disappointed because in her culture men (especially 1st born men) are highly valued. I only heard that 2nd hand and it still upset me to hear that I was disappointing family members before I was even born for something that is out of my control. If it had been recorded?

NTA.", "Right, but this isn't a \"was I polite\" sub", "The confrontation was private.", "Why should the guy have to teach his parents that no means no?", "I agree. This saying no loophole is something my 8 year old would do.", "Exactly. Tell them \"we've given our answer, we're not discussing it anymore\". If you have to leave or hang up when they don't stop, do it.  They'll get the message. OP's response of pretending to give in is really childish.", "No thanks. I remember growing up with them as parents. No means no. But they refused to accept it.", "I don't know that number. Care to try again.", "The family gave money even after op said no, there's no tricking. They decided to give it and did not take no for an answer. Op even proposed to give the money back", "Kind of the point.  They have since stopped asking about my baby's junk.", "Huh? All they said is that the kid is female presenting, how is that equal to raising someone to think they're not the gender they are? I don't get it.", "You are fully missing the point.  You and your wife handled this really badly.", "Right. You had a wonderful time because you got money for a party after lying about what it was really for.", "Catty + taking someone's money under false pretenses only then to publicly shame them = asshole", "But the spectacle was public with all the intent behind it", "So it doesn\u2019t mean no. It means act like entitled brats until you cave.", "Care to read it again? Low contact to none.", "No, the family gave them money after OP told them that they had given in and were now going to do the party. And giving it back is good of them but that doesn't mean they still weren't tricking them. Also 'forcing' is a funny word to use. They were being annoying, they didn't put a gun to their head and make them take it. OP could have and should have just been firm instead of making a petty show of the whole thing.", "Wow, you are not only mean but kinda creepy that you would refer to your unborn child that way.  You were deliberately cruel to your parents and you seem really happy with it. I hope you tell your kid about this some day and all the joy you took in making your parents the butt of a joke so that they can return the favor to you with no guilt whatsoever.", "What is the difference between female presenting and female? If there is none, why use it?", "They have stopped bothering us about the baby's genitals. That's a win.", "I offered to return their money. I only took it so they were not suspicious.", "OP elsewhere stated he will reimburse them, so it's a wash.", "So how was anyone dragged into anything?", "That still isn't a number.", "Uh no, that's what gender reveal parties are and it's why it's gross. It's like asking trans people what their assigned gender is. \n\nGender is assigned by what genitals you have when you are born, and you don't need to know what's in my pants or anyone else's", "I didn't say there is a difference, however I don't see how either of those are harmful to a child.", "you had to throw a party, piss people off, create a family drama and take to Reddit to figure out if you handled it right - that's a win for you?  When you could have just said no and got the same results?  Are you sure you're ready to be a parent?", "You are missing the point ...boundaries can and will be crossed but you did not have the spine to double down and consistently say no. You accepted their money, threw a faux gender reveal party and think it's a win.\n\n I hope you do better when you are parents and boundary are stomped on regarding your child.", "Right. You *lied* so they wouldn\u2019t be suspicious. Why can\u2019t you see that the reason your parents are mad at you is because of your deception? That\u2019s what you need to take responsibility for.", "The issue is the lie, not the money itself. OP needs to apologize for lying.", "Seriously? You invited them to something that was a lie. You said everyone got the joke, so the reveal was something they were part of. Do you know that they weren't also asking themselves why the fuck you brought them to a party that was intentionally misrepresented? Don't use your friends as pawns in your plot against your parents. Have some respect for the people in your life.", "So, you won't be revealing the gender, even after birth? All pronouns will be they/them? With a gender neutral name?", "Do you have children?  Are you going to teach them that no means no?  Are you going to be upset with your grandparents for not teaching that to their kids?", "I know why they are mad. I just don't think I'm the asshole necessarily.", "Lmao no, you call them by what they are assigned as once they're born. Not doing so can cause identity issues. But once they're old enough you explain that sometimes people don't feel like they are what they were assigned at birth and that if they ever feel like that you'll support them.\n\nThere is no need to know what the baby will be until they're born. All that matters is their health until that point. Hell even after they're born it isn't even that important outside of medical situations. And people who don't go for all the gender stuff usually go for neutral clothes and decor instead of the usual pink for girls, blue for boys stereotype.", "I already said ESH but if you came here just looking for sycophants who tell you what you want to hear, this isn\u2019t the place lol", "You don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem because it got you what you wanted. Wonder who taught you that?", "That's not what OP said. I'm still waiting on OP to answer. If it matters I think gender reveals are ridiculous.", "What we wanted was to not have a gender reveal party at all.", "Excellent point. OP did not fall far from the tree."]}
