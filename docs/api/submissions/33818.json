But speaking like this in front of the person she was shaming (and yes, she was shaming) was a horrible act. I kind of love the fact that Brysen was sticking up for his sister, even though he used \"inappropriate language\" (oh my / sarcasm intended). I really think that you should respect your elders until they cross the line, like Beth did.", "NTA\n\nPeople who think you need to go to \"top\" colleges are idiots.", "Yta for allowing your son to swear instead of speak up for himself in a mature way.\n\nMy kids all (3) went to elite schools (top 10s). My last one is at MIT rn. You simply can't let your emotions rule you if you think you're going to make it at a selective university.", "NTA OP.  Your sister sounds so much like my sister in law, and elitist people are the bane of society.", "ESH. He should apologize for telling her to f off. I don't personally think that should stand unchallenged.", "NTA. No crticism of your parenting here.  Whilst it\u2019s not Beth\u2019s business a 16 year old needs to learn how to deal with conflict a better way than telling someone to F off. He should apologise for that. Further, it sounds more like paisley is compared to him, not the other way around.\n\nBeth is not \u201celitist\u201d - if she was she would have thought it was all fine.  She isn\u2019t wrong about the world - but I can\u2019t help feeling that if paisley was the one with the extra curriculars and Brysen wasn\u2019t, she might have said nothing? It seems like her comments were more about gender?", "NTA. Your sister has no place to tell you how to parent your kids. She's the one who needs to apologize for crossing that line.", "ESH - and wow did that escalate quickly. She was being pushy and making your daughter feel bad about her choices/personality. But name calling and cursing at someone is uncalled for. Instead off getting your point across and defending your daughter, you turned her aunt into the victim and quite frankly made a mess of things.\n\nHas anyone even asked how paisley is doing? First she was made to feel bad about herself, then probably embarrassed by the whole scene that followed.", "NTA. Brysen was just telling her the truth in a dog eat dog world. Because that is the response she will get when she starts telling others what they should have done.", "Why is Beth an elitist prick, not just a prick?", "NTA. Your sister overstepped by presuming to correct your parenting decision. She embarrassed one twin, and the other twin rose to his sibling\u2019s defense. Good for him. The language was too extreme, but so was your sister\u2019s shaming. Good for you for standing up for your kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a SIL who is obsessed with \"top colleges\" and despite her oldest being a much stronger fit for a major state university, pushed them into a smaller \"elite\" school. He dropped out because it was a terrible fit for him and is now taking classes at the local CC while working full time.\n\nThe mythology of \"elite\" schools is out of control. Often the hardest part is getting in. College is what you make of it and you can get just as good of an undergraduate education at UC-Riverside, UW-Platteville, or Texas A+M Corpus Christie as you can get at a top tier state or even Ivy University.", "NTA, but can I say your son rocks for initiating the f off convo. I hate the \u201craised them right\u201d trope, but like, it does sound like you raised them right if he\u2019s defending his sister.", "Nta", "Your 16 year old son told an adult to F-off and you defended him?!  ESH!!!  For obvious reasons your son because it doesn't sound like Beth was rude (given the story), but it does sound like she overstepped.  If she is worried about your daughter, that should be spoken about in private with you and she could ask questions.  It's pretty natural to wonder why your daughter isn't excelling and I bet she is tired of being compared to her brother and at this point as given up trying to be like him in any way.  The fact that you've accepted that is a red flag and YTA for not keeping a keener eye on these issues.    \n\n\nThey both need to apologize.  She needs to apologize to your daughter for not understand how she is a very different person from her brother and your son need to apologize for being so disrespectful.", "ESH - you, the sister and son with a potty mouth.", "ESH Your sister needs to mind her own business Your son is mouthy.", "NTA Well done for raising such fantastic kids and supporting them in following their own paths that each chooses. You should be proud of both the twins and well done to Brysen for defending his sister, you have obviously instilled great family values in your kids. \n\nExplain to your family that you support Brysen completely and that he was justified in responding to Beth\u2019s rudeness in kind and you will not endorse her terrible attitude, especially not at the expense to your family. She is the one that should apologise and keep her unwanted opinions to herself!", "ESH. I don\u2019t care if your son was offended, him thinking it is okay at the age of 16 to tell his aunt to f\\*\\*k off(even if she\u2019s wrong) and you defending that kind of behavior tells me there ARE issues with your parenting. Your sister probably was being an elitist prick but your son\u2019s reaction is indefensible, and her asking him to apologize was completely reasonable.", "NTA\n\nI think you are a great mother for standing up for your kids.Not everyone is academically inclined and your daughter has other skills. She is also only 16, she has time to figure out what she wants to do later.\n\nIt is a good thing your sister moved away.", "NTA. While your son was rude I get his frustration and that your sister was the straw that broke the camel back. However you should talk with him about how to handle these kinds of situations. As for what you said to your sister just say I and the kids didn\u2019t want her advice if she doesn\u2019t like our response she should learn the lesson of keeping your opinions to yourself.", "ESH. Your son didn\u2019t need to tell her to fuck off. I understand he\u2019s sick of being compared to his sister and was trying to stand up to her, but he didn\u2019t need to jump straight to swearing at his aunt, whether she was out of line or not. It obviously made matters worse and he needs to learn to be the bigger person.", "No-one swears or loses their temper at a top university???\n\nGive over.", "Bullshit. I went to an \u201celite\u201d school and plenty of us were extremely emotional all the time.", "Nope, some people need to be told to eff off occasionally.  Nowhere in the post does it say the sister is academically challenged, it just says she is more introverted and not athletically inclined.  As a PERSON, she has different interests and goals than her more extroverted and ambitious brother.  Was his response a little extreme?  Yes, but someone who is family but obviously not close to the kids she inserted her judgment into the situation and he responded in a way that people like her can hear.  As the father of twins, I can also tell you it\u2019s the kind of bond that evokes a different kind of response if one or the other is \u201cattacked.\u201d", "He is a 16 year old child, she is a 40 year old adult.

She\u2019s a prick!", "Good on you and good on Brysen too. It\u2019s easy to let that golden child stuff (not saying you are doing that but I\u2019m sure society is like your sister was) go to your head and devalue another sibling in your mind. \n\nI would suggest that having your sister over in the near future would be a very bad idea. \n\nNTA", "I don't think you need to apologize for defending your children and putting a name to your sister's behavior. Your sister essentially told your child she isn't good enough and when your other kid stepped up to defend her, she got nasty. Your sister needs to take a major step back, stop judging your kids and make nice. THEN you'll be nice back to her.", "Beth was sucking up to Brysen at the expense of his sister, and he wasn't having it. OP backed up Brysen...NTA.", "NTA. Besides, not everyone needs a top college degree, and not everyone benefits from that. \n\nI went to a top college, while my brother went to a smaller community college. But now, he\u2019s the one who is getting a PhD while I\u2019m happy with just my degree. Your sister doesn\u2019t get to bully your kids and then act like the victim.", "ESH why is your kid swearing and allowed to offload on someone who obviously doesn't know about the back story of these old talking points. It's obvious from how you tell it, that he went from 0-100 and started a fight. Sure, your sister doesn't know the full situation. But getting into a decent school isn't about elitism. It's about survival in this wasteland of a job market. This just sounds like you feeling insecure about your parenting of your daughter and leaving your poor son to defend his sister because you won't guide this repeated conversation responsibly.", "NTA and good job raising kids that defend eachother.", "NTA. You did good by protecting your kids from unneeded, unwanted and unwarranted judgement.", "Nta - you were nice.  If anyone talks shit about my kids it's gonna get ugly", "Beth is a production-line prick, nothing special, lol...", "NTA. This random internet stranger is cheering Brysen on. That said F off might not have been appropriate but I can\u2019t blame him for using it."]}
