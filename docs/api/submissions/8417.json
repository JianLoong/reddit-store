She's acting so entitled.", "NTA, you are right to set boundaries. I teach kids ranging from 3 to 18 and I'm dead tired of people assuming they have a right to dump their kids' childcare onto me during my free time. They usually say that if I chose this career it means I love children and so I should actually enjoy dealing with their kids. What a load of crap!\nIf this mom needs a break, she has her husband to turn to or has to pay a sitter.", "Yeaahhh NTA. Just because you\u2019re qualified doesn\u2019t mean you have to provide free labour. \n\nThis is like asking a paediatrician friend to diagnose the kid\u2019s illness just cos they happened to come for dinner.", "NTA. Your friend didn't ask you first. She always needs to ask, even if you do childcare. You set your boundaries with her and she should respect that. Don't feel bad for this at all.", "NTA! How incredibly rude and entitled that mother is to attempt to dump her child on you! You're 100% in the clear for politely seeing boundaries with her. \n\nNot your child means not your problem!", "NTA.\n\nI hate people who do this. If you want a break from the baby, find a sitter, period. Inviting someone over under the pretense of visiting and then dumping the kid on them is so very disrespectful and uncouth. It is not your guests job to care for your child. And if you really need a hand while cooking or what not, you ASK, and then bow out gracefully if they say no because it is NOT their job and they have every right to say no.\n\nEdit*tenses\n\nThis also makes me think of how often I get \"SO, you're a nurse.\" ... not right now I'm not! I'm a guest off hours. Most times I answer their question but wow it happens a lot lol", "NTA  but stop visiting at your friends house. It sounds like the primary reason they invite you is to give his wife a break. So if it happens again it's on you.", "NTA for sure and these are usually the type of people that judge women for not wanting kids", "NTA. It seems like it should be common sense to check with someone before handing them an entire human being.", "NTA, hand her a bill next time you get told to watch the kid", "NTA.\n\nMom set the standard here - apparently it's ok to walk over and dump the kid on someone else if you feel like it. You were just following her lead.", "NTA. They didnt ask. If they are that exhausted they need to talk with their partner or a medical professional, maybe both. You are not the long-term answer to their exhaustion.", "NTA. I get being an exhausted new mom, but she should\u2019ve asked. I get needing a break and feeling relief that someone else (who can be trusted with her child and is competent with children) is there to *maybe* help. But she didn\u2019t ask, and you are not obligated to hold someone else\u2019s child regardless of how tired they are.", "NTA. Childcare is your profession, not your hobby. You aren't making business calls, but social calls. She is being extremely rude and presumptuous to dump her kid on you and expect you to provide childcare, free, no less!\n\nIf she needs a break, she should hand the kid over to her husband - he's the kid's parent, too. There's absolutely no good reason for the mom to be watching their kid 24/7.", "NTA. That\u2019s just rude because you work in childcare assuming you will look after the child whenever you are there, I\u2019d stop going round there. Their baby their responsibility not yours.", "NTA. You're allowed to have a social visit without being expected to perform the same services that you perform at your paid job.", "NTA. That is her baby to take care of. She laid down and got pregnant with the baby. She decided to keep the pregnancy and to keep the baby. She is the one who is responsible for the baby. She can relax when her baby goes to bed.", "NTA.\n\nBut your friend is. His wife is clearly exhausted and needs a break, so why doesn\u2019t HE step in?!", "NTA\n\nYour \"friends\" should hire a paid babysitter.", "NTA.... the she doesn't even ask if you'd mind watching the baby just while your friend cooks is just plain rude. Unless they have specifically asked you if you could watch the baby when you come over they shouldn't assume you would. Maybe ask your friend about it though and encourage him to either do more at home (if you think he might not pull his weight) or to make sure his wife is OK and ensure she is getting the help she needs.", "NTA, incredibly based, the mom was rude and that's child neglect on her part.", "NTA. They are parents in the thick of it. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not your problem, but it is hard. Your friend\u2019s wife sounds like she is possibly dealing with some PPD. Your friend is probably a little resentful from having to deal with that (I went off the PPD deep end myself, my husband worked full time and had to pull a lot of household duty to make up for it at the time, I\u2019ve seen it). Tensions are high. She shouldn\u2019t dump the baby on you without asking, at all, but if they truly are your friends and you really want to help (not just make yourself feel better about this particular incident, because totally NTA), maybe offer to watch the baby on your terms on a time that is convenient for you so they can have a night out. If you\u2019re happy to help as long as it is occasional and respectful, try to communicate those boundaries. Maybe they can adjust too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
