I teach kids ranging from 3 to 18 and I'm dead tired of people assuming they have a right to dump their kids' childcare onto me during my free time. They usually say that if I chose this career it means I love children and so I should actually enjoy dealing with their kids. What a load of crap!\nIf this mom needs a break, she has her husband to turn to or has to pay a sitter.", "Yeaahhh NTA. Just because you\u2019re qualified doesn\u2019t mean you have to provide free labour. \n\nThis is like asking a paediatrician friend to diagnose the kid\u2019s illness just cos they happened to come for dinner.", "NTA. Your friend didn't ask you first. She always needs to ask, even if you do childcare. You set your boundaries with her and she should respect that. Don't feel bad for this at all.", "NTA! How incredibly rude and entitled that mother is to attempt to dump her child on you! You're 100% in the clear for politely setting boundaries with her. \n\nNot your child means not your problem!\n\nEdit: typo.", "NTA.\n\nI hate people who do this. If you want a break from the baby, find a sitter, period. Inviting someone over under the pretense of visiting and then dumping the kid on them is so very disrespectful and uncouth. It is not your guests job to care for your child. And if you really need a hand while cooking or what not, you ASK, and then bow out gracefully if they say no because it is NOT their job and they have every right to say no.\n\nEdit*tenses\n\nThis also makes me think of how often I get \"SO, you're a nurse.\" ... not right now I'm not!

I get needing a break and feeling relief that someone else (who can be trusted with her child and is competent with children) is there to *maybe* help.

They are parents in the thick of it. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not your problem, but it is hard. Your friend\u2019s wife sounds like she is possibly dealing with some PPD. Your friend is probably a little resentful from having to deal with that (I went off the PPD deep end myself, my husband worked full time and had to pull a lot of household duty to make up for it at the time, I\u2019ve seen it). Tensions are high. She shouldn\u2019t dump the baby on you without asking, at all, but if they truly are your friends and you really want to help (not just make yourself feel better about this particular incident, because totally NTA), maybe offer to watch the baby on your terms on a time that is convenient for you so they can have a night out.
