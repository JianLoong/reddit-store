I\u2019d rather not say the exact industry or my position but I have two direct reports, including \u201cNadine\u201d (23 F).  We have had a good, professional relationship.\n\nI am meeting my bro tonight to see the new Ant Man movie.  Typically, we would also grab dinner at the sports bar next to the theater, but he can\u2019t get there until shortly before the movie starts.  Because it\u2019s really not convenient for me to go home before the movie, I was planning on eating by myself at the bar.  Pathetic, I guess, but it is what it is.\n\nBy complete coincidence, Nadine lives near the theater and frequently goes to the same bar.  I asked her if she had plans to go the bar tonight, and she said there was about a \u201c33% chance\u201d she actually would be there with some girlfriends, but they weren\u2019t yet sure what bar they were going to go to.\n\nI told her I did not want her to be at the bar during the specific time I was there.  My reasoning is that work is work and life is life and as long as she has other options wouldn\u2019t she rather be in a bar that her boss isn\u2019t in?  It will be awkward and we would have to talk about work.  Candidly, I am somewhat embarrassed that I will be sitting at a bar by myself eating dinner, so I don\u2019t want her there for that reason too (although I did not say this).  And honestly I don\u2019t want to deal with the headache of trying to explain to my wife why I am at a bar with a female colleague and her female friends on one of the only nights I\u2019ve been out of the house since our baby was born.\n\nNadine agreed but I could tell it bothered her.  I didn\u2019t order her not to go, but she needs this job and my dad is the boss so I do acknowledge it would be hard to say no.  I mentioned this to my sister (who also works at the company) and she said I was completely out of line to tell any employee where they can go after work.  Now I\u2019m second guessing myself.  AITA?\n\nEDIT: I get that the consensus seems to be that I am TA, and as much I might want to I know not to protest a judgment here.  I just want to address one issue that has come up.  Due to where this theater is, what time I had to leave and what time the movie started (we bought tickets in advance), there really aren't other places I could eat.  There are a few other places that are kind of close but they don't have the food I eat.  Since she had other options, I just thought it would be good if we didn't go to the same place.  Win/win.  I know this probably wouldn't have changed the judgment and I accept whatever the judgment ultimately is but I wanted to clarify that.", "created_utc": 1676582512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1141h1i/aita_for_telling_my_employee_that_she_cannot_go/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
