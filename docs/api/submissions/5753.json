Your brother is right, the decision to come out belongs to no one but him.

But it is his decision when and with whom to share his identity.", "My condolences.\n\nIt is *entirely* your brother's choice about how he comes out as gay. How that affects your father is mostly up to your father.

You have no way of knowing any of this, or how it will affect anyone but you.\n\nLet your brother be himself. His true self. YTA", "Soft YTA.

That said it's not your decision when your brother comes out, and think about what this will do to your relationship with him when your father is gone.

It's not your choice.", "YTA coming out should be when HE is ready, and not about anyone else. Back off.", "YTA. It's not your place to dictate to your brother what he tells his dad before he dies. If he needs to share that, then he gets to make that choice.  You don't own your father, your assumption this would impact his illness is wild, unscientific speculation, and you're attempting to micromanage your brother's personal relationships. Simply inappropriate on all counts. Butt out.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to decide when your brother comes out, even if it inconveniences you or your family member. If you truly do support him, then support his decision to come out to your father. There's no \"right time\" to do anything, and if he feels like it is the right time, let him have his moment.

If your dad is coming to the end of his time (and I'm sorry you are facing this) there may not be *enough* time to sort things out if his initial reaction is very negative which could mean the final state of their relationship is an awful one - which your brother will have to live with.\n\nBut then , as you say, he's ceased to make homophobic comments it may be he's realised your brother (or you) is gay & has already come to terms with it.\n\nTbh is a horrible situation but it is down to your brother & him alone, but you do need to support one another now more than ever. Good luck to you both.", "YTA..I understand you think your helping and it\u2019s a sensitive situation, but in the end your  brother deserves a chance to tell his father who he really is, if that\u2019s what he wishes to do, and I think your dad also deserves to know his son, for real. Your role would be to provide support.", "YTA. I see that you think you are helping, but your brother being gay will not affect your father\u2019s illness in any way. If you love and support your brother, let him know that, and allow him do things in his own time.", "YTA. This is your brother's decision, not yours. Your decision is to either support him with what he chooses or not.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nI know you are more concerned with your brother's safety, and trying to protect him emotionally. But not only is this not your decision to make, but you are also doing your father a huge disservice.\n\nFrom your own actions, you acknowledge your father's ability to change his opinion. You have already noticed his behaviour change and the decreasing amount of overt homophobia.\n\nYeah I get not wanting your baby brother to be subject to hate or rejection, but by telling him to stay in the closet you are removing his hope for the acceptance & love he deserves to get.\n\nLgbtq kids are ready for the ugliness. We accept its possibilty when we are ready to come out. And if your brother feels ready to take that risk, its because he is ready to deal with the fallout if shit breaks bad. He already has a very good idea of how bad things could be. But he has an older brother who loves and supports him, and right now that means supporting him in this.\n\nSudden shocks are probablu bad for people who have cardiac problems, but a sudden shock is not going to affect your father's prostate cancer. This isnt about your dad's health, this is about you believing your father will react poorly to learning his son is gay.\n\nThing is, as long as your father is alive, he has a chance to prove himself a good father. Maybe he react badly initially, but with declining health and sudden context for all those conversations he's had with his mid about accepting gay people, its likely that he will be able to make it over the mental hurdle and make peace with his gay son. And that literally will never happen if he dies without knowing.\n\nYour brother thinks this might be the only chance he has to have a father who knows him and accepts & loves him as he is. And he knows he might not get that, but to him the potential reward is worth the risk.\n\nLook, maybe your dad is an unrepentant homophobe and a terrible father. But there is a chance he isn't, or that he is willing to learn/change. You shouldn't take the choice away from him. And if your brother is willing to take the risk, you should just try to be supportive. Maybe ask to be there to help defuse the situation, or ask what you can do to soften him up first. And then do what you need to do, to protect your brother. If shit goes bad, keep working on your father to get him to accept gay people. But don't try to keep your brother in the closet just because you don't trust your father to react well.", "Gentle YTA\n\nIt makes sense where you're coming from and what you're trying to protect not only your brother but also your dad from. But no. Your brother coming out will not make your dad worse, and the timeline of his coming out belongs ONLY to him. \n\nHe's right. Support him, but don't try to make his decision for him", "NAH\n\nI can see both sides. You are afraid that your dad will not accept your brother, and that it will cause grief for everyone involved. You brother wants to be accepted by your dad as his authentic self while he still has the chance.\n\nI don't think there is an easy answer here, but ultimately the decision to come out is your brother's, and you should accept and support him whenever he decides the time s right.", "You\u2019re doing your best, but YTA.  Your brother is trying to take responsibility for who he is, and it is very important that he makes this decision for himself.  You can support everyone here, and I think you should.  Talk to your brother; I think gently walking this back and telling him you support him will mean the world.", "YTA it's his choice only", "Normally I would say you\u2019re correct in hiding someone\u2019s orientation to parents but only if there was threat of harm. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case from the post. Your brother wants to be honest with your father and I think he should. I\u2019ve heard numerous stories from LGBTQ folks that their biggest regret was not telling their parents before they died. I wouldn\u2019t hold your brother back. Your dad is going to pass on whether he has this info or not. This isn\u2019t for him, it\u2019s for your brother. Gently, YTA. But you can make this right.", "YTA \n\nFirst I\u2019m very sorry about your dad\u2026 I unfortunately know exactly what you are going through but\u2026 it is your brothers choice and if he doesn\u2019t get to come out to your dad he will regret it and eventually you would regret keeping him from telling him. Plus you never know your dad may surprise you\u2026\n\nMy own dad was not perfect by any means. He made some pretty big mistakes but in the end\u2026 when he was sick\u2026 none of that stuff mattered. What mattered was family and the love we have for one another and all the good memories and good times.", "A gentle YTA. It's clear that you have good intentions and care about your brother's well-being. I imagine this is a very difficult time for you, too. At the same time, your approach takes away from your brother's autonomy.\n\nIt is one thing to encourage your brother to wait to tell your parents until he is an adult / more independent because you know that your dad will react poorly. But it is different when your dad is dying and your brother can't wait any longer. It is likely important to your brother to share this part of who he is with his dad, and he may feel long lasting regret if he never shares who he is with his dad despite wanting to.\n\nFor what it's worth, sometimes terminal illness has a way of changing people's perspective about what is truly important. I certainly hope it does in your dad's case and that your brother feels loved and accepted for who he is. At the same time, be there to support your brother in case the reaction is negative as you anticipate. Ultimately, whether to come out to your dad is your brother's choice to make, and you should support him in whatever decision he makes.", "YTA - I know you\u2019re trying to protect him, but this is HIS decision, not yours.\n\n(Source: was outed by my mom to my uber-conservative extended family without my knowledge.)", "YTA It\u2019s likely that Dad already knows this information. You shouldn\u2019t gatekeeper anything because it has nothing to do with you.", "Yes. YTA. It's none of your business to who or when your brother comes out. And supporting him when he does is something you should do.\n\nThat said, it's understandable to be worried about your father's health; though not so much for your reason. But you should also view it as an opportunity for your brother to Introduce his true self to his father before it becomes an eternal what-if. It was insensitive of you, true. But one of the hardest thing to do is to understand a situation you will never be in. What matters is that you make an effort to.\n\nAsk your brother to tell you why he wants to come out to your father. No judgment, just ask him to help you understand a situation you have no comparison to.", "YTA. When you were trying to protect your brother from your father's homophobia, that was one thing. But now you're trying to protect your father from the consequences of his homophobia, meanwhile potentially taking away your brother's ability to ever come out to your dad, or to have time for your father to repair the relationship if he reacts badly at first. You have no right to interfere with that.", "YTA, he should be allowed to come out whenever he wants to. the trick to getting your dad to be less homophobic might even be that your brother\u2019s gay and he loves him. and if that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s still your brother\u2019s decision to make.", "YTA He doesn\u2019t need your permission to be open with his sexuality", "YTA. It\u2019s your brothers relationship with his father. It\u2019s none of your business to interfere with it, especially if your father doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left.", "Soft YTA. Like others have said, I think your intentions are good. However, this is your brother's decision and right now he needs your unflinching support. When my wife and I were  dating, her mother strongly discouraged her from telling her extended family about me, particularly my wife's grandfather. She used the same excuse you mentioned, that his health was poor and hearing shocking news could kill him. My wife ended up coming out to her other family members, but not him, because she was scared about what her mom had said. And then he died, and my wife never got to share that part of herself with him. She will never know for sure if he would have fully accepted her, though we both think he would have. I know this is something she still regrets. And on top of it, it has been years, but she is still angry at her mother for not supporting her and for talking her out of coming out to him. \n\nSo keep in mind that you're ultimately hurting your brother, your dad, and yourself by not being more supportive. You don't want any resentment poisoning your relationship with your brother, which is likely if your father passes and your brother felt that you had gotten in the way of something this important. It's hard to be caught in the middle, but it's between them, and you can't keep shielding your brother by making him hide who he is.

I'm no doctor but I'm pretty sure it won't affect his illness, but I understand why you would be hesitant considering the fact that you don't want to upset him when he is sick like this, especially since you don't know how long he has left. I also see your brother's side though since he understandably wants to come out to his father before he loses his chance to do so. I don't really think either of you are assholes in this situation, but you should talk about the situation in a civilised way and decide on a course of action like that, rather than just arguing.", "NAH. I understand your concerns but all you can do is advise your brother on what you think is best. Your brother is ultimately the one who decides", "NAH.

I know it's hard to recognize the ingrained homophobia in yourself sometimes, but the idea of \"the shock might kill him!!!\" Is just that, homophobia. Nowhere in this post do you express concern for your brother- no \"I don't want him to get kicked out\" or \"considering comments my father has made in the past I would be concerned for his safety\". Your post is entirely about your father's supposed delicate feelings and making everyone else but your brother comfortable. Heads up dude, your father is a grown ass man who's about to die.

It hurt me that he didn't trust me enough ( I knew from the situation before I ever got the text).\n\nI am still recognizing and squashing homophobic thoughts over a decade later. its not a on/off switch. Nurture can be a hell of a thing to oovercome.The number of people who act like any single thing is a disqualifier really makes those of us doing the work to try and change ourselves wonder if it will ever be enough. And that can be enough to make some stop trying. \n\nImagine trying for years to change your father's perception of what you know is your brother. And then some internet stranger comes along and dismisses it as \"obviously this guy has a lot of work to do\". Ice cold of you. Would freeze a whole pool if your pinkie toe touched it.", "People take surprising news in stride all the time.  It doesn't always imply that hidden bigotries are being smoked out.\n\nThe OP is YTA for pushing his brother a bit too hard.  The latter may just want to let his dad pass on without confronting him, which is perfectly all right IMO.", "Bruh, being momentarily surprised that someone you've known for a long time is gay isn't homophobia. If that was the case, it makes me banging my high school crush VERY confusing.", "What\u2019s revolting is how there\u2019s a fear that this guy might get sicker or die cuz his son is gay.", "Well, maybe, but he goes on the say the shock cod be too big for our dad and it could affect his illness", "Thanks tried to edit it and I messed up.", "Okay, agreed.", "No, your thinly veiled wish of death on another person's dad is revolting. Your comment is sneering, disrespectful & wholly inappropriate.", "The person you are talking about is OPs dying father. Show some fucking empathy.", "Some can\u2019t read correctly", "Where am I wishing death on him?  I\u2019m saying that if having a gay son speeds things up, that\u2019s his own issue.  I fully hope that his son comes out to him and he says \u201cok I love you\u201d", "No. \nI hope that the brother comes out to the dad and the dad says \u201cok I love you\u201d. \nIf it somehow makes his condition worse that is his problem.  That\u2019s not a lack of empathy gtfoh\n\nPeople have really had 15 years to grow the fuck up on this issue at this point, at a minimum.", "No, the dad will be dead it's everybody else's problem. if he gets worse and dies from the brother telling him how do you think that will effect OPs brother?  You think it will be fun for OPs brother thinking that he killed his own dad?

Your only role in this is to support him.", "I see a lot of people saying YTA, but honestly I don\u2019t agree.\nWith the concept of homosexuality out of the argument, it would be pretty selfish for your brother to come out if there is any risk to your fathers life. Doesn\u2019t matter whether the father is an ah or not. Your thinking about your fathers health, while your brother is being self conceited", "NAH. I understand your concern - if your dad isn't accepting then it could potentially be devastating for your brother. He may not be able to spend any more time with his father and he could be completely cut out of the will. \n\nHowever, it's ultimately up to your brother to decide his own fate. You just have to be supportive of his choices. If you're not there for him, it'll just be you and your mom.", "YTA. you don\u2019t get decide when someone wants to come out, ever. Your brother coming out is not going to kill your father. I know you are trying to protect your brother but he\u2019s 17 and he wants to live the rest of the time your father has honestly. You have no right to tell him to continue to lie.", "TTA he should choose when he wants to come out, not you, or when you feel your parents will be ready, he may never be ready, and brother wants to tell him before he dies. You're also the AH for implying that telling your dad could cause his death such bs.", "I have the feeling that you dad already knows or he thinks that you are gay\u2026. (He\u2019s stopped the homophobic comments right?)\n\nIt\u2019s a nice thought that you\u2019ve been protecting your brother from what you were sure was going to be a terrible reaction & I think part of that was you trying to delay the blow up you were sure was coming to the whole family too. \n\nI have to ask if part of you wants to delay the announcement because if your parents react badly, you will have to choose sides & you\u2019re afraid of what that means for you? \n\nBut the thing is, it\u2019s your brother\u2019s life & his decision. Your dad will react how he reacts & you can be there for your brother afterwards.

He just wants the freedom to openly be himself & I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re holding him back from that. \n\nIn all honesty, I think now is the best time to tell your dad, I couldn\u2019t imagine going through the rest of my life not knowing if my father would still have loved me.. that would really make grieving for him very complicated!\n\nWith all my heart I hope that your parents react well, that you & your brother have all the love & support you need & that you & your bro remain close.", "If i could award this I would.

Enabling discrimination is itself discrimination.", "My 3 year old has brain cancer, you think the lord has it out for him too? \n\nThe OP's brother should do whatever feels right, because the dad's condition is going to get worse either way. Cancer doesn't care if the dad is a homophobe, it kills good people as easily as bad.", "Religious AHs always find a way to displace the blame on literally anyone else who isn't them.

However, it's still the descision for the brother to make, he is the only one who can decide what is most important to him.\n\nSo I agree with YTA. Let your brother decide for himself.", "Totally possible but I'm sure the brother realises this. It's up to him whether he wants to take that risk or not, not up to OP to \"let\" him.", "This\nEdit: I agree life is rarely simple. But op YTA", "i don\u2019t think OP is enabling discrimination. he said he\u2019s talked to his dad about stopping his homophobia and it has been working. it\u2019s more the fact he\u2019s trying to protect his younger brother from forms of abuse but also he\u2019s now worried about his father. i agree with a gentle yta", "That'd what happens when your raised in conservative christian home.", "Compassion for dying people is just as important as compassion for LGBT person. \n\nIf my marriage fails and my parent is dying, should I tell them my truth or let them find comfort in dying peacefully that all is well in the world.", "That is clearly not what it\u2019s about, OPs brother wants to show his dad who he truly is before it\u2019s too late.
