You wear them once a year.  Once you're an adult and finished growing, it is entirely reasonable to keep a costume and use it for several years, rather than wasting money/effort on a new one every year.  \n\nRelationships sometimes end, or fade.  You moved fairly far away, your friend now has a new SO.  These things happen.  \n\nYou don't get to make her buy a new costume just because she wore this one last year.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I totally understand how it feels to feel replaced in a friendship. Your feelings are valid and it's ok to feel hurt and miss your friend and how it used to be.  That being said, your feelings are yours and only yours. Costumes are expensive so maybe your friend had that one from last year and it was convenient to reuse with SO. I get in my head a lot about what things like that could mean too, so I get it, but it's important to realize that's all YOU. You can't dictate the usage of a costume. It's good you at least have recognized the source of your feelings (feeling replaced) so can work towards that.\n\nYour comment about her SO wanting her to distance herself from friends is concerning. You can't do anything about it, but keep your door open so she knows she can come to you if she needs it. She could also simply be wrapped up in her SO and dating and all that and it's nothing actually sinister.\n\nFriendships change. Be flexible to the change and it will always be there. Try and force or dictate things to make it conditional and that's when it breaks. If she is truly a close friend, even if you aren't as close as before, she still values you. If she shows that she doesn't, put your energy into new friendships instead of grasping too tightly to this one. \n\nGood luck OP.", "YTA. You aren't the god of Halloween costumes--you can't tell others what to wear. You're in college, so look around and make new friends. That's the best part about college imo.", "INFO: what was the costume?", "I don\u2019t blame you for being upset about losing a friend, and you can feel however you want about the Halloween costume. L is free to make choices about who she spends her time and energy on, and it sounds like she\u2019s choosing her S/O. She is not replacing you, because you were never her S/O. You are/were a friend. She doesn\u2019t owe you her friendship, as difficult as that might be for you. Right now I think NAH, but if you make a big deal about this Halloween costume I think YWBTA.", "YTA, it\u2019s understandable that you feel upset about losing a friend, but for the love of god it is just a Halloween costume. That\u2019s an awfully silly thing to be upset about. And you\u2019re in college not super close to home, so perhaps look at finding a community there. It\u2019s normal to lose some high school friends, especially ones grades behind once you go to college.", "Beetlejuice and Lydia"]}
