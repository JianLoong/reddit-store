Wow, what a sucky thing to do. They basically were like \u201clol we think you\u2019re too uggo to appear on our page like normal\u201d. But apparently you WERE good looking enough for them to accept your money and try and use your likeness without your permission to make more of it. They deserve it.", "NTA\n\nShe's falsely advertising if she's falsifying photos.  Not only that, she asked for permission to post the candid photos,  not super edited ones.  \n\nI never trust a business who is so willing to completely alter a person's face,  especially a small beauty retailer.", "NTA, no.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask others to do it. It was an honest review.\n\nAnd you certainly aren\u2019t in a place to be sued. It\u2019s a really stupid thing to edit things out like that\u2026 unless there\u2019s a good reason to- they had none", "NTA she had no right to edit pictures of you. Its also not your fault it went viral. She was in the wrong and is now getting bad karma for that.\n\nOk so ast year i got married in a fancy hotel that cost $400 a night. It was beautiful but i slipped over 10+ times one being on my wedding night and i hit my head on the toilet in the bathroom. Now why did i slip so many times? they used wall tiles on the floor. AS a niece of a plumber/tiler i can see and feel the difference and even with towels on the floor to try and prevent slipping it still happened. My reviews have gone viral(200k+ views) and i imagine if people are looking at reviews of the place before booking they might think twice about being a patron there. The food also sucked for the price point. The night of my wedding i sent back 3 steaks that they cooked well done (one was burnt) when i asked for medium and my pregnant sister was served undercooked fish twice. Just what a mess and they deserve bad reviews, just like the lass that edited your photos cause you didnt \"fit the vibe\"", "NTA You made an honest statement about your experience, you were not in control of how other people would react. A professional would have reached out to you with an apology  and made a suitable public statement about \"learning to be better\", which would have been all that was needed to save their reputation. Any business these days has to have at least a basic understanding of how social media can affect them and how to deal with such issues in a professional manner.", "NTA! as someone who lives with some thing that has altered my appearance what they did was messed up. I\u2019d be offended too if I was photoshopped like that (unless I\u2019d asked)\n\nWorking in the beauty industry they should know better. They should be making women feel beautiful as they are and promoting all appearances.\n\n\u201cFit the vibe\u201d? What vibe is that the same fake vibe as beauty magazines?\n\nYou posted an honest review and called out their poor behaviour. You didn\u2019t ask for the inundation of fake reviews.That is internet trolls that you can\u2019t control.\n\nI am so sorry that you had to deal with such crap.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, they world now knows what they are really like, and they don\u2019t like it.\n\nAnd getting ppl to come after you like that shows how toxic they really are.", "NTA, \n you talked to them first, and instead of apologizing for something they shouldn't have done in the first place, they doubled down. \nSo you left a bad review and put it on Facebook. It's not your fault that people online will take any excuse to bully someone. \nIf you had a large following, I would maybe say you shouldn't have, but you had no reason to believe it would blow up like it did. \nDo I think people should be leaving fake reviews and actively destroying their lively hood? No, that's too far, but they fucked around and found out. That's not on you.", "NTA. That was shitty of them. Didn't go with \"the vibe\"? Ew. For her to go through the effort of even editing that means she has too much time on her hands.", "NTA and I don't think you can be sued for expressing an opinion based on facts about your own face online.  It's her fault for altering your face to fit some \"vibe\" (whatever the fuck that means)", "NTA. With this whole anti-doxxing culture going on, people think they can do just whatever the hell they want, and you're the bad guy for calling them out on their bullshit, and it's absolutely astonishing how many people will jump to the asshole's defense. \n\nWhat they did what use you to promote their business, and they disrespected the shit out of you in the process. \n\nYou're not going to get sued. The only way they could win that is if they could establish liable/slander, and both of those require you're testimonial to be false. \n\nSpeaking of sueing, did they get consent from you to use your likeness to promote their business? If so, did they offer you fair market model rates? If not, consider your own lawsuit.", "NTA. People are just trying to scare you to take the pictures down. Don't. Those pictures are of you and you have ever right to speak your truth.", "NTA.   I think it was shitty of them to share photos of you **without** showing you what was getting shared. Then to edit them on top of that.  Double AH move by them.", "NTA. That's horrible to make edits like that without your consent. Heck, in this case, it would have been horrible to ask to make those edits.", "Lmao!!! NTA.\n\nQuintessential FAFO. \n\nOr as us olds say, \"Karma's a Bitch\".", "Info: was there discussion around posting the before and after picks with you?\n\nDid that discussion include any statements like touch them up or light editing or any statement which suggested modification?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they want perfect models, they should hire and pay for them, not edit out people's port wine stains or keloids or any other physical traits (and your nose, WTH) they've deemed too unsightly to market their business with. They reaped what they'd sowed, I'm glad you were honest.", "NTA\n\nYou don't deserve to get sued. But the people leaving reviews for a business they've never been a patron to might. IMO, if you've never been a customer of a business, you shouldn't be leaving a review. Everyone can choose whether they do or do not patronize a business and you're welcome to voice that opinion....

The shop definitely should have asked you before posting your photos and mentioned the editing. And should have removed them immediately when you told them that you were unhappy about it. They were unlucky, but it's the consequence of their own actions, not yours.\n\nNote also that using your likeness for advertisement without your agreement is extremely likely to be an infringement of your publicity rights, or of your privacy rights, or both, depending on your juridiction.

You obviously did not specify in what way those images would be used. If you give a business free rein to use your picture, and then they use it in a way you don\u2019t like, you don\u2019t have the right to blast them on social media.  You can reach out, express your disappointment, and then be more careful with your image in future. I\u2019m sure you are a beautiful person, which is why they wanted your image, but if you gave them carte blanche with the photos, then just learn the lesson and move on.", "~ what do you mean undercooked fish?
