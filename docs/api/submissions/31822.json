Not in the sense of \u201cI win, you lose, or you win, I lose\u201d but to better understand where you are coming from. If you need to, consider involving an impartial third party like a mediator or counselor. \n\n**Your list might include:**\n\n- significant time(s) when you will be living with your wife and child as a solo unit, without her parents, because you want to establish a family unit and parenting philosophy all your own\n\n- an agreement that your (two, as the mom and dad) parenting decisions are respected, and a process in place for how you and your wife will resolve conflicts if she (and her parents) are advocating for X and you feel strongly about Y\n\n- an understanding of what your ILs will and won\u2019t do, and what you will and won\u2019t do for them \u2026 for example, maybe they will babysit for X hours but no more than Y a week, so you and your wife can go on dates, work, or spend time on separate hobbies; maybe you will buy them a car to get around but don\u2019t want them to use your car ever and don\u2019t want to chauffeur them if they can\u2019t get a license\n\n**Her list might include:**\n\n- emotional and practical support she can rely on, especially if she feels parenthood duties will fall mostly on her, and if she / you intend for her to continue working\n\n- offloading critical work that\u2019s of value to her, such as cooking healthy meals and / or cooking meals familiar in her culture during a vulnerable time \n\n- bonding time with her parents over a major life event, and solidification of their presence in her new life, since they live out of the country and may be elderly or some day not be in physical shape to travel to be with your child frequently\n\n\nBy exploring these lists openly, you\u2019ll learn more about each other and how to approach this new phase of your life together in the way best for you as a couple. Perhaps you learn that she feels their presence at this stage will be so important emotionally and imprint on your child, and perhaps she will learn that you fear being outnumbered in your own home. A compromise might present itself: can you consider building an addition to your home, say an IL apartment that has its own entrance / exit and kitchen / bath, so you and your wife have defined private space and so do her parents. Maybe you find that you can rent an apartment down the road for them, and thereby preserve your sanctum while also getting them close enough to feel like they are there for your wife. \n\nNever forget that the process of discussing these issues - not just as a means to finding a \u201csolution\u201d quickly or getting each of your own way, but as a way to know each others fears and hopes better - may in of itself bring your closer and make each of you feel more confident that you have each others\u2019 backs, regardless of what comes next.", "ESH.

Is her mom going to critique how you hold your own baby, prevent you from spending time with your baby because she already put him to bed, stop you from cooking your favorite foods because \"the baby doesn't like the smell\" and so on?\n\nThe first year or two of parenting is a big transition for a married couple. It's really hard work, and I can see why your wife would want more help. But at the same time, the extra stress of the baby often also generates more arguments between the couple. You and your wife would never be able to argue with each other about a marital topic without having an audience, and more importantly, her parents would likely be on her side. It's not good for either spouse to feel outnumbered in their own marriage. I think it could really drive a wedge between you and your wife and make you feel like a mere guest in your own home. \n\nI think the finance issue is somewhat the tiebreaker.

Being forced to leave her job to accommodate the points above. This is a big one - some women do not want to stay at home and having a job gives them purpose and bolsters their self-identity. To rob them of this would be unfathomable. \n\nShe is arranging for insurance by way of her parents.

Only tell if asked \ud83d\ude02", "Per OP:\n> Currently we both do as little household labor as possible!\n\n>She does the majority of the labor, but I manage all of our finances, bills etc.\n\n>I don't game until late, I only gave it as an example of random things that the in laws pass comments on. Baby will obviously be top priority for me.\n\n> I am pretty useless when it comes to chores at the moment. I do need to learn to cook\n\n> I manage all of our legals, financials, bills etc. Which is my main contribution to the household responsibilties. Machines do most of our house chores. She does more than me, but it's not significantly more.\n\nEdit: to add an extra comment", "I manage all of our legals, financials, bills etc. Which is my main contribution to the household responsibilties.\nMachines do most of our house chores. She does more than me, but it's not significantly more.", "Thank you :)", "When dads don't make plans in heterosexual relationships, it's moms who cope and adjust while dads fuck around. This _is_ her coping and adjusting to the realization that OP isn't going to be any goddamn help and isn't even considering other childcare options. And it's better to do that now than to try to do it with a fucking newborn in the house.", "I mean, that's great. OP's plan is to work while also caring full time for an infant. And also he's never even babysat before, doesn't do any housework, and doesn't know how to make any food.", "I had to pay a babysitter. When I got off work, I picked up my kids I went home I took care of them. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else living in my house.", "Well we'll get whatever help the other billion parents on earth get. We haven't got financial stress.", "And the wife is worried about washing the dishes, so far they can\u2019t even afford a dishwasher.", "Right ? The further down I go, the more I\u2019m on team \u201cInlaws move in permanently\u201d. This bloke hasn\u2019t got a clue, and isn\u2019t going to try.", "I'm rich enough and money isn't a problem, what do u want me to say!", "Yeah, that sounds like a horrendous time, as well as interesting at the border patrol. Border officers love seeing retirees spend their maximum 6 months, and then try to go back again less than a year later for the whole 6 months. \n\nI\u2019m 7 months pregnant, with two munchkins at home, and my mom is visiting for a month specifically to help with the older two. Try to get your wife into some parenting and infant classes. I don\u2019t care what the culture is, the older generation will want to go against medical advice because of what they did decades ago, and you two need to have your stuff figured out.  \n\nAlso, if you have the funds, get a housekeeper to come in once in a while. We meal/freezer prep like maniacs the months leading up to the our births so that we have easy, healthy meals ready to bake. Babies are exhausting, but it\u2019s one baby and two of you. You can step up around the house, especially if baby\u2019s breastfed because your wife will absolutely be exhausted and recovering. It\u2019s not easy, by any means, but it\u2019s absolutely possible.", "This sounds awful. I would have paid money to have people leave my house when I had a newborn. This is a lot, definitely NTA. \n\nDoes you wife have medical needs or something that require full time help? Is it a cultural expectation? And if you have more kids is 2 years going to turn into 5?", "You both are clearly not ready to be parents.", "What an uninformed perspective. Maybe he should read a book or speak to someone who has encountered a newborn before.", "Huh, I missed that.", "You are about the most negative type of person ever. Do you know how many people work from home and still take care of their children? There are many of them. That\u2019s why they do it.", "You absolutely cannot work from home and care for an infant at the same time, unless your job requires no actual work and your infant is the easiest baby ever. Have you ever even cared for a baby?", "It can be really hard to find daycare/nanny services. There can be years long wait lists in the US. You need to figure this out now if you plan to have professional child care.", "Are there machines in the UK that haven\u2019t reached North America yet? I\u2019d love a machine to clean my kitchen, stack my dishes, unload the dishwasher, scrub my floors and toilets, clean my bathroom mirrors, organize my kids clothes, buy and unload my groceries, strip my bed, fold my clothes, you get the picture? Machines don\u2019t do any of the above. Humans do. And your wife is likely doing all of that, while you \u201cmanage your Legals and bills\u201d. Yet you both work. It sounds like your wife has the job of a stay at home wife while also having to work. And you facilitate the paying of bills. That you\u2019re both technically paying. :/", "I'm starting to understand why she wants her parents to live with her. YTA - and an unhelpful, unsupportive asshole.", "If she's the cook, she's doing that three times a day. Do you need to pay bills three times a day, every single day?\n\nThat's even before cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, etc.\n\nYou clearly have an unrealistic view of the workload that needs to be done, which means it's all going to end up on her. No wonder she wants help with that - it's because she knows you won't help at all.", "How do you know all of this do you live there?", "OP isn't planning to pay a babysitter. He currently does zero housework and refuses to cook, and thinks he's going to work full time with an infant at home with no childcare.", "A lot of them get their parents to live with them or live very nearby to provide childcare.", "As previously mentioned:\n\n> Have you started looking at daycare centers? Interviewing nannies? Applying for an au pair service? Almost all childcare for infants has 9+ month waiting list", "If you\u2019re \u201crich enough\u201d you should/would be able to afford bi-weekly housekeepers no? Perhaps that and a meal service could help ease the burden of her parents leaving earlier\u2026.", "Then rent a house nearby for your in-laws to live in, so they can provide the childcare your wife wants without living with you. If you're that rich, that's the solution.", "Maybe your parents, but not everyone's. My parents are incredibly helpful, and look things up themselves to see what the best evidence/advice is, even now when my kids are older. Idk, I'm just tired of people assuming their shitty parents are everyone's shitty parents, bc they're the ones that get posted about online. There are plenty of adults' parents who aren't assholes, so you never hear about them.", "NCT classes in England. Quite possibly the same in other parts of the UK. \n\nA cleaner once a week is not overly expensive, since OP had said they aren't worried about money.", "He's never cared for a newborn before. And he thinks that managing the entire household isn't hard for her because it's mostly done by \"machines.\" Like his wife is a robot maid.", "Depends on the work. If he's mostly async and really flexible, maybe.\n\nBut if he has meetings and scheduled obligations, no, you can't take of an infant (at least not well).", "It's in his comments.", "How do you know all of that?", "My mom\u2019s a fricken saint who\u2019s been there for all of my births- including my stillborn daughter.   My MIL is a narcissistic, bible-thumping antivaxxer from hell though. \n\nHowever, the fact that there are monetized accounts on social media who are popular for either 1)  helping people deal with their parents, or 2) making videos, as grandparents, FOR grandparents in order to help them understand boundaries and how healthy relationships with parents make for a healthy relationship with the grandkids; shows that this is a common theme. OP has already stated that he thinks the in-laws and his parents would be overbearing and too much.", "And that's why his wife wants her parents to stay...", "You\u2019ve twisted his words and inserted them into multiple threads. Is there a reason you\u2019re so negative?", "It's in his comments.", "Sorry about your MIL, but kudos to your mom! I wish we heard more about people like your mom and mine so people aren't scared that their own parents will turn into nightmares, tho. There are def shitty parents, but I don't know if they're as commonplace as this sub and others would have us believe", "Nowhere in his comments, does it say he doesn\u2019t cook the dishes or anything else?"]}
