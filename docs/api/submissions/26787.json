Last Thanksgiving Mark invited his parents to visit for \"a few days.\" They announced they were coming for 11 days. Per our usual cycle, I complained to Mark who did nothing to stop ILs. During the visit MIL said to my then-infant son \"Harry\" when I was in the bathroom  \"Harry, I'm really your grandma despite what people are saying.\" Mark was shocked and told me.

That being said, if they aren't respecting the boundaries then they need to be ignored for awhile. If they come to the door keep the house locked down and do not open the door, etc. \n\nAs someone who has had to do this, it's fucking hard, but they will just keep on stomping over your boundaries if you don't. That's a fair choice for oneself, but it would cause a large strain on majority of relationships. I will say that I would not stay in a relationship with someone who isn't willing to set down boundaries, and that was part of the reason why I knew that it was time to set hard boundaries.", "For me it\u2019s more that people are so unforgiving to the husband. His parents are his parents. They treated him this way his entire life. He was abused/groomed to accept this as normal and if he doesn\u2019t have a lot of very supportive friends or OP\u2019s family, the prospect of cutting off his parents is probably really scary if it\u2019s occurred to him at all.", "I don't disagree with you at all, and I certainly can relate with the feeling of wrongness at cutting off your own parents, even though mine aren't the healthiest parents and my life would definitely be less stressful if I cut them off. But yeah, I love them and so I end up walking a balance between loving them and holding up strong boundaries.\n\nThe one thing though, and why I don't cut him as much slack, is because while you don't choose your parents and you end up having to \"deal with them\" best you can, you *do* choose your spouse and to have a kid (most of the time, at least). To me, that means that you HAVE to find it in you to enforce the boundaries necessary to protect your chosen family. The husband may be trying, but based on the same information we are all working off of, it doesn't seem to me that he is."]}
