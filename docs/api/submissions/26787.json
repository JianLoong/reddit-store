For context, since we've been together my ILs have routinely visited us (we live in a different state) uninvited. When Mark tells his parents \"just come for a couple days because Cathy and I are working/busy, etc,\" they will come for 2+ weeks. When they're here, they expect to be entertained nonstop. MIL makes constant snarky comments and is a narcissist and FIL has anger control issues. Last Thanksgiving Mark invited his parents to visit for \"a few days.\" They announced they were coming for 11 days. Per our usual cycle, I complained to Mark who did nothing to stop ILs. During the visit MIL said to my then-infant son \"Harry\" when I was in the bathroom  \"Harry, I'm really your grandma despite what people are saying.\" Mark was shocked and told me. I blew up 16 years worth of anger at MIL and asked her and FIL to leave. \n\nIn January of this year, MIL is carping to Mark about me and he tells her that if she and FIL don't start being nicer and listening to us, they won't be seeing Harry very often. FIL calls Mark back raging about grandparents rights and how they're going to sue us for visitation and if that doesn't work they'll sue for custody of Harry. FIL said he'd use the fact that Mark and I see therapists as grounds for being unfit. This was the absolute final straw for me. I'm done with these people. Mark has accepted his dad's lame non-apology but I want no relationship with ILs. I have not blocked Mark and Harry from speaking with them or visiting them. \n\nIt's our year to spend Christmas with ILs. They booked a house rental for a month in a town a couple hours away. Mark and I want Harry to spend Christmas day in his own home and invited ILs to come over for the day. If they want to spend the night in our town they need to get a hotel. ILs have exploded over this at Mark. Mark thinks it would just be easier to let ILs have their way. I say absolutely not, and screw these people.
