That says that this is more about him than actually helping you.

You should tell him that it's just a routine procedure that you are glad is happening, and that you aren't anxious about it.", "NAH - you're not the asshole for wanting to look after your children without having an additional person to look after. But equally your FIL is not an asshole for wanting to comfort and be there for your toddler. It sounds like he doesn't want to be helpful and supportive but it's simply misplaced. Maybe invite him to come down once the surgery is over for a day to spend time with your toddler instead of during when you are super busy. Or communicate to him that you need a hand since toddler is in hospital and can he do these specific things to help out e.g get the kids a drink/ go grab some food.", "NTA\nThis is not the time to entertain  relatives,  it's the time to put your child ahead of everyone else.", "NTA, ask if he can visit another time once kiddo is recovered and more able to enjoy his company.

You might talk to your husband about your concerns and see if you can come up with a solution- whether that\u2019s him staying home and visiting later, or him visiting but maybe he has an \u201cassignment\u201d I.e. take your other kids out for ice cream so Mom can focus on 1.5yo, etc. Maybe he needs explicit directions on how to help.

At the end of the day, as long as you don't have to manage it, that will be helpful. \n\nIt sounds like he's worried and wants to be there.

It was exhausting and mentally draining and there wasn't anyone who could help because he only wanted mommy or daddy. If I was expected to entertain anyone I would have hissed at them like an angry, touched out cat.
