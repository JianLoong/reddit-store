I have been planning a retirement party for her for about a month, it's coming up this Saturday.  It's not a surprise party, she's been included in the planning.  I was able to book a private room at her favorite local restaurant and the guest list is just local family members, less than 20 people.  Mostly aunts and uncles of mine, but a few cousins as well.\n\nMy dad's brother and his wife were at the bottom of my invite list because they aren't anyone's favorite people.  But I also didn't want to just exclude them since every other local family member is invited.  Last week I extended them an invite and they accepted.  Within 48 hours, I was already regretting it.  \n\nFirst, my aunt texted me that her husband called my dad at midnight to ask questions about the dinner, but my dad couldn't answer them.  Which, of course he couldn't, he's not the one planning it.  Then, she asked if their 19-year-old daughter, Steph, could come since she wasn't included on the invite.  I told her I didn't know Steph was back in the area since she attends college across the country.  But my aunt told me she would be back the week of the party and she should be included since other cousins are too.  Ok, fine, adding one more to the guest list isn't the end of the world.  \n\nThe next day, she texted me again asking if we can switch the venue to a different location because the one I picked isn't handicap accessible.  Steph is in a wheelchair and the restaurant we picked is in a 100+ year old building that doesn't have a ramp, only stairs.  My aunt said that she and my uncle have been to that restaurant before and it's too cramped for Steph to get around.  \n\nI told her that it's a little late in the game to switch venues, especially since this restaurant was one my mom specifically picked out.  I told her we could probably have some people help lift Steph up the stairs and once we get her inside, we could figure out the rest.  \n\nShe said that would be humiliating for Steph and that we should switch the venue to a more accessible one so that we aren't singling anyone out or putting anyone in a humiliating situation.  She said I should have planned better to make sure the venue is accessible for everyone.  \n\nAt that point, I told her that I am not going to change the venue and that the party is going to go ahead exactly as planned.  I told her if she and her family don't feel they can attend for whatever reason, we would miss them, but we would understand.  \n\nShe has since gone on a crusade, contacting nearly every family member she can, trying to convince them to talk to me about changing the venue for Steph.  I've been bombarded with calls and texts since.  \n\nI finally sent out an email to everyone telling them that the venue will NOT be changed and that the party is going ahead as planned.  I've gotten mixed reactions from a lot of family and I'm wondering if I did the wrong thing.", "created_utc": 1686078348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142q42n/aita_for_not_switching_venues_for_my_moms/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made a reasonable suggestion for accommodating her at the venue your mom chose. Whatever your aunt does in her spare time is her issue. I feel bad for Steph.", "Omg I am in a wheelchair part time and if anyone was doing this drama behind my back and I found out about it I would die of embarrassment. Timeline:\n\n1. You booked the party at the favourite restaurant of the person the party is for, taking into consideration the needs of the people you were inviting.\n\n2. You sucked it up and invited your worst relatives, even though everyone would rather they sank into a bog, and told them you were going to Restaurant A. \n\n3. Your relatives have previously been to Restaurant A and know it is not easy to get around for their daughter WHO YOU DIDN'T INVITE. Despite this...\n\n4. Your aunt informs you that actually your cousin will be back from the college she attends on the other side of the country, presumably to minimise embarrassment, and would like to come. You very kindly agree.\n\n5. Your aunt then demands that the entire party be rearranged because the daughter who wasn't invited can't get in easily. You say you will sort out carrying her if necessary (btw, this was a horrifying suggestion, omg I cannot even. Eep. No one's insurance covers that and my level of ick with being picked up is HIGH. However, this might be a me thing so I'm giving you a pass.) \n\n6. Aunt goes nuclear and calls Everyone to complain.  \n\nI'm going NTA, but I think you need to get contact information for your cousin from somewhere and find out if she even knows what is going on. Because if I was dropped into this situation at a retirement party for my aunt I would expire from embarrassment, and I am A LOT older and less shockable than I was at 19.", "NTA, you didn't plan for needing an accessable location because Steph was not on the invite list. This is not about anyone but your mom and she wanted this location. (ETA: I can see why Steph is going to school on the other side of the country.)", "NTA\n\nAt least where I'm from there are usually accessibility aids in a lot of restaurants if they aren't inherently accessible (portable ramps or something similar) but finding that out should probably be on them to call and find out in this case imo, since you were not aware she would be coming when the event was initially planned. You picked a very meaningful location for the event and it's quite rude of someone to ask an entire event to be moved purely for that. Not exactly the same, but my family had a similar issue when my sister was on crutches after knee surgery, but we just missed the big event and scheduled something smaller on a seperate date. \n\nThere is no reason for someone to bug the entire family about a problem that doesn't concern the whole family. I see it so often here and it drives me nuts lol\n\nAs an aside, has anyone asked if Steph even wanted to come? I know personally the last thing I'd want to do upon returning from university is go out to food with my entire local family all at once lol.", "Tell her lf she wants to plan another party that meets ALL of her requirements at her own expense you would love to attend. Apologize for being unaware her daughter was back in town and suggest she makes sure to keep the family updated when she is back in town in the future so everyone knows to include her in any family get togethers.  If she is on Facebook that is the perfect place to put it. Shut her and her complaints down publicly.", "NTA. If your mom requested that venue, then it's up to people deciding whether they want to come, no matter how valid the reasoning is for not coming. Your mom gets the venue she wants on her birthday, and people can plan around it if they want to be there", "NTA.  You offered to work with Steph, they won't accept, that's on them.  My only question is whether or not you've actually spoken directly to Steph about the situation.  She's 19, I'd do her the courtesy of no longer letting her overbearing mom gatekeep communications and invitations.  It wouldn't be surprising at all to find out that Steph is fine with the accommodations you've suggested, only to be bulldozed by Hagatha.", "The things that gets me is that Steph\u2019s access wasn\u2019t the FIRST thing brought up by aunt and uncle, it was the third. Presumably they received the invite which had the venue name. Their first move was to request/demand an invite for their daughter KNOWING the venue. THEN, uncle calls his brother to inquire about food options? Still not addressing Steph\u2019s access. Finally they bring up her access and state they have been there and it won\u2019t work. Ok, why didn\u2019t this get brought up in either of the first two instances? Seems odd and like they just want to meddle. NTA for keeping to the venue and plan especially this late in the game", "NTA stick to your guns. Tell your aunt that when she plans a gathering she can choose venues. Ignore her and tell everyone you\u2019ll see them there! Then ignore any emails or texts.", "NTA. It's not just any venue; it's your mother's favorite restaurant. Asking for a change at this late date can't be accommodated easily; you may not even be able to book another place. \n\nYou offered the solution of carrying your relative inside. I have seen this happen at other venues that are older and don't have accessible entry, and it hasn't seemed to be that big of a deal; people work together to get the person inside. But your relative doesn't want to do that.\n\nIt's too bad that not everybody can attend every party, but that's what happens sometimes.", "NTA. 1. You didnt even invited her, they more or less did. 2. This is your moms retirement and it should be about HER and this is a place she loves. 3. It\u2019s really late in the game to change a venue for this many people and again, you never invited her to begin with, you were basically coerced into it. 4. You did the best you could offering an option with the short notice hour were given.", "NTA - Maybe speak to Steph directly and explain the situation to her and see what her take is on it because God knows what your aunt has said and I can see how it might be a bit upsetting for her if the story has been told in a particular light.", "INFO: What does your mom think should happen? The party is for her after all.", "NTA - You gave her an option that someone could carry Steph if needed and she said no. This is your mom\u2019s party and your mom\u2019s favorite restaurant. \n\nINFO: doesnt the ADA require that everywhere be wheelchair accessible now? (Assuming you\u2019re in the US)", "NTA", "NTA. Wait who's Steph again?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... /s", "No good deed goes unpunished.  It would be easier to give this aunt the benefit of the doubt if she weren\u2019t going around, complaining about OP to the extended family and essentially hijacking and ruining the nice event to celebrate her sister/SIL\u2019s retirement\u2026. for the benefit of the person that she invited to the guest list\u2026 and has rejected accommodations for as they would limit the enjoyment for her invited guest\u2026. \n\nShe\u2019d rather ruin the event for the person of honor.", "NTA. It's absolutely unreasonable to ask people to change the venue of their event! It's your moms party. She wants it at this specific restaurant. Done.", "NTA - Have a great time at the party!", "NTA", "NTA, but this is very tricky. It seems to me like this is mainly a function of the late add on invitation.\n\nOn the one hand, you can invite or not invite anyone you want to a party, and so these relatives seem a little presumptuous to be demanding inviting their daughter themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, they don\u2019t necessarily know how long the planning has been in process and are probably assuming that they are equal guests with everybody else, not realizing that you don\u2019t necessarily even want them there very much at all. And unless you\u2019ve told them that the planning actually started a long time ago, they probably are assuming that this is a relatively recent idea with the location recently decided. So I don\u2019t think they are totally out of line for hoping that you would make it accessible to the guests and relatives equally and not functionally discriminate against a disabled one. Of course, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re directly doing, and your reticence is mainly a function of the last minute changes.\n\nBut presumably , if you had included these family members from the beginning, there would have been time to adjust to make it wheelchair accessible. I think this was unwise planning /inconsistent guest-listing on your part, but I am going to go with NTA since you have clearly tried to do right by people and I think your aunt is out of line for blowing up everybody\u2019s phones and taking you to war over this.\n\nI do wonder if you could defuse her sense of entitlement and control over the event by simply coming clean and admitting that you weren\u2019t originally planning to invite them at all? Would that make it better or worse?", "NTA. But ADA requires accessibility. Have you asked the restaurant directly what their accommodations are? By law, they must have them. Maybe you just missed something. \n\nYou could always backpeddle and say your deposit isn't refundable but if they'd like to pay you for it, you can switch the venue. They won't but then they can't say you didn't make an effort.", "If you're in the US, there has to be some kind of accessibility for people using mobility aids. You could double check with the restaurant (if you felt like it lol).\n\nI'm going with NTA, mainly bc you didn't know Steph was coming until after you'd done most of the planning. In general, I advocate for accessibility for everyone, but I also understand your planning didn't need to include that until after the fact.\n\nINFO: Does Steph even *know* about all this shit? Or is your aunt being a total tool for no good reason? I mean, you said Steph just got back from college. It's possible her mom is being unreasonable but Steph herself wouldn't be.", "NTA", "ITT: a bunch of people who think being technically correct is the most important thing.\n\nHere's what really matters, OP - regardless of anything else, your actions will ensure your family always sees you as the jerk who punched down on a disabled girl and will extend that judgment to your family. This is a stupid hill to die on but hey, it's your family. If you want your party at the restaurant you have every right to do so, but don't weep about the consequences.", "ESH. Feels like you\u2019re the shutting down the option because you don\u2019t like these people as much as because of your mom\u2019s preference.

Nuclear option.", "NTA, you already planned the venue and that's the venue your mother wanted. It's her day, not anyone else's day. It might be different if you'd known your cousin would be there, but this is last minute. Since the drama people are causing trouble, I'd uninvite them now. It's bs that your father was getting calls at midnight. They're making your mother's retirement celebration all about them.", "NTA... You didn't invite Steph to the party, so it was not designed to accomidate her.

As shitty as it might, you might need to just take the fall on this one if you want your mom to keep peace with her siblings and niblings though.\n\nYour auntie\u2019s only advantage in this situation is laying hard on the guilt of how her DISABLED daughter is cruelly excluded from a family event.  Hence why some of your relatives (especially those big on \u201cfamily\u201d or are easily influenced) are backing her up.  She\u2019s really taking away the focus that this event is not a family event.  It\u2019s a celebration of your mom\u2019s retirement.\n\nAnother option is keep the venue, invite your mom\u2019s friends, close family and close colleagues instead\u2026 and plan something smaller for family who aren\u2019t supportive of your decision (only if your mom cares to celebrate with them).", "Like I said in the post, that couple is not high on anyone's list of favorite people.", "I have three of them and them being like this was one of the three reasons I went NC with them", "I like your idea of a separate get-together.", "This!

I hate it when people want to be difficult on your behalf. There are things we want to fight for, when we should have an expectation of accomidation. However it can be embarrassing when people get involved on your behalf about something that is not reasonable. It is not a reasonable expectation to have accomidation for an event that you were not originally invited to and that is a private event.", "Getting picked up when people think you can't get around is the most mortifying thing, and I'm not even in a chair!

She really likes this restaurant and is looking forward to having her party there.  But she also doesn't want to exclude anyone and feels bad about Steph and the lack of accessibility.  We tried looking into different options, but pretty much all of them would require rescheduling or doing something other than my mom's preference.", "Not necessarily in this case. Only part of the restaurant has to be accessible to count. They are not required to have every area of the restaurant be accessible. Edited to add: Some businesses may also be eligible for a waiver if the building is of historic significance.", "Seems kind of mean to bash on Stef when it\u2019s her parents who are being difficult, and if anything, it sounds like Stef has been pretty isolated from the extended family because of the extended family not wanting to deal with her parents \u2014 kinda sad in that regard maybe.", "Very often old buildings may not have had permanent access fitted, but may have portable ramps etc.  Sometimes there is a lift for supplies etc. and while that might not be the most elegant of solutions it might help a bit?", "You're right, but this location is over 100+ years old and sometimes the ADA rules won't apply to them because of the cost of retrofitting and potentional damage done to historic buildings.", "If it is a historic location, and they simply CAN NOT make the necessary chanfges, they would be fine without accessability.", "No, they will see him as someone who didn\u2019t upend all the plans for someone who wasn\u2019t even invited originally.", "Nailed it.

The only reason we were able to open it as a bar was because we also had a small bar downstairs.

Well, I've seen a sign that says call this number- what else could it mean?)\n\n(though I did google it and a building like OP is talking about would have some exceptions.)", "The ADA does not have a blanket exception for historic buildings.\n\nSome local building codes have limits on what remodeling can be done in buildings with certain historic status.\n\nHowever, federal law generally trumps state/local law.  (Which is why cannabis remains illegal, even in states that have legalized it within their borders.)\n\nBuilding owners will often use the fact that the building is \"historic\" as an excuse to avoid the expenses of complying with the ADA. Particularly since modifications that are compatible with the historic nature of the building are more expensive than updating a modern building, or just building in the accessibility from the start.  They'll pull this even if the state hasn't certified the building as \"historic\" and even if there are no actual restrictions on what they are allowed to do in order to comply with the law.  They just don't want to bother, and find this an excuse many will fall for.\n\nThere are a few variations in the law for government-certified historic buildings.  But they do require at least one accessible entrance, and one accessible toilet, although it may not have to be the main entrance.  \"Tough luck, no handicapped patrons allowed\" is not an option.\n\nOther things, such as the fact that the dining area is crowded and awkward for someone in a wheelchair, is purely a matter of the choice of the owners or operators.  You do not have to have so many tables as to make it that crowded, and you do not have to arrange them in such a way that it is difficult to move around.\n\nCall the owner, explain that one of the guests of your party uses a wheelchair, and ask specifically ***how*** patrons in wheelchairs access their facilities.\n\nDo not ask ***if*** it can be done.  It is legally required, speak to them as if you assume they have followed the law, ask how it is done.  You may need to use a back or side entrance, or they may have a portable ramp they can set up.\n\nParticularly for restaurants, they almost always have ramps into their kitchen, to make deliveries easier.  Cutting through the kitchen isn't ideal, but it would allow your cousin to attend.\n\nYou would be AH just to accept the second-hand claim from your aunt and uncle that the facility is inaccessible and exempt from the ADA.  They don't sound like good advocates for your cousin's needs.\n\nCall the venue, be firm that this is what you, as a customer, need, and that \"no\" is not an answer that you will just accept.\n\n[https://www.structuremag.org/?p=7540](https://www.structuremag.org/?p=7540)\n\nOh - record your call, if you can.  Your cousin can decide to sue, if she chooses to attend, shows up, and is denied entry.  The only enforcement mechanism for the ADA is disabled individuals suing when people don't comply, so doing so is a civic virtue, enforcing a necessary law in the way intended by the law, not some kind of nuisance suit.\n\nETA:\n\nIf the Genesee Country Village & Museum can make their historic buildings accessible, ***anyone*** can.  My sympathies for people saying they can't fix a historic building are very, very, very limited.

If you know someone who uses a wheelchair you can ONLY go to accessible restaurants in the off chance they will be visiting from across the country and possibly have another guest invite them to go to the restaurant with you? Duh!!! /s", "yeah which is why its on the restaraunt as being abelist not the mom", "I would definitely reach out to them directly to ask about the accessibility of the room. Even historic building have requirements on this kind of thing. That being said NTA for not switching venues.", "I mean, she\u2019s OP\u2019s cousin and the Mom\u2019s niece so that doesn\u2019t seem totally tangential for a  big gathering of extended family members. (though in the comments, OP he doesn\u2019t seem to know her at all, so it seems there is a larger story about that whole unit of the family not really being welcome at stuff. It is not clear whether Stef is as difficult as her parents, or is just unknown because she was relational collateral of bad relations with her parents or something)", "It's insane. I think some of the compliance rules need to be thought thru again, especially in respect to old buildings.", "I'm laughing at the visual of someone being lowered in by helicopter, waving at the crowd from their chair \ud83d\ude06", "I also worked in 100+ year old buildings. One was an old church with steep stone stairs up front. Out of sight we did have a ramp in the back that was wheelchair accessible, too bad the hallway it connected to was too small to turn a wheelchair in. So someone COULD get INTO the building but they couldn't move out of the entranceway. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You know what would be a legitimate problem?  Trying to change literally everything about the party less than 5 days before it's scheduled.  I'm not a party planner.  I'm not an event coordinator.

This is supposed to be a fun, happy retirement party for my mom.  I'm not about to engage on some crusade against historical buildings and their ADA compliance.  I don't have time or energy for that.  I just want to celebrate my mom's retirement.  I'm not here to do a deep dive into ADA compliance.", "To be fair, this restaurant has been in this building for nearly 50 years.  My knowledge of ADA laws isn't the best, but didn't that come in the 90s?", "Oh please.  the building is 100+ years old, many of them are not handicap accessible. They didn't CHOOSE to make the building not accessible.  \n\nAt least where we live in the US, it is perfectly legal for a restaurant to have inaccessible areas as long as the same service are available in an accessible area. Many private party rooms are in that inaccessible area (like, upstairs in a building with no elevator)", "the building is historic - very likely not possible to make the necessary changes.", ">OP he doesn\u2019t seem to know her at all\n\nShe's 20-years younger than me.  I had graduated college and started my life by the time she was in preschool.  So yeah, we're not close.  We're at totally different stages in life.", "Yeah... who knows. In any case, OP should probably ask Mom her opinion or talk to Steph about the stairs, etc.  Haven't read all the comments, not sure if this was touched on.", "I\u2019m not saying they haven\u2019t put you in a tough position but why even post here if you\u2019re so convinced you\u2019re not doing anything wrong?", "On your end, it is ***one call*** to the restaurant, to find out exactly how they comply with the law, so you can pass that information on to your cousin.  One call should not be overwhelming. \n\nI included the background information so that you don't fall for the lies used by businesses choosing not to comply with the law.  I've even had businesses claim that they were \"grandfathered in\" because the building they use was built before the ADA passed, in the 1990s!  \n\nIt should actually be fairly straightforward to sort out, unless they're choosing to deliberately and illegally exclude disabled people.  I've been to restaurants that looked inaccessible, but if you called and asked, they'd tell you to either send someone in to the the reception desk, or call when you arrived, and they'd bring out a portable ramp.  Any restaurant with the common sense not to deliberately exclude paying customers will have some sort of means for customers who use wheelchairs to come in and spend their money.", "yes they did NOT chose a handicap accessible venue when they selected the building that they would run their restaraunt out of, so cleaarly they care more about the location than being open to the public  mabey it is tradition mabey they did not consider it when selecting the building but .  \n\n\nBecause that resatraunt is in that building and that building is allowed to break the ADA  \n\n\nthe owners of the restaraunt are 100% being ableist by not moving to a building that can be updated, or already IS updated to allow for everyone to attend.  \n\n\nuntill then it is an exclusive club with the only bar to membership being they do not allow for people in wheel chairs (possibly more but wheelchairs are the context in this situation)  \n\n\nmom is fine for selectnig the restraunt, and aunt is okay for asking to change it due to the different accomodations.  \n\n\nand NO is a perfectly fine reply to being asked to change the venue", "No problem, OP. You\u2019re not obligated to be close with so your cousins. Obviously if this was a birthday party for you, she\u2019d not make the cut. The only reason they/she are even relevant is because you\u2019re framing this party for your mom as a large extended family gathering.", "So should we just demolish all the historic buildings?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> it is an exclusive club with the only bar to membership being they do not allow for people in wheel chairs\n\nSpare me.  Businesses do not have to be 100% ADA accessible in historic buildings as long as the same services are provided in both the accessible and non accessible areas.  The main dining room is most likely ADA accessible, so no, they are not excluding people with disabilities", " Nope. Wanting to be in a historic building instead of some new, bland place isn\u2019t ableist."]}
