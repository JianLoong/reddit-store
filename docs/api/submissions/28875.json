{"id": 28875, "submission_id": "1779pr4", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend's boyfriend that he isn't invited to \"girls' night\"?", "selftext": "A bit of background first. My friend group and I all live in the same city that I grew up in. Most of us went to college together in the city, which is where we all met. I moved a state away after graduating college, but recently moved back and reconnected with everyone. Since moving, the group has expanded and branched out a whole lot, which I love because it's been so easy to make new friends.\n\nNow, I'm a huge fan of girls' nights. I just love them and all the positive energy, and me or one of our other friends like to host them every few weeks. I'm hosting one tonight, and I sent out a reminder text to all the girls about it this morning. \n\nA few hours later, I got a text from my best friend Sophie's boyfriend. I'll call him Brad (fake name). He went to college with us, but he and I weren't really that close until he and Sophie started dating. He asked me why he wasn't invited to the party tonight. I told him that it wasn't a party, just a casual get-together. It's going to be the most stereotypical \"girls' night in\" (painting our nails and watching a rom-com) and he wouldn't want to come anyway. He said it hurt his feelings that he wasn't invited, and he thought that I should have invited everyone and done something more inclusionary, like watching a Marvel movie. I said that wasn't the point of a girls' night. He said girls' nights were sexist, and that I was being hypocritical because my roommate, James, a high school friend of mine, was going to be there. \n\nI had to go, so I ended the conversation there, but I told him that I wasn't changing my mind. But then later I got several texts from him and a couple of the other guys, saying it wasn't fair that we were hanging out without them, and that they had always felt left out and not really part of the group because we were always doing things without them. \n\nI texted Brad back and told him that it was my apartment, it was ridiculous to expect me to invite everyone to everything, and that if he wanted to be invited to things so badly, there was nothing stopping him and the other boys from doing \"boys' nights\". He called me an asshole and a bad friend, and implied that I'd \"ruined\" the friend group by coming back. \n\nNow I'm really mad, but also confused. James is supporting me (he says he believes in the power of girls' nights) but says I was a little bit of an asshole about it, and should have addressed Brad's feelings more instead of shutting him down so immediately. Now I feel bad, but I'm also confused as to why the boys are all upset about not being invited to girl's nights now, when we've been doing them since college. It's also just not practical to invite 20-30 people to every single thing. But there's a lot of people who I've only met since moving back, and maybe the dynamics have shifted since then.\n\nAm I wrong? Do I need to apologize? It's a little too late to change plans for tonight, but should I try to organize something for everyone?", "created_utc": 1697233755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1779pr4/aita_for_telling_my_best_friends_boyfriend_that/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe find a time for all of you to go out together a couple of times a month, so no one feels left out, but if these nights for you are a tradition, you shouldn't have to break or alter them.", "NTA if he wants to host a friends night with everyone he is welcome to. You are hosting a girls night. He doesn\u2019t get to dictate what you do in your own home.", "NTA I get why he feels that way, it must mean that you are fun and he wishes he could be included more. But it\u2019s really weird that he doesn\u2019t organize a guy\u2019s night\u2026my husband barely has any friends but he still goes for a beer with his coworkers now and then. I\u2019m wondering\u2026is he lazy and doesn\u2019t want to have to put forth any effort to organize something? Does he just want you to do all of the work for him to have a fun night? It feels a bit controlling too, like y\u2019all made plans to watch a chick flick and paint your nails and he\u2019s upset you don\u2019t turn it into a regular evening with super hero movies?", "This is not really confusing, he can deal with his feelings as he should. Your male friends are bit strange. NTA", "NTA a girls night is just different than a notmal get-together. But i wonder if he has strange fantasies about what you do like gossip about him/the bf, doing dirty things with James or whatever he sees in porn.\n\nIt is normal that the women do things together and the men to things together. \n\nAnother thought....maybe he is overall controlling and doesn't want her going out without him.", "NTA. You are offering to host girl\u2019s night, because you are a specific subset of the friend group interested in doing things that the others don\u2019t like. He (or any of the other people) are welcome to host guy\u2019s night, or alternative activities) at the same time or at any time, and to choose to do whatever they want.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like he wants you to do the organizing, planning, and hosting tasks for him so he can enjoy a gathering rather than doing it himself. How often does he plan anything?", "NTA he wants to push his way in, probably insecure. He lives on planet earth and he knows perfectly well what a girls night is and that it isnt sexist. He just wants to be with his gf 24/7", "NTA, and it's rude to demand an invitation to anything, particularly a girl's night.", "NTA and wow y\u2019all can\u2019t have ONE night to yourselves?? It\u2019s pathetic he\u2019s making such a big deal about it, super wrong he accused you of being sexist, and it\u2019s a big red flag that he\u2019s throwing such a fit. I hope your friend dumps him because things like this tend to just escalate and get worse as time goes on. ETA you might want to actually go out together because I have a feeling he might just show up at your place anyway.", "NTA. Women deserve space to be with and bond with other women without men in that space. Tell Brad he will understand after he grows up.", "NTA and his suggestion for a change of plans in addition to his inclusion is exactly why. I won\u2019t say he\u2019s a bad guy because I don\u2019t get the impression he is but he should respect your get together and not attempt to include himself.", "I struggle to see how watching Marvel is inclusive.  Brad should host a boy's night and invite James, if he is so concerned. NTA Enjoy your evening!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s okay to have a girls or boys night or some of the friend group to do things not everyone enjoys. James is there because that\u2019s his house and as you said, nothing is stopping Brac from making his own plans. \n\nAlso, if everyone else is excited about a fun night in with a romcom and Brad isn\u2019t interested in those plans then changing them won\u2019t be inclusive, it will be catering to one person to make it Brad-friendly. \n\nFor whatever reason he\u2019s trying force his way into your friend\u2019s plans and you are not in the wrong for shutting that down.", "Nta at all but have you talked to your friend, what does she have to say? Why isn't she telling her bf to back off? What do the rest of the girls say?", "NTA.  You are not responsible for a grown mans feelings.  He\u2019s behaving like a brat.  An entitled brat.  continue to have your girls night and he can kick rocks.", "Ha that\u2019s so wild to me.  I fucking love girls night as a husband.  It is husband eats an edible, orders shitty food and plays video games night.  \n\nNTA.  I can see a sorta double standard and if genders were reversed and women were excluded from a guys night because they were told they wouldn\u2019t like watching a sports game and drinking beer that it could be insulting so maybe I\u2019m missing something but most people want their partners to have fun.", "NTA. This reminds me of a situation in my friend group. Most of my friends are guys that I met in high school through my boyfriend (now my husband). Anyway they have been doing guys night out once a week for years. And they don't do much- dinner, desert, drive around to talk, kinda boring stuff but its so they all can get together and hang like we did in high school. I don't go on guys night, I never did and I'm good with it. It's a night I have to myself to do whatever I want. And I've hung out with all of them before on other occasions just not on their designated guys night. Cue the girlfriends (now wives) of the guys (who also don't seem to realize I'm not  a girlfriend or wife\" to them. I'm part of the core friend group for literally 20+ years). One of the girlfriends started complaining about boys night and wanted to go to boys night with them. She riled up the other wives (who never complained before) and they wanted to go to guys night. The girl tried to get me on their side and I was like nooo. I told them I like having my night to myself and I had no interest in going on boys night and count me out of their crusade. They were on it for weeks until it fizzled out. My feeling is that they are jealous of guys night and wanted to \"watch\" their men. I wanted no part of it and steered clear of it.", "the only thing i can think of is he is woried that with the girls night out  the girls are getting drunk going out and hooking up. it could be his inceurites. i say nta", "NTA. Pretty sure your male friends are gay", "YTA if every night is girls night. He can come for the dance, but has to leave after immediately.", "If he wants to go don\u2019t stop him, your best friend would probably take his side and if she doesn\u2019t that will make him more angry. I don\u2019t see what the problem with not inviting him is aside from you not wanting him there. The best thing is to invite him and just have fun, no need to make this tense and this ruin the fun you want to have.", "I don't know...does he think he's a she?", "NTA because you call this girl's night but it's not just girls? Some guy will be there for some reason? \n\nThe boyfriend sounds insecure and controlling, and you shouldn't have to say anything to him, it should be left up to his girlfriend! Next time don't reply at all\n\nEdited YTA to NTA after additional info\n\nLeave the drama to your friend and her man.

Even I know that!", "NTA. For every other friend going to be there, you\u2019re protecting the integrity of the girls night by telling him no. I hate it when that one friend always has to bring her bf, and if this guy is already throwing a tantrum about not being allowed over he would definitely ruin the evening for everyone else. I actually would be really irritated if my friends bf texted me directly about this, I\u2019d throw it back to my friend and have her handle it. Especially if he\u2019s someone who has only re-entered your social circle because he\u2019s dating her. A Marvel movie? Hell, no, dude. It\u2019s Hocus Pocus season.", "No. Don\u2019t apologize. Just understand that if they have a guys night it should be held in the same regard. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. There is nothing wrong with women\u2019s spaces, or men\u2019s .", "Check in on his girlfriend.", "NTA, but Brad certainly is. He is afraid that if the girls all get together, his gf might talk to her friends about him. I'll bet she has a lot to say....", "NTA.\n\nI think, from the outside, having a \"no boys allowed! (Except for this one boy, because he looks very polite)\" social event seems to be cutting half of the friend group out of no reason, just because they're boys.  The people you're excluding are understandably annoyed by this.\n\nI think you would have had more standing about the overall validity of the event in the eyes of the dudes if you stuck to \"We're doing a bunch of activities I know you don't like, and so I didn't see the point in inviting you. No, we're not going to change the schedule, because we LIKE these activities. That's why we're doing them together.\"\n\nAs someone who has been to girls' nights, I agree with you that they're important. (Super duper important if one of the people present is in a shitty relationship. Like, having that space to be yourself and just watch a fucking movie without being belittled about it being a romcom. UGHHH.) \n\nHonestly, I think you should discuss it at the girls night. Your friends will be able to tell you more about the group's current vibe and what the event schedule is like. You can also ask and see if your friends want more girls' nights, and if there might be a better way to frame them (manicure movie night? Romcom icecream party?).\n\nI DO think you should throw a Mojo Dojo Casa House party in the near future, where you all wear sunglasses and do bicep curls while watching Rocky and eating hot wings.", "No one is stopping ANY of them from making plans. They can have a party at THEIR place that THEY host. This is a girls night. They weren't invited. End of discussion. NTA", "Oh for heaven's sake!  Brad is deeply wounded that he isn't included in girls' night in?  And he thinks you're sexist because how dare a bunch of females friends get together and do their nails without him?  And all the guys?  \n\nBecause you're obligated to include him and engage in activities he'd enjoy whenever you socialize in a group!!!!\n\nSeriously?\n\nDon't apologize.  Don't change your girls' night plans.  Don't give it another thought.  \n\nIf Brad whines further, tell him you don't want to talk about it.  Or perhaps he could console himself with a Marvel movie?\n\nNTA", "I thought this was really weird, too. Now that I think about it, he nor the other guys ever really initiate hangouts or anything--they're just default invited to most things. Makes me even more annoyed that he's expecting to be invited to everything.", "Trust me. You don't want him going out on guys' nights\n\nYou'll never be spending time with him again", "My guess is never.", "That's the thing, not even close to every night is girl's night. It's very much a \"once in a while\" kind of activity.", ">If he wants to go don\u2019t stop him, your best friend would probably take his side and if she doesn\u2019t that will make him more angry. \n\nWhy should they change their plans to cater to his feelings while he doesn\u2019t respect their wishes?\n\n> I don\u2019t see what the problem with not inviting him is aside from you not wanting him there. \n\nInviting him changes the vibe of the night. OP and her friends want to do girly stuff like paint nails and watch chick flicks. He doesn\u2019t want to participate in those activities and suggested changing their plans to other activities he would enjoy. That would be like OP planning a trip to Disneyland with a group of Disney nerds and then the guy inviting himself on the trip and wanting them to go to Universal instead because he likes Jurassic Park. Could they possibly do both if time allows? Maybe, but it would take time away from the initial planned activity in order to cater to someone who wasn\u2019t invited in the first place. There will be other future hangouts with activities he\u2019ll enjoy. He doesn\u2019t need to hijack their girls night. \n\n> The best thing is to invite him and just have fun, no need to make this tense and this ruin the fun you want to have. \n\nHis presence will ruin the fun they want to have because he doesn\u2019t want to participate in the planned activities. If they invite him and proceed as planned without taking his suggestions into account, he\u2019d just sulk in a corner and put a damper on their night.", "The guy lives there. She can't kick him out!", "This was typical in my friend group in my twenties, too. The women did all the planning and the men expected to be invited to everything but would complain and moan if it wasn\u2019t up to their standards or something they wanted to do. There was a big fight when some of the guys tried to take over our Buffy series finale party to watch a basketball game. I didn\u2019t know the term \u201cemotional labor\u201d then but that\u2019s exactly what they were expecting of us - to do all the work of maintaining the friend group so they could just show up and have fun.", "People didn't get my Barbie reference...", "Yes, yes, I got that. The problem is it might be awkward and less fun but it\u2019s better than risking being at each other\u2019s throats. It\u2019s happened to me and I never like having \u201cthat one person\u201d around but I try to ignore them", "Hell to the naw. You don't mess with Buffy time. Did you get to watch the finale?", "No people got it, it was just a wasted comment because it has zero relevance in this post."]}
