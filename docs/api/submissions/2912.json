By the time I was 17 I was already addicted to heroin.\n\nFor the following 4 years they did their best to get me clean, but I would get back into the habit as soon as I was out of rehab. When I stole Gran's wedding China and they were unable to get it back, my whole family cut me off.\n\nA year and some months later, I quit on my own. I had help from an organization, but I was finally able to get clean. I was also homeless. I tried contacting my family, one part to apologize and make amends, and one part because I was hoping to move back in. As a homeless person it was harder to stay sober. They told me to never contact them again.\n\nA couple months later, I was contacted by my great uncle while at work. He is not a good person: racist, white supremacist, antisemitic, homophobic... Basically, if you are not a white straight Christian, you are garbage to him. The whole family cut him off before I was even born. He was sick, they gave him 2 years to live. He wanted the warmth of family. No one else would talk with him. I was desperate so I moved in with him.\n\nWhen I moved in I had my 1 month chip, and he may have been an awful human being, but he helped me to stay sober. I have my 5 years chip now, and am a sponsor myself. He paid for me to take some college courses, then paid for a pastry school too. He passed way almost 2 years ago.\n\nOver the last 5 years, I have tried to contact my family many times, but they maintained that they wanted nothing to do with me. I hunted down a China set like the one I stole, then drove to give it back. My mom slammed the door on my face. It hurt, but I get it.\n\nAnyways, my uncle left me a house, an apartment building and a respectable amount of money. After taxes and all that, I cut a check of $60k for my parents (how much they paid for rehab, and some more too), sent it by lawyer. That was a year ago.\n\nNow some family members (not my parents nor my siblings), came looking for me to share the money our uncle left to the *family*.\n\nWhen I refused, they told me that they shouldn't even have had to ask me, that I should've shared it with them, as their due and also as a form of apology for what I put them through.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669069730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1cexy/aita_for_not_sharing_inheritance_money_with_the/", "score": 2741, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't care about you. Go live your best life.", "NTA. They already told you to not contact them again. You obliged because of your negative past. Now they are wanting to contact you again? They can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA, they didn't owe it to you to take you in and you don't owe it to them to share your inheritance.

I'm so sorry your family doesn't reciprocate your attempts at reconnecting but you don't have to keep punishing yourself by trying to reconnect. It sounds like it just causes you hurt and disappointment. Maybe they'll come around some day and you can all move on but for now I would suggest allowing yourself to let it go.", "NTA .\n\nYou don't have to pay them back for them doing the bare minimum while you were going along a bumpy, steep path and then completely cut you off. They made their stance clear. You even offered to return what you stole and make amends but you still got the door literally shut in your face.\n\nThen, you get into contact with an uncle, who although isn't a good person just wanted some comfort in his last years. You gave him that familiar comfort, and kindness as a family member. Even though you were in a desperate situation at the time. That man helped to get you off that steep path and helps straighten you out. Still, none of the family got into contact with you.\n\nThen, once he dies, and rightfully gives everything in his name to you for the kindness you showed him, people who cut the both of you off suddenly tell you to pay up when they only did the bare minimum? Are you kidding me? Get out of here with that. Whatever he left in your name is rightfully yours, nobody else's. And you don't owe them jack.\n\nRecovery is especially hard. Becoming sober takes a long time and it sounds like your family wasn't able to understand that in the first place. You owe them not a single coin out of your pockets.\n\nEdit:You even paid your parents for the costs of rehab as well? Man, you're no asshole. You paid what you owed already.", "IMO, if you stole from anyone else in the family you should repay the cash value of whatever it was you stole. You should be thorough. And an addict of 4+ years most definitely stole more than a set of china.\n\nOther than that? No you shouldn't have to share. He was a piece of trash, but you were the one that was kind to him so you are the one who should benefit from that kindness. You should make good on all the thefts, first, though.\n\nAnd congratulations on 5 years. That is admirable.", "NTA.\n\nYou can\u2019t undo what you\u2019ve done, but you\u2019ve made an attempt to do the best you can to make things as right as they can be. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019d have no use for you without the money.

Addicts tend to have very narcissistic behavior with zero regard to those around them. You don't just get over that quickly. I'm betting there is a reason nobody in his immediate family has come around looking for money. No amount of money can heal that type of damage.

I could respect it if your family was guarded in trying to restart a relationship, but in fact it sounds like they have pretty much written you out of the family.

All that aside, congratulations on the sobriety. It\u2019s not easy, and everyday is a struggle. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re walking in tall cotton now. You have a house, you have an apartment building, and you have a career. Which is an AMAZING start, and to keep going. Like Winston Churchill said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what the relatives that are demanding inheritance money mean exactly? What is it they are entitled to??? Not a DAMN thing. You have done a complete 180 on your life, and you don\u2019t need negativity in your life. Especially with being fragile.

Of course NTA", "NTA  Don't give them a dime.  Keep the money for your future.  You will need it.\n\nVery well done for getting off drugs. That is wonderful. I really hope you can have a good life with people that accept and care about you.  Also it was so wonderful how you made amends by replacing the material things involved. You have tried your best to say sorry\n\nMaybe you hurt your family badly but their reaction when you have recovered, asked for forgiveness and tried to make amends, is hard to understand. \n\nThat some of them (good that it's not your immediate family)  now come demanding YOUR money shows their character and they really do NOT deserve it.

Not to the family.", "I'm gonna say you paid back the money for rehab so square is fair. Remember addiction is a disease, do not continue to blame yourself for being addicted to one of the most addictive substances out there. I'd wonder what drove you to heroin in the first place. Be kind to yourself, otherwise you could slip again. Yes your family clearly went through hell and may not want to risk having you in their lives again. Paying them your inheritance will not change their minds, they are trying to guilt you out of greed.", "NTA. They turned their back. You were in active addiction then , and made your apologies and tried to and no one cared til you had money. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT YOU DID IN ACTIVE ADDICTION YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

So, you could even say you TRIED to share by bringing replacement china (to get door slammed in your face). \n\nFrankly, i\\`d say use what he left you to improve your life. Maybe sell the real estate and move to somewhere new - out of reach of them - and leave no forwarding address.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell done on staying sober - and hey - as bad as uncle might have been - saving you was a good deed.

I literally wiped my Dad's ass the last couple of years and took care of him so he didn't have to die in a nursing home. Nobody helped me even when I asked. \n\nHe did not have much when he passed but of course he left what he had to me. The siblings on his side said they were fine with that but honestly we had NO relationship at that point and I wasn't into faking one anymore. \n\nI commend OP for being that generous considering but no he wasn't obligated at all. You can't ignore someone for years then come to them with your hand out and expect them to just give you what you want. \n\nIt's a sad fact that my own family doesn't give a f- about me. They never have, probably never will. They knew I was homeless and never once broke silence to see if I was okay. Not even with a pandemic going on. Most of them haven't really tried to communicate with me since Dad died and as far as they know I could be dead. \n\nThey have my email. They've never reached out to even see if I am still alive and that despite knowing what happened to me and that I have major health issues. \n\nIt hurt being treated like I was no relation for years. The only thing I was ever good for apparently was taking care of Dad, something they didn't want to do. \n\nI don't hate them but I don't love them either and that's okay.

I also understand them for not having your uncle in their lives, but you benefited and keep benefiting from giving him a chance, which is something they didn't want to do.
