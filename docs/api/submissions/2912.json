By the time I was 17 I was already addicted to heroin.\n\nFor the following 4 years they did their best to get me clean, but I would get back into the habit as soon as I was out of rehab. When I stole Gran's wedding China and they were unable to get it back, my whole family cut me off.\n\nA year and some months later, I quit on my own. I had help from an organization, but I was finally able to get clean. I was also homeless. I tried contacting my family, one part to apologize and make amends, and one part because I was hoping to move back in. As a homeless person it was harder to stay sober. They told me to never contact them again.\n\nA couple months later, I was contacted by my great uncle while at work. He is not a good person: racist, white supremacist, antisemitic, homophobic... Basically, if you are not a white straight Christian, you are garbage to him. The whole family cut him off before I was even born. He was sick, they gave him 2 years to live. He wanted the warmth of family. No one else would talk with him. I was desperate so I moved in with him.\n\nWhen I moved in I had my 1 month chip, and he may have been an awful human being, but he helped me to stay sober. I have my 5 years chip now, and am a sponsor myself. He paid for me to take some college courses, then paid for a pastry school too. He passed way almost 2 years ago.\n\nOver the last 5 years, I have tried to contact my family many times, but they maintained that they wanted nothing to do with me. I hunted down a China set like the one I stole, then drove to give it back. My mom slammed the door on my face. It hurt, but I get it.\n\nAnyways, my uncle left me a house, an apartment building and a respectable amount of money. After taxes and all that, I cut a check of $60k for my parents (how much they paid for rehab, and some more too), sent it by lawyer. That was a year ago.\n\nNow some family members (not my parents nor my siblings), came looking for me to share the money our uncle left to the *family*.\n\nWhen I refused, they told me that they shouldn't even have had to ask me, that I should've shared it with them, as their due and also as a form of apology for what I put them through.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669069730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1cexy/aita_for_not_sharing_inheritance_money_with_the/", "score": 1213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't care about you. Go live your best life.", "NTA. They already told you to not contact them again. You obliged because of your negative past. Now they are wanting to contact you again? They can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA, they didn't owe it to you to take you in and you don't owe it to them to share your inheritance.

I'm so sorry your family doesn't reciprocate your attempts at reconnecting but you don't have to keep punishing yourself by trying to reconnect. It sounds like it just causes you hurt and disappointment. Maybe they'll come around some day and you can all move on but for now I would suggest allowing yourself to let it go.", "NTA .\n\nYou don't have to pay them back for them doing the bare minimum while you were going along a bumpy, steep path and then completely cut you off. They made their stance clear. You even offered to return what you stole and make amends but you still got the door literally shut in your face.\n\nThen, you get into contact with an uncle, who although isn't a good person just wanted some comfort in his last years. You gave him that familiar comfort, and kindness as a family member. Even though you were in a desperate situation at the time. That man helped to get you off that steep path and helps straighten you out. Still, none of the family got into contact with you.\n\nThen, once he dies, and rightfully gives everything in his name to you for the kindness you showed him, people who cut the both of you off suddenly tell you to pay up when they only did the bare minimum? Are you kidding me? Get out of here with that. Whatever he left in your name is rightfully yours, nobody else's. And you don't owe them jack.\n\nRecovery is especially hard. Becoming sober takes a long time and it sounds like your family wasn't able to understand that in the first place. You owe them not a single coin out of your pockets.\n\nEdit:You even paid your parents for the costs of rehab as well? Man, you're no asshole. You paid what you owed already.", "IMO, if you stole from anyone else in the family you should repay the cash value of whatever it was you stole. You should be thorough. And an addict of 4+ years most definitely stole more than a set of china.\n\nOther than that? No you shouldn't have to share. He was a piece of trash, but you were the one that was kind to him so you are the one who should benefit from that kindness. You should make good on all the thefts, first, though.\n\nAnd congratulations on 5 years. That is admirable.", "NTA.\n\nYou can\u2019t undo what you\u2019ve done, but you\u2019ve made an attempt to do the best you can to make things as right as they can be. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019d have no use for you without the money.

You have no idea what damage an addict can cause to those around them, especially to the immediate family who love them most. Stealing is the least of it... You cannot blame his family for not jumping at the chance at welcoming him back home after years of lying, theft and abuse. Addicts tend to have very narcissistic behavior with zero regard to those around them. You don't just get over that quickly. I'm betting there is a reason nobody in his immediate family has come around looking for money. No amount of money can heal that type of damage.

I could respect it if your family was guarded in trying to restart a relationship, but in fact it sounds like they have pretty much written you out of the family.

We all make mistakes, some bigger than others, but it sounds like you have turned your life around and tried to make amends to those you have hurt in the past. That is truly all that you can do.

My younger nephew was not so lucky\u2026my other sister found him OD\u2019ed in his bedroom 5 years ago on July 4th. I wish you continued health and success in you sobriety journey. Your uncle may have not been the best person but he came into your life and supported you when you really needed it. I\u2019m so sorry your immediate family can\u2019t find it in their hearts to forgive you. My sister stole so much from us during her decade or so as an addict but all we wanted was for her to get clean. Maybe one day they will change their minds. Until then do not let the other family members make you feel guilty. If your uncle wanted \u201cthe family\u201d to enjoy his money he would have shared it with more than just you.  I am sure he must have called at least a few of them before you when he found out he was terminally ill but you were the one who accepted his help and provided him companionship during his last days.", "He wanted you to have it, so it is yours.\n\nLook, maybe he wasn't the best person, but he took you in. You were there for him when no one else was. Just as he was for you. \n\nHe appreciated you and wanted you to have his estate, not as payment,  but because he cared about you.\n\nPaying back your parents was a good thing to do. Giving people who cut both of you off money, because they are family.  No. They get nothing", "Sounds like you two formed a very special relationship. I\u2019m sure you meant the world to him.   If he wanted other family members to have money, he would\u2019ve left them some. He didn\u2019t.  Please don\u2019t reward them for the way they treated both of you over the years.  \n\nGiving them some of your inheritance won\u2019t make them accept you or love you more.  Think of it almost like a celebrity \u2014 you\u2019d constantly be wondering \u201chm, are they hanging around more because they need more money again? Or do they genuinely want to spend time with me?\u201d \u2026 that sounds awful. \n\nFamily gets ugly when it comes to inheritance, & they\u2019re showing their true colors.  5 years sober is an incredible accomplishment (congratulations!!) & you\u2019ve already proved that you\u2019ve turned a page", "NTA\n\nYour uncle and you were exiled from the family. The 2 of you became your own family. I'm sorry for your loss of him. No one deserves one cent of what he left for you. It is yours and only yours.", "Tried to return a set of china that looked similar to but was *not* Granny's heirloom wedding china.\n\nThe intention was good but let's not pretend OP was returning the original set.", "Still got a door slammed on his face when trying to make amends. good enough intentions.", "He was at least trying to make amends and was met with refusal. That's their decision. They turned their backs on him time and time again. That's also their decision. OP cleaned up and educated himself by extending a caring relationship to another ostracized member of the family. That was his decision. Now that OP has been rewarded for caring, they suddenly decide he's family? Greed and entitlement should be met with the same distain they showed OP. NTA", "As I said, the intention was good. But saying OP tried to \"return **the china\"** is inaccurate & disingenuous.\n\nThere's an added layer of complexity because it was a family heirloom that was stolen. OP did not, and cannot, attempt to return \"the china\". They attempted to return a similar set to try and make amends - with good intentions. \n\nBut there is no way to get the original heirloom back.", "It's almost as though I was responding to a specific comment in a thread, which made a specific claim.\n\n>**The intention was good** but let's not pretend OP was returning the original set.", "Totally agree. I might add, OP took more than just heirloom china. I would hazard a guess that the reason why OPs family refused the china set is not simply because you can't just \"replace\" a beloved heirloom, but because he also took their trust, and there's no replacing that. I also suspect OPs family saw the replacement china and 60K cheque as a bribe - \"I know I put you through hell, broke your hearts, lied, used drugs and stole from you, but here's a cheque and some china to make it all better. We good?\"  I'm sure OP didn't intend it that way, but sadly that's probably how the family perceived it. Sometimes hurts are too deep and the chasm too wide to ever go back again.", "It's almost as tho I was responding to the judgemental tone of that last sentence. Which came through loud and clear. \n\n-- \"The intention was good, *but let's not pretend OP was returning THE ORIGINAL set* \"\n\nNow tell me that's not what you meant without telling me that's what you meant.", "I'm literally responding to the guy who claimed OP tried to return \"the china\" - the *original, heirloom* china - and had the door slammed in their face. By OP's own account, that's not what happened.\n\nThat's what I mean by \"let's not pretend OP was returning the original set\". Because that's what the comment *I replied to* was doing.", "It was already stated that it was too late to get back the set that belonged to his grandmother so he found a set that was comparable in value. So yup. It is what it is. At least he tried which is more than some would have done. *shrugs*", "Do you know what homelessness is?", "Yeah, I don't think you're reading anything I'm saying. You seem to have decided I made a judgement on OP & are mad at me for that? \n\nI've said multiple times that's not what I said, and even explained it in the last comment. So I'm just gonna paste my reply to you from the beginning rather than endure this circle.\n\n>It's almost as though I was **responding to a specific comment in a thread**, which made a specific claim.", "No, I understand. Which is why I was kinda confused because it was already stated the original set was gone. Cycle ends here."]}
