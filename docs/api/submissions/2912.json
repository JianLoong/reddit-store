By the time I was 17 I was already addicted to heroin.\n\nFor the following 4 years they did their best to get me clean, but I would get back into the habit as soon as I was out of rehab. When I stole Gran's wedding China and they were unable to get it back, my whole family cut me off.\n\nA year and some months later, I quit on my own. I had help from an organization, but I was finally able to get clean. I was also homeless. I tried contacting my family, one part to apologize and make amends, and one part because I was hoping to move back in. As a homeless person it was harder to stay sober. They told me to never contact them again.\n\nA couple months later, I was contacted by my great uncle while at work. He is not a good person: racist, white supremacist, antisemitic, homophobic... Basically, if you are not a white straight Christian, you are garbage to him. The whole family cut him off before I was even born. He was sick, they gave him 2 years to live. He wanted the warmth of family. No one else would talk with him. I was desperate so I moved in with him.\n\nWhen I moved in I had my 1 month chip, and he may have been an awful human being, but he helped me to stay sober. I have my 5 years chip now, and am a sponsor myself. He paid for me to take some college courses, then paid for a pastry school too. He passed way almost 2 years ago.\n\nOver the last 5 years, I have tried to contact my family many times, but they maintained that they wanted nothing to do with me. I hunted down a China set like the one I stole, then drove to give it back. My mom slammed the door on my face. It hurt, but I get it.\n\nAnyways, my uncle left me a house, an apartment building and a respectable amount of money. After taxes and all that, I cut a check of $60k for my parents (how much they paid for rehab, and some more too), sent it by lawyer. That was a year ago.\n\nNow some family members (not my parents nor my siblings), came looking for me to share the money our uncle left to the *family*.\n\nWhen I refused, they told me that they shouldn't even have had to ask me, that I should've shared it with them, as their due and also as a form of apology for what I put them through.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669069730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1cexy/aita_for_not_sharing_inheritance_money_with_the/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't care about you. Go live your best life.", "NTA. They already told you to not contact them again. You obliged because of your negative past. Now they are wanting to contact you again? They can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA, they didn't owe it to you to take you in and you don't owe it to them to share your inheritance.

I'm so sorry your family doesn't reciprocate your attempts at reconnecting but you don't have to keep punishing yourself by trying to reconnect. It sounds like it just causes you hurt and disappointment. Maybe they'll come around some day and you can all move on but for now I would suggest allowing yourself to let it go.", "NTA .\n\nYou don't have to pay them back for them doing the bare minimum while you were going along a bumpy, steep path and then completely cut you off. They made their stance clear. You even offered to return what you stole and make amends but you still got the door literally shut in your face.\n\nThen, you get into contact with an uncle, who although isn't a good person just wanted some comfort in his last years. You gave him that familiar comfort, and kindness as a family member. Even though you were in a desperate situation at the time. That man helped to get you off that steep path and helps straighten you out. Still, none of the family got into contact with you.\n\nThen, once he dies, and rightfully gives everything in his name to you for the kindness you showed him, people who cut the both of you off suddenly tell you to pay up when they only did the bare minimum? Are you kidding me? Get out of here with that. Whatever he left in your name is rightfully yours, nobody else's. And you don't owe them jack.\n\nRecovery is especially hard. Becoming sober takes a long time and it sounds like your family wasn't able to understand that in the first place. You owe them not a single coin out of your pockets.\n\nEdit:You even paid your parents for the costs of rehab as well? Man, you're no asshole. You paid what you owed already.", "IMO, if you stole from anyone else in the family you should repay the cash value of whatever it was you stole. You should be thorough. And an addict of 4+ years most definitely stole more than a set of china.\n\nOther than that? No you shouldn't have to share. He was a piece of trash, but you were the one that was kind to him so you are the one who should benefit from that kindness. You should make good on all the thefts, first, though.\n\nAnd congratulations on 5 years. That is admirable.", "NTA.\n\nYou can\u2019t undo what you\u2019ve done, but you\u2019ve made an attempt to do the best you can to make things as right as they can be. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019d have no use for you without the money.
