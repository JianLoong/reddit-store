It could have taken precious time away from your wife and baby while everyone rushed around to get you out of the way. You did the right thing. NTA", "NTA. Know your body and it\u2019s limitations. You had expert medical staff their to\nhelp with the parts you could not. Leaving meant the medical pros could focus on her, not be distracted by you. If your partner can\u2019t see that, you might need couples counseling. Her expectations are too high.", "NTA Your wife might be pissed, but the OR staff is not.  It\u2019s really obnoxious when the dad passes out.  Literally we cannot take care if another person besides mom and baby.  We will drag you out of the way and leave you there until we are done.  It\u2019s not pretty and if you pass out you will not be there for your wife as you will will be unconscious.  You did the right thing.", "NAH. You\u2019re not the asshole, but neither is your wife. You did the right thing stepping out for a moment to collect yourself so you weren\u2019t in the way of the medical team. Your wife, though, is recovering from a major medical procedure and a shitton of hormones are bombarding her right now. Tell her you are sorry you had to step out, but that you didn\u2019t want to cause more problems by potentially passing out. Tell her you love her and your new baby and want to do whatever you can to help her recover and feel more comfortable, and genuinely mean those things. Ask her what you can do to help her rebuild the trust and faith she had in you before, and if she doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t seem receptive to that question, just be there for her. Get her water. Change the baby for her (as carrying baby is probably hard for her or even restricted per doctor\u2019s orders). Make dinner. Do the dishes and laundry. Take your older kiddo out to the park and let the baby nap in the stroller to give your wife a chance to be at home alone for 30 minutes or whatever. Doing these types of things will show her that you show up and you\u2019re willing to put in the work to help her feel better and will help her regain the trust/faith she feels is missing right now. And maybe in a few days/weeks/months she will look back on how she felt when you had to step out and realize that yeah it was the best decision in the moment, even if it didn\u2019t emotionally feel good.", "NTA. it would have done no one any good if you passed out in the OR and caused a big scene.", "NHA  as a women I think you did the right thing.  She has the right to be hurt.  FYI my husband almost past out with our second child and it was a regular delivery.  My second labor was a lot shorter.  I get it she needed you but you would have been as no use if you had your own medical emergency issues.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Cut your wife some slack, because she obviously went through a horrific experience (where she could not just step out of the room for a minute, hence the resentment). With some more time, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll realize that you passing out in the delivery room would have just made everything worse, as you mentioned.", "NAH. Obviously what your wife was going through was definitely more stressful and traumatic but it's really difficult to be supportive when you've passed out or are vomiting in the delivery room. Apologize to your wife for not being in there but just explain you thought you took the best option given the circumstances instead of making medical personnel in the delivery room attend to you if you had passed out.", "NAH but ask her how to regain her trust. I absolutely think you passing out in the room would have been way worse. While not childbirth my husband had to not be in the room for a couple of procedures I've had because he can't deal with me in that much pain. It's an empathy thing and an overwhelmed thing and I've been mad but I get over it. It takes him time to deal with that and it takes me time to heal. He made up for a lot of it by caring for more of the stuff when I needed a catheter and bedside commode and still need him to even bring me food and drinks. Anyway he made up for it. We've decided how to deal with stuff in future and what he can handle and what I need. My dr helped because he told me that even though all the medical stuff I've gone through is me and not him he has medical PTSD from his part in dealing with it. Which I had to think about but I agree with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Tbh they would just leave you on the floor but it'd be stressful on your wife still so..  point is you didn't abandon her. You did the smart thing and took yourself out of the situation and came back when you calmed yourself and was there for your wife. And it was only a few minutes.", "NTA... passing out would have been a distraction when your wife needed the medical staff focused on her. \nIt's not uncommon....", "NTA: The fact is, some people can\u2019t handle it. It\u2019s not your fault and that situation would scare anyone. You did the right thing as passing out would cause the medical professionals to help you and your wife to be more stresses and of course the fact you\u2019d have passed out which is not good.", "NTA my husband had to do the same during my 1st birth. What would have happened if you passed out or vomited all over the delivery room?", "NAH. \n\nShe can\u2019t trust him to power through whatever\u2019s going on in his head so he can support the person going through the painful, scary, potentially fatal experience. \n\nthat said, it\u2019s not his fault that he can\u2019t / couldn\u2019t do it, except possibly by failing to prepare himself. \n\nSo she\u2019s can be generally upset but shouldn\u2019t *blame* him; however he should understand that she can\u2019t trust him to stay and support her because he couldn\u2019t stay to support her. \n\nAnd frankly she probably has ptsd from the overall experience. It\u2019s very very common. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason Vikings honored men who died in battle  and women who died in childbirth.\n\nEdit: you should also plan to have a second support person ( with a strong stomach ) for any future births. You obviously can\u2019t be the only one if this is an issue.", "My husband had to sit down after our son\u2019s birth before he passed out C-Section.  I laughed that everyone was worried about him as I laid there with a belly cut open.  NTA - things happen.  Your wife needs to get over herself", "NTA. My dad had to do this and my mom thinks it\u2019s funny. He just suddenly stated \u201cI\u2019m gong to have a cigarette\u201d and left. The man was in Vietnam too. It was the hip new thing for dads to be in the delivery room too. Would your wife have preferred toy pass out and fall on the floor taking attention away from her?", "NTA.\n\nPuking or fainting would have been far worse. You made it back in time for the c-section. Your wife just had a baby, and a traumatic birth. There\u2019s a lot of hormones involved, right now. Give her some time to work herself through it.", "NTA Absolutely every medical person would say leaving before you passed out was better than passing out in that room. You are then, in the way. You can\u2019t be supportive when you are edge on fainting. She is already lying in bed so if she faints, she isn\u2019t going to knock her head in the floor.", "I have mixed feelings here. Probably because I've been in the situation where I've had a spouse \"too overcome\" by stress to actually support me through a procedure, and it **sucks**. We're not together anymore.\n\nFTR, I've also been on the opposite side, where I needed to support a partner through major medical procedures. \n\nI get that your physical empathy was high and you were struggling to cope.\n\nBut I don't think your emotional empathy was very good in the heat of the moment.\n\nYou were focused on the physical sensations and how horrible it must physically feel for your wife and baby, and you felt a bit of that yourself. You forgot about how they were feeling emotionally and what they needed from you -- the person in the least amount of pain -- in that moment.\n\nThey didn't need you to focus on *how you'd physically feel if you were them*. They needed you to focus on *what you'd need for emotional support if you were them* and provide that support.\n\nYou did the right thing *once you'd already messed up*. Leaving so you didn't create an extra hazard for staff was OK. But in future, you need to have your head in the game. Focus on why you're there and who you're there for. \n\nYou left your wife at a crucial point when she was scared and in serious pain, and she had to hear the c-section news by herself. No support. \n\nSo: gentle YTA. I get how you came to do what you did, and it's not the hugest of infractions in the scheme of things. Maybe think about how you're approaching support situations in general, though, because for your wife to *lose faith* in you over a 5-minute lapse implies that this is a common pattern for you.", "Soft YTA\u2026\n\nThere was no winning this one but what your wife endured was so painful for you to watch that you couldn\u2019t, she endured that, for you, and without you.\n\nPregnancy and labor are incredibly hard and vulnerable times and she needed you for those minutes you were collecting yourself, she continued to endure what you couldn\u2019t and alone because you couldn\u2019t", "Soft YTA. If you genuinely thought you were going to pass out, taking medical focus away from her, and there was nothing you could do then I kinda get it I guess\u2026 but seriously she\u2019s the one who was in labor, experiencing all this first hand, and she didn\u2019t have the option to tap out and take a breather. If you\u2019re the person she chose to have in the room with her you really have one job, to be there to support her.", "Sorry honey, with our next kid I promise to face plant in the middle of the delivery room.", "NTA.  She\u2019s suuuuuper hormonal rn.  She is sleep deprived and probably in a lot of pain still. She will forget about it. Don\u2019t worry!", "YTA \n\nShe was scared, in pain and alone, this is THE moment she needed your support. Bring a chair, hold her hand, give her something.\nIf you can\u2019t tolerate anything you should have sent her mom or doula with her, someone to be actually there.", "INFO does your wife typically paint you into the no win situation or is this a one off?", "NTA but I do believe if she had to endure that you\u2019ve got to stick in there. You didn\u2019t feel like you were going to pass out when you were having the sex did you?! I kid but you should think about this the next time the idea of another kid goes through your head lol", "NTA \n\nYou knew your limits. \n\nPassing out and having all the attention on you would be even worse. \n\nThey told my dad, back in the day, \u201cyou pass out we kick you out of the way\u201d\n\nRemoving yourself is waaaaay better than passing out. \n\nAlso watching someone in that much pain and being able to do nothing is kinda traumatic in itself. I remember at my friend labour she yelled at me to \u201cstop sniffing\u201d as I was trying not to cry watching her pain. I get that it\u2019s all about them, they are in pain, but you\u2019re human too. And watching someone you love go through that much pain is bloody hard. \n\nNow you know why they kick us out of every hospital room except a labour ward. Every other operation or coding or issue gets us booted out of the patients room so we aren\u2019t in their way. \n\nYou did the right thing. \n\nLet her calm down and let her emotions settle and she will see that. Just let her be angry and agree and apologise and know you did the right thing", "NTA, in my state. The dad's aren't even allowed in the delivery rooms anymore for C-sections or if they have to turn the baby due to a dad PASSING OUT during the birth and DYING cuz he hit his head and basically bled out under the bed since the doctors couldn't help him.\nSo ask your wife flat out, how would she have reacted had you passed out and gotten hurt? Genuinely. And this is coming from someone who had a kid 4 months ago.", "Yeah, as a doctor, I tell all the fathers in deliveries that we do not want a third patient so please sit down or leave if necessary. The last thing people want in a delivery is another patient.", "There isn't any trust and faith to rebuild here.  I'm not saying that his wife isn't thinking with her emotions, but that doesn't excuse her blaming him for a clear physical reaction to what he was seeing.  She is not right and she is an asshole for blaming him for that reaction.  He didn't abandon her and there is nothing to make up for here.  It may take time for her to see that, but that burden isn't on him, but on her.  They should seek couples counseling if this continues to be an issue, but the solution isn't for him to grovel towards her for something he didn't do wrong.", "Thank you! So many people are voting n t a, implying wife is the AH, which is mean.", "\u2018Rebuild trust and faith\u2019? Why are people upvoting this? He did nothing wrong. He thought he was going to faint so he left the room. What the hell was he supposed to do? Faint/vomit on his wife and the medical team?\n\nPlease do explain to us all what other options he had?", "He can't support her if he's on the verge of passing out or puking which could stress her out more...", "Im sorry but do you sincerely expect people to just get over their nausea? All because she can't get a breather he shouldn't even though it could make the situation more stressful if he didn't? Even doctors and nurses expect husbands to step out if they can't truly handle it so it's less stressful on the woman and on the doctors.. and someone needs to be calm enough to be there for their wife and baby.. that requires fulfilling his needs as well.. which is a breather", "So what happens if he passes out? He literally can\u2019t control that reaction, so there\u2019s no way you can tell him to \u201cstick in there\u201d when it\u2019s a bodily reaction he literally can\u2019t control", "Exactly. The nurse pushed my husband into a chair when he went all pale and almost passed out during my first delivery. Literally told him we don\u2019t need a third patient. We were better prepared for the second kid \ud83d\ude02", "A normal birth without complications can be traumatic and cause literal PTSD in women. This was way more intense and WAY more traumatic. Is she wrong to blame him? Yes. Does that make her an A H? I would argue no, not in this situation. She\u2019s been through something awful and needs understanding and compassion, not condemnation. \n\nIf she\u2019s still blaming him in 3 months? Yeah, definite A H territory. But OP says they \u201cjust\u201d had the baby, so I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re at 2-6 weeks. Her entire body has changed.\n\nThat being said, he\u2019s 100% in the right. If I\u2019m right about this being super recent, though, she\u2019s not an A H either.", "I mean, she can\u2019t trust him to power through whatever\u2019s going on in his head so he can support the person going through the procedure. It may not be his fault but he did literally show that he might not be there.", " ESH is more implying she's the ah tbh.", "The post literally says a week ago.  I'm not saying she didn't go through a traumatic experience.  I'm saying that her projection of her trauma into blame on him is asshole behavior.  Should she been given some leeway to work through that trauma, absolutely, but the recommendations in the comment I replied to are not a good solution here.  Therapy is.", "But this isn\u2019t a reaction going on \u201cin his head,\u201d it\u2019s a literally physical reaction. If you want to blame someone for a literal physical reaction they can\u2019t control go ahead, but you won\u2019t look reasonable.", "Fuck off with that shit.  If you literally think that, you need therapy.  People being unable to control their physical reactions to negative stimuli says nothing about their ability to be there for their significant other.", "Well, yeah. ESH means both are the AH. NTA means OP is not the AH, while the other party is. NAH means neither are, which I think is what\u2019s going on in this case."]}
