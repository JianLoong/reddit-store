It could have taken precious time away from your wife and baby while everyone rushed around to get you out of the way. You did the right thing. NTA", "NTA. Know your body and it\u2019s limitations. You had expert medical staff their to\nhelp with the parts you could not. Leaving meant the medical pros could focus on her, not be distracted by you. If your partner can\u2019t see that, you might need couples counseling. Her expectations are too high.", "NTA Your wife might be pissed, but the OR staff is not.  It\u2019s really obnoxious when the dad passes out.  Literally we cannot take care if another person besides mom and baby.  We will drag you out of the way and leave you there until we are done.  It\u2019s not pretty and if you pass out you will not be there for your wife as you will will be unconscious.  You did the right thing.", "NAH. You\u2019re not the asshole, but neither is your wife. You did the right thing stepping out for a moment to collect yourself so you weren\u2019t in the way of the medical team. Your wife, though, is recovering from a major medical procedure and a shitton of hormones are bombarding her right now. Tell her you are sorry you had to step out, but that you didn\u2019t want to cause more problems by potentially passing out. Tell her you love her and your new baby and want to do whatever you can to help her recover and feel more comfortable, and genuinely mean those things. Ask her what you can do to help her rebuild the trust and faith she had in you before, and if she doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t seem receptive to that question, just be there for her. Get her water. Change the baby for her (as carrying baby is probably hard for her or even restricted per doctor\u2019s orders). Make dinner. Do the dishes and laundry. Take your older kiddo out to the park and let the baby nap in the stroller to give your wife a chance to be at home alone for 30 minutes or whatever. Doing these types of things will show her that you show up and you\u2019re willing to put in the work to help her feel better and will help her regain the trust/faith she feels is missing right now. And maybe in a few days/weeks/months she will look back on how she felt when you had to step out and realize that yeah it was the best decision in the moment, even if it didn\u2019t emotionally feel good.", "NTA. it would have done no one any good if you passed out in the OR and caused a big scene.", "NHA  as a women I think you did the right thing.  She has the right to be hurt.  FYI my husband almost past out with our second child and it was a regular delivery.  My second labor was a lot shorter.  I get it she needed you but you would have been as no use if you had your own medical emergency issues.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Cut your wife some slack, because she obviously went through a horrific experience (where she could not just step out of the room for a minute, hence the resentment). With some more time, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll realize that you passing out in the delivery room would have just made everything worse, as you mentioned.", "NAH. Obviously what your wife was going through was definitely more stressful and traumatic but it's really difficult to be supportive when you've passed out or are vomiting in the delivery room. Apologize to your wife for not being in there but just explain you thought you took the best option given the circumstances instead of making medical personnel in the delivery room attend to you if you had passed out.", "NAH but ask her how to regain her trust. I absolutely think you passing out in the room would have been way worse. While not childbirth my husband had to not be in the room for a couple of procedures I've had because he can't deal with me in that much pain. It's an empathy thing and an overwhelmed thing and I've been mad but I get over it. It takes him time to deal with that and it takes me time to heal. He made up for a lot of it by caring for more of the stuff when I needed a catheter and bedside commode and still need him to even bring me food and drinks. Anyway he made up for it. We've decided how to deal with stuff in future and what he can handle and what I need. My dr helped because he told me that even though all the medical stuff I've gone through is me and not him he has medical PTSD from his part in dealing with it.

It\u2019s very very common. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason Vikings honored men who died in battle  and women who died in childbirth.\n\nEdit: you should also plan to have a second support person ( with a strong stomach ) for any future births.

I laughed that everyone was worried about him as I laid there with a belly cut open.  NTA - things happen.  Your wife needs to get over herself", "NTA. My dad had to do this and my mom thinks it\u2019s funny. He just suddenly stated \u201cI\u2019m gong to have a cigarette\u201d and left. The man was in Vietnam too. It was the hip new thing for dads to be in the delivery room too. Would your wife have preferred toy pass out and fall on the floor taking attention away from her?", "NTA.\n\nPuking or fainting would have been far worse. You made it back in time for the c-section. Your wife just had a baby, and a traumatic birth. There\u2019s a lot of hormones involved, right now. Give her some time to work herself through it.", "NTA Absolutely every medical person would say leaving before you passed out was better than passing out in that room. You are then, in the way. You can\u2019t be supportive when you are edge on fainting. She is already lying in bed so if she faints, she isn\u2019t going to knock her head in the floor.", "I have mixed feelings here. Probably because I've been in the situation where I've had a spouse \"too overcome\" by stress to actually support me through a procedure, and it **sucks**. We're not together anymore.\n\nFTR, I've also been on the opposite side, where I needed to support a partner through major medical procedures. \n\nI get that your physical empathy was high and you were struggling to cope.\n\nBut I don't think your emotional empathy was very good in the heat of the moment.\n\nYou were focused on the physical sensations and how horrible it must physically feel for your wife and baby, and you felt a bit of that yourself. You forgot about how they were feeling emotionally and what they needed from you -- the person in the least amount of pain -- in that moment.\n\nThey didn't need you to focus on *how you'd physically feel if you were them*. They needed you to focus on *what you'd need for emotional support if you were them* and provide that support.\n\nYou did the right thing *once you'd already messed up*. Leaving so you didn't create an extra hazard for staff was OK. But in future, you need to have your head in the game. Focus on why you're there and who you're there for. \n\nYou left your wife at a crucial point when she was scared and in serious pain, and she had to hear the c-section news by herself. No support. \n\nSo: gentle YTA. I get how you came to do what you did, and it's not the hugest of infractions in the scheme of things. Maybe think about how you're approaching support situations in general, though, because for your wife to *lose faith* in you over a 5-minute lapse implies that this is a common pattern for you.", "Soft YTA\u2026\n\nThere was no winning this one but what your wife endured was so painful for you to watch that you couldn\u2019t, she endured that, for you, and without you.\n\nPregnancy and labor are incredibly hard and vulnerable times and she needed you for those minutes you were collecting yourself, she continued to endure what you couldn\u2019t and alone because you couldn\u2019t", "Soft YTA. If you genuinely thought you were going to pass out, taking medical focus away from her, and there was nothing you could do then I kinda get it I guess\u2026 but seriously she\u2019s the one who was in labor, experiencing all this first hand, and she didn\u2019t have the option to tap out and take a breather.

I remember at my friend labour she yelled at me to \u201cstop sniffing\u201d as I was trying not to cry watching her pain. I get that it\u2019s all about them, they are in pain, but you\u2019re human too. And watching someone you love go through that much pain is bloody hard. \n\nNow you know why they kick us out of every hospital room except a labour ward. Every other operation or coding or issue gets us booted out of the patients room so we aren\u2019t in their way. \n\nYou did the right thing. \n\nLet her calm down and let her emotions settle and she will see that. Just let her be angry and agree and apologise and know you did the right thing", "NTA, in my state. The dad's aren't even allowed in the delivery rooms anymore for C-sections or if they have to turn the baby due to a dad PASSING OUT during the birth and DYING cuz he hit his head and basically bled out under the bed since the doctors couldn't help him.\nSo ask your wife flat out, how would she have reacted had you passed out and gotten hurt? Genuinely. And this is coming from someone who had a kid 4 months ago.", "Yeah, as a doctor, I tell all the fathers in deliveries that we do not want a third patient so please sit down or leave if necessary. The last thing people want in a delivery is another patient.", "There isn't any trust and faith to rebuild here.  I'm not saying that his wife isn't thinking with her emotions, but that doesn't excuse her blaming him for a clear physical reaction to what he was seeing.  She is not right and she is an asshole for blaming him for that reaction.  He didn't abandon her and there is nothing to make up for here.  It may take time for her to see that, but that burden isn't on him, but on her.  They should seek couples counseling if this continues to be an issue, but the solution isn't for him to grovel towards her for something he didn't do wrong.", "Thank you! So many people are voting n t a, implying wife is the AH, which is mean.", "\u2018Rebuild trust and faith\u2019? Why are people upvoting this? He did nothing wrong.

All because she can't get a breather he shouldn't even though it could make the situation more stressful if he didn't? Even doctors and nurses expect husbands to step out if they can't truly handle it so it's less stressful on the woman and on the doctors.. and someone needs to be calm enough to be there for their wife and baby.. that requires fulfilling his needs as well.. which is a breather", "So what happens if he passes out? He literally can\u2019t control that reaction, so there\u2019s no way you can tell him to \u201cstick in there\u201d when it\u2019s a bodily reaction he literally can\u2019t control", "Exactly. The nurse pushed my husband into a chair when he went all pale and almost passed out during my first delivery. Literally told him we don\u2019t need a third patient. We were better prepared for the second kid \ud83d\ude02", "A normal birth without complications can be traumatic and cause literal PTSD in women. This was way more intense and WAY more traumatic. Is she wrong to blame him? Yes. Does that make her an A H? I would argue no, not in this situation. She\u2019s been through something awful and needs understanding and compassion, not condemnation. \n\nIf she\u2019s still blaming him in 3 months? Yeah, definite A H territory. But OP says they \u201cjust\u201d had the baby, so I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re at 2-6 weeks. Her entire body has changed.\n\nThat being said, he\u2019s 100% in the right. If I\u2019m right about this being super recent, though, she\u2019s not an A H either.", "I mean, she can\u2019t trust him to power through whatever\u2019s going on in his head so he can support the person going through the procedure. It may not be his fault but he did literally show that he might not be there.", " ESH is more implying she's the ah tbh.", "The post literally says a week ago.  I'm not saying she didn't go through a traumatic experience.  I'm saying that her projection of her trauma into blame on him is asshole behavior.  Should she been given some leeway to work through that trauma, absolutely, but the recommendations in the comment I replied to are not a good solution here.  Therapy is.", "But this isn\u2019t a reaction going on \u201cin his head,\u201d it\u2019s a literally physical reaction. If you want to blame someone for a literal physical reaction they can\u2019t control go ahead, but you won\u2019t look reasonable.", "Fuck off with that shit.  If you literally think that, you need therapy.  People being unable to control their physical reactions to negative stimuli says nothing about their ability to be there for their significant other.", "Well, yeah. ESH means both are the AH. NTA means OP is not the AH, while the other party is. NAH means neither are, which I think is what\u2019s going on in this case.", "NAH\n\nNo use for you to pass out causing not only the medical personnel to tend to you but it would also stress out your wife. You did the right thing. She feels hurt, which is normal since it was an invasive procedure where she was probably feeling pain and was scared for herself and the baby. \n\nDo your best during post-partum to make her feel comfortable while she heals. If possible, try to take over watching the children when you can so she can rest a bit more, especially for the first couple of weeks. (Encourage her to rest when possible, fluids, and avoiding anything that could disrupt the healing process)  If bottle feeding do your best to have things prepped so baby gets fed fast. (Ex if formula prep a bottle with dry powder and another with the correct amount of water so either of you can just quickly mix it without fuss)\n\nThe important thing is to talk it out; explain that you did not want to cause any issues and stepped out. Try not to get into an argument about it, just keep calm and reassure that you are there to support her and the kids.\n\nCongratulations to you both, I hope everything works out!", "NAH. You knew your limits and didn\u2019t want to become more of a problem. That\u2019s totally reasonable. But I don\u2019t think your wife is an AH either. You\u2019re probably just going to have to let her be mad at you and deal with it. Imagining how much it sucked for her made it hard for you? She actually had to go through it.", "NAH - I get that you felt you needed to leave in the moment. I would argue that part of being a birth partner is preparing BEFOREHAND for how you\u2019ll cope in situations where stressful difficult things are happening (my husband has medical-triggered vaso-vagal-synchopy so part of our birth planning was what to do if he felt faint) - focusing on her face instead of her belly, taking deep breaths, holding her hand while closing your eyes and repeating something soothing to yourself to bring yourself back, sitting down by her head and leaning onto the bed with her, etc - but you hadn\u2019t done that and it caught you by surprise. Leaving was better than passing out. You did the right thing.\n\nBut your wife\u2019s feelings of hurt are also really valid. Just think for a moment - if it was so upsetting to *watch* that you were unable to endure it, how hard must have been for her to *experience*, without the option to leave, and without the support of someone she cared about. As someone who gave birth in the pandemic so had to do large parts of it alone, alone 100000% makes it worse. So yeah, that was probably pretty horrible for her. Remember as well that we literally cannot control our emotions - if she\u2019s punishing you in any way, that\u2019s a problem, but she can\u2019t magic herself into not feeling upset.\n\nYou were allowed to leave in response to your bodily sensations. She\u2019s allowed to feel sad and let down. You still love each other, and you will both work past it in the coming weeks and months as things settle down. Sending love, it\u2019s hard!", "NTA. I think if I were in your position I'd have instantly passed out.\n\nHowever i do sense communication issues. If you said \"staying there probably would have caused more problems\" word for word (or something along those lines) without elaborating your REASONING for leaving, perhaps you are not communicating clearly that you felt like you were going to faint, which genuinely would have been more troublesome. For all we all know, she could be thinking you got lazy or you felt there was no need to be by her side.\n\nThere are also many resources and videos online to let her understand how truly visually horrifying it is to watch his own wife be handled (as I imagine) roughly.\n\nI can tell you understand your wife's pov, but maybe articulate your own pov more clearly to her so she understands yours. Let her know it was in no way your intention to make her lose hope in you. You took a very needed break to calm your nausea.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and congrats on your newborn!", "NTA, this happened to me. My husband had to leave since he was getting extremely queasy. Sure it sucked and it was scary to be left alone, but I\u2019d had morning sickness for 6 months so I totally empathized and the last thing I wanted was for him to throw up in the operating theatre. \n\nI never once gave him shit for it, it\u2019s just one of those things. We did agree that for a future c-section I will have my Mom accompany me into the operating theater since he has such a weak stomach for that kind of thing, but that\u2019s just a practical decision, I don\u2019t blame him for something that he had no control over.", "NAH. But you do need to apologize. Even though you had a valid reason to leave. Here\u2019s the thing. I bet she wanted to leave the room too! I bet she also felt like she was going to faint at times and if she could just leave everything would be fine. But she couldn\u2019t because it was happening to her. You being there may have been what was helping her keep it together. But unlike her you had the option of leaving. So you did. And in doing so you left her alone at what sounds  like the worst part of the whole birth. The number of times I\u2019ve heard someone I know say that their SO had to leave the room at some point during their stay at the hospital because \u201cthey were so hungry they were about to faint\u201d, or \u201cso tired they couldn\u2019t function\u201d, or just \u201cneeded to go throw up\u201d and the mother of their soon to be born child has stared right back at them thinking \u201cme too, but I\u2019m not allowed to leave\u201d. This may not be along the same line of things, but when things got bad you left, even if it was for a valid reason, but she may have really needed you and wanted to leave too. So you\u2019re really apologizing for not being able to be there when she needed it and for being able to leave when she wasn\u2019t. Even if those are both things you cannot control.", "NAH. My wife had to leave me so as not to throw up or pass out during one of my c-sections. I did feel a bit hung out to dry but also realized it would\u2019ve caused more issues if she had stayed and been sick. This was a no-win for you but you did the best thing.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. But I can also understand where she's coming from, given that she was the one undergoing this terrifying and horrifically painful thing. Losing faith in you is not the right reaction, but that could be trauma rather than objective-facts related. Is therapy possible?", "100% NTA. When I gave birth to our first child, the hospital staff told my husband, if he even felt like he was going to pass out to step outside. The dad the day before we delivered did just that during the epidural- straight passed out when he saw them take that long needle to his wife\u2019s spine, hit his head on the corner of the hospital bed, had a brain hemorrhage and literally died that day. So when we went in to deliver, staff was not messing around. Your wife is emotional right now. Give her some time and hopefully she\u2019ll see that this was something for the best.", "NTA, if you had passed out in the delivery room you would have been a whole other new patient that everyone would have had to divert attention to.  Attention that was desperately needed by your wife and unborn child.  Never distract people that are operating on your wife. You absolutely did the right thing by leaving and keeping your wife and child safe, but also you kept yourself safe.  If you had actually passed out they would have taken you down to the emergency room and strongly encouraged you get scans so you would have missed the c-section all together.\n\nBut in the future, don't watch for so long that you get caught up and get lightheaded.  It's 100% ok to look away.  Close your eyes, take deep breaths, wiggle your toes, etc.  This goes for anything: lab draws, IVs, shots, etc.", "YTA", "Tell your wife i said she is being the asshole in all of this. You did the right thing. Ask any doctor. NTA.", "I have seen this technique first hand and it wasn't easy to watch. I didn't think I could make it.

You're not the asshole for doing what you needed to do to be ok- good for you. However as a mom who has three kids for us woman there is no tapping out. She can't 'step out' during labor. So both of you are valid in your feelings. Did you do what you have to do- yes. But in doing so did you leave her there- abandoned bc she needed you and expected you to not leave her side until she gave birth to your child- yes, you did. Was that your intent I don't believe it was. However it is what it is. The question is do you want to be right or do you want to get to a better place in your marriage?  If it's the latter than go to couples counseling. If she doesn't want to go then you go alone and you learn how to help her understand what you're trying to convey while acknowledging and accepting her experience. If you argue with her she's going to run that through her mind over and over again and that's going to play with her mental health. Please don't do that. I had a very similar experience and I have never forgotten that feeling of abandonment nearly 13 years ago- it like or happened yesterday.", "Now\u2026 I am NOT saying you shouldn\u2019t have left. You should have. In a medical environment, during a medical procedure, you would have been in the way and taken resources needed for her.. away from her. So.. NTA. Your reasoning is sound. \n\n.. but remember that no matter how *she* felt, when you\u2019re giving birth there is no \u201cstepping out,\u201d no matter how uncomfortable or scary. And in her mind you were going through it together. So I see how in a moment where they were physically manipulating her body and contemplating a slicing her open for C section (*not* a small thing and very scary for some women when you\u2019re hoping for this not to be your birth plan), and you up and leave, she feels abandoned. YOU felt so disturbed by what they were doing to *her* body that you felt physically ill. Imagine how *she* felt. \n\nSo instead of defending yourself again and again when she brings it up (you know you did nothing wrong), try telling her that you don\u2019t want to argue anymore, but you just want her to know that you *understand* why she is upset. Why she felt abandoned in that moment. That you\u2019re disappointed you weren\u2019t able to stay with her. That you\u2019re proud of her for everything that happened that day. That you\u2019re aware of all of the above. \n\nI don\u2019t mean just allowing her to make you out to be an AH. Don\u2019t accept any emotional punishment you don\u2019t feel you deserve. But you\u2019d be surprised how quickly simply coming into a conflict with empathy instead of defensiveness can head off an argument.\n\nAnd a lot of times when people jump straight to recommending couples counselling\u2026 it\u2019s because couples are not doing this. In any marriage, focus less on who was or wasn\u2019t right, and show more consideration for how the other person feels. That\u2019s why they always recommend \u201cI feel\u201d statements, etc. Most initial issue-specific marriage counselling exercises are about helping each person try to understand and acknowledge how the other feels.", "That assumes he doesn't do/say those things already.
