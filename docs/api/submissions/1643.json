There's no other feeling like it. It's like finding a lighthouse when you're lost at sea. \n\nBut... maybe your sister has actually secretly lamented the fact that she isn't closer to your grandmother? Maybe see if she wants to be included in conversations more. I don't know. It could be that your sister just doesn't know *how* to talk to your grandma (not in Korean, I just mean conversationally), and is jealous that someone from outside the family can walk in and be accepted so readily, and your sister only sees that this outsider is Asian, and thinks that must be the reason. \n\nI don't know. Either way, you're definitely not TA in this scenario.", "NTA. If your sister has a problem then it should be your grandma that she focuses on.\n\nAlso \"*racist*\" lol. Isn't it wild that the grandma, whose main goal of the trip is to see if she wants to move back to her cultural roots, would want to take the one person who is also super appreciative of that culture to the country of said culture?\n\nLike, your sister needs to give y'alls grandmother some slack. It'd be one thing if she didn't take you on the trip either, you know?\n\nThe \"maybe you should've been more interested in the culture\" comment mightve been a bit harsh but honestly it sounded like she deserved it. She's acting entitled. It could be an insecurity but that doesn't excuse her on lashing out like that.", "NTA. Your grandmother is planning a trip with someone she has a strong bond with, who isn't related to her. \n\nIt sounds like *you* aren't even going. It's not a *family* trip, it's a *reconnecting to Korea* trip, and if she wants to go, she can ask if she can come along and pay for her OWN way, instead of engaging in what sounds like homophobic abuse toward your boyfriend.", "NTA - it\u2019s true. Your grandma is doing an incredibly sweet thing by reconnecting with her own culture/home country and taking someone with her to see their own for the first time. They\u2019ve connected over this and it is obviously very important to the both of them. \n\nIf your sister has as issue or would like to also go, she should voice that to your grandma because by all accounts, it doesn\u2019t sound like your grandma would know that at all. Name calling is also totally unnecessary and your bf did nothing in this situation to deserve it.", "Your grandmother is allowed to have friendships, too. I'm sure she'd rather go with a friend who shared her interest in the destination. NTA", "NTA. This makes no sense anyway. Why is she fighting with you over something you have no say in? If this is so important to her, why isn't she talking to the woman who is planning and paying for the trip? Is it because she knows damn well that she isn't entitled to a trip that has nothing to do with her? I'm gonna say, yes.", "Your sister is a homophobic A hole. She\u2019s unhappy and jealous about the trip. Had she shown any interest in Korean culture she could\u2019ve been going on the trip and now wishes she did.  NTA", "NTA - Your grandma is allowed to have her own friends.", "NTA. For one thing, your BF is expressing a major interest in connecting with his culture, something that he and your grandmother have in common. Your sister only cares about the vacation and not the purpose behind it. I'm pretty sure if she had gone with your grandmother, she be screaming to go back home within 48 hours.", "NTA. \n\nYour grandmother is going on a trip with someone who shares and appreciates her cultural heritage. It has nothing to do with family/you and your sister.", "NTA. it has nothing to do w disregarding her grandkids, she\u2019s found someone who she can really connect w on a cultural basis and she\u2019s probably overjoyed!", "NTA. He expressed a sincere desire to reconnect with his heritage, and he speaks Korean. It is much easier to travel with someone who speaks the local language, and someone who is interested in learning all there is to learn. Sounds like your BF is friends with your grandma and she wants to go on a trip with her friend. I can empathize with grandma loving your partner more than you though: mine loved my now wife so passionately she stopped in to visit us on her way through our town even though I wasn't home. They made several trips together regularly before she passed.  I was worried about coming out to her, but the way she loved my wife made it a lot easier.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your sister is jealous (either of not getting to go on the trip, or not spending time with your Grandma, or maybe both). I think that's perhaps understandable? It is NOT understandable though the way she's expressing her jealousy. I don't think you need to feel bad about \"not hearing her out\" when she's acting this way. Maybe if she can communicate more calmly and rationally about her feelings once she's calmed down, then you should try to hear her out? \n\nI think it's normal for people to want to visit and connect to where they're from. Maybe your sister never expressed much interest previously but I don't think there's a time limit on being able to care about something like that. Maybe she can go on a seperate trip? \n\nI also don't think there's a time limit on wanting to get to know your grandparents. Even if it is the trip that was the spark that got her to engage more with her grandma (which is kind of a selfish reason imo), it's a *good thing* if your sister wants to spend time with her. You never know how long people will be in our lives. I think there's probably enough love from your grandma to go around to all of you (even if your sister might not see it that way right now). \u2764", "NTA. \n\nYour grandmother has lived most of her life away from her home country and those that are attached to it. She is absolutely loving having someone to speak in Korean and share her history with. It isn't a slight on anyone, it should be looked at as the universe (kismet is a great term for this) brought her a new loved one to bring her happiness and memories. She now has the energy- and partner- to go back to Korea. \n\nAnd yes, if others had shown excitement in this part of your ancestry over the years, they may have been offered the trip too or instead of him. But, your boyfriend is what created this spark, and so of course he should be going.", "So,  Grandma asked her brand new BFF (who just happens to be your boyfriend) to go on a trip to Korea...She knows her new BFF will have ZERO issues with her dragging him all over SK,    all the while talking his ear off about what's different,  how things changed,  stories about her childhood...\n\nAnd now your sister is pissed because she is losing out on selfies and clout because she got to go to SK.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
