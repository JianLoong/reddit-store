My husband has a younger sister she is 26 who due to some financial issues been living with us for 4 years. When I was preganant last year  I was very tired and took a break from work which lead to some financial problems because now my husband pays for me who is pregnant and  plus another adult. He was working so much to provide us money so he didn't have time to help me. I asked my SIL for some help with the cooking and cleaning and she refused claiming that I shouldn't have had a child if I wasn't ready for one. The answer baffled me that I refused to talk to her again (mind you she said this while she was in my house and have been staying for 2 years while I was paying). I started excluding her from the meals and my husband who obviously noticed I am not including her and I told him what happened and he told me to continue not giving her anything and he'll deal with her which I did. We spent the rest of the year and the first half of this year not communicating. I gave birth to a healthy boy and thankfully our finances are stable as I was back to work later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe reason I felt hurt by her comment is that she has been living in my house rent free when my husband and I were splitting and I was doing everything for her for free and she never laid a hand in the house and I never complained until I physically couldn't coddle her anymore. I knew my husband and I didn't prepare 100% for pregnancy but we made it work just like we weren't ready to host an adult either but we made work.  My husband told me he'll pay for her so the payment won't be split 50% each but 75%:25% as I am one person and they are 2 and as for our child, he has a totally separate plan.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis caused a lot of fights between the siblings and he cannot handle how she is irresponsible she is.Their fight 3 weeks ago escalated so much because she called him a c\\*nt  that he told her by the end of this month  she'll move out and he doesn't care where she'll go she has to figure it out. She doesn't have a job because all those years she has been giving excuses and saying she'll get one but she still hasn't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said since last year we have been ignoring each other but yesterday she bragged into my room at midnight while my child was sleeping and started yelling at me I dragged her out she told me I am the reason her brother hates her and I am a \"home wrecker\" for not helping my husband with her expenses. To my luck he arrived minutes after which stopped her blow out and we entered our room ignoring her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes I am feeling bad that they became this bad with each other but I couldn't continue giving a grown woman money for free when she refused to don the bare minimum for me. I can't even tell my husband to be lenient when she is nothing but disrespectful to him. my friend told me I should've just sucked it and paid for her until she eventually found a place.", "created_utc": 1693078502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1624ej1/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_sil/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's already getting a free place to stay and doesn't need to pay for utilities. She doesn't help out with anything. What nerve!\n\nYou need to figure out your finances. A family living on a physician's salary, even one physician's salary, should not be struggling. I say that as the spouse of a physician with two kids in college. I used to look at his colleagues who had to work overtime to make ends meet and it blows my mind.", "Why didn\u2019t he kick her out after she said that terrible thing about not being ready for a baby? Your husband is to blame for this just as much as your SIL. You had to live with someone under the same roof without talking to each other for a year, because he wouldn\u2019t kick her out. You also didn\u2019t kick her out. You three are a dysfunctional family and deserve each other\u2019s company. The only innocent party here is the baby. ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's fine to live with family while she figures out her own life, but she needs to pull her own weight.

Not to mention she's disrupting your baby's sleep and startling him awake with her nonsense. She is long overdue to be kicked out. She'll only grow up when she has to do everything you guys have been doing for her by herself. Then she'll understand why she should have been helping around the house. And if you had been sick or injured instead of pregnant, would she have still blamed you for not being able to be her maid?? She doesn't make any sense.
