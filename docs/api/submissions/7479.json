I understand this might be hard for her because she was engaged and she was planning a wedding but she needs to be an adult and be happy for you. If she did this to a friend they wouldn't be friends anymore. If she can't do this to a friend she shouldn't do this to you. Be happy celebrate! Her issues are not your problem they are hers. Just like if your future husband had a mental break down be there and be supportive but ultimately it's his problem that you can't fix only professionals and himself can. NTA", "At the moment, YTA.\n\n>this is her first time being hospitalized, it's a result of my parents spoiling and coddling her her whole life\n\nWe all get that you're upset with her. She's been hyper-competitive and cruel to you forever. But correlation does not equal causation. Your assumption that her breakdown and hospitalization was due to coddling by your parents is unfounded.\n\nAnd, even if your guess is right, that doesn't change the fact that your sister is recovering from a breakdown that was severe enough to warrant hospitalization.\n\nYou ratcheting things up to nuclear level - threatening to go NC with your parents if they don't do what you demand - makes you an AH.\n\nYour dad is right that his circumstances and yours are different. He went NC with his family because they were bigoted. You're threatening to go NC because of a disagreement over how to handle a bona fide mental health crisis situation. The two are worlds apart.\n\nThat said, I do think you're justified to decline to visit your parents if your fianc\u00e9 is excluded. I just don't think you're justified in giving them an ultimatum in an attempt to force them to knowingly harm your sister's mental health.\n\nETA: From your [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dgho2/):\n\n>I told them it's one thing to disrespect me, but I will not stand for them disrespecting my fiance like this.\n\nMy standard rule of thumb is that whichever party is the first to mention \"respect\" or \"disrespect\" is always the AH.

Later maybe you and your fianc\u00e9 could take your mom out for lunch together.  Let your mom know that you are willing to keep things \"low profile\" for a short amount of time to accommodate your sisters situation, but the key word is \"short\" and the alternative is to go low/no contact with them if they can't respect your relationship and be happy for you.    \n\n\nSet a new date for the engagement party--- and let your sister know that if she can't make it you'll totally understand and support that choice.", "NTA.

You also stated that you \u201chad to keep a low profile\u201d because of your sister\u2019s jealousy in the past and the only example you could give of that actual happening was that your parents bought you a car and asked you to keep that quiet because they didn\u2019t want to have to buy your sister one. The fact that you\u2019re pissed about that seems ridiculous and spiteful to me - it\u2019s not like you actually accomplished something that you then had to hide for your sister\u2019s benefit.

One of their children had a mental health crisis and has to live with them as otherwise they won't b e released from the hospital, and they are asking you not to trigger her when you come to their home. I get why that's super annoying and feels unfair, but it also seems like a much bigger burden on your parents then on you? This only affects you a little bit, while the rest of your family is having a much worse time of it. \n\nDo you like your sister at all? Love her? None of that is mentioned in your post, no empathy or sympathy or concern. You describe her only negatively and make her seem shallow (and maybe she is?) but it really just comes off like you don't care about her *at all.* You mention she's competitive with you, but you are literally trying to threaten and bully your parents into choosing not mildly inconveniencing you over her mental health. It seems like you just care about your spotlight and your parents celebrating you, and not about her at all? Which, maybe she's awful, shallow, ridiculous, and you don't care at all how she feels. Fine. But you have to realize your parents are going to care, right? And you must want them to care about her feelings on some level, beacuse if they didn't, you could never trust them to love you either. You'd always wonder if this was the thing they'd stop giving an F about you over.\n\nMaybe your parent could have handled things better, but it dosen't seem like you've suggested anything to them either? What do you want them to do that will be the best way to support BOTH of their children and show BOTH of you love? Understanding that someone's complete mental collapse has to be weighed over a party.\n\nInvite your parents over without your sister to talk one on one. Lead with empathy. Ask them, how is sister doing? Ask them about how that makes *them* feel. Find out what they are afraid of. Are they in terror she will kill herself so bending forward backwards out of fear of losing their child? Are they horribly stressed and don't know what to do? Etc. Empathize. Even if you don't love your sister, imagine how it would feel if you did and it was your job to keep her safe and healthy as she was suddenly unable to do that herself but you didn't know how. Tell them how hard that sounds. How you're sorry they're dealing with that, it must be so scary/stressful/confusing/helpless/whatever they seem to be feeling.\n\nThen tell them how you feel and what you want, and work as a team to come up with ideas for how you can get your \"needs\" (want for validation/attention? Pride/feeling respected? Unclear here) met too. Think about what it really is you want. Do you want to know your parents love you as much as your sister, is that it? You already know they approve of your fianc\u00e9 and engagement so I don't really think you need to worry about that. Don't threaten them with no contact, try to come up with solutions as a team of all of you vs the problem instead of you making them pick between you and your sister. (Am I wrong that the core issue here is you think they picked her and you're trying to punish/threaten them into picking you instead?) \n\nIdeas of solutions (would help to know what your underlying want/need is): Maybe you could ask your parents if you could have dinner together with them and your fianc\u00e9e and his family at a nice restaurant or something to celebrate without sister instead of a party? Is that what would make you happy? Or do you just need to hear your parents say they love you as much as your sister? Do you need them to prove it somehow? I honestly don't see why it matters you fianc\u00e9e come to one birthday party if you know your parents like him and it's not about him (is he actually feeling upset/hurt/disrespected or are you feeling that on his behalf?) but if that's a red line for you maybe don't go to the party? But assure your mother you still love her and you and fianc\u00e9e would like to do something with her separately without your sister, you just want to make sure he's included?

OP can't pretend she's not with fiance forever. This is a losing battle  by the parents. What are they actually going to do come wedding time? Just hope it's gone away by then? Honestly, it's perfectly acceptable not to invite them because there's a high chance they are going to make demands for the wedding if they feel sister isn't well enough.

What if the sister still isn\u2019t in a stable place by the wedding? Are the parents going to miss the wedding to avoid the sister finding out? Is OP going to be expected to hide her marriage until her sister finds herself married? Also considering OP is engaged I imagine her sister already knows her fianc\u00e9 so why can\u2019t he be around? Are they suppose to pretend to be broken up, or just keep making excuses for his apparent avoidance of the family? When the sister inevitably finds out that they\u2019ve been lying to her, is that going to be conducive to her healing?

Fair game, but if the little sister is so fragile that seeing her sister's partner (I assume she has known about him for a while) has the potential to send her back to hospital, maybe they shouldn't be celebrating anything at all.

And if the sister can't be on her own, that's pretty serious. When mental health facilities send people home with a care plan, and that includes the patient not being by themselves, it usually means that the reason for hospitalization was... pretty bad. It also sounds like it was fairly recent, which means that the sister is probably just starting to heal and learning to cope. She's not there yet.

I agree that there's a huge lack of empathy for OP's sister or parents.

Your sister does need more help right now, but that shouldn't limit them to celebrating with you and being happy for you as well as supporting you and having a talk that maybe the SISTER is the one that shouldn't attend the birthday or events where it's likely someone will mention your engagement.", "I would say NTA. Yes, clearly your sister went through a traumatic experience for her, but you can\u2019t hide something like this. How would you explain it later like suddenly you\u2019re engaged at a random point but your wedding would be fully planned by yall and be so soon? Plus, do your parents expect you to keep it low key from everyone like your friends and his family as well? Seems extreme. I do think being no contact with them after your wedding might hurt you too if you still love them so maybe when things settle everyone sits and talks (with a mediator if necessary) but you definitely are NTA", "NTA. Yeah I'd be going NC. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA - is this your parents idea or your sister\u2019s?  It seems ridiculous that a 28 y/o woman would begrudge her 36 y/o sister happiness.  Your happiness is independent of your sister\u2019s.  It sounds like your parents need therapy because they\u2019re not doing your sister any favors.", "NTA. Man I'm having a field day with spoiled threads today lol. \nI'm so sorry your parents are doing this to you. \nIt would be one thing if you and the hubs to be made the choice. It's another whole level to be required. \nYour sister needs professional help. The man she was dating saw it a mile a way and waited until he could to make his escape. \n\nStick to your guns. She and your parents need to learn the hard way that her issues are not yours to deal with. \n\nThe world doesn't spin on broken glass. She better get a grip.", "NTA", "NTA. You're a solid person and a solid fiance.", "NTA:  To be fair she was hospitalized so this is not just some spoiled tantrum - its a mental illness question.  And yes perhaps your mom does not have the bandwidth to host an engagement party right now. But perhaps she should also cancel her birthday party if the situation is so dire with your sister. What\u2019s appalling is the \u2018leave fiance home\u2019. He\u2019s part of the family already. He\u2019s a person with feelings. He should be a support too for your sister not an obstacle. It\u2019s so wrong to cast him as disposable. I\u2018d back off on the wedding threats assuming its some time away. Again, right now your sister may be suicidal. Support your mom and dad but don\u2018t cave on the normality of fiance or the ring.", "NTA. And Congratulations on your engagement! (Since they\u2019re not saying it)\n\nI understand your parents asking you not to make a big deal about it in front of her. That\u2019s fair enough and would just be the basic human thing to do.\n\nBut you should be able to celebrate your engagement. She can decide whether to come to that or not.\n\nYou have done well to stand up to your family on this one. It\u2019s difficult to do, and I\u2019ve buckled myself before to keep thee peace (different circumstances but also to do with marriage) and kinda regretted it. \n\nWeddings are a pain in the arse. Someone is always offended and it often causes divisions in the family. It shouldn\u2019t be this way of course. It\u2019s yours and your husband\u2019s day, as is the engagement celebration. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise!", "I don\u2019t think it was wrong to ask to keep the engagement low profile for a few weeks but all of the other stuff if beyond ridiculous.   No you should not exclude your fianc\u00e9 from the birthday celebration and no you should not leave your ring at home.  Have your own engagement party with people who obviously support you no matter what.   Get married and live your happy life.   NTA", "NTA. Your sister is a spoiled brat but not your place to keep the spoiling", "NTA \n\nBut you are just as petty for refusing that they come to your wedding over how they treat your sister. \n\nAsshole parents raise asshole kids. Fact", "NTA.  Your parents' request is unreasonable even if it is for the supposed welfare of your sister.  Your sister needs more help than you hiding your ring and fiance.  You are fully within your rights to state you are a package deal, and that if you being engaged is so painful for your sister then you will just not be there are at all.", "NTA. This is a time to celebrate. Your wedding only comes around once. Enjoy every moment of it. It is not like you are rubbing your sister's face in it. There is absolutely no way I would hide my ring or my fianc\u00e9'. Canceling your engagement party is a terrible thing to do. Don't let them rain on your parade. Good for you going no contact. I would do the same with your sister. If they can't support you genuinely, then they have no business being at your wedding. This is your time, not your sister's. Her day will come. It honestly sounds like she rushed a relationship anyway.", "Nta. You shouldn't hide your life cause your sister can't control herself", "Love that you are backing yourself and your man. Good on you :) who needs family like that anyway, you\u2019re better off", "Nope, you are 100% right. \n\n\nThere is no difference between what you are making your boundary and what your father did for your mother, your sister needs therapy.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Fuck your sister dawg. She needs to grow up", "My first laugh out loud today!  Thank you for that.", "Thanks, I shot a noodle out of my nose reading this!", "I laughed so loud my cat jumped through through the roof hahaha. Seriously - nta op and your sister needs to get a life\nEdit to add: Congrats OP!", "Pretty much this. Not a direct comparison but my sister and her husband had a baby a couple of years ago who we adore. Me and my wife have been struggling to conceive for roughly the same time period. So on occasion it can be triggering but you leave that shit at home because it shouldn't impact our relationship with them and we would never dream of it doing so.\n\nThis is like us demanding they hide our neice every time we see them at family functions. The idea of it is absurd.", "This. If there are things you cannot mentally handle, you stay home. Your issues are yours, no one else's. The sister should skip the party if she's not going to be able to see OP and her fiance. It is nice to try to make things easy for someone who is struggling but it is not your responsibility. Sister needs to own her issues, but if she's spoiled and entitled she won't. \n\nAlso, as a rule if someone asked you to choose between them and a friend/family, always pick the person who didn't put you in that position. The parents are making OP choose between them/the sister and the fiance. She picked the fiance, as she should.", "I think ESH. It might be nice to have a little compassion for her sister. Whether or not you approve of her competitiveness, she was hospitalised with grief.\n\nI would hope my sister would at least show a little comparison. I think uninviting the fiance is too far, but I also think threatening to go no contact is as well.", "Did you see where the sister had to be hospitalized when OP got engaged, not when her ex got engaged?", "> If she had had an anaphylactic reaction to your dog and still unwell from it, you wouldnt then bring your dog round, would you?\n\n\nIt sounds like she would tbh.", "It's not even about OP's failure to compromise.  While that is an AH thing it isn't the worst part.  \n\nIt is the going absolutely nuclear and giving her own parents an ultimatum that she will go NC unless they agree they were in the wrong. That is just beyond the pale.  Even if OP thinks the parents are being unreasonable, they are clearly doing what they think they have to in order to support their child (and OP's sister) in a genuine and dangerous crisis - it is outrageous to give them an ultimatum and punish them for that.", "Bingo.", "Yeah honestly, imagine cutting your family out of your life over something so petty? Most childish 40 year old lol.", "I'm getting the feeling that OP doesn't mind at all flaunting the engagement ring and fianc\u00e9 in front of the sister. There seems to be a lot of jealousy between the two.\n\n> You ratcheting things up to nuclear level - threatening to go NC with your parents if they don't do what you demand - makes you an AH.\n\nAgreed. How about \"Fine, I just won't attend then.\"? Does OP really need to make a stupid birthday party the thing that makes her go NC?", "100% this. Great post.", "> And I told them they are uninvited from my wedding and we are going no contact until they tender a sincere apology and revoke this ridiculous rule of \"keeping a low profile.\" I also said if this standoff goes through the wedding we are going no contact for good.\n\nAlso OP had this locked and loaded and ready to go at the drop of a hat. Immediate full nuclear option screams AH.", "I agree with this.  It also matters when this happened. Did sister just get out of the hospital recently? It would be understandable that the parents are being cautious with her if she was just released as opposed to months later after she presumably has done some therapy and stabilized.", "After reading OP\u2019s first post, I\u2019m almost wondering if she\u2019s been looking for a reason to cut her family off.  It\u2019s clear she resents them all.  I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s justified or not because OP seems to be somewhat of an unreliable narrator (is the party in two or three weeks?).  \n\nI understand being upset that you can\u2019t do all the normal newly-engaged couple things that you\u2019re looking forward to.  But her sister\u2019s mental health is so bad that her body physically stopped working and she needed to be hospitalized.  If she\u2019s doing all that on purpose to steal attention away or because she \u201cneeds to win\u201d, then the sister should become an actress.  Idk if her parents have neglected OP and prioritized the sister like she claims (helping OP buy a car doesn\u2019t sound like they don\u2019t care about her), but I understand that they\u2019re in triage mode and prioritizing stabilizing the daughter that just got out of the hospital.\n\nAsking OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 to sit out one birthday dinner given the current circumstances isn\u2019t disrespecting the fianc\u00e9.  It might be misguided and unnecessary, but I find it interesting that OP hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about her fianc\u00e9 feeling upset or hurt by the request.\n\nAlso in the first post, the way OP went into detail about how much her mother has looked forward to doing Mother-of-the-bride stuff and that she specifically threatened to take all of that away and to never speak to any of them again, seems like overkill.  Her response doesn\u2019t sound like setting normal boundaries.  It comes across as twisting the knife under the guise of setting boundaries.\n\nMight be best for everyone if they all spend time apart.", "OP's post feels like she went from 0 to 60 immediately. Parents asked and she went straight to threatening to cut them off. This could simply be a result of OP's brevity, but if she didn't kindly call them out on their ridiculous request and give them a chance to recant, wtf.", "It's weird, I don't frequent this subreddit often but I see so many people so quick to judgement without trying to open a dialogue for a better solution. It's quite shocking and I sometimes wonder how experienced these people are or what their lives are like. Sure, the better solution is harder and requires time and patience but it's ultimately better in the long-run. My \"judgement\" was NTA but my suggestion was to speak to the sister and have some sort of heart to heart. I bet I'm going to receive many angry replies and downvotes.", "This right here.  This comment should be higher up.", "Definitely this. Also include the fact that their Mum (unless actually a specialised mental health nurse) is denying proper care by insisting she can provide it at home!

The parents should have got a hold of it years ago. I don't feel much sympathy for her or the parents. Just because she spent a week in the hospital doesn't mean she couldn't have been acting hysterical for attention. OP absolutely needs to live her life, because I suspect the princess will always act like this. And good for you weeding out the users and losers. Lol.", "All true, and she *already knows.* That's the gamechanger.\n\nDamage is done. Even though her reaction to her sister getting married was way over the top, it's over. Sure, a ring may make her not feel great, but will it trigger a second breakdown? Unlikely.\n\nNow that the sister knows there's no point in hiding it. There's no guarantee her showing up with no ring won't cause the sister to spiral into self pity anyway when she realizes everyone is coddling her.", "I'm just here to give a verdict based on the situation from OP's perspective. As for the sister, yeah I can see that, and I wish her the best of luck.", "Only if this is in America. \nMan that is super messed up btw.", "You are probably right that he was smart to not say anything at the time. He didn't want to divide me from my friends and I really appreciate him for that. I am very glad to know now, though.", "They were six years old when the friendship started ffs, sometimes feelings just happen and you have to move on. Not everything is a \"long game\"", "Yes, yes he did.", "I don't know about you, but I think pretending to be someone's friend for 20+ years on the off chance you might get to hit it is the very definition of \"being dicks\".", "God dam some of y\u2019all are psychopaths lol", "Correct \u2705 They created that monster. Best guess = 101st time.", "If people life that way they normalise really scary shit and often self doubt even in absolutely reasonable situations. Been there, done that. But since AITA didn't exist back then I let my poisonous family manipulate me into thinking my boundaries were unreasonable until I had a mental breakdown and went into a psych hospital.\n\nI would have posted several times a week back thern full of self doubt to find out if I was reasonable or going crazy. Took me several years of therapy and 6 months of clinical treatment to learn how to set boundaries and stick to them. My husband telling me was not enough, my therapist telling me was not enough, but group therapy and multiple people telling me again and again helped. That's what growing up with unreasonable people does to you", "I don't know, she sounds like a nightmare to be potentially married to.", "Exception confirms the rule! All the best to you.", "What kinds of things did he do?", "Might not be their intent. Seen a lot of people try their hardest to stay friends and they just can\u2019t do it, eventually they just need to move on for their own good and events like engagements/weddings help to trigger this sort of self-reflection. Maybe all those years spent with you were a special kind of agony/hell for this person who was in love with you but unable to receive your affection, and eventually they decided it\u2019s best to just go their own way.", "Man, I really want to feel bad for him. But all I can think of in response is [\"Congratulations, you played yourself\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0IPjZDoB9U)", "The direct example that led to me learning everything was during a group game where one person is a back stabber and you have to figure out who it is. I was the back stabber and he successfully convinced the play group of 8 people that I was not when they all knew it was me from the get go.", "Look if she was in an institute who were reluctant to release her. This mean that multiple doctors believed she shouldn't have been released. Why? The main reason as to why would be she was a danger to herself or others. \n\nI have a feeling there is a high chance she might remove herself with a gun, pills or razor blades.", "My question is this - sister already knows they're engaged. Just SEEING the OP is probably going to be enough to start something if it's going to start. The ring and the fiance might make it more, but... OP's not wrong to skip it for right now to give sister some healing space rather than agreeing with the parents' requests.", "I think not bringing up the engagement is reasonable. Uninviting the SO isn't, imo, as he has been around and to other family functions for a while now.", "No. It happened when OP got engaged. OP clarifies this in a comment.", "Did you do this one week out from institutionalisation when you likely weren\u2019t even linked up with health care providers yet?\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t see the comment below this because they blocked me after replying. If someone could let me know what it says I\u2019d be much obliged because it seems vile from the small part I can see.", "Yeah, idk where the line is here. I truly don\u2019t mean this in a dickish way\u2026. If the sister is still *so* unwell that seeing engagement rings or newly engaged people celebrating sends her over the edge\u2026 then it seems to me like her parents withdrew her too early and should have let her remain in the hospital, no?\n\nI don\u2019t mean that in an insensitive way at all, I cannot imagine how hard that choice just be for the parents. But if the adult child\u2019s situation is extreme to the point that people *outside* the home are expected to live their lives around this person, they really need to consider what is truly best for her. I think it would stand to reason that she\u2019s not ready to be immersed in the day-to-day of their lives and those of their extended friends and family.", "Exactly this. I\u2019m not excusing *her* behavior or justifying her jealousy. But her parents have every reason to be concerned and dealing with jealousy and entitlement is way better than dealing with a **dead child**.", "There is a big difference between being a bit sad and having been hospitalised. It would be difficult to be hospitalised without imminent risk of suicide or harm to others and I\u2019m assuming the former. You\u2019re acting like she\u2019s mentally well and just being a bit of an arse. You can\u2019t expect her to be rational right now and what are family for if not to help at times like this\n\nAnd she\u2019s already at the place so she\u2019s there without going anywhere", "Agreed: OP is not wrong to skip the party. \"If my fiance/partner/spouse is not welcome, then I will not be there\" is a reasonable response, even if \"your fiance is not welcome (this time)\" is also a reasonable boundary.\n\nBut she says her parents are acting like her skipping the party is the end of the world.\n\nI may be over-inferring, but I don't think she'd have gone with the nuclear no-contact no-wedding-invitation ultimatum had her parents simply accepted that she was skipping the party. Them demanding \"Your fiance can't come, but YOU HAD BETTER OR YOU'RE A BAD DAUGHTER\" sounds like the tipping point, or one of many.", "Just because you\u2019re an expert in one field doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an idiot in all the other ones. Wowowow", "\"Hey, babe, I'm finally moving in!\"\n\n\"To *my* house? Nah, you cheat on your partners, I could do better\""]}
