My mother never planned for my father to be involved in my life, but he insisted, and wrote and visited irregularly when I was little. When I was ten, I stopped hearing from him.

It didn't matter that my mother told me he was the problem, not me; I was sure I had to be the one doing something wrong. It took decades for me to finally figure out that he was the one who let me down, and I'm still pretty dented inside.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to say \"if you're going to parent, you do so consistently. If not, you know where the door is.\" You're doing this for your kids, for the daughter who already thinks her dad doesn't care anymore, and the son you want to keep from ever feeling that way. But since you can't *make* him stick around consistently, if you want to give him another chance, I do suggest speaking with a therapist about how to approach it with your kids if he continues to stand them up.

Those are still his children, and you can get accounts set up that have stipulations on who, when, and why money is withdrawn. They very much deserve that.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation and it must be hard but he lives with his mistress; you\u2019re not getting back together", "Oh\u2026. Honey, he left you for his mistress. He is delaying divorce to save himself money. It has been decided.", "File for divorce and get child support. Better to have the financial contribution. Those are his kids too if he\u2019s not gonna step up and be a parent the least he can do is contribute to them financially, use it for a college fund. \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to go a legal route yet\u201d - he probably should\u2019ve reconsidered abandoning his children and moving away to be closer to his mistress if he didn\u2019t want to go the legal route. He no longer gets the choice and you\u2019re being ridiculous for not recognizing that. He doesn\u2019t get to call the shots after being a shit partner and shit father.", "Who gives a fuck what this bum wants? Like, really.\n\nDid he tell you that while fucking his mistress in a different timezone or when he was neglecting your children?", "He is their father. He will be imperfect. However, if he is abusive then I agree with you.", "There\u2019s play therapy aimed at children.", "Play therapy if you got something like that where you are. Kids that young don't have to do the adult sit down and communicate therapy.", "Agree. And my heart goes out to OP", "Right. Take his money and save it for their future.", "This is a horrific take. Her telling him to step up will make him see kids as a chore? This would only happen if he has the emotional capacity of his children, and even then it wouldn\u2019t be her fault.", "That wasn\u2019t my intent, I was just trying to stick to the facts without getting into a fight. \n\nI see what you mean though, but at the same time if he gets upset at spending the bare minimum with his kids wouldn\u2019t it be better to just not spend time with them? I don\u2019t know what the right answer is here, or if there even is one.", "I'm not just talking about abuse. He left his 1 and 3 year old children to move 1.5 hours away with his mistress and is too busy for regular phone calls. And you think he should be forced to take half custody against his will? That's bananas. His kids do not deserve the way he would treat them.", "That\u2019s great info to know, TY!", "A random outside opinion from a child of divorce: we were supposed to see my dad once a week. He actually showed up maybe once a month. I'm 1000% glad that I had any relationship with him at all because I had a blast with him and we do text sometimes. My brother went the opposite way--he chose not to have a close relationship. And I would bet he's way happy that he got to make that choice rather than have our Mom completely cut off contact when Dad wasn't showing up much. Your choices here will have impacts on the adults your kids will become. Please don't prematurely remove the option of an occasional relationship.", "It was a bad decision from the start for the dad to visit his kids for a few hours and face time with them. He's not their uncle. He is their father. That means 50/50 custody.", "???\n\nWhen both parents want half custody, they should absolutely get it regardless of gender. But no judge in the country is or should be giving half custody to a parent who doesn't want it, or who can't or won't provide safe housing and supervision. That's not a thing."]}
