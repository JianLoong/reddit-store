It took decades for me to finally figure out that he was the one who let me down, and I'm still pretty dented inside.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to say \"if you're going to parent, you do so consistently. If not, you know where the door is.\" You're doing this for your kids, for the daughter who already thinks her dad doesn't care anymore, and the son you want to keep from ever feeling that way. But since you can't *make* him stick around consistently, if you want to give him another chance, I do suggest speaking with a therapist about how to approach it with your kids if he continues to stand them up.

I split with the father of my first two kids (1.5 and 3 at the time) in 2015. We finalized our divorce with our custody agreement in 2017. Initially, he was as hands on as you could hope for. He really was a good, involved dad for our kids. We shared 50/50 custody, which went well \u2014 for a while. Then he met his current wife and shit hit the fan. Our beliefs and values were polar opposites (I drifted away from a lifetime of church and conservatism and discovered what I actually believed, he doubled down and became borderline fundamentalist). His wife was immediately stomping on common sense boundaries left and right. It was horrible. The kids started acting out, exchanges were awful, communication with them was insanely stressful, I lived in a constant state of anxiety about what they were going to do or say next. \n\nI hated it so fucking much. I just wanted to raise our kids in a healthy environment, and an environment where mom is losing weight from pure stress and dad and stepmom are openly shit talking mom is *decidedly* not healthy. \n\nI got angry enough that I finally listened to my attorney and petitioned for child support. It\u2019s not for us, it\u2019s for our kids. I\u2019d shied away from asking for it before because he\u2019d been such a dick about it, he didn\u2019t think I had a right to his money. The court said otherwise. So my attorney filed the motion and man\u2026 They. Were. LIVID. I stepped back, removed myself from the fray, and let my attorney do everything from that point on. I didn\u2019t ask for any specific amount, I left it to the state to determine what was fair and accepted the judgment. My ex didn\u2019t get to say no, didn\u2019t get to push back about how I didn\u2019t really need or deserve his money. I mean, he tried via his attorney but wow was it fruitless and sad to watch. The money is not for me, dude. It\u2019s for your kids. \n\nAfter months of not being able to rely on when he would actually get me the money, I went with my attorney\u2019s recommendation to have the state handle things. Money was pulled directly from his paycheck and I got to avoid the awkward, occasionally ugly interactions when he (or his very bitter wife) would give me the child support.\n\nFast forward and it\u2019s 2020. Due to a handful of reasons, custody/visitation has been rearranged and now the kids are seeing their dad every other weekend. I\u2019m living with my then boyfriend/now husband. Pandemmy hits. The kids were with me when things shut down, so they stayed with me indefinitely. Their father made no effort (read: zero) to maintain meaningful contact with them, didn\u2019t even drive by to see them from a safe distance in his car. He called occasionally (I think?) but then it was revealed that his wife was pregnant, we didn\u2019t know much about what the virus may or may not do to a pregnant person, so he opted out of exercising visitation\u2026 for 9 months. Nine. \n\nFast forward and it\u2019s January 2021. Ex loses his damn job. His wife is from across the country (New England), she now has two kids in a state that she hates (Gulf Coast), so she wants to go home. Ex losing his job was actually great for her \u2014 he couldn\u2019t find a job locally, so it made sense to move across the country to live with her parents. Ex didn\u2019t say anything to the kids about him leaving until shortly before they moved. I was devastated for the kids because it felt (to me) like he was choosing his new family and abandoning them. \n\nThey left March 2021. He\u2019s come back home to visit once. At this point, he calls every six weeks or so. Every six weeks, he gives them an hour on FaceTime to let them tell him about themselves, their interests, their dreams. Then they hang up and go back to their lives. For another six weeks until their father decides he wants to talk to them again.\n\nI used to send pictures, I used to share updates about school, I used to reach out and just fill him in on what his kids were doing and experiencing. I slowly realized how very little he seemed to care about what I was sharing with him, so I stopped. In 2 years, he hasn\u2019t requested anything, so I decided I would respect that that\u2019s how involved he wants to be and just leave him be.\n\nMany days, I wish he would just leave us the fuck alone, forget us completely, so I don\u2019t get the gross feeling in the pit of my stomach when I see a text from him asking if the kids are available. It\u2019s like stringing them along. Fuck that.\n\nGet a lawyer, OP. Don\u2019t talk shit about your husband to the kids, get yourself a therapist, see what a therapist would suggest you say to your daughter when she\u2019s asking for her dad (they\u2019re some really fucking tough questions to hear, much less answer).

It\u2019s not your job to get between them if he\u2019s not abusing them. You can be the safe space and calm place, and that will matter. Will they be ok when they get older to find you had pushed their dad away? Normally kids don\u2019t feel that way at a young age. They want their parent regardless of how well their parent acts. If you establish a parenting plan you can get on a schedule that you expect him to stick to, that he agrees he can do. Consistency is best for the kids, but no family is perfect.", "NTA.

The thing that hurt the most was that he would make commitments and then cancel, or worse just not show up. It made me feel utterly worthless in the eyes of the only man I knew - and as a girl that is the sort of emotional damage which brings the predators sniffing round like sharks to blood. \n\nSo- my advice to you is two fold. First show your anger to your child- say yes it is a really unpleasant feeling, that you are angry on her behalf, that you don\u2019t think he should behave like that, but also comfort her that it is nothing to do with her that he treats you badly too- this last part is important. One of the most damaging things my mother did in an attempt not to alienate me from my father was always make excuses for him. Children see things very clearly: there is no excuse for shitty parenting and they have a right to feel hurt and angry. \n\nThe second is make visitation a weekend thing- like he has to book a hotel nearby for two weekends out of the month or similar. He has a new life, but he needs to understand that kids don\u2019t \u201cfit into\u201d his new life like they do in a married couple. He will have to make sacrifices of time and money (echo everybody else- he has to start paying) in order to keep a good relationship shop with his kids. This is nothing to do with you and all about him choosing to be a father before he\u2019s a boyfriend. \n\nIf he says he can\u2019t do the above then take him to court- let him say it in front of a judge- and then your children can never be gaslit you weren\u2019t a fantastically reasonable and adult parent. Frankly I\u2019m in awe - I wouldn\u2019t be nearly as nice.", "Don't even give him the choice. Rip off the band aid.

So it sounds like there\u2019s some blurred boundaries between where this is about the kids and where it\u2019s about communication between you and him. \n\nSo you need to try, hard as that might be, to detach yourself from him emotionally and set a schedule of contact between him and the children. Even if he only sees them once a month, you might not like it, but as long as he stays consistent then it would still be within the realm of reasonable. \n\nThis is very early on for you and you will undoubtedly still be grieving the marriage and the betrayal. Your eldest child is 3 which means you became a mother at the peak of the pandemic and then were pregnant when things were still up in the air with it all. Then endured discovering an affair with two under three and that sounds TOUGH. I hope you have emotional support elsewhere with someone you can speak to fully and openly, otherwise, ironic as it may be, it\u2019s too easy to revert to leaning on him - the cause of your pain - for that kind of moral support. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say you\u2019d be the AH for setting that ultimatum but it would be too rash too soon. It\u2019s extremely early and some sober conversations need to be had along with some firm agreement in place. Then you can see how that\u2019s being adhered to and act accordingly. \n\nIt sounds as though you\u2019ve been done very wrong. But the children need to know who their dad is and that he loves them.

IT\u2019s an awful situation and I applaud you for being such a great mum to your children. But if you want to support them and ensure you little ones don\u2019t feel so hurt and abandoned, you need to be strong: accept it\u2019s over, get a lawyer, and try to enforce visitation. You\u2019re being too kind on him and your daughter, in particular, is suffering because of this. He needs to step up and take responsibility.", "I hope you have a great circle of friends and family.

He is living with the woman he cheated on you with. If you don\u2019t divorce him, you are just going to be an asshole to yourself and your kids.

I know it hurts. I know you wish you could turn back time and make him the man you once knew. That he\u2019s still in there, somewhere. All of those feelings are normal - but they are poison. You need to love yourself and respect yourself. What kind of example will you set for your daughter? If he did come back - she\u2019s going to remember. She\u2019s going to ask.

He's being a deadbeat Dad and you are just enabling his behavior but not going through the legal routes and making the lines black and white.

But I\u2019m from Canada,  where child support is a Federal issue. We even have guidelines, where the amount of support is based solely on income and the number of kids involved And even if a parent signs away their legal rights to the kids, they still are legally obligated to financial support them. I understand the idea of separation and divorce is difficult for you right now, but don\u2019t let that fear and uncertainty stop you from doing what you have to, for your kids, if the end of a marriage is too much too think about, than focus on what your kids deserve and need.", "so he is with his mistress probably full time and not interested in his kids or u and ur waiting to decide if u divorce?? wow.  and who cares if he doesnt want to go legal route and not pay child support.  he has no freaking choice in the matter he will have to pay or get a warrant out when he defaults on payments long enough.", "He's not keeping his side of the arrangement.

Sometimes, people have kids prematurely, before they know what they want or who they want. I'm not defending him the slightest, I'm telling you so you know that you're not his beacon.

I\u2019d you don\u2019t go the legal route now (not just with child support, he could come later with custody arrangements etc.) you could be in a lot more hurt. Do not give him the opportunity to hurt you or your babies. Talk to a lawyer (without consulting him first). This man cheated on you and is abandoning his children.
