Normally, people try not to react, but given the apparent proximity and what actually happened, you reacted normally. He should have at least gone into a bathroom or something. He shouldn\u2019t have called you a b*tch but he was probably embarrassed. Most people when they are embarrassed react defensively, but he went to aggression. Not comfortable at all and sorry you went through that. That was so gross.", "NTA. Reacting with an exclamation does not make you the asshole. Obsessing about it seems related to your medical condition, also not AH terrain. His reaction was needlessly abrupt. A wry grin and \u201csorry, just needed to get the f*cker\u201d would have done just fine. He\u2019s the AH.", "NTA. Although your ongoing feelings about it seem anxiety-related, your initial reaction is totally understandable. That\u2019s disgusting AF. He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t vomit on the back of his head.", "Your reaction may have been louder than intended or your inaudible whisper was picked up by his freakish, bat-like hearing.  Either way, his reaction was WWWWAAAaaayyyy over the top.  When you do gross things in public, people will react and you deal with it.  He dealt with it by being an asshat.  NTA", "NTA\n\nThat's just gross. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. He's the AH.", "NTA. In fact he should do that privately and he is a gross AH.", "NTA. \n\nThat is unhygenic and gross.  \nWhat if it squirted out and hit you?", "NTA\nIf you\u2019re doing personal things like popping pimples in public, you need to be prepared to shock people.", "You did not embarrass him - he embarrassed himself.", "ESH. There are lots of reasons to keep up the social distancing. You just figured out one of them.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely nothing of your behavior was rude. But he acted gross and like an asshole.\n\nI hope you can enjoy the wedding.", "NTA. It's everyones business when you do something like that in public. At least use a bathroom.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA even though I\u2019ve had pimples form that I couldn\u2019t see (back of neck or on scalp), didn\u2019t know what it was, just knew that something itches/hurt and accidentally popped it when I scratched. He shouldn\u2019t have spoken to you that way. While you don\u2019t know that he was deliberately trying to do a public pimple pop, intentional or not, it\u2019s still gross so I don\u2019t blame you for reacting.", "YTA. Mind your own business.", "Both the asshole. \nHe should leave personal disgusting things private but you are justifying your overly dramatic reaction with the \"social anxiety \" excuse because you are fully aware that you went too far.", "NTA. This is one of those situations where you weren't an asshole at ANY point, until you brought that shit here and described it in SUCH graphic detail that I picture it in my mind on an otherwise peaceful Saturday morning lmao. I'm crying at how fucking nasty that dude is, and I feel really sorry for you having to go through that, I bet being there was 1000% times worse than reading about it", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's so nasty. I have had conversations with people, men mostly, that will carry a conversation while popping neck/jawline zits, making eye contact the whole time.

Popping a zit in public is really gross behavior.", "NTA I have social anxiety too, and I honestly would\u2019ve reacted the same way\u2014and dwelled on it days afterward. IMO anyone else who isn\u2019t a doctor or nurse would\u2019ve had a knee-jerk reaction like that; you didn\u2019t have control on such an abrupt reaction. Plus the odds of you two crossing paths again is near zip, since the US population is 1/3 billion. He could\u2019ve been classy about it, or at the very least not curse at you; he would owe you an apology.\n\nI would\u2018ve reacted the same way, and I\u2019m that person who loves watching pimple popping videos!", "NTA  that us disgusting behavior.  I love popping my own skin and my husband's but if I saw that in public from a stranger I'd probably vomit.", "NTA\n\nHE embarrassed himself. Though it's smartest to keep quiet because pissing off randos can be dangerous.", "NTA - that's gross behaviour from your fellow passenger. If he did it without caring for how it would be perceived by others then shame on him, but if it was accidental and he was unaware what would happen then maybe he would get a pass... right up until he swore and was rude AF rather than just apologising TO YOU! \n\nAlso, I'm not loving the blatant intimidation tactics - would he try and stare down a huge guy? Probably not. What a repulsive jerk.", "Thank you", "I would have loudly claimed to have been hit by pus after he swore just to embaress the guy.  I get maybe he didn't realize what was bothering him (though I doubt it if he was pinching) but you better bloody apologize for it.  I know I've had zits that sprayed, you don't do that in public.
