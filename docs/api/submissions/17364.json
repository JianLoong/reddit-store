The abortion could've caused more emotional trauma than she's letting on or it could've brought up something separate from her past.  Either way, talking with a therapist after something like this and what she went through is almost never the wrong answer", "NTA. She's not a mom. There endeth the dilemma.", "NTA\n\nIMO, to give a Mother's Day gift to someone who recently had an abortion would be rude/sick/tacky.", "So, my first guess when I started reading was that maybe she is pregnant and the hormones are getting to her or something and she just hasn't told you yet or might not even know herself...is this type of behavior at all typical for her? Has she been having any other mood swings or anything?\n\nHer body has just been through a lot; her mind has just been through a lot; and hormones be crazy! So, NTA - just sit and listen when she's ready to talk and see what she wants to do next. Just offer love and support and hopefully everything will be ok but maybe suggest therapy again (perhaps as a couple this time, it might help if you're there). Good luck OP", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s so \u201cme me everything has to be about me\u201d type of behaviour. Are you sure this is a relationship you want to progress with\n\nShe had an abortion by her choice. She can be sad and grieve. It doesn\u2019t mean she gets Mother\u2019s Day presents and why would she want a reminder\u2026. If you had gotten one I would put sensible money on the fact you would have been accused of \u201c throwing it in her face\u201d \n\nTherapy.", "You can still grieve an abortion even if its the right thing for you. I grieve mine, my unborn child had genetic mutations and although I wanted the pregnancy I ended it. I know plenty of women who didn't want to be pregnant but still grieve. \n\nI think you should sit down and speak to her.  Ask her how she is coping. Maybe the abortion made her change her mind. Or maybe it made her think of the could bes that won't be.\n\nI'm going to say NTA. but I have a hard time saying gf is an AH... it seems your gf is having some deep unresolved feelings potentially from this abortion.", "I've had anti-choicers tell me my abortions didn't make me un-pregnant, just the mother of dead babies. Idk, maybe it got under her skin? Hormones might be a factor, too. From experience, that sudden hormone drop is brutal.", "NAH. A lot of times women who have an abortion still grieve that loss. They might not immediately, because typically they feel relieved at first, but on holidays and days like Mother\u2019s Day that grief can come up unexpectedly for them too. \n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain\u2026basically she\u2019s just going through a lot mentally and emotionally about it, doesn\u2019t mean she regrets it just that she\u2019s still gotta process it. Just be there for her and give her time. Be that shoulder for her to cry on and let her know that you\u2019re there to listen and support her.", "NTA. If she regrets the abortion, it's way too late for that now and it's extremely unfair to blame it all on you since it was also her decision in the first place. You should bring up therapy or counseling to her again because this is unreasonable.", "Just because you don\u2019t want kids doesn\u2019t mean an abortion doesn\u2019t break your heart. It\u2019s a huge deal and a medical procedure, both of which takes an emotional toll. I think Mother\u2019s Day just triggered her and rightfully so. Give her some space, apologize even if you don\u2019t feel you did anything wrong. You both don\u2019t want kids, yet she was the sole one who went through a procedure. Give her ground for her pain. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a jerk, I don\u2019t think you understand the pain she\u2019s in. Plus the hormones are wreaking havoc with her. She probably just needs some time. Also please consider a vasectomy. They won\u2019t let her have a tubal ligation until she\u2019s much older, but they will let you get a vasectomy. Then neither of you will have to face this choice again. Be kind and as loving as you can with her, and emphasize your willingness to try to communicate with her to reach an understanding. I think the two of you could use a few couples sessions with a therapist to sort this out together in a safe place. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not a mother by choice so it\u2019s weird she\u2019s expecting a Mother\u2019s Day Gift. She can grieve and she can have space. But she should really get into therapy. This all sounds very misplaced and she should\u2019ve let you know she wasn\u2019t up for going to a Mother\u2019s Day celebration. She\u2019s allowed to grieve but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to lash out.", "If it wasn't for the recent abortion, I would say tell her you got her an invisible present to celebrate her parenting her invisible child.\n\nNTA because you could not have reasonably expected she would react that way. But because it might be grief or other emotional response to the abortion, do sit down and talk to her about it, find out where she's coming from, and listen.", "NAH. Just let her know you love and support her. Ask her what she feels is the best way to be there for her, if she continues to push you away. Just let her know you\u2019ll be there when she\u2019s ready. All you can do.", "NAH\n\nYou didn\u2019t know she was feeling this way - she may not have known she was going to feel this way.\n\nPregnancies and abortions are hard. They take a tremendous physical and emotional toll and even if it was the right decision, it doesn\u2019t mean it was an easy one.\n\nSorry if I\u2019m out of line, but from how you describe things, you may have provided practical support in terms of paying for the abortion and offering therapy, but you sound very cut and dry about it and it sounds like you may not have provided a tonne of emotional support. An abortion is not like getting a stitch put into your finger. Even an early medication induced abortion is physically and emotionally intense and it sounds like you don\u2019t get that.\n\nBuy her a small gift and apologise - you didn\u2019t do anything wrong by not getting a gift in the first instance, but she needs your support - say you didn\u2019t realise this was important to her and ask to talk about it some more. Work out what you can do to help support her.", "NTA for not getting her a mother's day gift. \n\nif she didn't terminate the pregnancy the first mother's day gift would be due next year. \n\nbut Y-T-A for not getting the snip!\n\nit takes two to tango so BOTH have to ensure that no conception takes place.", "You think a woman who doesn't want children can't grieve an abortion?\n\nN T A for not getting her a gift, but YTA for not taking into account the complexity of the situation.", "Completely agree with mom, she\u2019s obviously grieving, just because you paid for it and she doesn\u2019t want children doesn\u2019t change the fact that she had to go through an abortion", "NTA \u2026 your gf is DELUSIONAL sorry that\u2019s the easiest way to put it . She\u2019s not a mom ( abortions don\u2019t count sorry ) !", "NTA.  She may feel some kind of way but I don't know how she translated that into a mother's day gift expectation.", "NTA", "NTA I don\u2019t think you could win in this situation. She\u2019s mad she didn\u2019t get a Mother\u2019s Day present. Had you got her one, she probably would have been mad too.", "NTA. Agree with what Bold n brazen said about her not being a mom. She also agreed that she doesn\u2019t even want to be a mom. Agree with the other comments that say she may still be grieving, and she is allowed to do so, but it doesn\u2019t mean she can be an asshole in the process. And by asshole, I say that because she\u2019s ignoring you and not communicating anything, not even saying that she needs space/time to think about some personal things. Agree with the comment about her possibly having a change of heart after all that. Just had this thought\u2026could she be pregnant again? Could that have been a (terrible) hint for you to take a guess that she\u2019s pregnant again? And that\u2019s possibly why she\u2019s so upset? That\u2019s literally the only reason that makes sense as to why she would be THIS upset. She didn\u2019t even want to be a mom. But I think it\u2019d be productive to talk to her about the abortion, see if she\u2019s changed her mind about being a mom, see if she has regrets, etc. She definitely needs therapy and this is coming from someone who\u2019s been in therapy almost 10 years and im 23 and came from a pretty good family/home. Therapy isn\u2019t just for \u201csuper damaged\u201d people or \u201ccrazy\u201d people. It\u2019s like going to get a checkup at the doctor, just making sure your mind is in the right place, in good health. If it is, no need for consistent therapy. If it isn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay, there\u2019s help available, and work on your mental health until it\u2019s healthy enough to be independent!", "Reads like absolut fiction", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she insisted on the abortion and wasent presured to get the abortion by somebody else she made the decision to not be a mother and therefore has no right to be celebrated alongside the women who chose to be mothers, no matter by not getting abortions or adopting a kid,or who where forced to be mothers by unlucky circumstances and/or abortion not being an obtion.

However, I'm not aware that it's a normative thing to do because I imagine it would be extremely cruel to give a woman who had an abortion a mother's day present unless she specifically said that's what she wanted. Without *her making it explicitly, unambiguously clear*, it seems like a really mean, heartless, thing to do. \n\nIf it is about the abortion, then therapy might be something to insist on.

I live child-free, and I understand that she mourns.\n\nApproach her as you would approach someone who grieves.", "This! I agree NTA, but am curious if this experience has changed how the girlfriend feels about motherhood for herself. Someone who doesn't want kids, I find it odd she had such a reaction to mother's day, specially since OP says she has never behaved this way before. Either way, the abortion has changed something with her and she definitely may need some therapy to address it. She may have thought she was fine till mother's day hit, but clearly after this incident, she is not okay. I almost feel like NAH because she may not even understand why she felt/feels so hurt and though her behavior poor, even his own mom has some empathy because clearly something snapped inside of her. OP all you can do is offer to listen and support her like you have been doing. Hopefully she talks to you soon", "I can\u2019t imagine getting a Mothers Day gift for someone who just had an abortion would have gone any better- she could have taken it that he was throwing a dig that she ended her pregnancy. GF is being completely unreasonable here.", "That popped in my mind too", "I\u2019m having trouble seeing how the girlfriend is not an AH here. Even if this is related to grief over the abortion, which is just speculation, not something we know, demanding a gift on Mother\u2019s Day when you\u2019re not (and have explicitly stated you don\u2019t want to me) a mom, is AHish behavior. And as you say, even if she\u2018s not an AH for getting irrationally angry in the moment, refusing to talk things out the next day makes her one.", "Abortion is a very sensitive topic and also can be an emotionally charged decision; even the most child-free women, who are living in a society that very much links women's worth to motherhood, can have complicated reactions to it. On top of that, the gettogether the OP describes, a family having a party to specifically celebrate women who chose to be mothers, is very likely to have triggered such a reaction. And I find it more likely that this is what happened than, what, she is randomly pissed she didn't get an extra gift?"]}
