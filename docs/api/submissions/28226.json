He acknowledged that your son may be scared to come out with his sexuality while ignoring other issues that would be heavily contributing to his anxiety/mental health. To me that says that his therapist is potentially invalidating everything that is likely contributing to his mental health struggles and focusing on your sons sexuality, essentially only treating his sexuality as a factor and ignoring everything else.\n\nHis therapist is supposed to be a confidant, how can he trust his therapist if he (therapist) isn\u2019t behaving in a way that fosters trust? What if you or your ex were homophobic, but in a subtle way? His therapist had no way of 100% knowing that telling you and your ex wouldn\u2019t be dangerous for your son. The therapist\u2019s behavior was unethical, plain and simple. He (therapist) is not someone your son can trust, whether your son knows it or not. Beyond that, the therapist isn\u2019t acting like he understands how all these different things can contribute and build on top of each other. Seriously, what therapist outs a kid who they know hasn\u2019t come out to their parents? A bad one\u2026 and potentially a homophobic one. It\u2019s hard to know for sure, but I have a feeling that the therapist is way too focused on your son\u2019s sexuality rather than helping your son.\n\nLast thing, and I apologize in advance for the unsolicited advice, but I believe this is too important to not say something. Your son is struggling with bulimia, it may be too triggering for him to be participating in wrestling. It\u2019s too common for guys who wrestle to struggle with disordered eating due to the weight classes and how strict the environment is about weight. It may be a good idea to take him out of wrestling for the time being to get him out of an environment that puts so much focus on weight.\n\nMaybe you and your son could pick a new sport/activity for him to try that doesn\u2019t put so much focus on weight classes. Maybe he could try out martial arts, like Judo or something (not sure if they do the whole weight class thing or not). Maybe he could try out some types of art as a hobby, like acrylic paint pouring. I\u2019m not saying that the wrestling is 100% to blame for his struggles with bulimia, but it\u2019s an environment where guys tend to have higher rates of disordered eating struggles and is likely contributing to his relapse. Mix that with potential control issues, which would make a lot of sense in this situation, and it is a perfect breeding ground for eating disorders. He can\u2019t control his environment and has to make weight, it\u2019s too easy for that to lead to him focusing too much on controlling his weight.\n\nOP I\u2019m so sorry about all this. Thank you for caring more about your son\u2019s mental health than invading his privacy. Thank you for recognizing how messed up his therapist\u2019s behavior was and wanting to do something about it. Absolutely report it. Also please don\u2019t tell your son that his therapist outed him and please ask your ex to do the same. Your son deserves to be able to come out on his own time when he is ready. Just be there for him and let him know that no matter what, he is loved and has your support. He will tell you when he\u2019s ready, it\u2019s probably just too much right now. Idk what it\u2019s like with your ex, like if it\u2019s civil or not, but please talk to your ex about how the two of you can best support your son.

And breaking someone's trust like that can set them back massively, especially if their therapist is the one who broke their trust.", "Nope nope nope\n\nIt's the kind of thing that fucks you up severely actually because you put your trust in someone to keep your confidence and they broke it. You will never get to come out on your own terms. You will never get to feel comfortable in that. Especially heinous thing to do to a kid who is already experiencing mental health issues. I take it you've never been outed by someone well-meaning. You don't do that shit. Especially as a therapist, they should have known better. You work with your client to get them to the point where they feel comfortable coming out themselves. You don't take it upon yourself to tell someone that the kid isn't yet comfortable coming out to.", "I see, so you don't care about the health and safety of a 15 year old child? That's very unfortunate. I hope you manage to develop some empathy.", "Adults don't react poorly or emotionally to being told something they shouldn't be told, that's a highly charged topic, or **doing something illegal that involves their child**? You believe that, but you're wrong.\n\nThe therapist wasn't even smart enough to lead with, or frame it as a hypothetical, he told two parents, **the kid was afraid of them finding out exactly what they were told.**\n\nAgain, **kids die from this.**", "See that's ethical.  She tells the patient upfront, makes it crystal clear, complete transparency.  \n\nSomehow I'm guessing that wasn't done for the OP's kid.", ">In this case though, he can.\n\nSerious question: how? Where is that exception written?", "I understand the logic behind confidentiality. What I don't understand is under what law a patient who is a minor can consent to have confidentiality waived. A legal document signed by a child isn't valid without a guardian's signature, children can't enter into contracts.", "> they would have said that\n\nMaybe. Sounds like OP unloaded on the dude before he had a chance to say much at all. But still, OP is perfectly able to respond to my request for more information so I dunno why you want me to make up my mind before he does. I'm not itching to jump to conclusions when OP could just respond with a definitive answer, and I don't really understand why other people in this thread would prefer that I do.", "> the therapist would still be in the wrong\n\nIf the kid wanted the therapist to tell them, then cussing the therapist out and berating him for it is absolutely not justified.\n\nedit: Also, consider all the people in here saying it's *illegal* for him to have told the parents. If the kid gave permission, then it's actually *not* illegal and that criticism would be unfounded. This is a major reason that I feel this piece of information is relevant.", "I understand that you think so, thank you for your opinion on my concerns.", "That\u2019s a fair point about cameras. I just always feel that if you lose your temper, you lose the argument, and the dad was in the right, so I would hate for him to be seen as the wrongful party.", "Except it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the law, parents are subject to the treatment of minor children", "It matters because if he wants to bring it further, which he said he does, he needs to be collected and calm, not yelling and seen as the aggressor. The dad is in the right 100% but he needs to present himself better", "[deleted]", "It's under HIPAA right? From anywhere from 12 - 18 in America, Preteens/teens start to have the legal right to medical information and privacy which means that as a health care provider (mental health counts) as long as there are no dangers involved (OP's son confessing to suicidal thoughts/homicidal plans) or issues with OP's son's ability to function - like if he was severely special needs; he has the right to privacy and actually has to give consent to his father hearing about his therapy notes/sessions in detail or even beyond more than \"he attended and we talked\".", "> He kinda slyly told me and my ex that maybe he might be scared of coming out us\n\nThat alone lets us know the kid didn't ask. Therapist could have just asked a leading question to test the waters. \"What would you think, or how would you react if you found out your son was gay / hid a relationship from you?\"", "Yes it absolutely is. If the kid was having trouble telling them himself then the therapist should've suggested group therapy where the kid could tell the parents himself with the support of the therapist. The therapist was not doing their job.", "It absolutely is. It's a violation of trust and a major breach of ethics. Also, if the son wanted to come out to his parents, or even if he gave permission for the therapist (unlikely) then *he should have been there when the therapist told his dad*.", "I know how that goes, and 100% understand that. I've watched it happen, tried to stop it, and done it myself. Sometimes you just need a minute before you talk, or need to step away during the talk. The dad probably should have, but I can say I might not have in the same situation.", "Honestly, I swear when you're dealing with a stubborn inanimate object (jar not opening, lock catching, car not starting, washer not working, the thing not fitting.) cussing really does seem to help, let the object know how you feel, and get it to act correctly.  \n\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I couldn't get a wrench to turn something until I called it an asshole. Same stance, same amount of pressure, same tool, 2 seconds apart, but that nut flew off. \n\nThis is about 90% anecdote and 10% sarcasm, but I am 100% serious.", "> That alone lets us know the kid didn't ask\n\nYou assume that it does. \n\n> Therapist could have just asked a leading question to test the waters\n\nThe fact that the therapist *could* have done something different isn't evidence of whether or not the kid gave permission. Once again, OP can answer the question I asked so I fail to see why you want me to make up my mind before he does.", "> it absolutely is. \n\nI mean, no. It's really not.\n\n>The therapist was not doing their job.\n\nSo find a different therapist, but that still doesn't convince me that cursing this dude out was the right move, *especially* without hearing kid's perspective.", "A therapist telling parents something the client asked the therapist to tell them is neither a breach of trust nor a breach of ethics. And maybe the kid didn't want to be there when they found out. We don't know, we have no idea how the kid, the person whose feelings matter the most in this situation, feels about any of it. That's the whole reason I asked OP to clarify his kids feelings on the matter.", "The fact is the therapist was SUPPOSED to do something different because we have regulations and laws about this, and doing this breached trust and invalidated their credentials as a therapist.", "Bullshit. Therapy doesn't work like that. In no situation is what that therapist did even remotely ethical.", "> we have regulations and laws about this\n\nThe law is that if the client gives the therapist permission to release information then it's legal and not a breach of trust or confidence, which is why I asked whether that might be the case.", ">Bullshit\n\nOh well when you put it like that it totally changes my opinion. I guess you're right, the kids feelings aren't important after all.", "Which would have been part of the discussion. \"So your son is scared about coming out, and wanted me to talk to you **first**,\" or as soon as the dad started getting mad, \"Well **your son asked me to** talk to you about it,\" or \"I feel like I have to tell you because it's **effecting his health and an ongoing condition is getting worse.**\" Those are applicable reasons to do this. Nothing else is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince the son was actively telling the therapist he was afraid to come out to his parents, they shouldn't have been told. The patient let their feelings be known, and, it seems from the post, that the therapist went ahead anyway.", "Which would have been part of the conversation. Have you dealt with a therapist, or just general release of medical information, since HIPAA started existing inside the US?", "I'm blocking you now.
