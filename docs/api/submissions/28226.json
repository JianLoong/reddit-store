He's been in therapy since last year after me an his mom started getting a divorce and he wasn't taking it well.

I'm \npretty sure I've heard him making himself sick  and he's been in a bit of a funk after he quit talking to one of his teammates. After one of his therapy appointments I asked his therapist about my concerns and what I could do to help more if I felt cordon was sinking again. He kinda slyly told me and my ex that maybe he might be scared of coming out us  and he had a bad break up. Luckily Cordon was waiting out in the car and didn't hear that.\n\nI was furious not because my son is gay ,but because he didn't get to tell me himself. I cussed his therapist out on the spot and told him how unethical it was to tell me what he and Cordon had talked about and outing a teenager.

Depending on the parents this could have put his l well-being or even life in danger.", "NTA AT ALL!!! Oh my goodness, your son\u2019s therapist absolutely needs to be reported. He acknowledged that your son may be scared to come out with his sexuality while ignoring other issues that would be heavily contributing to his anxiety/mental health. To me that says that his therapist is potentially invalidating everything that is likely contributing to his mental health struggles and focusing on your sons sexuality, essentially only treating his sexuality as a factor and ignoring everything else.\n\nHis therapist is supposed to be a confidant, how can he trust his therapist if he (therapist) isn\u2019t behaving in a way that fosters trust? What if you or your ex were homophobic, but in a subtle way? His therapist had no way of 100% knowing that telling you and your ex wouldn\u2019t be dangerous for your son. The therapist\u2019s behavior was unethical, plain and simple. He (therapist) is not someone your son can trust, whether your son knows it or not. Beyond that, the therapist isn\u2019t acting like he understands how all these different things can contribute and build on top of each other. Seriously, what therapist outs a kid who they know hasn\u2019t come out to their parents? A bad one\u2026 and potentially a homophobic one. It\u2019s hard to know for sure, but I have a feeling that the therapist is way too focused on your son\u2019s sexuality rather than helping your son.\n\nLast thing, and I apologize in advance for the unsolicited advice, but I believe this is too important to not say something. Your son is struggling with bulimia, it may be too triggering for him to be participating in wrestling. It\u2019s too common for guys who wrestle to struggle with disordered eating due to the weight classes and how strict the environment is about weight. It may be a good idea to take him out of wrestling for the time being to get him out of an environment that puts so much focus on weight.\n\nMaybe you and your son could pick a new sport/activity for him to try that doesn\u2019t put so much focus on weight classes. Maybe he could try out martial arts, like Judo or something (not sure if they do the whole weight class thing or not). Maybe he could try out some types of art as a hobby, like acrylic paint pouring. I\u2019m not saying that the wrestling is 100% to blame for his struggles with bulimia, but it\u2019s an environment where guys tend to have higher rates of disordered eating struggles and is likely contributing to his relapse. Mix that with potential control issues, which would make a lot of sense in this situation, and it is a perfect breeding ground for eating disorders. He can\u2019t control his environment and has to make weight, it\u2019s too easy for that to lead to him focusing too much on controlling his weight.\n\nOP I\u2019m so sorry about all this. Thank you for caring more about your son\u2019s mental health than invading his privacy. Thank you for recognizing how messed up his therapist\u2019s behavior was and wanting to do something about it. Absolutely report it. Also please don\u2019t tell your son that his therapist outed him and please ask your ex to do the same. Your son deserves to be able to come out on his own time when he is ready. Just be there for him and let him know that no matter what, he is loved and has your support. He will tell you when he\u2019s ready, it\u2019s probably just too much right now. Idk what it\u2019s like with your ex, like if it\u2019s civil or not, but please talk to your ex about how the two of you can best support your son.

Being outed is one of the worst possible things, especially by a healthcare professional, who is supposed to be a trusted authority figure.

I wasn't questioning that. I couldn't think of a way to join the classes with making to sentence to long. \n\nThe therapist was  wrong to  even hint at what the problem may be. My opinion is that dad was also wrong to put the therapist in that position... he asked for information he wasn't supposed to have. He knew how therapy is supposed work.  The therapist had to choose to clue in  a seeming concerned parent  or prolong the kid's misery. So, according to dad, the therapist gave a strong hint, dad put 2+2 together, then got pissed when they asked to a riot cause. He would have probably been just as mad the person told him it was a violation of the kid's privacy and didn't say anything. Luckily, dad didn't seem upset the kid was nervous about coming out and feeling isolated. My biggest problem with the therapist wasn't the opportunity of the act itself, but not knowing how the parents would react. There wasn't any context for that in the post... did the therapist have any clue from previous session how the parents would react? We're they guessing? Was the kid nervous about telling family, they tell other family and eventually it is public.\n\nI doubt the therapist was going around outing the kid to everybody, but they were definitely wrong.

However, a therapist\u2019s session notes are not considered official documentation, they are for the personal use of the therapist to analyze the session in the course of either diagnosis or treatment. So, not included in the medical records that the parents would be entitled to see. \n\nWhat this therapist did was, imo, the equivalent of showing the parents the session notes.

There's no need to create more stress on cordon by letting him know that someone he was supposed to trust betrayed his trust.  His mom already did that to him.\n\nChange therapist if you want.  No need to tell cordon the real reason, can just tell him maybe this therapist isn't helping.\n\nI personally think OP was kind of an AH because he reached out to the therapist to see how he could help cordon, and the therapist gave him a hint.  Yes, the therapist might be in the wrong ethically/legally, but then OP shouldn't have asked.  How can the therapist advice him on his to help cordon without valuing\n\nI have a question on whether it's ethically and/or legally wrong for the therapist to do what he did.  Parents have a lot of power over their underaged kids in the eyes of the law, so I'm not really sure it's legally wrong. OP was obviously trying to help and may have been judged by the therapist to be accepting of a gay son, so I don't think it is necessarily unethical.  It was dangerous because the opinion of OP might have been wrong and he would've opened up Cordon to a lot off abuse and what not, but the intention was good.\n\nDon't think OP should report the therapist.", "Actually, your mom isn't that kind of people at all, because it sounds like she does NOT accept theoretical gay kids (even someone else's, like her best friend's).", "He was angry his sons confidence was broken, he was angry for his son not because of his son.

Do they lie and risk being exposed later? Do they tell the truth and risk robbing their son of that choice? Do they say 'everything you say in therapy is between you and your therapist, and because they broke that confidence to speak to me and I love and respect you, I want you to see a therapist who will treat you with the same respect and care.' and not bring up the specific thing they were told? Do they leave them with the therapist and have it revealed later and have this drama come up then?\n\nThe therapist has created a shitty situation that's ripe for conflict and drama by breaking confidence.\n\nBecause the kid trusts this adult, and as the parent, now you know this person isn't nessasarily worthy of that trust.
