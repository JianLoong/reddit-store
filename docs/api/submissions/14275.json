Death has a funny way of bringing up memories and feelings that were buried, and while it sounds like you have a solid support system, I found it really helpful when my father passed. It was also of great comfort when the rest of my family hounded me for not going.  \n\nIt may be beneficial for you to prepare yourself now with a set of rehearsed responses to common expressions of sympathy. People will say they're sorry for your loss, etc., and others will try to guilt you for not being or doing more X.

Your mum is asking you to pretend nothing happened. To forget their cruelty and bigotry, to ignore the difficulties they made for you.

I had chance to say goodbye to him and it is one of my most treasured memories.

The poor daughter loved her mother deeply, and this was obviously horrific for her and her wife to go through continually. They decided to go no contact for their own sanity. I'd often have to call and inform them of changes to medications, a fall, whatever since they were still her POA. \n\nWhen it was time for as we lovingly refer to as a \"celestial discharge,\" I had a heart to heart with the daughter. Her coming and providing comfort to her mother may end up scarring her for life. Imagine being bedside of your dying loved one and all they can muster out is Bible verses and their hatred of you because of who you love. \n\nSo you need to think about how being there may go.

If you believe this is a possibility, please don't do that to yourself. \n\nYou are not obligated to go. He abandoned you. He made this choice for himself and you years ago. There is no reason for you to feel guilt. You will feel it because you're human and it happens. However, I need you to reassure yourself that this wasn't your doing. What you're feeling is a loss of what could have been. The time for those what could have been moments is over. \n\nYou may want closure. Going when he is at the stage of not speaking would allow you to hold his hand and tell him how you feel while avoiding a possible scarring and traumatic finale to this part of your relationship. You could also write him a letter and have someone you trust read it to him if he is unable to himself. \n\nThis is your decision. I'm writing a novel, and I'm so sorry. However you have to decide what you can or can't live with. What is your worst case scenario with this? Is it worth your peace? What will bring you the most peace? Love yourself through this process. You're not selfish. You have to find a healthy way to turn that kind of thinking off. Breathe. Rely on those who love you to support whatever decision you make. People who love you will be supportive. Anyone calling you selfish is the actual selfish party. Asking someone to step up to the plate to be hurt, abandoned, and traumatized to make their abuser feel good is sick. \n\nThe daughter and daughter in law first wrote letters my resident read.

Dad\u2019s family made his death out to be sudden but that was one of many lies they told me. I received only several hours\u2019 notice that my father was brain dead and on life support. I chose to make the couple hour trek to the hospital because I wanted the closure of seeing him in person. While there his doctor presented me with paperwork to authorize his removal from life support; I signed it, he died a short time later surrounded by his parents, a few other relatives, and me. I don\u2019t regret going to the hospital to see my dad. \n\nAfter his death my father\u2019s family continued dishing out their lifelong toxic behavior to me, particularly from his sister and mother.

I last saw them 3 and 5 years before they died, no contact in that time. \n\nOne thing, the most important thing, was this whole thing caused was me entering therapy to deal with all my issues/my family issues.
