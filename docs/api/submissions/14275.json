I'll try to be as brief as possible but I'd like your objective impartial view on this.\n\nSome background info: I (34F) used to have a great relationship with my parents back in the day. I held a deep sense of love and respect towards them and my extended family. \n\nI moved away at 18 for undergrad, and hid the fact that I was gay from them until I was 22. That was when I was getting serious with my then-girlfriend, currently wife. My family disowned me and cut all ties with me back then. \n\nI moved on, married my wife (36F) and we have two kids together (7M, 5F). I didn't hear from my family at all over the years. Not when I had a tough time with work, not with any of our kids being born, not with me having a very bad motor vehicle accident, nothing. My wife has been my biggest and only source of support through these years. \n\nMy mother recently called me, told me that my father is terminally ill, and asked me to come see him on his last days, as a means to comfort him and myself as well. She told me I could bring my wife along if I wanted to.\n\nI said I really didn't want to see him, not after he ignored my very existence on the surface of this planet for 12 years. My mother told me my heart was made of stone because I was ignoring my dying father and she said all kinds of things trying to convince me to get there.\n\nI have to mention after the call, despite the rift between us, my wife helped my dad during the course of his illness by linking them to a few of her colleagues, though she didn't give them any professional medical opinions herself.\n\nI asked my wife and she told me she would do whatever I choose to do in the end. I feel like an AH for saying no, but I don't know if I can handle the situation at hand. Does this make me the AH?", "created_utc": 1680957512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fkrz3/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_terminally_ill_father/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, the guy ignored you for YEARS after you just... came out to them? If he didn't have the guts to apologize and want you back in his life when he was ok, why would you go now?", "NTA. This sounds like a case of him and your mom wanting to clear their conscious and say \u201cwe tried\u201d before your father passes. You don\u2019t owe them closure, you don\u2019t owe them anything! They haven\u2019t spoken to you in 12 years, because of their homophobia no less, but now that something bad is happening they want your support. They can lie in the bed they made.", "NTA\n\nFamily is who you consider family - not always blood.", "NTA. They disowned you. By definition, you are not related to them anymore. If they suddenly have a change of heart, well, too bad. You can go if you want to, but you are in no way or form obligated to.", "NTA. Your heart is made of stone??? Those assholes have ignored their own child and grandchildren out of spite and bigotry. Your dad deserves to die miserable.", "NTA- Unless he's going to apologize, there's no reason to go see him, and tbh it could be a ploy to meet the grandkids without having to apologize.", "NTA - They chose to write you out of their life. You do not owe them anything.", " NTA but OP you should consider how YOU will feel if you don\u2019t go. If you will regret not seeing your father before he dies, you should go. If you won\u2019t regret it down the line, and really don\u2019t want to attend, then don\u2019t. Ultimately, you must do what\u2019s best for you!", "NTA whatever you choose to do. But I would think it over. How will you feel when he dies? If the answer is not \"nothing\" then you can visit him for your own sake, not for his. \n\nDo everything and anything for your well-being, even if it means to meet people who ignored you for a long time, because after his death you can't have another chance to find your inner peace with him. It is not about him, it must be about you. So don't say 'no' just to show them anything, but don't say 'yes' if it doesn't serve you", "They disowned you and went no-contact for 12 years.  Now she says *you're* the one with a heart of stone?\n\nUnbelievable!  You are very clearly and definitely NTA.", "This is a relly hard situation, im going with NTA, but i think you should probably give another though about your decision so you will avoid regrets in the future", "NTA.\n\nThey threw you out of their lives for being who you are and now he feels guilty and wants to clear his conscience before he dies. This is still ONLY about him and what he wants.", "NTA.\n\nI am also estranged from my parents, though for different reasons (abuse and heavy favoritism towards my siblings). It is so hard for people who haven\u2019t gone through it to understand our perspective.\n\nYou do not owe your father anything. The fact that your mother has the nerve to call you after twelve years of silence to demand you comfort your dying father is appalling. \n\nTake time to think and grieve as you have the right to, but do not feel pressured to see him unless it is what you truly want.\n\nAnd since I\u2019m sure it may come up, either here or from your mother.\nNo, love. You are not a monster if you choose not to see him, nor are you one if you don\u2019t regret it.\n\nAfter all the ways my father failed to protect me from his second wife and participated in the abuse to appease her, I will not be seeing him on his death bed, nor will I regret it.\n\nHugs OP", "This is so tough. I\u2019m going to say NTA. I get that you\u2019re hurt and it\u2019s terrible how you were treated. But I do fear you might regret not going later.", "nta, don't let them gaslight you to see [him.to](https://him.to) ease his guilt", "NTA, I have not seen my terminally I\u2019ll father in over 25 years and have no plans to. Why should you go and provide him comfort in his final days when he has done absolutely nothing for you in years and made no effort in contacting you.", "NTA but if you think you might regret, go. An apology might be feel better than holding on to this. But no obligation after all you have been through.", "I think it's up to you to decide if you may regret not seeing him in the future, if they decided to just ignore you for over a decade, chances are you probably won't regret it. Don't let them guilt trip you into doing something you're uncomfortable with", ">asked me to come see him on his last days, as a means to comfort him and myself as well.\n\nCould have done this for any of the events you listed, particularly after the car accident.", "YTA. Even though you went through a lot of hardship with your father, it sounds like this is an attempt to make amends. He\u2019s dying and forgiveness is free, although can be difficult.

You don\u2019t own your father a visit. He made his bed.", "NTA. This is the consequences of their actions. Saying sorry after so long and not even giving some understanding to why you would be hesitant shows this is more about them trying to absolve themselves of their guilt rather than actually seeking forgiveness.", "NTA. It is your choice if you want to see him. He ignored you, so there is no reason to do it for him!\n\nBut if you think you want to say good bye. An end to this chapter or something like that, than go. It is one change to do it. So if you are not sure, maybe go, you can leave any time and you won't regret it someday that you missed a change to say good bye. If you know for sure you don't want to see him again, then don't go. It is your descission and whatever you choose you won't be TA.", "NTA. \n\nDid they know about your events? If they knew about the accident they are pretty hypocritical, as well as jerks. You do what you decide is best for you, and that\u2019s that.

Do what would be best for you.\nTo absolutely ensure against future regrets, maybe see a therapist (or yours, if you already have one) to talk out all your feelings and make sure there's nothing you'd get out of reconnecting before it's too late.\nIf the conclusion of that conversation is still \"they're shitty people and seeing them would make my life worse,\" then absolutely stay away.", "It doesn't make you TA. NTA.\n\nBut this -- as your mother pointed out -- isn't just about your dad. It's about you too and you need to be able to live the rest of your life with whatever you decide to do now. \n\nYou are gay and you have a lovely wife and family that your parents have no part of because they treated you so badly. But you are also the child who grew up beloved and loving them. At some stage you may wish to bring those two parts together and if you do, will the child have wanted to say goodbye to the father she loved?  I don't know -- only you do. But saying goodbye to the dying is as much about doing the right things for our future selves as them.", "All things considered, NTA. However, it's possible you might regret it in the future when you no longer have a chance.", "You're NTA\n\nHe's looking at you for forgiveness and closure,  and I'm not sure he deserves it.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to give HIM peace on his death bed when HE made the choice not to see you while he was alive. That's HIS regret. It belongs to HIM. It's HIS job to make peace with himself and the consequences of HIS choices.", "NTA. Your fathers heart is made of stone. You have been forced to learn how to heal from having an uncaring father. You owe your father nothing. \n\nHas he even apologized for how bad of a father he\u2019s been? For how he\u2019s treated you?", "Oh honey so sorry they rejected you like this. That was horrible of them and unforgivable. So sorry and I feel you in every atom of my being. \n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to go.

You have two options - you either go and possibly make amends or you stay away and will never know what would have happened.\n\nI would recommend you go - giving both of your parents the opportunity to possibly make amends and to create a bridge to reestablishing relations with your mother. Going gives them the opportunity to see what they have missed - to meet grandchildren they have not met - to know you are successful in your marriage. If you do go, I see two possible outcomes - they express regret or they continue to object to your life's choices. You will never know unless you go. \n\nIf you do go think ahead of the scenarios - are they apologetic, are they doubling down on dislike of your life's choices, etc. and be prepared to address those circumstances.  All too often people go into these situations without game planning how things might work out. \n\nBest wishes on whatever choice you make.", "NTA.  It\u2019s interesting How she asks if your heart is made of stone when theirs clearly was when they cut you off without a care in the world.  Very interesting", "NTA. Their heart is made of stone if they ignored their own daughter for 12 years for just being herself. They don't get to clear their conscience now before dying. But their feelings aside think about yourself first. Is there anything you would like to say to him before he passes? Don't carry 12 years of burden forever and unload yourself of any feelings you might have now and leave them forever.", "Nta.

He\u2019s only guilty now because he\u2019s dying", "Saying \"if she's a good person \" is a guilt tactic.  She can be a perfectly good person and not see him.
