Meaning that I believe very strongly that certain things should be avoided during pregnancy when possible. I'm not mentioning this as though I'm thinking of her as my patient, but I'm trying to be a friend that would speak up if they felt like their friend was putting a lot at risk... the question is did I overstep by telling her the possible repercussions.\n\nMy roommate and friend of 10 years, let's call her S (21), got pregnant two months into our lease. She told me right after she had crashed her car on our way to New Orleans and proceeded to drink heavily our entire week there and had led me to believe she didn't plan on carrying to term so I didn't say much. While in NOLA she also asked me to be the godmother.\n\nMoving on to the next month she has decided to keep the baby so I asked if she was going to continue heavily smoking both cigarettes and marijuana, and she answered that she was. She continued on to explain that just because she's pregnant that doesn't mean she should stop because her mom smoked while pregnant and she came out just fine. I took some issue with this because not every pregnancy is alike and adding risk factors to the pregnancy isn't wise, my mom also smoked with me and i came out premature with many health issues that stemmed from smoking. \n\nShe called me a narcissist as she took my words and twisted them saying, \"not every pregnancy is the same, its my body my choice\". While I agree, there is no way of telling whether or not the child will be affected or to what degree. She said if her child has medical problems that it's fine because she will take care of them, as if she gets to live her child's life for them (if i had the choice not to have come out with health problems i absolutely would choose not to). \n\nShe also stated she would not stop smoking weed and that she doesn't care if CPS gets involved, which is what really made me mad, because we live together. I have trauma from cps in the past and the idea of being interviewed by them gives me a feeling that bridges on a panic attack. She also truly belives that its perfectly acceptable to continue to smoke weed while breastfeeding and as long as she waits an hour or two itll be fine (its can take 6 days for the marijuana to leave breast milk).. She hasn't met with an ob/gyn, and is 4 months pregnant, and claims that the ob/gyn would agree that it's fine to continue smoking which is funny considering she continued on to say you're not a doctor so I don't want your opinion and in the same breath I don't believe in your science. \n\nI feel as though it would be different if I were expressing an opinions, like you should paint your babies room blue because he's a boy, but I'm not. I'm simply explaining that there are very real risks to her decisions and that the kid could come premature which could lead to long term issues for that child. I just feel like her reaction comes across as though she is refusing to look at things with anything other than rose colored glasses (I didn't say this part just thought it)\n\nAMA/narcissist for voicing my concern?

Generally, care providers run drug tests multiple times throughout a pregnancy and don\u2019t report people for using nicotine. They also don\u2019t usually report positive drug tests unless the baby is in imminent danger or is born with some substance in their system. \n\nWhat may helpful to communicate is the act of smoking itself has more risks that using a nicotine patch or gum. Smoking marijuana has more risks than using a tincture. It\u2019s the oxygen deprivation and chemical byproducts from smoking substances have a bigger impact on the baby instead of the nicotine or THC itself. Harm reduction makes a big difference when dealing with people who have addictions\u2026and nicotine is actually a tougher addiction to kick than many street drugs. \n\nI have a valid medical marijuana prescription for PTSD and have for years. When pregnant, my doctors advised switching to a tincture instead of smoking it. Any child I have with my husband has a 95% of having ADHD due to genetics and I was told it would be higher risk to the baby and myself to try to switch to an SSRI that could put the baby through withdrawals. All my babies were born healthy, reached developmental milestones, and the older ones who were tested have a higher than average IQ. With the most recent birth, CPS told the nurse not to call them again for a positive THC test on a baby that was full term, healthy, and had parents who showed no no red flags for neglect or abuse, who got prenatal care, and who didn\u2019t conceal the existence of the prescription\u2026and frankly, I was proud to be that case precedent in my area to ease the difficulty other women who have the same script previously had faced. \n\nNow, if your friend isn\u2019t getting prenatal care, you could worry a lot more.

I enterpreted it as you believing you must be right because you are a nurse. As a friend giving advise NTA. I hope she does better.", "You absolutely did the right thing. You gave her valuable and factual information and she decided to throw it out the window.  She will do more to that kid once born\u2026.because she already has little regard for the baby\u2019s health and safety. \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t mess up your credit over it but it\u2019s time to distance yourself and let her make the bad decisions. Just make sure she\u2019s not trying to make you suffer the consequences of her actions.", "Tell her how much asthma inhalers cost when you run out between the one covered by insurance. When you re pregnant what you consume (as you know) will affect the child. Before you move out Id make a snarky remark about how she always has the choice to give them up for their own good (and this may be too far so ignore it if you'd like)", "She's leaving because her friend has shown her what type of person she is, and there's nothing wrong with that. If she didn't give a darn, she could just say nothing, but she cares- about the baby and about how raising a child with medical complications is not going to be as easy breezy as her 'friend' seems to think. As long as she gives her opinion and then stops when met with resistance,  OP isn't the asshole. There's nothing wrong with distancing yourself from people who make stupid choices and act like they never have to grow up and be responsible.", "I appreciate this response! I know I need to be able to separate myself from this situation, but shes also always the friend to give input when i dont ask, so at first I felt like i was doing the same, until she called me a narcissist.. She honestly is the only person I'd probably be like this to, considering she wanted me to be godmother..", "Also, there is a difference between someone who tries and fails from time to time, and someone who is unwilling to even try in the slightest.", "Nurses can do that too.", "I feel like you didn't read my post then. The first thung i l stated that I was a student in nursing and that I was only mentioning that so people would understand why I'd be so frustrated by the predicament. I also added that I was specifically asking from the point of view as her friend of 10 years.", "In your case, \u201cgodmother\u201d will actually mean \u201cunpaid babysitter\u201d and/or \u201csecond parent/primary caretaker\u201d.\n\nGet out as soon as you can.", "Not to a room mate. And they can not give medical advise in the form of a put down, pretty sure they would be reprimanded for that. But this is a situation that arose outside of a medical practice. A nurse can not give a medical diagnostic opinion beyond that of the patients doctor.", "You're focusing so hard on the nursing student part and not the friend part.If she had an ob/gyn I would respect their professional opinion. But like I stated in my post there is NO doctor, even though she's halfway through pregnancy.", "She was talking to her as her friend of 10 years.", "so a nurse who is also someone's friend can't state one of the most obvious facts in the world that smoking and drinking during pregnancy can cause harm to their baby.... because they are not a doctor? this girl hasn't even seen a doctor throughout the pregnancy, OP is just supposed to leave her be to potentially cause lifelong complications for her baby?"]}
