I then told her that this was her daughter's coming out, not hers, and the only thing we could do was love and protect her the way we always did.\n\nIn my friend's defense, she saw what she was doing immediately, and realized everything was coming from the place of being a mom who was worrying about her kid.

Not wanting her to make those mistakes is totally fair. The only issue is that *getting a piercing does not mean she will make the same mistakes*. There is no causality there, so his assumed logic here is absolutely baseless.\n\nBesides, you're his brother. If you can't call him out on his silly bs, who will!?\n\nEdits: punctuation", "NTA.

I'd say NTA\n\nI honestly believe that your brother is seriously overreacting over a small nose piercing, especially when it's barely noticeable. If her dad wants to really freak out about it and make threats about kicking her out or whatever, tell her to get a clear piercing, he won't even notice that it's there unless he really looked.\n\nBesides that, she's 17 and if it's legal for her to get piercings, then he should get over it. She's a year off from being an adult, and she could've something 10 times worse.", "NTA, that's what uncles are for, dropping some embarrassing facts about parents that they didn't want their kids to know, especially if it exposes their own hypocrisy.

However, you need to let your brother parent his daughter his way without inserting your parenting thoughts for him in moments like this.\n\nUltimately, I think you should've had a private conversation with your brother, given him a chance to explain his side of things, and given your advice in that setting if invited. Parent-child relationships are so complex, it can be really valuable to get that sibling perspective (like yours), but in private where you're supporting your brother by giving him an opportunity to speak his side, hear your thoughts if he wants, and then make a plan of action for how he'll tackle the issue with his daughter.\n\nAgain, it's awesome that you care about your niece so much and you want to comfort her.

I recommend supporting both of them by taking conversations about how he parents her \"offline.\"", "NTA your brother was literally trying to control your niece and you reminded him he\u2019s made some choices about his own body in the past that we\u2019re similar. Having a piercing when your younger isn\u2019t something that needs to be a secret unless you want to be a raging hypocrite about it", "NTA\njust being honest lol", "I have worse scars from a breyer model horse falling from the top of a bookcase  and busting my lip than any of my facial piercings (none of which I have anymore)\n NTA, it's all about control and he is being a hypocrite.", "NTA \nWhy is pretending you were a perfect child and then holding your kids to that impossible and untrue standard the typical approach to parenting. I think teens especially would greatly benefit from honesty, tell them about the mistakes you made and how they hurt you and others around you. How you want them to have a better life and avoid those mistakes? \n\nBesides, perfect parents make rebellious kids", "LOL, NTA. Be the aunt who tells her niece all the minor scandals of the past. Everyone did things they regret, it's best to enjoy them later. Instead of trying to hide.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you thought about it first. It just came out!", "NTA lmao she\u2019s 17. He\u2019s being so strange and hypocritical over nothing.", "NTA. You're the cool Aunt and PITA sister! I got a good laugh reading your story. Tell him to suck it up. Lol", "I don't understand why parents lie about this shit to begin with. I tried different drugs when I was young. My kids have yet to ask me, but if they did, I'd be honest about my experiences because I'm not ashamed of it. It's all part of growing up. I'd rather they ask me for advice than just go off and do crazy shit without telling me because they think I'm gonna get mad.", "Nta. You made him much cooler in her eyes", "Aunts, Uncles, and grandma's get to tell all. It's our job. It keeps parents honest. Lol you are NOT the AH.", "When my brother was complaining about the length of his son's hair, I gave my then teen nephew his dad's graduation picture. His hair was the same length. NTA.", "NTA not your fault he\u2019s a hypocrite. Also acne and lots of other things leave scars, but people survive\u2026 haha I will never understand this argument", "No OP, but you should tell your brother he is beign hipocritical. The past should serve as a teaching tool, honesty is always the best route.", "NTA, he has a weirdly over the top reaction and is very hypocritical. A nose piercing is fine and considering she\u2019s nearly an adult, what can he do.", "NTA. he IS a hypocrite and you called him out in defense of your niece, who did nothing wrong. good for you.", "NTA. This reminds of when my SIL got a boob job and my MIL was shaming her about it and saying it\u2019s for vanity. And my SIL says something like \u201cdad knows all about vanity, right?\u201d My FIL has gotten eyebrow lifts and other cosmetic surgeries. That shut both my ILs up real quick. \n\nYour brother is being a hypocrite. Piercings aren\u2019t the end of the world.", "NTA. It's not your brother's body to criticize. I'd like to give you an award for being an amazing uncle.", "I\u2019m going with ESH as I feel you don\u2019t have a right to interject into his parenting, but the nose piercing is not a big deal. My dad always had a no shit in your face rule which I generally agree with, also she did it behind her parents backs. I get he\u2019s a hypocrite but it\u2019s more about the sneaking around and is it really that wrong for him to want to her to avoid the mistakes he made?", "NTA. Why is he lying to his child? Why not tell her he had his nipples done and regrets it and wants to avoid her making the same mistake?", "NTA. My relationship with my nieces is one of my favorite things. I know they appreciate having another adult in their corner who loves them unconditionally and without all the complications of parents.", "i\u2019m extremely wary of fathers/father figures who obsessively want to control their daughters\u2019 appearances", "Lol NTA, your brother was being a hypocrite.", "I was blessed with an aunt (moms sister) who was like you and spilled all the secrets. My mom has passed.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "It's literally just a piercing, who cares?", "As a person with a dad who lied about all the stuff he did to.", "why hasnt she shared the hamster ears on the penis ?\n\nor the dices ...", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nPeople oversell the presence of \u201cscars on your face forever,\u201d when well healed piercing scars (depending on gauge and whether or not there was an infection) are more or less the size of a freckle. That, and I know for sure my parents telling me \u201cno\u201d to piercings only made me more determined to get one.", "Exactly! This is the kind of stuff uncles are made for.", "Literally my favorite part of having a younger Sister in law is telling her all the shit her brother got up to when he was her age that she had no idea about. As an uncle, it's your job to rat your brother out at literally every opportunity", "Yeah also what the hell is about him not wanting people to know about his old nipple piercing? It's literally just a piercing, who cares? Are they super religious or something? And niece does what she wants with her own body, he does not get to police that. Daughter doesn't mean property.", "\n\nShe yelled at her youngest daughter for wanting a piercing, then mom got a belly piercing like a week later.", "[deleted]", "I heard this in Candace Flynn\u2019s voice", "[removed]", "Well what about the rapping? I think that\u2019s the worst part.", "He probably took the piercings out", "Lol.  They are removable.", "I\u2019m almost sad that I\u2019m the most tattooed and pierced of all my siblings so I can\u2019t rat them out to their kids.", "Agreed x 10. About this kind of trivial in the grand scheme stuff, it\u2019s our job to blow up our sibling\u2019s spot.", "However, no one got angry, he just laughed and threw his hands up, saying that was fair! So yeah, your brother is being ridiculous.", "Got them removed right before him and his wife got married my niece texted me though saying I need to find pictures for proof", "So the person who had to do prostitution to survive as a young adult is a hypocrite if they later don't want their kids to become sex workers. It's not being hypocritical when your opinions change over a span of multiple years.", "He use to have it but took it out not too long before he got married", "Not liking the piercing you willingly got on your own is not such a grand mistake you get to get upset with your daughter for exercising her legal right to her own body.", "Yeah, no, this is kind of goofy. It's all good and well to say \"Hey I got a piercing and regretted it, are you sure you want to do this?\" and maybe explain why, but it's another to just be controlling about it. It's not like the girl is 12, so it's kind of weird for him to care that much about a piercing.", "It's a nose piercing. My sister literally just got one the other day, and she's fine. OP's niece is 17, she's old enough to start making decisions like that if she wants. NTA.", "Sneaking out is dangerous. Getting a nose piercing from a (presumably) experienced piercer is not. And not allowing your nearly-adult child to get a piercing when YOUR YOURSELF have piercings is ridiculous.", "Finally someone who makes sense", "Lol she\u2019s not a kid. She\u2019s almost 18. She has a right to her own body, not her father, and if she wants to get a nose piercing it\u2019s not a big deal. Also, who says she\u2019s gonna regret it later on?", "A nose piercing is fucking harmless, the father is a hypocrit, and the kid doesn't even need his permission. The father literally doesn't matter.", "Bad parenting should always be interfered with.", "It doesn't say she lied to her parents. It says she didn't tell them. That's not the same. She obviously knew they'd find out since it's in her face, so there isn't any secrecy here either. It's just exercising her right to control her appearance. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "But the honest way of going about it is by telling the truth. \"I got a piercing at your age and regretted it\", it's the attitude that's the problem.", "If he doesn\u2019t want his daughter to repeat his mistakes then he should be honest and explain his reasoning to her. Instead he decided to be a dick and act as if he has some right to control what his daughter does to her body", "A simple nose piercing is completely harmless and a 17-year old is perfectly capable of making that kind of decision for herself.  OP's brother is being an asshole about it and needs to stop body policing his daughter on this issue.", "His wants dont matter though.", "It was completely legal for her to do so so the brother really is making a mountain out of a molehill in this situation.", "It not his business. He literally has no legal right to decide if she can get piercings. He literally doesn't matter and his opinions is worthless especially since its both hypocritical and flys in the face of the kids own legal rights.", "Bad parenting should always be undermined.", "Good Lord you sound like a humourless dude.", "I don't know why he got them pierced technically he let a friend pierce his nipples when he was only 15... Younger than my niece (didn't bring up those details to her) plus my niece got her nose pierced by a professional luckily bros never got infected and ended up taking the piercings out in his late 20s \n\nIt's somewhat equal I mean he was the one upset over a little stud in her nose when he had his nipples pierced I was just saying he had no room to talk when he himself had body piercings I wasn't trying to call him out I understand certain things you don't want your kids to know I think if my niece wasn't in the room he would have said that's fair I won't be so hard on her about getting her nosed pierced", "This is the kind of stuff uncles are made for.", "If she gets a piercing, and later removes it, she will be able to accept the fact that she can do it too. Nose piercings don't have the same obvious scars as cheek piercings, so I don't really get the problem.", "He WAS being a hypocrite and he needed to be called out. He has no business getting upset about a piercing while having piercings himself.NAT", "I am the \u201csnitchy\u201d aunt who calls everyone out when they\u2019re being weird like OPs brother.
