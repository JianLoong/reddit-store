I then told her that this was her daughter's coming out, not hers, and the only thing we could do was love and protect her the way we always did.\n\nIn my friend's defense, she saw what she was doing immediately, and realized everything was coming from the place of being a mom who was worrying about her kid.

Not wanting her to make those mistakes is totally fair. The only issue is that *getting a piercing does not mean she will make the same mistakes*. There is no causality there, so his assumed logic here is absolutely baseless.\n\nBesides, you're his brother. If you can't call him out on his silly bs, who will!?\n\nEdits: punctuation", "NTA.

I'd say NTA\n\nI honestly believe that your brother is seriously overreacting over a small nose piercing, especially when it's barely noticeable. If her dad wants to really freak out about it and make threats about kicking her out or whatever, tell her to get a clear piercing, he won't even notice that it's there unless he really looked.\n\nBesides that, she's 17 and if it's legal for her to get piercings, then he should get over it. She's a year off from being an adult, and she could've something 10 times worse.", "NTA, that's what uncles are for, dropping some embarrassing facts about parents that they didn't want their kids to know, especially if it exposes their own hypocrisy.

I would push for my kids to have only non permanent body alterations till maybe their twenties, and then if they still want it, go forward with your research done as to the side effects and social repercussions. If you show up with a thousand tattoos and piercings, people WILL perceive you differently, no matter what people like to tell themselves. \n\nThat said, you are NTA.

However, you need to let your brother parent his daughter his way without inserting your parenting thoughts for him in moments like this.\n\nUltimately, I think you should've had a private conversation with your brother, given him a chance to explain his side of things, and given your advice in that setting if invited. Parent-child relationships are so complex, it can be really valuable to get that sibling perspective (like yours), but in private where you're supporting your brother by giving him an opportunity to speak his side, hear your thoughts if he wants, and then make a plan of action for how he'll tackle the issue with his daughter.\n\nAgain, it's awesome that you care about your niece so much and you want to comfort her.

You can easily say, \"I did that when I was young, and it was a bad idea. I don't want you to make my mistake.\"\n\nNotice how the brother doesn't do that here?

My sister and I grew up to be punk weirdoes who got into trouble a bit too much for our own good, but at least we were given the street smarts to know what kind of trouble was alright and where the line was before you started ruining your own life or someone else's.

Even the way TA framed it, \"well, I wasn't thinking...\" makes it sound like an innocent mistake which means he doesn't want to take accountability for his actions. The truth -- no you were definitely thinking before you said it, you knew exactly what the consequences of what you were saying when you said it, and you just wanted to embarrass and undermine your brother in his parenting of his daughter for whatever reason. Is it because you don't have kids and think he sold out having a family? Do you wish you had a family and are bitter?

I know when I was 16, if my mom couldn't articulate an actual argument for her POV, then it was safely ignored. Like drug use is a great example. \"I did that and here's all the ways it caused me problems.\" That's a real discussion. \n\nThe brother here isn't doing that, likely because he knows that piercing ain't gonna have any negative consequences. Girl can take it out whenever. Jobs that a young person can do don't care either. Etc...\n\nIf he could truly name one way his piercing negatively impacted him, I bet she'd listen (based on OP's description of her at least).

If he had some outdated notion that it would affect her career or something at least it would be understandable but he said that he didn\u2019t want to see it on her face meaning his comfort > her autonomy.", "Yep, and it's not like the OP was wrong. NTA. He was being a massive hypocrite and giving his daughter out of proportion grief for something that's about the same as getting ears pierced when I was a teenager. I mean, it's incredibly common, and as she said, not permanent.

If OP's brother told his daughter that he's disappointed in her for doing it behind his back and shared his own experience with his piercings and how he learned from the experience and why he now knows it's not a good idea would have actually been more productive. \n\n\"My dad, for instance smoked tobacco and was an alcoholic before he graduated high school. Does that make him a hypocrite for not allowing me to do those things?\"\n\nIt would make him a hypocrite if he completely hid all of that from you and told you he never smoked or drank in his life and you shouldn't either. But since you're aware of what he did i'm assuming he was open about that and told you how it negatively impacted his life and reasoned with you that because of it you should learn from his mistakes.
