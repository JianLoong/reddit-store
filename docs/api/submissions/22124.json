I then told her that this was her daughter's coming out, not hers, and the only thing we could do was love and protect her the way we always did.\n\nIn my friend's defense, she saw what she was doing immediately, and realized everything was coming from the place of being a mom who was worrying about her kid.

Not wanting her to make those mistakes is totally fair. The only issue is that *getting a piercing does not mean she will make the same mistakes*. There is no causality there, so his assumed logic here is absolutely baseless.\n\nBesides, you're his brother. If you can't call him out on his silly bs, who will!?\n\nEdits: punctuation", "NTA.

I'd say NTA\n\nI honestly believe that your brother is seriously overreacting over a small nose piercing, especially when it's barely noticeable. If her dad wants to really freak out about it and make threats about kicking her out or whatever, tell her to get a clear piercing, he won't even notice that it's there unless he really looked.\n\nBesides that, she's 17 and if it's legal for her to get piercings, then he should get over it. She's a year off from being an adult, and she could've something 10 times worse.", "NTA, that's what uncles are for, dropping some embarrassing facts about parents that they didn't want their kids to know, especially if it exposes their own hypocrisy.

I would push for my kids to have only non permanent body alterations till maybe their twenties, and then if they still want it, go forward with your research done as to the side effects and social repercussions. If you show up with a thousand tattoos and piercings, people WILL perceive you differently, no matter what people like to tell themselves. \n\nThat said, you are NTA.

However, you need to let your brother parent his daughter his way without inserting your parenting thoughts for him in moments like this.\n\nUltimately, I think you should've had a private conversation with your brother, given him a chance to explain his side of things, and given your advice in that setting if invited. Parent-child relationships are so complex, it can be really valuable to get that sibling perspective (like yours), but in private where you're supporting your brother by giving him an opportunity to speak his side, hear your thoughts if he wants, and then make a plan of action for how he'll tackle the issue with his daughter.\n\nAgain, it's awesome that you care about your niece so much and you want to comfort her.

When she was voted president of the newspaper and I said I wanted to celebrate her accomplishment- she asked for a naval piercing. Easy, done. From my perspective, as long as her decisions aren\u2019t hurting anyone else and they\u2019re made with a clear mind, I fully support it. \n\nHowever, not every parent has the same boundaries or expectations. So while my parenting style might not align with this dad\u2019s parenting style, one isn\u2019t necessarily better or worse than the other.
