Why should I spend money for something I won\u2019t use, like ever?\n\n\nEDIT EDIT:\nI plan to bring in a couch now. My parents have an excess couch that my cousin is taking\n\nMy cousin will now have an excess couch that won\u2019t fit in his apartment.\n\nFree couch, but I will pay for transportation, however, much that cost is.

Who does it belong to once lease is up? Who gets to pick the brand and style etc? \nYou seem young so you should find something free or cheap in neighborhood groups.", "NTA / NAH\n\nYou're right, it will cause confusion if it's owned by more than one person. It should be decided who wants to get them, can, and that's their property they're allowing to share with the unit. \n\nOf course it's nice to have those things, but they aren't necessary.\n\nIf they're ok doing it together and decide among themselves, they can do that too. They asked if you wanted to chip in, you declined, they can't force you. \n\nMaybe this will lead to them deciding they don't want to live with you, because they'd prefer to live with someone who's willing to go in on things together, and that's fine too. \n\nConvos like these should happen before moving in with people, so everyone can be sure they're on the same page and getting their needs met.", "INFO.\n\nWhere do people sit in the communal area if there's no couch?\n\nNTA based on info.", "NTA.

If they want it they can buy it.", "NAH. But understand if you make a stink about *not* paying, they will likely also make a stink about you *using* the items. Decide if that\u2019s a hill you wanna go die on.", "INFO.  Can't you just contribute something else that they'll use and benefit from that's separate from the couch and TV?  When I moved in with a bunch of friends, I brought my own TV.  We then would search online to find free furniture like couches.  Just chip in to put a covering and you're done.", "NTA. My roommate and I used to solve this by each purchasing one of the items, and we had leeway as long as it met basic specs. Eg, I bought the TV and as long as it was a correct size TV, I got to pick the exact one and the budget. My roommate bought the dining room table, and I didn't HATE it but I also didn't spend any money on the damn thing, so whatever.\n\nMaybe you should just buy the rug and they figure out the other two because you care less and will always just vote \"cheaper\".", "NAH but.....

You can come to an agreement beforehand that you will initially split the cost but someone will buy/sell it back at certain cost when they leave. Or if someone will definitely take ownership, then you can pay a smaller \"rental/usage/depreciation\" fee than a full split.\n\nThere are a lot of things in life that you need to pay for, but will never fully utilize or you're really only paying for the option to use it.", "INFO Would op feel better if you all chipped in for a waterslide instead?", "id say gentle YTA, there should be room to compromise here without having to step so far out of your comfort zone, yes there are issue with co-owned goods but that can be hashed out by having people pick something their cool to keep or be bought out of, going i dont think i need basic living items shouldnt be your go to, it is a shared space its should at least be functional", "YTA - pitch in.  You'll benefit from it too and the home should be furnished.", "YTA\n\nIf you did not intend to participate in a communal living situation, you should have lived alone or clearly communicated that BEFORE others made the decision to live with you.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to propose another approach (suggest that they split the couch, and you purchase the TV but plan to keep it) but not OK to expect others to take the burden of making your home liveable.", "Gentle YTA. Since you'll benefit from these things, however little you use them, I think you should pay something. Maybe suggest an arrangement where you pay less, with the understanding you won't try to claim the item when you move out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
