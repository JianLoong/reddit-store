She had nothing to be jealous of, we\u2019re just friends, but I got it. I removed myself a bit, giving them space and hoping she'll feel more secure eventually.\n\nHowever, over the months, I\u2019ve noticed that she started changing her style. When I met her, she was dressing in very generic, run-of-the mill, high street clothing (nothing wrong with that) but slowly, she changed her style to a point where a lot of her clothes are the same as mine. Which again is not something super unique but distinctive enough that after a while, it became rather obvious.\n\nShe started copying a lot of the things I do or wear, my interests, my hobbies, I would meet her in the same classes (e.g. creative writing course or language course which she would join later on despite not speaking the language to required level). It was odd. She even dyed her hair and added extensions to have similar hair style I have (fringe and waist long, dark hair) which again, not super unique but add that to everything else and it gives me the creeps.\n\nI mentioned that to James but he dismissed my concerns and told me I am overreacting and am just being jealous of his girlfriend. Not what I was expecting but I let it go.\n\nI don't have facebook but lately, my friend, Sandra showed my Lauren\u2019s Facebook page and it was beyond creepy. My friends have photos of me on their profiles from various outings, etc. Lauren\u2019s profile photo looked exactly like one of mine, taken in the same place, in the same clothes, and with the same pose. Her other photos weren\u2019t better, one was taken in my house when during one party she must have snuck into my bedroom and took photos in my pjs with my parrot, another was taken in my attic (where my office is, I run an online business from home) pretending she\u2019s working there.\n\nI hate confrontation and I don\u2019t know if I even have enough ground to confront her or if it\u2019s all in my head but she\u2019s making me uncomfortable, and I didn\u2019t want her at my house.\n\nI met James for coffee and mentioned BBQ I was planning I have a pool and it\u2019s very hot, we live in southern hemisphere and it's currently summer) to which I invited a bunch of friends. I told James that he was invited but asked him not to bring Lauren and explained why. He again told me I overreacted and that I am just jealous. He called me an asshole for trying to put a wedge between him and Lauren.\n\nHe did come to the party alone but made sure to tell everyone how badly I treated Lauren. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me at all beyond calling me an asshole on his way out. He messaged me telling me that he was disappointed in me and thought I was better than that and why I couldn\u2019t be happy for him. I don\u2019t know anymore, was I really the asshole for not inviting her? Should I have sucked it up in the name of friendship?", "created_utc": 1672157537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwj68y/aita_for_not_inviting_my_best_friends_girlfriend/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
