This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.\n\nI remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.\n\nWhen we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.\n\nShe again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.\n\nWe get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.\n\nAbout an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:\n\n{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.\n\nI felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?", "created_utc": 1673566843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aeoi3/aita_for_bothering_a_woman_at_home/", "score": 4142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA.\n\nText - no response\n\nCall - no response \n\nDRIVE TO THEIR HOUSE AND KNOCK - no response \n\nContinue to knock until they answer and ask you to leave - demand to go in and find stuffed animal\n\nAt what point did you think you weren\u2019t the AH?", "Yes of course YTA. The wife\u2019s note summed it all up nicely, the world does not revolve around your family but you seem to think it does. Extra bad for not wanting to bother your wife but thinking it was ok to bother other people. There are a lot of reasons why knocking on the door could have been extremely disruptive. There are jobs where what seems like a short interruption turns out to be a much longer one because it takes a while to get back into what you were doing. Or she could have been on an important phone call or Zoom, and you made her look unfocused or unprofessional. \n\nWhat would you honestly have done if she worked outside the house and no one was home? Would you have driven to her workplace and loudly demanded her keys? Taken her hostage and made her come home? Or just be a reasonable person and try to find a way to soothe your child for just one afternoon? I think you and your wife had better find a way to figure this out, because I will be shocked if these people agree to do you another favor after this.", "YTA. As a parent with a kid who has a stuffed animal he can\u2019t sleep with I always make sure it\u2019s with him when he goes/comes back from any overnight visit. \nI\u2019ve also worked at home and just because I was at home it didn\u2019t make me available whenever someone knocked on my door. Leaving my work space for any reason outside of breaks would have gotten me written up. That\u2019s someone\u2019s livelihood. \nMy favourite saying is: a lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. You know this elephant is important to your son, you make sure it\u2019s with him before he leaves.\n\nEdit: darn autocucumber, fixed a mistake.", "Gentle and kindly, YTA. She told you to come back later and you didn\u2019t accept that answer. That\u2019s not cool, and it\u2019s not her problem that you forgot it in the first place.", "Seriously, YTA. Not a gentle YTA, or a sorta one, but a big giant one. \n\nYou sent your 4 year old to a sleepover in the middle of the work week with a friend because you needed help. Then you didn't check for this super special stuffed animal that you absolutely cannot live without but absolutely won't pay $50 for on ebay and you left it there. Then you called multiple times and when you didn't get an answer you rang the doorbell multiple times, then didn't take no for an answer when you were told to come back later. \n\nI work from home. Today is Thursday, and I'm over 40 hours in already. Today alone, I interviewed several developers for open positions, had design meetings with 20+ participants, and gave two presentations to senior leadership. Just because I am physically at home doesn't mean I am sitting around watching TV and waiting for my entitled friends to realize they've left their stupid stuffed animals at my house. \n\nYou owe them an apology, a gift card to a really nice dinner, and a sleepover where you take their kid and give them a break.", "YTA  \n\n\nShe tried to politely say no after not answering her phone, and the door immediately.  \n\n\nYou forced your way in on this poor woman, awful.", "Having two of a child\u2019s comfort toy makes things so much easier.

YOU are the other Ah.", "YTA She let you know not to do it again.  That is all you need to know.  In your friends opinion, what you did was not o.k.  Accept that for her, what you did was not okay.  Apologize.  Move on.", "YTA. It was YOUR responsibility to remember to check for sleepy dumbo when your son was leaving their house. \n\nSo, you messed up, then you show up at their house, and interrupt this person\u2019s work, and insist on coming inside. \n\nTheir text is completely reasonable. You owe them an apology. Just because your family is going through a rough time doesn\u2019t mean you can treat people with no consideration.", "YTA would the kid not have slept if you were lying beside him", "YTA   If she was working from home or online schooling she could have been in an online meeting or doing a time sensitive test.", "YTA. Your child needs to learn sometimes you can\u2019t have it all. Child is too spoiled", "YTA. She\u2019s working! It\u2019s her home. She told you No twice. Not sure where you work, but busting into her workplace and home is by definition, YTA.  Sorry you\u2019ve never adjusted your 4 yr old child to sleeping with different stuffed animals or at least, a duplicate Dumbo is a \u201cyou and your wife\u201d problem.", "You have absolutely no idea what you interrupted, basically forced your way into someone else's home and what, think it's fine because it's for your kid?", "YTA for not checking for sleepy Dumbo yourself when you picked him up. You reminded HIM to be more careful? He's FOUR and just had his first sleepover. You're the grownup. I'll also give a small yta to the other mom because yes, she's busy, but a crying toddler? She's got to be aware of the level of hysteria that ensues. She ate up more of her time by arguing. Read the text from you, find sleepy Dumbo, put him in a bag on the porch and text you back. Two minutes tops. Small yta because I don't know her job but that's really the most expedient move.\n\nI can appreciate being tired and upset and not wanting LO to be distressed and to take the pressure off your wife so n t a for trying to retrieve sleepy Dumbo (just love that).\n\nSend them something lovely with a heartfelt apology and sincere thanks for taking your son.\n\nI hope FIL recovers quickly and things settle down.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award!", "Soft YTA\nIt was rude to continue to ask if you could search for sleepy Dumbo even if you were quick after the initial \u2018no.\u2019 However, I can empathize with your situation. \nIn the future I would recommend having two sleepy Dumbos. Travel sleepy dumbo and home sleepy dumbo if dumbo is really that important for your kids sleep and your sanity. \nI do think that the other couple handled the situation well and perhaps an apology is in order.", "Yes YTA.  Not even a light one, I think people are letting you off easy in the comments. \n\nI work from home. Them not answering the door is your answer, go away.  I absolutely hate people like you who will just sit there and continue to ring the bell or knock.  Do you understand how rude that is? \n\nLearn to parent your kid", "YTA \n\nEven though I understand ur kid can\u2019t sleep with the sleepy dumbo and is upset over it, u can\u2019t just barge into someone else\u2019s house like that. You should always keep a backup dumbo if anything happens to the first one.", "YTA\n\n> I felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. \n\nSo you\u2019re both messy. Good luck to your kid lol", "Absolutely YTA. \n\nSeveral people I know work from home in contexts such as:\n\n\u2014- Teaching university classes\n\n\u2014- Providing mental treatment including 1:1 therapy\n\n\u2014- Presenting webinars for state government agencies\n\n\nInterrupting any one if these would have extreme professional consequences for the friend, now to be known as the *former* friend.", "YTA, because your child's problem is not her problem. You shouldn't have shown up without permission. Your child needs to be taught that these things happen.", "YTA.\n\nWere you raised in a barn?!\n\nYou don't insist on entering someone's home like that. She's not obliged to let you whether or not she's working, but you heard that and decided *fuck her work* anyway?\n\nYour wife is out of line, you *should* be embarrassed because you were behaving embarrassingly.", "YTA. They are absolutely correct: if they didn\u2019t answer your text, that should have told you that it wasn\u2019t a good time to come over. You shouldn\u2019t have shown up to their house without knowing if it was ok and you definitely shouldn\u2019t have insisted that they let you in. You showed great disrespect for their boundaries and their privacy.", "YTA. You called,they didn't answer. But you proceeded to go over there anyway,and stood there when they didn't answer the door. This means they are unavailable. She is WORKING. That is more important to her than the fact that you are going to have to deal with your son freaking out because you forgot his toy. That is YOUR situation to deal with,not hers. Your wife can be furious all she wants,it probably doesn't matter to them. They did you a favor. Then you go against her request and barge into her home at a very inopportune time because your 4 year old is crying. NOT HER PROBLEM. So,I'm sure it's not going to hurt their feelings to not watch your kid anymore if it means it gives you a license to totally disregard what they have going on in their life.", "YTA\nBIG TIME\n\n\nWTF is wrong with you? I would have told the boy to look for Dumbo and you to wait on the lawn and turned the sprinklers on. When working from home, businesses are VERY strict. I don't know if that's the case for her, but you could have put her job at risk. Also, you couldn't take \"no\" for an answer. Grow up.", "YTA\n\nYou don't come to my job and pull a stunt like that. Even if it's my house and I work from home. I'd have called the cops.", "YTA not only are you reinforcing negative behavior in your child, you were an absolute AH to the other party. Over a stuffed animal.", "I'm going to go with a gentle YTA. I sympathize with your kid. I had a comfort item like that growing up. (Still have it at 40)\n\nBut as someone who does WFH (NOT self employed) it has been 3 years and friends, family, neighbors etc STILL just assume that because I WFH that I can just do whatever I want. I can't. My productivity is monitored, including any time that is idle, even for a few minutes. We get a set amount of time designated per month to set to personal time for leaving the desk for short periods of time. If we exceed it, we get called out on it. I have had family blow up my phone in the middle of the day with \"PLEASE, call when you can!\" Like it's some kind of emergency. So I go to personal and call....\"You weren't answering your phone. Just reminding you to pick up that birthday card for your cousins party this weekend.\"\n\nShe was working and it's NOT as simple to just hang around for 15 minutes while someone searches for a toy. WFH jobs are back to being a luxury and not a necessity. If your productivity starts lagging, they CAN make you come back to the office full time.", "Unfortunately YTA.\n\nSuggestion: get a second sleepy dumbo that never leaves the house. That way when something like this happens you got a back up", "I'm going against the grain and saying ESH\n\n\nShowing up at someone's house without any responses to calls or texts is an asshole move, you probably should've waited a while longer, and you should start teaching your son to double check to make sure he has his things before going home.\n\n\nThe wife should've just spent the 30 seconds grabbing the stuffed animal from the room instead of arguing about it, and she should probably get used to parents returning to her place to retrieve lost toys or blankets since her kid is old enough to be having sleepovers in general.", "YTA and if it is so essential to his sleep you should really get a back up Sleepy Dumbo", "YTA. You don't show up at someone's house unannounced.", "YTA No shit you\u2019re an AH. These people do you a favor and then you end up harassing them when it\u2019s clear they are busy? If this stuffed animal is so important how can it even be forgotten? You messed up and needed to deal with it without involving and interrupting other people\u2019s lives", "YTA - First, I want to say I'm sorry for the difficult time with your father-in-law's surgery and hope it went well. That said, you can't expect your friends to drop everything and inconvenience themselves because of a mistake you made of forgetting your son's toy when you picked him up. Trying to text or call your friend about it? Fine. But, once they didn't answer you should have taken the hint that they weren't available. At that point, sorry... You and your son are just out of luck until your friend returns your initial message and he'll have to try his best to nap without it. An unanswered text is not an invite to drive over to their house unannounced (unless it would have been a *true* emergency like a forgotten medication that was truly needed asap). Sorry, but your son being upset over a forgotten stuffed animal, especially one you know will be recovered eventually, is not an emergency no matter how sentimental it is.", "YTA. My dude. Would you have barged into her office to demand your kid\u2019s toy? Because she was WORKING. That\u2019s what you did. Interrupted her work day. I understand that your world revolves around your kid. I even understand the special bell of a kid misplacing a beloved sleep toy. But nobody else\u2019s world centres around your kid\n\nYOU DON\u2019T INTERRUPT SOMEONE\u2019S WORK DAY FOR IT.\n\nYou called, didn\u2019t answer. That should\u2019ve been where it ended until they called you back.", "YTA.\n\nIf it's THAT big of a deal, have a second or even third copy of the toy.\n\nEven better, use it as a moment to teach your child coping and reasoning skills.\n\nYou shouldn't have gone to their home without express permission, and you MOST DEFINITELY shouldn't have pushed to come inside when you were told she wasn't available. You owe them a nice gift card to dinner, a night for you to babysit their kid, and a very sincere apology. \n\nWorking from home does NOT MEAN she has flexibility to walk away from her work. I worked as a therapist for several years, primarily on telehealth during the pandemic. If someone were to interrupt a video session with a client who is in their most vulnerable state for a STUFFED ANIMAL, I can't even explain how upset I would be. That is not okay. This could cost someone their job", "Soft yta. Think about this, what if nobody had been home? Would you have still demanded entrance to the house if it were empty? This was a chance to teach your son patience and being mindful of other's schedules.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. I see both sides. I once drove 40 miles one way to get blankie because my son left it at his aunt\u2019s house. On the other hand I also work from home and nothing bothers me more then friends or family assuming I\u2019m available for literally anything other than my job. You understand how you inconvenienced her. If a sincere apology from you doesn\u2019t smooth everything over then I absolve you of any assholery.", "YTA. Not only did you show up to this woman\u2019s house after her not answering your calls.. you also wouldn\u2019t take NO for an answer when she tried to tell you she was working and was busy. How would you feel if this woman ( or anyone really )showed up to your job while you were in the middle of working for something like this.", "YTA. You invaded her space and disregarded common decency all for your own benefit. You called. They didn't answer. So, you chalk nap time up to a loss and wait for the call back. You didn't leave his insulin at the friend's house. It is a doll. \n\nYou could have used this as a teaching opportunity but instead you showed your son how to be entitled and blatantly disrespectful. You do not get to disregard manners for comfort and then blame the offended party for your outlandishly selfish and lazy parenting.\n\nI'm sorry for your family struggles. An infirmed, elderly parent in the hospital is very stressful. I hope your FIL recovers well. But your family troubles are no one else's problem but your's. They are definitely no excuse to trample boundaries and impose on others.", "Yes, YTA. Honestly, how self centered are you and your wife? She didn\u2019t answer, she didn\u2019t want to let you in. She said NO. And you continued pressuring her. Both you and your wife are awful.", "Tbh her note was more polite then you deserved. You both need to learn some patience. YTA.\n\nP.s why were you so sure it was at their place?", "YTA - please call this couple and offer them your sincerest apologies and assure them that that kind behavior will NEVER happen again. This wasn't a matter of life and death - this is about a child's stuffed toy. There was a lesson here - your child needs to keep track of his items or deal with consequences. Instead, you swooped in, invaded the privacy of someone who did you a good turn and then because angry/hurt because THEY were angry.\n\nYikes.", "YTA and on the road to raising an entitled child, good luck when he's a teen and you finally try to say no or not now. You had a teachable moment and were beyond rude and entitled yourself, so yeah you're  a huge AH", "YTA. Read her text over and over until it makes sense", "Of course YTA. Everyone with children understands your situation, apparently you as parents don\u2019t tho. If your child is that attached to an item, it\u2019s YOUR job to keep track of it. The other mom is right, if they don\u2019t reply. You shouldn\u2019t show up like that. It was rude.", "YTA. Your wife is a piece of work too. Your kid your problem ESPECIALLY because they already did you a favour.", "You literally barged into her home office (if she was working) and instead of taking no for an answer and teaching your child how to soothe himself and getting the stuffed animal later bullied your way into her place of work. Of course Yta and she\u2019s right the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you or your screaming child.", "You were pushy, but you were stressed and have acknowledged you were in the wrong. Soft YTA. \n\nYour situation can be easily resolved with a simple apology to the woman. She was simply setting a boundary in a polite way because she felt uncomfortable or unhappy with situation. Escalating it beyond a \"you're right, I'm really sorry. I let the stress get the best of me\" has probably caused long term damage to your relationship.", "NTA. Look, I get that people get busy, and yes they did you a favor, but this was toddler who is already in a stressful situation having a panic attack. The whole \"barged in\" and \"world revolving around you\" language is gross and incredibly passive-aggressive, and it's not as if you took up a bunch of their time, If the shoe were on the other foot, that's exactly what they would want you to do for them.", "YTA but a generous gift card to a nice restaurant as well as a genuine offer to reciprocate the sleepover, in other words a very nice date night, might help smooth things over. An apology is also in order.", "I'm sorry everyone but OP is NTA. 30 seconds to answer a text, 30 seconds to open a door.", "I\u2019m going soft YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re dealing with a very stressful situation but as you repeatedly pointed out these people did you a favor. 4 is young to be without a favorite stuffy but things happen and you can\u2019t always give them want they want. Suggesting a different stuffy until the other could be retrieved. If they didn\u2019t answer it\u2019s because they were busy. Instead of respecting them you kept pushing. Apologize maybe a nice gift card as a thank you for watching your kid and offer to watch theirs so they can have a date night.", "[deleted]", "ESH or NAH - so borderline.  I\u2019d do anything for my kid.  I don\u2019t think it is a huge deal to knock (she didn\u2019t actually have to answer the door\u2026).  She shouldn\u2019t have sent the text but was probably irritated at the interruption of her work - who knows what her day was like.  But you should apologize - won\u2019t hurt you to do it.  Bring them a bottle of wine or something at some point or something. For something this stupid and that something unlikely to be repeated, no reason not to just pretend to think you are the bigger a-hole.  After all, they did you the favor.  This is just so silly though.", "NTA she could have fetched the toy in 10 seconds", "NTA. As her being a fellow parent, she should understand children. This toy is obviously a security item for the child and she should understand why the child would be distraught without it. There\u2019s no need or reason for her to be so rude", "NTA - I think that this woman was being difficult for no real reason. Sounds like it took a whole two seconds to find the elephant. She made a big deal out of nothing.", "YTA, along with your wife. Sometimes kids don't get what they want. Reacting like that will not help your son learn to regulate emotions. Be the adult.", "YTA.  I work from home.  I have a lot of conference calls that I have to be tuned into in detail.  Oftentimes, I am the one leading the calls, and if I am not, it is probably my client talking and I am actively listening. When people knock on my door or buzz my apartment and I am on a call that I cannot step away from, I ignore it.  Especially if they have already called and texted and I know it\u2019s not an emergency. The only calls that I actually pay attention to are from family. \n\nIf I were on a call and these messages came in and despite my not responding to the messages, there was a knock at the door that required me to step away during an important meeting - I would be pissed off. Incredibly so. \n\nAnd then you fucking pushed in. In her house.  After she told you to come back later If nothing else, even if you weren\u2019t TA up until then, that\u2019s definitely the singular move that made you TA. As if her not responding to messages and the door were not enough, her verbal statement of the obvious also wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nIt\u2019s also just not a good situation to have your child so attached to the doll that its absence cannot be explained away for a few hours. You could have told him that his friend asked to borrow it, or at the very least was looking after it.  Honestly, you should have and could have gotten more creative to avoid disturbing someone during the workday. And knowing how attached he is to it, MAJOR failure for not paying attention to it when you picked him up. \n\nI get that things were stressed, but honestly, this is all on you, from start to finish.", "NTA. I can sort of understand her being annoyed that you pushed it when she asked to you come back. However, she did let you in, it's not like you forced your way into the house. Plus the text is a huge overreaction  and much more assholish. \n\nIt baffles me the number of people who are saying YTA because she was working and that you could have interrupted her doing something super important at work. First of all, did you even know for sure that she would be working from home? Secondly, she could just NOT answer the door - why the hell would she answer it if she was in the middle of something that important? I ignore people at my door all the time lol. \n\nEven as someone who absolutely HATES it when people show up at my house, I still say NTA, so thats saying a lot.", "What a tortuous argument. Begone.", "I woulda done the same thing if my son (now in college) had left Froggie somewhere. Full Shirley McClain. GIVE MY SON HIS FROG.", "NTA. If they are parents they would get that your sanity and the ability of your child to chill rests on that silly stuffed animal. I would have likely done the same thing. It would have been super easy for either of them to answer the phone, take the 2 minutes to look, and put Dumbo outside so that you didn\u2019t bother them.", "NAH just get a gift for them and say I\u2019m sorry. Move on from this. Probably don\u2019t ask them a favor again", "NTA- grow up cell phone people! Guess what life was like before being constantly able to screen. People showed up on your doorstep and you had to answer the phone to know who was calling and what they wanted. Do you want to know the truth? People were HAPPIER, I refuse to be friends with \u201cjust text\u201d people.", "I totally get the woman\u2019s annoyance, but getting the stuffed animal seems like a bit of a small ask.\n\nAt least when you consider how it took her so much more effort and mental energy to 1) ignore your texts 2) ignore your calls 3) ignore your knocking 4) ask you to not come in 5) let you in anyway and 6) to compose a nasty text then to just grab the dumb Dumbo and leave it by the door.", "NTA.  That woman didn't need to be so nasty.  I predict this is the end of any friendship between your child and her child.", "NTA.\n\nIf a parent sent me a text about how important sleepy dumbo was I would have had that little guy hanging on my doornob and apologizing!", "Info.  What is the relationship between you and these parents?  Are these like friends of yours, or is your only real relationship that they are your child's friend's parents?\n\nI guess I'll say NAH or ESH.  You had a kid going crazy and you were trying to deal with it I don't think you were \"wrong\" as you tried calling, and not answering doesn't automatically mean anything.  At the same time, I understand them being annoyed as well.  \n\nI think you may have overstepped by asking to come in, but I kind of get it.

Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.\n\nI remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.\n\nWhen we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.\n\nShe again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.\n\nWe get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.\n\nAbout an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:\n\n{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.\n\nI felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I understand children having an emotional blanket/toy that they need, but sometimes, we're in positions where they either won't have them, or they'll have to learn they won't die without them. You could have literally driven your child around for a bit, and he probably would have fallen asleep in the car, and this toy could have been picked up when the couple got back to you. Your wife is probably stressed with everything happening, but she has no right to be mad at anyone, or irritated by their message. I was 17/18 when my mom was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and I watched her die a month after I graduated high school, and I felt a lot of rage, sadness, etc. I didn't snap at anyone though, I didn't expect people to behave differently, or give me their unlimited time, or expect them to be there whenever I felt like I needed something. Your wife is an adult, and it sounds like her father just had surgery, I don't like assuming so I don't plan to act like \"it's just a surgery,\" but I was still a kid basically when I went through everything with my mom, and I think she should be able to handle herself better than an 18 year old.", "Dude, you\u2019re totally the ah here.  \n\nYou showed up out of nowhere, wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and literally barged into her home.

It would have taken all of 2 minutes to answer or respond to the phone call, head to the room and put it out the front in a plasticbag. Was OP, a bit pushy about it? I suppose but he really wasnt asking much. I suppose a very soft ESH because he was pushy and she was difficult for no reason", "Right or wrong, FWIW I'd have done the same thing. I wonder how many declaring Y T A are parents. For example, talking about a teaching moment. To a crying 4 year old? You're not teaching them SHIT at that age. They are emotionally reactive little fireballs at that age. \"Teach them to respect...\" GTFO here with that. Let me tell you all about the times I successfully taught either of my kids something when they're bawling their eyes out. \n\nI'm done. (I know I shouldn't. I still try. I still get burned.)\n\nI know the panic. I've seen my kid cry so hard they threw up. I've felt I would rip my own heart out to make them stop hurting. I think what your kid thought is \"I am safe, my parents would do anything for me, I am a priority to them.\" (Peanut gallery please do ignore the 99% of benefit a child derives from feeling safe and secure and unconditionally cared for by their parents and focus instead on the 1% of negativity that COULD arise from an EXCESSIVE amount of that AND that is probably disproportionately affecting you right now in this particular, short lived, transient, fleeting, stage of life).  \n\n\"You should've checked before leaving.\" Right, because no parent has ever forgotten one of the hundred damn things you need to transport child from point A to point B. It's only you. No one has ever made that mistake. Should you have checked? Sure. Hey, shit happens. Slap on the wrist, not fall on your sword.\n\nAlso, hold up, question, did she see how upset your child was? And still work is more important? Is she actively in the middle of a life saving surgery? Jeeeee sus. Have some fucking compassion, and perspective. I'm telling my boss or clients or whatever - excuse me, something has come up, your quarterly numbers can wait, you're not gonna die, this will only take a minute.\n\nI also would be mad at you if I were the wife. Ain't that something. There's definitely a dynamic here of \"don't come over without calling\" that's become a HUGE thing recrntly. I get it, I'm that way. I'd be furious. I just think we all need to remember that is a CHOSEN thing to value, by the current generations, in this particular culture, not some universal truth carved into the sky.\n\nAlso. In my head I see another story -- \"...so I told him to suck it up, quit his crying, and deal with it. This elephant which means the world to him is nothing compared to having to inconvenience and disrespect someone for 3 minutes.\" Oh what a monster! That's abusive! Can't you just deal with the slings and barbs for a few minutes? Think of the children! It will scar them for life! (And by the way, yes, it probably would have. We remember emotions far before we remember facts. My son still remembers all the yelling and fear and strife from when I was bad at being a husband, and he was like 2.)\n\nThe fact that it was a woman who you steamrolled, and the feminist angle... I think doesn't play. Because, I'd bet hard cash money that you would've done the EXACT same thing if it had been the husband. So, it's a false differentiation. Let's be logical.\n\nIDK if this is your first child, OP, but if so, welcome to fucking parenting. When you are right, you're wrong. When you're wrong... still wrong. No matter what you do. This trend says you're doing it wrong. No, do this. No, like this. No this new research. Oh I heard. In the old country we. You have to toughen them up. No nurture and protect them. Teach them: Respect and listen to adults. Dont blindly follow authority. Dont get into fights. Stick up for yourself. Question things. Please just damn listen to me.  Welcome to parenting paradoxville. It's all moving targets.\n \nhttps://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/35/aesops-fables/648/the-man-the-boy-and-the-donkey/\n\nIf you've never made peace with the thought \"some people are mad at me but I know I did right by whoever\", ohhh, man, you're going to need to now. You are on the other side of the event horizon - it is truly UNFATHOMABLE to someone who hasn't crossed. (And I say this as a former \"intellectual\", oh I'm so goddamn smart, I know what I would do, I know what I would say, I'm so moral, I'm so enlightened, I know what I would do if i had kids...\" WOW did I ever get humbled. Thank God I got over that shit and just stick to \"don't be shitty\" and \"just try to be a good dude.\")\n\nFor a 4yo, the answer is different than for a 10 year old. For neurotypical different from neurodivergent. You make judgment calls and you never know if it was \"wrong\" or \"right\" (except, again, accept, you're always wrong!) Frankly the Western obsession with discrete binaries, yes or no, up or down, black or white, is goofy to me. Your choice had some wrongness, some rightness. As ALL choices do. Sometimes the least shitty in this dimension has some shitty in another. So it goes. \n\nTry to make it up to them. Do apologize. 3 times. And do it right: \"I'm sorry. I completely understand why you're upset.\" And then zip it. They know why, they saw, dont repeat. \"I'm sorry but\" is not an apology. Hold your tongue, but then watch THEM say \"well, your kid WAS very upset...\" Straight up sorcery. Cheat code for life.\n\nAnd if your wife mouthed off at them, first of all, completely understandable. Ok good now she also needs to apologize. And properly. Maybe it waits until she has the battery to be able to. (Though if she was just talking shit at home, that's different story. That's where you shut your yap, Aristotle, and take your spouse's side. Then watch HER say \"Well, I can see where they're coming from...\" Black magic.)\n\nBut if they still don't accept it, then accept that there's somebody out there who doesnt like you. Sometimes broken is broken. Take that L, on to the next. Look I'm not advocating being an insensitive asshole to everyone all the time, but sometimes, difference of opinion. Yet... the sun rises. They are \"right\" to feel what they feel, and so are you. \n\nYour 4yo is not going to remember the gender dynamics or crossed boundaries. All they will remember is \"Daddy is in my corner. I felt blue and then I felt yellow.\" Don't get me wrong; there absolutely WILL come the time to teach them these things, and yes they ARE important to teach. (Respect women? Respect boundaries? Boy, you goddamn better.) But.... just not right that second. The right thing, at the wrong time, is the wrong thing. \n\nWere you an asshole? Sure. You're a dad. This is NOT gonna be the last time. You have principles, priorities, values. Sometimes they contradict, and you gotta make a decision. Sorry soldier but your choices are be a little asshole to them or big asshole to your kid. Neither is great. Embrace the suck.\n\nI see why you made the decision that you did. I understand. I would have done the same. You did right by your kid. At the same time, you did wrong by the adults. I understand why they're mad. It would be virtuous to try to fix it. BTW at THAT point, more ideal conditions, calm, daytime, you can maybe try to teach your kid, see if he understands. (He won't. He's 4.) (But it is still your job to lead the horse to water. If you don't, now its on you.) If it resolves happily, fabulous. If not, the sun will still rise. All life is learning. Just take it in stride. Learn, grow, evolve.\n\nAnd keep track of your shit, will ya?", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NAH here. You didn't go about things the best way, for sure, but you had a child having a meltdown you were trying to keep quiet while your wife was distraught.

No one is that busy to pause their day for a few minutes to look for a toy.  Not answering texts/calls, I understand.  But she made the decision to be a gatekeeper vs a helper.

They have a kid too, they should have been more sympathetic I would have been pissed if I got that response from them too.

You shouldn't have gone over since she hadn't texted you back, but since you did, you shouldn't have kept knocking once no one could answer the door.

You essentially went to her office and paged her until she showed up to answer your request, which was a crappy thing to do over something that's not super urgent.\n\nOn the other hand, her text was over-the-top. Your FIL was undergoing surgery. She could have gotten her point across and asked you not to come over without getting the okay first without saying 'the world doesn't revolve around you' or calling it 'walking all over' them.

I would think if she was in the middle of something she couldn't be interrupted from, she would have mentioned that she was in the middle of a presentation or was talking to a client, and his behavior could negatively impact her career. Any mention of something like that in her text is completely absent. I would also imagine if he wasn't pounding on the door incessantly, she wouldn't have bothered opening it in the first place.\n\nI work from home a lot, and when I was moving out of my apartment, I'd have 24 hours or less notice that the landlord was bringing someone by to view the apartment. Other times, my neighbor would have his girlfriend over in the middle of the day (he was a college student) and would have very loud ...visits... It was super awkward trying to work and talk to managers under those circumstances, but sometimes life just happens. I'd hope to think that most people who either work from home or have flexible work schedules are learning to deal with that with some level of grace. \n\nIt would have taken her 2 minutes to excuse herself, text him that she was working but would leave the door open so he could come in and grab the toy, unlock the door, and go back to work. This woman is supposedly on friendly terms with OP as their kids are friends. Ignoring him and hoping he would go away wasn't very kind given that relationship. When I was little, I slept with a stuffed animal every night. I never left it at a friend's house, but I can't imagine my friend's parents treating my parents that way if they were only trying to retrieve it. I also couldn't imagine treating my friends that way if one of their kids left a toy at my place. I'd feel awful if I left them standing outside my door with a crying toddler because I wouldn't let them in. \n\nCould OP have made this a teachable moment for his kid? Sure.

This could have been resolved quietly and quickly without a fuss.  It wasn't a normal circumstance since you and your wife only had your son stay there that night because of a family emergency.

But she has chosen to answer it and then proceeded to say she's working and needs to focus. It's an odd choice of wording to say \"I need to focus\". This makes it sound like OP has interrupted her being in the zone or workflow. This is an assumption on my part which is why I go back to the lady could've chosen not to answer the door. Once she chose to answer it and Dumbo was quickly retrieved, it seems strange to follow up with a text saying \"the world doesn't revolve around you\" and you can't \"walk all over\" them.

There could be several reasons for this trend. \n\nAs archaic as it seems now, up until the 1980s most women stayed home, were able to keep the house up during the day while everyone was home and often didn't mind people stopping over as that was their only social outlet. \n\nNowadays, women are just as much in the workplace as men and kids are more busier with extracurricular activities and needing shuttled around or juggling daycare pickups. When my kid was younger and involved with softball, Girl Scouts and other clubs, as a parent working full time along with my husband, when I got home after a long day, the last thing I wanted was company stopping by unexpectedly.\n\nEven though my house was clean, it may have needing straightened up (at least to my satisfaction when I know company is coming), I may have had a meal on the stove which meant turning it off to see what the visitor wanted (I can't tell you how many times our dinner got cold because someone couldn't take the hint!), one of us may have not been feeling well, kid doing homework, I may not have refreshments to offer because I wasn't expecting company and will feel like a bad host, and I have a chronic health issue which causes extreme fatigue, being sick with the flu or COVID and looking death warmed over, or simply we just wanted to unwind, eat and spend time with our kid since life is so busy. Dozens of reasons too numerous to list.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've came home, after a long day at work and ball games, club meetings etc and didn't even have the energy to cook and grabbed takeout, get in comfy clothes (i.e. taking my damn bra off LOL) and hear the doorbell ring and wanting to just scream. I know the intention is not there but it's just rude to not call ahead, especially when you know someone works from home, or just got home from work/school and it's the end of the day when people go to their homes to relax. It's like damn, don't you eat dinner and want to see your family after a long day? \n\nAlso, \"dropping by\" unannounced means different things to different people. It can span from five minutes (cool) to over an hour (not cool, if I wasn't expecting you).\n\nPeople's lives are busier and each family is different. Just because you don't mind people dropping by unannounced doesn't mean the rest of us have to enjoy it. With cell phones everywhere now, it just takes a second to send a text or call ahead and ask if this is a good time to stop by.

It's a NTA for me.", "backups don\u2018t always cut it, especially if the toy is a bit worn out. i was very attatched to my stuffed animal and any replacement would have felt so hollow and strange. like, that particular toy was dear to me. you can\u2018t just replace it with one that happens to look like it. it\u2018s like saying \u201eoh I\u2018m sorry you miss your parents. they\u2018ll be back soon and in the meantime I found a babysitter who looks just like your mom!\u201c it\u2018s just kinda grim", ">If I missed multiple calls from the parent of someone who's kid I just watched I would call back because clearly there's a crisis\n\nThis was not a crisis. The friends are entitled to say when it's a bad time for guests to visit. Teaching children delayed gratification is important.", "Yes, but you\u2019d also be an asshole to disregard what they said unless you knew they were just home drinking beer.", "Got lost playing Calvinball", "I wish this worked for me.  My daughter has Tiny Skye.  We got a second one and she immediately knew it was different somehow.  So she gave it to her little brother, so now they both have a Tiny Skye and I just have to hope they don't get lost lol", "I'm willing to forgive op on this one just because the reason he needed babysitting was bc his fil was getting surgery. I'm sure he has a million other things on his mind, especially since he describes his wife as \"a wreck\" because of it. I'm not saying he's entitled to barge into her house during work hours for the plush, but this wasn't a regular pickup. I don't there's a single person alive who hasn't ever forgotten something important in times of high stress. Op is definitely TA but we should still have empathy for people going through a stressful time", "To be clear, you\u2019re standing by your position that not answering personal text messages while treating a patient demonstrates \u201czero people management/ professional social skills?\u201d", "If it was knit or crochet try Ravelry.com.", "My understanding is that the expletives were shared by Wife with OP only, but Wife did not tell the friends. Which is OK if Wife is overwhelmed and needed to vent, no harm done.", "If they had replied nows not a good time, it takes 1 button press, then sure op is an arsehole.\n\nNot replying is poor communication and poor communication leads to misunderstanding.\n\nSo yes i stand by what i said, the other side can stick their important job where the doth not shine.", "My husband naps in the car at lunch time after he eats his PBnJ sandwich. Yes, I married a toddler.\n\nBut seriously I am not a nap taker and envy his ability to sleep for 20 minutes and wake up feeling refreshed. It takes me an hour or 2 just to fall asleep. He also doesn't need a dumbo to sleep.", "So if you had an in-person therapy appointment, you would expect your therapist to have their personal cell phone in their hand and to respond to personal texts while you spoke?", "Just becouse he was concerned for his kid's tantrums he shouldn't get a pass for crossing someone else's boundaries. They are not friends or relatives. Woman could had been uncomfortable with distant acquitance roaming her house. That is not okay! That is AH behaviour.\nYou can make a mistake but you can still be an asshole for making it. Having a kid doesn't give you a magical pass for it. Especially when it wasn't even an emergency.", "If its in their office? No\n\nIf its at their house and someone is at the door, it really isnt the same. A little bit of tolerance in life can go a long way."]}
