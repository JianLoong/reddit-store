This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.\n\nI remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.\n\nWhen we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.\n\nShe again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.\n\nWe get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.\n\nAbout an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:\n\n{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.\n\nI felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?", "created_utc": 1673566843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aeoi3/aita_for_bothering_a_woman_at_home/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA.\n\nText - no response\n\nCall - no response \n\nDRIVE TO THEIR HOUSE AND KNOCK - no response \n\nContinue to knock until they answer and ask you to leave - demand to go in and find stuffed animal\n\nAt what point did you think you weren\u2019t the AH?", "Yes of course YTA. The wife\u2019s note summed it all up nicely, the world does not revolve around your family but you seem to think it does. Extra bad for not wanting to bother your wife but thinking it was ok to bother other people. There are a lot of reasons why knocking on the door could have been extremely disruptive. There are jobs where what seems like a short interruption turns out to be a much longer one because it takes a while to get back into what you were doing. Or she could have been on an important phone call or Zoom, and you made her look unfocused or unprofessional. \n\nWhat would you honestly have done if she worked outside the house and no one was home? Would you have driven to her workplace and loudly demanded her keys? Taken her hostage and made her come home? Or just be a reasonable person and try to find a way to soothe your child for just one afternoon? I think you and your wife had better find a way to figure this out, because I will be shocked if these people agree to do you another favor after this.", "YTA. As a parent with a kid who has a stuffed animal he can\u2019t sleep with I always make sure it\u2019s with him when he goes/comes back from any overnight visit. \nI\u2019ve also worked at home and just because I was at home it didn\u2019t make me available whenever someone knocked on my door. Leaving my work space for any reason outside of breaks would have gotten me written up. That\u2019s someone\u2019s livelihood. \nMy favourite saying is: a lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. You know this elephant is important to your son, you make sure it\u2019s with him before he leaves.\n\nEdit: darn autocucumber, fixed a mistake.", "Gentle and kindly, YTA. She told you to come back later and you didn\u2019t accept that answer. That\u2019s not cool, and it\u2019s not her problem that you forgot it in the first place.", "Seriously, YTA. Not a gentle YTA, or a sorta one, but a big giant one. \n\nYou sent your 4 year old to a sleepover in the middle of the work week with a friend because you needed help. Then you didn't check for this super special stuffed animal that you absolutely cannot live without but absolutely won't pay $50 for on ebay and you left it there. Then you called multiple times and when you didn't get an answer you rang the doorbell multiple times, then didn't take no for an answer when you were told to come back later. \n\nI work from home. Today is Thursday, and I'm over 40 hours in already. Today alone, I interviewed several developers for open positions, had design meetings with 20+ participants, and gave two presentations to senior leadership. Just because I am physically at home doesn't mean I am sitting around watching TV and waiting for my entitled friends to realize they've left their stupid stuffed animals at my house. \n\nYou owe them an apology, a gift card to a really nice dinner, and a sleepover where you take their kid and give them a break.", "YTA  \n\n\nShe tried to politely say no after not answering her phone, and the door immediately.  \n\n\nYou forced your way in on this poor woman, awful.", "Having two of a child\u2019s comfort toy makes things so much easier.

YOU are the other Ah.", "YTA She let you know not to do it again.  That is all you need to know.  In your friends opinion, what you did was not o.k.  Accept that for her, what you did was not okay.  Apologize.  Move on.", "YTA. It was YOUR responsibility to remember to check for sleepy dumbo when your son was leaving their house. \n\nSo, you messed up, then you show up at their house, and interrupt this person\u2019s work, and insist on coming inside. \n\nTheir text is completely reasonable. You owe them an apology. Just because your family is going through a rough time doesn\u2019t mean you can treat people with no consideration.", "YTA would the kid not have slept if you were lying beside him", "YTA   If she was working from home or online schooling she could have been in an online meeting or doing a time sensitive test.", "YTA. Your child needs to learn sometimes you can\u2019t have it all. Child is too spoiled", "YTA. She\u2019s working! It\u2019s her home. She told you No twice. Not sure where you work, but busting into her workplace and home is by definition, YTA.  Sorry you\u2019ve never adjusted your 4 yr old child to sleeping with different stuffed animals or at least, a duplicate Dumbo is a \u201cyou and your wife\u201d problem.", "You have absolutely no idea what you interrupted, basically forced your way into someone else's home and what, think it's fine because it's for your kid?", "YTA for not checking for sleepy Dumbo yourself when you picked him up. You reminded HIM to be more careful? He's FOUR and just had his first sleepover. You're the grownup. I'll also give a small yta to the other mom because yes, she's busy, but a crying toddler? She's got to be aware of the level of hysteria that ensues. She ate up more of her time by arguing. Read the text from you, find sleepy Dumbo, put him in a bag on the porch and text you back. Two minutes tops. Small yta because I don't know her job but that's really the most expedient move.\n\nI can appreciate being tired and upset and not wanting LO to be distressed and to take the pressure off your wife so n t a for trying to retrieve sleepy Dumbo (just love that).\n\nSend them something lovely with a heartfelt apology and sincere thanks for taking your son.\n\nI hope FIL recovers quickly and things settle down.", "Soft YTA\nIt was rude to continue to ask if you could search for sleepy Dumbo even if you were quick after the initial \u2018no.\u2019 However, I can empathize with your situation. \nIn the future I would recommend having two sleepy Dumbos. Travel sleepy dumbo and home sleepy dumbo if dumbo is really that important for your kids sleep and your sanity. \nI do think that the other couple handled the situation well and perhaps an apology is in order.", "Yes YTA.  Not even a light one, I think people are letting you off easy in the comments. \n\nI work from home. Them not answering the door is your answer, go away.  I absolutely hate people like you who will just sit there and continue to ring the bell or knock.  Do you understand how rude that is? \n\nLearn to parent your kid", "YTA \n\nEven though I understand ur kid can\u2019t sleep with the sleepy dumbo and is upset over it, u can\u2019t just barge into someone else\u2019s house like that. You should always keep a backup dumbo if anything happens to the first one.", "YTA\n\n> I felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. \n\nSo you\u2019re both messy. Good luck to your kid lol", "Absolutely YTA. \n\nSeveral people I know work from home in contexts such as:\n\n\u2014- Teaching university classes\n\n\u2014- Providing mental treatment including 1:1 therapy\n\n\u2014- Presenting webinars for state government agencies\n\n\nInterrupting any one if these would have extreme professional consequences for the friend, now to be known as the *former* friend.", "YTA, because your child's problem is not her problem. You shouldn't have shown up without permission. Your child needs to be taught that these things happen.", "YTA.\n\nWere you raised in a barn?!\n\nYou don't insist on entering someone's home like that. She's not obliged to let you whether or not she's working, but you heard that and decided *fuck her work* anyway?\n\nYour wife is out of line, you *should* be embarrassed because you were behaving embarrassingly.", "YTA. They are absolutely correct: if they didn\u2019t answer your text, that should have told you that it wasn\u2019t a good time to come over. You shouldn\u2019t have shown up to their house without knowing if it was ok and you definitely shouldn\u2019t have insisted that they let you in. You showed great disrespect for their boundaries and their privacy.", "YTA. You called,they didn't answer. But you proceeded to go over there anyway,and stood there when they didn't answer the door. This means they are unavailable. She is WORKING. That is more important to her than the fact that you are going to have to deal with your son freaking out because you forgot his toy. That is YOUR situation to deal with,not hers. Your wife can be furious all she wants,it probably doesn't matter to them. They did you a favor. Then you go against her request and barge into her home at a very inopportune time because your 4 year old is crying. NOT HER PROBLEM. So,I'm sure it's not going to hurt their feelings to not watch your kid anymore if it means it gives you a license to totally disregard what they have going on in their life.", "YTA\nBIG TIME\n\n\nWTF is wrong with you? I would have told the boy to look for Dumbo and you to wait on the lawn and turned the sprinklers on. When working from home, businesses are VERY strict. I don't know if that's the case for her, but you could have put her job at risk. Also, you couldn't take \"no\" for an answer. Grow up.", "YTA\n\nYou don't come to my job and pull a stunt like that. Even if it's my house and I work from home. I'd have called the cops.", "YTA not only are you reinforcing negative behavior in your child, you were an absolute AH to the other party. Over a stuffed animal.", "I'm going to go with a gentle YTA. I sympathize with your kid. I had a comfort item like that growing up. (Still have it at 40)\n\nBut as someone who does WFH (NOT self employed) it has been 3 years and friends, family, neighbors etc STILL just assume that because I WFH that I can just do whatever I want. I can't. My productivity is monitored, including any time that is idle, even for a few minutes. We get a set amount of time designated per month to set to personal time for leaving the desk for short periods of time. If we exceed it, we get called out on it. I have had family blow up my phone in the middle of the day with \"PLEASE, call when you can!\" Like it's some kind of emergency. So I go to personal and call....\"You weren't answering your phone. Just reminding you to pick up that birthday card for your cousins party this weekend.\"\n\nShe was working and it's NOT as simple to just hang around for 15 minutes while someone searches for a toy. WFH jobs are back to being a luxury and not a necessity. If your productivity starts lagging, they CAN make you come back to the office full time.", "Unfortunately YTA.\n\nSuggestion: get a second sleepy dumbo that never leaves the house. That way when something like this happens you got a back up", "I'm going against the grain and saying ESH\n\n\nShowing up at someone's house without any responses to calls or texts is an asshole move, you probably should've waited a while longer, and you should start teaching your son to double check to make sure he has his things before going home.\n\n\nThe wife should've just spent the 30 seconds grabbing the stuffed animal from the room instead of arguing about it, and she should probably get used to parents returning to her place to retrieve lost toys or blankets since her kid is old enough to be having sleepovers in general.", "YTA and if it is so essential to his sleep you should really get a back up Sleepy Dumbo", "YTA. You don't show up at someone's house unannounced.", "YTA No shit you\u2019re an AH. These people do you a favor and then you end up harassing them when it\u2019s clear they are busy? If this stuffed animal is so important how can it even be forgotten? You messed up and needed to deal with it without involving and interrupting other people\u2019s lives", "YTA - First, I want to say I'm sorry for the difficult time with your father-in-law's surgery and hope it went well. That said, you can't expect your friends to drop everything and inconvenience themselves because of a mistake you made of forgetting your son's toy when you picked him up. Trying to text or call your friend about it? Fine. But, once they didn't answer you should have taken the hint that they weren't available. At that point, sorry... You and your son are just out of luck until your friend returns your initial message and he'll have to try his best to nap without it. An unanswered text is not an invite to drive over to their house unannounced (unless it would have been a *true* emergency like a forgotten medication that was truly needed asap). Sorry, but your son being upset over a forgotten stuffed animal, especially one you know will be recovered eventually, is not an emergency no matter how sentimental it is.", "YTA. My dude. Would you have barged into her office to demand your kid\u2019s toy? Because she was WORKING. That\u2019s what you did. Interrupted her work day. I understand that your world revolves around your kid. I even understand the special bell of a kid misplacing a beloved sleep toy. But nobody else\u2019s world centres around your kid\n\nYOU DON\u2019T INTERRUPT SOMEONE\u2019S WORK DAY FOR IT.\n\nYou called, didn\u2019t answer. That should\u2019ve been where it ended until they called you back.", "YTA.\n\nIf it's THAT big of a deal, have a second or even third copy of the toy.\n\nEven better, use it as a moment to teach your child coping and reasoning skills.\n\nYou shouldn't have gone to their home without express permission, and you MOST DEFINITELY shouldn't have pushed to come inside when you were told she wasn't available. You owe them a nice gift card to dinner, a night for you to babysit their kid, and a very sincere apology. \n\nWorking from home does NOT MEAN she has flexibility to walk away from her work. I worked as a therapist for several years, primarily on telehealth during the pandemic. If someone were to interrupt a video session with a client who is in their most vulnerable state for a STUFFED ANIMAL, I can't even explain how upset I would be. That is not okay. This could cost someone their job", "Soft yta. Think about this, what if nobody had been home? Would you have still demanded entrance to the house if it were empty? This was a chance to teach your son patience and being mindful of other's schedules.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. I see both sides. I once drove 40 miles one way to get blankie because my son left it at his aunt\u2019s house. On the other hand I also work from home and nothing bothers me more then friends or family assuming I\u2019m available for literally anything other than my job. You understand how you inconvenienced her. If a sincere apology from you doesn\u2019t smooth everything over then I absolve you of any assholery.", "YTA. Not only did you show up to this woman\u2019s house after her not answering your calls.. you also wouldn\u2019t take NO for an answer when she tried to tell you she was working and was busy. How would you feel if this woman ( or anyone really )showed up to your job while you were in the middle of working for something like this.", "YTA. You invaded her space and disregarded common decency all for your own benefit. You called. They didn't answer. So, you chalk nap time up to a loss and wait for the call back. You didn't leave his insulin at the friend's house. It is a doll. \n\nYou could have used this as a teaching opportunity but instead you showed your son how to be entitled and blatantly disrespectful. You do not get to disregard manners for comfort and then blame the offended party for your outlandishly selfish and lazy parenting.\n\nI'm sorry for your family struggles. An infirmed, elderly parent in the hospital is very stressful. I hope your FIL recovers well. But your family troubles are no one else's problem but your's. They are definitely no excuse to trample boundaries and impose on others.", "Yes, YTA. Honestly, how self centered are you and your wife? She didn\u2019t answer, she didn\u2019t want to let you in. She said NO. And you continued pressuring her. Both you and your wife are awful.", "Tbh her note was more polite then you deserved. You both need to learn some patience. YTA.\n\nP.s why were you so sure it was at their place?", "YTA - please call this couple and offer them your sincerest apologies and assure them that that kind behavior will NEVER happen again. This wasn't a matter of life and death - this is about a child's stuffed toy. There was a lesson here - your child needs to keep track of his items or deal with consequences. Instead, you swooped in, invaded the privacy of someone who did you a good turn and then because angry/hurt because THEY were angry.\n\nYikes.", "YTA and on the road to raising an entitled child, good luck when he's a teen and you finally try to say no or not now. You had a teachable moment and were beyond rude and entitled yourself, so yeah you're  a huge AH", "YTA. Read her text over and over until it makes sense", "Of course YTA. Everyone with children understands your situation, apparently you as parents don\u2019t tho. If your child is that attached to an item, it\u2019s YOUR job to keep track of it. The other mom is right, if they don\u2019t reply. You shouldn\u2019t show up like that. It was rude.", "YTA. Your wife is a piece of work too. Your kid your problem ESPECIALLY because they already did you a favour.", "You literally barged into her home office (if she was working) and instead of taking no for an answer and teaching your child how to soothe himself and getting the stuffed animal later bullied your way into her place of work. Of course Yta and she\u2019s right the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you or your screaming child.", "You were pushy, but you were stressed and have acknowledged you were in the wrong. Soft YTA. \n\nYour situation can be easily resolved with a simple apology to the woman. She was simply setting a boundary in a polite way because she felt uncomfortable or unhappy with situation. Escalating it beyond a \"you're right, I'm really sorry. I let the stress get the best of me\" has probably caused long term damage to your relationship.", "NTA. Look, I get that people get busy, and yes they did you a favor, but this was toddler who is already in a stressful situation having a panic attack. The whole \"barged in\" and \"world revolving around you\" language is gross and incredibly passive-aggressive, and it's not as if you took up a bunch of their time, If the shoe were on the other foot, that's exactly what they would want you to do for them.", "YTA but a generous gift card to a nice restaurant as well as a genuine offer to reciprocate the sleepover, in other words a very nice date night, might help smooth things over. An apology is also in order.", "I'm sorry everyone but OP is NTA. 30 seconds to answer a text, 30 seconds to open a door.", "I\u2019m going soft YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re dealing with a very stressful situation but as you repeatedly pointed out these people did you a favor. 4 is young to be without a favorite stuffy but things happen and you can\u2019t always give them want they want. Suggesting a different stuffy until the other could be retrieved. If they didn\u2019t answer it\u2019s because they were busy. Instead of respecting them you kept pushing. Apologize maybe a nice gift card as a thank you for watching your kid and offer to watch theirs so they can have a date night.", "[deleted]", "ESH or NAH - so borderline.  I\u2019d do anything for my kid.  I don\u2019t think it is a huge deal to knock (she didn\u2019t actually have to answer the door\u2026).  She shouldn\u2019t have sent the text but was probably irritated at the interruption of her work - who knows what her day was like.  But you should apologize - won\u2019t hurt you to do it.  Bring them a bottle of wine or something at some point or something. For something this stupid and that something unlikely to be repeated, no reason not to just pretend to think you are the bigger a-hole.  After all, they did you the favor.  This is just so silly though.", "NTA she could have fetched the toy in 10 seconds", "NTA. As her being a fellow parent, she should understand children. This toy is obviously a security item for the child and she should understand why the child would be distraught without it. There\u2019s no need or reason for her to be so rude", "NTA - I think that this woman was being difficult for no real reason. Sounds like it took a whole two seconds to find the elephant. She made a big deal out of nothing.", "YTA, along with your wife. Sometimes kids don't get what they want. Reacting like that will not help your son learn to regulate emotions. Be the adult.", "YTA.  I work from home.  I have a lot of conference calls that I have to be tuned into in detail.  Oftentimes, I am the one leading the calls, and if I am not, it is probably my client talking and I am actively listening. When people knock on my door or buzz my apartment and I am on a call that I cannot step away from, I ignore it.  Especially if they have already called and texted and I know it\u2019s not an emergency. The only calls that I actually pay attention to are from family. \n\nIf I were on a call and these messages came in and despite my not responding to the messages, there was a knock at the door that required me to step away during an important meeting - I would be pissed off. Incredibly so. \n\nAnd then you fucking pushed in. In her house.  After she told you to come back later If nothing else, even if you weren\u2019t TA up until then, that\u2019s definitely the singular move that made you TA. As if her not responding to messages and the door were not enough, her verbal statement of the obvious also wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nIt\u2019s also just not a good situation to have your child so attached to the doll that its absence cannot be explained away for a few hours. You could have told him that his friend asked to borrow it, or at the very least was looking after it.  Honestly, you should have and could have gotten more creative to avoid disturbing someone during the workday. And knowing how attached he is to it, MAJOR failure for not paying attention to it when you picked him up. \n\nI get that things were stressed, but honestly, this is all on you, from start to finish.", "NTA. I can sort of understand her being annoyed that you pushed it when she asked to you come back. However, she did let you in, it's not like you forced your way into the house. Plus the text is a huge overreaction  and much more assholish. \n\nIt baffles me the number of people who are saying YTA because she was working and that you could have interrupted her doing something super important at work. First of all, did you even know for sure that she would be working from home? Secondly, she could just NOT answer the door - why the hell would she answer it if she was in the middle of something that important? I ignore people at my door all the time lol. \n\nEven as someone who absolutely HATES it when people show up at my house, I still say NTA, so thats saying a lot.", "What a tortuous argument. Begone.", "I woulda done the same thing if my son (now in college) had left Froggie somewhere. Full Shirley McClain. GIVE MY SON HIS FROG.", "NTA. If they are parents they would get that your sanity and the ability of your child to chill rests on that silly stuffed animal. I would have likely done the same thing. It would have been super easy for either of them to answer the phone, take the 2 minutes to look, and put Dumbo outside so that you didn\u2019t bother them.", "NAH just get a gift for them and say I\u2019m sorry. Move on from this. Probably don\u2019t ask them a favor again", "NTA- grow up cell phone people! Guess what life was like before being constantly able to screen. People showed up on your doorstep and you had to answer the phone to know who was calling and what they wanted. Do you want to know the truth? People were HAPPIER, I refuse to be friends with \u201cjust text\u201d people.", "I totally get the woman\u2019s annoyance, but getting the stuffed animal seems like a bit of a small ask.\n\nAt least when you consider how it took her so much more effort and mental energy to 1) ignore your texts 2) ignore your calls 3) ignore your knocking 4) ask you to not come in 5) let you in anyway and 6) to compose a nasty text then to just grab the dumb Dumbo and leave it by the door.", "NTA.  That woman didn't need to be so nasty.  I predict this is the end of any friendship between your child and her child.", "NTA.\n\nIf a parent sent me a text about how important sleepy dumbo was I would have had that little guy hanging on my doornob and apologizing!", "Info.  What is the relationship between you and these parents?  Are these like friends of yours, or is your only real relationship that they are your child's friend's parents?\n\nI guess I'll say NAH or ESH.  You had a kid going crazy and you were trying to deal with it I don't think you were \"wrong\" as you tried calling, and not answering doesn't automatically mean anything.  At the same time, I understand them being annoyed as well.  \n\nI think you may have overstepped by asking to come in, but I kind of get it.

Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.\n\nI remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.\n\nWhen we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.\n\nShe again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.\n\nWe get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.\n\nAbout an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:\n\n{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.\n\nI felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They said someone else was already in the room and they'd have to wait until housekeeping went in the next day. Guess what we did? Waited until the next day, told our daughter that we had to wait, comforted her in other ways to get her to sleep. The next day after they found him hubby went back to get him. And now all stuffies are accounted for before we even start the car. Our mistake shouldn't be someone else's problem.", "Exactly! I doubt that OP would have left if he wasn\u2019t able to find the toy after five minutes of looking. He probably would have insisted that he stay until they find it.

I can also see how OP may not have seen that way, they wouldn't have known if the text was ignored intentionally or not and it sounded like they thought they'd just try popping by instead. \n\nI think it was a parent with a distraught child trying to solve it.

And your wife is even worse than you since she is adamant you were justified in your assholery, so unless she changes her tune quickly they definitely won't want to associate with you two again.\n\nThe level of entitlement that you displayed... *Yikes*. And instead of balancing you out, your wife doubled down with her own unfounded entitlement! \n\nYour behaviour was inappropriate and unacceptable, and the fact that they had already done you a favour makes you and your wife into absolutely gaping assholes.", "If they are friends, I'd say its a bit different. \n\nIf my buddy was over with his kid, and his kid was having a fit about a toy, I wouldn't be upset about him coming over, even if I was working", "Ah I misunderstood", "They do this weird thing where a lot of the stuff they sell inside the theme parks can't be bought anywhere else.

They didn\u2019t answer their phone and they didn\u2019t answer their door at first which means they don\u2019t want to be disturbed. OP made it clear that he wasn\u2019t leaving. Whether they were ignoring the text intentionally or not is irrelevant. OP had no right to impose on them. If his child wouldn\u2019t take their nap without this toy, that\u2019s OP\u2019s problem, not theirs. OP was acting as if everything should stop because his child didn\u2019t have what he wanted which is the same thing as thinking the world revolves around you.

And use broad search terms.  Does it mean you might have to look at 500 listings?  Then you look at 500 listings.  \n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that especially when it's someone just listing an old stuffed animal, they will sometimes not use the \"correct\" keywords.  If the item's official name is \"Disney Parks Sleeping Dumbo\", odds are that someone out there has just listed it as \"Stuffed Dumbo\" or yes, even \"Sleepy Dumbo\", and if you just search on the official name, those mis-labelled ones won't come up.  (And those are often where you find bargains, too.)\n\nSomething else to keep in mind: some people use the term \"stuffed animal\", some use \"plush\", some use \"plushie\".  You might have to search on all of the terms to cover what someone might have listed it under.\n\nAnd -- Mercari and Poshmark are two other reseller websites similar to eBay.
