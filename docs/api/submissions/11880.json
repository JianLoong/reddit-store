When he has to go to work he has to get up at 4am, and I am getting up at 6:30 to take care of our 4 kids. He works 24h shifts so next morning is still me waking up at 6:30 but he had hard night and get back home around 8am.

I have kids your little ones\u2019. age. They like to get up early. I lay their uniforms and shoes out the night before so they can just put them on when they wake up and we make their lunches the night before as well and put it in the fridge so it just has to go in their bags in the morning. \nWe also have food like fruit and sandwiches prepped in the fridge all the time so that if they\u2019re hungry they can help themselves. \nThrough lots of work and with reward systems we\u2019ve managed to get them to get their uniforms on in the mornings if they are up before I am, and I find having their lunches etc all ready the night before makes it so much easier in the morning so I can focus on waking up and making sure their laces are tied, teeth are brushed and so on. \nMaybe you could ask your wife to do this prep work the night before school so that it\u2019s easier on you in the mornings if you\u2019re not already doing it?\nGood luck to you. She\u2019s stuck in a bad habit that clearly needs to change. \n\nIt just sucks that if you refuse to get up, your boys would end up missing school and that\u2019s not really good for anyone. :( but if the consequence of them missing the bus is that she\u2019d then have to rush and drive them? Do it. Let her do that and decide if that\u2019s easier than making sure they\u2019re up for the bus.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sounds all over the place. She may need to reflect on her routine and get back into a healthier space. Being a SAHM with health problems is probably really difficult and maybe she isn\u2019t in an organized place right now, especially with medication mishaps. She needs to get back on track because it isn\u2019t fair for you to be the only one caring for your kids in the mornings. \n\nMaybe the two of you need to sit down and come with a schedule or routine that works for both of you because you\u2019re both parents and your kids deserve a less hectic and more organized family structure.", "NTA Everyone should have days to sleep in undisturbed.

It seems you let your frustration go on too long without saying much how you\u2019ve felt and now when you approach her now, you might seem disproportionately angry. \n\nYou\u2019ve left out a lot of details. Is she a stay at home mom? Does she work? How late do you both work and go to sleep? Do the kids respond to your parenting differently?\n\nMedical issues aside, it\u2019s totally normal to expect your partner to contribute equally but you need to have a no BS conversation about your expectations.

I understand her struggles, even though I \"only\" struggle with depression (and anxiety) I have to take sleeping medications for it which makes me sluggish in the morning, but using the illness as an excuse to even try to get up is just not okay. Especially considering that she is a SAHM and the boys are in school, she could easily get them up and ready and then go back to bed once they're on the bus. She's not living up to her responsibility and I would sit down and have a serious conversation with her.", "INFO: You mention she knows you're frustrated, but have you told her flat out that division of responsibilities needs to improve? \n\nShe is TA regardless and it does not sound like this is sustainable at all, and you shouldn't have to continue being both the primary breadwinner and primary caretaker. But \"passive aggressively staying in bed\" while your kids run wild alone is not a solution. For your kids sakes, just because she is failing to parent does not mean you should start doing the same.", "NTA, but OP sleep apnea is nothing to compare to depression and thyroid issues - entirely different issue. I've dealth with the latter two and while the depression makes you feel mentally tired and sleep is the only time you might feel okay (literally wish you could sleep your problems away), the thyroid issues make you sluggish and physically exhausted if not medicated properly. I am not saying that any of these are excuses for you having to carry a heavier burden than her, being a parent and sharing responsibilities for these two humans you have made is for both of you. Try to communicate about this and maybe encourage her to check with medical professional if her state is okay for the medicine she is getting (stress affects thyroid issues a lot).", "Esh.

Depending on the severity you can stop breathing for a few seconds, snore, breathe loud, etc. Lack of sleep can cause daytime sleepiness, poor sleep, anxiety depression, headaches, often if untreated can cause lower life expectancy, and a variety of other things. My 14 yo son just had to have his nose basically reconstructed bc his 02 levels kept dropping to 82-85% in his sleep multiple times an hour. You literally have to have a machine (that is a couple thousands of dollars) you wear blowing oxygen into your nose and/or mouth (depending on the mask your prefer) to make sure you are getting proper air flow. So please don\u2019t be so dismissive when someone says they have sleep apnea.", "Oh so she's a SAHM but doesn't even want to do that job?\n\nGive me a break.\n\nYou shouldn't have to be the sole breadwinner \\*and\\* the domestic partner at the same time.", "Wow, if she\u2019s a SAHM that\u2019s unacceptable.

I am aware what sleep apnea is as my sibling has it too. In one case you need more sleep because you are not getting enough or it is poor quality. In the other case you feel as if you need more sleep because you can't handle being awake or you don't have energy to be awake. Both cases can use more sleep (or medical help), but only one of them in the current situation is the parent that gets up.", "She is responsible for dinner, but I take my \"lunch\" at work to help her get them down for bed.", "seriously?

If it happened occasionally, fine, but not all the time.\n\nI would tell your wife that if she cannot get up with the kids, you're going to hire a nanny and she can go back to work. Tell her you're serious. Outside of a major emergency, you're not going to be the one awake in the mornings getting the kids ready again. The next time she pulls this, you start interviewing nannies.

I do all the morning \u201cstuff\u201d while my husband sleeps in or relaxes before being busy from the moment he gets up until the moment he goes to bed. I consider us to be a team and part of my job as a SAHM is to make our lives run more smoothly, especially during the week when our division of labor is clear cut. I wonder if your wife maybe has lost her way a bit and isn\u2019t clear on her purpose as a SAHM now that her children are school aged? I guess has it always been this way or is this newish? If it\u2019s always been this way I don\u2019t know that being a SAHM is a good fit for her or your family, because if you continually have to pick up the slack for no substantive reason you will become more and more burnt out and resentful until the marriage fails. If this is not something you two can talk through together couples counseling is the exact right place to work through this. If it\u2019s relatively new she should probably be in counseling to help her find purpose or figure things out.", "Okay yeah that makes more sense. In my mind I was thinking like a factory job or something like that lol", "Username checks out", "NTA at all. What is your wife even doing all day?"]}
