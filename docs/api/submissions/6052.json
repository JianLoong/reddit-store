One of my best friends(28F) goes there semi regularly for yoga lessons. I put my heart and soul into the business and many of my clients complained that the heat in the room reduced when late people try to come into the class after it\u2019s began. It\u2019s also very annoying for the instructors to get them caught up. So I instituted a no late at all policy and will turn away people who show up late. Some people hate it and stopped showing but it hasn\u2019t hurt our profits and classes still fill up. \n\nThe friend and 2 others were late (2-3min late) and the employee at the front desk turned them away like she had been told to and my friend didn\u2019t argue but she did write a  scathing review saying the studio didn\u2019t care that people could die driving fast to not be late in bad conditions and that we could have blood on our hands from people trying to drive too fast and it was ridiculous to be turned away for only being late by 3 min. It was icy and snowy I\u2019ll agree but we also live in Canada. It\u2019s cold and icy 4 months of the year, people should factor it into the travel time it takes.\n\nI called her and asked her to remove in bad review. She told me she expects the missed class to be reimbursed or rescheduled and the no late policy to be waved in the winter and she will take it down. I told her I can absolutely reschedule her class but I cannot make a policy change just because she wants me to do it. I argued work will dock pay if people are late and she argued those jobs are losing people and most good jobs are understanding to bad weather. I said everything has a start time like kids soccer practice, doc appointments etc and me instituting a no late policy isn\u2019t a big deal. She said \u201chot yoga isn\u2019t a big enough deal to make people stressed out about being late that they would drive fast in winter\u201d. I told her it\u2019s not important to her but it\u2019s my business and I\u2019m running it the way I want to. She said sure and she won\u2019t be going back to the studio but her review is staying up. \n\nShe is one of my closest friends but I\u2019m questioning if we should stay friends because she is intentionally damaging my business.

All you need to do is reply to her review stating the facts that complaints were being made about people turning up late and it was making it hard for instructors. Your friend is super lucky that it was yoga and not a stand-up comedian\u2019s show. If you turn up late to one of their shows you get the attention of the whole room placed onto you", "NTA. Her review saying the studio could have blood on their hands by people speeding to class because they are late is extremely dramatic. If i were to read that comment on reviews I would think she was a whack-a-do. I wouldn't want to be friends with her anymore.", "NTA. Your policy is totally reasonable, because late-comers are disruptive and lower the temperature as you said. Also her argument is absurd. Just calculate enough buffer. 99% of the participants are able to arrive on time, so the problem is not the policy, but her organization.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wanted to be on time, she would\u2019ve been on time. \n\nShe\u2019s not much of a friend if she expects preferential treatment for something that almost everyone else was able to do in a timely manner. She\u2019s putting her *desire* to flout the rules above your *need* to earn a living to survive.\n\nETA: She only left the scathing review because she didn\u2019t get her way. Expecting to be reimbursed in exchange for removing it shows how much she values you as a friend and your business.", "NTA\n\nIf she\u2019s bothered by the late policy, then she and the other tail-end-Charlie arrivers should adjust their departure time by 10 minutes so they arrive to class on time.\n\nShe\u2019s abusing your friendship; Her using her review to strong-arm you into making exceptions and concessions for her at the expense of the other (respectful, paying) members  is selfish and entitled. Those other members can get themselves to class on time. A membership is a contract that customers receive a quality product, which in this case includes consistent temperatures and minimal interruptions and distractions. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is not compatible with your business and policies. When members do not comply with the policies in place, they are typically asked to cancel their membership and take their business elsewhere. You cannot allow your \u201cfriend\u201d to hinder your business- she is one (entitled, bratty) member out of many. I think you can safely cut her membership and friendship loose.", "NTA. If i read that review, I would laugh and probably favor your studio for your tough stance on late arrivals.", "NTA - why does your closest friend treat you so poorly?", "NTA, because her bad review is based on a rule that SHE broke. And was more than aware of beforehand.  \nBut here's the Devil's Gambit:  be prepared to lose a friend over it. Essentially, she tried to take advantage of you because she thought -- that as your friend -- she was \"special\".  \nWhich...in not respecting you and trying to take advantage of you...is she really a friend?  \nJust remember -- if you make this concession to her now, it will NOT be the last one. So is she THAT good of a friend?\n\nThe choice is yours.", "What kind of friend does something to hurt another friends business over a relatively small amount and issue? If there are no other parts of the story and no other history of arguments between you two, your friend is the AH. My internal clock generally runs late, and it's only proper that I take ownership of that and not blame others. If things happened that day and it was out of her control, then offering to reschedule is sufficient, and maybe talk later about giving 5 minutes in the winter before starting class. \n\nEither way, friends are supposed to help friends.", "NTA. But respond on your reviewing website and explain the reasons behind your policy, so when ppl see the review, they can see your response to it. Don't be mean or nasty. Just calm and reasonable.", "NTA. Look at the huge flaw in her reasoning.\nShe says yoga \"isn't a big enough deal to stress people out over being late in winter\", yet she considers it important enough to risk your life to be there on time. If someone drives unsafely in icey conditions and dies because they were late to a yoga class, that's on them.\n\n\nShe sounds like a massively entitled person.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" does have a right to post an honest review (and I think you can admit that she really was unhappy) about the business, but she's a bad friend if she is valuing her annoyance over the policy over your friendship. Accepting bad reviews is part of being in business, but I think you have a right to expect that at least your friends will have your back.", "NTA - I\u2019ve been to many yoga studios (no hot yoga though) and all of them had a zero tolerance for being late to a class. It disturbs the others in the class. I also live in Canada, you just have to give yourself extra time in the winter and adjust your schedule.", "I teach Pilates and we have a five minute grace period policy. We don\u2019t have the same issues (heat escaping when the door is opened) but the truth is that latecomers interrupt the class for the other 9 people who managed to show up on time. It interrupts the flow, which isn\u2019t fair to the instructor. And it generally means that the latecomer has to interrupt the class again when they realize that they don\u2019t have a piece of equipment near they\u2019re station that everyone else got when I told them what they would be using in the first minute or two of class.\n\nFurther, the same people are always late. It never fails. If I let someone slide on the rule and come in once, they view it as a free pass to come in later and later. I had  woman who was consistently late show up 25 minutes into a 50 minute class and expect to jump in. \n\nAs far as the weather goes, how bad is the weather if everyone else manages to get there on time? Most people know they will need more time when roads are bad.", "NTA. Letting people in late to fitness classes, but especially something like yoga, is extremely distracting, and disrespectful to the students who showed up on time, and the instructor. I wish all studios had, and enforced this policy.", "NTA. I thought all yoga classes had this policy. It\u2019s pretty much a known fact you shouldn\u2019t interrupt a yoga class once it\u2019s started. Because she\u2019s your friend, it\u2019s ok to ask her to take the review down but if she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not a big deal. Her review just makes her look clueless. Personally, though, I couldn\u2019t be friends with her anymore.", " NTA I would reply to the review stating that this rule is to provide an enjoyable atmosphere for all attendees, if weather is a concern then factor that in when leaving the house, also to imagine that the class will start 10 minutes before that way they can be there on time then.", "Was the change communicated clearly and well in-advance?", "NTA. You asked a \u201cfriend\u201d to reconsider her review after you explained the reason for the policy change. She tried to extort you with said review. \n\nHonestly, a friend would come to you before ripping into your business online. Either she doesn\u2019t feel that close to you or she\u2019s a really bad friend. Either way you should reconsider your relationship", "2-3 minutes late. Then set up. Take shoes and layers off. Now it\u2019s even later\u2026\n\nI\u2019d politely respond to the review.", "NTA The late policy was started because it was affecting the class members and dropping the temperature. You started this to improve class time. People should manage their time to be there on time if they want to attend the class. Your friend needs time management.", "Literally every yoga studio I\u2019ve ever been to has a door locked policy \ud83d\ude05", "NTA\n\nWhen conditions are bad (icy/raining) you leave earlier, to account for road conditions and traffic. Her being late is not your fault, it's her for not leaving for the studio early enough.\n\n>saying the studio didn\u2019t care that people could die driving fast to not be late in bad conditions\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about her review. People who check reviews usually read the negative ones and if the no late entrance policy bothers someone, they are free to go elsewhere, as they will be just as entitled as your \"friend\".", "NTA.  I feel like only people who are always late complain about being late \ud83d\ude02.  Also, a best friend would never leave a catty, negative review on their best friends wall.  Or at least none of mine would.. they\u2019d all give awesome ones (even if my business sucked haha).", "NTA. This is a red flag and you need new friends", "NTA. Your friend is dramatic.", "NTA.  Your friend is a huge asshole.", "NTA.  She's not a good friend.", "NTA. My local yoga studio has the same rule, they lock the door and don\u2019t open it once class begins because it is disruptive to the class. It is clearly stated that this is the rule in the paperwork we sign to become members", "NTA. Every yoga studio I\u2019ve ever gone to has had a zero tolerance policy for tardiness for that exact reason. It breaks the seal on the room, disrupts the heat and breaks the peaceful concentration people go there to achieve. She\u2019s a dick for leaving the review. She should have understood.", "NTA, and I'd like to point out that \"one of your closest friends\" basically accused you of attempting to get people killed.  Generally speaking those who accuse me of murder/attempted manslaughter/gross negligence for having reasonable boundaries and expectations are not the kind of people I'd even call friends.", "NTA and she definitely is NOT your friend, fyi.", "NTA.  She needs to learn how to better manage her time.  If I were you, I would try to stop thinking of her as \"one of my closest friends\" and think of her as \"a friend\"  and as \"someone I know.\"", "NTA. Other yoga goers may appreciate the policy. You know when it's snowy to leave earlier. \n\nSo, people might go on and read and go, \"Huh, a business that actually enforces its own policy! I love it!\" \n\nBecause there are many more that have policies but they are worthless policies if you don't back it up.", "NTA. She sounds terrible.", "NTA your friend makes me sad - who acts like that ? i wouldn't leave a bad review on the small business of someone i didn't get along with very well over this  \nhope your studio has a great year !", "Its just one comment. Why don\u2019t you create a standard reply regarding policy in the comments section of your business and explain that you understand about the strict rules on time and why its implemented. Ignore your friend she is just tol entitled", "NTA, what kind of friend is this?  Geez, she doesn't respect you or your business.", "NTA - They'd be the same to complain about the heat being reduced when late arrivals are admitted.\n\nThere are no pleasing some people and this person is merely annoyed because they can't plan accordingly to get there in time.\n\nIf it takes longer to get there because of the weather don't drive faster, leave earlier.", "NTA. You had clear rules regarding the late policy and it would be unfair to make an exception for your friend. Regarding the review, you did the right thing by asking her to take it down. Her actions caused her to be late and you shouldn\u2019t be penalized for upholding the late policy. Absolutely NTA", "Ban her from classes. That should also be a policy. If a member cannot be in class on time, and leaves a negative review, they will no longer be welcome.", "NTA for asking her to remove the review. She obviously has no experience as a business owner and I can completely understand why you had to make these rules. Have you explained to her that the temp change with late-comers has been something you've had complaints about? Also, where was the review? Some websites allow you to respond to the review and you could do that to explain why the rule is in place and that you tried to accomodate her.", "NTA, as long as they were made aware beforehand. That person is not a friend, either way.", "NTA.  This is not the behavior of a friend.  This person is acting like an entitled ass.  They knew that they are wrong, but expected to be the exception.  When not given the pass they thought they should get, they did something that could affect your business, which is your livelihood.  They care nothing for anybody but themselves, and you'd be better off without them as friends and as clients.", "NTA but I'd suggest maybe allowing a 5 minute grace time BEFORE starting the class", "NTA. All the Hot Yoga studios I know have this policy, no late entry.  It is also not your responsibility that she was late, she should leave with enough time to get there based on conditions.  She's not a real friend if she expects you to damage your business for her, all she has to do is manage her time better.", "NTA", "Reply to her bad review and let it be known that being she is one of your closest friends it's alarming you would post such a hateful review instead of calling me to discuss your issue.", "NTA. When you are attending a class - especially one with other people - it's your responsibility to get there with time to spare, so you can change, put your hair up/out of the way where necessary, get any gear ready, and get in the right headspace to learn. Bad weather or not, you should never be leaving for the class late enough that you're speeding to get there on time, or disrupting the class by entering late.", "NTA. Obviously this person shouldn\u2019t be your friend anymore.  New year, new you!", "NTA.  What a stupid, over dramatic review.  Leave earlier if the roads are dangerous and you need to be somewhere by a certain time", "Nta.... And your friends review is not really about the business, it's about one policy that she can't follow. A lot of review sites allow the owners to respond and just respond if the weather's bad leave 15 minutes earlier if you're running late and it's bad weather why are you going out in the first place. And then say reviewing the policies not reviewing my business or the results of my class and that's how you handle that", "NTA. If you can respond to her respond to her review, then do so with something along the lines of, we had to institute a no late entry policy die to multiple complaints from customers and staff, while we're sorry this has lead to some dissatisfaction we are now pleased to find our classes run so much better without disruption from late comers", "NTA. I used to regularly do hot yoga and the studio I went to had the same rule", "NTA - late polices are there are for a reason. If I arrived early to my class and get disturbed by late comers as a class was starting I would be a bit annoyed too. Yoga is all about being in the moment with no distractions from the outside with breath work and mediating. It\u2019s disrespectful to the others who made a point to be on time. She sounds privileged and thinks she should have special treatment just because she knows you.", "NTA \n\nOn most reviews your business can publicly respond. \n\nI would say something like \u201cOur policy is in place to ensure the sanctity and quality of the class for our clients. By having people arrive late, it disrupts the instruction and cools the room which takes away from the enjoyment of other patrons. The no late policy is clearly posted for all clients to review. May we suggest that in order to be on time, you aim to arrive with a 15-minute buffer time? This ensures you don\u2019t miss the class and the enjoyment of others isn\u2019t disturbed. Hope we see you back (and on time) \ud83d\ude0a\u201d\n\nWhen you respond, it at least shows people who are reading reviews what happened. Always be excessively polite on the public reviews as this is marketing for you.", "NTA as long as you make it clear on your website and on booking that there is no late entry.", "NTA - it's not just your job, it's your personal business. You put your heart and soul into that. If she had a problem, she should have gone to you directly, not publicly slammed your livelihood and passion and all your hard work. If she can't see that, then I'm not sure the friendship will survive", "Lmfao NTA.  Just reply that you\u2019re respecting the experience of the people who were able to plan ahead to account for the conditions.  \n\nDon\u2019t drive worse because you\u2019re late.  Leave earlier.", "YTA. But only for one reason:\n\nAs a business owner, it's not your place to have negative reviews removed so long as they are factual. If your friend wasn't telling any lies in her review, then it's an asshole move to contact them and ask them to remove it.\n\nThe purpose of reviews is to give potential customers information about whether to use your business, and that includes negative reviews. Sometimes people will do business with someone specifically *because* of negative reviews.\n\nFor example: Your business. For hot yoga, there are very good reasons to have a no-late policy. So if I was a prospective client and saw that you not only have that policy, but can see evidence that you actually enforce it - that's a positive in my book.\n\nThe quality of your work will speak for itself. The proper thing to do with a negative review is to acknowledge it, apologize for it, restitute the customer when possible and appropriate, and explain your side of the story. If you have a good reason for your policy, don't be afraid of it; embrace it and don't apologize for the policy, only the circumstances.", "ESH. It's a business. Treat it as a business. You should have let the review stand without complaint. I would have read that complaint and not seen it as a bad review on the business but a bad reviewer blaming business for her own bad management.", "I'm of a mixed mind. Ultimately, I think YTA for asking her to take it down. She is/was a paying customer and has a right to write a review - just like anyone else. That being said, it doesn't sound like she's a very good friend.\n\nAlso - I love hot yoga (specifically Bikram) and a no-tolerance late policy has been consistent across every studio I've attended. I doubt it will actually hurt your business and it's not at all out of the ordinary.", "NTA. But she sure is.", "NTA, but you need to drop this entitled A H of a \u201cfriend\u201d. She is not a friend. Friends don\u2019t act this way.", "nta - your friend sure is i mean that review is way overboard and i live in canada too and when its winter and stuff ppl are late but if u r late your late and policy is policy.  its ridiculus your friend goes on about dying if u speed to show up on time for class.  i know tons of yoga places and other businesses that have closed door late policy and dont change it for anyone.  i bet your in vancouver like i am where ppl dont get their way and get revenge by posting on yelp.  lose the friend i bet there were other red flags in past", "NTA - She can leave earlier and arrive on time, so her faux guilt trip about speeding and dying is as ridiculous as she is.\n\nSee if you can counter/respond to the review (Yelp and sometimes Google I have seen business owners do that). Make it clear there are signs posted stating NO LATECOMERS and that the reason is that it disrupts the room temperature after sessions have begun, which is upsetting for those wanting the 'hot' part of 'hot yoga'.\n\nI mean, there's a reason it's not called 'temperately warm yoga'. Does she also stand there with the oven door open and wonder why her food is taking longer to cook? Seriously though lol", "Lol that lady is not a friend. Fuck her", "NTA but I\u2019d do 5 minutes! Maybe charge a fee if they are late too\u2026 orange theory does and it makes me never late lol", "NTA and you should also (if you don\u2019t already) suggest members show up 15 minutes earlier to make sure they\u2019re ready for class at the start time or something like that.", "NTA. And I say that as a person with timekeeping difficulties.\n\nAlso, I note she said \u201cpeople could die\u201d, but subsequently stated that hot yoga isn\u2019t a big enough deal to stress people out about being late? She\u2019s just being spiteful.", "NTA- your friend sucks. But, if her review drives away people who feel entitled to roll in late, maybe that\u2019s a good thing", "NTA. \n\nI had to laugh at her claim that hot yoga isn\u2019t a big enough deal to make people stressed about missing their class. She\u2019s making into the big deal. Why not leave ahead of time to factor in road conditions instead of act like a fool driver?", "Yea. She's not your friend.  Tell her to remove her review then you'll reimburse her. Put it in writing then be done with her.", "ESH...\n\nYour friend is being completely unreasonable and entitled, regarding telling you to change your policy or reimburse her... rescheduling seems reasonable to me, like you offered... not offering rescheduling might be too strict a policy, if you had that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut anyone can write bad reviews, and i guess she's entitled to write hers... asking her to remove it is ok, but **expecting** her to, makes YTA... but up to you whether you want to end the friendship over this, I don't think you'd be the AH either way... it was very AH of her to blast your business online just because she can't arrive on time...\n\nIs it a review site where you can write a responding comment? If you can, just write a good explanation of the reason for the policy... anyone reading the review will very likely side with you on this issue...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done a little hot yoga years ago, and the place also had a no late policy, for the same reason, and I'm all for it... though their policy was more like: the 8pm class actually started at 8:05, and no one could enter after 8:05... psychologically, i think that helps those of us who are often arriving right at start time or running 1 or 2 min late... not saying you should change your policy, just an idea if you wanted... :)", "ESH - 2-3 min late is pretty ridiculous to turn people away for\u2026 I can see 10 min in but 2 is literally just the difference the clock in my car eventually settles on when I reset it. Her response as your friend is over the top though. I would expect a friend to talk to me directly first not put my business on blast online immediately. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she sees you as as good of a friend as you see her.", "YTA. She's a customer and has every right to give a review of a business. Unless she wrote something that wasn't correct. She didn't do that. Accept that she has that right and decide if this is a friendship worth keeping.", "NTA. With friends like that who needs enemies. She sounds very entitled and a bit unhinged about the driving fast because of your business policies scenarios. New friends\u2026?", "NTA but this person is **not your friend** \u2014 just saying.", "How much of a friend s she got f she s posting negative reviews about your business and demanding you change your policy?\nNTA", "ESH. She's overreacting to being told she can't come in, but you have no business telling her to remove her accurate review. Did she lie?", "[deleted]", "Yta\n\nSorry but I think you are only using \u201cshes a friend\u201d as an excuse\u2026 it is a legitimate review\u2026 so what if a random person left it? Would you be begging the random to remove their review? No because it is legitimate review. She isnt intentionally ruining your business, she left her opinion for others just like you would do for a restaurant.\n\nNow I think you should review your late policy\u2026 like 2-3 mins seems rather harsh\u2026 maybe give a leeway of 5 mins ?", "YTA. In most reviews the business owner can reply back to the reviews. You can contest the review or justify it but you can't ask them to take it down.", "[deleted]", "I worked by appointment and my late policy was never ever as unyielding as 2-3 minutes. \n\nYou\u2019ve got to find some balance here. \n\nYTA.", ">She told me she expects the missed class to be reimbursed or rescheduled ...I told her I can absolutely reschedule her class but I cannot make a policy change just because she wants me to do it.\n\nINFO Do you not give refunds to the people who are late? I think that's the only thing you could do better, because if someone should be able to decide it's not worth it if they're 2 minutes late. \n\nOtherwise, if the review is honest, there's no point in trying to take it down? I don't think most people are going to pay much mind to it, and if anything it will discourage people who don't care about being on time, which you'd want anyways. \n\nIf you think the review makes you look bad, then you should change the policy. Otherwise it is just telling people that the policy is very strict. It's might be mean for your friend to leave a scathing review, but if you're not giving her special treatment for being your friend, I don't see why she should do the same? I think you could stand to just agree to disagree, but if this is enough to ruin your friendship it is up to you. I would try to take the emotions out of it though, it's just business.", "NAH - you\u2019re not TA for asking for the review to be removed but you can\u2019t force her to remove it. You will get bad reviews. That\u2019s just a fact of business and I personally like to know how flexible businesses are with their policies so that I can know what to expect. I\u2019d skip the theatrics in her review but note that she was 2-3 minutes late and not allowed in class.", "Yes, you are TA for expecting her to take it down.  It's her opinion, and it's an opinion that others may find relevant.  The whole point of review sites is to have customer's opinions that are unfiltered to read.\n\nIt's  technically an ESH for the review being scathing, rather than just \"this is a bad policy and the company should change it, buyer beware\", however.\n\nThat said, she has a point.  Weather conditions can make what ought to be a reasonably planned trip take just a few minutes longer. Especially if you have a precious parking situation.  If your teachers can't adapt for people entering the room 2-3 minutes late, well... they need to improve their teaching.  If your clients can't handle people coming in 2-3 minutes late, well... they need to improve their practice, and I mean all the rest of the yoga practice that isn't asana.  But complete inflexibility in any conditions can be a remarkable pain, and will, in the long run, have an impact on your business.\n\nThat said, it's your decision to make.  Articulate it clearly and prolifically, and you're covered.  I'd probably skip your studio, because life happens, but other clients will be happier.\n\n(FWIW, if you offer pre-/post-natal, unheated classes, however, you will be completely TA if you do not waive the policy for any class where babies are allowed to attend with the post-partum parent.)", "ESH- she\u2019s wrong for the bad review, you\u2019re wrong for not allowing a small cushion especially in bad weather.   You need to give them at least 5 minutes and you owe your friend and the other person a refund and an apology.", "YTA. She didn't say anything untrue.  Her point about weather is reasonable (though you haven't said if it was a factor)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I put my heart and soul into the business and many of my clients complained that the heat in the room reduced when late people try to come into the class after it\u2019s began. It\u2019s also very annoying for the instructors to get them caught up. So I instituted a no late at all policy and will turn away people who show up late. Some people hate it and stopped showing but it hasn\u2019t hurt our profits and classes still fill up. \n\nThe friend and 2 others were late (2-3min late) and the employee at the front desk turned them away like she had been told to and my friend didn\u2019t argue but she did write a  scathing review saying the studio didn\u2019t care that people could die driving fast to not be late in bad conditions and that we could have blood on our hands from refuses to late in people who were late by 3 min. It was icy and snowy I\u2019ll agree but we also live in Canada. It\u2019s cold and icy 4 months of the year, people should factor it into the travel time it takes.\n\nI called her and asked her to remove in bad review. She told me she expects the missed classes to be reimbursed or rescheduled and the no late policy to be waved in the winter and she will take it down. I told her I can absolutely reschedule her class but I cannot make a policy change just because she wants me to do it. I argued work will dock pay if people are late and she argued those jobs are losing people and most good jobs are understanding to bad weather. I said everything has a start time like kids soccer practice, doc appointments etc and me instituting a no late policy isn\u2019t a big deal. She said \u201chot yoga isn\u2019t a big enough deal to make people stressed out about being late that they would drive fast in winter\u201d. I told her it\u2019s not important to her but it\u2019s my business and I\u2019m running it the way I want to. She said sure and she won\u2019t be going back to the studio but her review is staying up. \n\nShe is one of my closest friends but I\u2019m questioning if we should stay friends because she is intentionally damaging my business. But AITA for asking her to review her bad review about my business?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she is truly your friend, I feel like a phone call to you to discuss the issue would have been more appropriate. Also, she is super dramatic in her review. If the roads are too bad to drive safely\u2026stay home.

You can\u2019t please everyone all of the time, so implement the policies you feel best for your business.", "NTA. It\u2019s *winter.* It happens every year, it\u2019s not a surprise.

For anyone saying 2-3 minutes is not a big deal, typically it is for a class workout. They are missing out on the warm-up part, which is crucial for preventing injuries.\n\nFurthermore, someone who won\u2019t take responsibility for their own shitty planning is also probably someone that will not be respectful when they do join the class. It is disruptive and annoying to the class members who aren\u2019t too stupid to realize that you should probably allow a little more time for travel when the weather is bad.\n\nI hate people like this because the behavior is selfish and they refuse to see themselves as the problem. She is inconsiderate and rude, and I\u2019m willing to bet that if you thought about it, there are probably tons of other instances throughout your friendship where she behaved that way. It\u2019s too high maintenance of a relationship to have with someone like that because they can\u2019t seem to take anyone else into account except themselves.", "She's definitely not being a good friend.

The only people who will take her review to heart are people who would agree with her. Do you want those customers? No.\n\nIn fact, the people who hate latecomers and the ensuing temperature issues they cause will love this \"bad\" review because it confirms you take the issue seriously. An issue that they also take seriously.", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to punish you and gaslight you into feeling bad for not giving her preferential treatment. \n\nShe may be pissed she missed the class and is justified feeling that way, but that type of review is uncalled for - especially to a friend\u2019s business. \n\nBan her from the business and block her.", "NTA \n\nLol fuck her. She's a shit friend and is basically trying to extort you. \n\nAnd her bs of trying to say y'all want people to speed to get there on time is just fucking stupid and insane.\n\nLearn some time management skills and grow the fuck up.\n\nThere's a theater I go to that has a similar policy where if you come late you can't come in and honestly it's great for similar reason you have your policy. It's better for the people you do arrive on time and it's incentive (spelling?) to show up on time and not be a disruptive dick.\n\nAnd if I saw that review on a business I would laugh. Hell the theater posts them on the screen before the movies start and people laugh at them.", "Info: How bad was the weather?", "NTA and she is extremely entitled.

What kind of friend would leave that in a review instead of just telling you!?\n\nSince she did though and won't remove it, then you just reply about her being late and the policy in your most personal tone. Most people will appreciate that and just think she's a bad customer.", "You should reconsider your friendship.\n\nNTA", "NTA you wouldn't be wrong at all either way. Give in to her demands and you can possibly save a friendship with a questionable person. And also save a bad review from affecting your business. Consider it in the marketing budget.

Good for you, and NTA.", "NTA\n\nYoga studio I went to had this policy, and I hated it when they lenient about enforcing it in the non heat classes.

As a small business owner myself, I would cut ties with a friend who pulled something like this. Oftentimes our policies are put into place for a reason, not just because we feel like it. \n\nThroughout your post, it seems she keeps pushing the \u201cpeople could die from trying to drive fast\u201d thing, but I feel like it\u2019s pretty standard practice for people to leave earlier with poor road conditions, right?

I work in a salon and we give a 15 Minute grace. I think this is extreme.", "... I'm kinda questioning the logic here. Why such a focus on driving fast? Folks don't need to drive fast to make it to class on time; they just need to adjust their schedule to leave a 10-15 minute buffer for travel. If the roads are especially difficult, then give yourself a 20-30 minute buffer. No need to speed needed, just better time management.\n\nNTA. Your friend sounds very entitled and trying to put the onus on you for her poor time management skills.

Feel free to ignore it. \nMaybe you (or the employee at the reception) could open the door once 10 or 15 min into the class so all the latecomers can enter at once.

Unless she lied in her review, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to ask her to take it down. I\u2019ll probably get downvoted for saying this, but I honestly think it\u2019s a little unprofessional to ask someone to remove an honest review of their experience/opinion of your business because of your personal relationship. \n\nGranted, I\u2019m not sure I would negatively review a friend\u2019s business over just explaining to them personally what I didn\u2019t like about the new policy.", "NTA\u2026but honestly, if your friend wrote it as you stated, I would not worry about her review at all.

She made an announcement the next class, but those same women kept on coming and kept on wearing perfume. After a month I just stopped going.  The yogi called and asked me why I stopped and I was honest with her.  She apologized and that was it. I missed my studio because the yogi wouldn\u2019t enforce the no fragrance rule.

Also in busy classes people may need to move their mats to make space for the new comers which is very annoying if the class has Alreasy started.

People were commenting that they (the pizza shop employees) should be ashamed, that she should sue the pizza place, etc., and all I could think was \"WHO IN THE WORLD would expect to get a free pizza after eating 87.5% of the other one????\" If I got the wrong toppings but the pizza was edible, I wouldn't even bother calling the pizza shop about it. I'd only ask for a replacement if they put on a topping I loathe, like mushrooms, and I wouldn't eat 7 slices of the mushroom pizza first.", "Yeah, if I read a review that they wouldn't let a customer in **after they arrived late** and wouldn't refund the money I'd be like, sweet, we're not going to be waiting on ppl coming when it suits them, and if they don't get their money back, chances are the tardies will weed themselves out.\n\nNta.
