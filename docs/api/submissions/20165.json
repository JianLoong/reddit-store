Eric made an excuse that \u201cThat\u2019s just my sense of humor\u201d and that anyone is being sensitive if they really take what he says to heart or don\u2019t also find it funny. My parents have honestly enabled this.

But you told him exactly what he needed to hear, regardless if he liked it or not. Hopefully he changes", "NTA. Eric spent high school being an AH and enabled by his parents. You've tried your best to explain to him why that's no longer working, but he's not receptive to change. \n\nYou really tried to help him, and if he had just listened, things could have improved. Unfortunately, he still thinks he can do no wrong and your parents are still in the \"that's just Eric\" phase.", "NTA- Your parent\u2019s response was enough to know why he is the way he is. He doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for his actions and now he must suffer the consequences, I cant wait till he joins the workforce.", "NTA.  And Eric minimizing your friendships because you are female is pretty disgusting.  He sounds like an unpleasant person altogether.  You are the only person looking out for him by being honest.  Everyone else is setting him up for failure", "NTA oh no that can't be the consequences of his actions didn't his parents tell those to go away?", "NTA if there\u2019s a group and he is bullying, one person in the group, everyone will turn away from him because of his behavior. It looks like Eric is having social issues because of his           inability to navigate social situations. He\u2019s going to have to learn these lessons by himself because your parents aren\u2019t there to enable the behavior.", "NTA but there isn't much you can do other than let life teach him a hard lesson.\n\nYour brother reminds me of a former friend if mine. This guy had the time of his life in high school and he treated others the same way your brother does.\n\nHe went off to law school and he hooked a nice girl into believing that he was going to be a hotshot lawyer.  He dropped out because he realized that he wasn't as smart as he thought he was and that other students ran laps around him.\n\nHis wife left him out of the blue and he hasn't had a real relationship since(15 years at this point) and he's had nothing but assistant manager retail gigs. All the people that he would dunk on to boost his ego are now more successful than he is\n\nDude is in his 40s and he still lives with his parents the last time I checked and all he does all day is play videogames", "NTA! Eric needs a reality check!", "NTA. Your brother is a dick and people don't like to be around that. He can change or be alone, his choice.", ">I brought it up to them and they would just say things like \u201cOh, well that\u2019s Eric for you.\u201d\n\n. . . and this is just Eric reaping what he sowed. Your assessment was correct - be a shitty person and people will avoid you.\n\nYour parents avoided helping Eric learn this lesson. He's now learning it through personal experience. His response to your insight tells you he hasn't internalized the lesson just yet, but he'll get there someday. Or he won't and he'll continue to be lonely.\n\nNTA", "NTA- he totally needed to be told what he was doing was wrong. Your parents are doing him a big disservice by not giving him a heads up on what behavior is accepted at this age.", "NTA. Jokes and teasing are only funny if everyone is in on it. My friends and I say some really out of pocket crap to each but we're all in agreement on the level of humor. If someone says \"hey man, that was actually kinda mean\", there's a sincere apology and we move on. Your brother is facing the consequences of his actions.", "NTA, it's time for you brother to grow up and accept that his attitude is going to push people away.", "NTA.  Time for your brother to think about his behavior.  This should have been your parents' job through the years, but apparently they are protective of how he has behaved and are expecting you to be the same.  Eric's comments to you weren't exactly kind or considerate so sounds like you were having a pretty raw discussion and that you had some points he needs to think about.  He might not have liked what you told him but sounds like he needed to hear them and that now he needs to give them some serious consideration. This can be done without being unsupportive, just honest.  I assume you are trying to help your brother with his peer issues, not just tear him down.", "NTA.  You kept it real with Eric.", "NTA. It's come time for Eric to learn that being a shitty person doesn't make you popular or cool. The real world is much different than high school. Hopefully, he'll realize his behavior is wrong and learn to treat others the way he wishes to be treated. Shame on your parents for enabling this behavior, but good on you for speaking the truth.", "NTA. He needed to hear that. And wow, complains about people being over sensitive then went crying to the parents. \n\nYour brother and your parents need a wake up call. Did you tell them what he said to you?", "NTA sounds like he can't find anyone to be his new ego boosting, punching bag- i mean \"friend\" in a new place, so he called you up to do it instead. Sorry your brothers a weiner, there's still time for him to grow out of it though hopefully.", "NTA. Gotta call out people who need calling out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
