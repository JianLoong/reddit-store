After you graduate, you no longer have to spend eight hours a day around the same group of people, and you have a lot more freedom with who you want to associate with.\n\nAnother reason I realize that being mean still allows you to maintain a social life in high school is because most teenagers are immature. Watching someone get picked on is okay, or even funny, so long as someone else is the butt of the joke. But the majority of people mature after high school graduation, especially if they go to college.\n\nFor adults, the same kind of bullying behavior that was okay or funny as a teenager is now off-putting. The person who does it is no longer cool or edgy. My brother doesn't seem to understand that and has a lot of growing up to do.", "I'd tell your parents if they want to make excuse for him he's going to spend his life isolated and they'll be his only friends. \n\nPeople don't like nasty people. The only people who are naturally okay with it are real pieces of work themselves. This is not the thing to be making excuses for", "Part of growing up is learning that your parents aren\u2019t always right, and just because they think something is okay doesn\u2019t mean it is. \n\nEither he\u2019ll learn and grow, or he\u2019ll keep running to your parents and stagnate. Ultimately, no one can make that choice for him.", "Yeah I had a friend who is just like OPs brother. She's in her mid 40s now and most people despise her. She has very few friends left. She doesn't care, and brags about how she's a misanthrope who only likes her husband and no one else. People don't always fix themselves.

He humiliates people and then says its not serious or they are to sensitive.  That is a bully making excuses.  You told him a few years ago and he didn't think you were right.\n\nHe objectifies you be thinking that an attractive woman would be popular because they are an attractive woman, not due to. their personality.\n\nNTA, and your parents aren't helping.", "NTA. Don't back down, OP. Your parents didn't do their job with him, but it might not be too late", "I\u2019m sorry but he got exactly what he deserved. He doesn\u2019t get to treat people like shit and then claim they are too sensitive. Your brother is plain and simple the asshole and your parents are enabling his behavior still when what they should have done was correct his behavior back when he was in high school and I\u2019m sure younger!! Karma can be swift and sweet!! Feeding the person the same poison they served others!! That whole I\u2019m better than you personality doesn\u2019t work in college. \n\nHe better learn how to treat others otherwise he\u2019s going to be a very lonely adult!! As for your parents, this is partially their fault as they allowed him to be a bully and treat people badly and rather than you know parenting him they excused his behavior by saying ohh that\u2019s just how Eric is. Nope, that\u2019s bullshit, that\u2019s how Eric is because your parents allowed him to be a bully!! \n\nDo not feel bad!! You served your brother a big ol spoonful of reality and the truth!! He got a little taste of what he fished out to his friend he insulted. Good on you!! Maybe he needs counseling to help him see how his behavior has led to him feeling lonely and depressed, just how im sure he made others feel!!", "Nta", "The only one who isn't an AH is you.\n\n\"... I made Eric feel even more lonely by being unsupportive and unempathetic\"\n\nNot at all.  I think you were were showing the empathy and support he needed to experience.  Too bad he doesn't know that.", "You see this a lot of course, the big guy/girl in high school gets eaten alive in college.  Then you see the quiet kid, the one everyone picks on in HS blooms in college and becomes a standout.  NTAH on your part.", "NTA. Your parents are absolutely responsible for how they raised him and need to stop enabling him. Frankly, for how he behaved, you had amazing patience with him. \n\nYou were kind enough to tell him the truth with more decency than he deserved. Now, all you can do is live your life. He'll either learn or crash but either way, it's his choice. \n\nBearing the consequences of our actions is one of the life lessons we all need to learn eventually. He's overdue.", "As someone who went to college, the dynamics are different in college\u2014 it\u2019s WAY easier to have a social life.

If anything telling him that might help him in the long run if he's smart enough to make changes.", "NTA. What has happened is because of *his* bad behaviour.

I\u2019m nice to people, but had untreated ADD and socializing by far has been my biggest struggle. I also had trouble keeping some jobs Since medication has happened, it\u2019s like my brain and mouth suddenly have a filter. I no longer blurt out what I\u2019m thinking and interrupt people way less.\n\nWhile ADD may be the reason for how I act, it\u2019s also my responsibility to control and compensate for it because I want a \u201cnormal\u201d life with friends and a career.", "NTA.
