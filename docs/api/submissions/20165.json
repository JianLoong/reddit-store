I know friendships can be different and good friends can also rag on each other. But Eric would go way too far and the things he would say were just mean.\r  \n\r  \nI remember one time, he insulted everything about this other kid. Their appearance, intelligence, interests, religious views, Eric even brought up the kid\u2019s dysfunctional family and made fun of them over it.

Eric then made fun of the kid for leaving early.\r  \n\r  \nAfter his other friends left, I told Eric that he was acting like a bully and it was not okay for him to treat that kid the way he did. Eric made an excuse that \u201cThat\u2019s just my sense of humor\u201d and that anyone is being sensitive if they really take what he says to heart or don\u2019t also find it funny. My parents have honestly enabled this. I brought it up to them and they would just say things like \u201cOh, well that\u2019s Eric for you.\u201d and that the kids who avoided or complained about Eric to the school where overly-sensitive.\r  \n\r  \nEric was able to behave this way and have a good social life in high school.

He finished his freshman year of college last month, but didn\u2019t have a pleasant time socially from what he told me throughout last year. People would work with him for group projects but didn\u2019t really talk or hang out with him outside of class.\r  \n\r  \nEric was talking to me on the phone the other day and told me that he hosted a game night on Jackbox but nobody came.

Most college students have to work during the summer.\r  \n\r  \nEric then accused me of only having friends at my own college because I\u2019m a decently attractive girl, and basically said that there\u2019s no reason anyone would want to hang out with me just for my personality since he\u2019s smart and talented yet his peers won\u2019t hang out with him outside of class. I had enough of it then.\r  \n\r  \nI told Eric that he isn\u2019t in high school anymore. Being mean to people worked when he and his peers were teenagers and had to spend most of their time around each other regardless.

Eric called me a name and hung up. \r  \n\r  \nMy parents called me later and said I was wrong for what I told Eric.

You've tried your best to explain to him why that's no longer working, but he's not receptive to change. \n\nYou really tried to help him, and if he had just listened, things could have improved.

He doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for his actions and now he must suffer the consequences, I cant wait till he joins the workforce.", "NTA.  And Eric minimizing your friendships because you are female is pretty disgusting.  He sounds like an unpleasant person altogether.  You are the only person looking out for him by being honest.

Your assessment was correct - be a shitty person and people will avoid you.\n\nYour parents avoided helping Eric learn this lesson. He's now learning it through personal experience.

Time for your brother to think about his behavior.  This should have been your parents' job through the years, but apparently they are protective of how he has behaved and are expecting you to be the same.  Eric's comments to you weren't exactly kind or considerate so sounds like you were having a pretty raw discussion and that you had some points he needs to think about.  He might not have liked what you told him but sounds like he needed to hear them and that now he needs to give them some serious consideration. This can be done without being unsupportive, just honest.  I assume you are trying to help your brother with his peer issues, not just tear him down.", "NTA.  You kept it real with Eric.", "NTA. It's come time for Eric to learn that being a shitty person doesn't make you popular or cool. The real world is much different than high school. Hopefully, he'll realize his behavior is wrong and learn to treat others the way he wishes to be treated. Shame on your parents for enabling this behavior, but good on you for speaking the truth.", "NTA. He needed to hear that.

Did you tell them what he said to you?", "NTA sounds like he can't find anyone to be his new ego boosting, punching bag- i mean \"friend\" in a new place, so he called you up to do it instead.
