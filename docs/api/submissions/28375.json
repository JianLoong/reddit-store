Last night, I was texting one of her friends, Kate. We were planning me and Jane's 2 year wedding anniversary. I usually don't do big things like this, so I wanted it to be as much of a surprise as possible.\n\nJane saw that I was texting Kate, and asked what I was up to. I said it was nothing. She didn't like this and tried to grab my phone. Obviously, I didn't let her take it.\n\nThen, she got up and left the room, presumably to calm down or text Kate, as she soon texted me asking why Jane was calling her a \"whore\".\n\nMy wife has always had jealousy problems, but never to this degree.\n\nThis morning, she said to me \"You're a fucking asshole\". I tried to explain to her what was going on, but she just walked out for work, and I haven't seen her since.\n\nShe even got her sister to message me, accusing me of being a cheater and to not talk to my wife right now.

And she thinks so little of you both, she drags her family into it. I really don't know how you can have a successful relationship with someone who who does not trust you. It's safe to say her friendship with this woman is forever changed after she called her a \"whore\". As for you, suspicion and jealousy are not a winning combination for a successful marriage. Good luck, you're going to need it.", "Don\u2019t have children with this woman!!!", "Well she doesn\u2019t have the emotional maturity to not jump to conclusions. Tell her the truth, text her screenshots and then give her a bit of hard time like I guess I\u2019m not allowed to plan surprise parties.

NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife is kinda wild here, is this a one time red flag or normal for her?\n\nAnyway, just tell her. Ruin the surprise. Better than her thinking you're a cheater.

With the background of \u2018I don\u2019t usually plan things like this\u2019, which would further explain why the wife is suspicious. For OP to choose the friend to be the only other person to help plan this while nobody else, not even his SIL, knows is a little sus to me. She must be the wife\u2019s ultimate best friend to be the only one involved, so I find it questionable that his wife would immediately text Kate that she\u2019s a \u2018whore\u2019. I think most of us would ask our best friend what\u2019s going on first. Or phone our friend in front of our spouse to ask what\u2019s going on. Im just picturing OP clumsily attempting to accidentally show his wife this post and be like \u2018omg I even used a throwaway so you wouldn\u2019t find out, ah the surprise is ruined. It\u2019s okay no need to be sorry!

Unless you have an actual past history she has no excuse.\n\nI recommend couples therapy, therapy for your wife, and maybe lithium...", "YTA\n\nYou are texting to another woman and behaved like you have secret.\nAnd then you are wondering why your wife thinks you are cheating?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
