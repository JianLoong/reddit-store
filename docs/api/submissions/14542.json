You don't have to eat something if you don't want to. Your mom should stop metaphorically punching herself: she knows that you won't want to eat the type of food she makes and that she'll get upset about it, and then she makes it and tries to get you to eat it anyway. Wasting food? She's the one making the food that she knows won't be eaten.\n\nObviously peoples' calorific needs vary, but 2500 calories a day doesn't sound like you're likely under-eating. Could your mom deliberately be trying to make you overweight?", "NTA but calorie counting and keeping such a grip on your diet like that can be bad for you in the long run and cause EDs.

I know you tried communicating already, and you feel ignored... but keep trying. People have \"love languages\" and hers might be feeding her family.

Your mom may also see herself as the \u201cprovider\u201d and losing this role (even in this small way) may threaten a key element of her identity, especially if you are the oldest. Parents are also human, and so handle stuff poorly. \n\nTry a couple different approaches: \nOverly show your mom appreciation for the things that she does (your laundry, providing other stuff likes roof over your head, etc.). Helps them see this is not a lack of appreciation but connected to an actual goal of yours. \nAvoid bashing their food choices. Educate, not shame. \nShare with them your tracking app and the science behind it. Let them see how serious you are about this. \nShare with them your goals in moving to this nutrition routine, like the underlying goals, not just bulking, but the part you left out-let them see your emotional side that has prompted this - body image, finding a gf, etc. Not many parents object in the face of understanding their child\u2019s raw emotions and challenges.\n\nSomething to possibly share: \n\u201cWhich of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?\u201d Wisdom here. Ignore gendered language, it applies equally to moms and daughters. They need to understand which is the fish and which is the snake. \n\nUltimately, if that does not work, respectfully say you are committed to this and you hope that they can find a way to support you, because you would really love their support.
