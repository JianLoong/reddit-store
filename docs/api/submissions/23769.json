I'm not telling you to leave or end your relationship, if he's willing to get help and you are willing to be committed to him that is your choice. But until you are both able to get help you should not entangle yourself financially with this person. Addiction is a disease that has cascading impacts beyond the actual addict. A therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction can help you to reflect on your own feelings, behaviors and see warning signs, set boundaries, etc. That being said, if this is a deal breaker (and very, very fair if it is) make a plan to safely get out, and do not allow him to make you feel guilty or give him more money, and ensure that your own accounts are separate and not accessible.", "Time to move out and away, you're just asking for lies, debt and more trouble if you stay, certainly if you marry and have kids with him.", "NTA. Obviously. I would be done with this guy", "These are the kind of men who open credit cards in their children\u2019s names and wreck their credit before they\u2019re in double digits. OP, it doesn\u2019t matter what other redeeming qualities he has, just say no tot the sunk cost fallacy and save yourself.", "**> Off-topic!**\n\nOut of curiosity - I've heard that about drowning victims before. I've also heard that if someone is drowning and doing exactly as you described, the best thing to do is to swim *down and away.* Would you agree? (From the perspective of another random person who happens to be in the water, rather than someone attempting rescue.)\n\nI mean it makes sense - the drowning person doesn't want to go down, and I'm probably a strong enough swimmer to get out of arm's reach underwater in most situations. But seeing as you were a professional I'm curious about your opinion!", "That's my big thing -it makes it so stupidly easy to access for people.  No more waiting to get to Vegas, or even Casino-Rama a few times a year, just pick up your phone.", "We used to live 45 minutes from Rama and it wasn't affected by the OLG ban, what a nightmare.\n\nAt least addictions like alcohol and drugs still require a bit more work to access, gambling is far too easy now. I've played the OLG casino games online like twice, because I bought a Lotto Max during lockdown and had 2 bucks left in my account so decided to try my luck. I lost, got annoyed and left lol.", "Yeah no, followed all the rules + ones that didn\u2019t work. \n\nTwo capital letters, a number & a character.\n\nHe is extremely good at this. I am also not his only victim. I am his eldest child\u2019s mom & the last three times he\u2019s sent gift money (he doesn\u2019t send child support, but he pays for gifts) it\u2019s come from baby mama 3\u2019s account.", "NTA. I assume you are young too. You have a chance at a full and happy life. But not with him.  Run, do not walk, away\u2026.", "NTA\n\nEnd it.  Move on.", "NTA my sisters ex wasn\u2019t a bad person but he is a gambling addict. The first time she found out that he\u2019d drained their savings she told him to get help. He said he was and was doing everything possible to get better, she thought it would be ok to still have a joint account as long as she checked it regularly but especially with online stuff the money can be gone so fast. He drained everything a second time and she left. $30k she\u2019s out, plus the heartbreak.", "Nope and unless he gets into an addiction program this will only get worse. I would seriously rethink everything before he drags you down with him. NTA", "Your boyfriend has a gambling addiction. He needs therapy and you need to separate your finances at the very least.", "I\u2019ve heard that the worst addiction is gambling. If you get the house, you will lose it. Loan Sharks will get their money back anyway they can.", "NTA.\n\nOmg. Red alert, red alert. He has an addiction and he needs to get it sorted immediately or you have to run.", "NTA. Dump him.", "NTA Don't believe him. I think he is too immature for you.", "I bet that app will be reinstalled in short order.  You just won\u2019t be able to find it again because he\u2019ll hide it better.  \n\nAITA responses tell people to leave their significant other all the time.  \n\nI\u2019ll just say this.  If you stay with this guy you will be fucking up your entire future.  You now know he gambles behind your back and lies to you.  It\u2019s August.  Almost half of the money he earned this year, 3/8s, has been gambled away.  There is no house deposit.  He\u2019s \u201cborrowing\u201d (he\u2019s never going to pay you back) from you and most likely others.  \n\nIf you accept his \u201csorry\u201d you are fool.  Leave immediately for your own sake.  NTA, unless you stay.", "How much have they spent? I'd really like to know. \n\nAnd you could so easily cut your loses and move on and if they get it together then give a second chance. They could stop their problem before it gets horrible and costs them literally everything. \n\nBut since nobody is rock bottom yet you'll likely stay and they will get worse and then eventually you'll lose a lot trying to help them when they are losing everything. If you ever get into a house with them you'll end up taking the entire financial responsibility alone or even lose the house entirely and waste untold amounts of time and money..easily the rest of your 20s which will essentially put you way behind in life.", "My sons dad was gambling in BC from my couch in Saskatchewan. Where online gambling was not yet legal.", "NTA but absolutely rethink your plans to buy a house with this person.", "NTA. Yeah it sucks he addicted to gambling but all these comments saying leave him are so naive. Open up discussions more and talk it out. If this is the person you want to spend your life with then fight for it and help him understand the consequences of his actions. Yeah things may get bad but as long as you have each other/want each other, you can have many more good times than bad. I\u2019d rather be broke with the one I love than not have them in my life. If you feel your love is that strong then hold onto it.", "It's one looong paragraph. Learn how to write before posting.", " easy there Tonto, plenty of people pull themselves out of addiction before facing homelessness", "That's an interesting way to say you can barely read but ok."]}
