Also assuming the calls are non-negotiable therefore when one is scheduled, all persons honour it?  \n\nCould you entertain yourself whilst he's on the call? Nice bath, glass of wine, mini-pamper then be ready for a film and popcorn afterwards?", "YTA - his work doesn't care that it's your birthday. And as an adult you should understand the importance of a work call.", "YTA \n\nUnless he's deliberately always doing this, he is trying to make money in a situation where you described it as \"saving money.\" He's working hard for both of you. Cut him some slack. He's still spending time with you and you said it yourself, 2 hrs for dinner is more than adequate.", "YTA - he probably really doesn\u2019t want to take this call especially on your birthday, but his job requires him to and he\u2019s trying to help support your family.", "YTA.  We are in the saving money mode.., Hard  to save money with no job.   You already said he has to have phone calls at weird hours because of time differences. Come on is he supposed to spend every minute of your birthday with you ?? Ridiculous- it is a work call.  You should be glad he has a job and is a hard worker.", "YTA I imagine you like your husband having a job, he's informed you of this call prior to your date. It sounds like an important call and sometimes those don't go along with a schedule.", "Yta. \n\nIt's work. And you know his schedule.", "YTA - if it bothers you so much, go to dinner another night.", "I have \"mandatory\" late/early calls on occasion.  Also due to time differences for a multi-national company.  However, other people skip these when they have vacation or family matters  to attend.  But my situation may be much more lax than your SO's.\n\nGoing with NAH as you clearly just want some alone time with husband; however, I don't know how obligating his calls are to slap an AH label on him.  If he's the CFO/site controller (head accountant) and it's the quarterly financial update, then yeah, Y T A for interfering.", "NAH. It's ok to be upset, it's not ok to throw it in his face unless he does this often. Else, it sometimes happens and it's shitty; the only important thing is he doesn't do it on purpose.", "YTA. It's your birthday. Your bf is taking you out to dinner. Nice. Many people don't even get a card, so count yourself lucky. Because of time differences, and his JOB,  he has to take a business call TWO hours into a dinner reservation. By that time, you've eaten, conversed, celebrated. Why couldn't you continue the celebration after the call? Why did his focus on you have to be uninterrupted? It's your birthday, but life all over the world goes on. Everything doesn't stop because on that particular day, x number of years ago, you were born.", "Eh, you aren't an asshole for wanting to relax a little bit after your birthday dinner, but since these types of meetings take place frequently, don't make him skp it and potentially get in trouble.", "You'd think someone trying to save money wouldn't want their spouse to jeopardize their job.  Grow up. YTA", "YTA.\n\nWhy do you feel the need to stay for 2 hours at a restaurant, after your meal? And why not relax AFTER he's done if that's still not enough? \n\nAnd it is work related. It's a call, not a full blown meeting where I doubt he'd have to go to the office. Agree with your mom. It's a Monday, can't cater ppl's jobs for your bday. Especially as long as you're expecting it to last...", "YTA How are you old enough to marry?", "NTA. If he can't take an evening off to celebrate with you what's the point of making money? All these people saying he will lose his job if he doesn't take ONE work call are bootlicking morons.", "YTA The world doesn't stop because it's your birthday.", "YTA- But in this case it is understandable. So if on a scale, you just ticked on the YTA side. \n\nIt's your Birthday. We all want to be special on it. And I am willing to bet he is aware this sucks for you. If he scheduled and if it was important, then unfortunate. I would bet he had some small talks to try to avoid it too. \n\nSo yeah you are totally allowed to be upset. Try to make the most of it, and if he sounds like a great husband, he is probably working on making it up to you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Birthday by the way!", "INFO :how long do the calls last? \n\nThe older we get the more we must be understanding of our adult loved ones obligations. \n\nYes he could not take calls tonight, but you two could have celebrated this past weekend with no interruption or this coming weekend. \n\nAs we get older our birthdays on weekdays are sometimes like any other day and that\u2019s ok .\n\nI hope your husband can have some fun after his call but it is understandable if you all go to bed bc you may have work in the am. You\u2019ll be ok \n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY! NTA", "YTA. Are you 12? It\u2019s your birthday you\u2019re getting a dinner out, more than many get. If he needs to take a work call be grateful that he has a job and realize that your birthday is not more important than earning the money needed to pay for the dinner!", "Info - I guess it depends on the type of meeting it is. If it's \"shippable\" or not. I know if my husband would to do it I'd be mad most probably, because I know he can work around most of the times (unless emergency like if he's on call etc...). But it's easy to know as we're doing the same job!", "NTA, and all these folks saying you are need to get some rational work-life balance. Work is important, but family is too, and being disappointed when work tramples over family time is totally reasonable. Having boundaries around your work life is healthy, and it sounds like your spouse has trouble either establishing or enforcing them. \n\nI don\u2019t think birthdays are very important, and neither does my spouse, but if they DID, you bet it would be a priority for me, because *they* are a priority for me. If I drew the short straw and had to work an event on their birthday (entirely plausible, this year I got the on-call all weekend for their birthday) I would lead with an apology, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry spouse, I have to take this event/call/meeting for xyz reasons, I know it\u2019s your birthday and you wanted to spend it together, can we rain check? Can I make it up to you with a nice night later this week?\u201d My bet is that, assuming he doesn\u2019t blow off everything important to you, you\u2019d have had a less negative reaction if it had been presented with acknowledgment of the disappointment, because it still makes you feel prioritized.", "NAH but did he let work know he had plans?", "omg yes YTA", "YTA. He\u2019s not skipping dinner to hang out with mates. It\u2019s to do with his job.", "YTA. I take it you are about 5 years old? It will not be any less your birthday just because he has to take a call. How are your money saving plans going to go, if he can't do his job properly because of your selfish needs?", "YTA! Umm... if my or my wife's birthday falls on a boring Monday and we are busy with work, kids schedules, etc. guess what? We'll do it on a Friday evening or weekend! Just because it's your birthday doesn't mean you HAVE TO go out to dinner THAT DAY.  The call was for his job and you stated that it's normal for him to take calls at 8pm your time so yeah you'rE YTA regardless if it's your birthday or not.", "YTA. Children don't expect their parents to skip work for birthdays because even children understand that the food on the table doesn't pay for itself.", "Mostly NTA, but might need some context.\n\nI have had this conversation with my wife 1000 times.\n\nEvery day we make a choice between priorities, our work or our family.  Sometimes work needs to take priority.  Sometimes family does. \n\nPeople choose work too often because they feel more comfortable telling a family member \"no\" than telling work \"no\".  The reality is that in most cases, barring a very important meeting, your husband can say, \"Hey, I have plans for my wife's birthday and can't make this meeting\" - 95% of the time, everyone is OK with that.\n\nIf it was an absolute crunch-time project or executive meeting, I might understand not skipping, but in most cases, most meetings are able to be rearranged.", "YTA. Boo effing hoo, cry me a river.", "Mild YTA.  Work is important as it pays the bills and keeps a roof over your head.  It's not great that he has an 8pm call on your birthday, but that wasn't his decision and if his job is otherwise good it's not worth him getting in trouble or changing jobs because of it.", "You have the right to be disappointed. It was something to look forward to. \n\nCalling him rude... no. If you are sure he is doing it because he has no way to get out of the call, reschedule it, let a colleague do it etc., then you don't get to call him rude.", "YTA\n\nYou guys have food on the table because of those work calls\u2026", "YTA. My husband owns his own company, so I do understand wanting quality time(especially on your birthday) without him having to work. HOWEVER, as you stated, you are in money saving mode. He needs to work to save money. Be thankful you get 2 hours to enjoy your birthday dinner together, be thankful he has a job, be thankful he is doing what he can to save with you for the feature. Yes, it's frustrating, and you can feel like you are in second place, but if you vocalize that and give him ideas of how he can still make you feel special, it'll help you get through those times. Remember you are both working towards something and you will both have to sacrifice at times to get there.", "YTA, the world doesn't revolve around you. He did not cancel the plans in full, he has a job and as you said you are in money saving mode. So getting him in trouble at work so he can focus 100% on you seems ass backwards", "NAH, I get how you feel, I get these calls too\u2026 I\u2019m someone who has to be on calls like this as I\u2019m a) not in the same country as head office and b) not as high on the totem pole, they are hard to get out of.\n\nIt sucks, I\u2019ve had to reschedule/skip dinners because of this as sometimes it is unavoidable.\n\nHowever, he can always ask about trying to keep them to a minimum, or at least trying to show that it is late for him. I generally take these calls from home, point the camera outside my window so they can see it\u2019s getting dark. In some extreme cases I stay in the office as we have motion sensitive lights, it\u2019s very effective when the others can see that you\u2019re the only one there and the lights have all gone off except for the one in your section. It does depend on who he works with, some will care, others will not.", "YTA & sound like a self centered psycho", "NTA.  I know how important birthdays are and you want to be made to feel special on that day, even if it is a simple dinner and a movie at home afterwards.  Seems like your husband needs to find a better work/life balance.  Without knowing what he does, it just seems to me he could have put this call off for one day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
