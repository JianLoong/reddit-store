Super exciting. Im super happy for her. She decided she wanted to go through all of our old stuff to see if there\u2019s any old toys she can give to her baby to cut down on costs or just save in general for when it\u2019s older. While looking we found our old American girl dolls which in combination between me and her we have about 26 and a ton of accessories. She decided they\u2019d be the perfect thing to give to her kid. The thing is in those 26 about 20 were mine and 2 were share, were 3 years apart but she grew out of dolls way earlier than I did, so after a few years of getting them she just asked for other gifts when for every holiday, birthday, operation ect I\u2019d ask every relative for one and I wanted to save them for my future kids, at least the majority of them. It may seem stupid but I\u2019m very sentimental. I immediately told her that she can\u2019t just take the stuff that\u2019s mostly mine because I plan on saving it for my kid and because even at 21, she\u2019s still incredibly spoiled after some arguing, she ends up tattling on me to my mother. I\u2019d like to add we both still live at home except for when I\u2019m at college. My mom ended up getting mad at me because I don\u2019t have a boyfriend or a baby in the forseeable future and this is now. Meanwhile those dolls where a huge part of my childhood. I explained that I don\u2019t want to keep her 4, and she could even give her kid the 2 we shared, but the others were rightfully mine, and I got them for every occasion, gift and even spent every penny I earns on them and their accessories until I was 13, and that it\u2019s a sentimental thing for me and it\u2019s not my fault she didn\u2019t have any toys she was sentimentally attached to to pass down. We ended up settling that I was right but my sister won\u2019t talk to me because she thinks I\u2019m a spoiled brat because I want to give my future kid something I really cared about, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687409215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ftno9/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_give_my_dolls_to/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those are your dolls and people collect stuff that they just don't want to get rid of.  \nI think the 4-6 dolls she'd give to her kid would be enough but I guess not? She's spoiled, keep your dolls.", "NTA - her kid having FOUR will be plenty. I\u2019m right with you and treasured the two I had. These are definitely sentimental objects and you are right to save them for your own kids", "NTA\n\nThey are yours. Keep them. She\u2019s being an entitled jerk.\n\nEven if you never have kids, those dolls are yours. They have sentimental value for you.", "NTA\n\nThey are yours to do as you please.", "NTA your sister seems to be spoiled. Keep those dolls for your future child. Now that being said i personally would still probably give few of your dolls for her baby since you will be an aunt. But that\u2019s just up to you and not something you have to do.", "NTA. 20 American girl dolls are more of a collectible at that number. So wanting to keep them in good condition as well as wanting to pass down that collection to your daughter is reasonable. But how do you know your daughter will want this huge collection? At the same time why does your sister need so many to give to her kid? No guarantee there that her kid will like them either. 2 American girl dolls is more than enough for her kid. \n\nBottom line you asked for many of them over the years and she doesn\u2019t have a right to take them. She really does sound spoiled. You\u2019re the collector, you\u2019re the owner, NTA.", "NtA. The dolls are yours to begin with. Do as you please . Just to share , I remember an aunt who collected a  couple of specific dolls she always wanted as a child. She wouldn\u2019t even let her daughters play with the dolls and was just in display . When she died the husband offered the dolls to the daughters and they don\u2019t want anything to do with  the dolls . It was shipped to my aunts sister who donated the dolls because nobody in the family wanted it  too.", "NTA, check into self-storage in your area.  They can be as little as $25 per month (less if you pay a year in advance.  Move you treasures there. When it is in your name only you can access it.", "NTA. You guys had 26 american girl dolls?!

It was for her kids not for her, why did you use that occasion to insult her telling her she was spoiled?", "NTA \n\nAlso...I had an American Girl Doll growing up (Kit). She was nice but honestly, I found her hard to play with and I was about 8 or 9. Your sister's idea of giving 26 to a *baby* seems mad to me. \n\nNot to mention some of those dolls can go for a pretty penny now that I think Kit and Molly are out of circulation. So does your sister really want the dolls for her kid or does she want them because she's found out that pregnancy is expensive and she might have thought the dolls could help her (which if it was just her dolls, it would be no fault of her's. She's 21, I doubt she's got enough savings to help even if she does have a partner--which OP didn't say but I'm going to assume dad's in the picture for future kiddo. But wanting *all* the dolls crossed a line especially if sis wanted to sell them.)", "NTA for sure.", "NTA, she's only whining that you're spoiled because you're not giving into her spoiled demands.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nSince they\u2019re your dolls. Plus there\u2019s no way of knowing if your sister\u2019s kid will even like dolls when they\u2019re old enough to play with them. My daughter has zero interest in dolls but is obsessed with dinosaurs and mega blocks. \n\nBesides what the heck is a newborn gonna do with 26 dolls?????", "Right? 26 dolls to give to a baby\u2026 they\u2019re more of a collection at that point. Mint in box as it were", "This ^. Just so they don't disappear one day.   \n\nNTA", "That\u2019s not at all what mint in box means? It means something has been kept in pristine, unopened, unused condition as if it just came from the factory.Sounds like OP used and loved her dolls a lot!", "The baby won\u2019t even be able to play with the dolls for several years at minimum. I don\u2019t know why she is getting so worked up. You are NTA and keep your collection nice and safe.", "NTA. And I wonder if she actually wanted to sell the dolls. But either way, they are yours to do with what you'd like. I'd consider hiding them away.", "NTA - see how much those dolls go for nowadays and then tell your mom. \n\nThen tell them both as 20 of them are your property you expect to be paid the value of them. Watch how quickly they'll back track, because they might end up having to sell an organ to pay for it depending on the doll and its condition", "NTA\n\nMy sister collected Barbies. I had Sindy and Tressie.\n\nWhen I had my daughter, she was allowed to play with my sister\u2019s Barbies, but not to take them home.\n\nMy sister only had a son. She still has her Barbie\u2019s. She is now 60 years old.", "I was just using that to mean that they\u2019re a collectors item. I know they played with them as kids but\u2026 it was just a joke really lol", "NTA\nBe careful though. Those dolls might \"mysteriously\" disappear.", "NTA. The number of dolls your sister has is plenty! Truthfully, these dolls are better for older girls to begin with. I bought my daughter pre-owned AG dolls prior to getting new ones to see if she would take care of them. Maybe, if you can afford to, get her a Bitty Baby for her baby shower. Start your niece's own AG doll collection, with a doll more age appropriate for a young child.\n\nMy daughter only has 2 American Girl dolls, Samantha and Nellie, The Best Friend set. It's sentimental to both of us as I had promised her for YEARS that I would take her to Chicago and have an American Girl day together. In 2006, we were able to do that. I spent about $1000 that day on the 2 dolls, and a bunch of clothes for them. We had lunch, saw the play, everything! I was so much fun for her, and we still cherish that memory together. Now that she's an married woman, those dolls are kept in a temperature-controlled storage room. She's saving them for her future children, if she has any.", "I think id still be horrified to find 26 dolls randomly", "NTA and im so glad you got it sorted that  she wasn't able to take them but to be honest please lock them up and put them somewhere she can't get to them cuz i have a feeling once you go back to college they will disappear into your sisters belongings.", "NTA and definitely store your dolls somewhere else. Your sister, who you say lives with your parents, will definitely give your dolls to her baby when you're not around.", "You are right. Obviously. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nKids aren\u2019t mature enough to have American girl doll stuff until age four or five at least.\n\nMost people have things from their childhood that they want to keep forever. This is yours.", "If you care about these dolls that much you better secure them, because she will try to take them. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is acting like an entitled brat", "NTA babies can\u2019t even play with dolls like that so it\u2019s weird she wants to take them at all.", "Can you pack up those dolls and take them somewhere safe where your sister and mother  don't have access?\n\nA friends house for instance?  Perhaps a TRUSTED relative?\n\nThis is your childhood, and you describe you sister as a golden child.  \n\nAmerican girls dolls should not be for toddler, but for older girls.\n\nNTA", "NTA go NC with your sister and hide the dolls. She\u2019s going to steal them from you.", "NTA. But if this hasn't been suggested already, you need to find somewhere to lock those dolls up. A friends house. Storage. Somewhere your sister doesn't have access to. Or I bet that those dolls are going to go \"missing\" in the future.", "Nt\n\nFour is more than enough.....I don't even want my kid to have more than 4 barbies....not to mention her babies not even going to be old enough to give a crap for another 3-5 years", "NTA you forwent other gifts for the dolls.   If you had asked for other things she wouldn\u2019t be able to claim them for her baby. You should stand your ground.", "NTA. Those dolls are flipping expensive and a newborn can't play with one anyway. Much less 26 of them.", "NTA. And this is only the beginning hunh? She's going to demand even more as her pregnancy progresses it looks like.", "Also American girl dolls have a high resell value and if you have any of the original dolls they are worth bank.", "NTA, those are your things.", "I\u2019m thinking about it already!", "See, I was thinking about it, and I know this is just petty as hell, but as soon as she went to tattle on me like a large child I was like nope. But I probably will give the kid some when It gets a little older maybe one or two, a baby can\u2019t do anything with American girl dolls, they\u2019re very hard plastic and heavy for a baby, an infant should be playing with softer dolls at that age, I\u2019d wait till the kids a little older.", "I want to add bc I didn\u2019t, I wrote this very late last night bc I was mad so I didn\u2019t add in some stuff. I\u2019m willing to let the kid play with them ofc, hopefully when I have a kid one day they\u2019ll play together! I just want my things I saved for my kids to go to them! And I\u2019ll make them share when I have them!", "A lot have sentimental value to me, and honestly if she was nice about it, I would have sorted them out and gave her more that I wasn\u2019t as attached to, but she immediately went to the tattle tale game like a toddler. I also want to keep all 20 incase god for bid I\u2019m not financially stable later on, I\u2019m attached to id say 12 or so give or take, the others are mine to sell if I have to. They go for a lot of money, and I mean I collected them, I saved up for them.", "Yeah I\u2019m starting to assume she\u2019s trying to sell bc she tends to do things like that. Once she tried to convince me I don\u2019t use my Nintendo switch so she could sell it (I used it a decent amt) and same with my hoverboard scooter thing as kids, so it\u2019s honestly not far fetch and idk how I didn\u2019t see that.", "I HAVE NO IDEA, as much as I loved those dolls I also had sm nightmares abt them, that poor baby would never be able to sleep \ud83d\ude2d", "I also wonder abt the motive.", "The kid is free to play with anything here whenever she wants, but she\u2019s not even born yet, and my sisters planning on moving out soon. A baby can\u2019t play with with AG dolls. But when she\u2019s older it\u2019s fine if she plays with them!", "Aw the bitty baby idea is so cute, honestly I might just have to!", "This is such a sweet story! I\u2019ve always wanted one but my parents said they were too expensive. I think $100 for a doll. I have a daughter now! She\u2019s 3\u2026 we may have to wait to go to the store. \ud83d\ude05 I actually live in chicago!", "Let me rephrase that part a big, I knew where they were, she didn\u2019t, they were in a closet where I kept them but when we were looking for stuff she didn\u2019t rlly have any idea where any old toys where, but I did, just bc I was a big collector as a kid, and extremely sentimental and was a bit of a late bloomer so i stopped playing with most of them after like 13.", "I was thinking abt a storage locker of some type!", "Trying to look into storage lockers and stuff rn!", "Believe me my mom KNOWS how expensive they are, she actually used to urge me to keep them as a kid in better condition bc I could \u201csell them on the future\u201d so her reaction was kinda wild to me.", "They were mine, I collected them, and wanted them for my future kids, she was free to give her dolls to her kid", "Definitely not mint in the box LOL\ud83d\ude2d", "definitely a good idea with a lock"]}
