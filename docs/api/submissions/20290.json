While looking we found our old American girl dolls which in combination between me and her we have about 26 and a ton of accessories. She decided they\u2019d be the perfect thing to give to her kid. The thing is in those 26 about 20 were mine and 2 were share, were 3 years apart but she grew out of dolls way earlier than I did, so after a few years of getting them she just asked for other gifts when for every holiday, birthday, operation ect I\u2019d ask every relative for one and I wanted to save them for my future kids, at least the majority of them. It may seem stupid but I\u2019m very sentimental. I immediately told her that she can\u2019t just take the stuff that\u2019s mostly mine because I plan on saving it for my kid and because even at 21, she\u2019s still incredibly spoiled after some arguing, she ends up tattling on me to my mother.

She was nice but honestly, I found her hard to play with and I was about 8 or 9. Your sister's idea of giving 26 to a *baby* seems mad to me. \n\nNot to mention some of those dolls can go for a pretty penny now that I think Kit and Molly are out of circulation. So does your sister really want the dolls for her kid or does she want them because she's found out that pregnancy is expensive and she might have thought the dolls could help her (which if it was just her dolls, it would be no fault of her's. She's 21, I doubt she's got enough savings to help even if she does have a partner--which OP didn't say but I'm going to assume dad's in the picture for future kiddo.

It means something has been kept in pristine, unopened, unused condition as if it just came from the factory.Sounds like OP used and loved her dolls a lot!", "The baby won\u2019t even be able to play with the dolls for several years at minimum.

Those dolls might \"mysteriously\" disappear.", "NTA. The number of dolls your sister has is plenty! Truthfully, these dolls are better for older girls to begin with. I bought my daughter pre-owned AG dolls prior to getting new ones to see if she would take care of them. Maybe, if you can afford to, get her a Bitty Baby for her baby shower. Start your niece's own AG doll collection, with a doll more age appropriate for a young child.\n\nMy daughter only has 2 American Girl dolls, Samantha and Nellie, The Best Friend set. It's sentimental to both of us as I had promised her for YEARS that I would take her to Chicago and have an American Girl day together. In 2006, we were able to do that. I spent about $1000 that day on the 2 dolls, and a bunch of clothes for them. We had lunch, saw the play, everything! I was so much fun for her, and we still cherish that memory together. Now that she's an married woman, those dolls are kept in a temperature-controlled storage room. She's saving them for her future children, if she has any.", "I think id still be horrified to find 26 dolls randomly", "NTA and im so glad you got it sorted that  she wasn't able to take them but to be honest please lock them up and put them somewhere she can't get to them cuz i have a feeling once you go back to college they will disappear into your sisters belongings.", "NTA and definitely store your dolls somewhere else.

If you had asked for other things she wouldn\u2019t be able to claim them for her baby. You should stand your ground.", "NTA. Those dolls are flipping expensive and a newborn can't play with one anyway. Much less 26 of them.", "NTA. And this is only the beginning hunh?

But I probably will give the kid some when It gets a little older maybe one or two, a baby can\u2019t do anything with American girl dolls, they\u2019re very hard plastic and heavy for a baby, an infant should be playing with softer dolls at that age, I\u2019d wait till the kids a little older.", "I want to add bc I didn\u2019t, I wrote this very late last night bc I was mad so I didn\u2019t add in some stuff. I\u2019m willing to let the kid play with them ofc, hopefully when I have a kid one day they\u2019ll play together! I just want my things I saved for my kids to go to them!

I also want to keep all 20 incase god for bid I\u2019m not financially stable later on, I\u2019m attached to id say 12 or so give or take, the others are mine to sell if I have to. They go for a lot of money, and I mean I collected them, I saved up for them.", "Yeah I\u2019m starting to assume she\u2019s trying to sell bc she tends to do things like that. Once she tried to convince me I don\u2019t use my Nintendo switch so she could sell it (I used it a decent amt) and same with my hoverboard scooter thing as kids, so it\u2019s honestly not far fetch and idk how I didn\u2019t see that.", "I HAVE NO IDEA, as much as I loved those dolls I also had sm nightmares abt them, that poor baby would never be able to sleep \ud83d\ude2d", "I also wonder abt the motive.", "The kid is free to play with anything here whenever she wants, but she\u2019s not even born yet, and my sisters planning on moving out soon.

I\u2019ve always wanted one but my parents said they were too expensive. I think $100 for a doll. I have a daughter now!

I\u2019m 60 and I still collect dolls and I didn\u2019t let my daughter have but 2 of my favorites when she was little. Your sister should have her dolls and you can offer to let her have the share dolls since you have so many of your own. They really won\u2019t even be appropriate for her child for a few years anyway. And, if this is the first grandbaby, I\u2019m sure this child will receive more than its share of gifts, including dolls, and other toys.", "Normally I don\u2019t comment on these sorta of posts I just lurk but American girl dolls are a thing I happen to know a thing or two about, as I was super DUPER into them when I was younger (I\u2019m 20 now). I only have about 5-6 dolls in total and I still love them, but they only stay as collectibles as they should considering I\u2019m a 20 year old woman. I got my first doll which was Sage, and if I\u2019m doing the math correctly, I was around 9 or ten, and I never really played with her that much, despite how much I adored her. I just dressed her up in other clothes my parents would get for me, maybe that\u2019s considered playing, idk. But the thing is, those dolls are are to play with due to how big they are. They\u2019re more of for dressing up and looking at, and even for dressing up it takes an older kid. American girl dolls are specifically not meant for younger kids. They even have two different dolls lines that are catered towards younger kids because American girl dolls for decades have been recommended for 8 and up due to large size and heavy plastics used. What on earth what was your sister thinking giving 26\u2013 hell even one American girl dolls to a toddler. If she knew anything about them she would know how bad of any idea that is. The baby would either destroy the doll, or completely ignore it because well it\u2019s a baby, and the doll is about the same size as the baby. American girl dolls are NOT baby toys. Where would all those dolls even go? I\u2019m starting to think that other comment was onto something that she just wants to sell them, which if you want to do one day is fine, but they\u2019re not her dolls, not her money. This is basically a long winded way of saying she\u2019s being ridiculous and you\u2019re totally in the right. Even if these were dolls that were meant for young kids, which they aren\u2019t, at the end of the day, they\u2019re YOUR toys. You get the say. Not her. \n\nNTA.", "NTA come join us on the AG collectors sub!", "NTA, but if you can remove the dolls from your parents home, do. Sounds like your mother is winding up to give them to your sister regardless of your opinion. \n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, I\u2019d suggest removing myself from the home too. There\u2019s absolutely no way that this conflict will end at dolls. I think you\u2019ll find you\u2019re about to be expected to be a \u2018good aunt\u2019 and babysit regularly. Personally, I\u2019d be making some preemptive plans.", "NTA. Your sister needs to be more concerned about providing necessary things for her baby and not dolls she can\u2019t use right now.", "You really need to box those up, and store them where your sister cannot get them.", "NTA\n\nYou were very reasonable about the distribution of the dolls. Since you both live in the same household, but you won\u2019t be there when you are away at college I suggest getting a storage unit or a lockable chest to keep your sister from taking them when you\u2019re not around.", "NTA\n\nI had Madame Alexander dolls when I was a kid - this predates American Girl Dolls as high end expensive dolls.\n\nI kept them of course - you are young so why in the world isn't it feasible that you might have a daughter", "NTA. I'm in my thirties and I have a couple of things from my childhood that I kept for the memories. I don't plan on having children or giving them away, but I have fond memories of them so I want to keep them. Even if you weren't planning to have kids later to pass on your collection to they can't make you give them to your sister child if you don't want to. I wouldn't leave them were they can be found to be on the safe. I don't trust your sister to not take them anyway.", "NTA also those dolls are expensive af if you decide to give her more I'd suggest charging her", "Her kid could even end up hating these dolls to play with at all. \n\nI loved baby dolls but I hated Barbie\u2019s. I \u201ctattooed\u201d, scalped and then beheaded every one I got (not really sure why or why my mom wasn\u2019t horrified by the implications, but whatever). \n\nSo basically instead of the dolls being lovingly played with, they could end up abused and destroyed and the sister would be like \u201csorry op, guess you don\u2019t get to use them for your kids, no biggy!\u201d", "> The thing is in those 26 about 20 were mine and 2 were share\n\nRight there, in the post", "Yup. I too was a doll destroyer. Ripped the heads off of my sister's Barbies. Sorry sis.\n\nOP, you have no idea whether your niece or nephew will like dolls or trucks or bugs or sports or art, kids are all different!

Put your important items in a storage unit immediately. Your sister sounds incredibly entitled and I would not put it past her or your mom to just steal your stuff.", "With that I 100% agree. I just googled what kind of dolls these are. And I have to say that I wouldn\u2019t give such dolls to a baby. And honestly these dolls look to me like they are for collecting not really for playing. So If you feel comfortable giving some to the child as a gift when it grows up it\u2019s up to you.", "I *deeply* craved a Bitty Baby doll as a kid but I always thought it was too expensive to ask for. As an adult it has been absolutely wonderful buying one for each of my kids and making adorable little clothes for them. <3 A couple were decent-condition used ones on eBay for half the cost of new ones, and just a light scrub with a baking soda+water paste freshened up the vinyl parts quite nicely!", "Ah makes sense.. thanks for the clarification", "Your sister is putting the horse before the cart- I mean her kid shouldn\u2019t be playing with dolls that expensive until she or he is like 5 at the youngest", "Horses are supposed to go before the cart. You got your idiom backwards.", "Thanks!"]}
