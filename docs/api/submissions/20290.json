Super exciting. Im super happy for her. She decided she wanted to go through all of our old stuff to see if there\u2019s any old toys she can give to her baby to cut down on costs or just save in general for when it\u2019s older. While looking we found our old American girl dolls which in combination between me and her we have about 26 and a ton of accessories. She decided they\u2019d be the perfect thing to give to her kid. The thing is in those 26 about 20 were mine and 2 were share, were 3 years apart but she grew out of dolls way earlier than I did, so after a few years of getting them she just asked for other gifts when for every holiday, birthday, operation ect I\u2019d ask every relative for one and I wanted to save them for my future kids, at least the majority of them. It may seem stupid but I\u2019m very sentimental. I immediately told her that she can\u2019t just take the stuff that\u2019s mostly mine because I plan on saving it for my kid and because even at 21, she\u2019s still incredibly spoiled after some arguing, she ends up tattling on me to my mother. I\u2019d like to add we both still live at home except for when I\u2019m at college. My mom ended up getting mad at me because I don\u2019t have a boyfriend or a baby in the forseeable future and this is now. Meanwhile those dolls where a huge part of my childhood. I explained that I don\u2019t want to keep her 4, and she could even give her kid the 2 we shared, but the others were rightfully mine, and I got them for every occasion, gift and even spent every penny I earns on them and their accessories until I was 13, and that it\u2019s a sentimental thing for me and it\u2019s not my fault she didn\u2019t have any toys she was sentimentally attached to to pass down. We ended up settling that I was right but my sister won\u2019t talk to me because she thinks I\u2019m a spoiled brat because I want to give my future kid something I really cared about, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687409215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ftno9/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_give_my_dolls_to/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those are your dolls and people collect stuff that they just don't want to get rid of.  \nI think the 4-6 dolls she'd give to her kid would be enough but I guess not? She's spoiled, keep your dolls.", "NTA - her kid having FOUR will be plenty. I\u2019m right with you and treasured the two I had. These are definitely sentimental objects and you are right to save them for your own kids", "NTA\n\nThey are yours. Keep them. She\u2019s being an entitled jerk.\n\nEven if you never have kids, those dolls are yours. They have sentimental value for you.", "NTA\n\nThey are yours to do as you please.", "NTA your sister seems to be spoiled. Keep those dolls for your future child. Now that being said i personally would still probably give few of your dolls for her baby since you will be an aunt. But that\u2019s just up to you and not something you have to do.", "NTA. 20 American girl dolls are more of a collectible at that number. So wanting to keep them in good condition as well as wanting to pass down that collection to your daughter is reasonable. But how do you know your daughter will want this huge collection? At the same time why does your sister need so many to give to her kid? No guarantee there that her kid will like them either. 2 American girl dolls is more than enough for her kid. \n\nBottom line you asked for many of them over the years and she doesn\u2019t have a right to take them. She really does sound spoiled. You\u2019re the collector, you\u2019re the owner, NTA.", "NtA. The dolls are yours to begin with. Do as you please . Just to share , I remember an aunt who collected a  couple of specific dolls she always wanted as a child. She wouldn\u2019t even let her daughters play with the dolls and was just in display . When she died the husband offered the dolls to the daughters and they don\u2019t want anything to do with  the dolls . It was shipped to my aunts sister who donated the dolls because nobody in the family wanted it  too.", "NTA, check into self-storage in your area.  They can be as little as $25 per month (less if you pay a year in advance.  Move you treasures there. When it is in your name only you can access it.", "NTA. You guys had 26 american girl dolls?! I don't know that I'd need to hold on to 20, but they're yours to do with as you wish", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was for her kids not for her, why did you use that occasion to insult her telling her she was spoiled?", "NTA \n\nAlso...I had an American Girl Doll growing up (Kit). She was nice but honestly, I found her hard to play with and I was about 8 or 9. Your sister's idea of giving 26 to a *baby* seems mad to me. \n\nNot to mention some of those dolls can go for a pretty penny now that I think Kit and Molly are out of circulation. So does your sister really want the dolls for her kid or does she want them because she's found out that pregnancy is expensive and she might have thought the dolls could help her (which if it was just her dolls, it would be no fault of her's. She's 21, I doubt she's got enough savings to help even if she does have a partner--which OP didn't say but I'm going to assume dad's in the picture for future kiddo. But wanting *all* the dolls crossed a line especially if sis wanted to sell them.)", "NTA for sure.", "NTA, she's only whining that you're spoiled because you're not giving into her spoiled demands.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nSince they\u2019re your dolls. Plus there\u2019s no way of knowing if your sister\u2019s kid will even like dolls when they\u2019re old enough to play with them. My daughter has zero interest in dolls but is obsessed with dinosaurs and mega blocks. \n\nBesides what the heck is a newborn gonna do with 26 dolls?????", "Right? 26 dolls to give to a baby\u2026 they\u2019re more of a collection at that point. Mint in box as it were", "This ^. Just so they don't disappear one day.   \n\nNTA", "That\u2019s not at all what mint in box means? It means something has been kept in pristine, unopened, unused condition as if it just came from the factory.Sounds like OP used and loved her dolls a lot!"]}
