So another good friend (Tim) of my fianc\u00e9 organised the bachelor party. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is at work right know and Tim came to pick something up. So I opened the door and we chatted for a bit. He then said something along the lines of \u201cMake sure your man packs enough dollar bills\u201d and jokingly replied \u201cfor the stripclub?\u201d He looked me dead in the eye and said: \u201cObviously.\u201d\n\nI asked twice and he repeatedly told me that he was serious he booked time in a stripclub for the bachelor party. \n\nFor me going into a strip club is cheating(I know everybody has their own opinion and mine is this. My fianc\u00e9 knows about that and would never plan something like that). \n\nSo I politely asked Tim to cancel whatever reservation this is, as we agreed to not do that and as I told him multiple times I consider it cheating. \n\nHe told me that he wouldn\u2019t change it and that my fianc\u00e9 deserved one last free night. \nI told him he could either cancel right know or I would tell my fianc\u00e9 about the plans and asking him to miss out on it (and I know he would because he would never want to cheat on me, as I would never cheat on him). \n\nTim said I was a control freak and had no right to decide this and that I would be a mayor AH if I ruined the surprise for my fianc\u00e9. \n\nWell I think I am in the right and I will tell my fianc\u00e9 about it, when he gets home. \n\nBut am I really the AH for doing so?\n\nEdit: First of all: Thank you to allconstructive and polite people sharing their opinions and judgments. \nNow two things: \n\n1. I did not ask if you think I am to young to get married or if you feel I am insecure or if you think it\u2019s cheating or if I am delusional for seeing it as cheating. I simply asked if I am the AH for telling my fianc\u00e9, nothing more. I also don\u2019t appreciate being insulted over private chat messages either. Please stop it. \n\n2. My fianc\u00e9 came home, I told him what happened and he asked if I was joking about the stripclub being part of the party plan. I repeated Tim\u2019s words to my fianc\u00e9. He messaged him, telling him that he won\u2019t attend in a stripclub as he told him before. They fought for about ten minutes on the phone and from what I got Tim caved and said he would cancel the strip club but called me a controlling b\u2019tch. This is when my fianc\u00e9 lost his shit and uninvited Tim from bachelor party and wedding. \n\nWell so there will be no strippers and I will call his best friend josh and will see if their still can be a bachelor party even without Tim. My fianc\u00e9 is currently picking up takeout and I am talking to josh.\n\nEdit 2: We ate a nice takeout (garlic naan and curry) and I made a plan with josh. Turns out he always planned to come a bit early to surprise my fianc\u00e9 at his bachelor party but didn\u2019t knew what Tim planned. Hebekunst knew when it would be. We talked about some nice ideas and josh will think about them and put them in order and message me so I can book the things.

Sure, he can live his life how he wants to, but he also can't force you to be okay with it. If you aren't okay with it, and you tell him that, which you have, and he clearly goes out and violates that, he can't be surprised if you peace out and go find someone who matches up with your values.

So what easier way then to take them to a strip club, drug them legally (alcohol is classified as a drug, it's classified as a CNS depressant), whisper poison in the ear and if the groom takes the bait and winds up in a position, they can swoop in and say things like 'maybe you don't really love her' etc and still get to keep the groom as a friend. If the groom doesn't take the bait, then guys like Tim will just become that one friend that always has to make a comment about the 'ball and chain'.\n\nOverall, I don't think this would be a serious case of what went down in a past post where the groomsmen set the groom up to be assaulted.

Plus, this is his bachelor party, he will get a lap dance from a stripper and possibly more, that\u2019s not just \u201clooking at boobs\u201d. She\u2019s also okay with porn because it\u2019s anonymous, strippers and onlyfans are more personal and crosses a boundary, which again I agree with.

But at the time he was stationed in a different state due to the military and he flew in on the 4 day weekend for the wedding. And my MOH was driving like 8 hours from a different state to be there.\n\n Also for those saying you're too young- We got married a month before I turned 18 and he was 18. We had been together for a couple years already and he had recently gone through basic training for the Air Force and was about to be moved 2500 miles across the country for his first duty station. Would getting married like that work for everybody? No, but we knew ourselves and knew it would work for us.

I would like to experience the strip club and we made a boundary, if either one of us is going to go to one, it\u2019ll be together (we are both bisexual too) just like how we go to clubs together. 1 would find it very disrespectful if my boyfriend went to a strip club with his friends, and I expressed this to him when one of his friends tried bringing him to one (I knew about it days before the friend had planned to go) when I expressed my feelings, my boyfriend told that friend, and that friend ignored my boyfriend for weeks after because we wasn\u2019t going to the strip club (me and the friend also don\u2019t get along, it\u2019s been like that since 6th grade because of bullying and insults to me) in my opinion, you and your fianc\u00e9 should have a talk about if this friend is going to be a good influence or a bad on towards your marriage and your fianc\u00e9. It sounds like he is going to be a bad influence. Bad influence friends can and will do things that will negatively effect your relationship (my bfs \u201cfriend\u201d is a bad influence who negatively effects our relationship when they do speak to each other, rarely) your boundaries are not insane or bad, they are understandable boundaries, and Tim needs to understand that or he needs to go.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to have boundaries.

What ever you and your fiance agree to is what matters. Tim needs to realize that you are now the most important person in your fiance\u2019s life and therefore your feelings matter more than his in this situation.

He is showing no respect for his friend\u2019s relationship and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nWhen I got married 25 years ago there was a similar clash between my old friends and my wife about my bachelor party.

I\u2019m also a women who doesn\u2019t consider this cheating, but Tim is being awful. Does he even care what your fianc\u00e9 WANTS to do for his bachelor party?!\n\nLots of men have very tailored bachelor parties, and I think those are the best. Have you seen the episode of Parks and Rec where all the men have exactly the kind of bachelor party THEY would want? One has a board game party, another has a very snobby party with bizarrely obscure alcohol, one goes to an ice cream parlor, and another wants a steakhouse. I personally know a man who just had a cigar party because his bride hated cigars and it was his chance to indulge with his buddies without her having to smell it.\n\nHe needs a bachelor party that took more than two seconds to think up.

Worse sometimes as the girls are drunk af and many want to put on a show will have sex with other on the big boats they use their boobs to get on. The only thing I haven't seen at Lake Havasu is a man and woman having sex. I've seen plenty of lap dances. Never saw a guy get off during one. I've had lap dances from men and women, never got off. I've been to Chippendales and US MALE review, no one got off. I'm sorry so many women have been with men with so little self control they get off on themselves because a woman is doing her job.

I also don't really understand why going to a strip club is a bachelor party thing, especially when the bachelor, at least to the knowledge of the person planning, has never gone to a stripclub either while in a relationship or ever.", "NTA. If you and your fianc\u00e9 agree on a boundary, it\u2019s not up to a third party to decide that it\u2019s not okay. Glad to see the update that your fianc\u00e9 had your back with Tim.\n\nAlso sounds like your fianc\u00e9 had already expressed the boundary to Tim. Tim is not his friend. Tim wants to do what Tim wants to do. My husband doesn\u2019t care for strip clubs and told his friends he didn\u2019t want to go to one for his bachelor party. He\u2019d gone to them for other people\u2019s before and after, but for his, he was clear it wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Some of them were disappointed but they respected it, and no one blamed it on me.", "NTA OP, coming in late to say as a polyamorous person who\u2019s fianc\u00e9 regularly sleeps with one of our best friends, you handled this very well. Your boundary of stripclubs being cheating is valid, and you were in no way being controlling by enforcing a boundary both of you have agreed on.", "NTA.  This is a boundary you have both agreed on, and I am guessing your fiance would have felt incredibly uncomfortable at his own bachelor party.  It\u2019s not Tim's place to impose his beliefs or feelings about what your fiance should or shouldn't experience.  Ergo, Tim was the AH.", "While I think your attitude is over the top. If that's your boundary and your partner has agreed to it, then you're not an AH for bringing it up if anything if you didn't and he found out you didn't give him a heads up he might think you're an AH for not warning him, as let's face it there will be a fair chance they'll get him drunk and just drag him along if he's drunk enough he might not even remember what happens.\n\nI remember the first hour of my stag do, then maybe another hour dotted over the next 5. I gave my friends explicit instructions what I didn't want to happen and other than dressing me up as a lion and getting some random woman in a biker bar to use her make up to make me look like a big cat they just had a laugh at me crawling around on all fours and pouncing on them. Strip clubs aren't a must have for stag parties in fact I didn't want to go to one as I said the first time I went I want to go sober so I know what the fuss was about.\n\nYou would not be the AH", "Tbh I find this impossible to judge. You're very clear about your feeling that strip clubs are cheating (which I personally disagree with, but think can be a perfectly healthy and acceptable boundary in a relationship). What I feel like you DIDN'T share enough about is whether your boyfriend expressed any desire/curiosity to experience this (again/for this occasion), whether you talked about the boundary, whether you explored what's behind it for you, ...\nIn the end this could be pretty much any judgment available... Depending on how you negotiated your boundaries. \nAnyway, good luck with your marriage!", "Funny story: when I got married NO ONE planned a bachelor party for my future hubbie - his best man is did absolutely nothing and even left the wedding before toast because he wanted to be home. (hey, his choice but why even agree to be the best man then )so I (call me a bitch if you must) called each of his groomsman and asked if they could at least do SOMETHING for him. Every one of them (3) said Yeah, but I don't want to go to a strip club.\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\nThey agreed on a BBQ at the house while I was not home.\nStrip clubs are NOT a requirement at bachelor parties.", "Well it\u2019s not cheating in my opinion to go to the strip club but clearly that\u2019s how you feel and the boundaries you have expressed and as long as your not a hypocrite and understand that means no male dancer of any sort for you too then it\u2019s fine. Im confused why so many think it is cheating to attend a strip club. If your not touching and simply watching then it\u2019s no different than me watching Yellowstone and drooling over rip.", ">My fianc\u00e9 is currently picking up takeout and I am talking to josh.\n\nINFO why isn't your husband talking to Josh? I would think that he should be the one to speak to Josh since the bachelor party is for him.", "NTA, but you do sound SUPER controlling.", "NTA. You and your husband have agreed on boundaries together, which is fine. Tim was trying to force your husband into trampling on those boundaries. I\u2019m glad you told your husband and he was on the same page with you.", "NTA\n\n>He messaged him, telling him that he won\u2019t attend in a stripclub *as he told him before*\n\nSo Tim had already told him, and fianc\u00e9 said no!", "NTA what does \"one last free night\" even mean?", "NTA. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s cheating and there may be some trust issues or something there, the bottom line is that your partner shouldn\u2019t do anything that you think is over a line or uncomfortable.", "ESH. There is no question in my mind that Tim is an AH. You are a bit more borderline. \n\nAt the end of the day you do sound controlling to me. It feels like your partner would have been perfectly able to handle the situation without you getting involved, you didn't really have to go out of your way to police this. Then again if I 100% take you at your word and you just sort of randomly found out and then you were outraged, that's not the worst thing in the world.\n\nHaving boundaries is of course completely fine, but constantly policing them is going too far in my opinion. Nothing in your OP makes me feel like anything wrong would have happened if you didn't control the situation.", "I don't consider it cheating. I do know that my now-husband would find it *unbearably* awkward, and pressuring somebody to see naked ladies when they don't want to? Is sexual harassment. Damn straight I'd have told my fianc\u00e9, and he'd have thanked me for it.", "You were spot on!", "They talked about it though?", "He uninvited him because Tim called me q controlling b\u2018tch. That was not my decision.", "He said \u201eI\u2019ll look who can plan this or if I\u2019ll plan it myself.\u201c and went to get the takeout. \nI talked to josh (who is in a group chat with the other friends (so he could text them, I don\u2019t have all the numbers)) because knowing my fianc\u00e9 he would have trouble deciding whom to chose and forget to do it. So I talked to his best friend who informed all the other guys. So no matter who he asks (if he doesn\u2019t forget it) they are all on board and he will get a party even if he forgets it.", "Sorry if it read unclear. My fianc\u00e9 told Tim before that strip clubs were off limits. But this was month aho", "I was wondering why you are so rude, now I see you barely read the stories and are just rude to people\r  \nclearly a kid wanting to feel good about judging others\r  \nimprove little child", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

His bachelor party was local bar, pool, and game night. Mine was brunch with friends. He's flat out said that he did strip clubs when he was younger (as have I), and now that we're mid-30s, it's weird because we have close family members who are the same age as most girls in clubs.", "They don\u2019t and honestly as a dancer, uncomfortable/guilty bachelors who were reluctantly dragged there by their friends are awful customers so good looking out sis", "My only real concern was the fact that she stepped into the situation.  To me, that's the groom's action to take.", "LOL", "That sounds like a more fun night actually!", "I never even said a hard no to a strip club for my husband, but my husband took it upon himself to make it very clear he had no interest in strip clubs for his bachelor party. We started dating VERY young and have only ever been with each other and he told me he had no desire to do something that he feels is sexist and demeaning on a fun night out. Needless to say, his best man didn\u2019t plan that and they went bar hopping at some local bars instead and had a bonfire later. Good for men that don\u2019t cave to the strip club pressure", "I would have thought that going alone turns it into something even more depressing and sad.", "Oh of course, I just got so sick of people criticizing her for having a clear set, agreed upon boundary and calling her controlling and delusional for thinking it's cheating.", "I\u2019m bisexual and have mostly jokingly proposed the idea to my boyfriend. He was horrified at how awkward and weird it would be. Some people are just very private about sexual things and that\u2019s ok, and I think we exclude men from the \u201csome people\u201d too often", "i've never been to one at 32 and don't really want to go to one", "watching porn is definitely viewing someone other than your partner for sexual pleasure, as is going to a strip club. everyone can set their own boundaries for their relationship but it\u2019s a little silly to act like those are nothing in common.", "We know Tim planned the original, which was cancelled.\n\nTo refer to your previous comment, you wrote: \"Josh & I found a steak restaurant\" - This indicates that you & Josh found the restaurant together, thereby did some researching, which falls under 'planning' - so I assumed you were helping to plan the new bachelor party. \nYou booking stuff also falls into planning... so yes, you're helping to organise your fianc\u00e9's bachelor party.  \n\nIsolation can happen in many ways. In this instance, you may be isolating him (in the long run) by making things difficult with his friends. It's Tim now. Who else will you disagree with  & make things difficult? Your fiance will always have to side with you & may end up resenting you for it... I'm not saying you're wrong in this instance, but you might have to be more tolerant in future.", "Why do you consider porn anonymous and not only fans? They're both internet based (at least porn mostly is these days). Both often use fake names, and there are fake scenarios, etc. OnlyFans doesn't even necessarily involve full nudity. I'm not blaming or shaming, I'm honestly curious about this. I completely understand you seeing stripping as different.", "Thank you for making me chuckle at this! Your husband sounds adorable.", "While it's funny in hindsight, it definitely wasn't for your poor husband. However, I'd definitely be the drunk idiot not realizing how upset he was and wind him up too much. Is he still friends with them?", "Ewwww...", "Nobody said they're \"nothing in common\" but that they're not equivalent.\n\nYou can't tell me a person stripping *in front of you* and stripping on a phone screen is somehow equivalent lmao", "Josh isn't in town. Josh doesn't know which restaurant was. Josh has asked for help because the organizer was a dumbass that just wanted to see women get naked in front of him disregarding his friend's boundaries and his relationship and he isn't anymore in the bachelor party nor the wedding because he was highly disrespectful. That isn't isolating.", "While I agree that booking something for someone not in the country can be considered planning I don\u2019t agree that I am isolating him. I expressed a boundarie. I don\u2019t have to let people cross my boundaries. That has nothing to do with isolating.", "My dad always said strip clubs were pointless, because, \"there's no point in looking if I can't touch!\"", "straight up. this girl I was friends with for a long time kept quitting jobs to go back to it because she loved it. it was boyfriends making her stop but she told me she'd do it until she physically couldn't anymore if she could"]}
