So another good friend (Tim) of my fianc\u00e9 organised the bachelor party. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is at work right know and Tim came to pick something up. So I opened the door and we chatted for a bit. He then said something along the lines of \u201cMake sure your man packs enough dollar bills\u201d and jokingly replied \u201cfor the stripclub?\u201d He looked me dead in the eye and said: \u201cObviously.\u201d\n\nI asked twice and he repeatedly told me that he was serious he booked time in a stripclub for the bachelor party. \n\nFor me going into a strip club is cheating(I know everybody has their own opinion and mine is this. My fianc\u00e9 knows about that and would never plan something like that). \n\nSo I politely asked Tim to cancel whatever reservation this is, as we agreed to not do that and as I told him multiple times I consider it cheating. \n\nHe told me that he wouldn\u2019t change it and that my fianc\u00e9 deserved one last free night. \nI told him he could either cancel right know or I would tell my fianc\u00e9 about the plans and asking him to miss out on it (and I know he would because he would never want to cheat on me, as I would never cheat on him). \n\nTim said I was a control freak and had no right to decide this and that I would be a mayor AH if I ruined the surprise for my fianc\u00e9. \n\nWell I think I am in the right and I will tell my fianc\u00e9 about it, when he gets home. \n\nBut am I really the AH for doing so?\n\nEdit: First of all: Thank you to allconstructive and polite people sharing their opinions and judgments. \nNow two things: \n1. I did not ask if you think I am to young to get married or if you feel I am insecure or if you think it\u2019s cheating or if I am delusional for seeing it as cheating. I simply asked if I am the AH for telling my fianc\u00e9, nothing more. I also don\u2019t appreciate being insulted over private chat messages either. Please stop it. \n\n2. My fianc\u00e9 came home, I told him what happened and he asked if I was joking about the stripclub being part of the party plan. I repeated Tim\u2019s words to my fianc\u00e9. He messaged him, telling him that he won\u2019t attend in a stripclub as he told him before. They fought for about ten minutes on the phone and from what I got Tim caved and said he would cancel the strip club but called me a controlling b\u2019tch. This is when my fianc\u00e9 lost his shit and uninvited Tim from bachelor party and wedding. \n\nWell so there will be no strippers and I will call his best friend josh and will see if their still can be a bachelor party even without Tim. My fianc\u00e9 is currently picking up takeout and I am talking to josh.\n\nEdit 2: We ate a nice takeout (garlic naan and curry) and I made a plan with josh. Turns out he always planned to come a bit early to surprise my fianc\u00e9 at his bachelor party but didn\u2019t knew what Tim planned. Hebekunst knew when it would be. We talked about some nice ideas and josh will think about them and put them in order and message me so I can book the things.

If you are going to marry this man you'll need to be able to communicate things that make you uncomfortable. There are two ways this could play out. 1. You pretend to be cool with it, he goes, and you're resentful. Or 2. You respectfully ask for a reconsideration of plans and share your discomfort.

And if this is a boundary that you have agreed upon, and that works for both of you, then it is not Tim's place to run roughshod over it, or even to opine on it. He can have his own relationships and make decisions within them about how to behave . . . he does not get to do that for yours. And he certainly doesn't get to IMPOSE his decisions on your fianc\u00e9 as a \"surprise\" after being explicitly and clearly told that this is something that you both agree on. \n\nYou're not ruining anything by letting your fianc\u00e9 know what Tim is planning; you're keeping Tim from ruining everything with his nonsense.\n\nFWIW, it also speaks volumes that Tim's entire attitude towards marriage is that a groom-to-be \"\\[deserves\\] one last free night\" as though he thinks marriage is some sort of prison sentence for your husband instead of an active and joyful decision that HE IS CHOOSING TO MAKE to spend his life with the woman he loves.

Cheating she says..", "YTA- if you wanted to dictate what happens for his bachelor party, then why didn't you just set it all up? Your husband is a grown man and if he sees any issues with his friends plans, he will let them know. \n\nStrip clubs are for looking at women. Your husband doesn't even have to touch one or have one on him. The fact that you think it's cheating for him screams insecurity and lack of trust. Is it cheating for him to see nudity.on TV or the internet? What about thong bikinis on the beach? \n\nSurely you're the type of person who goes through his phone and has all his passwords.

I see a common theme in reddit responses where partners don't own their partner and saying you \"won't ALLOW them\" to do things makes you sound like their owner, which is sort of does. NOW, I'll say the same thing to you as I said to a guy this morning. While yes, people have the right to do what they want, and he can go to the club if he wants, he also has to know that not everyone is okay with that and to live with the consequences. Sure, he can live his life how he wants to, but he also can't force you to be okay with it. If you aren't okay with it, and you tell him that, which you have, and he clearly goes out and violates that, he can't be surprised if you peace out and go find someone who matches up with your values. But to not ALLOW him things, just makes you sound like his mommy and it's controlling.", "Lol you seem exhausting and like you don't trust your fiance.

First off OP if you\u2019re marring a man you can\u2019t trust then why are you marrying him?? I think his friend might be just trying to get a ride out of you and if it truly is the case where he is planning to go to the strip club. I would like to believe you soon to be husband will do the right thing. Remind and coach not demand and ruin the night.

If it\u2019s cheating after the paper, it\u2019s cheating before.", "BINGO. This whole idea that a bachelor party is a man's last night of \"freedom\" is sexist and misogynist. Basically this is saying a marriage (and women) are traps. Instead, why can't bachelor and bachelorette parties be celebrations of a wonderful committed relationship.\n\nNTA, OP. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see if your fiance backs up his friend or you. It says something about him if this is the kind of guy he values enough to be his best man.", "After being on the receiving end of getting to hear the rage and tears from couples who ended their relationships over this stuff. To me, it seems it comes down to two things that intertwine. A test and jealousy.\n\nGuys like Tim are a 'misery loves company' bunch and are frustrated that now their friend is going to be doing 'adult' things like starting a family with someone they care about. So what easier way then to take them to a strip club, drug them legally (alcohol is classified as a drug, it's classified as a CNS depressant), whisper poison in the ear and if the groom takes the bait and winds up in a position, they can swoop in and say things like 'maybe you don't really love her' etc and still get to keep the groom as a friend. If the groom doesn't take the bait, then guys like Tim will just become that one friend that always has to make a comment about the 'ball and chain'.\n\nOverall, I don't think this would be a serious case of what went down in a past post where the groomsmen set the groom up to be assaulted. Hopefully OP is able to talk to her fiance about this because if this is a boundary both of them set up and Tim is full willing to nuke it, Tim isn't a 'good friend' at all.", "Strippers at a bachelor party has been a stereotype for as long as I can remember.

If I was single then I might be able to appreciate it, but especially for a bachelor party I\u2019d feel so guilty and I\u2019d constantly be thinking about my fianc\u00e9.

Mine is different than hers. The chances of their marriage lasting are about half and being they are so young, that is a higher risk of divorce so he can go to strip clubs later on~maybe after his brain has fully developed. If they are in the US she's not old enough to into a strip club herself in many states. I honestly don't care but I'm thinking, beginning a marriage with these kind of demands, YOU CAN NOT GO TO A STRIP CLUB because that age old tradition is wrong in MY opinion while the age old tradition of wedding vows and marriage is RIGHT.

What she is saying is that she believes *paying* someone for sexual gratification is cheating, and I agree with her. There is a huge difference between **seeing** a woman in a bikini or topless on the beach and **paying** someone to show their tits to you. Plus, this is his bachelor party, he will get a lap dance from a stripper and possibly more, that\u2019s not just \u201clooking at boobs\u201d. She\u2019s also okay with porn because it\u2019s anonymous, strippers and onlyfans are more personal and crosses a boundary, which again I agree with.

Planning any kind of party for a specific person and choosing an activity they do not want to do makes you an awful party planner and in this case, a bad friend.

You're not single, don't act like it.)", "NTA no one gets to decide the boundaries in your relationship except you and your fianc\u00e9.

My now husband and I had the same agreement and neither of us even did a bachelor or bachelorette party, we think the concept of them is dumb. If it had been possible, we would have done a joint co-ed bridal party weekend getaway with a bunch of fun activities for everyone to do together. But at the time he was stationed in a different state due to the military and he flew in on the 4 day weekend for the wedding. And my MOH was driving like 8 hours from a different state to be there.\n\n Also for those saying you're too young- We got married a month before I turned 18 and he was 18. We had been together for a couple years already and he had recently gone through basic training for the Air Force and was about to be moved 2500 miles across the country for his first duty station. Would getting married like that work for everybody? No, but we knew ourselves and knew it would work for us. Now this year I'll be turning 26- we have three beautiful children, own our home and we each have our own car. I'd say it turned okay for us", "NTA. You are absolutely right.", "Yes I'm a sexworker, doesn't mean i can't differentiate the difference between jealously and actually cheating.

I have the same boundary set, not that I think it\u2019s cheating, but that I think it\u2019s disrespectful. I think it\u2019s disrespectful if my bf went out of his way to see almost naked dancers by himself or with his friends. I would not have a problem if we went together. I would like to experience the strip club and we made a boundary, if either one of us is going to go to one, it\u2019ll be together (we are both bisexual too) just like how we go to clubs together. 1 would find it very disrespectful if my boyfriend went to a strip club with his friends, and I expressed this to him when one of his friends tried bringing him to one (I knew about it days before the friend had planned to go) when I expressed my feelings, my boyfriend told that friend, and that friend ignored my boyfriend for weeks after because we wasn\u2019t going to the strip club (me and the friend also don\u2019t get along, it\u2019s been like that since 6th grade because of bullying and insults to me) in my opinion, you and your fianc\u00e9 should have a talk about if this friend is going to be a good influence or a bad on towards your marriage and your fianc\u00e9. It sounds like he is going to be a bad influence. Bad influence friends can and will do things that will negatively effect your relationship (my bfs \u201cfriend\u201d is a bad influence who negatively effects our relationship when they do speak to each other, rarely) your boundaries are not insane or bad, they are understandable boundaries, and Tim needs to understand that or he needs to go.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to have boundaries. Your partner understands and respects them. You both are on the same page which is great!\n\nTim is a major asshole. If he wants to go to a strip club so bad, why doesn\u2019t he just go?

What ever you and your fiance agree to is what matters. Tim needs to realize that you are now the most important person in your fiance\u2019s life and therefore your feelings matter more than his in this situation. If anyone is being a \u2018controlling bitch\u2019 it\u2019s Tim. He is showing no respect for his friend\u2019s relationship and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nWhen I got married 25 years ago there was a similar clash between my old friends and my wife about my bachelor party. While ultimately there were no strippers at mine I wish I had handled things as well as your fiance did. He did the right thing. That\u2019s a good sign.", "NTA.

I\u2019m also a women who doesn\u2019t consider this cheating, but Tim is being awful. Does he even care what your fianc\u00e9 WANTS to do for his bachelor party?!\n\nLots of men have very tailored bachelor parties, and I think those are the best. Have you seen the episode of Parks and Rec where all the men have exactly the kind of bachelor party THEY would want? One has a board game party, another has a very snobby party with bizarrely obscure alcohol, one goes to an ice cream parlor, and another wants a steakhouse. I personally know a man who just had a cigar party because his bride hated cigars and it was his chance to indulge with his buddies without her having to smell it.\n\nHe needs a bachelor party that took more than two seconds to think up. He deserves something personal.", "NTA. Cheating is whatever boundaries you guys set. Strip clubs is that boundary, it should be respected.

Boundaries can be controlling, but this one isn't!", "NTA, but what I really came here to say was that the update made me feel really happy.

Some guys think it is pitiful to go to strip clubs by themselves.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you went behind your fiance's back to find out where they were going, it was disclosed to you.  The 'one last night of freedom' thing is so ridiculous and puerile but not surprising certain people feel they have to do that for their bro before sending him off to the old ball and chain.  Tim's an asshole and was probably going to get way more enjoyment out of it than your fiance.  I've had strong sentiments towards close friends' partners before but I would NEVER call them an insulting name in front of my friend unless it was something obvious like I saw them cheating on my friend.", "NTA since you already made your fiancee aware of your feelings towards this.

Sorry that happened, that\u2019s my worst nightmare.", "My friends and I went to a Canadian strip club when we were in college a millennia ago. Guys were all nude. We weren\u2019t drunk or high enough to get over the ick factor. One guy kept coming up to our table and bouncing his junk in our faces and we had to leave.", "They still feel you up lmao it\u2019s a lap dance", "Well, it was quite a leading questioning, no? Her other boundaries are not relevant here.", "It\u2019s not about being \u201ccool\u201d it\u2019s about being realistic with expectations. Ultimatums never work well", "Yes, if answering the OP directly,  but there is no reason nor rule-breaking if any person wants to give an opinion on someone's marriage, boundaries, or anything else when someone decides to put their information out in a public forum. It is two different discussions.  \n\nFor example,  I absolutely think OP is NTA. She had every right to talk to her fiance about the party and discuss her discomfort and outline her boundaries.  Period. \n\nAt the same time,  having the benefit of many years of marriage and life experience,  I realize that what would have felt like a huge deal at 20 (strip club) doesn't mean a thing when compared to the *real* life-altering compromises people must make at times in a successful and happy marriage. There are times where you absolutely must put your partner's needs before your own and sometimes their needs are more important than your boundaries. There will be times in a good marriage when your partner will do that for you. A strip club is so insignificant in the bigger scheme of things and certainly people are entitled to express their opinions on it", "This is true, however, the commenter wasn't responding to you. If responding to you, I wouldn't discuss what I think your marriage will or won't survive, nor would I discuss your boundaries.  I would simply say, you are NTA - which is my opinion. \n\nHowever,  when discussing the situation with *other* redditors in the responses, I have absolutely shared my opinions on marriage in general and what I personally believe. That is absolutely allowable and appropriate,  whether you agree or disagree with the assessments people give.", "Thanks for the education.  I actually worked in strip clubs for a number of years. I know the game. And I'm not saying it's for everyone, and I don't have any issue with people who think it's cheating. I just happen to not agree.", "Just your opinion.  Many people would disagree.", "So would it be cheating if the husband got with a random woman and she feels him up and down? It\u2019s the same exact thing just ones inside a legal storefront and ones not. Getting a lap dance with any other person then your SO is definitely cheating", "I don't know where he's going to a strip club that he can reach satisfaction. In the Vegas strip clubs I've been to if you touch the girls the bouncers will throw your ass out. You've never been to Havasu at Spring Break if you don't think it's like a strip club. Worse sometimes as the girls are drunk af and many want to put on a show will have sex with other on the big boats they use their boobs to get on. The only thing I haven't seen at Lake Havasu is a man and woman having sex. I've seen plenty of lap dances. Never saw a guy get off during one. I've had lap dances from men and women, never got off. I've been to Chippendales and US MALE review, no one got off. I'm sorry so many women have been with men with so little self control they get off on themselves because a woman is doing her job.  OF is overrated. If a man is going on OF he's looking for a sexual AND personal connection.", "Friend, you're not going to change my mind, and I'm not trying to change yours. Have a wonderful day."]}
