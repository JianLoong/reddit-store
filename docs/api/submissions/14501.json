During a quiet moment one of my bridesmaids took me aside and told me that about three months ago she was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Obviously I asked her what that meant for her and she started crying because she feels differently about her relationship with her mother. We met in elementary school and she\u2019s always had a learning disability, but she didn\u2019t know that there was a preventable cause. My other bridesmaids noticed her crying, and the evening ended up being about her. We skipped out on going to a bar in the limo I had hired because she was upset. I thought about it all today and ended up emailing her to tell her that she took away an important moment from my life. I feel bad about this happening to her, but even though she didn\u2019t always know it\u2019s been going on for her whole life. If this was a recent thing she found out about or it was some kind of deadly disease I would feel differently, but she was sitting on this for months before bringing it up at an event that was supposed to be special to me. You only get one bachelorette and mine was totally overshadowed. I felt really hurt that she did that, and told her that I didn\u2019t want to have her in my wedding if that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to treat me at a time where the focus was supposed to be something good in my life instead of something sad in hers. She could have waited a few more weeks until after the wedding if she wanted to have this conversation. She\u2019s still invited to the wedding but I don\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid after this. I was just texting my cousin (my maid of honour) and she disagreed with me doing this. She said that it sucked that we didn\u2019t go to the bar, but this other friend has already paid for her dress so I should just let her stay. My fianc\u00e9 supports my choice, but I wanted another opinion.

I don't understand the y.t.a comments. She had 3 months to process her diagnosis and ask for support from friends. The thing that really angers me is that she turn a special moment that was supposed to be about having fun into something sad. And quite literally ruined your plans by using social pressure, because if you wanted to go to the bar anyway you would have looked like you don't care about her.\n\nI honestly wouldn't invite her to the wedding until she apologies, because this seems intentional.", "ESH - I get it! She found out months ago and waited until that night to say anything, took the attention, and you lost out on the money you paid. It was completely understandable to be hurt and frustrated. BUT you didn't need to cut her from the wedding. That was retaliation, pure and simple. You could have called her and opened up the door to have an honest conversation about how you felt and allow her to respond, this would've shown compassion and grace. Instead you made a decisive decision because your feelings were hurt. It is your wedding, but she is also a close enough friend where you asked her to be a bridesmaid and she deserved that conversation before you decided to push her out. I would absolutely apologize to her and realize that in this case you've both been shitty to each other.", "I have been in several situations where someone has had to turn another's happy occasion into all about themselves. NTA. Yes, you deserved to have your own moments. It is too bad that someone couldn't have escorted your friend home and stayed with her a bit to get her off of your case.", "NTA\n\nShe either knew what she was doing and intentionally undermined you\n\nOr she\u2019s incredibly self centered and had no idea she was making it all about her\n\nBut either way I wouldn\u2019t trust her to not pull similar at the wedding", "INFO: But it's info I think you should get from her. Was this the first time she was going to be around a bunch of alcohol since the diagnosis? If so, is that what triggered the disclosure at that moment? She may not have known how she'd feel about it, and it caught her by surprise.

You can't just shut off your feelings in a case like this, and having spontaneous hard feelings doesn't make her an AH.\n\nThat being said, there's a time and a place to bring sensitive personal information, and in the middle of a friend's celebration isn't it. Surely she knew what was planned for the night? If she wasn't comfortable going to a bar or partying with you, she should've discussed this with you beforehand and opted to stay home or leave early. There was really no reason to bring this up in the middle of your bachelorette party, especially since it wasn't brand-new information. She had ample opportunity to discuss this with you literally *any other time*. So yeah, I get why you're upset, too.", "INFO \n\nWas she drunk and had a meltdown? That\u2019s the only way I can see this as being a honest accident on her part. Not okay, but I\u2019d get it.", "NTA. While I can sympathize with her, and understand her wanting to talk about it, this was definitely not the time or place for it. \n\nShe hijacked your bachelorette party, and made it all about her. \nI wouldn\u2019t trust her, not to do the same thing, during your wedding.  While some people may feel your an AH for doing it, I believe it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry in this situation. \n\nCongratulations, and I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a wonderful wedding.", "NTA", "I have no ruling but I just want to throw it out there, that FAS affects the frontal lobe which means she probably doesn\u2019t have strong cognitive function.

People saying your the AH fail to grasp the day was about you. \nIf being around alcohol was a trigger for her, it would have been better for her to have this conversation with you before. Why this night?! She\u2019s known for two months, out of all the nights she picked this one. I\u2019m sorry but no, it was wrong of her. Time and place for everything, if I knew I was going to be triggered by something and ruin someone\u2019s night I would stay my ass home!", "NTA.  This was not the time or place for her to do this.

A few more days of waiting would be enough to not ruin your party & wedding.\n\nIf she was your friend, and emotional, she could have excused herself for the night instead of spoiling everybody\u2019s mood on a day that was supposed to be a celebration. Your plans and your money went down the drain. \n\nAll those Y-T-A and E-S-H people would say otherwise if their big day was the one ruined by a pick me girl.\n\nThe so-called friend is the one who should apologize and maybe even reimburse OP\u2019s money that was wasted, as memories of a happy bachelorette party are forever gone.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nShe knew what she was doing that night since she\u2019s known her diagnosis for months. Maybe the bar scene was upsetting, who knows. But she could have redirected the conversation at some point, could have still used the limo, or merely said - thanks for listening. Let\u2019s go dancing now!\n\n(And I say this as someone who didn\u2019t really do a bachelorette party so it\u2019s like I\u2019m heavily invested in the experience or something.)\n\nBut you also suck here. \n\nThrowing her out of the wedding party seems extreme, at least at this point. Why not say that what happened at your bachelorette party hurt your feelings and why. Then tell her you don\u2019t want a repeat scene at the wedding. Ask if she believes that will be an issue. You get the idea. If she apologized it would have been fine. But you never gave her the chance to make amends.", "NTA that was not the place or time for her to do that, maybe she was overwhelmed but anyway, she was wrong, and you can do wherever you want with your wedding.", "these responses are all absolutely insane. unless this is part of a much larger pattern of attention seeking on this her part, you absolutely suck as a friend. bachelorettes happen every day (I should know, I work on a booze cruise - yours is not special). you can always have other parties later. this is a traumatic diagnosis for your friend and you responded in the 100% least supportive way possible. jesus. \n\neta: yta.", "NTA. This is something she has dealt with her whole life, and had diagnosed 3 whole months before your bachelorette. She choose to bring this up at an event that was supposed to honor *you*. She should have excused herself and left. Also, if it was that devastating why didn't she tell you any other day in the last 3 months?", "NTA - She knew for three months and could\u2019ve mentioned it at any point then. Yet she chose to bring it up during your bachelorette party. She wanted the attention.", "You were a little harsh but she did completely take away your bachelorette.  In my opinion she should have backed out of going to that and told you the reason after and privately.  Kinda ESH/NAH line.", "You lack generosity of spirit and you will discover the day after your wedding that there's more to life than it. Or maybe you haven't thought that far ahead. Husbands come and go but friends are a non-replenishing resource in life.", "YTA. I get that you were disappointed, but your friend had a crisis. Someone who thought she could get support in a difficult moment from someone who she thought was a good and trusted friend. She likely didn't sit on the info waiting to use it to ruin your life, but spent that time struggling and for whatever reason that night it all got overwhelming and she reached out for help. Being diagnosed with a lifelong issue that her own mother caused is a huge emotional burden.   \n\n\nYou can have another bachelorette do, you can even do one after the wedding as a do-over. There's no requirement for having one. But this whole \"my special day\" thing with weddings is vastly overblown.

Be less self-centered.", "ESH.\n\nShe should've picked a better time to tell you before the bachelorette party. \n\nYou should've been more supportive and not so self centered about it.", "I guess it depends if one day is worth losing your friendship over", "Nta", "If you could drop her out of your wedding line over one night (yes, a memorable event, but still only one night of your life), then why was she in your wedding line in the first place?

She shouldn't have ruined the party for sure, and you basically responded to her emotional plea for support with \"but what about my party tho.\"", "NTA. As you mentioned, if this news was very fresh and new to your friend (within the last month, give or take), you should\u2019ve showed more sympathy and support. However she\u2019d known this for three months. That\u2019s a good amount of time to process her diagnosis. Maybe she was not able, but then she should\u2019ve just told you and stepped back from her role. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do if I were in your friend\u2019s shoes.", "NTA", "ESH, though she shouldn't have made a scene she was probably surrounded by alcohol which was most likely very triggering to her. \n\nYou acted out of anger and immediately kicked her out of the bridal party. This should have been a conversation later. \n\nI get it. In your mind, she had 3 months and should have told you already. In her mind, she might have thought she could have made it through both the Bach party and the wedding. Hence, why are you both in the wrong here.", "ESH. Your feelings are valid. I would have felt the same way too. However your wedding is 3 weeks away and you didn\u2019t even try to have a conversation with her. You\u2019ve known each other most of your lives. I feel like your friendship deserved a conversation.", "I was on your side up until you kicked her out of your wedding with weeks to go.

You were all chuffed to have a night out with the girls.  \n\nYep, your friend could have shared the FAS diagnosis earlier, so what?  You felt she \"stole\" or \"ruined\" YOUR special event.  Her entire life is affected.....\n\nYep, it was an AH move of your friend to raise that topic at that particular juncture in time.  How about you take another approach to the situation, like: \"Hey... That really sucks.   Let's take a bit to talk about it.   This is a safe place with friends.\"\n\nThen talk it through.\n\nIf she can't or won't, calm down, then she can be allowed the option of leaving the event - WITHOUT SHAME OR RECRIMINATIONS - and everyone goes and has a good time.  \n\nIf she's doing this to have attention focussed on her, then she'll leave.\n\nIf, after talking about it, she works through her feelings in the matter, you guys can all go out and have a great time.   You can remember it as the evening where you all became closer because you could both celebrate a friend's new future and comfort a friend who found out her Mom was a jerk.\n\nWin-win.\n\nKicking her out of the bridal party is a jerk move and yeah, that would make you TA.", "ESH.

FAS can be completely debilitating to a person. A guy who lived in the basement of a house I rented had FAS and he couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t really build functional relationships, and could barely take care of himself. I moved out after I found DOZENS of my and various female roommates underwear that he\u2019d been stealing from the laundry (I had been travelling a lot, and it was over like a year. You never expect someone is stealing your underwear). I moved out bc I was uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t BLAME him. He has a disability. Now I\u2019m not saying the friend here is this level of disabled, but FAS has super real implications for people and how they\u2019re able to live their lives. \n\nOP, I totally get that you\u2019re disappointed.

Yes, she messed up but maybe having a discussion about how she hurt you might be better. ESH", "YTA for kicking her out over this. Complete bridezilla behavior. \n\nI'm willing to bet something about the drinking triggered her. Also women get drunk and cry, it happens. This is not the most important night of your life, it's just getting together with your friends and drinking and having fun. Guessing you've done that before quite a bit. It's self-centered to consider this sUcH aN iMpOrTanT eVenT. And plenty of people get more than one bachelorette party in their lives.", "Bridezilla!! Couldn't you just have dried her tears, and proceeded with your plans for the Bachelorette? If she didn't feel she could participate,  you should've sent her home in an Uber, same as you'd do for someone with a migraine, and check up with her in the morning. Your bridesmaids are not robots, they might have an emotion or two. Your role is to lead the way with compassion and sympathy, rolling with the upsets and sticking to your master plan. Sounds like you overreacted, and kicked this chick out completely, where a short talk about your expectations might've smoothed things more nicely.", "Your friend sat on it for 3 months, but maybe she only recently had an interaction with her mother which was significant and overly-emotional.\n\nCutting her off does nothing to improve the situation.\n\nIt's unfortunate that her story brought negativity to the festivities, but aren't true friendships about supporting one another in both good times and not-so-good times, even when timing coincides?\n\nClearly that friendship didn't mean that much to you.\n\nHopefully, no one suffers a heart attack or other severe medical episode on your wedding day, rudely taking the spotlight away from you.\n\nYTA.", "I have a feeling with that attitude you will get a second shot at a bachelorette party..

If she had such an issue with alcohol she could\u2019ve excused herself from YOUR weekend or that one specific night in particular. While she does deserve support, she lost a lot of sympathy by ruining your plans. Demoting her to guest us justified in this situation. Maybe at some point yall can be closer friends again, but I would definitely give each other space right now.", "NTA. She had MONTHS to tell you this and waited for a night when you were supposed to be happy and having fun. You also lost out on not only a memorable experience but money as well. I would be livid.", "NTA - the morning my bachelorette started, I got a call from a friend saying she was sick and wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. I was sorry she couldn\u2019t be there, but went on w the day and had a great time.\n\nI found out later that she and her husband were getting divorced, and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t come - because she knew she\u2019d make it about her and bring everyone down. And that\u2019s just not a nice thing to do, not when you can avoid it. She had other people with her at the time \u2014 if she\u2019d had no one else and needed me, that would be different.

There\u2019s so many expectations around it. Like is your bachelorette party really that important that you\u2019re going to uninvite one of your best friends??? I dunno. Weddings never go as planned and it\u2019s a lot more fun for everyone if people stop having weird expectations of perfection and instead just celebrate the moment with people you care about.\n\nAlso, a person with FAS is legitimately disabled in a way that affects behavior so maybe don\u2019t judge her so harshly?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nAnd I doubt this will be your only/last bachelorette party", "NTA this feels like an attention grab by your friend. It may not have been intentional but either way I think you did the right thing. Be prepared that she will spend your whole wedding moaning about not being a bridesmaid because you found out about her fetal alcohol syndrome. It might be good to have someone deputized to eject her if necessary. Yikes what was she thinking?", "Damn I think I\u2019m the AH because when I read that she found out 3 months earlier and decided to tell EVERYONE the night of the bachelorette I started laughing. (Obviously this is very serious and I feel for OPs friend but waiting 3 months then dropping this at the worst time got me) Overall I think this is a ESH for both of you. \n\nLook this is rough and I do think she sucks for making the night about her. Of course her feelings are valid and I feel for her, but there is a time and place for things and if she wasn\u2019t up for going out she could have stayed home. However, kicking her out of the party so close to the wedding is really not cool. Especially since it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re reimbursing her for what she has spent.  \n\nPersonally I think she should still be in your wedding party and you should sit down with her and tell her how you felt about what happened.  Your feelings matter too but you can still give her support, I don\u2019t think she meant to ruin the night so I wouldn\u2019t damage the friendship further over this.", "YTA\n\nYour friend was in distress. I'm sorry she ruined the night of your bachelorette party, but frankly that's really not a big deal night. \n\nHowever, instead of discussing how it made you feel and how you think it was inappropriate, you boot her from your wedding party for what reason? Punishment? Prevention? Deterrent? Any way you cut it, that was mean.", "YTA - you think that maybe going out AND DRINKING triggered her and she couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer? Sounds like she\u2019s been trying not to burden you this because it seems like you like to hog the spotlight and aren\u2019t supportive.  Aren\u2019t you supposed to be her friend? But she has an actual crisis and you throw her out of your bridal party? Yikes. Seriously, take a hard look at your relationships, do any of them have depth, or are these just party/Instagram friends?", "YTA. \n\nWhat your friend is experiencing is traumatic. It's forcing her to re-evaluate her identity and her relationship with her mother. You complain that she has known for 3 months and insinuate you believe that is a long time. In terms of trauma, it is still considered recent. So recent that she may still be dealing with shock. It's possible she hadn't told you because she's still processing and didn't know to tell you. Trauma eclipses rational thought and affects memory. \n\nDid it occur to you she, someone who was recently diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, was maybe triggered by alcohol? It's possible she was so flooded with emotions (and possible physical symptoms) that she felt she had no choice but to tell you. Before you claim she should have anticipated this, trauma responses can be unpredictable in general. They'd be even more unpredictable for your friend right now since the event just happened. Maybe she had been avoiding alcohol until now. \n\nRegardless of the particular details, your friend came to you vulnerable in search of support. You did the exact opposite and may have actually re traumatized her. Trauma is inherently isolating. It's likely she feels alone and like others can't relate. It can also make you feel deep shame, guilt and fear being seen as a burden to others. What you have done by exiling her from your bridal party is isolate her further and likely made her feel ashamed and like a burden for \"ruining\" your bach. Whether intentional or not you were cruel. If you care about your friend, apologize, make her your bridesmaid again and listen to her nonjudgmentally.", "ESH. I get the bridesmaid wanting to share this with her friends but this was not the moment. It might have felt super critical to her at the moment but it was selfish to take the whole party and bring it down. \n\nBut bride didn\u2019t need to cut her out as bridesmaid. That seems petty and unnecessary. If this is a good, lifelong friend, then cutting her out will have consequences. If bride is ok with that, ok. But it just seems like more some unfortunate bad timing to me.", "ESH. Idk how y\u2019all live like this. Whole post was chaos.", "NTA, but it\u2019s not just the one girl\u2019s fault for trauma-dumping - everyone else who stopped the party and mutually agreed to switch their focus to her and forgo the whole outing is also to blame. Good friends would have tried to calm her and encourage her to go home and talk it out tomorrow if she was inconsolable. I\u2019m sorry you had your night ruined", "INFO: Is there any chance she didn't say anything for 3 months because there was never a moment where it didn't feel like \"you can't have your own shit going on during OP's bridal year!\" or because you only ever talk to people about the wedding? \n\nWas her initial disclosure related to being asked to drink alcohol or comments about drinking? Do you actually believe her reaction was within her control? Was she having a trauma reaction? Beyond the clear and immediate emotional impact of her new diagnosis, does she, perhaps as part of her disability, have trouble either with emotional regulation or with social interactions?\n\nDid she ruin the party or did everyone overreact in a way that led to the party being ruined? \n\nI've had a somewhat similar situation at an important party where someone had a trauma reaction to something that was happening. It took less than 10 minutes of my time to take her aside, hug her, tell her it's ok and not her fault, listen to her and decide together if she should stay or go home with reassurance that I'm not mad. She left, party resumed just fine. I caught up with her the next day to discuss her problems in more detail. No friendship was damaged, no one was mad. At most, a few people asked me if she was ok.

During a quiet moment one of my bridesmaids took me aside and told me that about three months ago she was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Obviously I asked her what that meant for her and she started crying because she feels differently about her relationship with her mother. We met in elementary school and she\u2019s always had a learning disability, but she didn\u2019t know that there was a preventable cause. My other bridesmaids noticed her crying, and the evening ended up being about her. We skipped out on going to a bar in the limo I had hired because she was upset. I thought about it all today and ended up emailing her to tell her that she took away an important moment from my life. I feel bad about this happening to her, but even though she didn\u2019t always know it\u2019s been going on for her whole life. If this was a recent thing she found out about or it was some kind of deadly disease I would feel differently, but she was sitting on this for months before bringing it up at an event that was supposed to be special to me. You only get one bachelorette and mine was totally overshadowed. I felt really hurt that she did that, and told her that I didn\u2019t want to have her in my wedding if that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to treat me at a time where the focus was supposed to be something good in my life instead of something sad in hers. She could have waited a few more weeks until after the wedding if she wanted to have this conversation. She\u2019s still invited to the wedding but I don\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid after this. I was just texting my cousin (my maid of honour) and she disagreed with me doing this. She said that it sucked that we didn\u2019t go to the bar, but this other friend has already paid for her dress so I should just let her stay. My fianc\u00e9 supports my choice, but I wanted another opinion. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her choice to stay or go as she knew that was the plan all along. Now do you remove her?

Would be the best outcome for all of you.", "Just got back today from a birthday trip I planned for my BFs birthday and a couple of friends.

Shit happens in life, and it's how you respond which defines your character. Did her behavior take away from your spotlight, yes. However, she's your long time friend. Being upset is one thing, but kicking her out of being in your wedding is just cruel when your friend was reaching out for support. And your choice seems poorly thought out and impulsive, both hallmarks of immaturity. You have to make judgment calls in life and in relationships. You could have had a serious and heartfelt conversation with her after your party and told her how you felt and perhaps set some boundaries, at least giving her a chance to reflect and speak for herself or offer an apology. Maybe take some time to reflect on your values and friendships and what is important to you. Chances are one day you'll be in a similar situation where you need support or comfort...how would you want to be treated? I think this is sort of a learning experience for you. In 20 years I promise you won't care about your Bachelorette party at all. Bigger and better things happen and you grow up.", "NTA. She should have just shut up about her issues. The day was for you. She knew what she was doing. It makes sense to cut her out of the wedding now as a precaution than having regrets later.", "ESH - including the other bridesmaids. \n\nI was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis the day of my friends wedding rehearsal. The 4 of us (bride +3 bridesmaids including myself) have been best friends for over a decade and everyone knew about my appointment that day. I told one bridesmaid on the way to the rehearsal and we discussed how long I could reasonably wait to tell the other two about the official diagnosis. I had waited a couple of months before telling them all about the potential diagnosis, (just until I\u2019d met with my neurologist and received a probable diagnosis, pending an MRI to confirm) and my delay had not gone over well with them. So we decided that I could probably get away with waiting until just after the wedding, but that if anyone asked, that I needed to be fully upfront and honest and then put a pin in it to discuss later. The 3rd bridesmaid asked right at the end of the church portion. Luckily the bride and groom were still busy with the priest so didn\u2019t hear. 3rd bridesmaid made a shocked and very quick devastated expression then quickly moved on when I told her the diagnosis was confirmed and that we\u2019d talk about it later to not distract from the wedding. I honestly did not expect (hoped I guess) the bride to even remember that I\u2019d had my appointment until after the wedding\n\nThe bride did ask about my appointment later on that evening and I told her that I\u2019d been diagnosed, assured her that I was ok and that she could ask me more questions if she wanted, but that all the information would keep until next week. She nodded, we shared smiles of support for each other, and all went out for coffee the next week to discuss treatment, prognosis, next steps etc. The rest of the weekend we all just had fun celebrating the couple. We did talk about it off and on through the weekend when the 4 of were alone. Mostly just me answering any questions that were distracting them and then moved on to whatever was next on whoever\u2019s mind. If it looked like anyone was getting stuck on it, one of the bridesmaids would distract everyone with something else wedding related and it refocused everyone back onto the day. TBH this was easy as we told no one else so anytime anyone walked by or was in the room it wasn\u2019t talked about. \n\nAll the bridesmaids should be working together to make sure the focus stays on the bride\u2026 including the bride\u2019s own focus. It\u2019s normal for people\u2019s minds to wander when things are busy or stressful, but it\u2019s the bridesmaids main job to make sure events scheduled for the wedding stay on track.\n\nRemoval from the bridal party entirely depends on the friendship. No real harsh judgement on the bride. I think a discussion first would have been a better way to handle it, but she knows the friend and the friendship better than anyone else. \n\nThe friend pulling her aside on that night just to tell her, unprompted, about a 3 month old discovery was an asshole move. It could have waited until after the weekend. Her other bridesmaids should have refocused everyone\u2019s attention back onto the bachelorette party and the activities they had also likely spent a fair bit of time planning and coordinating. It never should have taken over the entire night or lead to the cancelling of anything. If I was any one of her bridesmaids I\u2019d be busting my ass to try to plan almost anything in the short time left until the wedding to make up my failure to her. Special dinner, spa day, something the bride loves doing and just doing that thing. Something she doesn\u2019t have to plan or pay for or use any of her energy to rearrange for. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a bride so don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be upset at the other bridesmaids, but no bride I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid for has been anywhere close to drama caused by someone else at their bridal events\u2026 Maybe I\u2019ve just been part of good bridesmaid teams, but I thought that was the main thing you were supposed to do?", "if people stop putting so much importance in their weddings/bachelor/bachelorettes parties, others will stop ruining them. you can ruin something that's already not a big deal", "ESH", "I really do not blame the bride for excluding her from the wedding because she might do it again and then the wedding would be about her.

You have every right to try to make this day as perfect as possible. Honestly, she may not be able to handle it...nothing wrong with that.  I say pay her for the dress and any other expenses she may have incurred as a bridesmaid.
