During a quiet moment one of my bridesmaids took me aside and told me that about three months ago she was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Obviously I asked her what that meant for her and she started crying because she feels differently about her relationship with her mother. We met in elementary school and she\u2019s always had a learning disability, but she didn\u2019t know that there was a preventable cause. My other bridesmaids noticed her crying, and the evening ended up being about her. We skipped out on going to a bar in the limo I had hired because she was upset. I thought about it all today and ended up emailing her to tell her that she took away an important moment from my life. I feel bad about this happening to her, but even though she didn\u2019t always know it\u2019s been going on for her whole life. If this was a recent thing she found out about or it was some kind of deadly disease I would feel differently, but she was sitting on this for months before bringing it up at an event that was supposed to be special to me. You only get one bachelorette and mine was totally overshadowed. I felt really hurt that she did that, and told her that I didn\u2019t want to have her in my wedding if that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to treat me at a time where the focus was supposed to be something good in my life instead of something sad in hers. She could have waited a few more weeks until after the wedding if she wanted to have this conversation. She\u2019s still invited to the wedding but I don\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid after this. I was just texting my cousin (my maid of honour) and she disagreed with me doing this. She said that it sucked that we didn\u2019t go to the bar, but this other friend has already paid for her dress so I should just let her stay. My fianc\u00e9 supports my choice, but I wanted another opinion. AITA?\n\nUpdate: for those wondering I had actually seen her on two occasions since her diagnosis, including getting coffee one on one a week after it happened where she could have told me. It was the fact that she waited until my event to tell me and then derailed it that had me so upset. I hadn\u2019t considered the fact that everyone pre drinking might have set her off. After reading a bunch of comments here I called her. I asked why she hadn\u2019t told me before and she said she was still trying to process when I had previously seen her. She didn\u2019t realize she was going to cry so much and distract everyone and ruin the mood. She said she felt really horrible about doing that and that she hadn\u2019t meant to ruin the evening. I apologized for acting on my own hurt feelings and asked if she\u2019d be willing to consider still being a bridesmaid. She said she really wanted to still be in the wedding. I don\u2019t have the budget to have another bachelorette party, but I realize that I was only making that loss worse by hurting an old friend in addition to losing out on an event. I was definitely attributing her behaviour to malice when it was actually bad timing. Back in high school she did a similar thing to me because she was jealous of the attention I was getting as part of a competitive choir, but she\u2019s grown up since then (we\u2019re 23 and 24 now). I overreacted, and I honestly appreciate the tough love from this sub. It made me reconsider what I was doing and probably just saved a friendship.", "created_utc": 1681172755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i24hk/aita_for_firing_my_bridesmaid_for_disclosing_her/", "score": 8416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't understand the y.t.a comments. She had 3 months to process her diagnosis and ask for support from friends. The thing that really angers me is that she turn a special moment that was supposed to be about having fun into something sad. And quite literally ruined your plans by using social pressure, because if you wanted to go to the bar anyway you would have looked like you don't care about her.\n\nI honestly wouldn't invite her to the wedding until she apologies, because this seems intentional.", "ESH - I get it! She found out months ago and waited until that night to say anything, took the attention, and you lost out on the money you paid. It was completely understandable to be hurt and frustrated. BUT you didn't need to cut her from the wedding. That was retaliation, pure and simple. You could have called her and opened up the door to have an honest conversation about how you felt and allow her to respond, this would've shown compassion and grace. Instead you made a decisive decision because your feelings were hurt. It is your wedding, but she is also a close enough friend where you asked her to be a bridesmaid and she deserved that conversation before you decided to push her out. I would absolutely apologize to her and realize that in this case you've both been shitty to each other.", "I have been in several situations where someone has had to turn another's happy occasion into all about themselves. NTA. Yes, you deserved to have your own moments. It is too bad that someone couldn't have escorted your friend home and stayed with her a bit to get her off of your case.", "NTA\n\nShe either knew what she was doing and intentionally undermined you\n\nOr she\u2019s incredibly self centered and had no idea she was making it all about her\n\nBut either way I wouldn\u2019t trust her to not pull similar at the wedding", "INFO: But it's info I think you should get from her. Was this the first time she was going to be around a bunch of alcohol since the diagnosis? If so, is that what triggered the disclosure at that moment? She may not have known how she'd feel about it, and it caught her by surprise. I think you kind of feel like this was intentional, but it might not have been", "NTA: She knew for three fucking months. She knew what the hell she was doing.", "NTA. There is a time and place for everything.", "INFO\n was there alcohol involved before her confession? was she drunk? or were there people drinking? \n\nin any of those situations i can see how she might suddenly burst after holding in a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome.", "Eh, I'm going to go against the grain and say NAH on this one.\n\nI 100% believe that your friend deserves love and support and understanding about her diagnosis--it seems to be weighing on her and she's struggling to process it. You can't just shut off your feelings in a case like this, and having spontaneous hard feelings doesn't make her an AH.\n\nThat being said, there's a time and a place to bring sensitive personal information, and in the middle of a friend's celebration isn't it. Surely she knew what was planned for the night? If she wasn't comfortable going to a bar or partying with you, she should've discussed this with you beforehand and opted to stay home or leave early. There was really no reason to bring this up in the middle of your bachelorette party, especially since it wasn't brand-new information. She had ample opportunity to discuss this with you literally *any other time*. So yeah, I get why you're upset, too.", "INFO \n\nWas she drunk and had a meltdown? That\u2019s the only way I can see this as being a honest accident on her part. Not okay, but I\u2019d get it.", "NTA. While I can sympathize with her, and understand her wanting to talk about it, this was definitely not the time or place for it. \n\nShe hijacked your bachelorette party, and made it all about her. \nI wouldn\u2019t trust her, not to do the same thing, during your wedding.  While some people may feel your an AH for doing it, I believe it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry in this situation. \n\nCongratulations, and I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a wonderful wedding.", "NTA", "I have no ruling but I just want to throw it out there, that FAS affects the frontal lobe which means she probably doesn\u2019t have strong cognitive function.

She may need some grace in that area", "NTA.\n\nBut this may have been the first time since her diagnosis that she was faced with the prospect of going to a bar and didn\u2019t realize how it would hit her emotionally. If she was waiting 3 months to tell you, it may have been exactly because she didn\u2019t want to overshadow your wedding. Hear her out at least.", "NTA She\u2019s going through a rough time but she shouldn\u2019t have spoilt your party.", "NTA. I would have subtly suggested she go home and then enjoy my night out.", "NTA there's a time and place, and a bachelorette party is rarely either", "NTA! \nIt was your bachelorette!! People saying your the AH fail to grasp the day was about you. \nIf being around alcohol was a trigger for her, it would have been better for her to have this conversation with you before. Why this night?! She\u2019s known for two months, out of all the nights she picked this one. I\u2019m sorry but no, it was wrong of her. Time and place for everything, if I knew I was going to be triggered by something and ruin someone\u2019s night I would stay my ass home!", "NTA.  This was not the time or place for her to do this.  I\u2019m sorry your bachelorette was ruined.", "It\u2019s sad what your friend is going through, but she waited 3 months. A few more days of waiting would be enough to not ruin your party & wedding.\n\nIf she was your friend, and emotional, she could have excused herself for the night instead of spoiling everybody\u2019s mood on a day that was supposed to be a celebration. Your plans and your money went down the drain. \n\nAll those Y-T-A and E-S-H people would say otherwise if their big day was ruined by a girl who steals attention and ruins the mood.\n\nIt's common sense: you don't crack jokes at funerals, you don't talk about stillbirth at baby showers, and you don't talk about your crippling health issues at other people's bachelorette parties.\n\nThe so-called friend is the one who should apologize and maybe even reimburse OP\u2019s money that was wasted, as memories of a happy bachelorette party are forever gone.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nShe knew what she was doing that night since she\u2019s known her diagnosis for months. Maybe the bar scene was upsetting, who knows. But she could have redirected the conversation at some point, could have still used the limo, or merely said - thanks for listening. Let\u2019s go dancing now!\n\n(And I say this as someone who didn\u2019t really do a bachelorette party so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m heavily invested in the experience or something.)\n\nBut you also suck here. \n\nThrowing her out of the wedding party seems extreme, at least at this point. Why not say that what happened at your bachelorette party hurt your feelings and why. Then tell her you don\u2019t want a repeat scene at the wedding. Ask if she believes that will be an issue. You get the idea. If she apologized it would have been fine. But you never gave her the chance to make amends.\n\nEdited: Typo", "NTA that was not the place or time for her to do that, maybe she was overwhelmed but anyway, she was wrong, and you can do wherever you want with your wedding.", "these responses are all absolutely insane. unless this is part of a much larger pattern of attention seeking on this her part, you absolutely suck as a friend. bachelorettes happen every day (I should know, I work on a booze cruise - yours is not special). you can always have other parties later. this is a traumatic diagnosis for your friend and you responded in the 100% least supportive way possible. jesus. \n\neta: yta.", "NTA. This is something she has dealt with her whole life, and had diagnosed 3 whole months before your bachelorette. She choose to bring this up at an event that was supposed to honor *you*. She should have excused herself and left. Also, if it was that devastating why didn't she tell you any other day in the last 3 months?", "NTA - She knew for three months and could\u2019ve mentioned it at any point then. Yet she chose to bring it up during your bachelorette party. She wanted the attention.", "You were a little harsh but she did completely take away your bachelorette.  In my opinion she should have backed out of going to that and told you the reason after and privately.  Kinda ESH/NAH line.", "You lack generosity of spirit and you will discover the day after your wedding that there's more to life than it. Or maybe you haven't thought that far ahead. Husbands come and go but friends are a non-replenishing resource in life.", "YTA. I get that you were disappointed, but your friend had a crisis. Someone who thought she could get support in a difficult moment from someone who she thought was a good and trusted friend. She likely didn't sit on the info waiting to use it to ruin your life, but spent that time struggling and for whatever reason that night it all got overwhelming and she reached out for help. Being diagnosed with a lifelong issue that her own mother caused is a huge emotional burden.   \n\n\nYou can have another bachelorette do, you can even do one after the wedding as a do-over. There's no requirement for having one. But this whole \"my special day\" thing with weddings is vastly overblown. The world, and the people you care about, don't stop having their own lives because you're getting married. Some empathy wouldn't hurt.", "YTA, yes. Be less self-centered.", "ESH.\n\nShe should've picked a better time to tell you before the bachelorette party. \n\nYou should've been more supportive and not so self centered about it.", "I guess it depends if one day is worth losing your friendship over", "Nta", "If you could drop her out of your wedding line over one night (yes, a memorable event, but still only one night of your life), then why was she in your wedding line in the first place? Did she do something selfish and out-of-line? Yes, absolutely, but  you're talking about someone that you were (presumably) close enough to before the bachelorette party to include in your wedding party; don't ruin an entire friendship because she ruined one night.", "ESH\n\nBoth of your timings for these discussions were awful. She shouldn't have ruined the party for sure, and you basically responded to her emotional plea for support with \"but what about my party tho.\"", "NTA. As you mentioned, if this news was very fresh and new to your friend (within the last month, give or take), you should\u2019ve showed more sympathy and support. However she\u2019d known this for three months. That\u2019s a good amount of time to process her diagnosis. Maybe she was not able, but then she should\u2019ve just told you and stepped back from her role. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do if I were in your friend\u2019s shoes.", "NTA", "ESH, though she shouldn't have made a scene she was probably surrounded by alcohol which was most likely very triggering to her. \n\nYou acted out of anger and immediately kicked her out of the bridal party. This should have been a conversation later. \n\nI get it. In your mind, she had 3 months and should have told you already. In her mind, she might have thought she could have made it through both the Bach party and the wedding. Hence, why are you both in the wrong here.", "ESH. Your feelings are valid. I would have felt the same way too. However your wedding is 3 weeks away and you didn\u2019t even try to have a conversation with her. You\u2019ve known each other most of your lives. I feel like your friendship deserved a conversation.", "I was on your side up until you kicked her out of your wedding with weeks to go.

Why oh WHY is there such an emphasis on \"MY\" wedding.   \"MY\" bachelorette.  \"MY PERFECT DAY\"? There is NO SUCH THING as perfect.

Her entire life is affected.....\n\nYep, it was an AH move of your friend to raise that topic at that particular juncture in time.  How about you take another approach to the situation, like: \"Hey... That really sucks.   Let's take a bit to talk about it.   This is a safe place with friends.\"\n\nThen talk it through.\n\nIf she can't or won't, calm down, then she can be allowed the option of leaving the event - WITHOUT SHAME OR RECRIMINATIONS - and everyone goes and has a good time.  \n\nIf she's doing this to have attention focussed on her, then she'll leave.\n\nIf, after talking about it, she works through her feelings in the matter, you guys can all go out and have a great time.   You can remember it as the evening where you all became closer because you could both celebrate a friend's new future and comfort a friend who found out her Mom was a jerk.\n\nWin-win.\n\nKicking her out of the bridal party is a jerk move and yeah, that would make you TA.", "ESH.

FAS can be completely debilitating to a person. A guy who lived in the basement of a house I rented had FAS and he couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t really build functional relationships, and could barely take care of himself. I moved out after I found DOZENS of my and various female roommates underwear that he\u2019d been stealing from the laundry (I had been travelling a lot, and it was over like a year. You never expect someone is stealing your underwear). I moved out bc I was uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t BLAME him. He has a disability. Now I\u2019m not saying the friend here is this level of disabled, but FAS has super real implications for people and how they\u2019re able to live their lives. \n\nOP, I totally get that you\u2019re disappointed.

Yes, she messed up but maybe having a discussion about how she hurt you might be better. ESH", "YTA for kicking her out over this. Complete bridezilla behavior. \n\nI'm willing to bet something about the drinking triggered her. Also women get drunk and cry, it happens.

Couldn't you just have dried her tears, and proceeded with your plans for the Bachelorette? If she didn't feel she could participate,  you should've sent her home in an Uber, same as you'd do for someone with a migraine, and check up with her in the morning. Your bridesmaids are not robots, they might have an emotion or two. Your role is to lead the way with compassion and sympathy, rolling with the upsets and sticking to your master plan.

If she had such an issue with alcohol she could\u2019ve excused herself from YOUR weekend or that one specific night in particular.

Maybe at some point yall can be closer friends again, but I would definitely give each other space right now.", "NTA.

There\u2019s so many expectations around it. Like is your bachelorette party really that important that you\u2019re going to uninvite one of your best friends??? I dunno. Weddings never go as planned and it\u2019s a lot more fun for everyone if people stop having weird expectations of perfection and instead just celebrate the moment with people you care about.\n\nAlso, a person with FAS is legitimately disabled in a way that affects behavior so maybe don\u2019t judge her so harshly?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nAnd I doubt this will be your only/last bachelorette party", "NTA this feels like an attention grab by your friend. It may not have been intentional but either way I think you did the right thing. Be prepared that she will spend your whole wedding moaning about not being a bridesmaid because you found out about her fetal alcohol syndrome. It might be good to have someone deputized to eject her if necessary. Yikes what was she thinking?", "Damn I think I\u2019m the AH because when I read that she found out 3 months earlier and decided to tell EVERYONE the night of the bachelorette I started laughing. (Obviously this is very serious and I feel for OPs friend but waiting 3 months then dropping this at the worst time got me) Overall I think this is a ESH for both of you. \n\nLook this is rough and I do think she sucks for making the night about her. Of course her feelings are valid and I feel for her, but there is a time and place for things and if she wasn\u2019t up for going out she could have stayed home. However, kicking her out of the party so close to the wedding is really not cool. Especially since it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re reimbursing her for what she has spent.  \n\nPersonally I think she should still be in your wedding party and you should sit down with her and tell her how you felt about what happened.  Your feelings matter too but you can still give her support, I don\u2019t think she meant to ruin the night so I wouldn\u2019t damage the friendship further over this.", "YTA\n\nYour friend was in distress. I'm sorry she ruined the night of your bachelorette party, but frankly that's really not a big deal night. \n\nHowever, instead of discussing how it made you feel and how you think it was inappropriate, you boot her from your wedding party for what reason? Punishment? Prevention? Deterrent? Any way you cut it, that was mean.", "YTA - you think that maybe going out AND DRINKING triggered her and she couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer? Sounds like she\u2019s been trying not to burden you this because it seems like you like to hog the spotlight and aren\u2019t supportive.  Aren\u2019t you supposed to be her friend? But she has an actual crisis and you throw her out of your bridal party? Yikes. Seriously, take a hard look at your relationships, do any of them have depth, or are these just party/Instagram friends?", "YTA. \n\nWhat your friend is experiencing is traumatic. It's forcing her to re-evaluate her identity and her relationship with her mother. You complain that she has known for 3 months and insinuate you believe that is a long time. In terms of trauma, it is still considered recent. So recent that she may still be dealing with shock. It's possible she hadn't told you because she's still processing and didn't know to tell you. Trauma eclipses rational thought and affects memory. \n\nDid it occur to you she, someone who was recently diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, was maybe triggered by alcohol? It's possible she was so flooded with emotions (and possible physical symptoms) that she felt she had no choice but to tell you. Before you claim she should have anticipated this, trauma responses can be unpredictable in general. They'd be even more unpredictable for your friend right now since the event just happened. Maybe she had been avoiding alcohol until now. \n\nRegardless of the particular details, your friend came to you vulnerable in search of support. You did the exact opposite and may have actually re traumatized her. Trauma is inherently isolating. It's likely she feels alone and like others can't relate. It can also make you feel deep shame, guilt and fear being seen as a burden to others. What you have done by exiling her from your bridal party is isolate her further and likely made her feel ashamed and like a burden for \"ruining\" your bach. Whether intentional or not you were cruel. If you care about your friend, apologize, make her your bridesmaid again and listen to her nonjudgmentally.", "ESH. I get the bridesmaid wanting to share this with her friends but this was not the moment. It might have felt super critical to her at the moment but it was selfish to take the whole party and bring it down. \n\nBut bride didn\u2019t need to cut her out as bridesmaid. That seems petty and unnecessary. If this is a good, lifelong friend, then cutting her out will have consequences. If bride is ok with that, ok. But it just seems like more some unfortunate bad timing to me.", "ESH. Idk how y\u2019all live like this.

Do you actually believe her reaction was within her control? Was she having a trauma reaction?

It took less than 10 minutes of my time to take her aside, hug her, tell her it's ok and not her fault, listen to her and decide together if she should stay or go home with reassurance that I'm not mad. She left, party resumed just fine. I caught up with her the next day to discuss her problems in more detail. No friendship was damaged, no one was mad. At most, a few people asked me if she was ok.

During a quiet moment one of my bridesmaids took me aside and told me that about three months ago she was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Obviously I asked her what that meant for her and she started crying because she feels differently about her relationship with her mother. We met in elementary school and she\u2019s always had a learning disability, but she didn\u2019t know that there was a preventable cause. My other bridesmaids noticed her crying, and the evening ended up being about her. We skipped out on going to a bar in the limo I had hired because she was upset. I thought about it all today and ended up emailing her to tell her that she took away an important moment from my life. I feel bad about this happening to her, but even though she didn\u2019t always know it\u2019s been going on for her whole life. If this was a recent thing she found out about or it was some kind of deadly disease I would feel differently, but she was sitting on this for months before bringing it up at an event that was supposed to be special to me. You only get one bachelorette and mine was totally overshadowed. I felt really hurt that she did that, and told her that I didn\u2019t want to have her in my wedding if that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to treat me at a time where the focus was supposed to be something good in my life instead of something sad in hers. She could have waited a few more weeks until after the wedding if she wanted to have this conversation. She\u2019s still invited to the wedding but I don\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid after this. I was just texting my cousin (my maid of honour) and she disagreed with me doing this. She said that it sucked that we didn\u2019t go to the bar, but this other friend has already paid for her dress so I should just let her stay. My fianc\u00e9 supports my choice, but I wanted another opinion. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe take some time to reflect on your values and friendships and what is important to you. Chances are one day you'll be in a similar situation where you need support or comfort...how would you want to be treated? I think this is sort of a learning experience for you.

She knew what she was doing. It makes sense to cut her out of the wedding now as a precaution than having regrets later.", "ESH - including the other bridesmaids. \n\nI was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis the day of my friends wedding rehearsal. The 4 of us (bride +3 bridesmaids including myself) have been best friends for over a decade and everyone knew about my appointment that day. I told one bridesmaid on the way to the rehearsal and we discussed how long I could reasonably wait to tell the other two about the official diagnosis. I had waited a couple of months before telling them all about the potential diagnosis, (just until I\u2019d met with my neurologist and received a probable diagnosis, pending an MRI to confirm) and my delay had not gone over well with them. So we decided that I could probably get away with waiting until just after the wedding, but that if anyone asked, that I needed to be fully upfront and honest and then put a pin in it to discuss later. The 3rd bridesmaid asked right at the end of the church portion. Luckily the bride and groom were still busy with the priest so didn\u2019t hear. 3rd bridesmaid made a shocked and very quick devastated expression then quickly moved on when I told her the diagnosis was confirmed and that we\u2019d talk about it later to not distract from the wedding. I honestly did not expect (hoped I guess) the bride to even remember that I\u2019d had my appointment until after the wedding\n\nThe bride did ask about my appointment later on that evening and I told her that I\u2019d been diagnosed, assured her that I was ok and that she could ask me more questions if she wanted, but that all the information would keep until next week. She nodded, we shared smiles of support for each other, and all went out for coffee the next week to discuss treatment, prognosis, next steps etc. The rest of the weekend we all just had fun celebrating the couple. We did talk about it off and on through the weekend when the 4 of were alone. Mostly just me answering any questions that were distracting them and then moved on to whatever was next on whoever\u2019s mind. If it looked like anyone was getting stuck on it, one of the bridesmaids would distract everyone with something else wedding related and it refocused everyone back onto the day. TBH this was easy as we told no one else so anytime anyone walked by or was in the room it wasn\u2019t talked about. \n\nAll the bridesmaids should be working together to make sure the focus stays on the bride\u2026 including the bride\u2019s own focus. It\u2019s normal for people\u2019s minds to wander when things are busy or stressful, but it\u2019s the bridesmaids main job to make sure events scheduled for the wedding stay on track.\n\nRemoval from the bridal party entirely depends on the friendship. No real harsh judgement on the bride. I think a discussion first would have been a better way to handle it, but she knows the friend and the friendship better than anyone else. \n\nThe friend pulling her aside on that night just to tell her, unprompted, about a 3 month old discovery was an asshole move. It could have waited until after the weekend. Her other bridesmaids should have refocused everyone\u2019s attention back onto the bachelorette party and the activities they had also likely spent a fair bit of time planning and coordinating. It never should have taken over the entire night or lead to the cancelling of anything. If I was any one of her bridesmaids I\u2019d be busting my ass to try to plan almost anything in the short time left until the wedding to make up my failure to her. Special dinner, spa day, something the bride loves doing and just doing that thing. Something she doesn\u2019t have to plan or pay for or use any of her energy to rearrange for. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a bride so don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be upset at the other bridesmaids, but no bride I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid for has been anywhere close to drama caused by someone else at their bridal events\u2026 Maybe I\u2019ve just been part of good bridesmaid teams, but I thought that was the main thing you were supposed to do?", "if people stop putting so much importance in their weddings/bachelor/bachelorettes parties, others will stop ruining them. you can ruin something that's already not a big deal", "ESH", "I really do not blame the bride for excluding her from the wedding because she might do it again and then the wedding would be about her.

If someone is having a medical emergency you take them to a hospital not your house. \n\nAlso I understand not wanting her in your\nWedding party because it\u2019s pretty obvious your friend might throw the mood on your big day as she did for the Bachte party.  You have every right to try to make this day as perfect as possible. Honestly, she may not be able to handle it...nothing wrong with that.  I say pay her for the dress and any other expenses she may have incurred as a bridesmaid.

If the bridesmaid can\u2019t focus on being there for and supporting the bride, she should be coming as a guest. If the bride can no longer *trust* her to be there for her and support her, the bridesmaid should now come as a guest.

Not that it necessarily makes it ok but we do sometimes have poor judgment when we\u2019ve been drinking. If I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve forgiven friends or vice versa for saying shitty things when we were young and drinking\u2026 \n\nI guess I\u2019d be less inclined to cut her out of the wedding if she was drunk and her judgment was impaired AND she was apologetic the next day and assuring you she\u2019d stay sober at your wedding to avoid a do-over. \n\nBut it sounds like there was no regret or apologies from her so I\u2019m going to guess that she either wasn\u2019t that drunk or she thinks it\u2019s ok to get drunk and make herself the centre of attention. In which case your concerns about the wedding are valid.\n\n2. Does your friend have any kind of history of causing drama or becoming the centre of attention? If not then maybe give her a pass this one time\u2026 but of course that\u2019s contingent on her recognising that she behaved unfairly and apologising which doesn\u2019t seem to have happened.\n\nI really think that\u2019s the biggest issue here. If your friend isn\u2019t sorry for her actions how can you trust her to not repeat them at your wedding?\n\nNTA based on the above reasoning. But I will say there is little point in demoting her rather than just ending the friendship altogether.

Yes, she deserves support because this is life altering. But so are the traditions around weddings and this moment was just poor timing.

It doesn't feel like being in the wedding is in her best interests and honestly, is she really going to be able to support the bride? Weddings are stressful on a bride, this is why there are bridesmaids. I did not hear that she berated her friend or made her feel bad and I don't know how it was framed in the email, so that could factor in for me. But whether it was punitive or not, it may actually be what's in everyone's best interests.", "Yes. YTA. And a mean friend. Get some compassion.", "This is a situation where no one won.  \nESH. For different reasons.  \n\nI don't know your friend, but you do.  \nI'm doing to go with benefit of the doubt, and give my perspective on guessing what may have caused her breakdown at your bachelorette party. \n\nI don't think your friend set out to derail your special night. I don't think she planned to take the spotlight, or put away her diagnosis disclosure for some big moment to get sympathy and attention.  \nYou mentioned she has had a learning disability, her whole life. This is something that can majorly impact someone on so many levels. Developmental trauma, bullying for being \"different\", watching peers pass you whilst you're not teaching the same milestones or you don't think/problemsolve or communicate the same way they do. She's likely dealt with this silently, or privately, on her own or with professional/family support (or even just on her own, if family isn't available).  \n\nThen she receives news that the cause of a source of potential huge amount of difficulty, isolation, struggle and pain was *preventable*. She likely had come to terms with having been dealt an unlucky hand- just being born such a way. So to have her *entire life story* basically given an enormous footnote of \"by the way- this wasn't a tragic case of natural causes, this was preventable\" is so emotionally jarring. Your whole worldview and personal perception gets rug-pulled from beneath you.  \n\nThere's an added element of extreme hurt to FASD here, too. The absolute heartwrenching feeling (I'd imagine, again, I don't have FASD so I'm just speculating) of *abandonment*, *failure* and *unloving* by your mother.  \nI could imagine all the questions that would have run through your friend's head after finding out about her diagnosis.  \n*Why didn't my own mother love me enough to stop drinking?*  \n*Why didn't my mother love me enough to prevent this?*  \n*Does my mother love me?*  \n*Did my mother ever love me?*  \n*Why did my mother choose alcohol over me?*  \n\nNow, for the night in question.  \nWhy would it have come up on your bachelorette party night?  \nOverwhelming, emotionally shattering and life-exploding events like major diagnoses don't tend to just \"settle\" into your mind nicely. They can be traumatic, or at least in my experience, the reaction to it can be similar to trauma. The emotions come and go, waves of them, sometimes triggered by things, sometimes completely randomly. Some days I'd be completely fine, having a good time with friends, then suddenly be hit with grief at the life I could have had, if I'd been diagnosed in childhood. Or I'd be triggered by something.  \n\nThe night was to celebrate you getting married. A major milestone for you, and for many women in your peer age group.  \nI would guess that when confronted with a party, in which the whole event was dedicated to celebrating this; the beautiful dresses and outfits, the makeup, the hair, the laughter and fun and excitement, the talk about the wedding and the anticipation, the energy of the whole night, it absolutely could have triggered your friend.  \nAnd it could have done so *catching her completely off-guard*.  \n\nShe probably was super excited for you, wanting to go and have a wonderful time. She likely looked forward to something exciting and fun to get her mind off of her own stuff!  \nBut triggers don't always make themselves clear until they're, well... Triggered.  \n\nAnd I can imagine how it went down. She likely took all the stimuli of the event in, and the excitement started to turn into thinking. Thinking about her life, her own journey. Her relationships or lack of. All the times she thought about marriage or weddings. How her learning disability impacted it. How early feelings of isolation or being \"different\" (aka, \"unlovable\") played into fears of not being able to fulfil her dreams or goals for romance and future partnerships. Any problems or tensions she has had in relationships, that may have been caused or heightened by her (what she now knows is) FASD. And then the anger and grief of knowing, *it didn't have to be like this*. That, if her own mother didn't love or care enough to prioritise her, then who will?  \nThen comes the overwhelming emotions. The rational and reasoning part of the brain shutting down (if she has been traumatised by the diagnosis, or from any incidents relating to her FASD), and she's gonna be going entirely off fight/flight.  \n\nNone of that is planned. None of that is to upstage you, to take away from you. None of it is to spite you, or ruin your night, or derail your special event.  \n\nOP, I don't want to diminish your emotions in this, either. Having such a significant night taken away from you, even if it was unintentionally, hurts a lot. Especially if you've had this kind of thing happen before, or if you've never really had a chance to have your time, to be noticed or be honoured and celebrated before.  \nIt's okay to feel hurt here. It's okay to feel a loss for the night that should have been your special night.  \n\nBut I'd encourage you to not direct that hurt and upset *at* your friend. Because I'd be betting she never intended this to happen, and couldn't predict it happening in a million years.  \n\nYou're hurting, and she's hurting. Both hurts are valid.  \n\nI'd recommend giving yourself some time and space to cool off. Acknowledge your hurt, and your feelings about the loss of your night. Then also take some time to reflect on your friend and her position- try to consider how you feel had you experienced the childhood she had, and then found out that your mother had been the cause of your learning disability.  \n\nWhen you feel like you can approach the situation in a grounded and open place, reach out to your friend for a conversation *in person*.  \nI'd really suggest that you apologise, but only if you mean it and understand why an apology is needed.  \nFrom there, talk to her. If she opens up about her situation, listen. Actively listen to what she has been experiencing and feeling. If she gives you the opportunity and wants to listen to you, talk to her about how you felt that night, and why you reacted the way you did. Tell her what you felt after reflecting.  \n\nThen have a conversation with her about how you *both* want to proceed with the wedding. How you can support each other, what she needs from you as a friend, what you need from her as a friend, and what you both have capacity for.   \n\nAfter this, if it goes well, I'd also recommend looking at an impromptu bachelorette party. Talk to your friend about what she thinks would be a good idea, if she is up to the task. If she isn't too confident or is uncertain, then just do something simple. A limo and night out, a brunch, a poolside brunch or high tea. Get one of your bridesmaids to plan a contingency plan for if your friend becomes overwhelmed or triggered; your fiance picks her up and takes her home, one of the bridesmaids stays sober to drive her home, or orders an uber for her. \n\nYour wedding is a great time to celebrate you and your partner. It'll also be a great time to have those you love, there to witness and support you. Take the opportunity to reach out with love, so that you can proceed into your future with love.   \n\nBest of luck.", "I think this is exactly what happened.

She was hit with why she has struggled because her mother drank at bars, at home, wherever.  That diagnosis is not something you get from mom having a drink or two - that means mom was drinking regularly during pregnancy.  It may have overwhelmed her before she could get it under control.  Does she need help - yes, was it the best time - no.  But you kicked a lifelong friend out of your wedding over a onetime incident?  \n\nYtAH.

You could\u2019ve taken charge after everyone noticed and the evening started to turn.

Bar hopping to celebrate the actual big event? You are saying well she\u2019s know she\u2019s had a developmental disability what\u2019s the big deal\u2026\u2026the big deal is her mother caused it. It was preventable. The person who raised her caused her developmental disability, the person who raised her knew she drank through the pregnancy and never said anything. Every struggle she\u2019s had in life has been from the choices of the person she called mom. You don\u2019t like her timing, well it sounds like she was trying to be there for you, but being around alcohol was making her upset, it could even be plausible that she told you because she felt like it was noticeable that she was having a hard time and wanted to let you know why. She\u2019s honestly better off that you \u201cfired\u201d her. She didn\u2019t ruin your bachelorette party, you let it ruin your party. By the way, you can have another bachelorette party. Hell, you can have it before your wedding. She will never be able to look at her mother the same again. This isn\u2019t \u201csomething sad,\u201d this is something that has traumatized her. You said it\u2019s not fatal; research shows of individuals diagnosed with FASD, 43% have contemplated suicide and 23% have made a serious attempt. Not only that, the person she would\u2019ve turned to for support with this, her mom, is no longer a support, her choices were the cause.

Her ex bridesmaid traveled 4 hours for every get together only to tell the bride at one gathering that she may have to leave the wedding early because she was undergoing treatment for cancer and the latest bit had her very low on energy but still wanted to be there to celebrate her wedding. She got uninvited because of the vain excuse of she ruined practice, the mood, the tone and the bride didn't want a sick bridesmaid or a sick guest.  And if your wondering, no, the bride didnt reimburse her travel or her dress or for the engagement party or bachelorette.

I would be mortified, even if my breakdown was understandable.\n\nI don't think people are realizing how long 3 months is to sit on a diagnosis. Think about your life on January 11th this year, and now think about how LONG ago that was and how easy it would have been to call a friend and get some help between then and now.

While it's been hard, I never had to experience a sudden definitive fact like being diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome and have no idea how I would have dealt with that.\n\nI honestly don't know how much that other person is to blame. Depending on what is going on in their head, we can't know whether the meltdown was an unfortunate accident or a pre-planned play for sympathy. Perhaps they were actively working on processing the trauma, thought they had made significant process, but then when the time came close to going to the bar, they had a major setback. On the other hand perhaps the friend is also into drama and decided to use the event for their own needs.", "It begs the question though if OP's friend felt the need to hold out on this secret for so long just to drop it on one of the most important days of her life what should she expect if her friend doesn't get any repercussions for the initial act\n\n'Hey guys welcome to the reception most important day of my life to kick off the night one of my Bridesmaids has a speech to share'\n\n'Thanks OP I hope the first day of the rest of your life is one to remember, that being said I have an announcement to share I'm having a baby and I hope to give it it's best chance unlike my mother did for me as she was careless before I was born!

It could be that the bridesmaid thought she could handle it but when facing a party she thought about what partying had done to her life, it got big and she spilled the news. At least she pulled the bride aside instead of making some kind of announcement.

ACCEPT an invitation to a PARTY), that is supposed to be a last hurrah, leave the million worries outside or don\u2019t come to the party that\u2019s supposed to be focused on someone else. Stealing that focus is inexcusable, because it can\u2019t be undone. Knowing this is something her bridesmaid is capable of, and removing that possibility from the main event seems prudent to me. \n\nI mean, this wasn\u2019t just some birthday party, or random weekend and the bridesmaid should have known that going in.", "The friend ruined a major life event for Op.

This appears to be a case of dueling divas, one incensed about the violation of the Day/Week/Month/Year of Me, and one who\u2019s going to be \u201ctriggered\u201d with such theatricality everybody else needs to stop the bus.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why the bride, if she\u2019s so invested in the limo and the bar crawl or whatever, didn\u2019t treat it like literally any other illness: \u201coh, I\u2019m so sorry, how awful for you, I completely understand if you don\u2019t feel up to going out with us. Do you want us to bring you back a takeaway?\u201d\n\nThe expulsion from the wedding sounds like an attempt to wrestle back the drama stick through overreaction.\n\nIncidentally:\n\n\u201cYou only get one bachelorette.\u201d Umm, remarriage statistics don\u2019t really bear that out.", "The issue is the timing, not that the friend came to her with an issue. It's that she waited until a very, very, very specific day to lay this shit out in the open.", "I can't even imagine being friends with someone who treats their other friends that way. I wonder how other bridesmaids feel.", "OP is just playing defense at this point.\n\nAs you yourself stated, those living with FAS don't show good judgement. So, instead of rolling the dice (again) and involving someone who clearly has poor judgement in the choreography of her wedding day, she's removing any potential breakdowns in the future and ensuring that her wedding goes off smoothly.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, this makes sense.", "> She was most likely triggered by the alcohol and by the possibility of someone being pregnant and maybe not knowing.\n\nThen she also might have the same reaction at the wedding. By the sounds of it, this won't be a dry one. \n\nSo if anything, OP is just playing defense and preventing the possibility of another meltdown on a more important day. If OP's friend ruins the wedding, would you keep the sentiment you've already expressed?\n\n> I get that you didn't get do what you wanted for your Bachelorette party but big deal. I don't understand why people get so wrapped up in these parties.\n\nWedding days are actually a big deal, and to more than one person. OP is just ensuring that the big day goes off smoothly at this point.", "LOL WHAT?? Bachelorette's happen every day?? Yea no fucking shit!! But your OWN bachelorette happens ONCE and IS special. You sound very very young so I guess I'm not surprised by your comment, but you're absolutely wrong here like wtf.", "the whole point of a bachelorette party is for it to be all about her. the friend knew abt the diagnosis for MONTHS and chose to selfishly make the night about her. op is nta", "I mean she\u2019s had it her whole life tho??? \n\nGuys she didn\u2019t just get FAS. If she had such poor decision making her entire life, I don\u2019t think OP would have been as surprised and thrown!! \n\nBut clearly this is some interesting new behavior. She was just diagnosed, but she\u2019s had this her entire life literally since birth. It\u2019s a bit rich that suddenly she has a disability that prevents her from stealing the spotlight accidentally.", "> It's just an [event somebody else is paying for, to celebrate something important to them, that you don't need to attend if it's a burden]! Waaaaaaaah why don't you invite us to your celebrations??\n\n100% this! Honestly her friend should cover the costs of the limo and everything else they missed out on. Imagine losing thousands of dollars because for your bachelorette party and others are expecting you to be cool with it when your friend had 3 months to discuss this issue.", "Actually recent studies have shown that symptoms of fasd can be caused by even one drink early on in the pregnancy so it could be that her mom drank before she even knew she was pregnant, not every mom of a kid with fasd is terrible and chose to drink while knowing they were pregnant", "I have a friend who is a set of triplets and all 3 have FAS and my friend is the only one is a functioning adult but one sister got married and has a baby but has developed remembering important things like feeding her baby so she and her husband live with her parents so they can help her and this is a recent development and the middle daughter is functioning like a 12 year old and very short attention span. These girls are in their 20\u2019s.\n My friend seems to be doing great but she gets overwhelmed very easily and will lash out when she gets over tired and she doesn\u2019t realize it until later.\n My friend and her sisters are adopted.\n\n My friend said that they all have different personalities and they each have different triggers such as routines.\n\n My friend said that her parents sent the middle child to church camp but since she didn\u2019t have her routines they had to go get her so I am wondering if OP\u2019s friend was also overly tired and overwhelmed. My friend did say once that even though they knew about their FAS they still have trouble with following through with big things like planning for a holiday or something away from home or something big going on in their lives and they would just say that it was not a big deal but the bigger the event the bigger the issue of following through with certain things and activities.\n \n OP please talk with your friend. She may not realize how you feel about her taking the opportunity from you. Being a bridesmaid may truly been to much for her once she realized how close to the wedding is. I honestly don\u2019t think she did it on purpose or for attention but she took something from you that can\u2019t be replaced.\n\n Someone suggested that you have a do over for your bachelorette party and just not invite her. That would be a great idea for you and your other bridesmaids.", "Thanks for this post. Right! I just keep forgetting how pervasive ableist perspectives are. Now I am less flabbergasted at all these bizarro NTA comments blasting the ex-bridesmaid, and just irritated at how little thought people give to anyone without their exact lived experience.", "I think it was the fact that alcohol was involved.", "Out in the open??? She took op aside and told her", "It\u2019s also very much assumed there\u2019s going to be alcohol at a bachelorette party it\u2019s not like that was a surprise. This girl is very self centered and I don\u2019t blame OP for doing what she did", "Yes, I agree. I also wondered about that!\n\nI can only assume that either they don\u2019t know her well or they\u2019re all used to dropping everything to focus on her when her emotions escalate quickly and it\u2019s a common pattern over the years", "Lol. Wedding culture is so hilariously entitled. Imagine any other context where someone is expecting you to spend thousands of dollars on making their dreams come true, getting you to take time off work, focus entirely on them, etc.And then telling you how privileged you are to be allowed to do that for them.", "Exactly. It's a shit situation for every one but sometimes you have to sit with your feelings and stay home or know when to hold onto things until a better time. I hate that the bride lost money on the limo and didn't get her bachelorette weekend. Now she ends up looking like a jerk for being rightfully upset that when she looks back on that weekend instead of remembering a good time it turned into a night consoling someone else.", "I agree, there are times when cancelling plans to support a friend are warranted. But a Bachelorette or birthday party is definitely not one of those times.", "I can sympathize and she can still be in the wrong. Can't hold it together and going to ruin a once in a lifetime event? \"Oh I'm sorry I'm feeling light headed and sick all of a sudden. I'm gonna call an Uber don't worry about me\". You can explain in a couple days.", "That's some tea, not some 'sad' news.", "If that is the case, and friend cannot grasp the proper social etiquette of celebrations and not overshadowing the people those celebrations are about, then even better that she was removed from the bridal party, as she may have unintentionally caused issues at the wedding as well.  By the time you are an adult, even if you are not neurotypical, you have likely been to plenty of celebrations (birthdays, weddings, bridal/baby showers, graduations, etc) and should have at least some grasp of the social aspects. Even as someone with autism I know better than to make someone else's party about me and my problems.", "I can see both sides of this issue but when OP took her aside she had the perfect opportunity to ask her friend not to say anything until they had the time to talk one on one.\n\n I wonder if the friend had made other things about her before at other events or if she did have a trigger with the alcohol and going to a bar. I just don\u2019t know what the right answer is.", "Yes. This \ud83d\udc46 You only get one wedding (hopefully)", "I am with you and feel like I would have actually intervened and been the bad guy if I were one of the other bridesmaids, pulled her aside and sent her home if she couldn't bring the right energy. I have done it before. It actually takes work to keep the vibe straight when you have a lot of people drinking like that. It's not unreasonable to expect adults to have emotional control.", ">.  \n>  \n>I also have a personal rule.  \n>  \n>No serious talk around alcohol!  \n>  \n>Stupid arse shit only!\n\nDrunk people aren't exactly known for their self-control. As in picking suitable topics. Drunk people aren't fun to deal in general unless you're managing to vibe well enough.", "Exactly. There's a time and place. My heart breaks for ops friend who feels betrayed by her mother. But you have to know and do better in these situations.", "Exactly. There is way too much money involved in these events to risk someone ruining not one, but two of them. It also really shows someones character and how selfish they are if they do some shit like this. \n\nFor me, not only would they be immediately out of the wedding party, but it would take a damn good while for me to want to even be friends with them anymore.", "Thank you for this, I literally hate when I see people spreading this misinformation.", "I'm a giggly, happy drunk who goes around hugging my friends and telling them I love them _except_ when I was depressed. Drinking made me cry! It was really bad. I know I was a downer and I can't believe anyone put up with me! So I stopped drinking at all during that phase in my life. For me, alcohol amplifies my overall mood.", "Does your cousin have a drinking problem? I always used to find that I'd become emotionally volatile when drinking...sometimes I'd be the life of the party and other times I'm sure I was awful to be around. I was never the type of alcoholic that developed such an addiction that I was seeking it or going through DTs if I didn't have it. I was just not the type of drinker that seemed fun to be around. At a point in my life I decided it wasn't worth the risk and I'm more fun to be around sans drinking. If your cousin has a pattern where they can't regulate their emotions it might be nice to offer some support when they are sober and gently bring it to their attention.", "Yea...it was where and when she told the news.  Like, OP should probably have a full sit down after the wedding, but if the friend legitimately couldn't control the impulse to share this personal information at an important event for her friend, then maybe she shouldn't be involved with an even bigger event. Weddings are stressful enough even when your bridal party is chill.", "Agree with this one. Even if the bridesmaid was unable to control the trigger, she should have reached out on her own to apologize. And a solid one, not just a \"sorry if last night affected you\". Even if everyone was reassuring and kind during the emotional breakdown (which most people with empathy will be), someone would be an absolute saint to not be hurt/upset over this. Expecting a friend to take that in stride is entitled\n\nIf the bridesmaid had an uncontrollable breakdown, she's probably not in a good enough emotional state to support the bride on the wedding day. If she had the ability and decided not to control the breakdown and/or didn't think an apology was necessary - pretty selfish and those don't make good bridesmaids either\n\nIf the email was moderate to kind, OP isn't the asshole. Unless the Maid of Honor is a pushover type though, it sounds like OP's email might have been a bit harsh", "I agree when you're going out parting that it should be fun. But keep one thing in mind the society that a lot of our parents grew up in was all about keeping it bottled up and our parents tried to enforce the same thing on us mainly the males I saw my brother go through this. When you drink it lessens your control of what you say or do and if you have stuff bottled up it may or may not come out. So I hope you at least keep this in mind cause it's not like they are intentionally doing it the bottle just opened a bit.", "That's a pretty shitty rule.  Divorces take a lot longer than 45 days, lots of shitty life events drag out for a while. That's one of the hard things about terminal illnesses, divorce, etc is that it drags on a long time, and everyone gets bored and you're still in the thick of it, but with no support.  If you experience this, I hope your friends show more empathy than you are.\n\nDraw your boundaries how you want, and if you don't want to be there for your friends emotionally if it doesn't fit your timeline, that's your choice.  But there's a nicer way to do it than telling your friend you don't care and that no one else cares either.", "I feel terribly for any bartenders that have had to deal with you and your friends after ten drinks.", "YTA", "Exactly.  Bridesmaid likely WAS trying to keep this from OP, but it just bubbled over.\n\nDoesn't help that some of the effects of FASD are poor impulse control, difficulty reasoning, and difficulty identifying consequences.", "Something tells me this person is not actually very fun to be around despite their rules for fun.", "YTA\n\nBecause nothing is ever all about you.", "ESH: I feel like she shouldn\u2019t have taken away from your evening that you spent a lot of effort and money on, however she could\u2019ve felt the need to get it off her chest as the drinking at the party could\u2019ve possibly been triggering. She should\u2019ve removed herself, but you should\u2019ve also spoken with her in a very human way about how it hurt you", "definitely giving YTA. i know it\u2019s your wedding but other people\u2019s lives don\u2019t stop just because of that. now don\u2019t get me wrong, she could\u2019ve withdrawn from the event after telling you her very valid reasoning, so she could potentially be one too, but three months is a very short time, especially for genuine trauma where the environment is a direct trigger of her situation. your bachelorette is going to be *drowning* in alcohol if its 1) a bachelorette and 2) hosted at a bar. she could\u2019ve told you sooner but she also was likely trying to strong and put her stuff aside for you, and like everyone else here who clearly hasn\u2019t experienced it first hand in the past, thought three months would be enough time to \u201cget over it\u201d. but if your mother died three months ago and you were invited to something that reminds you of it, would you not cry? would you not be upset and want to leave, even if you went there initially trying to support a friend in a major life event? because in a way, her mother did die. she\u2019s trying to figure it all out because she still loves her mother, and there\u2019s all the memories that she\u2019s had with her. but something else in her mind would be the literal fact that her mother may or may not have had a complete disregard for her life, safety, and general well-being all before she was ever even born. in a way, that woman she\u2019s known all her life is now dead to her, even if she doesn\u2019t want her to be. and me personally, i have family deaths that i can\u2019t get over/ can be triggering at times from almost 10 years ago. not to mention that you specifically stated that she has/ had developmental issues. not sure how severe, but it can be difficult for her to process all those extremely complex feelings, thoughts, and emotions, even if she didn\u2019t have anything else going on. i\u2019m glad that it happened however, she now knows that she has a friend who doesn\u2019t actually consider her mental well-being or finances that she\u2019s put into her own event, but the person who\u2019s back-stabbing her. she now is able to learn that, when it comes to her, you\u2019ll always put #1 first, and not to have you around for emotional support (which she potentially put off for you in the first place) in her very difficult time.\n\nedit (forgot to add this in there): if someone, a friend, sees you crying, would you not tell them why? it seems like her original intention was to tell only you and another friend came to support her because she has empathy and a lack of narcissism.", "ESH - her timing sucks, and you are a terrible friend.  Like, point blank, there is no one innocent in this.", "You cousin is right!. She had been sitting on this knowledge for months, probably months that you all had been together planning and was trying to keep inside and now she couldn't anymore. \n\nShe already paid for her dress, you should pay her back for that if you are truly going to tell her she is out of the wedding now\n\nESH", "YTA \n\nShe trusted you, her friend, with something that is tearing her apart inside and you dump her.", "You say she is a friend why not pull her aside and have a conversation instead of just kicking her out??", "Holy shit this is cold. You don\u2019t deserve friends.", "YTA. This thing where brides think everything should be about them is very distasteful.", "Yta, very cruel and selfish to kick her out of your wedding party especially at a hard time in her life. I would have been 100% supportive if a friend had told me this, even if it was at my bachelorette party. That is way more important than celebrating.", "YTA. She has a leaning disability, so I would imagine that tact and timing are not her strong point either.", "Based on the update, you're not. I love the attitude!", "OP said she also had learning disabilities, and is it possible her condition is contributing to her social faux pas?", "Yeah, I'm leaning towards NTA too. \n\nI was MOH for my bff recently and a girl in her bridal party had a traumatic incident happen the morning of the wedding (her brother had to have emergency brain surgery). She came to me quietly and explained the situation, and said that she didn't want to take away from the wedding, and asked me to cover for her when she needed to leave to answer phone calls, cry, whatever. \n\nI helped her out, made up excuses when she needed to slip away, made sure she had everything she needed, and the bride had no clue.\n\nShe and I weren't even close, but she knew that if she told the bride, the focus would be taken away from the wedding. She got the support she needed to handle her emotions without ruining the wedding day.\n\nThe bridesmaid in OPs story knew for months. She could've cried about it at any other time. She either chose that moment maliciously, or something came up during the bachelorette and she didn't regulate her emotions properly.", "\"Compassion\" and \"grace.\" Words so often missing in our lives. But so, so important. \n\nWonderful post.", "And what's to prevent that from happening again at the wedding? When there will be even more alcohol and more stress?", ">People are acting like she knew a trauma response was coming\n\nThis. I find myself having a lot of empathy for the friend in this situation. I was a bridesmaid once. Two weeks before the wedding I was broken up with in a very upsetting manner. Still, I followed the brides every demand and spent a ridiculous amount of money to make her happy.I went to the bachelorette party, I went to the rehearsal, I spent the night in the hotel with her before the big day. I made it through the ceremony. After the ceremony while pictures were being taken my anxiety came to a rapid head and I became physically ill, literally projectile vomiting over the railing of the gazebo we were in. I offered to clean myself up and continue.I did my best for the reception, I danced the stupid dances. I had no car, no way to leave. When the bride returned from the honeymoon she sent me a nasty email about how I looked miserable and she was angry.Needless to say, we're not friends anymore. She had her bachelorette party, wedding and her honeymoon and still could not muster an ounce of compassion for me as I pushed myself to attend and pay for her borderline unreasonable demands.", "God your poor sister.", "Right?? Where is the empathy here?", "People entering a commitment of lifelong empathy, compromise, sacrifice, forbearance, and love (i.e. a marriage) should never have to demonstrate those qualities at their Me, Me, Me day. /S", "I will never understand why people are still unaware that alcohol is a depressant, and it does just that, especially if you are depressed. Drinking is one of the last things you should do when you're upset about anything. That's when it leads to crying, screaming, and fighting. I always make sure I am in the right frame of mind before I drink so that things remain fun and happy. I grew up with 2 alcoholic parents and then dated a few, unfortunately. I myself am a pot smoker, and that definitely doesn't make me cry and sad."]}
