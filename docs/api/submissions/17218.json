In fact, if part of the Live-In Aid's employment package includes a free room, what you sister is doing could actually be illegal. I don't know about Florida Laws, but where I live and formerly managed 30 employees who supported people with disabilities, part of these arrangements REQUIRED the Aid had private room that was not accessible to other people.\n\nExample: Many live in homes provided respite every other weekend. The respite worker was NOT allowed to enter the live-in's room.", "NTA- next time you stay with her kick her out of her room see how she feels then", "Nta your sister is being incredibly invasive. This aid is moved in to take care of your mother and your sister is being rude as hell by kicking her out of her room when she visits.", "NTA and I agree with you 100%", "NTA. Your sister is being pretty disrespectful.", "NTA your sister shouldn\u2019t do that. She\u2019s displacing this aid. It\u2019s her home too. I\u2019m sure room and board are part of her compensation. Tell your sister there could be legal ramifications that can affect your mother financially.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Room n board absolutely part of her comp. We pay her well but that doesn't entitle this nonsense.", "I would seriously check on Florida's Laws. Where I live, this would be a VERY costly mistake, especially if Aid is not being paid hourly for her time when sleeping. I know of a situation where a live-in received back-pay because her room did not meet the requirements. You could end up being responsible for paying her for 8 hours/night for the entire 3 years if your sister does this again.", "We pay her for her time while sleeping there.", "INFO: Is it a set amount per night (Like $50/night) or is it at least minimum hourly wage???", "Wish it was $50/night. We pay a annual salary", "Again, I strongly encourage you to look into Florida Law. The annual salary must be at LEAST minimum wage and could include overtime for all hours above 40/week. Definitely find out about the minimum requirements for the live-in's accommodation meets the state guidelines.\n\nAny way around it, NTA!!! Your sister should absolutely NOT be kicking the aid out of her bedroom!", "It pisses me off to no end.  I hired the woman and apologized profusely.", "NTA Florida employment law for domestic workers states the worker must have  \u201cprivate quarters\u201d ... in a \u201chomelike environment\u201d.\n\nMaking the caregiver sleep on the sofa breaks that law and leaves you/your mom as the employer open to a lawsuit that will likely cost far more than a hotel stay and is just wrong in general.", "NTA your sister is rude.", "When my sister was not willing to budge, offered the aid a hotel. She declined because she didn't want to leave mom.", "I don't get it.", "I think if your sister takes the room she should be paying for the hotel\nAnd be  responsible for all the things your aid would be responsible for in regards to your mother's care.\n\nLet your aid know that she's not responsible on those nights she stays at a hotel, etc. That might put her mind at ease slightly about leaving your mom, but I do doubt it as she has already been caring for her for 3 years.", "Its extremely rude of your sister to use the room.  You are correct", "When i hired her , said to think of it as her home.", "NTA  Get locks for the aide's doors and make sure not to give sis the keys.", "Your sister is an ass", "INFO: Why is the aide agreeing?", "NTA but Y/WBTA to let this continue. Put your foot down. Change the locks if you have to.", "NTA. You note in a comment that the room is part of the aid\u2019s compensation, so your sister is violating the contract when she prevents the aid from using her room. \n\nContract aside, caring for an elderly person is a _huge_ responsibility and a drain on one\u2019s physical and emotional resources (just like caring for a child, except the \u2018child\u2019 is big enough that you can\u2019t just pick them up). I would want the person caring for my parent to be as well-rested and comfortable as possible! \n\nI don\u2019t know if your mother requires toilet assistance, but the one and only time my mom said something disrespectful to me about the CNAs attending my dad at the end of his life, I reminded her that \u201cthose women\u201d change her husband\u2019s _diapers_ and we need to show them courtesy and respect. Feel free to remind your sister of that, too.", "If your sister isn't paying for this service, I'd tell the live-in aid she can just tell your sister to kick rocks.  Obviously it's not her job to fight this battle, and you should be telling your sister off for doing this really awful behavior, but if you can try to empower the aid to not let your sister bully her around.  Maybe have a zoom call with her and your sister and set the record straight?", "NTA. It is indeed.", "I wish i could.", "Big time", "She's got a great gig taking care of mom and doesn't want to rock the boat", "Its not my house!!!  My mother is a big girl, she knows 100%  of my opinion.", "My mother has a walker but does require assistance with the bathroom. I've said to her that the second bedroom is for the person carring for her. If sis wants to stay, she should be taking the responsibility. When i say that its like im speaking a unknown language.", "I can't geet the aid in the middle of this brawl and she is plain too nice to say a word.", "If the living quarters are part of her pay, then her pay is being stolen.  \n\nIt really is that simple.  Your sister, and by extension you and your mom, are stealing from the aid.  \n\nIf the world were just you 3 would be looking at wage theft criminal charges but the US isnt that place.\n\nYTA for not pushing harder.  I also consider you a thief for the wage theft but much less than sister or mom who are both very active participants in the theft.", "Why can't you? I recently put a new door knob on my bedroom with a lock. It took like 10 minutes and cost like $12", "I really empathize with you given how much I know we relied on the CNAs. I hope the legal argument at least will make more sense to your sister. (Part of me wants to suggest that if your sister is adamant about sleeping in the second bedroom, she could pay for the aid to have a nice staycation and spa visit in a nearby hotel and then she (your sister) could do all of the tasks the aid does\u2026but that might be dangerous for your mom as I\u2019m guessing your sister doesn\u2019t know now to assist an elderly person.)", "For sure, I'd probably mention it to her just so she has the confidence to empower herself if your sister does come back uninvited laying out orders to extricate herself from the room.  Just also reiterate that she is under no obligation to fight this if she doesn't want to.  Sorry your sister is shitty on this topic.", "I live 1000 miles away. I've pushed so hard this had led to a estrangement with sister. My blood boils thinking about it.", "its a losing battle", "Its not my house. Ive had this discussion with my mother who is 92 and sharp as a tack. I think moms so happy for the visit she will put up with anything.", "I ceased speaking to my sister. Have had this discussion heatedly. Night time duties are bathroom related only. If she wants to stay in aides roo, she be the aide. I've said this and gotten no where.", "She doesn't want to get into it w sis.", "I know it sucks but explain to everyone involved, including the aid, that taking the room away is theft.  It is part of her pay, it is hers.  It is not your mom's to give away nor your sister's to take.\n\nYou need your mom to understand this most imo.", "My attitude is if my sister takes the room she should take care of mom.", "Will mom be happy if the aide leaves and/or sues her ?", "You try to convince a 92 yo woman to tell her daughter to stay at a hotel. Sister should know better.", "If financially possible, cover hotel fees and take your sister to small claims on the caregiver's behalf.", "Aide isn't going anywhere. We pay too well and mom is easy to take care of.", "That's kinda why I emphasized the theft part.  Maybe she'll understand that stealing from her aid is wrong and just doesnt think of it that way.  \n\nAlso, your mom kinda sucks for not treating the aid like a real person who deserves their own privacy and space.  Maybe she'll be receptive to one of those 2 issues?  Idk, but it is incredibly shitty to treat the aid this way and maybe just explaining why that's the case will work.", "I like your reasoning and will give it a try. I agree with your comments.", "INFO: Is there an enacted Power of Attorney in place?", "I have POA"]}
