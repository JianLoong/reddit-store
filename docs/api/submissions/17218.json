Where I live, this would be a VERY costly mistake, especially if Aid is not being paid hourly for her time when sleeping.

You are correct", "When i hired her , said to think of it as her home.", "NTA  Get locks for the aide's doors and make sure not to give sis the keys.", "Your sister is an ass", "[removed]", "NTA but Y/WBTA to let this continue.

You note in a comment that the room is part of the aid\u2019s compensation, so your sister is violating the contract when she prevents the aid from using her room. \n\nContract aside, caring for an elderly person is a _huge_ responsibility and a drain on one\u2019s physical and emotional resources (just like caring for a child, except the \u2018child\u2019 is big enough that you can\u2019t just pick them up). I would want the person caring for my parent to be as well-rested and comfortable as possible! \n\nI don\u2019t know if your mother requires toilet assistance, but the one and only time my mom said something disrespectful to me about the CNAs attending my dad at the end of his life, I reminded her that \u201cthose women\u201d change her husband\u2019s _diapers_ and we need to show them courtesy and respect. Feel free to remind your sister of that, too.", "If your sister isn't paying for this service, I'd tell the live-in aid she can just tell your sister to kick rocks.

I recently put a new door knob on my bedroom with a lock. It took like 10 minutes and cost like $12", "I really empathize with you given how much I know we relied on the CNAs. I hope the legal argument at least will make more sense to your sister. (Part of me wants to suggest that if your sister is adamant about sleeping in the second bedroom, she could pay for the aid to have a nice staycation and spa visit in a nearby hotel and then she (your sister) could do all of the tasks the aid does\u2026but that might be dangerous for your mom as I\u2019m guessing your sister doesn\u2019t know now to assist an elderly person.)", "For sure, I'd probably mention it to her just so she has the confidence to empower herself if your sister does come back uninvited laying out orders to extricate herself from the room.  Just also reiterate that she is under no obligation to fight this if she doesn't want to.  Sorry your sister is shitty on this topic.", "I live 1000 miles away.

We pay too well and mom is easy to take care of.", "That's kinda why I emphasized the theft part.  Maybe she'll understand that stealing from her aid is wrong and just doesnt think of it that way.  \n\nAlso, your mom kinda sucks for not treating the aid like a real person who deserves their own privacy and space.  Maybe she'll be receptive to one of those 2 issues?  Idk, but it is incredibly shitty to treat the aid this way and maybe just explaining why that's the case will work.", "I like your reasoning and will give it a try.

Like your sister. Who is a real AH.", "NTA, but your sister definitely is! If your mother has a permanent live-in caretaker, the caretaker's room is hers - as if she rented it. Under no circumstances should anyone use her room, unless there is an extreme emergency. What your sister is doing is disrespectful and and invasion of privacy.", "Have you considered telling them that your mother won't have an aide anymore if sister insists on taking the room, as it's part of her compensation? I'm only surprised the aide hasn't left.\n\nNTA, but YWB if you don't lay it all out for them, that it's not just inconvenient for the aide, it's breaking the employment contract.", "NTA.

She has no right to that room.  She has some nerve!", "NTA\n\nIf your sister wants the room, she should pay for the caregiver\u2019s hotel, the caregiver still gets paid for a time off, and sister should take care of your mom. \n\nThe only one who is not AH adjacent is the caregiver. Your sister is TA. \n\nEmployment contracts are no joke.", "More info needed- so what happens if there is no live-in aide? Does mom go to a nursing home? Can she afford a private one at $40,000+ dollars a year or would she be going to a Medicare/Medicaid funded facility? Perhaps a familiarity tour of the correctly afforded facility would be an eye opener. Make sure to point out how any of the staff and other residents can walk right in anyone\u2019s rooms. Point out there are no locks on doors or cabinets. Then stop at Home Depot and get a new doorknob for the aide\u2019s room.", "NTA. Your sister is out of line.

The room is part of her compensation, not a favour.", "Tell your sister to either stay in a hotel or you will be giving the aide the time off for as long as she is in the room and sis can fill in.

My feeling is once is too much.", "I have done so too many times to mention.", "Luckily financially we can cover cost of Live In. 40k a drop in the bucket compared to having 7x24 care in your home. So, that idea would be a non starter.", "My mother is easy. She's got all her marbles. Biggest issue is mobility and companionship. IMO this is a great gig for a caregiver. Probably why she would put up for occasional inconvenience.", "I've tried tried that. First time it happened, I paid for a hotel but aide didn't want to leave mother.", "She would never do it. Think because we pay she feels entitled to do anything.", "Mention the words \"lawsuit\" and \"jail sentence.\"", "That\u2019s fair.", "Lawsuit may get her attention.", "Your mom requires live-in support. This room is a condition of that support. If your mother refuses to understand this, then you tell her you\u2019re not going to be legally liable here and you\u2019re have to arrange to terminate the live-in aid\u2019s employment. \n\nTell her if she trusts your sister that much, she\u2019s welcome to have your sister take over her care completely.", "Something to think of: Cover Your A$$!!! The aide likes her job and doesn't want to rock the boat. At some point, she will no longer be able to be employed by you. \n\nAt that point, she will be free to sue you.  There are plenty of law firms in Florida that will be willing to take her case for a percentage of the settlement. Please, your sister needs to understand how serious this is. Consider consulting with a Florida Attorney who specializes in Home Health Care Aide's Rights. If anything, it will help you understand what liability, if any, you are exposed yourself to.", "I'm going to do that.

Something like A Place for Mom or something like that?\n\nI'm not suggesting that you let them take over for your mom's care. But someone who can verify that all fed/state laws employment and care laws and regulations are being followed. Just a suggestion...", "Make sure you tell her that, as such, she should of course feel free to tell your sister \u201cno, you may not use my room\u201d when she visits. And tell her to reach out to you if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable confronting sister herself. What your sister is doing is flat-out unacceptable. No, I like your word better.. it is despicable. \n\nI would tell sister if she can\u2019t afford a hotel then she needs to sleep on the couch. Whether the support worker is there or not. If she doesn\u2019t want to sleep on the couch, then she doesn\u2019t get to stay over. And if she *CHOOSES* not to visit your mother over this, then she was never visiting for the right reasons anyway. \n\nLet her know that if she doesn\u2019t like the arrangement, SHE can feel free to take over taking care of your mother\u2019s support arrangements, and good luck finding one who\u2019s willing to live in a home where they don\u2019t have a bed. That room is the live-in aid\u2019s room. Maybe she can just move in and take over your mother\u2019s care herself, seeing as she likes the sleeping accommodations so much. \n\nYour mother has *live-in aid.* Live-in help is invaluable to someone like your mother. Someone who they know, who is familiar, who they have developed a relationship with. Your sister is risking this woman quitting (with good reason) and leaving your mother without a trusted aid until new one is found. \n\nIf your sister is still treating a visit to ailing your mother like a crash-pad like she\u2019s a college student coming home for the weekend, she needs to grow the hell up. If she\u2019s there to do anything other than visit and support your mother, let alone literally obstruct her care and risk her mother losing this aid that she needs, she doesn\u2019t need to be there.", "Good choice. I\u2019m sorry, I just assumed terminating your involvement would effectively terminate her employment (which would be a legal nightmare in itself, since your side were the ones who breached the contract in the first place. She could potentially sue). It\u2019s good if they\u2019ve got the resources to keep it going.", "Possibly. Except for this issue, all working well.", "Nta- if your sister wants the room and doesn\u2019t want to leave mom then she should be putting in work and taking care of her.", "The problem with this: The Aide's personal possessions are in her room! That is why, in my state, this is illegal! In WI, even if the aide is not home, it is illegal for someone to enter her room.", "The caregiver also has her personal possessions in her room. That is why this is illegal in my state!", "If you do that, I'm worried that the sister would take it as 'well now it's my room for sure' and do things like leave belongings in the room for storage or go through everything the aide owns in the room.", "Yes, once IS too much.", "OP, you\u2019re purposely being obtuse with every answer. I didn\u2019t ask you if you could afford a live in. I asked you what happens if there is no live in, as in your lady quits and she sues you and the agency won\u2019t send someone else because your family won\u2019t follow the contract. What happens with your mom if there is no paid live in- do you move in, your sister move in, or does mom go to a home?\n\nYou are taking the position that because you/your family can afford to hire someone, that\u2019s the end of your responsibility and it\u2019s perfectly ok for your mom and sister to violate the contract and take advantage of the aide. If that\u2019s your position, just say that. If you are paying the salary and are worried about being sued, then own that and handle it. Move mom to a home and pay them the same money. Move mom to a different house with one more bedroom and have one for sis. Get the aide a lock for her personal space. Do something.", "ask her what makes her think she can do that to a human being? it\u2019s the aids home, and yeah she\u2019s an employee, but even then she takes care of your mother, which your sister doesn\u2019t do. if your sister wants the room, she better be ready to be the aid.", "It's NOT just about where the Aide will sleep. The other problem is the Aide has her personal possessions in her room. It's NOT just about where the Aide will sleep.", "I would if i was on speaking terms with her. I said something along same linewhen this first happened.", "yeah from what you\u2019ve said so far that sounds on par for her. maybe talk to your mom and the aid and suggest a lock on the door, and an air mattress for your sisters next visit. the aid is a necessary piece of the household who deserves respect, and your sister is probably crossing some legal boundary here. besides, there\u2019s only so much a person can take, if i was the aid i would\u2019ve set my foot down a long time ago. your mothers aid sounds like a lovely person, who deserves to be treated like a member of the household. your sister cannot continue to walk all over her.", "When i hired her i said Welcome to our family.", "Pay for someone to come in and put a lock on the aid\u2019s bedroom door. Then only give the key to the aid.  It should be treated as an ADU and not a part of the house.  It\u2019s tacky for your sister to sleep in there. Who\u2019s responsible for cleaning the room and changing the bedding when she leaves? Is she rifling through the aid\u2019s personal belongs? Using the aid\u2019s personal bedding and pillows? \n\nTell your sister to buy a nice sofa bed if she insists on staying at the house.", "good on you! now your sister has to step up too.", "Not likely", "Today i sent mom and her aide mothers day gifts.", "NTA\n\nBut this could be the kind of thing that makes your mom's aide look for another position...\n\nTell your sister that she'll be looking for the next aide.", "NTA can you get a door that locks and give the aid the key? This is most likely illegal, and even if it\u2019s not your sister is being a major AH to the person caring for your elderly mother. Not a good thing to do!", "NTA.  And sorry you have been caught up in this mess.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is TA and disrespectful.", "Could you pay the aid \u201crent for her room\u201d and put her in a hotel when sister visits? This is abhorrent!", "Mom loves her. Good point.", "That seems to be the consensus.", "As little as it happens, its too much.", "Thank you.", "If you're the boss, you need to insist that the aide is fully on paid vacation time while sister is visiting, and sister is 100% responsible for caring for your mother during that time. \n\nYour sister - and mother, frankly - are raging assholes and it's honestly a shame the aide is afraid to sue your family for treating her like garbage.", "This week will include a organized call with mom.", "Seriously, your sister's selfishness and desire to treat your mom's aide as her servant could very well cause your mom's aide to re-consider her employment and this would cause your mom's health and safety to be at risk.\n\nBoth your mom and sister need to be made aware of this risk.", "I'm going to speak with mom before it happens again. I'll use many of reasonable comments made.", "She is a rude piece of work. NTA.", "NTA. She should at least compensate the woman BUT even that is wrong. I'd have a talk with the aid and advise her to get a lock next time your sister comes. And seeing some comments below...may be illegal. Please look that up to determine how much of a bill to send your sister. Or report her.", "That\u2019s a option", "NTA... this woman has a bedroom that is hers. Your sister is being an AH by using her bedroom. Entitled and selfish.", "Does she have a lock for her bedroom door? If not, you should have one installed and only you and the live-in worker should have keys. Let her know that she must not give the key to your sister. And let your sister know that she will not be allowed to have a key.", "That's not a good attitude. You don't actually give a shit either. I had to read all the way to the bottom to figure it out and there it is. Inconvenience? Hijacking a person's personal living space while breaking a contract is NOT an inconvenience. You are an asshole, just like your family. Poor caregiver. But who cares about her because she should be grateful for the opportunity you afford her. OP is a fucking saint."]}
