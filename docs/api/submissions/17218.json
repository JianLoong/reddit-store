In fact, if part of the Live-In Aid's employment package includes a free room, what you sister is doing could actually be illegal. I don't know about Florida Laws, but where I live and formerly managed 30 employees who supported people with disabilities, part of these arrangements REQUIRED the Aid had private room that was not accessible to other people.\n\nExample: Many live in homes provided respite every other weekend. The respite worker was NOT allowed to enter the live-in's room.", "NTA- next time you stay with her kick her out of her room see how she feels then", "Nta your sister is being incredibly invasive. This aid is moved in to take care of your mother and your sister is being rude as hell by kicking her out of her room when she visits.", "NTA and I agree with you 100%", "NTA. Your sister is being pretty disrespectful.", "NTA your sister shouldn\u2019t do that. She\u2019s displacing this aid. It\u2019s her home too. I\u2019m sure room and board are part of her compensation. Tell your sister there could be legal ramifications that can affect your mother financially.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Where I live, this would be a VERY costly mistake, especially if Aid is not being paid hourly for her time when sleeping.
