There is a restaurant there that is closed for weddings. About 20 minutes before I am about to walk down the aisle I\u2019m anxiously looking out the window at all my guests who are seated talking amongst themselves (I\u2019m upstairs looking out the window and they can\u2019t see me)\n\nThen I see a limousine pull up right where my guests are. I thought maybe my husbands groomsmen surprised him with a limo to arrive in because I didn\u2019t hire it. And then I see another bride get out. My guests all turn to her and look really confused because it\u2019s not me.  Turns out that bride hired the venue for photos that morning before I arrived, she was meant to be there before her own wedding at another close by venue. She hired the venue for 1 hour from 8am to 9am. It was now 3pm. \n\nI was really upset because my whole family was there and saw her before me. I wanted to be the only bride my family, especially my dad, saw that day. Or at least the first bride they saw!! \n\nI didn\u2019t cause a scene but I cried and I got my bridesmaids to get her to leave. Which she refused to do until she got a few photos\u2026 it didn\u2019t ruin my wedding, I forgot about it as soon as I saw my groom at the aisle. But it was not what I needed just before I walk down the aisle. \n\nWhen telling the story my co worker thought it wasn\u2019t nice I made her leave and even said it would have been a good photo op for the both of us to have a photo together. And she felt sad the other bride didn\u2019t get all the photos she wanted. \n\nThere was very clearly a wedding going on. If I were that bride I would have left when I saw there was another wedding. I was very chill about everything else that went wrong, and a lot of things did, my original wedding venue closed down 10 weeks before and I had to re so my whole wedding at this new place which worked out well. but this really upset me. AITA for making the other bride leave?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nI gotta go to bed I\u2019m in Australia and it\u2019s super late. just to add yes the venue handled this so bad BUT they were incredible in every other way other than this bizarre incident. As stated in my post had to re do my whole wedding at this new venue in 10 weeks due to my original venue closing. Like they went so above and beyond for me in that time helping me decorate and letting me use their own personal things from their farm for the wedding, so I don\u2019t want to sue anyone or leave any bad reviews. The original venue though have re opened since and yes I will leave them a terrible review they fucked me oner BAD but that\u2019s a whole other post. I will sleep well knowing so far the majority don\u2019t think I\u2019m a total AH.

Because you didn't know why she was there, how long she would be there or any other details, of course you were upset. Sure in hindsight, if you knew her story/been prepared, you could have had a cute moment and been friendly, but you didn't know what was happening. And clearly she isn't that nice of a person to show up 7 hours late to an appointment and also refuse to leave. \n\nAnd like you said, it didn't ruin your wedding, and good for you for that attitude. It was an upsetting (not soul crushing, just jarring, which I get) moment, you handled it, you moved on. \n\nAnd as for your coworker...sad for that bride? Who showed up hours late and wasn't even polite about her disruption? No need to feel sorry for her.", "Absolutely NTA. She was 6-7 hours late for her booking and had no right to crash your wedding, even if that wasn't her intention, she should have been more courteous and left when she realised there was a wedding happening. Totally understandable for you to be upset about that and ask her to leave. It doesn't sound you caused a scene either, so I fail to see how in any way you're TA.\n\nAlso regarding what your co-worker said:\n> it would have been a good photo op for the both of us to have a photo together.\n\nThis is hilarious to me. Like, I might be missing context, but that seems like a bizarre thing for your co-worker to suggest. I mean, it seems extremely unlikely to me that anyone would want to do a photo-op with an uninvited stranger (who came dressed in a bride's dress, of all things) at their own wedding.", "NTA  you booked a venue for your wedding, the venue then also booked someone else in the morning who failed to show up.  They should have told her to leave immediately.", "I'm not hugely bothered about weddings and wasn't hugely precious about my own, but if someone had been trying to have photos taken when my wedding was supposed to be happening I would have been furious. I think you wanting to be the \"only bride your family saw\" is fairly silly, but I'd still say NTA because of the disruption and inconvenience this caused people.", "NTA", "NTA", "She turned up a day late to her photo shoot when someone else's wedding was on. So NTA. She should have left.", "Um... \n\nYou have a marriage, the other bride wanted photos to illustrate a perfect 'wedding'' and showed up late.\n\nI think you're good, lol.", "NTA. \n\nI think of this as a distinction between what would be *great* and what is *fine*. The coworker thinks it'd be great if you were able to laugh about the error and get a *brides* picture. They are thinking in terms of handling the other person's error with unexpected grace. \n\nHowever, offering that grace should not be compelled or expected. The other bride missed their appointment. They should have recognized that they were crashing another event and been *entirely apologetic and flexible* about what they're doing. It is fine for you to ask that the other bride leave and to be frustrated when she doesn't.", "NTA you spent so much time planning and paid for the wedding. The other bride was completely selfish and rude. They should\u2019ve picked another spot for photos \nOR dress up again and have your portraits taken another day", "NTA, who is that other bride to be showing up 7 hours after the time she booked and acting surprised that it's now in use?", "Sweetheart, I would have been on this intrusive bride with an entire bottle of red wine! You should have invited me. \ud83d\ude18\nNYA", "NTA! The venue was contracted for your party and she was trespassing. She missed her scheduled time by MANY hours and purposely disrupted your time. She could have easily gone back for pictures after her own wedding. Your coworker is apparently a pushover.", "I\u2019m gonna go out in a limb and say no one gives a fuck if there\u2019s another bride anywhere nearby on the day. ESH. The venue owner for not stopping this clash in the first place, the other bride for thinking it\u2019s okay to show up like 6 hours late for her photos and then even more so when realising another wedding is there, and the OG bride for literally upsetting herself over not being the only bride on the day.", "INFO Where was she taking pictures? Are we talking like at the altar, in the middle of all your guests, or just in another area or in front of the venue? If its the first one, then absolutely YIKES.", "For real. Imagine booking a table at a restaurant for 5pm, then showing up at 8pm when another larger party had arrived and you just demanded you borrow their table.\n\nIt's also so weird to me like, yeah you took photos but aren't you going to look back at them be like \"oh yeah this wasn't my wedding btw. I hijacked someone else's 7 hours after my own\" like if there's decorations and such wouldn't it be OPs? Any people in the background would be OPs guests? It's so weird. Surely no venue is that special you gotta leave your own wedding reception in a limo just to go back and take pictures.", "NTA\n\nThe venue might have also told her there was a at that time so she couldn\u2019t do it then. She could\u2019ve planned this", "I don\u2019t think she had any intention of being there at 8 am. What bride is ready with their hair, makeup, and dress ready to go by 8am on their wedding day.", "NTA - you paid for a private venue during certain hours, as did she.", "Thank you for reminding me of a story about attention grabbing brides: about 10 or so years ago when I was still playing rugby, my club had a match on a pitch in the DC area, at a spot on the Potomac River (for the DMV folks, it was at Gravelly Point right next to National Airport). I was playing fullback, which is basically the last line of defense. About 50 or so yards away from me there was a wedding party taking pictures. All of a sudden I hear a bunch of yelling at me. I turn around to see the photographer walking up.\n\nPhotographer: \"Can your team take pictures with the wedding party?\"\n\nMe: \"Are you kidding me? No\"\n\nBride (who is now walking up): \"But it's my wedding, it'll be fun!\"\n\nMe (in full rugby \"do not fuck with me\" mode): \"WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SANCTIONED MATCH AND I WILL NOT HAVE THE REF STOP IT JUST SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME PHOTO OP\"\n\nMy coach, who is walking down the sideline towards me because she sees me being distracted by these idiots: \"jbnova6, what's going on?\"\n\nMe: \"Can you tell this bride to fuck off?\"\n\nCoach told the bride to fuck off, I went back to playing.", "Thank you! Yes I agree, the venue owner just comforted me whilst my friends handled it", "agree with you.", "And I've just added to my planning file ( as our friends and family's usual fall back matron of honor) a plan on how to handle a situation like this in case it ever happens. Just when you think there's nothing else that could possibly go wrong at a wedding, you learn something new.\n\nThat other bride was a total asshole. And I'd bet with such an entitled attitude she's already divorced by now. What a jerk.", "To add to this, the other bride was supposed to be there from 8am to 9pm.  She showed up at 3pm, **7 HOURS LATE**. She had no right to be there at that time.\n\nOP is definitely NTA, and I agree, the venue *should* have handled it.", "Pretty selfish and rude.", "10/10", "Lmao apparently she isn\u2019t alone in her opinion. I accept some people think it\u2019s an AH move. It\u2019s just a funny story for me to tell now", "For real. I can't get over the suggestion that OP should have done photos with the crasher. Why tf would OP want to do wedding photos with a complete stranger?", "Aw thank you!! Honestly so much went wrong in the lead up that it\u2019s comical. It was just the worst luck. It\u2019s a funny story for me to tell now, it\u2019s all part of the story as my MIL said.  It was a beautiful day in the end \ud83e\udd70", "Yeah, this is definitely a venue problem. OP and her party shouldn\u2019t have had to be involved at all.", "NTA - you paid for a private venue during certain hours, as did she.", "I like her :(", "Ty \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah and who books a photo shoot at 8am.. I guess morning weddings are a thing but idk seems weird.", "Was it on a wedding subreddit? I told the story on there before.", "Aw thank you \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72", "I know, right? Oh no, another girl is a wedding gown showed up outside to take photos. The horror! People really do need to grow up.", "... she paid to rent a venue and is an ahole for expecting to use it alone because other people exist? This wild to me, lol. \n\n\nLike... if you rent a boat, anyone can just jump on it and chill out for a bit as they exist? \n\n\nThis was not a public park. This was a privat event that was about to start. The groom was arriving at any minute and gretting the guests. If not told to leave, the other brider would've still be there as op planned to go down the isle... or did you expect op to wait for the other bride?", "But the bride for the wedding that's going on is entitled to be the main character. Someone getting married at a completely different venue is TA for crashing another person's wedding.", "the bride spent a lot of money to rent a space for a private event. This other person rented it for an hour in the morning, didn't show up, but instead showed up while another event was going on. \n\nThat's like if I rented a car for a lot of money to drive somewhere specific and a random stranger just gets in to use it himself. I know other people exist, but if I pay money to have a private event somewhere, I expect it to be private.", "She paid the venue to be the main character for a period of time. Both of them may've been under that impression, but the OP was correct in hers.", "The OP and her husband are the main characters on that day for that venue. They paid for it.", "The venue was reserved. The wedding crasher did not have the place booked at the time - erego, no right to be there. When you reserve a private place for a private event, strangers do not have a right to enter without your permission.", "... not on the same day... at the same wedding... she wanted to be the only bride at her own wedding...\n\n\ndon't act like this was not an on going event op paid a lot of money for.", "Not existed, but showed up to a private venue and then refused to leave when asked.  A bit different. OP NTA for wanting to have the wedding that she wants. If the other bride had any time management skills she could've taken all the pictures she wanted....at the time she booked, not 7 hours later.", "But OP booked the venue first... If you pay a lot of money for a reservation at a restaurant how would you feel if a stranger showed up and interrupted your special event by inserting themselves at your table between you and your family? It's weird and rude. I doubt this story is real but NTA for being upset by this.", "I see where you are coming from but 20 minutes before you walk down the aisle is a very emotional time haha. I cried privately upstairs, I didn\u2019t run out and yell at her or anything, that\u2019s what I meant by not causing a scene. If it was after my ceremony I would have felt better about her using my venue for photos, but let me have my moment first you know.", "That AH has booked the venue for the morning. It's not the OP's problem she was 6 hours late. Someone from the venue should have booted her out.", "I think that OP paid a lot of money for a private venue. She isn't upset someone else existed on her wedding day, she's upset someone else showed up and wanted to use the venue she had spent good money for. \n\nThat's like paying a lot of money to rent a boat and then some stranger just jumps on it and chills on it, too, and you're like \"well, I can't be mad you exist on the same day I rented this boat, go ahead\".", "I think you missed the part where the other bride was 6 hours late to the venue for her photos (aka they weren't supposed to be there at the same time).", "This !!!!", "Someone crashed her wedding. The venue wasn't double booked, the crasher showed up hours after her booked slot. Anybody would be pissed at someone trying to do that. Ex. I booked a grove at the park for my mom's funeral reception - if someone showed up and tried to use the grove for photis, I'd have been pissed. Same if an uninvited stranger had come during the many times we had groves booked for graduations and refused to leave upon being told it was reserved.", "It cost her the money she paid for exclusive use of a private venue, what the hell are you talking about lol", ">nobody cares that a woman showed up with a white dress.\n\n\nOp cared\nHer bridesmaids cared\nHer family cared\nThe guests cared\nThe owner of the venue cared\nAnd that other bride did not because for her it was ME ME ME after missing her appointment.\n\nThat was a rude and a very unnecessary stress for the bride.", "I don't know how to do the quote thing. But that hypothetical situation about booking tables in a restaurant... I work in the restaurant of a hotel. That exact situation happened last week. Table of two booked for  5.30pm, showed up at 9pm when we'd put that table with another to make a 10 top.  So that kind of thing actually happens.\n \nHospitality is great... /s", "That made me laugh hahaha. They didn\u2019t take photos with my guests in the background but that would be hilarious.  They took the photos against trees and flowers and stuff. Trying to hide the fact they are at someone else\u2019s wedding \ud83d\ude05 tbh she may as well have just walked down my aisle and warmed it up for me", "And the venue needed to boot her as soon as she rolled up.", "Even the brunch/morning weddings I've seen start at like 10 or 11, meaning the bride likely isn't ready until like 9:30 at the earliest.", "Make sure to include the entire story (including the venue owner's lack of action) when you leave a review of the venue on wedding wire and google and other places.", "The venue owner should have handled it.", "Why didn\u2019t the venue owner tell her to leave? Don\u2019t they own the venue???", "Ask the venue for a partial refund. You paid for the event to be exclusively your for the time of your wedding.

If they refuse then write an honest review letting other brides know of the potential problems they could have with other brides on their big day.", "One of your friends should have thrown a glass of wine at her. As she showed up pretty much as you were about to walk down the aisle I think she was acting trashy, so NTA", "I can't relate to what you felt, I can't put myself in your shoes...and yet it's clear to me that you're NTA.\n\nETA: I don't mean that to dismiss how you felt, just that it's totally outside my experience.", "I think comment about the photo op was completely unnecessary and was definitely said to rile you up. Be careful around her.", "She showed you what she thinks of you. When people show you who they really are, believe them.", "Please take this as a warning: you can meet some amazing people through work, I met my husband through a job but there is also a lot of people in the workplace that will be really friendly with you until it no longer benefits them and they will throw you under the bus the second they get the chance. Be very careful about what you say to work colleagues. I learned the hard way.", "I bet the venue gave her no other option. Most weddings don't start till at least around 10am. The morning prep is typically a few hours.", "Yes", "Yeah this is kinda my main irk, if it was a public place then yeah ok but I paid thousands of dollars to hire the venue. Also if I had already had my ceremony I would have felt better letting her use it, but I hadn\u2019t even had my moment yet.", "The other bride is *also* the asshole for showing up 6 hours late. During another wedding. \n\n>I was really upset because my whole family was there and saw her before me. I wanted to be the only bride my family, especially my dad, saw that day. Or at least the first bride they saw!! \n\nBut this is silly.", "Thank u! I\u2019m not usually one who wants all eyes on me. I\u2019m very self conscious. This was the first time in my life I wanted it that way.", "Yeah. It\u2019s not like OP was having a pop up wedding on a public beach or something. She reserved and paid for a private venue. That\u2019s why the phrase \u201csecuring a venue\u201d exists. I understand shit happens but the venue could have at least approached the bride and explained the situation. She might have been less startled if it wasn\u2019t a complete surprise. That being said, she was paying for that time so it still would have been within her rights to decline. We don\u2019t know what could have possibly happened to cause the other bride to miss her appointment, but it really shouldn\u2019t have been on OP to deal with.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Sorry. Not this.", "I didn't say she shouldn't have been upset. But seriously, being this angry right now for something that ended up not ruining anything is taking it too far. About the whole wedding, how happy she must have been, and all she talks to her coworker about is how annoyed she was about a few minutes interruption before the ceremony had even started !? That's what I have a problem with op. And still, she was upset not because the bride wanted to take some photos, but because she wanted to be the only bride on that day... her guests couldn't have cared less about a dumbass that came before the ceremony even started.

As I said in the end of my post, my original venue shut down right before my wedding and I had to re do the whole thing and she helped me so much in such a short time. The old venue had all decor included so I had nothing.

I\u2019ve had friends get married on large estates - think of, like, a country ranch property with tons of land. So, I could *maybe* understand if the other bride and her party were going to be *very* distanced AND you had been forewarned or perhaps even asked for permission. It sounds like your venue was pretty intimate. Not appropriate at all. I agree, the owner should have told the other bride that she could not show up hours late for photos because there was another event occurring. I\u2019m sorry this happened. It was tacky, rude and unfair.", "They're asking a simple question. If you think that OP is an A, who was she an A towards?"]}
