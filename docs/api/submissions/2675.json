Some people don\u2019t know how to play with little kids. The kid wasn\u2019t being neglected or put in danger. Tell the BIL to stop attempting to play with the kid in the future.", "Other way around, OP might say she wants the BIL cut out of their lives. This entire sub has a tendency to go nuclear on everything, including the stuff that doesn\u2019t call for it. There\u2019s cases of abuse, cheating, neglect, etc that all call for the nuclear option. Not realizing how to play with a 2 year old one time and making her cry one time is not that. Maybe everyone\u2019s going to think I\u2019m crazy I guess.", "Yes, because \"that's just what uncles do!\" isn't a good excuse. My point is that I hate my uncles *because* they pulled this shit on me my entire childhood.", "Oof", "Nah. I just don't think it's applicable in this specific situation.", "So at what age in your opinion are children allowed to complain when bullies take their stuff away?", "Teasing is playful, this stopped being playful when OP asked him to stop and he refused.", "He went out of his way to torment a 2 year old, and caused her to cry. What's NOT malicious about that?", "That sounds like a typical bully answer, if the victim does not find it funny it is not teasing and it is not funny.", "I think purposely making a child cry is an AH move and unnecessary. Teasing and joking cross into bullying when you are purposely making someone else (even a toddler) cry. If he can't figure out a way to interact with a child without purposely making them cry, then maybe he needs to figure out what's wrong with himself.", "\"That's my teddy bear! I don't know you!\"\n\n\n*Nutcracker Suite in AAAAAGH minor ensues*", "You clearly don't care about or understand child development and child psychology, and that's fine. But let's not pretend that crossing boundaries is fine just because the person whose boundaries are being crossed is a toddler.", "Do you think everyone who posts on this sub is part of a hive mind? Just because you've seen people react that way doesn't mean OP is going to.", "I was saying that uncle's joke around. He just went to far and didn't own up to it, that's something you should do but he didn't. That's what I was getting at.", "\"Didn't own up to it\" - you mean he lied?", "\"you mean he lied\" - you mean you know what I mean when I said he didn't own up and I hope you under stand how silly quoting people like this to prove some sort of point is. \n\nAlso, jester, buddy, go to therapy because I have a feeling you have some strong anger towards your uncle's. And therapy is the answer, allegedly.", "lmao what", "Therapy. That's the answer to this argument.", "So you think everyone who disagrees with you needs therapy? Yeah, that's rational."]}
