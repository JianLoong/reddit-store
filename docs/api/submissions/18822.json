I wouldn\u2019t invite her, because at the end if the day it\u2019s YOUR house and if they make you feel uncomfortable, kick their asses to the curb! I\u2019m so tired of family talking about family like that, as if they have any valid argument over what they said? It\u2019s demeaning, untrustworthy, and outright rude. When family talks about other family like this, 99% of the time they have said other horrible things too.

Expect family day location to be changed though.", "YTA. You overheard a conversation that wasn't meant for your ears. Now you want to exclude her-- and by proxy, your brother? You are going to cut off 'an amazing SIL/auntie' over a couple comments she believed were private? Let your SIL deal with her own misgivings by venting to her mom; not everyone needs to tell everyone else their most honest thoughts. She's trying and making an effort to get along without challenging you to your face, which shows she's a bit more mature, even if I totally disagree with her stance on vaccines.", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn't have talked behind your back to her mother even though it's her choice and you shouldn't have entered the house with permission or at least giving notice that you were coming over. \n\nYour husband is right, she did talk to her mother in confidence because you made it unaware you were even there at their house.", "YTA, none of that was said to you directly and unless you're giving her control over your kids medical decisions really shouldn't matter.

From her perspective it's harmful to your children. She voiced this privately to her mum. This (or something else) makes her feel uncomfortable around you. I honestly don't see anything wrong with this. It's very likely that she wouldn't have said any of this to your face, because she values having you and her kids in your life MORE than the opinions you overheard. I'm not in the US, but the divisiveness over vaccination is on a level that is quite shocking.\n\nYour perspective is that vaccinations save lives. Where I'm from it's okay to have a different opinion to someone else and still be friends. I recommend that you aim for this. It would be unnecessarily dramatic to lose the relationship with your brother and SiL over this. Talk to them both (rationally) about your feelings of betrayal and hurt, albeit that none of what was said was meant for your ears, (big lesson for you here about knocking when entering). Then, listen to her explain why she said what she said, and hopefully why she would never have said it to your face because it wouldn't have been worth hurting you over it.", "NTA she's the one putting her kids at risk, she's bashing you for being sensible.", "NTA.

If I ever have kids, I would want them and all the kids around then vaccinated, and yes, I would end an association over it.", "NTA.

Maybe she recognizes her discomfort is her own thing to deal with and doesn't need to tell OP about it because they just don't have that sort of relationship.
