Maybe it's a cultural or regional thing. Where I grew up it's super common for people in your inner circle to just drop in. It's a practice not without its problems though as you can see. I once walked in on my ex-bf's mom giving his dad a beej in his lazyboy. Noped out and voluntarily rescinded my open door policy there.", "Huh. Interesting. You see, in the US people who refuse to vaccinate are largely considered to be ridiculous because that stance goes against all credible scientific data. The original study that started the whole wave of vaccine skepticism is globally considered junk science. No one could replicate it, and investigations into the matter, which included witnesses, found that the lead, Andrew Wakefield, fabricated data. Even most of the co-authors on the paper disassociated themselves from it. Oh, and here\u2019s the real fun part. He was trying/planning (don\u2019t remember) to make tens of millions of dollars by selling autism test kits based on his bogus science. The General Medical Council in your country had some really scathing things to say about him, including that he acted against the interests of his patients, which has been the foundation of medicine since Hammurabi. In the US it was former playboy bunny Jenny Mcarthy that popularized the antivaccine stance.\n\nHere, the people who listen to a playboy bunny and a globally disgraced physician who lost his medical license and don\u2019t vaccinate their kids tend to harbor beliefs in ridiculous conspiracy theories like believing the earth is flat, that democrats run a child sex ring out of a D.C. pizzeria, or that Obama is the antichrist. They\u2019re often the people who take horse dewormer to treat Covid and the people who think the government has implanted tracking devices into people\u2019s brains. \n\nDemographically, skeptics are not entirely, but predominantly conservative and republican, so it\u2019s partially a political thing here. In fact, once the Covid vaccine was made available in the US, the demographics of those who died changed, and were overwhelmingly republicans, the unofficial party of vaccine skepticism. It was so extreme that the New York Times called it \u201cRed Covid.\u201d \n\nNYT worked with social scientists to figure out WHY skeptics ignore the mountains of evidence, and it was their conclusion that no amount of data will sway them because it ultimately just comes down to \u201cgut beliefs.\u201d \nThese skeptics share certain traits across countries and cultures. They have a \u201csensitivity for liberty,\u201d reject authority, and like to try to exert more control in their lives. It\u2019s a moral choice for them. They also tend to attach themselves to conspiracy theories to provide comfort in the midst of and explanations for hardships in their lives. \n\nAnd now, because vaccine numbers are going down, herd immunity is threatened here. According to the CDC, measles, mumps, whooping cough, and chicken pox are coming back. These diseases kill far more children than vaccines. Some of those children will die because they were too young to be vaccinated, and someone in their sphere didn\u2019t want to be told what to do. \n\nIf I insist, despite all evidence, that alcohol consumption does not impair mental capabilities, and I get in the car drunk, cause an accident, and kill someone dear to you, how might you feel? Would you still say, well hold on, the Tiger King and Dr. Oz said so.? That checks out. And also I FEEL I\u2019m right.\n\nThat\u2019s why vaccines are \u201cdivisive\u201d here.", "I will point out it depends on the vaccination because a lot of them for most people are fine for the rest of their life. You can actually get blood work done to check to see if you're still doing okay I only know this because i just got the blood work done a couple months back before I started biologics for my chronic illness. We needed to know if I need to get updated on any and I'm still good and I'm in my 30s.now there are some that no matter what you need to get updated like tetanus.", "Forget who I heard make this argument first, but they were right so I've stolen it:\n\nEven if I actually believed vaccines caused autism...I would rather give my kid that vaccine and have them be ASD for life than have them get polio or measles or something that would leave them neurotypical & dead.  \n\nVaccines Save Lives and the Awesomest people I know are Autistic \ud83d\udc99", "My mother gave me a vaccine in the womb, that\u2019s how I got autism. /s", "Idk but about others but personally I'd rather be vaccinated against like every possible disease ever and have autism than be dead.", "it's even better because autism isn't just 1 condition, it's a spectrum. there is not 1 form of autism that's 'you have autism, so this is how you are'. the person with autism who is 24 years old but functions on a level of a 3 year old does not have 'the same' autism as someone who is diagnosed but completely functional in society, yet they'll both have autism. in its base it's a sensory processing disorder, but the how and the why and the where did it come from and how does it affect someone can be so wildly different from case to case. it's kinda like saying vaccines cause a runny nose, but is it a flu runny nose? a sniffy common cold kinda runny nose? a mild hayfever runny nose? a debilitating i can barely breathe runny nose?", "While I fully agree with the sentiment, I\u2019ve also worked with people who are very low functioning with autism. \n\nThe autism community has done an awesome job normalizing it over the past decade, and a lot more people are aware of and accepting of people with autism. That\u2019s great! But it\u2019s also completely left out people who are severely affected.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like saying COVID is \u201cjust a cold.\u201d Yeah. For a lot of people, the symptoms are mild and just make you miserable for a few days, if that. But there are a lot of people who are much more severely affected. \n\nWith autism we see people who will never talk, or hold a job, or have meaningful relationships even with their families. People who can\u2019t walk into a grocery store or restaurant because of overstimulation. Adults who are unable to dress or bathe themselves. Who will need caregivers for the rest of their lives.", "There was an anti vaxer that tweeted out something stupid about what did people in the past do, implying because they didn\u2019t have them in the past and the human race is still here we don\u2019t need vaccines. \n\nThe response I saw was pure gold: \u201cthey died you uneducated potato\u201d", "They don\u2019t get that - because the diseases are no longer prevalent.

If there is no organic cause identified, it\u2019s a mysterious lump of behavior that gets a name if it matches other people with the same cluster of behaviors.

My parents were so shocked when I was about 8 and hearing this family story *again* at a get together said \u2018well, nature did take its course.

I spent two months in hospital in the first year of my life with meningitis. Mumps was horrific. Chicken pox was boring. But each of these I was a sick child suffering and I have zero interest in people whose beliefs are \u2018I don\u2019t like it so I\u2019ll let someone else experience the pain, symptoms and misery while I complain.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m now immune compromised and react like hell to vaccines and am even more dependent on herd immunity.

Muh rights.\u2019 Congrats. You are still like my family saying \u2018dead is better than disabled and frankly life is expendable.

Not just \u2018oh let\u2019s not anti bac everything normal human life dirt\u2019 but filthy houses, animals on surfaces, no hand washing and slovenly is to me as incomptible on our core values as their attitude to life and health.
