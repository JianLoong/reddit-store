If anything, you saved Bob the years and expense of schooling for a field he is clearly not suited to join.", "NTA. Bob is wholly responsible for his own actions and you\u2019re right\u2014he should not have been a doctor. He abused his access to veritably spy on his friends and others and then probably blabbed about that sensitive information. I would have felt so violated.", "NTA !", "Absolutely not NTA\n\nBob has no business having access to anyone's personal business. Hopefully this teaches him to not be nosy, not be braggy, and not be dumb enough to tell on himself like that.", "NTA by any account.   \n\n>  He said he could get in trouble for doing it, but he didn\u2019t think the clinic noticed.\n\nWhether the clinic noticed is irrelevant. Bob knew it was a violation of patient privacy, and of HIPAA. \"Curiosity\" is not a valid reason to view Protected Health Information.\n\nBob clearly has no respect for the privacy of his future potential patients and should not be trusted as a physician.\n\nYou did him (and all the potential patients whose privacy he would have violated) a favor.", "NTA\n\nThat's a serious violation. You did the right thing.\n\nAll access to all records are logged by the systems, BUT they may or may not know access by Bob is unusual, but they can definitely tell when they were accessed and by who. The more details make it easier to search the logs.", "NTA. He brought this on himself.", "NTA at all. In the healthcare offices I've worked in, every keystroke is monitored, & it's a huge issue if they find you accessing the chart of a patient you are not involved in either treatment or billing. I'd do the same thing.", "NTA. \n\nThe admin was right. It was only a matter of time before Bob got caught for that or something worse. Better for it to happen early in order to minimize damage. I hope integrity isn't as vital to his next career .", "NTA, although I'm surprised none of you called him out on it when he told you all. Like, that's not ok. Stand up for your morals publicly.", "NTA. I totally understand why you feel bad but what he did was ethically wrong and probably shouldn\u2019t have access to records like that.", "NTA. \n\nI work in healthcare. This is like the number one thing not to do - and everyone knows it. Better it be caught now then Bob goes through 4+ years of schooling and hundreds of thousands of dollars just to be fired and un-hireable the second he can\u2019t help but look up the chart of a friend, family, or celeb who visits his institution.", "Dedineatly NTA. He violated the rules and then violated your integrity when he told you. By telling you, he has now included you in breaking the rules as well.

I worked in a hospital lab and one of things they emphasized during training is that you aren't allowed to look up patient information randomly, or access your own results if you are a patient yourself (or family).

You made the right call.", "Thank you for your input and reassurance.\n\nThis was a very stressful situation for me because I didn\u2019t want any of my friends to know and so I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it. I was so nervous about confessing Bob\u2019s name to our administration, but I could hear my mother\u2019s mantra \u201cdo the right thing\u201d echoing in my head and I felt strongly I was making the right choice. Thank you for affirming that.", "In that moment, I knew immediately that my most likely course of action was to report him. Had I chastised him, everyone would\u2019ve known it was me who snitched. I think my friends ultimately would\u2019ve sided with me, but I wanted to keep the peace and not fragment my entire friend group. I was able to report him without doing that, and I\u2019m sure he understands now how fucked up his actions were. I understand your point though and I almost always do, I just chose not to in this situation.", "Never mind protecting Bob, his investment and his career.

You cannot access the records of anyone unless you are investigating them and if we get a case involving a family member or someone we know we have to inform management to get it reassigned.\n\nThere is just too high of a risk of abusing that access and information. As someone in heath care this risk is even greater and provides an even bigger risk of abusing someone's privacy.", "In addition to violating the law, he was stupid about it. This points to multiple lapses in judgement. Like he doesn\u2019t even understand how to cover his ass - that would have surely resulted in disaster for his patients and colleagues down the line. Hopefully he\u2019ll smarten up. Even if he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re NTA and that\u2019s a shitty situation he put you in. One more example of lack of consideration in his decisions. Woof.", "NTA. However, I think you should tell him it was you and your reasoning for why you decided to do so.", "Bob was wrong. Sounds like he deserves whatever repercussions he gets. But you said Bob was a friend of yours...  You potentially ended his career before it even started (I know it was his actions that got him in trouble, but you still ratted). I personally value my friends more than the privacy of strangers. Barring an imminent threat to someone, I would never rat on a friend like that. I would also never be friends with someone who would do that to a friend. EHS.", "NTA HIPAA is incredibly important. I worked as a social worker for a while (currently on break while attending grad school) and it was drilled into our heads that absolutely confidentiality had to be top priority. You're right that if he's like this now, he would likely make a similar mistake in the future, possibly accidently letting a patient's information slip and who knows what could happen", "NTA and stop calling yourself a snitch. Bob has no business in healthcare if he\u2019s already violating HIPAA and openly bragging about it. You didn\u2019t snitch, you did the morally right thing by reporting his actions BEFORE he \u201cgossiped\u201d about someone\u2019s private health records.", "NTA, and just to make you feel better, you alerting someone now and him changing his career path now, just saved all the time he would\u2019ve wasted later. Most systems track this information automatically now and will either flag unusual activity or they\u2019ll audit medical access to prevent incidents like this. In the day of technology, everything you do at work is tracked, and if you access records for a patient not directly assigned to you, you better have an extremely good reason for doing so, because there will be a paper trail, and those paper trails are routinely checked, because hospitals want to avoid the lawsuit before it happens, and don\u2019t just wait until there\u2019s an issue/complaint to investigate usually. It\u2019s an exceptionally simple code to write to have a database of physician\u2019s patients and a database of records accessed and to mark any that don\u2019t overlap. \n\nSo, really, you did a nice thing! He would\u2019ve been fired, shamed, and sued eventually.

You did the right thing!", "NTA. And Epic could definitely track that. You have saved him hundreds of thousands of dollars because he\u2019s a gossip that can\u2019t keep his eyes to himself.", "NTA at all. HIPAA exists for this very reason. I work in healthcare and everyone knows the consequence of violating HIPAA is losing your career. Bob wants to be a doctor but he isn\u2019t smart enough to assess the risk? Yikes.", "Epic is very good about tracking who gets into what chart so bob wouldn\u2019t have been undiscovered long.", "Omg, my jaw dropped reading Bob had accessed medical records he had no NEED to in the course of his volunteer work, which is a huge HIPAA violation. OP was certainly justified in feeling the way they did about the possibility of Bob accessing their information without permission and need. \n\nOP, you 1 million percent did the right thing in reporting the violation. I used to work in patient accounts in medical billing and it was the # 1 rule to never violate HIPAA. The fact that Bob didn't stop himself from doing it nor kept the fact he violated HIPAA to himself are 2 huge red flags. He was probably talked to and advised not to continue in pursuing a medical career. He obviously cannot abide by the most basic rules and would end up doing more harm than good. Please stop feeling guilty about this. Bob made the choices and this is the consequence of those actions.", "You protected not only his future patients but probably anyone he might come in contact with including future partners. \n\nEven if he hadn't disclosed thecontents of their medical records to anyone, he has no business knowing their private information, and the laws are there so that people feel safe in approaching a medical professional - people who don't feel safe will often avoid seeking medical advice and treatment. His actions were appalling in many ways.", "It's very worrying that your admin  talked about \"snitching\" and covered the whole thing up. You should inform the clinic that he worked at, formally and in writing. It's their patients that are affected and they have a duty of care to them. Those patients also should be informed that their records have been compromised. The clinic may also need to review their practices and security (like not giving such access to such sensitive data to volunteers). \n\nThis isn't \"snitching\", it's whistleblowing. Whistleblowers deserve protection, they are doing a service to their communities.", "If u don\u2019t think u did anything wrong you should tell the truth otherwise your just lying to your self because if you want to stay friends with bob even if you know he wouldn\u2019t want to be friends after this you shouldn\u2019t have reported him", "Lets go over the fact:\n\n1) Bob knew this is a lose-your-job violation. \n2) He still proceeded, not once or twice but many, many times. \n3) Likely he could not look up everyone at once so he did this on several different occassions too. \n4) He thinks it is a joke and laughs it off in front of friends whom are likely victims too (absolutely idiotic really). \n\nYeah, this is not an oops-I-peeked-but-I-will-never-do-it again situation. His care for the severity of it is zero. That is very concerning!\n\nThen the school found out. If it was just one peek, he would probably have gotten away with a warning. The fact that he was probably told that he could walk out or get kicked out tells me that there was a LOT to uncover once they started digging a bit. \n\nNTA. He would have done it again and again with zero remorse or understanding of the damage he is doing.", "NTA\n\nI work in a healthcare setting and I cannot stress enough how very clearly and often we are reminded not to do this. I have yearly compliance training on it. It comes up as a reminder every few team meetings.

What Bob didn't is horrible. He should not have any access to personal records. I'm a horrified that a volunteer can access these records.", "You did the right thing *and you know it.* Do NOT second guess yourself.\nNTA.", "NTA. he violated privacy rules set in place to protect patients from privacy violations by untrustworthy individuals.", "Well, you're not his friend.\n\nIt basically comes down to what you want out of this.  If you think you should be able to lie and keep his friendship, then yes you would be a gaping asshole.  Integrity for thee but not for me.\n\nIf you come clean to him and suffer the consequences for your principled stand, then you're not an asshole - just a hard-ass.  That's okay, I'm a hard-ass too when it comes to ethics violations.\n\nSo, which is it?  INFO", "Unpopular but YTA. You\u2019re 100% not Bobs friend. And you don\u2019t even know that he told anyone, you assumed that.\n\nReddit is telling you you\u2019re right but best believe in real life people would think you were a major snitch for doing that to someone.", "I'd also be very surprised if they hadn't noticed already. A lot of hospital systems log whose accounts go into what patient records and will automatically flag ROI/MPI if there's an unauthorized access, some won't even let you access them anymore unless you as a physician are linked in the system to that patient. At the very least, following OP's complaint they were easily able to see the dude accessed EHRs he wasn't supposed to be. Probably got the fear of god put into him and was only allowed to switch careers for threat of never working in health care again if he didn't.", "I think you are especially not the asshole because in that moment he told you he did this to other friends and you had him looked into for looking at your records which he never disclosed. That and considering he is bragging about it, forget it, he did it to himself.", "Snitching wasn't the admin's words, it was the OP's. OP was just paraphrasing using their own words.\n\nAnd in regards to \"covering up\", the admin made the deal he needed to make with OP to convince OP to give the name so they could address it. They knew someone violated HIPAA, they just didn't know who. They could have threatened the full force of the law, not get any name because OP still cared about their friend, and friend would go on to become a doctor and continue violating people's confidentiality.\n\nOr they could have made some kind of compromise to get the name so they could put a stop to it and protect future patients, which they did, and also protected OP's identity. The admin did the right thing. And don't assume the clinic wasn't informed either or that the compromised patients weren't informed of the breach. That's detail that's outside of what OP would be aware of."]}
