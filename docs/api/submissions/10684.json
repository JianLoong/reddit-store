Bob is great, but loves to gossip. This is well known in our friend group, and Bob himself jokes that if you have a secret you want to keep, don\u2019t tell him because everyone will know. Besides this flaw, Bob is a good friend with wonderful qualities. I just avoid sharing sensitive information with him. \n\nBob did some volunteer work for a health clinic. My friends and I, including Bob, were hanging out one night. Bob told us how he had EPIC access as part of his role. While laughing, he said he looked up the health info of some of his high school friends. He said he could get in trouble for doing it, but he didn\u2019t think the clinic noticed.\n\nI was horrified by this confession, but frankly, not totally surprised. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time, nor did I make any indication of the fact that I was disgusted. \n\nFor a few days, I mulled over the situation. I realized that there was a 0.1% chance that Bob hadn\u2019t also looked up my chart as well. He likely told us his searches were restricted to his HS friends to not upset us. I had nothing to hide, but what if I did? I felt so violated. I also thought it was likely that Bob shared whatever he learned about people in his HS to his other HS friends.\n\nI also thought if Bob would do this, as an adult, he was not qualified/suited to be a doctor. Patient privacy is integral to the trust that patients have in their physicians. Bob knew that & still violated his friends\u2019 privacy & the law and then laughed about it.\n\nI wanted to figure out if Bob had looked up my chart. I called our HIPAA hotline, vaguely explained the situation, & asked if anyone unusual had accessed my chart. They said they couldn\u2019t tell me unless I gave them the name of the suspect. I declined, but I had already given them my name. I was contacted by an admin at my school who I am close with. He asked me to meet with him and I did. We discussed the situation (w/o names). He told me that if I gave him the name, he would never reveal that I was the snitch (not his words) & that the person wouldn\u2019t get in much trouble. I didn\u2019t place too much stock in the latter promise, but I agreed and told him the name bc I felt this was a serious matter. My admin also told me it was better for Bob to face the consequences now rather than later on as a physician where he could lose his license/be sued for millions. \n\nFast forward to now: I don\u2019t believe that Bob has any idea that I was the snitch. However, Bob has suddenly decided to switch career paths. I think that the two incidents are connected. I feel bad that Bob had to throw away his life plans, but I think this is for the best. Anyway, Bob is so smart that he will excel at any career. I\u2019ve never told a soul (besides the admin) about this & so I wonder if I am a monster for what I did. I think my friends would really be shocked & upset if I told them.\n\nSo, AITA for snitching on my friend?", "created_utc": 1677129850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119phkw/aita_for_snitching_on_my_hipaaviolating_friend/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, bury this knowledge/memory in a deep hole and dont tell.", "As a rape victim and child abuse survivor with trauma and mental health info in my medical records\u2014NTA.", "NTA. If anything, you saved Bob the years and expense of schooling for a field he is clearly not suited to join.", "NTA. Bob is wholly responsible for his own actions and you\u2019re right\u2014he should not have been a doctor. He abused his access to veritably spy on his friends and others and then probably blabbed about that sensitive information. I would have felt so violated.", "NTA !", "Absolutely not NTA\n\nBob has no business having access to anyone's personal business. Hopefully this teaches him to not be nosy, not be braggy, and not be dumb enough to tell on himself like that.", "NTA by any account.   \n\n>  He said he could get in trouble for doing it, but he didn\u2019t think the clinic noticed.\n\nWhether the clinic noticed is irrelevant. Bob knew it was a violation of patient privacy, and of HIPAA. \"Curiosity\" is not a valid reason to view Protected Health Information.\n\nBob clearly has no respect for the privacy of his future potential patients and should not be trusted as a physician.\n\nYou did him (and all the potential patients whose privacy he would haev violated) a favor.", "NTA\n\nThat's a serious violation. You did the right thing.\n\nAll access to all records are logged by the systems, BUT they may or may not know access by Bob is unusual, but they can definitely tell when they were accessed and by who. The more details make it easier to search the logs.", "NTA. He brought this on himself.", "NTA at all. In the healthcare offices I've worked in, every keystroke is monitored, & it's a huge issue if they find you accessing the chart of a patient you are not involved in either treatment or billing. I'd do the same thing.", "NTA. \n\nThe admin was right. It was only a matter of time before Bob got caught for that or something worse. Better for it to happen early in order to minimize damage. I hope integrity isn't as vital to his next career .", "NTA, although I'm surprised none of you called him out on it when he told you all. Like, that's not ok. Stand up for your morals publicly.", "NTA. I totally understand why you feel bad but what he did was ethically wrong and probably shouldn\u2019t have access to records like that.", "NTA. \n\nI work in healthcare. This is like the number one thing not to do - and everyone knows it. Better it be caught now then Bob goes through 4+ years of schooling and hundreds of thousands of dollars just to be fired and un-hireable the second he can\u2019t help but look up the chart of a friend, family, or celeb who visits his institution.", "Dedineatly NTA. He violated the rules and then violated your integrity when he told you. By telling you, he has now included you in breaking the rules as well. You have to protect yourself from being included in such behavior and others from being violated by this creep.

I worked in a hospital lab and one of things they emphasized during training is that you aren't allowed to look up patient information randomly, or access your own results if you are a patient yourself (or family). I always avoided looking up patient information unless I needed background info/other test results for a panel I was analyzing. \n\nWhat Bob did was a gross violation of patient privacy and massive misconduct. You made the right call.", "Thank you for your input and reassurance.\n\nThis was a very stressful situation for me because I didn\u2019t want any of my friends to know and so I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it. I was so nervous about confessing Bob\u2019s name to our administration, but I could hear my mother\u2019s mantra \u201cdo the right thing\u201d echoing in my head and I felt strongly I was making the right choice. Thank you for affirming that.", "In that moment, I knew immediately that my most likely course of action was to report him. Had I chastised him, everyone would\u2019ve known it was me who snitched. I think my friends ultimately would\u2019ve sided with me, but I wanted to keep the peace and not fragment my entire friend group. I was able to report him without doing that, and I\u2019m sure he understands now how fucked up his actions were. I understand your point though and I almost always do, I just chose not to in this situation.", "Never mind protecting Bob, his investment and his career. Any bad thing that would have happened he would have brought on himself. OP did the right thing by protecting Bob\u2019s future patients.", "Fwiw, anyone who would have supported Bob isn't anyone I would want as a friend. There is no place in my life for people like that."]}
