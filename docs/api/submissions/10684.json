Most systems track this information automatically now and will either flag unusual activity or they\u2019ll audit medical access to prevent incidents like this. In the day of technology, everything you do at work is tracked, and if you access records for a patient not directly assigned to you, you better have an extremely good reason for doing so, because there will be a paper trail, and those paper trails are routinely checked, because hospitals want to avoid the lawsuit before it happens, and don\u2019t just wait until there\u2019s an issue/complaint to investigate usually. It\u2019s an exceptionally simple code to write to have a database of physician\u2019s patients and a database of records accessed and to mark any that don\u2019t overlap. \n\nSo, really, you did a nice thing!

OP was certainly justified in feeling the way they did about the possibility of Bob accessing their information without permission and need. \n\nOP, you 1 million percent did the right thing in reporting the violation. I used to work in patient accounts in medical billing and it was the # 1 rule to never violate HIPAA. The fact that Bob didn't stop himself from doing it nor kept the fact he violated HIPAA to himself are 2 huge red flags.

His actions were appalling in many ways.", "It's very worrying that your admin  talked about \"snitching\" and covered the whole thing up. You should inform the clinic that he worked at, formally and in writing. It's their patients that are affected and they have a duty of care to them. Those patients also should be informed that their records have been compromised. The clinic may also need to review their practices and security (like not giving such access to such sensitive data to volunteers). \n\nThis isn't \"snitching\", it's whistleblowing.

His care for the severity of it is zero. That is very concerning!\n\nThen the school found out. If it was just one peek, he would probably have gotten away with a warning.

If you think you should be able to lie and keep his friendship, then yes you would be a gaping asshole.  Integrity for thee but not for me.\n\nIf you come clean to him and suffer the consequences for your principled stand, then you're not an asshole - just a hard-ass.

A lot of hospital systems log whose accounts go into what patient records and will automatically flag ROI/MPI if there's an unauthorized access, some won't even let you access them anymore unless you as a physician are linked in the system to that patient. At the very least, following OP's complaint they were easily able to see the dude accessed EHRs he wasn't supposed to be. Probably got the fear of god put into him and was only allowed to switch careers for threat of never working in health care again if he didn't.", "I think you are especially not the asshole because in that moment he told you he did this to other friends and you had him looked into for looking at your records which he never disclosed. That and considering he is bragging about it, forget it, he did it to himself.", "Snitching wasn't the admin's words, it was the OP's. OP was just paraphrasing using their own words.\n\nAnd in regards to \"covering up\", the admin made the deal he needed to make with OP to convince OP to give the name so they could address it. They knew someone violated HIPAA, they just didn't know who. They could have threatened the full force of the law, not get any name because OP still cared about their friend, and friend would go on to become a doctor and continue violating people's confidentiality.\n\nOr they could have made some kind of compromise to get the name so they could put a stop to it and protect future patients, which they did, and also protected OP's identity. The admin did the right thing. And don't assume the clinic wasn't informed either or that the compromised patients weren't informed of the breach. That's detail that's outside of what OP would be aware of.", "NTA: but Bob sure is. You really did the correct thing both morally and ethically.", "NTA all day. That is an outrageous violation of ethical responsibility. Just completely unforgivable. That person has no business in healthcare if they think that was okay to do.

This flaw you mention is a BIG flaw. If he changed careers he must have realized this as well.", "NTA.  The violation is one thing.

I could probably look him up but I am not allowed to and so I wouldn't.", "NTA. I used to work I healthcare and have EPIC. You are not to access your own health record let alone those of people you have no valid reason for looking at outside of your rolle. You made a good call.", "NTA - if he was anywhere near health files he was trained on privacy ad nauseum and knew he could get the clinic sued for doing that. Even people not involved in health care have to take those courses to be allowed in to those areas - computer techs and printer repair people, etc. Even a casual \u201cI happened to overhear\u2026\u201d is a huge no-no, but actively searching for protected health information for fun is the like number two sin on the list, right after purposely using that to doxx or out someone.

But, you may want to consider that given the circumstances, cutting ties completely with Bob might be for the best.", "That's a pretty big flaw! NTA. And he deserves any kind of punishment that's handed to him.", "NTA\n\nAs a lifelong healthcare worker I promise you Bob would have been caught during the yearly audit soon enough. He has no business in this business.", "He likely has no way of knowing who \"snitched\" because he told so many people. That's gross. I'm pretty liberal with my health info with friends. But I also trust them not to talk about it with strangers, or at all really; unless a situation arises caused by my health issues. \n\nNTA. Even non-medical professionals Bob shouldn't be doing that.", "NTA.  I work un compliance and this is totally unacceptable.  Personal health info can be used to discriminate against people,  which was what Bob was doing.  Hahaha ha person c got herpes.  That isn't funny.  Maybe they were sa'd.  If he didn't know it's because it was none of his business. \n\nYou are not an ah at alllll.", "NTA at all. I work in hospital quality and compliance, HIPAA is taken very seriously. Part of my job involves chart review and compiling data so I\u2019m frequently in patient charts, but I only look for the stuff I need. I don\u2019t go searching for friends or coworkers. A few times I\u2019ve had to look in a coworkers file for some data I was compiling, but I made sure to only look at what I needed for my report (like who their anesthesiologist was or what type of sedation was used). You absolutely did the right thing by reporting him, that\u2019s such a violation and breach of trust.", "NTA\n\nI work in healthcare. This is a big no no. If he can't be professional about medical records, he has no place in healthcare.", "NTA. If he can't be trusted not to spread private information, he's not fit to be a doctor.", "Nta hippa is not a casual guideline!", "Nta. Here\u2019s another thing. The clinic can know. They have access to logs that tell them everyone who has accessed the charts and when and for how long. \n\nI worked medical records for a hospital. I have a degree in health information. I\u2019m even certified. They told me in training not to look at my own medical record, not to look at medical records of friends, not to look up medical records for neighbors.  So I didn\u2019t. Ever. (Though mostly because I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to)\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing about accessing other peoples charts when you work for a health organization. They know. You get a log In To a computer and thats your identifier. The system tracks who has accessed what and at what time and where. He would have got caught. It\u2019s part of their security. They know people do this they tell them not to. Don\u2019t think just because they said don\u2019t do it they wouldn\u2019t check to make sure. These places get in major problems when hipaa is broken. You can be damn sure they want to know who is personally responsible for their hipaa problems. So that not only they get in trouble but the person who did it gets in trouble.  Let me say also that once you get in trouble because you violated hipaa, I imagine it will be quite difficult to get another job in the same field. \n\nIf Bob couldn\u2019t help himself now imagine how worse it would be later. You saved Bob, his future, his future victims, and what would have been his future employer.", "NTA and you did the right thing. Patients are vulnerable to medical professionals, they should be protected from people like Bob. My mom has worked in an ER most of my life.

She doesn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nI thought this was gonna be about him lightly gossiping about patients or situations at work (not that, that would be very professional either), but good lord.\n\nThis is extreme creep behavior. He got handed an extreme level of power and immediately used it for nefarious purposes. That's legitimately scary especially considering it's medical info.\n\nAlso super immature that one of his first instincts is to look up people he went to high school with.\n\nNot ragging on you, but this guy is a huge asshole, why be friends with him?", "NTA. I have an aunt that works at the closest hospital to me. I dont speak to my family but any time I am in medical distress, they know. I used to see a chiropractor until they revealed they regularly hang out with my dad and stepmother- why didn't I speak to them any longer? I had a childhood doctor that was my mothers best friend and I had no privacy until I switched doctors at 18. I am not allowed to get my medical records from before I was 18, my former doctor will not release them unless I come in for a 'meeting' with her. \n\nI'm aware how illegal this is. Currently, I am content to work on my mental health.\n\nFor all of us that are too tired, anxious, and depressed to report this behavior- thank you.", "Not really the privacy of strangers, he likely snooped on the records of everyone he talks to, including OP and friends. OP did what they had to do to stop someone with prying fingers from invading the privacy and trust of the people close to them, without consequence to themself because why should someone have negative effects for doing the right thing?", "The people who would be preoccupied with OP's status as a \"snitch\" are not people I would place much interest in.", "I would bet that admin has seen or heard of other people ruining their careers through stupid choices early on. They saw an opportunity to steer a young person out of a bad fit before they wrecked themselves.\nOf course it could have been an entirely pragmatic course of action to protect the college reputation. But there is a particular frustration in watching lemmings run off a cliff when you could have steered them away if you had known in time. \n\nDo you really think your friend would have been able to resist peeking in records after doing it multiple times? There are plenty of careers where a bit of nosiness and gossip can actually be a strength, maybe he'll be able to thrive in one of those now.", "It sounded like you needed to sit on this one for a few days though. It might have been a clear choice, but that doesn't mean it was a light one.", "I doubt it was covered up. OP didn\u2019t want their friend to be severely punished, so they aren\u2019t gonna be like \u201ctell us the name so we can make sure he never works in healthcare again.\u201d It would be counterproductive. If bob suddenly switched career paths, it\u2019s likely he did get in serious trouble.", "NTA. I work in healthcare and have access to EPIC as well. I make a point of not talking to people I know or looking at their chart. An old coworker of mine from a job 10 years ago called and his name was uncommon enough that I recognized. I answered and explained that I would need to transfer him to another staff member. \n\nI probably would have been fine (as in not caught), but it would have felt like an invasion of privacy to me, and I'm not going to mess with HIPAA compliance.", "Bob is a bad doctor and a bad friend, nta.", ">he said he looked up the health info of some of his high school friends. He said he could get in trouble for doing it, but **he didn\u2019t think the clinic noticed**.\n\nI do hospital IT. EPIC and Cerner (the two largest EMRs) both have auditing enabled on medical records. We can tell who did what to anything, even who just viewed the record. We have to be able to audit this type of information for compliance.\n\nYou were in the right for letting HIPAA know. NTA", "No don\u2019t feel guilty at all, you did the right thing! I\u2019m actually dealing with HIPAA stuff myself at the moment on the behalf of my sister (20). Her doctor ordered a test in September but somehow got lost and sent to a different clinic in the same building. The only just called this week and gave the results to my mom instead of my sister (for some reason they called moms phone when they only have permission to call my phone). My sister was so upset as she doesn\u2019t like my mom to know all her private medical stuff. Thankfully we\u2019re really close to the doctor who did order the test and he is even more upset than we are. He went directly to the chief of the other clinic to find out how this all happened and made the HIPAA complaint himself on them. If a person in health gives out any information especially if it\u2019s really sensitive to someone who doesn\u2019t have approval from the patient then they should pay for what they did. By doing so it can put a persons life in danger in some circumstances. NTA", "Nta. Bob has had enough time for confidentiality to be drilled into him. He made his own bed.", "You did the right thing.  Patient privacy is priority & you're right if he's doing this now, what kind of things would he do when he's an actual doctor?", "Nya", "NTA. Bob had joked that if you need something kept secret, don't tell him. Your medical records are--to an extent--secret. He had no legitimate reason to view the medical records of his friends but he did it anyway. You absolutely did the right thing by reporting him. Hopefully he'll learn from the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. And very much best, for Bob and everyone else, that he switched career paths. I hope whoever talked to him also convinced him ro work on hus ethics and discretion, or this will get him in trouble in almost any career.", "NTA. HIPAA violations are cause for immediate dismissal for an employee of any hospital or health clinic. The fines are enormous, and as a representative of such an institution, the fines would be levied on the institution as well. This young man might be very intelligent but I wouldn't want a doc who finds it entertaining to snoop through people's medical records.", "NTA. And I'm no expert, but I feel like this is one of the few times I've seen the phrase \"HIPAA violation\" used correctly, so extra thanks for that.", "NTA. Bob May not be personally liable for what he did, but clinic would be if anyone found out and decide to sue. I used to work in a research position that involved reading hundreds of pathology reports for cancer patients, including reports for several famous people who were treated at hospital where I worked. They had all already publicly announced their diagnoses, and I didn\u2019t even tell my officemate about the reports. Officemate also read reports for work, and it was random chance that the reports were in my pile, but no one else needed to know the tumor markers for Mystery Celebrity with Cancer.", "NTA, as the admin said if this happened when he was a doctor the law suits would eat him alive. and they can tell who looked into files. You give them bob's name. if bob didn't look then it's a 'no harm no foul'  If bob didn't violate their security protocols then it wouldn't be an issue and is he had they needed to stop him before they got into trouble.", "NTA and thank you for removing him from the field", "NTA - you did the absolute right thing", "Not to be dramatic, but you might\u2019ve saved someone\u2019s life by doing this. People seek Medicare care and disclose very deeply personal things to their doctors because they feel safe. Imagine if someone encountered Bob and found out, they might never feel safe disclosing to a physician again. That could lead to untreated life threatening conditions. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nNot only bc he did it but then he bragged about it! tf", "When I was training on EPIC, only as a check-in/registration, mind you, one of the first things we were warned against was going into a patients chart that we weren't actively working on. They really stressed how bad of a HIPAA violation it was and that not only would we be terminated immediately but could also face charges and steep fines. Whether or not that was true, I never tried. I can't imagine an actual physician would have any fewer consequences, though. Good on you. Plus, this may have directly affected you personally, so I wouldn't feel the least bit bad about it.", "Absolutely NTA. If he's this boastful in abusing his access to the medical information of people he knows and presumably cares about on some level, what would stop him from doing the same to strangers? As a doctor, Bob would have likely violated doctor-patient confidentiality and would not have respected future patients' right to privacy. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nBob doesn't have the professionalism and integrity to be a doctor. I know that doctors and nurses gossip and complain among one another about patients they share, but it's never information illegally accessed, and it's never shared in such a way outside of the office or floor that personally identifying information comes with it.\n\nExample: my mom is a retired l&d nurse. I got some stories, but never specifics or identifiable information. My mom has NEVER identified one of her patients to me in public. I only found out because the patient said something.", "NTA. Bob did this to himself. What he did is a massive betrayal of patient trust.  Eventually the clinic would have noticed what he was doing but you did the right thing reporting him.", "NTA- he wasn't pulling a prank,  he was breaking the law for a laugh at a party. He should not be trusted with a medical career.", "YTA lol\n\nseriously. the amount of fantasy work you did to find a reason to take him down. applause for you lols", "NTA I\u2019ve had the experience of having a doctor who can\u2019t quite grasp what HIPAA is all about and it sucks. You did the right thing.", "YTA, you don't snitch on friends.", "there's no HIPAA violation until the information is disclosed, however NTA.  Bob is a bad person", "I had a friend who would often get someone else to do some work if lab results came from a friend (small town, one hospital.) \n\nShe figured she didn\u2019t need to know that information and it was best if someone else handled it. \n\nI totally respect that.", "No they wouldn't. Bob is sneaking around people's private lives and they telling others, he is literally snitching on medical problems he has no position to tell.\n\nOP ensured that there is less snitching by reporting a massive violation.\n\nIt was the most professional thing to do, something Bob (and evidently you) know nothing about.", "> Integrity for thee but not for me. \n\nIf OP didn't have integrity, they wouldn't have said anything to anybody about this problem.", "[deleted]", "It's really telling that not only Bob did this, but on top of it let it known and laughed at it. That's taking it to another level, and it's not like the base level of the situation was acceptable to begin with. He's not even close to be willing to follow rules. He had no business in that field.\n\nHopefully it will be a lesson for him because even in a different career, there is always some level of discretion involved.", "I was shocked to read your post since there seems to be no indication of a record of who is accessing patient records. I know that in banking, there are logs for that stuff and you can get in serious trouble looking up customer's information without a reason.", "I work in healthcare regulation. I\u2019m guessing they did an investigation around the accounts he accessed and realized the gravity of his HIPAA breach. If it was just 1 account he probably would have been warned and received additional training. He did this to himself", "Why don't you tell him? Seems super shitty to lie to his face every single time you see him. Since you did nothing wrong there's nothing to hide right?", "Yeah I work with a database of protected info (not medical) and a coworker came from the hospital. Part of our training is: \u201cdon\u2019t look up people you know just for shits and giggles\u201d and she mentioned that at the hospital there was something in place that would flag unauthorized access to records. I think that\u2019s a great thing. Because he\u2019ll, sometimes I don\u2019t even want other doctors knowing what I talked about.", "Smooth. Again, you did the right thing.", "The hospital I worked for was one of the largest systems in the state I lived in, and my lab was the only lab that handled some sensitive testing (STD, virus testing, etc). A lot of employees were also patients because logistics/ease. There was an option to have the patient info anonymized for the sample label if the employee wanted it, but the patient file has the correct patient name. I did not even really pay attention to the name beyond last name and patient ID to confirm results.", "Seems even shittier to break HIPAA laws and then *brag about it*.", "Seems super shitty to go behind OP's back, and all of his friends' backs, by looking up their PRIVATE medical information.", "Yep, Bob is a shit friend regardless. It\u2019s not that hard to keep your mouth shut when someone tells you something in confidence.", "> They knew someone violated HIPAA\n\nAnd didn't go through the proper procedures.  Those patients are entitled to know that their confidentiality was compromised. This should have been escalated to a proper complaint whether OP wanted it to be or not. \n\n>protect future patients\n\nThe clinic is supposed to protect *all* patients.", ">OP didn\u2019t want their friend to be severely punished,\n\nOP isn't the controlling authority here, it isn't OP's decision how severely their friend is punished. The patients will not be informed, there will be no investigation, the clinic will not be embarrassed and nothing will change. Sounds like a cover up to me.", "I\u2019m saying the admin likely lied and did punish him. We have no idea if the clinic was contacted. OP didn\u2019t want her friend punished, so in order to get the name of the person they needed to reassure OP that the friend wouldn\u2019t get in serious trouble, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t actually get in serious trouble.", "Thank you for saying all of that. You\u2019re correct, I have no idea what the consequences were, but the fact that Bob changed career paths is very telling to me. If you knew Bob, you would\u2019ve thought that was an impossibility. I trust the administrator I spoke with to have followed the law completely. I do not believe there was any sort of cover up, though I was not informed what actions were taken and I prefer it that way. I find it highly unlikely that my school would\u2019ve cut corners in this regard.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that the first people who were informed that there was any impropriety was our HIPAA compliance office. They were the ones who contacted my admin, and they have no ulterior motives except to enforce HIPAA and protect the school legally. My understanding is that there are processes to deal with violations of this nature and I think they would be the last ones to deviate from them."]}
