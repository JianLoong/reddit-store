Our parents had enough and kicked him out after he became uncontrollable. It was mostly done for me as I was still pretty young.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear from or about him until he was in his early twenties. Turns out, he was married, had a good job and a kid on the way. Now he has 3 kids and is still happily married to a very lovely woman. \n\nWe see each other on Christmas, Easter, thanksgiving and a week during the summer but he mostly comes so our parents can see the kids. He usually doesn\u2019t say anything and keeps to himself. \n\nAt first I was afraid, confused and resentful for a lot of things but I have since forgiven him. He\u2019s not a bad guy-honestly never was. He just needed help. \n\nMy parents hosted thanksgiving and it was pretty normal. The usual. \n\nAll of a sudden, there\u2019s a sound of glass breaking.

In a way, I guess she\u2019s right. I probably should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.

If that isn't a normal reaction from your mom, it sounds like she has a lot of left over emotions about your brother and having to kick him out. She needs to see a therapist. Throwing up your brother's mistakes from his past will only do more damage.", "NTA- but this sounds like a classic golden child/ scapegoat scenario. If you WERE/ARE The GC, you might owe your brother a bit if an apology. Hard to know without more details. But you could read up on it.", "NTA\n\nWhile it is rare, people do change for the better. Yes, he might've been a vile AH in his youth, but as you've pointed out, he's changed and has become a good man. He needs to know that there are people he's wronged who at least no longer harbor hostile feelings against him.\n\nYour mother on the other, sounds like she's got some deeper issues if she's going off on her grandkid for accidentally breaking a glass plate. I get that they aren't cheap, and in some cases they have sentimental value, but how she exploded on him, then your brother, and finally breaking down and blaming him for everything... yeah, something is seriously wrong with her. \n\nShe sounds like she needs some therapy.", "NTA. But mum needs therapy - you guys saw a broken plate - she saw years of pain and disappointment. Suggest to her gently that speaking to someone will help. \n\nAnd maybe have a quiet catch up with your brother to work out some stuff between you without other family members around.", "NTA. He has matured, gotten over his past, and changed; she seems to be holding on to a lot of resentment and anger that spilled out on his son. That kind of anger, built-up anger, makes me wonder what she was like as a mother to him. His silent and swift reaction is also a bit telling. I'm not saying she's responsible for everything that he did in his past, but it sounds like a very toxic relationship, at best. The attempt at pitting OP and the brother against one another via the kicking him out comment is further light on the toxicity. He's grown, hopefully someday she can grow too. OP, you stood up for him and tried to help her see a perspective that wasn't her own; that doesn't make you an AH, but her reaction does break my heart for you.", "First off, in my faith (Christianity) we're taught that Jesus is a god of second chances. So I'm a big believer in second chances and those who went the wrong way in life, being given a second chance to make it all right. Your brother saw his chance, seized it - with both hands, tightly - and went on to make it work. BIG time. Kudos to him, and he deserves a round of applause.\n\nThen, the situation you described. There is NOTHING more painful for a penitent or reformed person to hear the past being dredged up just for the opportunity of having a bullet to fire at the penitent or reformed person. Therefore, your mother was indeed TA. Double TA points for her, because she immediately played the victim with her tears when your brother showed how insulted he felt, in the most polite way possible, and your brother is the victim here by having his past thrown into his face by force.\n\nSo, now it comes down to you. You were, absolutely and certainly, NTA. You stood up for your brother because you had faith in his reformed character. You believed he found his way to a good path in life. And you expressed your confidence and trust in him, by correcting your mother, who obviously was being unfair to him. So in conclusion, I reiterate, you are NTA.", "She might\u2019ve just permanently ruined her relationship with her son and lost having one with her grandkid because she couldn\u2019t recognize the personal growth of her own son.

Your mom is reacting to a lifetime of repressed pain. They were just reacting to different things. You can all have sympathy for each other.\n\nYour mom's outburst is assholeish.

Even as a grand parent she has no right to yell at a child.\n\nBy your brothers reaction, he seems to have learnt some healthy coping mechanisms and have his life sorted. Obviously doesn't excuse the stuff he had done previously but it's unfair that your mother brought it up when he probably already feels like shit over it.\n\nI say he will probably go NC with her. Your best action is to stay neutral and stay our of it and to keep a good relationship with both sides. Sometimes it's best to not be involved. \n\nIf he does go NC just make sure you support his decision and to not try to persuade him to change his mind. Your mother unfortunately was in the wrong. In cases like this he certainly does have the right to protect his children from that. \n\nA grand parent having visitation and able to have a relationship with a grand child is a privilege that can be revoked, but was probably best not to say that because she obviously knew that.\n\nYour mother and brother will sort it out over time, best to not pick a side or try help mend the relationship.

I do feel bad for what you and your parents went through. I would say there are unresolved issues due to his past behavior. People are allowed to forgive in their own time.

Mom likely does need therapy and has needed it since forever ago but she prides herself on being strong so who knows if she\u2019ll ever bite. \n\nAs for my brother and I, I would be willing to talk but he just does not seem interested in furthering our relationship (he isn\u2019t even interested in getting close to our parents and keeps himself at length).

What your mom did was wrong and she should be proud of the man he's become now instead of holding a grudge for the rebellious son he used to be. He's grown a lot and made good things happen for himself. Your mom was also very wrong for screaming at an innocent 8 year old. Children are fragile and it was over an accident. It's not like the kid was being intentionally malicious and breaking the plate on purpose. Like, mom needs therapy to get past some problems. She's holding onto too much and it doesn't sound like she's able to move on without some help.", "NTA.

You told your mom a hard truth she needed to hear. She hasn\u2019t forgiven your brother his past and sue to that she\u2019s now lost him again, probably for good. And a truth you need to see is that your mom resents you too. Her statement that she kicked out her child for you says a volume of resentment. Good luck OP.", "NTA. Firstly - he has absolutely every right to keep his kids away from the mother, even if he was the AH, no reason even required. Your mom looks like an AH here but she seems to have unresolved issues and may benefit from therapy. Perhaps OP can suggest this as a way to get past the grief (and she maybe more open to the idea if its presented to her this way). If she was that strong (and maybe she has been till now), this incident would not have happened. She expressed a lotta grief amongst a whole other range of emotions here- including downright ugly ones.", "NTA. You were right to defend your brother. His past self is not his present self. Your mother lost it on an innocent child and then took it out on everyone else. She is the one in the wrong here.", "NTA but also reach out to your brother tell him you don\u2019t hold any resentment and want to build a healthy and positive relationship with him and his family and for now just let it be you and he working on y\u2019all\u2019s relationship. As far as your mom goes she got angry at her grandchild and yes over reacted on both your brother and nephew then got upset your brother did what a parent should do and removed his child from a bad situation. Then she got upset he took her grandkids away, no she needs to own up that her behavior did that and maybe suggest getting some therapy so your brother will feel more comfortable bringing his kids around. She should never blame you for a decision she made, she may have done to to protect you but it was still her decision to kick him out. Lastly once your mom has worked on her feelings about your brother from the struggles when he was younger to how he is now then and only then let your brother know she\u2019s been working on stuff and at that time it may be good for them to work on their relationship. It also sounds like your brother has worked very hard to become a better person and that should be recognized", "NTA OP.\n\nbut.... your mother is, erm, different. blaming one kid in favor of the other kid. and vice versa. and blowing up at a kid for breaking a plate? plates are easily replaceable. relationships are much harder to fix.", "NTA, and I'd bet money mom is a lot more responsible for brother's bad behavior than you may have picked up on growing up.

I can completely understand that if he was doing things that jeopardized your safety as a child, that he may have needed to be removed from the situation(tho I cannot say whether or not your mom and dad went about this the right way), and that your mother very well could have some trauma from the situation herself, but that's no excuse to take it out on his kids. \n\nAddiction is an enemy that could nab anyone, good people and bad people alike. Having an addiction doesn't make someone a bad person, and good on your brother for making it through to the other side. And double good on him for having the self control to walk away from that situation. And for sure, good on you for defending him.

You didn\u2019t ask them to do because at that time it appeared to be only option. If your mother has guilt about this, she can\u2019t blame you and needs to live in the present.\n\nYour nephew did this accidental, he was trying to help and her response was shout at him and upset him.

And if you are a parent, you extend that lack of trust to those around your children in order to protect them. Be patient with him. Please do not ever pressure him to have a relationship with your parents or to have his children around them. Do understand that you likely remember his childhood very differently than he does because you were younger and treated differently. Therapy for you can be helpful too.

Praise it when it did the correct thing, and redirect when it did the wrong thing? \u2026OR did you just react (poorly) when it did the only thing it could, after being ignored and left alone for far too long? At the end of the day, that mistake is not on the fucking dog.\n\nI started using drugs and getting into dumb stuff when I was way too young. I wish my parents could have helped me, but to this day (I\u2019m 32 now) it seems they would love nothing more than to forget that it ever even happened. I got myself out of it, with therapy, medication and outpatient treatment. And it took YEARS. And despite doing a difficult and frankly pretty rare thing, there is no positive support or celebration - mostly just discomfort when its brought up at all. \n\nIt sounds like your brother has also done the hard work and corrected his own path - and has received nothing but continued grief from the family anyway! It\u2019s not a safe place for him to be, so why should he ever step foot in his mothers house again?", "NTA. My dad used to scream at me for minor things like that. I grew up with PTSD, toxic perfection, depression and anxiety. I bet she was like that with your brother, too.", "Your mom has anger issues and as a small child your brother shielded you from them. Then he left and your mom didn't want to lose her remaining child so she made you the golden child. \n\nBut that left for your brother the role of scapegoat. She threw her son away. She could have gotten him counseling or rehab but she threw him out of her home. \n\nHe was willing to put up with this behavior towards him because a small part of him will always believe he is this person\n\n\u201coh shut up, maybe if I yelled at you more you wouldn\u2019t have made everyone\u2019s life a living hell.\u201d \n\nBut he knows his child isn't that person and he finally saw that your mom will not stop at abusing and berating him. She will also do it to his children.\n\nYou have lost your brother unless you reach out and form a separate bond with him away from your parents. Never mention you still have a relationship with him and you will be fine. \n\nYour brother is not evil person who made everyone's life a living hell. \n\nHe is the scapegoat and you are the golden child. \n\nhttps://hopefulpanda.com/golden-child-and-scapegoat/", "NTA your mom not being able to handle an 8 year old dropping something and reacting that way is why your brother is keeping his kids safe.\n\nMaybe her emotional immature played a role into his issues and why being away from your parents is why he\u2019s doing well. Probably why he and his wife were on the same page and reacted as a team.\n\nAgain for those \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d folks. Yes as a teen he had an addiction and did shitty things and bad parenting is not at fault. Addiction is an illness and parental pressure are a good one/two punch for a developing brain.", "NTA--It sounds like your brother has made a good life for himself and it was most likely due to getting away from the family, ie: your mom.

There is a lot more to what was going on with your brother in childhood than you likely know, and sounds like there is trauma on both sides, but your mother's behavior was inexcusable and counter-productive, and you calling her out on it is something she needs to hear.

Your mom needs therapy.", "Nta, for real. If she clearly has admitted to causing him religious trauma, it's more than likely that she abused him in other ways as well.

Because that's what it is. she fucked up and then immediately placed the blame on your brother because she 'didnt deserve to not have access to the grandchildren\". \n\nI'm also going to be real with you, you likely have been deliberately blocked from directly witnessing her real treatment of him. Did he likely act out in the ways she said? Absolutely. But probably as a direct result of her abuse. A close friend of mine experienced similar abuse; their sibling was always treated infinitely better than they were and their mother worked very hard to make sure they never realised how badly they were treating my friend. They still dont understand, years after my friend went no contact.\nI guess what I'm saying is this: you did the right thing defending your brother.

He likely doesnt know you care, or how you even believe he may not have been completely in the wrong. Tell him. Validate him.

My brother also got kicked out but he's only a year and a half younger than me, we have three additional younger siblings and everything was about keeping things pure for the youngest ones. There was a ton of pressure on us as the older children in a religious family. My brother goes to family events now and brings his kids but it is hard for us because our parents were abusive to us. They weren't abusive to the youngest children and they treat them completely differently. The youngest children have no idea how our dad was to us or how he was before he became religious when we were really young. They never had to go pick out a belt from the belt rack and get spanked so hard they couldn't sit down for days. We took the brunt of that anger and we experienced our parents before they became better at being parents and they often treat us like we are the failed children and they don't know what they did so wrong. They worked us from a super young age, my dad had trauma of his own and anger issues and his discipline was very very harsh and also tied in with religion and God which made it complicated and difficult to understand.

I only share this to give you a perspective of an older child of religious parents who has a sibling who also got kicked out and has trouble coming back around later.

You should leave and educate yourself in all the evils the Church has done in the name of \"salvation.\"", "It is entirely possible that your Mom abused him and he abused you.
