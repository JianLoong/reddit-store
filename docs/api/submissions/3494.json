Our parents had enough and kicked him out after he became uncontrollable.

If that isn't a normal reaction from your mom, it sounds like she has a lot of left over emotions about your brother and having to kick him out. She needs to see a therapist. Throwing up your brother's mistakes from his past will only do more damage.", "NTA- but this sounds like a classic golden child/ scapegoat scenario. If you WERE/ARE The GC, you might owe your brother a bit if an apology. Hard to know without more details. But you could read up on it.", "NTA\n\nWhile it is rare, people do change for the better. Yes, he might've been a vile AH in his youth, but as you've pointed out, he's changed and has become a good man. He needs to know that there are people he's wronged who at least no longer harbor hostile feelings against him.\n\nYour mother on the other, sounds like she's got some deeper issues if she's going off on her grandkid for accidentally breaking a glass plate. I get that they aren't cheap, and in some cases they have sentimental value, but how she exploded on him, then your brother, and finally breaking down and blaming him for everything... yeah, something is seriously wrong with her. \n\nShe sounds like she needs some therapy.", "NTA. But mum needs therapy - you guys saw a broken plate - she saw years of pain and disappointment.

He has matured, gotten over his past, and changed; she seems to be holding on to a lot of resentment and anger that spilled out on his son. That kind of anger, built-up anger, makes me wonder what she was like as a mother to him. His silent and swift reaction is also a bit telling. I'm not saying she's responsible for everything that he did in his past, but it sounds like a very toxic relationship, at best. The attempt at pitting OP and the brother against one another via the kicking him out comment is further light on the toxicity. He's grown, hopefully someday she can grow too. OP, you stood up for him and tried to help her see a perspective that wasn't her own; that doesn't make you an AH, but her reaction does break my heart for you.", "First off, in my faith (Christianity) we're taught that Jesus is a god of second chances. So I'm a big believer in second chances and those who went the wrong way in life, being given a second chance to make it all right. Your brother saw his chance, seized it - with both hands, tightly - and went on to make it work. BIG time. Kudos to him, and he deserves a round of applause.\n\nThen, the situation you described. There is NOTHING more painful for a penitent or reformed person to hear the past being dredged up just for the opportunity of having a bullet to fire at the penitent or reformed person. Therefore, your mother was indeed TA. Double TA points for her, because she immediately played the victim with her tears when your brother showed how insulted he felt, in the most polite way possible, and your brother is the victim here by having his past thrown into his face by force.\n\nSo, now it comes down to you. You were, absolutely and certainly, NTA. You stood up for your brother because you had faith in his reformed character. You believed he found his way to a good path in life. And you expressed your confidence and trust in him, by correcting your mother, who obviously was being unfair to him. So in conclusion, I reiterate, you are NTA.", "She might\u2019ve just permanently ruined her relationship with her son and lost having one with her grandkid because she couldn\u2019t recognize the personal growth of her own son.

Your best action is to stay neutral and stay our of it and to keep a good relationship with both sides.

What your mom did was wrong and she should be proud of the man he's become now instead of holding a grudge for the rebellious son he used to be. He's grown a lot and made good things happen for himself. Your mom was also very wrong for screaming at an innocent 8 year old. Children are fragile and it was over an accident.

Firstly - he has absolutely every right to keep his kids away from the mother, even if he was the AH, no reason even required. Your mom looks like an AH here but she seems to have unresolved issues and may benefit from therapy. Perhaps OP can suggest this as a way to get past the grief (and she maybe more open to the idea if its presented to her this way). If she was that strong (and maybe she has been till now), this incident would not have happened. She expressed a lotta grief amongst a whole other range of emotions here- including downright ugly ones.", "NTA. You were right to defend your brother. His past self is not his present self. Your mother lost it on an innocent child and then took it out on everyone else. She is the one in the wrong here.", "NTA but also reach out to your brother tell him you don\u2019t hold any resentment and want to build a healthy and positive relationship with him and his family and for now just let it be you and he working on y\u2019all\u2019s relationship. As far as your mom goes she got angry at her grandchild and yes over reacted on both your brother and nephew then got upset your brother did what a parent should do and removed his child from a bad situation. Then she got upset he took her grandkids away, no she needs to own up that her behavior did that and maybe suggest getting some therapy so your brother will feel more comfortable bringing his kids around. She should never blame you for a decision she made, she may have done to to protect you but it was still her decision to kick him out. Lastly once your mom has worked on her feelings about your brother from the struggles when he was younger to how he is now then and only then let your brother know she\u2019s been working on stuff and at that time it may be good for them to work on their relationship. It also sounds like your brother has worked very hard to become a better person and that should be recognized", "NTA OP.\n\nbut.... your mother is, erm, different. blaming one kid in favor of the other kid. and vice versa. and blowing up at a kid for breaking a plate? plates are easily replaceable. relationships are much harder to fix.", "NTA, and I'd bet money mom is a lot more responsible for brother's bad behavior than you may have picked up on growing up.

Having an addiction doesn't make someone a bad person, and good on your brother for making it through to the other side. And double good on him for having the self control to walk away from that situation. And for sure, good on you for defending him.

You need to not think him being kicked out was your fault. Quit letting your mom blame you and your brother for her life. Tell her she needs help.

Please do not ever pressure him to have a relationship with your parents or to have his children around them. Do understand that you likely remember his childhood very differently than he does because you were younger and treated differently. Therapy for you can be helpful too.

I got myself out of it, with therapy, medication and outpatient treatment. And it took YEARS. And despite doing a difficult and frankly pretty rare thing, there is no positive support or celebration - mostly just discomfort when its brought up at all. \n\nIt sounds like your brother has also done the hard work and corrected his own path - and has received nothing but continued grief from the family anyway! It\u2019s not a safe place for him to be, so why should he ever step foot in his mothers house again?", "NTA. My dad used to scream at me for minor things like that. I grew up with PTSD, toxic perfection, depression and anxiety. I bet she was like that with your brother, too.", "Your mom has anger issues and as a small child your brother shielded you from them. Then he left and your mom didn't want to lose her remaining child so she made you the golden child. \n\nBut that left for your brother the role of scapegoat. She threw her son away. She could have gotten him counseling or rehab but she threw him out of her home. \n\nHe was willing to put up with this behavior towards him because a small part of him will always believe he is this person\n\n\u201coh shut up, maybe if I yelled at you more you wouldn\u2019t have made everyone\u2019s life a living hell.\u201d \n\nBut he knows his child isn't that person and he finally saw that your mom will not stop at abusing and berating him. She will also do it to his children.\n\nYou have lost your brother unless you reach out and form a separate bond with him away from your parents. Never mention you still have a relationship with him and you will be fine. \n\nYour brother is not evil person who made everyone's life a living hell. \n\nHe is the scapegoat and you are the golden child. \n\nhttps://hopefulpanda.com/golden-child-and-scapegoat/", "NTA your mom not being able to handle an 8 year old dropping something and reacting that way is why your brother is keeping his kids safe.\n\nMaybe her emotional immature played a role into his issues and why being away from your parents is why he\u2019s doing well. Probably why he and his wife were on the same page and reacted as a team.\n\nAgain for those \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d folks. Yes as a teen he had an addiction and did shitty things and bad parenting is not at fault. Addiction is an illness and parental pressure are a good one/two punch for a developing brain.", "NTA--It sounds like your brother has made a good life for himself and it was most likely due to getting away from the family, ie: your mom. He is protecting himself and his family by staying away and not furthering relationships.

There is a lot more to what was going on with your brother in childhood than you likely know, and sounds like there is trauma on both sides, but your mother's behavior was inexcusable and counter-productive, and you calling her out on it is something she needs to hear.  Connecting with your brother and offering your support, while also encouraging your mom to let the past stay in the past might help heal the wounds for both.  Your mother really needs to apologize to her grandson, though.", "NTA and you shouldn\u2019t have kept your mouth shut. She was out of line and cruel. And did they really cut ties for you?

Your mom used you to justify kicking him out, you are her beard. Did he cause her anguish? Yeah . She resents your bro and took it out on the nephew who was trying to help, how horrible. That poor little kid. My admiration for your brother for getting clean, that\u2019s not easy, not a big % succeed, he did. I\u2019m glad you are ok with him now.

There is most likely a lot that happened that you never knew about. Simply because you were young. I would talk to the aunt that you mentioned as well.

It got to the point that even when he wasn't around, if I dropped a plate, I would start to cry because I didn't know if I needed to hide it or if I should own up to it. Which would cause more or less yelling at me? \n\nHe's better now. Because he got help. He needed it too, just like your brother.\n\nBut I am watchful. Of my kids and him. I teach my kids to be careful, but accidents can happen. And they have. My dad pulls a face and shakes his head, but he doesn't yell. He doesn't get angry. I help my kids clean up the mess, and we move on. \n\nMy kids have fun at their grandparents' house.

Did your mom get help?", "Absolutely NTA and trying to \"remind\" you that kicking him out back in the day was \"for you\" is deflecting. She was being deliberately cruel to both the kid and your brother. He must have worked really hard to get to where he is now and has probably been worried about losing this chance to be a part of the family again, or robbing his kids of the chance, and has been careful around your parents but your mum on the other hand seems to have some latent resentment towards him.

Your mom needs therapy. She shouldn't have lost it an an 8 year old child. Yelling would only do the exact opposite of what she wanted to do, and just traumatise a child. I'm sure breaking a plate by mistake wouldn't lead an 8 year old to the path of drugs anyway. Your brother seems to have gotten his life back on track anyway, without her help, and she should not hold the mistakes of his adolescence against him. Your brother has every right to keep his kids away from your mother, as their dad.", "So let me understand this. She yells at her grandson for accidently doing something that if she would've done as an adult no one would even think to yell at her.

Because that kind of response to a child making a mistake would drive anyone to drugs", "NTA\n\nTaking out frustrations like that on an 8 year old little boy is wrong.  Saying what she did to her son was wrong.  Saying those things have consequences.  Your brother leaving with his family so he didn't have to deal with it was the right course of action.  Your mom needs therapy.", "Nta, for real. If she clearly has admitted to causing him religious trauma, it's more than likely that she abused him in other ways as well. She clearly needs some intensive therapy and perhaps you do as well at least to understand how to redirect/unpack her manipulative behavior. Because that's what it is. she fucked up and then immediately placed the blame on your brother because she 'didnt deserve to not have access to the grandchildren\". \n\nI'm also going to be real with you, you likely have been deliberately blocked from directly witnessing her real treatment of him. Did he likely act out in the ways she said? Absolutely. But probably as a direct result of her abuse. A close friend of mine experienced similar abuse; their sibling was always treated infinitely better than they were and their mother worked very hard to make sure they never realised how badly they were treating my friend. They still dont understand, years after my friend went no contact.\nI guess what I'm saying is this: you did the right thing defending your brother. But if you want to keep your brother, if you want him in your life, you need to keep supporting him. He likely doesnt know you care, or how you even believe he may not have been completely in the wrong. Tell him. Validate him.

Your mom obviously hasn't let her anger and resentment for him go, and now it might have cost her her grandchildren.", "NTA - your brother is being the parent to his son that neither of you got from your parents. You sided with him because he is correct here. I'd hazard a guess that your mother's reaction here is what led to your brother's addiction in the first place.

From your post it sounds like he just sort\u2019ve popped up with a wife and kids and said \u201cI\u2019m different now,\u201d and while that\u2019s great that he got to a better place on his own, it does not change what he put his family through prior. \n\nYour mom definitely needs individual therapy and she owes your brother and your nephew an apology.

Yes it was probably very difficult parenting your brother during his wild years, and yes she may have kicked him out to protect you, but that does not abstain her from wrong doing forever.  She was very wrong to yell at the child for an accident, and to say what she did to your brother.\n\nIt's good to hear your brother is doing so well, it sounds like he's done a lot of hard work on himself, and rightly removed his family from the situation when it turned bad.", "NTA and see if you can leave as soon as possible.

You were not wrong to tell her so.

My brother also got kicked out but he's only a year and a half younger than me, we have three additional younger siblings and everything was about keeping things pure for the youngest ones. There was a ton of pressure on us as the older children in a religious family. My brother goes to family events now and brings his kids but it is hard for us because our parents were abusive to us. They weren't abusive to the youngest children and they treat them completely differently. The youngest children have no idea how our dad was to us or how he was before he became religious when we were really young. They never had to go pick out a belt from the belt rack and get spanked so hard they couldn't sit down for days. We took the brunt of that anger and we experienced our parents before they became better at being parents and they often treat us like we are the failed children and they don't know what they did so wrong. They worked us from a super young age, my dad had trauma of his own and anger issues and his discipline was very very harsh and also tied in with religion and God which made it complicated and difficult to understand. There was a lot of Shame guilt and anger in our childhood. I only share this to give you a perspective of an older child of religious parents who has a sibling who also got kicked out and has trouble coming back around later.

This was in the 70s and we experience racism there as there were only 8 black children in the school and 6 of them were my family. So I know it's not perfect.

She may have also punished him for what she believed was a lie and then told her religious leader what he said which would have made the abuse worse.

They cannot have that structure dissolve around them, the loss to the local community would be too great. But they will not forget the crimes of previous clergy members and remain vigilant. \n\nTo that end, I can understand the sense of homey-ness and importance of a church that feels like it's yours, so to speak. The sense of community, empowerment, and belonging you can find is invaluable to both individuals and communities. I hope it's not too presumptive but I see that as part of the necessity you mentioned of a Black Catholic Church. \n\nUnfortunately for me, my formative experiences with the church were on the opposite end of the spectrum with it as a monolith of influence over local laws and local social norms.

This was a loved and trusted member of the church. He privately told me it was because he could. This led to me being offered the chance to doing an extra year of CCD (I was scheduled to be confirmed with my friends the following year, which meant an extra year of time that I was not interested in to begin with) OR 20 hours of \"private community service\" with the priest, whatever that meant. I explained that I would not be punished for something I didn't do and refused both. My parents switched me to another local Catholic church where I ended up having the same CCD teacher as the classroom I switched into. This sweet woman told my mother how happy she was I was in her class and how wonderful I was last year. My mom instantly apologized for not believing me because the woman said that the priest lied to her about something and made her want to change churches. I also had to repeat the year to be confirmed anyway.

Or both.\n\nBut the mental gymnastics is astounding because the real turn of events on that day was: after snapping at a child, this caused the parents remove that child for his safety, only for her to cry \"why are they keeping my grandkids away\" as if she didn't cause the problem in the first place.\n\nYes, lots of therapy please, and a genuine apology is needed before I'd let my child near her again. As a side note, she's going to have to open her wallet up real wide (between gifts, therapy, presents, travel, outings, extra meals, and such. not that I condone bribing a child for affection) if she is ever going to repair her relationship with her grandson, if ever. Or she is no longer his preferred grandma.", "This. I suspected abuse before that moment happened. Why? I was the supposedly evil child. Born evil according to Mother. Both my parents were/are monsters. He died and 0 of his children mourned. Mother was angry at us all for that. As if it would not be the same for her. Both earned this. Both are also the sort of people who don't ever hear the reason why someone's cutting them off. They just cannot. You can write it down, scream it, sing it. Never gets through. They just tell everyone you are cruel. I was seen as evil by everyone because of them before I was 5. At 17 I cut mother off the first time. Had cut him out at 13 to not be murdered. I skipped and went back. Same bullshit. \n\nBeing significantly younger than their sibling OP doesn't remember necessarily enough to know or the abuse is normal. Not every abuser will abuse all their children the same way. The way the brother left and didn't even ask what happened says a lot. It's good OP can see this first hand because it holds the answers to the truth. \n\nOP if you read this? I want to be wrong. I just struggle to see how someone would be comfortable jumping to abuse like your mother did and this not being a pattern. Your father said and did what here? If nothing? That is enabling. People do not jump to drug use without s reason. I admit I am even skeptical of that being true. Missing reasons parents are consistently unable to be factual. This is entirely shaped by my experiences with my own abusive parents and being the scapegoat. So i do mean it when I say I want to be wrong. You should ask your brother for his side of things", "Also! He was young when he was an AH. By the use of \"bratty,\" the bad behavior probably started in elementary school at the latest. So. Largely shaped by his parents and their beliefs and reactions at that point. He was apparently at least mostly reformed by his early 20s.\n\nIf this is mom's reaction to an 8 year old making an honest mistake, imagine what her reaction was to OP's brother when he was being a stubborn, tantruming AH child (because yes, children can be and often are assholes, it's just more excusable when they are because they're still learning). \n\nIt's making me wonder if being NC with his/op's parents was an essential part of him healing and learning how to not be a dick....", "Your mom sounds like a professional \"victim.\" Maybe ask for your older brother's side of the story first before you make any judgement on your mother. Definitely NTA for defending your older brother, your mom was being cruel to an 8 yr old and demanding compassion and understanding from other people when she should've shown compassion to her grandson.", "Here's something you will learn as you get older: two siblings in the same household can have VERY different experiences. You were likely too young or too uninformed to see your parents abuse for what it was. To your brother, abuse may have been his baseline experience of your parents. The axe forgets what the tree remembers.", "Your mother was the problem then and is the problem now.\n\nI'm willing to bet what she has told you isn't the whole story or the whole truth.", "Maybe consider scrolling through r/raisedbynarcissists. It might be more relatable to you than you\u2019re expecting and potentially give you some insight. It sounds like your mom was pretty abusive and just hid it well.", "Agreed. But golden children always benefit at the scapegoat\u2019s expense. It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault, but it\u2019s good to acknowledge the disparity.", "Holy shit, I'm amazed at how much your brother turned his life around. It's really impressive.", "Yes!!! Breaking the cycle and ending generational trauma is extremely difficult and a very brave thing to do. So many people cannot. He deserves so much credit for that!", "My long lost sibling! How have you been?", "the old adage is \"the axe forgets what the tree remembers\". Mom has obviously buried/forgotten/minimized the abuse she perpetrated but to the brother it defined his childhood and continues to have impact on his life in adulthood. The most frustrating part for any adult child in this situation is how the abuser tries to play dumb about the horrific shit they did to a CHILD like it was just another Tuesday.", "\"Act out\" often means \"self medicate\".", "Guarantee that isn't the first time she screamed at a child either. Wonder what drove brother to drugs and acting out in the first place?", "I've been great since the escape! How are YOU?", "I don\u2019t know. From the comments, it seems like OP is still at least partially on her parents\u2019 side. She isn\u2019t a safe ally for her brother. Maybe someday but not yet.", "Ditto! As long as we have at least a thousand mile buffer, she and I have a decent relationship. We currently have more than double that and communicate almost exclusively via text so it's usually pretty easy to maintain civility.", "Hello, fellow traumatized by the \u201csacrament\u201d of confession buddy! I was talking to someone in another thread about this recently. \u201cFirst Confession\u201d is a big deal and you\u2019re only SEVEN. I was terrified, I never liked going, and my dad basically forced it every few weeks for years. The idea that a child is capable of mortal sin; the fact that as you grow older you may feel like you have to confess sexual sin\u2026 it makes me so angry now.", "I keep a 20 mile buffer, but I'm not worth the effort to drive that far for, so life is grand", "Even if your brother himself wasn't abused, he probably had friends who were and who were not believed.", "Maybe, just let him know that if he ever wants to talk, you're there for him. Then he can make his decision but knowing that you're there for him.", ">Our younger sister has no issues with her, but we had both moved out young, so she has no memory of how things were for us.\n\nIsn't that strange? My sibling is 16 years younger than I am, and my mom got divorced and remarried after I left the country at 18, so we had completely different experiences with almost completely different parents.", "It's likely this is also why he holds you at arms length,  and until you are able to see who he is now vs what he did to you neither of you will be able to form a closer bond. I do not in any way mean that you need to do that, and I'm not trying to minimize what happened to you, you have every right to hold onto that. I only say it that way because if you're not able to forgive him he's not going to be able to move past it fully either. If you really want a closer bond as adults you'll have to work past the past together, and he'll have to want the same. \n\nAs for your initial question you're NTA for defending him to your mom. He deserved your defending and you should let him know you think he handled the situation wonderfully with packing his family and getting his son out of there without further escalating things in front of his children.", "It's so strange. I mean, yeah, she was ten years more mature, and I do think she learned something from us limiting contact for the next decade\u2026 that if she didn\u2019t want to lose her youngest too, she needed to settle down (though she claims it was because we were more rebellious, and she stuck number here in a religious school to fix the problem)\u2026 but also, her third is a lot more like her and gives as good as she gets. \n\nIt\u2019s like these people that defend corporal punishment because it didn\u2019t hurt them\u2026 not every kid is the same\u2026 so even if kid three was raised at the same time, she might have been fine and just made mum think twice about her parenting methods before she had to learn to duck\u2026 but she arrived late to the party. So I became a \"yes mum\" kid and tried to duck as much as I could, and little bro hid and self medicated to get through the last few years.", "I reiterate; yes, and?\n\nEveryone is entitled to their feelings but I'm not sure what those feelings have to do with the generational trauma resulting from the documented and acknowledged institutional abuse in multiple countries by the Catholic Church that I'm referring to. Could you please clarify what you mean?"]}
