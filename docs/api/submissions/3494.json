He was essentially one of those bratty and evil kids you read stories about.\n\nHe got older and got into drugs and other illegal stuff. Our parents had enough and kicked him out after he became uncontrollable. It was mostly done for me as I was still pretty young.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear from or about him until he was in his early twenties. Turns out, he was married, had a good job and a kid on the way. Now he has 3 kids and is still happily married to a very lovely woman. \n\nWe see each other on Christmas, Easter, thanksgiving and a week during the summer but he mostly comes so our parents can see the kids. He usually doesn\u2019t say anything and keeps to himself. \n\nAt first I was afraid, confused and resentful for a lot of things but I have since forgiven him. He\u2019s not a bad guy-honestly never was. He just needed help. \n\nMy parents hosted thanksgiving and it was pretty normal. The usual. \n\nAll of a sudden, there\u2019s a sound of glass breaking. My nephew accidentally dropped a plate while trying to help my mom set up. \n\nMy mom loses it. She starts yelling at him. The poor kid starts sobbing (he\u2019s only 8) and runs to his mom. \n\nMy brother obviously asks our mom what that was about and that it was just an accident and my mom immediately goes \u201coh shut up, maybe if I yelled at you more you wouldn\u2019t have made everyone\u2019s life a living hell.\u201d \n\nMy brother didn\u2019t even react. He and his wife just gathered their kids and left. My mom immediately started to cry once she realized he wasn\u2019t coming back and said that she didn\u2019t deserve this and that he has no right to keep her away from her grandkids. \n\nI told her that he actually does have the right to do that especially since she lost it on his innocent 8 year old son.\n\nMy mom started to cry even harder and said that she didn\u2019t need my opinion and that she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m on his side after everything he did and everything she did to protect me from his addiction etc. \u201cI kicked my child out of the house for you.\u201d Is what she said. In a way, I guess she\u2019s right. I probably should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. But my brother has grown so much as a person and it didn\u2019t feel right to hear her still blame him for the actions of his child/teenage self.

Your mother shouldn't have lost it on a 8 yr old.\nMakes me wonder if she has history of abusive behavior that could have contributed to your brothers addiction", "NTA. He didn't do anything to intentionally antagonise the situation, that was your mother unleashing likely years of repressed guilt and anger at him. Your brother exited the house rather than argue back, that's more mature than your mother did.", "NTA. Brother likely got therapy and the mom still needs to go. Resenting your own kid even after seeing them thrive. \n\nIs she trying to hold on to the martyrdom?", "NTA. Yelling at her grandkid (8yr old) for *accidentally* dropping a plate? Then she *insults* her son and *holds a grudge against him* for doing better for himself? THEN she cries and makes it about herself, then says \u201cI kicked him out for you\u201d like it\u2019s YOUR fault your own brother got kicked out. Instead of giving him resources and actual help, she kicked him out?\n\nAre you serious? The lack of accountability, the intense rapidly changing emotions, the yelling\u2026she needs therapy.

He has changed and matured, she is still holding onto past resentment which unfortunately spilled onto his kid.\n\nTough situation man, but you did good I think.", "NTA. If that isn't a normal reaction from your mom, it sounds like she has a lot of left over emotions about your brother and having to kick him out. She needs to see a therapist. Throwing up your brother's mistakes from his past will only do more damage.", "NTA- but this sounds like a classic golden child/ scapegoat scenario. If you WERE/ARE The GC, you might owe your brother a bit if an apology. Hard to know without more details. But you could read up on it.", "NTA\n\nWhile it is rare, people do change for the better. Yes, he might've been a vile AH in his youth, but as you've pointed out, he's changed and has become a good man. He needs to know that there are people he's wronged who at least no longer harbor hostile feelings against him.\n\nYour mother on the other, sounds like she's got some deeper issues if she's going off on her grandkid for accidentally breaking a glass plate. I get that they aren't cheap, and in some cases they have sentimental value, but how she exploded on him, then your brother, and finally breaking down and blaming him for everything... yeah, something is seriously wrong with her. \n\nShe sounds like she needs some therapy.", "NTA. But mum needs therapy - you guys saw a broken plate - she saw years of pain and disappointment. Suggest to her gently that speaking to someone will help. \n\nAnd maybe have a quiet catch up with your brother to work out some stuff between you without other family members around.", "NTA. He has matured, gotten over his past, and changed; she seems to be holding on to a lot of resentment and anger that spilled out on his son. That kind of anger, built-up anger, makes me wonder what she was like as a mother to him. His silent and swift reaction is also a bit telling. I'm not saying she's responsible for everything that he did in his past, but it sounds like a very toxic relationship, at best. The attempt at pitting OP and the brother against one another via the kicking him out comment is further light on the toxicity. He's grown, hopefully someday she can grow too. OP, you stood up for him and tried to help her see a perspective that wasn't her own; that doesn't make you an AH, but her reaction does break my heart for you.", "First off, in my faith (Christianity) we're taught that Jesus is a god of second chances. So I'm a big believer in second chances and those who went the wrong way in life, being given a second chance to make it all right. Your brother saw his chance, seized it - with both hands, tightly - and went on to make it work. BIG time. Kudos to him, and he deserves a round of applause.\n\nThen, the situation you described. There is NOTHING more painful for a penitent or reformed person to hear the past being dredged up just for the opportunity of having a bullet to fire at the penitent or reformed person. Therefore, your mother was indeed TA. Double TA points for her, because she immediately played the victim with her tears when your brother showed how insulted he felt, in the most polite way possible, and your brother is the victim here by having his past thrown into his face by force.\n\nSo, now it comes down to you. You were, absolutely and certainly, NTA. You stood up for your brother because you had faith in his reformed character. You believed he found his way to a good path in life. And you expressed your confidence and trust in him, by correcting your mother, who obviously was being unfair to him. So in conclusion, I reiterate, you are NTA.", "She might\u2019ve just permanently ruined her relationship with her son and lost having one with her grandkid because she couldn\u2019t recognize the personal growth of her own son. NTA. You were 100% right. You definitely should\u2019ve defended him.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your brother are reacting to the short term glass/outburst incident. Your mom is reacting to a lifetime of repressed pain. They were just reacting to different things. You can all have sympathy for each other.\n\nYour mom's outburst is assholeish. But given the life history, it's actually understandable.\n\nI say get everyone in a room with a therapist!

You can maybe help her with it; probably with an external counselor would be good. Progeny that goes off the rails can be extremely tough, but taking it out on an 8YO is not good.", "NTA. Your brother is likely a scapegoat and you are a golden child.", "NTA and I think you did the right thing by speaking up! In fact I think you should reach out to him and let him know your found your mum\u2019s reaction out of place. Even if you\u2019re not that close, which is understandable, he may appreciate the thought. \n\nAnd don\u2019t let your mum make you feel guilty! You didn\u2019t ask for your brother to be kicked out of the house, you were likely too young to understand. Maybe there were alternatives your parents could have considered, maybe there weren\u2019t, no one knows now. But it\u2019s not on you. \n\nYour brother sounds like has turned into a good man who is worthy of respect, and everyone deserves a clean slate after that. Your mum needs to get onboard if she wants a relationship, and you can steer her that way if you want.", "Nta. Unfortunately addiction is a hard thing, but it sounds like your brother is on a really good path staying clean, so it's bad that your mother still resents him and still treats him like how he used to be instead of how he is right now.\n\nA plate breaking is 100% not a good reason to yell at a child and is a complete accident. Even as a grand parent she has no right to yell at a child.\n\nBy your brothers reaction, he seems to have learnt some healthy coping mechanisms and have his life sorted. Obviously doesn't excuse the stuff he had done previously but it's unfair that your mother brought it up when he probably already feels like shit over it.\n\nI say he will probably go NC with her. Your best action is to stay neutral and stay our of it and to keep a good relationship with both sides. Sometimes it's best to not be involved. \n\nIf he does go NC just make sure you support his decision and to not try to persuade him to change his mind. Your mother unfortunately was in the wrong. In cases like this he certainly does have the right to protect his children from that. \n\nA grand parent having visitation and able to have a relationship with a grand child is a privilege that can be revoked, but was probably best not to say that because she obviously knew that.\n\nYour mother and brother will sort it out over time, best to not pick a side or try help mend the relationship. It's on your mother to apologise to him and actually have a conversation.\n\n*I also have a brother who was an addict and done some horrendous stuff, so I do understand the resentment. But your brother isn't the same person as he was back then.", "NTA\n\nI almost feel like you should send your bro a message or give him a call or something. Just to say you didn't like how your mum handled that and you understand why he would want to remove his children from that situation. You don't have to say anything about his past.\n\nIf I understood the post correctly you defended him after his family left, so he may be thinking everyone agreed with your mum.", "Info: have you tried reaching out to your brother independently of your parents?", "NTA. I do feel bad for what you and your parents went through. I would say there are unresolved issues due to his past behavior. People are allowed to forgive in their own time. He is not owed anything because he is a different person today. Apologizing is just the beginning. As others have mentioned, entire family needs to see a therapist.", "The suggestion that more yelling would have prevented him from going down a bad path speaks to that.", "Idk if it\u2019s the worst thing but when my brother was a child, he would refuse to go to church and threw tantrums and the sort which used to make my mom very upset as she was extremely religious at the time. She told me that she has regretted some of the things she said to him but won\u2019t tell me what she said.\n\n But apart from this, I don\u2019t believe there was anything that could be considered bad and she ended up distancing from the church not long after and it was never mentioned again. The only reason I still remember this is because my aunt made a comment about it earlier this summer and your comment made me think.", "NTA but you can\u2019t say just because their kid is thriving doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t resent them still. Nothing erases the shit that they have put you through. We don\u2019t have any details on how bad it was, how much the mum contributed to the issues, and how they have tried to make it up since if they had to", "I don\u2019t think this was the case. Our parents loved (love) him with all their hearts. He\u2019s forever going to be their firstborn and only son the same way I\u2019m their youngest and only daughter. I think this is my mother feeling guilty for kicking him out when technically she could\u2019ve taken him to a mental health professional instead of assuming he was just out of control.", "\u201cShe saw years of pain and disappointment\u201d.\n\nMaybe. Or maybe the brother could write a book about his path to drug addiction and the whole other side of the story.", "In a sense, I get it, I really do. But now I also understand why my brother was so hesitant to let his kids around us. Mom likely does need therapy and has needed it since forever ago but she prides herself on being strong so who knows if she\u2019ll ever bite. \n\nAs for my brother and I, I would be willing to talk but he just does not seem interested in furthering our relationship (he isn\u2019t even interested in getting close to our parents and keeps himself at length). He sincerely apologized and all that so I\u2019m not holding it against him. Perhaps one day.", "Respectfully, if she saw all of that in a plate but zero progress in her own son, she\u2019s a fucked up person and I can certainly see why he didn\u2019t get the help he deserved when he was younger. That\u2019s a ridiculous statement to make in all fairness.", "This is the problem. Your mother just let your see a bit of what she put her child through in that encounter with your nephew.", "That sounds like he may have had reasons to act out. If a mother won't say what she said then it had to have been bad. Not excusing his behaviour. of course.  Can you contact him and talk to him? If I may ask what kind of church was it?", "She didn't get him any help at all? Went straight to kicking him out? Mate, that's cold.", "Maybe send a message reaching out, how proud that you are of him and that you wish to build a positive relationship with him and your family and hold no resentment\n\nHe probably needs to hear that and you'll find he won't be as hesitant to build a relationship with you.\n\nAlthough both him and your mother definitely needs more time before that happens. Your mother needs therapy but unfortunately it's easier said than done.", "Life is long when we\u2019re lucky - who knows if you and your brother will reconcile in the future? But for now if you can, maybe let everything settle - you can\u2019t force change on others successfully and your mum clearly isn\u2019t ready.", "It was after a really bad fight which resulted in me getting hurt and they were afraid for my safety-which is why my mom said she kicked him out for me. But I agree. If I were in my mom\u2019s situation, I would not have done the same things she did."]}
