A 40 person wedding versus 300? No way. Beyond the money (which is huge) it is a completely different event.

This is the perfect way to handle it. First off, it's your day. If they want guests you don't care about having, they will have to fork out the money.

You don't owe anyone a grand wedding. Your brother's assessment is correct.", "NTA and this is perfect, assuming you and your partner are actually ok having these extra people. If you're really not ok sharing your day with distant relatives and your Jr. High karate instructor, you should just say NO. \n\nIf you proceed on your current course, you should take it one step further though and make it perfectly clear that X amount of contribution only buys X number of seats, it doesn't buy influence over what the cake looks like, what kind of flowers there are, what entertainment is provided, etc. Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where the parents' contributions really aren't covering increased costs. \n\nIt's not you or your partner's fault if your parents started inviting family members before a guest list was finalized - that's on them.", "Nta. Oh darling that is perfect.", "NTA,  but I have to tell you, inviting people to the ceremony but not the reception is really tacky. If you can't afford to have them at both, don't invite them to just one. How would YOU feel?", "NTA and hold your ground with both sides.", "NTA, but your brother is right when he called you a magnificent bastard. That is an elegant solution and forces them to put their wallets where their mouths are.", "NTA. Good move on your part. As long as they aren't contributing to the wedding, they have no say at all. And even if they contribute, their say should be nothing but suggestions, who they think should be invited.\n\nAnd they need to give a good reason for each and everyone they want to invite. Something like your hypothetical reasoning at the beginning of your post doesn't count as a good reason. If something like that happens, that's not your fault, but the fault of Jemima who doesn't invite your mother for such a shallow reason.", "NTA. And omg...thank you for the laughs", "INFO - why didn\u2019t you just tell your parents and in laws upfront that they could invite whoever they wanted as long as they paid the cost of each guest on their list? Why wait until they made their list to tell them you expect them to pay?", "NTA, but pretty immature. Just put your foot down and say \"it's our wedding, we're only going to invite the people we want to be there.\" There's nothing wrong with that approach.\n\nYou may not realize this, but you're opening the door to a LOT of future conflict if any of the 2nd tier invite list finds out you were essentially bribed to invite them.

You didnt outright say no, you explained the situation to them and allowed them to make a decision. You basically told them you're happy to invite everyone but dont have the money for it so IF they really want all those people they would need to be paid for some other way.

Kindergarten teacher, neighbor from down the street from their 1st or a dozen houses 30 year ago, delivery nurse.  \nMIL was so proud she wanted to show the world.  \nIt all got noped out pretty quickly.", "Straight up, this is BETTER. If you offer them the choice of inviting as many people as they're willing to pay for, then you also leave open the argument that they can invite anyone they want over your objection, because they're paying. It also gives them time to talk themselves into the expense of inviting more people, right up to the limit of their wallets.  \nDropping the lump-sum amount on them is a hard shock and makes it an all-or-nothing choice with a very clear price tag. Can't swing the big bat?
