A 40 person wedding versus 300? No way. Beyond the money (which is huge) it is a completely different event.

This is the perfect way to handle it. First off, it's your day. If they want guests you don't care about having, they will have to fork out the money. Obviously, money needs to be paid in advance - you don't want to get into debt because of people you don't care about having there. I wish I had your same idea, yous are just brilliant!", "NTA. Your wedding your rules. Plus going from 40 to 300?? That\u2019s ridiculous and frankly weird on their end", "You \"parented\" the parents into the reality of life, in this case the costs of a wedding...\n\nNTA", "NTA. You don't owe anyone a grand wedding. Your brother's assessment is correct.", "NTA and this is perfect, assuming you and your partner are actually ok having these extra people. If you're really not ok sharing your day with distant relatives and your Jr. High karate instructor, you should just say NO. \n\nIf you proceed on your current course, you should take it one step further though and make it perfectly clear that X amount of contribution only buys X number of seats, it doesn't buy influence over what the cake looks like, what kind of flowers there are, what entertainment is provided, etc. Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where the parents' contributions really aren't covering increased costs. \n\nIt's not you or your partner's fault if your parents started inviting family members before a guest list was finalized - that's on them.", "Nta. Oh darling that is perfect.", "NTA,  but I have to tell you, inviting people to the ceremony but not the reception is really tacky. If you can't afford to have them at both, don't invite them to just one. How would YOU feel?", "NTA and hold your ground with both sides.", "NTA, but your brother is right when he called you a magnificent bastard. That is an elegant solution and forces them to put their wallets where their mouths are.", "NTA. Good move on your part. As long as they aren't contributing to the wedding, they have no say at all. And even if they contribute, their say should be nothing but suggestions, who they think should be invited.\n\nAnd they need to give a good reason for each and everyone they want to invite. Something like your hypothetical reasoning at the beginning of your post doesn't count as a good reason. If something like that happens, that's not your fault, but the fault of Jemima who doesn't invite your mother for such a shallow reason.", "NTA. And omg...thank you for the laughs", "INFO - why didn\u2019t you just tell your parents and in laws upfront that they could invite whoever they wanted as long as they paid the cost of each guest on their list? Why wait until they made their list to tell them you expect them to pay?", "NTA, but pretty immature. Just put your foot down and say \"it's our wedding, we're only going to invite the people we want to be there.\" There's nothing wrong with that approach.\n\nYou may not realize this, but you're opening the door to a LOT of future conflict if any of the 2nd tier invite list finds out you were essentially bribed to invite them. Way better to avoid all of this by simply telling your parents and soon-to-be-in-laws that it's not your problem if someone else made a bad assumption about who would or would not be invited.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Other drama, but not about guest lists!", "NTA! My parents were similar to this too. We agreed that the costs for any people they wanted to invite did not count toward my budget since I didn\u2019t care if they attended, and they were even paying for the whole thing! I can\u2019t imagine having them demand I invite people, forcing me to pay more", "NTA", "NTA this is glorious. \n\nIf I were your parents I'd agree and find budget to pay, but only for the most unhinged guests ever seen at a wedding. \n\nAn uncle speaking exclusively in facebook pirate.\n\nA former friend known for his removable teeth tricks.\n\nA god-fearing grand-grand-aunt whose major gripe is she is leaving this world in a few months and still you had the AUDACITY to serve chicken at the reception.

If they keep pushing you keep saying no and if they still don\u2019t respect your wishes, establish boundaries to let them know that your wishes for how you conduct your lives are non negotiable.", "you ARE a magnificent bastard.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. You didnt outright say no, you explained the situation to them and allowed them to make a decision. You basically told them you're happy to invite everyone but dont have the money for it so IF they really want all those people they would need to be paid for some other way. That gave them the option to decide if they really wanna pay for some of these people, or any of them for that matter.\n\nYou're not manipulating them, you're allowing them to make informed decisions.

I LOVE the way you handled this and I flat out cackled when reading it.  :)", "So, they want you to invite people you don't know and have you pull the money out of you bum? - NTA", "NTA. In fact, you're kind of my hero. This is how everyone should respond to this type of parent request. That being said, how seriously are your/her parents taking this? Is there a likelihood that either side will end up giving you a trimmed-down guest list along with the money? Because even if your parents trim to like, 40 people each, that would still triple the size of your wedding, which would suck since you two want a small wedding.", "NTA. You magnificent bastard.", "Nta. And this is why I'm getting married by God damn elvis in vegas.", "NTA\n\nThey are happy to spend your money. So why not their own if it is that important?", "NTA, but not really all that weird, when my best friend got married, the MIL wanted to invite everyone that had ever interacted with her kid. Kindergarten teacher, neighbor from down the street from their 1st or a dozen houses 30 year ago, delivery nurse.  \nMIL was so proud she wanted to show the world.  \nIt all got noped out pretty quickly.", "Straight up, this is BETTER. If you offer them the choice of inviting as many people as they're willing to pay for, then you also leave open the argument that they can invite anyone they want over your objection, because they're paying. It also gives them time to talk themselves into the expense of inviting more people, right up to the limit of their wallets.  \nDropping the lump-sum amount on them is a hard shock and makes it an all-or-nothing choice with a very clear price tag. Can't swing the big bat? Then it's a walk and you take the base you're given."]}
