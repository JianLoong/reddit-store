He was the second youngest of the family. \n\nAfter we both graduated university and had steady jobs we got married. Just a small ceremony with his family and our friends. We were 25 at the time but before we got married we always wanted kids. Well, after a long, desperate and heartbreaking journey we now have our daughter (18 months. aprox 1.5 years old) and we love her to pieces. Let's call her M.\n\nWell, two weeks ago me and my husband were both called to our jobs which we usually never are so at least one of us would be able to stay with M. We couldn't decline so we gave her over to my MIL. M has an allergy to bananas. It is not a deadly severe allergy but she will cry in pain because it causes her rashes. I told my MIL and told her we don't keep bananas in the house because it could cause irritation.\n\nWhen I was finally packing up to go home I got a call from my MIL saying that M was crying and wouldn't stop so I called my husband and rushed home. When I get there I see red rashes all over my poor baby's body while there were tears spilling out of her eyes. I didn't even have time to ask what happened before I quickly took M to the hospital. My husband came to the hospital and we were told it was an allergic reaction and that M did not need to stay over night, just a few hours. When we finally got back home and my husband asked my MIL what happened. My MIL tells us without any sense of remorse or shame that she gave M bananas.\n\nEverything in me snapped as I yelled at her repeatedly about how M could have possibly had a worse reaction and that there shouldn't be any bananas in the house in the first place. She said that maybe the allergy could be \"fixed\". I told her she should get out of the house and that she will never be allowed to see my daughter again. She said she wouldn't leave and I threatened to call the cops on her. She got angry and finally left.\n\nNow I am constantly getting calls from my husband's family calling me selfish and an ahole because my MIL took me in when I was a stranger but I wouldn't let her see her grandchild. My husband has told them off multiple times and said if they were to continue acting like this then they aren't allowed anywhere near us. \n\nI feel terrible that I'm splitting my husband and daughter away from their family but the safety of my daughter is not something to take lightly.

IF they realise their mistake,  apologize,  and accept that you will not let them near your child until she is capable and ready to speak up for herself and keep her own personal boundaries,  and you yourselves are ready of course, you might pick up where you left off then. \n\nWhy would you do this? To get them to stop harrassing you, to allow your husband to have a relationship with his family, should he want to, and to still be able to say 'uhm.. NO' down the line. \nIf they don't stop harrassing you, it's totally NC, so there's that.", "NTA\n\n\"She intentionally poisoned my daughter, she will never be in the same room as her again.

Even the banana allergy. MIL got some jail time for it", "I landed on NTA, but I was briefly wavering between that and E.S.H., which might surprise you. \n\nI'll start with my concern that almost led me to E.S.H.   You had and have many choices for dealing with this other than going full and immediate no contact with her -- including but not limited to supervised visits.  Based on your description, it seems like, in the heat of the moment, you didn't take even a half a second to consider those options.  This makes me worry for the day when you daughter or another loves one makes a big mistake.  Do you have a habit of making quick and extreme decision in the heat of anger?  I hope not.  \n\nHaving said my piece about this, the nature of your MIL's mistake is really, really, really concerning, which is why I moved to a \"not the AH\" verdict fairly quickly. \n\nYour MIL didn't just forget about the banana allergy.  She *knew*.  She didn't miss the word \"banana\" when reading a label and accidentally give something containing bananas to your daughter.  No. It wasn't like that. \n\nIn order for this mistake to occur, she had to either proactively bring bananas from her home into yours or  go out and buy them. This was premeditated, so to speak.  It makes my blood boil to imagine her transporting the bananas, peeling them,  cutting them up (presumably) and letting your daughter touch them and eat them  *knowing full well* that it would cause your daughter to suffer.  And at no point in that chain of events did she confer with you, your husband, or anyone else that might have a knowledge and understanding of allergies and/or your daughter.  \n\nShe perhaps didn't understand that her actions would hospitalize your daugther.  Maybe should thought the reaction would be mild. This is the most charitable perspective I can muster. But even then, why would a loving grandmother want to cause even a mild level of suffering in a child?  \n\nAnd then she got angry?!  What?!
