I'm glad the school has video footage of Beth's interactions because without it she might lose her job due to unfounded accusations. These kids need to learn there are consequences for bad behavior and not being able to participate when you really want to is a great natural consequence.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to learn the consequences of her actions and the importance of respecting authority figures. It's not fair for her to expect special treatment just because she wants to cheer. Beth is just doing her job and enforcing the rules. It's unfortunate that your daughter will be missing out on cheer events, but she needs to take responsibility for her own behavior.", "Kudos Dad, not only did she have a meltdown, she also disrespected the trainer by not showing up at her assigned time, but rather waiting till the end of practice.

Don't fight the decision by saying the coach is wrong, take her side and work with her for a better resolution for everyone.", "NTA, there are consequences to our actions, including being on time. Hopefully your daughter learns a lesson about being on time from now on.", "Don't be that parent. Your kid screwed up and now is learning a good life lesson.", "NTA. One major reason students are so disrespectful is because their parents are the same way; the parents enable their kids' bad behavior and don't make them take responsibility for their actions.

He and his dad (oldest nephew) live with me, so I parent him quite a bit. He plays select baseball, which is very competitive -- even at a young age. When he was 7, I noticed him talking back to the coaches while in the dugout and on the field. He was giving them attitude and snapping at them. These guys are all in their 30s/early 40s, and they just put up with it. I walked over to the dugout and pulled him out to tell him if he ever disrespected anyone like that again, I would pull him out of the game. When we got home, I grounded him for a week. The same thing happened again when he was 8. I walked to the dugout, pulled him out and made him apologize and then pulled him from the game (after talking to the coach). He was grounded for two weeks (no gaming) and gave him extra chores.\n\nHe's now 9, and while 7 and 8 were challenging years in getting his attitude under control, he has greatly improved and matured.

We had to get a heart check/lung check,and be cleared by a doctor to play in order to reduce injury and death.\nHe was a man that did not take any injury lightly. \nA kid fainted? Resting indoors with water until practice is over. And the band\u2019s \u201cdoctor\u201daka a retired nurse checked them out to see if they needed an ER/doctor or just go home. \nA kid busted their lip? Cannot play until swelling went down.

Did the trainer insist I remain benched for the entire time I was supposed to. Absolutely yes because that was their freaking job.", "Because \"my precious angel would NEVER\".

Many schools require an impact test at the start of the sports season to have a baseline in the event a student athlete hits their head. The impact test is then performed after an injury to determine how long the athlete needs to wait before returning to activity.", "The daughter knew that if she missed that appointment she wouldn't be able to cheer. She also knew when school vacation happens and Beth's schedule is probably backed up due to having to have appointments with dozens of students before the sport starts.

The mom wants the kid to be able to continue their extra curriculars, which can have many benefits for the kid, but also agrees they should be punished.

So he experienced way more \"soft\" blows to his head. Even if it never gave him a concussion, those repeated impacts to his head accumulated over time. I don't know if that has affected him yet, or if it even will at all, but him and his wife decided that their 1.5 year old son will never be enrolled in an impact sport like that. I absolutely agree with that decision. His mom protests about it every once in a while and says it's overprotective, but she doesn't get a say in the matter and, to an extent, she might be trying to absolve or justify her own parenting choices.

Hence 50% wrong, because she is 50% right for the punishment.   You aren\u2019t mathing fairly!\n\nBut in addition, a kid\u2019s extracurricular activities are different than social stuff, and i am not automatically willing to assume mom is a monster because she wants her daughter to experience the full length of the activity.  She is being an asshole about it but this is causing a 3 week gap in this activity which is a significant chunk of time, and that can\u2019t be gotten back.

This is all on the daughter's behavior and her missing 3 weeks of cheer is just the natural consequence of missing that appointment. It's a good punishment because it's teaching her that actions have consequences. She's grounded because she was a dick, not because she missed the appointment but because of how she acted. She's losing 3 weeks because she missed the appointment, not because of how she acted. They're separate punishments for 2 different things and both should held up to teach her separate lessons."]}
