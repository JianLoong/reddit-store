It will be difficult for her to argue that.", "NTA. It's still early so hopefully no one bought presents for you yet. Although, I gotta be honest here and say that if your mom or any other member of your family gives you crap bc you can't buy expensive gifts, then they're totally an asshole. The holiday season is supposed to be about love and kindness, not buying the perfect gift and spending all your money on it.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s weird your mother calculates gift worth and keeps track of it to price match. Feels very un-Christmas to me and becomes basically transactional.", "NTA. Your mother and family gift-giving sounds stressful and horrible. No one should be keeping track of how much you spend and whether they think it is worthy. Honestly, my family decided years ago to stop giving gifts and instead donate to charity. How many $100 stupid tchotchke gifts do people need, especially when it is just to keep score? A perversion of the point of Christmas, in  my opinion.", "NTA  If your mother gets angry then pull the plug on gifts altogether.  Gifts are nice but they aren't or shouldn't be the main focus of the holidays.", "NTA\n\nI think homemade gifts are a great idea! The time put into homemade gifts makes them more valuable than something store bought imo.

It's good to break this cycle or at least not participate in it any longer. And fortunately, you have a really easy excuse this year. You don't have the money!\n\nLet her be mad or try to guilt you. It doesn't matter. She's wrong and her feelings are not yours to manage. \n\nI would just tell everyone that due to financial constraints, you and partner will give out homemade, small gifts.

Small gifts that are thoughtful or meaningful but whose monetary value is not calculated or compared.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is going about this horribly", "Christmas isn't about gifts, and if anyone in your family can't understand your situation, shame on them.  YWNBTA letting them know that you are not able to afford any lavish gifts this year.  If you do the name drawing thing, just ask that you and SO be left out.  Don't stress yourself out!  It's not worth it!  I think your homemade gifts are a fantastic idea!  I would hope your family doesn't shame you for not participating in what sounds like an unrealistic price range for a per person gift!  I have to say, if mom (or anyone) gets mad, they are the asshole.  Good luck!", "You are now adults, perhaps stop the gift giving completely?  If you are all price matching, you would be better off just spending the money on yourself anyway as it has taken the love and caring out of gift giving as it is now the $ that counts more than the gift.\n\nSome families switch to a secret santa once everyone is adults.  But I would set a Max value on the gift and keep it low - like $50 - or even $20 (buys a nice pair of wool socks!).  \n\nOr just announce that your family will no longer give or receive gifts at Christmas.  That allows everyone else to do as they like.  Then make some great cookies and maybe a basket of crafts free for the taking or not!\n\nOnce there are kids involved, it gets more complicated as some families have more kids than others and some have none, so resentment can build up.  So, tackle that while you are at it - maybe make kid gifts an experience thing - a trip to the zoo, or movies or something else that is reasonable priced - remember it is about spending time with the kids, not about how much money you spend.  It doesn't have to be a Disney trip.", "YWNBTA. Tell them right now that things are tight this year because you lost your job. Don't wait until they have already purchase those $200 gifts. \n\nLosing your job kind of ruined your holiday, too. \n\nYou don't need to spend a lot of money to have fun at Christmas. Our family went from presents to everyone, then to presents for children only, and now we draw a name. The other side of the family has a Secret Santa with a $10 gift and that is the most fun event of all because we are allowed to steal 3 times if we like someone else's gift better. So much laughter!

If your family, particularly your mother- takes issue, then they would be the AH. \n\nYour mother needs a dose of reality. If she can\u2019t be sensitive to your changed financial situation, she\u2019s definitely the AH. People should not be going into debt for buying a mess of THINGS to make up for appearances. How much stuff do adults need, anyway? Adults mostly buy themselves stuff all year long.

(The white elephant isn't crap stuff either, we all try to pick out quality things).\n\nHow we do it is like this:\n\nEveryone's gifts go in the communal spot/table. Everyone pulls a playing card. King is high, and in case two cards are the same number, it goes hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs. Person with the highest card picks a gift first and unwraps it. Second person either picks a gift or steals the other person's (and they pick a new one). Red cards for steal, black cards for new gift. Once everyone has had their first turn, draw new cards and go again, this time where red means trade. \n\nWe're making it more vicious this year with rules like couples can't trade each other, because that's too safe. Trades can either be the person's who turn it is with someone else, or they can force two others to trade.\n\nWhat us \"younger\" ones love about it is a list:\n\n* it keeps it more financially affordable\n* it prevents gifts for the sake of gifts/balancing out how much was spent on someone\n* no one \"needs\" things anymore; we're all adults and buy what we want/need, and if we don't, it's because it's too expensive and therefore to expensive to give as a gift as well\n* most of us are trying to get rid of crap and don't want more funny shirts from amazon that will never be worn and can't even be used as rags because the material is crap\n* it brings us back to the spirit of, which is time together and making memories, and gets rid of the commercialism and vanity that it's become", "NTA, you can only do what you can do.

It went over decently, and though we had a grumble or two coming our way, it was great, and it took us right out of all the drama. The next year, one of his siblings followed suit.
