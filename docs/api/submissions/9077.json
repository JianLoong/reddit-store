He knew I was the black sheep of the family, so he took advantage whenever he could and humiliated me to make me feel better.

Family my a$$", "NTA.\n\nStick to your guns and well done to you for making such a success of your life, ignoring the ignorant and selfish naysayers you grew up with!", "NTA, not only does he not have the qualifications, you would be risking your professional reputation. If his resume is as light as suggested, then your company would wonder if you had their best interest at heart in recommending him. Not to mention co-workers who would suffer should he be hired based on what would be viewed as your support.\n\nHe's a big boy and can find his own job. You owe neither him nor your parents a damn thing. You worked hard and made a life for yourself. Your reward? having the means to live your best life without your parents and twin. Enjoy, life is short. If everyone is so concerned with this when they ignored your plight for years, then they should be able to provide all the support he and his family needs without you.", "NtA, they didn't treat you like family, fuck em. You are not responsible for your brother or his family. Surprised you haven't gone full no contact with all 3 of them.", "Stop taking their calls. They only take, and take, and take from you; but they give you nothing in return. Not even respect. NTA. These are your lifelong abusers.", "Blood means nothing.  You do you boo.", "NTA guess his wife will have to find a job then, because why on earth would you risk your reputation for a man with zero qualifications.", "NTA\u2026.do not do it.   You will regret it.    Number one, he is not qualified.  Number two, he has been nothing but hateful to you your entire life. He has undermined you at every chance possible.  He has not changed.  He will not change.  You cannot change him.  But you can change how you react to him.  Stop letting him or your parents rule your life.  They made their choices.  They will have to live by those choices.  They will figure it out.  Personally, I would block them and have no contact. They all sound toxic.", ">I lost friends because he was always hitting on them (he's really ugly, none of them liked him)\n\nNTA regarding the job situation, but your whole abrasive, immature post and this line kinda makes me want to go ESH", "Wow. Nice wall of text. Ever think about paragraph breaks?", "What's worse, is he would do a terrible job and probably find a way for her to do the work for him if possible using every excuse in the book of why she has to help him \"if\" he was there. Don't ruin your work reputation for someone that can't perform and do a terrible job. This may reflect poorly for OP in the future.", "There are a lot of children out there whose parents need a helping hand.  I don't see why your brother's kids are any more deserving of your help than any of those kids.  By your parents' and your brother's choice, you have never been made to feel part of the family.  Do you even have a relationship with those kids?  I can't see why you need to feel responsibility for them over any other children in bad circumstances.", "You mean the same blood family who was unfair to her at every point of her life and didn't stop humiliating her in the entirety of her childhood but only turns up when he needed help?", "There is always something icky when people say \"but it's your blood\"   like what in the eugenics is this.", "Except that he is unqualified for the job, doesn't seem to have grown up at all, and will probably badmouth her if he does get the job.", "Exactly, OP needs to protect her professional reputation. No one likes nepotism (except the beneficiaries of it) in the first place, but to have an incompetant colleague foisted on you because of it makes it so much worse.\n\nIf OP tries to move jobs in the future she could find it significantly harder because people in her industry will gossip about how she brought her useless brother on board and caused a lot of problems for her current employer. Other potential employers will then decide she's not worth the trouble as they don't want the same thing to happen again.\n\nSeriously OP, you need to think about your future here. I doubt your brother would lift a finger to help you if you were ever in trouble, he won't show an ounce of gratitude, and it could backfire spectacularly. Keep refusing and block people if necessary.", "NTA\n\nDon't help him. Recommending someone like him could ruin your career.", "NTA\n\nEven if he was completely qualified for a position at your company, I'd still say *don't help him in any way*.\n\nHim and your parents hounding you is just another example of them shitting on you for his benefit. If you lost your job, would any of them help you? Likely, NO!  These people are users and assholes. You should probably cut all contact with all of them, but you don't, then you should set up *very strict* boundaries. Don't provide any monetary or other help. You will be used and dismissed.\n\nGo live your best life and only deal with them on your own terms.", "He would destroy your career if you helped get him a job in your company.  He sounds extremely nasty and would quite likely target you due to the jealousy.  Do you want to help him torpedo your life and means of supporting yourself? I would go NC with the lot and I would do a preemptive strike in your company,  as he sounds like the type to approach your company covertly and inform them you are his sibling to wheedle his way in. Be warned.  NTA", "Helping someone like this get a job at your company would be \"setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\"", "I think you should help your brother for your niece and nephews sake. I understand your rivalry with your brother. And you can have boundaries with him, and don\u2019t need a relationship with him, but I could never on my conscious allow a sibling of mine to go homeless with an entire family.", "NTA. They\u2019ve verbally abused you your whole life. Let him figure it out and go NC with these people. They are not your family. Create your own support group and focus on yourself. Leave them behind in your rear view mirror.", "Its probably best you cut off ties with your family and get into therapy. Make sure to block their numbers so they cant reach you.", "He was never a good influence around you, aside from what it means to you should also consider what it could mean for you if he works in the same company. Don't let others guild tripping you into this, ultimately you are helping him and you will have to deal with him and also he created this situation for himself. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't have the qualifications and experience necessary for the job. If you recommend him and the employer finds he sucks at his job, that's your name and reputation being dragged through the mud. Don't do it.", "NTA\n\nIf you pull strings to get him a job, it could hurt your work reputation and/or relationships when he shows to be incompetent.\n\nThe way he and your parents treated you, I would be no contact with them. They don't deserve your help.", "NTA. He made his bed, Let him sleep in it.", "He's not qualified, he will bad mouth you and even if he doesn't, he will mess up and ruin your reputation because you recommended him. Nothing good could come from this. Don't do it. NTA", "NTA... dont get involved. It will turn around and bite you or your brother will become a dependent.  Either would not be helping only enabling.", "NTA and truthfully the family history is irrelevant. If he\u2019s not qualified to work for your company you\u2019d be shooting your self in the foot if you vouched for him and got him a job he\u2019s not qualified for.", "nta. You haven't gone nc with these toxic people ?", "NTA.  Do not recommend your shitty bro for any position, contract work or introduce him to relevant people in the industry.  Your professional reputation matters is far more valuable to be trashed by your bro because of his lack of experience, skills and unprofessionalism.   He\u2019s going to be homeless if he lose his current job?  Not your problem.  The moment he decide to be a parent he should make provision for rainy days given he was earning good money. \n\nWhat l want to know is: OP, your parents and brother are toxic as fuck, why are you still in touch with them and put up with the abuse, insults, and be treated like you are nothing?  Perhaps it\u2019s time for NC?", "Info: were you two separate eggs that got fertilized or was your brother conceived after you were already an embryo? Im quite curious because the later is extremely rare and your wording made me think of the latter. If I\u2019m remembering right, there were only 5 recorded cases of that. \n\nRegardless, NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt will make you look TERRIBLE if you recommend an incompetant person who doesn't perform. Just say, we have no openings for someone with your experience at the moment. If that changes I will absolutely let you know.\n\nIt's the truth but it isn't saying \"I don't want to\"", "NTA. Maybe block his number. His children are his and his partners responsibility. Why can\u2019t the partner get a job? Definitely not your problem.", "NTA and it would be a huge risk that could affect you professionally if he fails", "I wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nHe sounds like the type who would constantly badmouth you to make himself look good. \n\nTo be honest, from what you describe I don\u2019t even think he would get the job. You would destroy your social capital at work to get him an interview where he\u2019d make you look bad. I guarantee he\u2019d say he\u2019s the smart twin and that he knows more than you and  on and on. NTA", "NTA he can expirence actually getting a job like everyone else not expecting to just be given one", "Have a hard time believing this story", "It's right to hate abusers.", "THIS!\ud83d\udc46", "Considering how rare it is, I wonder if that's actually what happened, or if OP actually just happened to develop better even though they were conceived at the same time."]}
