To make matters worse, they always wanted to have a male child, as they say \"women are difficult to raise\". All my life I served as a slave in my house, not being able to have anything while my brother was spoiled and given everything he wanted. During birthdays, I never got anything from my parents, only from relatives, and when the party was over my brother would get my gifts for him while my parents didn't say anything. I lost friends because he was always hitting on them (he's really ugly, none of them liked him) and he told my friends that I was fake and badmouthed them behind their backs (which was a lie). He knew I was the black sheep of the family, so he took advantage whenever he could and humiliated me to make me feel better. I was extremely humiliated during my life by him and I only got freedom when I turned 18 and went to college. My aunt paid for my college because my parents didn't want to spend money on me, when my parents found out, they demanded that I ask my aunt to split the money between me and my brother, as he had already spent a large part of it buying a new car. When I denied it, they yelled at me, called me names and didn't speak to me for months. My brother was always jealous of me, so he chose the same course as me when he found out I was going to study software engineering (he has never shown interest before). However, when we graduated, he went to work at a friend's company in an administrative position, earning well and without specializing in the area in which he graduated. It's been about 15 years since we graduated and I'm now in a great job in a very specific field that pays a lot. The company my brother worked for went bankrupt and when that happened he called me (after years) to ask me to get a job where I work for him. I said I wouldn't help him, because in addition to hating him, his resume is terrible and he has no experience in the area after years of graduation. He told our parents escalating the situation and they called me to call me names and say I have to help him as he is \"family\". To make matters worse, my brother is married and has two children with his wife, but he doesn't have any money saved because he doesn't know how to stop spending. Without a well paying job he will lose his home and end up homeless as our parents currently live in another country. I have a lot of contacts at my company, I could certainly help you, but I don't feel the slightest desire to help an incompetent, entitled, asshole person.
