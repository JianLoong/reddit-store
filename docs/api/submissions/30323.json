Frankly, it feels emotionally and financially abusive as well.  Consult an attorney, and consider making a plan to separate from your wife. Seeing as she is the only income earner, maybe you can even get alimony from her.  I think it would be very important to do this while they are gone so if the attorney advises certain things then you have time to do them without their knowledge or interference.
