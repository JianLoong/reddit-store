My wife, my sister, my sister's kids, and my sister's boyfriend.  When I questioned why I wasn't invited my sister rolled her eyes (passive aggressive as always) and my wife said that since I didn't have a form of income that I wouldn't be able to afford it, but they know that if I had enough time in advance I could've lent money from my mother, which is why I suspect they hadn't told me sooner but they say they just decided.\n\n   I told them that it was completely unfair to go on a trip now that I have no money and never before when I could've come too. My sister loudly, i assume to embarrass me (this was in the front yard), implied I wasnt trying hard enough to get a job even though I have been trying and even louder told me not to go begging to mom. My mother doesn't mind lending me money she usually says don't even worry about it,  and I think they left it to now because she doesn't make a lot so if I need to borrow that much i need to let her now a couple months in advance.\n  \n  I asked my wife if I could get some help from her if I could get the plane ticket covered by my mother, and she insisted she couldn't despite her large savings account (it was over 10k last year) so now I'm thinking they just don't want me there and I got upset and here's where I may be the asshole I said maybe if she wasn't covering half the bills while my sister is not paying appropriately for her children's power and water usage she'd have the extra.\n\n  My sister blew up and screamed at me for what was probably minutes, calling me a loser and a bum and many other hurtful things and said that if angry about whos using what i can pay the bills for the 2 weeks they are gone, despite me obviously not having the income to.

Did you and your spouse not have conversation about finances and what ifs when you get together?", "It is understandable that you would feel upset and left out when your sister and wife plan a trip without you and expect you to pay bills that, by their account, would otherwise be paid by them. However, the way you expressed your frustrations to your sister and wife may not have been the most constructive or effective way to address the issue. It is important to communicate openly and calmly about financial concerns and to work together to come up with a solution that is fair and equitable for everyone involved. It may be worth discussing potential compromises or alternative plans with your sister and wife, instead of resorting to hurtful comments or accusations. Ultimately, finding a way to communicate effectively and work through conflicts in an open and respectful manner is key to maintaining healthy relationships", "NTA.  This is so effed up on so many levels I don't even know where to begin. So your wife, your sister, her kids and your sister's bf are going but you're excluded?  Because you don't have income at the moment and \"can't afford it?\" Despite the fact that your wife has a sizeable income and could therefore easily afford to cover your expenses?  That's what spouses do ; when one is having a hard time with something (in this case, you being unemployed, through no fault of your own), one carries the other.  I'm sure at some point in time the situation will be reversed, if it hasn't been already.  I hate to say it but it sounds like your wife is married to your sister rather than to you.  And not just necessarily a job loss ; if your wife were to experience an extended illness you would be expected to be there for her just like she should be there for you now.  It sounds like your wife's income is sufficient that you can live on your own and you ought to consider that.  It seems very curious that your wife was so insistent on moving in with your sister.  It seems like she and your sister enjoy ganging up on you.  I bet that one is influencing the other with gossip about you \"not looking hard enough for a job,\" etc.  I think your wife and sister need to be apart.", "Your wife is the absolute worst, she is not supportive at all, divorce her and use your unemployment to make her pay alimony, she is already one foot outside the marriage.
