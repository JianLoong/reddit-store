Tess is currently in the process of divorce from Steven (30m). Tess and Steven have two young children (19mo and 4yrs). \n\nPrior to the divorce, Tess confided in me that 7 months prior she had met another man, Gary, and they had been going to the gym together to spend time alone. I told her that I didn\u2019t think this was a great idea to spend time with this person. Tess justified that it was just friendship, and she would not act on her feelings. \n\nNew AP Gary also happens to be her mother\u2019s partners son. So kind of step brother. They weren\u2019t raised together which is a positive I guess.\n\nI had my doubts, as 3 years prior she had an affair with an older man. She also once proudly came to my house flaunting her then affair partner on FaceTime. Please also note that my husband Ryan (34m) has also been friends with Steven for about 13 years. I found it incredibly weird at the time that she was flaunting her affair and told Tess I didn\u2019t appreciate her putting us in a position where we are expected to hide her secret. I tried to give benefit of the doubt, as she was suffering post partum depression, and I know it can manifest in strange ways. \n I told Tess that I didn\u2019t agree with her hanging out with this guy, and it wasn\u2019t fair to her husband. It was also pretty morally wrong. Tess then goes on to talk about her husband in a pretty negative way. Saying he isn\u2019t a good father, he doesn\u2019t do enough around the house, etc. From knowing Steven, from my perspective he has a wonderful relationship with his children, always engaging with them and playing. For the housework, I can\u2019t comment. Regardless, you shouldn\u2019t have an affair when you\u2019re married. Please know this is the first I had heard of her having any issues with him in 8 years of marriage. \n\nTess then decided I was being judgemental of her situation, and stopped speaking to me. But she thought it would be a great idea to message my husband \u201cI slept with Gary today, don\u2019t tell OP\u201d. My husband told me as soon as he received the message, as he thought it was a weird message to get from one of my friends. I asked Tess to respect my boundary of not discussing her extra marital sexual escapades with my husband, and she didn\u2019t take it well. Said I was being a judgemental friend and she wanted to tell someone. I argued she could have told literally anyone else. \n\nTo me, this behaviour comes across as saying \u201cmy legs are open if you want\u201d. \n\nOnce Tess finally ended her marriage, she began her relationship with Gary publically. What also rubs me wrong is she hasn\u2019t been a great mother during this process of affair and divorce. I\u2019m talking letting her kids eat last nights dinner off the floor for breakfast the next day. She\u2019s also talking about how she scored a \u201crich young guy with a sick millionaire dad. \n\nI can\u2019t watch it anymore and ended the friendship.

You were clear about your boundaries and not wanting to be put in the middle since you and your husband are also friends with her partner.  She didn\u2019t respect that.

She\u2019s gleefully spraying her affair into other peoples faces. It\u2019s self-destructive and selfish and self-centred but she\u2019s hurting multiple people and you\u2019re enabling it by not telling her straight how despicable she\u2019s being to her children. It sounds like she\u2019s always been this gross, maybe you just weren\u2019t paying attention.

I recently accompanied my friend during her child custody hearing and an affidavit and witness testimony from one of her husband\u2019s friends really made a HUGE impact on the judge\u2019s decision. He was able to speak calmly and concisely about very specific conversations he had with the ex husband regarding the children. (The ex even told this guy that his eldest, a 9yr old daughter, was his \u201cenemy\u201d which is why he was so strict with her.)\n\nMy friend\u2019s ex had sued her for 50/50, because she was following their separation agreement of every other weekend and one week night dinner and he wanted more time because that\u2019s what \u201cgood dads\u201d do. Thanks to this affidavit and testimony along with nearly a dozen other affidavits from friends/family, my friend was granted majority physical custody in a very strong 50/50 state.", "NTA this person git a taste of chaos and is now addicted, black them out before you gst sucked in further", "NtA.  Sounds like she did everything to get caught cheating.", "NTA. Tess isn\u2019t your friend, telling your husband that she has sex with someone else and not to tell you was an attempt to break up your marriage (as well as hurt her husband). Hoping he either keeps it secret and she tells you later about \u201ctheir\u201d secrets, or he takes her up on her off er to have a turn.\n\nIf you stay friend the what happens the next time you annoy her, will she do the same again? What if she lies and publicly claims that your husband came onto her? You end up looking like a fool for taking back a \u201ccheating\u201d husband even if nothing happens.\n\nNo good person with two kids would deliberately break up their family with a public affair. Even if they felt they needed to escape they\u2019d want to avoid the acrimony so co parenting was as easy as possible.
