That's a very unrealistic expectation and not at all fair to you. Federal minimum wage is $7.25 and many states ARE higher, so yes you could literally do better under any standard employment.\nOh, NTA.", "NTA - that pay is not even close to minimum wage. Plus, that's more hours than most adults work full time. You should not take a job that pays that poorly. Do not feel guilty for the mom's situation.", "NTA\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I\u2019d offer to work a day or two at a rate you\u2019re comfortable with. $150 for a whole week is criminally cheap, I\u2019d think it\u2019d be closer to $150 per day. It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll take you up on it, but maybe down the line she\u2019ll want a day off and you might be able to fill in for a fair price.\n\nNTA", "50 some hours a week for 150?    NTA NTA NTA.   that's like....3/hour?  or less, actually.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless you're getting some massive bonuses you're not telling us about (rent, food, and more besides!), you'd be a food to do that.   Can you bring this kid on a side hussle?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n600/month is NOT worth doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA NTA NTA", "NTA. . . shes not even offering you $3/hr for a 6 day a week high liability job. You should be seriously insulted.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed to talk about a job with a potential employer. You got a better offer elsewhere. You decided to go with the better offer. That's how it works. So long as you tell the single mother that you're not going to be able to work with her, you're fine.", "NTA.  52 hours a week.  Less than $3 per hour?  At $520 a week it would still be a low-ball offer.  Saturday alone is worth as much as M-F, if they want to control your time.", "NTA the hours is to long and to little money. If you have better job offer I don't see why you can't go for better job you don't own her anything.", "Absolutely NTA. That pay is ridiculously low. She should be ashamed of herself.  That\u2019s a little over $3/hour.", "There's really no conflict here to judge. That is how jobs work.", "NTA. This is how work works.", "NTA. Job situations change. Let her know what\u2019s going on and move forward with your life.", "NTA. You don't owe any potential employer any guilt for taking a better job. Even if you previously showed interest. Just explain to her that something else came up and you will be accepting a different opportunity.\n\nAlso, $150 for the amount of work she expects is absolutely way too low. I get it's hard to find affordable childcare, but that does not need to come at your expense.", "NTA - you deserve to take the job that makes the most without feeling guilty. I would say that agreeing to discuss the babysitting job with her would be leading her on, so don\u2019t feel bad about that. Her pay would have been equivalent to $2.60/hour which is far below minimum wage in any state and you deserve fair compensation for your work regardless of the position.", "8.5 hours per day, 6 days per week means 51 hours per week.\n\n$150 / 51 hours = $2.94 / hour.\n\nIf she complains, tell her that the wage was crap, and you found something better.\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA.

You talked about it, found out how horrible it was, and when you meet with her, decline based on your other option which will also give you the kind of job experience you can put on a resume. Babysitting will suck up all your time and patience for extremely low pay and lots of employers don\u2019t consider these informal arrangements to be \u201creal\u201d experience. 150 a week for 6 days a week is less than what you would pay a family member.  25 bucks a day for 9 hour days?

I'm a childcare provider (10 years)  and technically won't \"babysit\" anymore. But when people ask, I tell them I charge what I make at my day job and that shuts them down pretty quickly. I hope you land the other job!", "$150 for 6 days? Wtf? She's not going get anyone for that amount unless they are completely undervaluing themselves.

There is no need for further communication.  She tried to play you \n\nI\u2019m a working mom myself. I think she\u2019s playing a dangerous game - trying to get someone to babysit for such long hours over a long week for an absolute pittance - when that person is going to be caring for your valuable children ? \n\nPlease don\u2019t concern yourself about her feelings.
