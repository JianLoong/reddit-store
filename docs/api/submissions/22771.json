It's no different than putting them through the washing machine, which is often done to remove dust mites etc. And if someone is doing something weird but not harmful... so what?\n\nHowever, you made a quick unilateral decision based more on your judgment that it is weird than any actual danger of growing mold. If it had been about the mold, you could've put them in the dryer on high heat or, I dunno, TALKED TO HER ABOUT IT.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Put them in the dryer yourself if the wet toys bother you. I don't understand what you're \"taken aback\" by. Do you think she's cheating on you with stuffed toys? It is none of your business.

All you had to do is run them through the bedding cycle in the washer and dryer.", "LOL YTA you threw away her things that\u2019s ridiculous. Tell her to like wash them properly don\u2019t just throw them out which will obviously cause a problem that you\u2019re somehow surprised about?", "YTA my daughter (20f) has a bunch of these. And yes these are common emotional items.  You didn't even give her a chance to clean them.  I am allergic to mold as well, however.....", "YTA. Things don't get covered in mold the second they get wet. It takes being damp and unclean for a while. Put them in the dryer and the problem is solved. You stole from your wife.", "squishmallows are generally and primarily huge comfort items, right?\n\na partner who throws them out for \"their needs\" sounds like a major red flags, like you need to eradicate her sources of joy, because her being independently happy without your permission upsets you.\n\nShe's not making you interact with them or the supposed mold. There are discussions about cleaning them etc to keep you both healthy.\n\nSo is the real reasons that you don't like her to have something that makes her feel good? Especially if you have no control over it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nALSO\n\nWere you 19 yo last year? How did you age 5- years in the span of a year?", "I mean, you definitely could\u2019ve cleaned them for her and talked her into staying clean like that but idk", "YTA. Wow, I gotta say wow at the absolute disrespect. Ask yourself, is this really about the squishmallows?

Just make sure they get clean", "YTA, why do you care so much she has them in the first place?

Life sucks and you do whatcha gotta do to survive.\n\nYTA.\n\nRedditor's are usually too quick to shout for divorce but honestly if my hubby threw my comfort item out, I'd divorce him.

She says this is for her mental health, and it is not my place to question that. You could have helped her clean them, started the load of laundry, had a conversation about replacing them, or one of 15 other easy solutions, but you threw away items she clearly cared about.\n\nNow, is mold unhealthy? Yes. Of course. But wet doesn't automatically or immediately mean mold. And if she knew they got moldy (from sitting in the sink for a while or something) and we knew her perspective, we might have enough info for a different opinion. \n\nBut really, like a lot of things, it comes down to communication. Just talking about it can solve lots of little problems before they become big problems. I don't think either of you really respected the other in this interaction.", "It\u2019s harmless but what the fuck", "YTA.  Are you going to pay her back for the property you stole?", "YTA\n\nThey weren\u2019t moldy yet.  She\u2019ll probably done this before and you had no idea because they were fine.  \n\nTalk rationally about your concern but don\u2019t assume.  Yes have her make sure properly dried but don\u2019t throw them out!  See if you can get some towel animals intended to get wet safely.", "Yta you didn't throw them in the dryer, why?\n\nHave fun when she tosses your shit for being in her way.", "YTA.

You threw them on purpose. You are making her crazy. I\u2019d separate from you for doing that.", "YTA. You act like they definitely have mold, but that's super unlikely if they are drying in the tub. Plus, you threw away items that didn't belong to you.", "So chemist expert here, things that happend are strange for sure but let me tell you one thing. In a bath the skin cells from your body, well they go inside the fabric of these toys. Also, there relative size and polymer composition would not allow for perfect drying and such. They would remain damp and would indeed get mouldy. With an allergy to mould this is basically like filling your house with flowers when dating a person with a pollen allergy, jesus. You are in fact not the asshole and humping plushies in a bathtub is cunfusingly distubing to imagine. Many types of mould could gladly feed of the residual dead skin cell particles just using the general humidity of the house itself. OP, don't let others get to you. Toss em if she does it again lmao.", "God you're a dick, but I understand where you're coming from. Some stuffed animals do not properly dry out after soaking like that, and mold is 100% a believable concern.\n\nBut you TALK about concerns like that. You find a solution that doesn't involve throwing away things your partner cares about. There are a lot of ways to get around the mold issue, and this was by far the most insensitive to your partners feelings. YTA, OP. Put in the effort to be kind to your SO.", "ESH.

You're seriously asking if it's ok if you just threw away your wife's stuff without asking when you knew that would make her upset?\n\nThis is one of those posts where people basically say \"Hey, I was a huge asshole, so am I an asshole?\" You know the answer.

You owe your wife squishmallows, a warm bath and an apology!", "Did you ever stop to consider that your confronting her is the reason they didn't go into the dryer immediately? You come home early, make a big deal out of something that, while a little weird really isn't a big deal and then you have the audacity to throw away her things. \n\nLet me ask you op, you say you're allergic to mold and she's bathing with \"molding\" smashmellows, yet you only knew of her doing this because you came home early. So it stands to reason that your wife was doing exactly what she said, drying them right after. My question is why did you immediately rush to throw them out? Why not speak to her about them still being wet? Why not have an adult conversation?\n\nInstead your stole and threw away her property and you're shocked she's mad at you?? You owe her an apology and a replacement of her stuff\n\nYTA", "YTA. They were not yours to throw away.  You owe her an apology and replacements.

This wasn\u2019t a one time thing.", "They are stuff toys, wash and dry them Good grief YTA for thowing her stuff way.", "People fudge their ages for anonymity here all the time. That's quite normal.", "It\u2019s like taking a shower with socks. Is it weird? Yes. Do you have questions? Also yes. Is it hurting anyone else? No! Let them enjoy their soppy socks showers and move on.", "It's quirky. I can imagine the specific type of adult who has so many squishmallows that when confronted her reply is 'it was only three.'. Now, OP finds this personality attractive and married her so she shouldn't be surprised she's doing things with her MULTIPLE STUFFIES. \n\nESH btw. She should have dried them. When she didn't OP should have. Tada.", "It could be hurting someone if they become moldy and trigger an allergic reaction.  But they were _not_ moldy and they did _not_ trigger an allergic reaction.  So OP is TA for letting the anxiety win."]}
