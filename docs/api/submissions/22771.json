I wouldn\u2019t call someone asshole just because they forgot to do something they said they would once- unfortunate timing yes but surely not malicious. Unless it\u2019s a repeated then it\u2019s no longer a mistake but deliberate.

I dont have baths with them or anything (even if I did my hubby would think it's weird but wouldn't throw them away). Besides, some squishmallows or jellycats etc can be collectibles and quite a good investment. In this situation if them being moldy was bugging me then I'd wash them for my other half. If somethings annoying you like something being untidy then tidy it! Doesn't matter if you didn't do the mess! That's a sign of adulting correctly. We all make mistakes though so if I were you I'd apologise and tell her next pay check you're taking her on a squishmallow shopping trip!", "If my partner would threw away one of my plushies, he could not only sleep on a couch but in a complete new house. Depending on which plushie, he could stay there. Why? Because he knows full well that they are important to me and he doesn't judge me for them (like any good partner should do?). Be honest: you were not afraid of the mold. You were looking for a reason to get rid of them. I wonder why your wife never told you about them? Could it be because you are a judgemental ahole? \nYTA", "Whilst it\u2019s not good for either of your health, it wasn\u2019t a good move to just bin them! \nSimple solution though, apologise and buy her some new ones.", "YTA", "YTA, and Yikes.\n\n>and found her in the bath with three Squishmallows.

She's taking baths with *wet* squishmallows. A soft toy doesn't grow mold as soon as it gets wet. They can be easily washed and dried...\n\nClearly this has been going on for a while, clearly it's not been a problem thus far because she washes and dries them.\n\nI think... You need therapy. And you might need to consider WHY your wife claims:\n\n1) she needs to take care of her mental health in this way (i.e. is it a coping mechanism for something?)\n\n2) are YOU the source of, or contributing to, a decline in her mental health.", "Agree, I did some summer washing with all the pillows, comforters, blankets and so on. The weather was suppose to be sunny so I planned to dry them outside. Well.. rain happened so it took an extra two days to get everything dry again. Obviously that didn't hurt them!

OP simply hated the wife have \"me time\", so OP took revenge on the toys.\n\nPut them in the dryer if they are wet. Then talk to the wife.

If she fear the mold, she should be happy the wife will sleep in a different bed. I mean, this mold-human was literally submerged in a mold infested water! Why should OP touch her?\n\nBecause she and the plushies are not mold infested.\n\n2) This is the first time she catched her. There was no second chance for the wife, it was an ultimatum.

YTA. All the way. \n\nNow, if I were you, I\u2019d go buy her some more squishmellows, have a bath ready for her one night, and help her pick out the ones she wants to bathe with.

Sorry but my true opinion.", "Info: what was she doing with them?\n\nWas it sexual? Did you get jealous of them? \n\nYTA as you shouldn\u2019t bin peoples property without discussing it with them.
