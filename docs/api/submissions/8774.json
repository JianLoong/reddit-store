I look and sound just like my mom and my family has resented me for years in odd situations-- I feel, because of this. \n\nI was a successful EMT for years and am pursuing a career in chaplaincy. I have a lovely home, two degrees, a big dog and a gorgeous husband. Our baby is MASSIVE and i'm a short lady.\n\nI had contractions when i found out about my sister.. it was very unexpected. I was still on rest at our home in VA (I call often to keep everyone updated but family is in Florida). I was building the daughter's nursery when I received a youtube link without warning or context. without thinking, I opened it to find a FULL cesarean delivery video. It was like watching a car accident in slow motion, there was LOTS of blood and i'll spare the details. I couldn't look away before I threw up on myself\nuncontrollably, embarrassing and causing more tears and contractions. My husband came home from work at a normal time unknowing & shortly after this I explained why I was crying and cleaning vomit when he asked and ofcourse he was FURIOUS. though he calmed me and helped me distract. i love this man. \nOn Saturday, I held my composure long enough to call my dad and ask simply if he knew of the video that had been sent -- hoping he could help me understand where she was coming from because we just couldn't. He didn't know-- was upset and shocked, also spoke with her it seems. \n\nI woke to a group text of her and my father, she defended herself saying her mom was alive and not present for her c sections- she wished she had someone to be there for her. I have called many times, this is the third time I have heard from her my entire pregnancy. \n\nI apologized for the confusion and haven't spoken to her since.\n\nI did not speak to my step mom in over a year before i got pregnant, my father talked me into welcoming her back into our lives as he refused to visit me while pregnant without her even when my kidney failed.\n\nany clarifying questions will be answered in the comments. \n\nTL;DR \nmy fathers wife has been insensitive and defensive of sending a graphic video shortly after my sister died.. my husband and I don't want her near our daughter as this is a pattern.

It sounds as though you and she have always had a rocky relationship if you didn't talk to her for a year before becoming pregnant, and your dad had to convince you to have a relationship with her again.  The problem is going to come when your dad wants to see your daughter but refuses to come without his wife.  You'll get so much guilt from everyone.
