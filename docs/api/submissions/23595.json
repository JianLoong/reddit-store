I'm betting this isn't the first time you and your sister have been at odds with each other, and your parents should definitely be more proactive in helping her get help.", "nta\n\nshe STOLE from you! mental health issues don't give you the license to steal from your anyone let alone family. She didn't even apologize...\n\nyou are correct that she abused your trust. she should have at least TRIED to apologize even through text.\n\nthe fact that you feel bad for calling out her behavior indicates that she knows she can do this kind of stuff and that you lot will forgive her. As you said, nothing you or your parents do will \"do anything\" in regard to her behavior. She needs serious help, because one day you will not be the one she needs to apologize to, and they will not be nearly as forgiving.\n\nedit: changed some phrasing/grammar\n\nedit 2: unpopular opinion but I don't think this was necessarily public shaming if the only other people in the gc are the parents. they need to understand how they are letting both of their children down. not sure if there were other siblings in the gc (if there were then yikes bad call).", "Just some advice...you need to run your business better. You should have known that there was missing money. Know your inventory and know how much you sell. If it dosent equal out, something is amiss. Also, yta for cleaning her room in the first place? Why? You know she won't appreciate it.", "NTA, you didn't publicly shame her, if she's stealing that's a household issue and inormed the household..lets take the family part out of it. Imagine if you lived with 3 roommates and one was stealing. You'd have to let the others know. And text would be the best way to do so, because then there's a written trail and no one can twist your words later,and you can include pics. \n\nI suggest you get a key for your room, and a fridge lockbox for your baking business.", "NTA, she did the crime, you had her do the time!!", "I\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted but ESH.

She has stolen and taken many things from me, but stealing from my business set me off.\n\nI suffer from mental health issues and the only reason why I go to therapy now is because I pay for it myself. My parents are kinda aware? Of her situation but they don\u2019t bother with her unfortunately", "Thank you for this.. and you are absolutely correct. \nShe has stolen from me before and when I confronted her, she SH herself and came directly to me and showed me while crying, so I had to talk to her gently and help her in fear of her hurting herself more. That is why I confront her through text, but she completely ignores me. \n\nI dont know what I can do to get her the help that she needs", "I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t keeping track on my chocolate as my sister would handle those orders for me, but everything else I keep track of as I need to know what runs out and when I need to restock. \n\nI may be TA for cleaning her room but I couldn\u2019t just let my sister sleep in that bedroom, no matter how much she pissed me off. It became an actual health hazard", "Thank you! And thats true.\nI ended up having to hide my box of chocolate away which makes me sad and upset because I can no longer bake with ease knowing that my things are safe. I have to constantly keep track and check that she hasn\u2019t stole anything which is tiring", "It doesn\u2019t seem like OP is shaming her sister in the family group chat with the intention of \u201cintervening\u201d (which, I agree, would warrant an ESH). However, I think OP wants her sister to actually face consequences for lying and stealing\u2014that seems justified.", "I agree with you. Also I feel like OP going into their sisters room and just cleaning up stuff without warning also made the sister feel bad. I'd be pretty mad and somewhat insecure if someone went through my room where my private things are without my permission and potentially even threw something out that was not actally trash.", "17", "Last time I did that, she cried, S/H then showed me.

But OP said that the gc is only immediate family/family that lives in the house. I\u2019m ASSUMING the only family in the house is her and her parents and *maybe* another sibling that she doesnt mention. She\u2019s stated her parents \u201ctalk\u201d to the sister, it does nothing. OP talks to sister, it does nothing. If there was a sibling in the house to talk to OP\u2019s sister, what good would that do? What OP did was shame her in front of people that the sister *can not* avoid.", "Yep, my mom used to clean my room for me.

This behavior would be slightly more understandable from a pre-teen, but she's almost an adult. \n\nNTA. She is more than old enough to understand that negative actions have negative consequences.", "So you thought that publicly shaming her to your parents would have a better outcome?", "I do", "Yep! Exactly that. The family gc consists on me, 2 sisters and my parents. No one else. I would never post them to our extended family members, ever", "How was it a public shaming? It was a group chat with everyone living in the house?", "I honestly reacted out of anger and I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

I do want to make it clear that as much as I disagree with what you did, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person or anything, just frustrated with someone that doesn\u2019t want to get help which is completely fair. I really hope your sister gets better and that whatever she\u2019s going through stops affecting you too because it\u2019s not fair for you to deal w it too.", "It makes it sound way worse which is better for the commenters point, so of course it was public shaming.\n\n/sarcasm", "Thank you very much\ud83e\udd79! I was really upset because when I first showed the stolen items to my parents, they laughed in disappointment and went \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do\u201d. I already know that when they say that, then they aren\u2019t going to bother. They just instructed me to hide my box of chocolates away, which isn\u2019t solving the problem at all. I was so enraged because Im the only one left to suffer and they let it be", "Yeah, I understand how frustrating this *has* to be, specially from someone in your immediate family. Do you have your own room?? Is it possible to put your business things in a little affordable safe or to just get a lock for your room? I get these solutions don\u2019t seem like real solutions and they aren\u2019t because they don\u2019t deal with the root of the problem, which is your sister but atp the only thing you can do is control how much access she has to you and your things.", "Thank you for understanding \u2764\ufe0f. I do have my own room, but Im considering getting a lock box for my items as keeping them hidden wont do much. My room is a bit far from my baking area so it will be a hassle getting things", "Could you just buy a safe with a pin lock and put it in your baking area?", "I definitely can! I do have space for it, thank you so much\ud83e\udd79 I will be searching for some boxes"]}
