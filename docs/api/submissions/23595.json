That aside if your parents know how dirty her bedroom is and she suffers some mental illness then they need to step up and maybe lay some different rules down. They should consider her not letting her have company over if the room isn't kept in a better state. There almost needs to be a cleaning schedule slowly introduced by them about working on keeping her room a little cleaner. Maybe something along the lines of every Tuesday she needs to pick up any dirty clothes around the room and put into a pile or every Monday and Friday she needs to pick up a certain amount of trash or even bring her dishes down to the kitchen sink. She could even vacuum her floors every other Wednesday or something. Just any easy steps for her to take and make habit out of instead of her room needing to being spotless. Ideally there needs to be a deep clean of the room and removd the mold. Probably alsp take care of any bugs that she most likely has living in there. I would say the goal isn't to mess with her safe space but to help manage it better. I know it can be a very overwhelming thing that sometimes is easier to ignore. I know what its like living with a mental illness but I learned that simple small things make a difference. And I hope you know your job as a sibling isn't to take care of her just because she may be struggling. I wish someone would have told me that at your age. Also this comment isnt meant to come off as judgemental but as someone who has been there before (and still continues to have a big pile of laundry stacked on a chair even though it's clean haha). Also make that smart business choice and fire her as your helper.

But I don't entirely blame her.", "No , I honestly didn\u2019t expect to find anything else since I trusted her a lot ( as Ive said ) but finding the wrappers really shocked me, I didn\u2019t expect it all. I never go snooping or looking at peoples stuff because I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to do that to me. If her room was clean, then I would\u2019ve just confronted her about the stolen personal item then left", "I wasn\u2019t sure from the post\u2014did she steal cash and chocolate or just the chocolate (which, before anyone brings it up, I do understand amounts to cash for a business as it\u2019s inventory; just wanted clarification on what types of stuff the sister steals)?", "That was incredibly sensitive of you, and I\u2019m actually tearing up that you would understand that for her. You are a good sister- she sounds like she just doesn\u2019t know how to be one back.", "My kid celebrated 10 years self harm-free this month.  When she was younger, she came to me quite a few times, crying, and in need of a lot of bandages.  There were many fix'm'up sessions in our guest bathroom with the first aid kit.\n\nShe never did it to avoid punishment or consequences.  She still doesn't totally understand why she did it, other than it was the only way to feel relief.  I think I was her safe person.  Still am.\n\nI don't have to clean her up any more, so I comb and braid her hair now.  It is way nicer.", "Just chocolate as far as I know. I hope she isn\u2019t stealing money as I used to ask her to put change away for me etc.", "No Im 23\nI didn\u2019t read the full question \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think OP is an adult as she has a small business and was not in school while her sister was.", "That makes me sad.. thank you", "I struggle with mental health issues of my own, since I was around 14. So I felt bad for my sister and understood her situation with her messy room, thats why I cleaned it", "It\u2019s not enabling when it is due to mental health. There are certain things the brain trains you to, regardless of rationality. For example, fear of heights, spiders, thunderstorms, driving, or even leaving your house at all. As things get bad for me, I shut down when it comes to housework. And once I\u2019ve shut down, it becomes paralyzing to see it accumulate. I understand it\u2019s not common for most people to see in person- but it\u2019s as real as any other anxiety."]}
