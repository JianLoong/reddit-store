But regardless of how everyone gets along isn't it weird that your husband doesn't give them the ultimatum? Like why is his ex wife at his family holiday? How does that make any sense?", "NTA at all but I don\u2019t understand why you insist on your husband going. Let him stay with you and your son, invite his child from his prior marriage, and make your own traditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no reason for you to put up with that crap or to have to spend your holidays alone.", "Info: does it bother your husband or son that you don\u2019t attend?", "NTA\n\nIt's bad enough you have to see your MIL, but your husband's ex-wife? Nooo thank you.", "NTA but you and your husband need to establish your own holiday traditions that don\u2019t have you spending holidays with people who clearly don\u2019t like you or alone.  In laws aren\u2019t the only option for celebrating holidays.  Your husband needs to put his family ahead of his parents/siblings.  I don\u2019t know why you have tolerated this as long as you have.  He should have dealt with this years ago.", "NTA.  That sounds horrid. The MIL prefers the first wife, who will always be around because of the shared kid. \n\nI would plan something with friends or any family you have.  I am sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA spend holidays with people who love you. Coordinating setting people is stressful enough without adding people who don't love you.", "NTA but a bit strange that your husband hasn\u2019t done anything about your treatment", "NTA.\n\nYou will be giving her what she wants, not being there.  She's made it clear she isn't going to try at all.  It's okay for you to 'drop the rope.'\n\nAssuming your husband's child with his ex is old enough to see if MIL tries to lie about you, so that shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA. I've got to applaud you for trying for so long, frankly.\nAfter 10 years of nonsense, I think anyone in the same situation has demonstrated that they were willing and committed. \nI have been married for more than 20 years and I just ran out of excuses for why I did not want to see my husband's very small family. So, I started just telling the truth. \"They don't like me and they treat me poorly and how is that a good time was had by all? You go and enjoy yourself. Just don't ask me to keep going and pretending everything is good when its the opposite. I don't ask you to deny yourself for my sake - so you can stop asking me for that\"\nIts not the best solution to the problem but it is easy to live with. Its not like your MIL is going to create an environment where you feel welcome - not if she hasn't already in 17 years.", "NTA. 17 years of that nonsense? Sorry, you have a monster in law.", "I wish your husband had your back with this. He should put his foot down on the ex-wife being there since she's rude to you. \n\nBut no, you're NTA. Ideally, your husband should boycott the holidays to be with you, but I get that his kid is there.", "Has your husband ever confronted your MIL about her  rude and dismissive behavior? She doesn't sound kind at all. In fact the opposite.", "NTA, but I'd stop insisting that your husband go.  He shouldn't be going to hang out with people who are openly rude to you.", "It is sad that he has to chose. It hurts my heart. I don\u2019t want him to have to chose at all but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve tried for so long. Mainly by working holidays so he doesn\u2019t have to. The last two years I\u2019ve been off during holidays.", "NTA", "NTA, but your husband should be home for the holidays with you. He can visit his mom another time. Or he needs to talk with his mom and not have his ex over there for the holidays.", "NTA. You should have stopped this years ago. You should have holidays at your own house. Your husband needs to have a backbone and make holiday traditions with his wife. Your MIL prefers his ex and most likely wants them to go back together. Your husband\u2019s ex obviously still holds out hope for your husband too. Take charge. This is your life and your marriage. Start going away for the holidays. You don\u2019t have to be a martyr and suffer in silence. Your husband has had plenty of holidays with his mother, he needs to put you first.", "NTA. I've said it here many times: **TOXIC PEOPLE DO NOT GET A PASS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMILY** (or in-laws in your case).\n\nStay home and keep your mental health intact.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband should have your back. If you're poorly treated there, then \n\n1. He should have been sticking up for you this whole time\n2. As part of sticking up for you, he shouldn't go.\n\nSorry that after 17 years of marriage that your husband still doesn't have your back and can't put and hold boundaries with his rude family.", "NTA. What took you so long? Enjoy the peace, quiet and your sweet dog.", " No they are - go no contact", "Do you stop and think your husband wants to spend the holidays with you? Where is your son when your home alone? If he's with your husband does he also not want you there for holidays? I agree stop sending flowers and making any kind of extra effort but you should be spending the holidays with your son and husband.", "Info What does your husband have to say about their deplorable treatment of you?", "NTA that is his mom being TA.  Tell him he can go you and your son will stay behind because of her behavior.  Also since this is his mom r/JUSTNOMIL", "Info: Did your husband leave his ex-wife for you. Was it an affair situation?", "NTA tell your husband to go and not feel bad. It's been 17 years and you just don't want to deal with it and he understands. You're not an AH you're just tired of it.", "YTA for insisting your husband go.  He is an adult with agency.  He can decide for himself if he goes or stays with you.", "Why do you think she hates you and not just doesn\u2019t like you?", "ESH except you. Your husband is a huge asshole for letting his family treat you horribly for years. He obviously couldn't care less about you or he would have put his foot down and stood up for you long ago. He's also an asshole for choosing to spend the holidays with his ex-wife and not you. I wouldn't be surprised if he's sleeping with her and  his family knows and supports it, that's why they treat you so bad. They're hoping he dumps you for the ex. Ex is nasty to you because she wants that too. You need to open your eyes and wake up. Your husband is far from wonderful.", "NAH, except your MIL, of course. It\u2019s sad that your husband has to choose. I turn myself inside out most visits to be as welcoming to my DIL as possible because I\u2019d never want him to choose and I know I\u2019d never win.
