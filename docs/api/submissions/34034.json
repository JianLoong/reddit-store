Next time you should seriously call animal control. Also, a shelter would've ran any tags or microchips and called the owners. I hope it's still alive.....", "YTA", "YTA because, while it may not be pretty, it\u2019s soooo easy to free pallets and fix a fence.", "what you did is disgusting - you repair the fence if it means that much to you, rather than taking an innocent animal and dumping them off somewhere and taking a beloved member of the family from someone else. What you did may well be a criminal offence. \n\nNo you are not a dog person, nor are you a person with empathy\n\nYTA", "YTA, wow!!!! Contacting authorities or someone of a higher power to address the dog would have been the logical thing to do. But, you decided to not only be petty, but a major AH by taking a dog to a shelter, which is traumatizing to not only the dog but the owner. The neighbor was not being careful, sure, but calling your local police and/or code enforcement would have solved that issue.", "YTA. \n\nWhat a horrible disgusting thing to do. Yeah the dog and the neighbours are annoying but ffs, it\u2019s not like it came in and savaged your kids! It was coming in and playing! You stole the neighbours dog and \u201ctook it to a shelter\u201d which could potentially euthanise it. So you could have pretty much killed a beloved family pet all so\u2026.what?! It doesn\u2019t play in your yard!\n\nYou\u2019re vile, spiteful, deceitful and vindictive!", "I\u2019m amused by all of the people attacking you, OP.  People don\u2019t take control of their dogs or their kids, and go nuts when you\u2019re called out on it. Too damn bad for negligent entitled people who treat everyone else\u2019s property like their extended yard. \n\nIf you honestly warned them, then NTA.  \n\nIf you made it intentionally difficult to get the dog back, then YTA.", "You are a massive asshole and I hope Karma gets you good", "YTA, put up a for sale sign now, because you will never be tolerated in that neighborhood again.  Your lying about the shelter or they would have found the dog.  You've destroyed a family and possibly killed that poor animal. Biggest AH ever", "YTA If you were really so upset as to do something drastic you should\u2019ve called animal control and they would\u2019ve came out and had a talk with your neighbor.  What you\u2019ve done instead is stolen their dog dumped it at a shelter and now won\u2019t even tell them where makes you a massive ah", "You\u2019re definitely \ud83d\udcaf the @sshole!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Don't you have leash laws where you live? All you had to do is call animal control and they would have taken the dog and/or fined it's owners. Animal Control may have made more of an impression on your neighbors and they would have kept the dog leashed or in its own yard. NTA although, I have never understood why people have such fits over their neighbors' pets coming into their yard or property when they're not causing any trouble.", "So ima go against the grain and say ESH except the dog obviously but you're like the biggest asshole in this situation. Firstly from your comments you say you dropped it off at a shelter & left yet the owner hasn't been able to find it? Bullshit, that's not how shelters work. You either dumped it in the middle of nowhere or dumped the dog in the parking lot of the shelter. You're absolutely the asshole. This is a family member & you literally kidnapped it because you have the maturity and conflict resolution skills of a dead fish at the bottom of the ocean. \n\nAs a dog owner your neighbors suck simply because it's their responsibility to make sure the dog doesn't get away into anyone's yard. There are actually leashes where you plant a steel rod in the ground with a hook at the top & tie a long leash so the dog could've been free & still leashed & not gotten into your yard. So they're the a-holes for this. \n\nYou're all assholes (but you're the captain of the asshole club in general). The solution would've been 1) call the police 2) call animal control 3) have sit down with your neighbors and explain that you have children who might be afraid of the dog or even make up that they're allergic. \n\nThere were SO MANY OPTIONS and you chose the 1) the nuclear option 2) the option that WILL alienate you from the neighborhood because believe me NOBODY will think you're anything but an asshole. If you're ever in trouble, you're on your own in your neighborhood. But I bet you're one of those people who think you'll never need anyone's help. \n\nHappy fucking new year, asshole.", "If someone did that with my dog, I\u2019d probably be taken away in handcuffs\u2026.and I feel like a jury of my peers would have one person who would understand and acquit me. YTA", "Without a doubt YTA. You sound the worst version of human to exist on this planet. You could have filed a formal complaint\u2026 taking their dog to the pound is the most heartless thing I\u2019ve ever read from this sub.", "YTA.  For the reason of not telling the shelter that the dog is in fact someone's pet.  You also never called animal control which you should have done several times.  Did you ever go the hardware store and buy some boards and try to fix the hole in the fence that way, until you can afford to replace the fence?\n\nThey must not have their dog chipped because that is the first thing the shelter would do is scan it for a microchip and that is their fault.", "YTA  \n\n\nAnd you are also lucky you aren't my neighbour. If you had taken my dog, while knowing its owners due to a fault on your side of the fence.... HOLY would the police stand quickly at your door for theft....   \n\n\nYou knew this dog had an owner. You are now endangering the dog, bothering the pound and stressing out the owner.   \nNot to mention, you not allowing your children to play with a friendly dog, I think you really should look up the benefits of growing up with a dog and to people who don't.   \nWhich you are apparently one.   \nIt has social beneficials.   \nThe owners are irresponsible, big time. But that dog is 100% innocent. You taking risk with its life is on you and as disgusting as it can be.", "YTA. \n\nIf you\u2019re so worried about a dog in your yard, fix the fence. You seem pretty immature and self-centered, might be time to put on your big boy pants and act like an adult.  \n\nStop playing petty little games with living beings, you egotistical fuck.", "You stole property. You're a thief. Your TA.\n\nYou could have gone through the proper channels and let AC handle it.", "You're a huge asshole and I hope everyone in that neighborhood makes your life a living hell. You're lucky if this guy doesn't wreck your shit.", "ESH. They are irresponsible owners, but you had no right to take their dog to a shelter. If the dog is an issue, you call animal control. You do not take matters into your own hands and escalate the situation.", "Hopefully someone else adopted it and the dog wasn't put down. ESH but you're a little worse for stealing the dog and possibly putting it in a dangerous situation if the shelter is a kill shelter.", "YTA. I HATE roaming dogs. HATE irresponsible owners man's HATE the \"he just want to play\" BS. Your neighbour may be the AH managing this. \nBut escalating to potentially getting the dog killed to teach them a lesson is too much. It is a LIFE. \nI would kind of understand if you hid the dog for a few hours so your neighbour understand the danger that he may lost his dog, but straight up sending the dog somewhere where he can be gone forever is just a AH move. It's totally vengeful and spiteful.", "INFO Did you tell animal control it's their dog? Usually when they know who the owner is they give them a ticket, not take the dog. If you told them it's a stray that's a whole other story.", "YTA", "YTA. Wrong response that wasted resources for the shelter while you stole your neighbors\u2019 dog.", "I love how these throwaway accounts give so much detail it makes them incredibly identifiable. Do we really need to know you\u2019re a 37 year old Male lol", "Don't tell me.  It's a kill shelter you took it to. Right? Did you take it to a shelter in the same city/county? Yeah, you really did a bad thing. Kill shelters are run by the local municipality and they kill when they are overcrowded, like, oh right around the holidays.\n\nMassive YTA. There were plenty of steps with lesser consequences you could have chosen.", "YTA. The appropriate action would be to sue them in small claims court for money to replace the fence their dog damaged and then Replace the damn fence. Small claims costs are freaking nothing and often included in the win to be paid by the loser of the case. \n\nYou resorted to self help and in a lot of courts, that would void your claim. They were being irresponsible by not securing their dog but you are the worst neighbor. You took it too far.\n\nI also don\u2019t trust people who \u201caren\u2019t dog people\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m sure you have at least one neighbor who \u201caren\u2019t kid people\u201d but I bet they wouldn\u2019t take your kid to an orphanage for walking on their lawn and shrug their shoulders when you went looking for them. \n\nOkay that might be a little dramatic but I think what you did is also dramatic so whatever. Ok bye\u2026", "YTA. You should have called the police instead and let them talk to your neighbor about the issue. What you did was just cruel. Do you know what animal shelters do? Some of them put the animal down if no one claims them. Asshole. Shame on you!", "YTA and you will be lucky if you don't end up arrested. Legally speaking you stole his property. You did no contacting of animal control or the police, who could have forced your neighbors to comply with leash laws or repair the fence. Instead you took it upon yourself and committed a crime. You're an idiot.", "YTA. You don't like dogs, fine. But there is a difference between an annoyance and a threat with dogs. This is an annoyance. And not even a daily one. You don't state that the dog is doing any damage to your property (digging under the fence, chewing up lawn furniture) and it isn't chasing or snapping at your kids.\n\nYou could have called animal control for a loose dog, each time, and let them discuss with the neighbor. But to take the dog to a shelter, NOT inform the shelter of the owner's name, address, etc was just willfully cruel and I bet you're hoping they don't find the dog before it's adopted out to another family, or worse.\n\nI'd be expecting your residency in this neighborhood to be extremely unenjoyable from now on. Regardless of how much or little you planned to interact with the rest of your neighbors, this was a heinous act that is going to resonate for a long, long time. And unfortunately, your kids will likely bear the brunt of the negativity and freeze out/exclusion more so than you and your spouse, which is really sad for them. But hey, their dad is a dick so no one is going to want their kids to play with, host, or go over to their house.\n\nBut at least you don't have to deal with a dog you don't like on average once a month. Hope you're proud of yourself.", "YTA. You should have reported the loose dog to animal control. They would have come and ticketed him.\n\nWhen you took him to the pound, did they ask you whose dog it was? Did you lie.", "YTA. It\u2019s not that you aren\u2019t a dog person. You HATE them. You took the dog to the pound where that dog could be euthanized. You\u2019re heartless. You could tell your neighbor where it is with the caveat if it happens again, you\u2019ll call animal control who will ticket your neighbor. Your post is the ones that has disgusted me the most.", "So when your kid climbs the fence to get a ball that flew into their yard I guess CPS is getting involved.\n\nYes, it\u2019s an inconvenience. Yes it might have been ugly and cost $50 in chicken wire to make a stop-gap fence solution. But taking their non-aggressive, non-damaging pet to the pound and not telling them makes you a total asshole. Should they have properly contained their dog? Absolutely. Should you have been a better person? Absolutely.", "So you solved your problem by committing larceny? Congrats. You\u2019re a theif and a potential dog murderer. Yta. Big time.", "NTA up until you stole the dog", "YTA\n\nAnd honestly I hope your neighbors get their dog and sue you. You basically stole their dog and abandonded it at a shelter, and didn\u2019t even have the decency to tell your neighbors which shelter.", "I\u2019m a dog owner. I had a neighbor whose dog was constantly loose. Actually, 2. 1 was a goldendoodle. Obviously friendly, big goofy dog. Always getting out of their fenced yard somehow. The other neighbor had a pitbull, and they just let it roam. I don\u2019t live in the country or suburbs, but in a big city near very busy streets. My concern was for either of these sweet dogs getting hit by a car. I also observed a lot of abuse from the owners of the pitbull and their small kids. Talking kicking, hitting, etc for the dog getting loose, yet they didn\u2019t even own a leash. Another neighbor gifted them one and their dog was still out daily. I was concerned as this dog got older that it was possible he could be come aggressive from the abuse he got at home. \n\nMy husband fixed out shared fence to prevent the goldendoodle from getting in our yard. It took him 20 minutes and maybe $30. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t stop her from getting out of her yard overall. Had to eventually confront both neighbors about the issue bc I worry about their dogs. I don\u2019t feel either of them had any business having a pet, but i wouldn\u2019t have taken it upon myself to take their dog to a shelter. Call animal control next time.", "NTA. The dog is safer at the shelter. The owners keep setting it up to fail and it\u2019s solely their responsibility to keep this dog safe.", "YTA bc you punished an animal for a humans problem. Congrats on making your neighborhood hate you and probably leading to your kids being bullied about this in school. You are a huge AH.", "YTA\n\nSome shelters will immediately euthanise a large animal, they don't have facilities or budgets to look after them. \n\nIf you intended for it going to a shelter to be a warning, you F'ed up. Your neighbours still haven't located the animal, why wouldn't you tell them *which* shelter and contact info? \n\nIf you intended to simply get rid of someone else's dog, that's also just straight up awful.\n\n Even if the animal comes back safe to them, this is unforgivable. This is worth going to war over and the thing that you will have all neighbours actively turned against you for your own actions. \n\nThis is a thing that brings community together to actively hate you as an individual, you'll never be a part of the community. There is simply, no recovering from this in the eyes of many many actual normal people with feelings. \n\nNo doubt the neighbours will be more watchful if they get their dog back. But if it were my dog, lost or found, I would absolutely seek everlasting retribution and make your life a living hell while you lived there. You literally live right nextdoor to these people, there is no getting away until one of you moves.", "YTA. \n\nMy kids are scared of dogs. We just got where they don't try to climb me to get away from the 10 lb dog next door. \n\nSaid dog next door stays in our yard. Her owner let's her out and just leaves. Her previous dog got run over and I've nearly ran over this one a few times. We even have a leash law, which she told me about, but she use to be on city council and no one will force her to keep up with her dog. \n\nOur other neighbor has a husky who is fenced in but keeps getting out. I have him on camera running through my yard. Neighbor argued us up and down it wasn't his dog. Fine. \n\nAt no point have we picked up the dog and dropped him off at the shelter! Instead after the owners were talked to I told other neighbors who said dogs belonged to and they've called animal control. Because that's who you call. You do not take a living animal away from the only place they know and clearly drop it off at the entrance of a shelter and run off. \n\nDef YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. I hope your neighbors report you to the police. Tell them where you took or dumped their dog immediately. You\u2019re acting as if six times in six months is a lot. Sure, inconvenient, but did not warrant such a horrible deed like stealing their dog and risking the dog\u2019s life. Fix your mistake and get their loved one back.", "Yta what a terrible neighbor you are I feel bad for the neighborhood you moved into. Have you ever heard of animal control usually the first step before stealing a dog and taking it to the pound", "YTA. I have a neighbor with no fence and about 7 or 8 dogs, I\u2019ve truly lost count. They always found ways to get into our backyard so WE made efforts to find/fix all the areas they were getting in to make sure their dogs stay out. You know why? That dog is now on my property and if something happened to it, they could come after me. Should my neighbor make efforts to put up a fence? Sure, but we know her situation so we show her compassion. We don\u2019t take their dogs to the \u201cshelter\u201d just because they wandered into our front yard for a few minutes. \n\nYou\u2019ve also potentially caused an innocent animal to be euthanized all because you\u2019re \u201cnot a dog person\u201d. Regardless of being a dog person or not, this was definitely not the right choice. But what\u2019s more likely here is that you just dropped them in the woods somewhere, which means they could have been attacked, hit by a car, etc.. you basically sent an innocent animal to its death.\n\nIt\u2019s also not your neighbors fault that you made the choice to over extend yourself when purchasing a home. You being house poor is not their problem. If you only moved in 6 months ago, it\u2019s likely the fence was in not so great condition when you bought the home, unless a freak storm recently caused major damage. You bought this home knowing the fence would need work or need to be replaced. If it\u2019s a shared fence, I can understand them not wanting to take on the entire cost. At a minimum, the cost can/should be shared.", "YTA. Your story doesn\u2019t sound right.  IF you took the dog to the pound why didn\u2019t you tell him which one, and why wasn\u2019t the dog still there?  And even being \u201chouse poor\u201d you can buy fence slats to repair the fence.", "YTA, and you have likely committed a crime.", "NTA or soft YTA. Let it be known that I hate dogs, but it definitely isn\u2019t what I\u2019d have done if the dog is genuinely friendly (especially friendly enough for it to let you catch it and drive it somewhere). I\u2019d have started documenting when it came over and the interactions with the neighbors and filed complaints with the county or tried to force the HOA or something (I know there might not be one) to have them install and invisible fence or repair the fence on their end so the dog can\u2019t escape.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the shelter would put the dog down, but it does happen sometimes and this could still be a traumatic experience for the animal. It\u2019s also extremely dangerous that the owners let the dog wander; that\u2019s an easy way for it to get stolen (like you sort of did) or for the poor thing to get hit but a car, or for it to hurt someone if it gets scared. You gotta make sure you\u2019re punishing the owners in a way that gets them to address the issue, not victimize the dog.", "Expect every single person in that neighborhood to hate you. \n\nYou\u2019ve just ruined any chance you had of being friendly with anyone in the neighborhood. \n\nYta.", "YTA, I\u2019m not a dog person but I moved into a neighborhood where my neighbor let her old dog wander about a little. The dog was old as shit but a sweet heart and loved the kiddos playing. I dealt with her dog taking a shit in my side yard by just texting the neighbor and she would come out and clean it. Did I like that the dog wandered about a little, no, did I like that the dog shit in my yard, no, but I just texted the neighbor and told the dog to go home and she\u2019d wander her little old ass home. I looked out for the dog because the neighbors kid and the rest of the neighbors adored the old dog. I even got a small soft spot in my heart for her. I never once thought about taking that dog to the pound. Was it annoying yes, but you could have made so many different choices than the one you did.", "Yeah dude, YTA.", "YTA! You are a crappy neighbor. Check yourself.", "\"You're not dog people.\" I don't trust you folks. Something wrong with someone who hates dogs this much if you ask me.\n\nBut go get the dog now, or at least tell him where to get it. If the dog was already rehomed you can probably expect a punitive lawsuit.\n\n  \nETA Just hope your local news channel doesn't get ahold of this. Plus if your neighbor calls the cops I'm pretty sure you're going to jail.", "i don\u2019t agree that you are the ahole. This is definitely an ESH situation. those owners are incredibly irresponsible and frankly stupid. But as others pointed out you should have just continually been calling animal control, taking the dog to the shelter was extreme. animal control could handle it and it would be good to have a record of these owner\u2019s irresponsible behaviors (since none of this is the dogs fault) honestly they sound like they do not deserve a dog anyways but it still wasn\u2019t the correct way to do things.", "What a garbage response to a non issue.", "Info: Why can\u2019t the owners locate the dog? Did you take it to the nearest shelter? Did you tell the neighbor which shelter their dog is at so they can get it back? \n\nAlso you said money is tight but did you try anything to close the hole in the fence from your side or even sprinkle coffee grounds or some other homemade dog repellent in your yard to keep the dog out?", "ESH. But you're the bigger a-hole.\n\n They were rude. They were negligent. But the dog was not in danger.  \n\nYou stole the dog. You've potentially killed their dog. Or maybe you got the dog adopted by another family, and now that family going to be hurt if they have to give up the dog. \n\nRegardless, you have ruined any kind of positive neighborly relations you could have had. They were negligent. You were malicious.", "What I want to say to you would get me kicked off of here so I am just going to stick with YTA. How could you think you are not???", "YTA.\n\nLemme put this in a context you can understand, because it baffles me you even have to question your actions.\n\nI don't know if you're animal people at all, so if you are just insert whatever pet is your preference, and if you're not animal people then insert the name of one of your kids:  \nImagine your pet/kid kept going over to your neighbours garden, and they'd voiced their concerns, and the pet/kid kept going over to the neighbour, so one day they took your pet/kid to a shelter/daycare and then you couldn't find them. You'd be livid and heartbroken, too.\n\nYes, it sucks that the dog kept getting over and/or through the fence, and that your neighbours clearly weren't doing everything they could about it, but you could've handled the situation alot better.  \nYou could've called animal control, or googled what to do, or asked the police if they could have a word with the neighbour just to scare them into action a lil. I'm not claiming any one of those things is the 'right' thing to do, but would certainly be alot better than taking the dog to a shelter.  \nThis isn't a ball some kid kicked over, or a frisbee, it's a living thing that you've just uprooted from its home and must be incredibly confused and anxious being in a strange environment.   \n\n\nIf I were you, i'd apologise to the neighbour and them them which shelter you took it to before they kill the poor thing.", "YTA and a criminal. If they put the dog down, you\u2019re liable. You really picked a shitty hill to die on.", "YTA easily.", "I don't understand why you wouldn't call the non-emergency police phone number.

OP knew where the dogs owners were. Dogs that end up in the shelter end up there because people don't know where the owners are. \n\nHe stole the dog and risked its life by taking it to the pound where they may end up euthanizing it before the neighbor has a chance to find and pick it up.", "If the dog is gone for good, OP will have plenty of hell coming in the form of cops over theft of a dog and a lawsuit from the owners.", "Don\u2019t let your cat roam, someone\u2019s \u201cfriendly\u201d dog might get it.", "I had to stop watching that for a while when I had awful renters behind me.  An escape artist human agressive dog was involved, as well as a kid who was about 11 with a potty mouth.  And a mother with a potty mouth who didn't think that trespassing was a real thing, or false calls to LE.  She kept calling me in with false allegations of abusing my chickens-  she finally was told that she would be fined next time.  They finally had a \"friend\" shoot up their BBQ and they were gone three months later, right before covid thankfully.", "Have you ever heard the old adage \u201cIf it\u2019s not yours, don\u2019t touch it\u201d? This is what applies here. OP is the GIANT A because YOU CALL ANIMAL CONTROL. You DO NOT physically put an animal in YOUR VEHICLE and drive away then physically take said animal out of YOUR VEHICLE and drop it off ANYWHERE. If this was a package it would be theft. If this was a person it would be kidnapping. And btw I HATE DOGS and would never do something like this. It\u2019s so much easier to pick up the phone make a call and have animal control speak to the neighbor about keeping his animal under control. Just like if they were partying at night. Do you go over with a shotgun? No you ask politely for them to stop. Next time, you call the police for noise pollution. Gtfoh with your \u201cReddit love animals\u201d crap", "What were the other options? He told the owners (multiple times), offered solutions (fence, leash, better supervision) and the neighbours didn't do anything. It has happened dozens of times with no visible effort on the neighbour's par", "How is another family gonna take care of it? The dog hasn't been found so it's Definitely not at a shelter. I assume op either shot the dog or dropped it in the middle of the woods somewhere to die", "How is it \"theft\" if OP takes an unsupervised dog to the shelter? It's not his job to entertain the dog until the neighbour comes by and picks it up. Shelters are there to collect roaming animals, and that's what the dog was.", "Yeah no literally where im from the dog would likely have been shot after several warnings. Not saying i would but ya. Ahole dog owner was warned. And the whole point of this is that the dog was on their property. Yeah if people were partying on my property id just go out with a shotgun", ">What were the other options?\n\nWhile it is the owners responsibility to keep his dog on his property, OP also has a responsibility. Don't want other people's dogs and potential wildlife running in your yard? Better get a fence.", "OP said the dog keeps getting through the shared fence: \"It is rarely leashed and also manages to get through our shared fence.\" and that the neighbour refused to fix the fence so the dog couldn't get through. \n\nIt just seems like there werent any other options other than calling animal control, but that would have ended up with the dog in the same shelter so just one less step than what OP did.\n\nThe financial burden of the neighbours negligence shouldnt be on OP, so what were the other options that would've been fair to OP?"]}
