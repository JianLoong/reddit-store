I think/thought she was very nice and we got on well, but slowly I started noticing she was changing a lot of things, and quite quickly, and I didn\u2019t notice at first but after last night (I\u2019ll get to that) I realised she\u2019s starting to look a lot like me. She dyed her hair the same colour as mine and get extensions so that it\u2019s as long as mine. She started wearing coloured contacts the same colour as my eyes. She went from wearing patterns and bright colours to wearing the same things I do, sometimes literally the same outfit. She lost a noticeable amount of weight. She started getting her nails done in the same shape and colour as me when before they\u2019d been a totally different style. Again, I noticed she was changing but I just thought she was going for a different look. She also started following and DMing my friends on social media. \n\nLast night, I went out with some friends to a club and while there I noticed a girl wearing a dress that I used to have. She turned around, and it\u2019s Chloe. the dress is vintage, obviously the brand made more than one so she could have got it anywhere, but I routinely sell my old clothes online. I have a Depop link on my social media, and my mum sends out the parcels since most of the clothes are at her house, and something just told me that it was the same dress. With this in mind, I went over to say hi to Chloe and asked where she got her dress. She got extremely awkward and sheepishly admitted that she\u2019d bought it from my Depop. It wasn\u2019t the fact that she bought the dress, it was the combination of all the things that in that moment clicked into place while I was looking at a carbon copy of myself, wearing my old dress, and I just got extremely creeped out. \n\nI said \u201cChloe, is this some weird single white female thing, like you\u2019re actually trying to become me or something?\u201d. I was half joking, but a big part of me was feeling like I\u2019d had a major epiphany. Chloe went off on me calling me a jealous b*tch and a bunch of other things I couldn\u2019t really hear, then she started crying. Her friends went off on me as well and eventually I just went home because I felt gross.\n\nMy friends think it\u2019s all insanely weird but when I told my mum about it she said it might have nothing to do with me and that I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I saw Sebastian today and asked him about it and he said he noticed the resemblance but he doesn\u2019t think Chloe is copying *me* specifically, more that she\u2019s just making positive changes to her appearance which has resulted in her looking/dressing more like me than before.

It\u2019s very possible she\u2019s insecure about your relationship with Sebastian or that he\u2019s expressed he finds you attractive before.

You could\u2019ve maybe chosen a better time, but I think you were reacting in the moment.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily trying to take your identity and all that, but it seems she has some kind of issues regarding your and Sebastian\u2019s relationship. Heck, Sebastian even told you he found all her changes to look more like you to be a good thing. Maybe when they\u2019re together he says stuff that makes her think he wants her to be more like you.

Just blowing wind out my ass?\" \n\nI'd also rethink  your friendship, tbh. Either she's doing this because of him with his notice or he's said something that's made her feel like she's competing with you. Were you guys ever an item?", "NTA personally I would get a new haircut or dye job just to be petty because then she either copies you and proves the point or you get to keep your look for yourself but I recognize that not everyone is as chill about major changes like that lol.

I'm holding her pager and she gets a beep from a number with my fairly new boyfriend's code added, number looks familiar. It was him. She was sleeping with him, thank God that I wasn't so my feelings weren't hurt. I cut her off. I moved around the same time so didn't need to see her. She had long hair, I had a very short bob. Soon as I stopped speaking to her people came to tell me that she cut her hair like mine and it looked horrible. She was trying to be my friend a year later.

There is something mentally wrong with Chloe. \nKeep your distance until they break up.", "NTA. Even if she\u2019s innocently copying your style it\u2019s not your fault that it\u2019s creeping you out. Just keep your guard up but try to be polite.

Saw the movie. It doesn\u2019t go well.", "NTA but not a great idea to let an unstable person know you\u2019ve got their number. \n\nMy guess is she\u2019s deeeeeply codependent and is personality shopping with the person that her romantic partner most responds to.", "I would say yta but you said she is wearing contact lenses the same color as your eyes. That's what makes this extremely weird to me. Hair, clothes, nails, etc could all be chalked up to her following different trends or switching styles. But as far as I know nobody gets colored contacts unless they are cosplaying or doing a costume (at least where I live it's not normal). \n\nSo NTA. But you were kinda rude about it and could have saved the discussion for another moment. It wasn't the right scene and the way you worded it was really snarky. At the end of the day, while it's weird and unsettling, she wasn't doing anything to you and you are not the only person that can have said hair, style, etc.", "I dont know if I would have used those words per say but it is a bit weird that she is becoming you. I mean buying your old clothes? It does sounds like she looks up to you in some type of way.", "Is she trying to kill anyone or does she see you as a style icon? I feel like she won't be trying to be like you anymore.", "NTA, but I would be concerned about the girlfriend. Sebastian may have talked about you so much that Chloe felt unattractive to him, so she attempted to copy you. There is something toxic about this relationship. Stay away until they break up or tell Chloe something because Sebastian seems to be interested in you.

I completely understand why you\u2019re weirded out and how that made you say what you said. There\u2019s defo something going on here that should be seriously addressed. On the other hand, besides copying you, you didn\u2019t mention anything implying she\u2019s actively trying to harm you or attempting to being mean. She\u2019s clearly struggling with something here and you could\u2019ve talked to her in another setting and probably engage the conversation without instantly shaming her.\n\nEDIT : Didn\u2019t get that the sentence was a movie reference, which changes everything.

Yes, a little a weird given the proximity but also\u2026 she just likes your style? And in general is improving herself in multiple ways? As humans we imitate the people we admire and respect.

Maybe because she's probably slated you to them  and accused you of trying to get with her BF. \n\nI get the impression that Sebastian has mentioned he thinks your beautiful,/loves you/sees you as his girl or mentioned something that has her so insecure, she beleieves being your copy, will keep him with her.. ( he could have mentioned this meaning a purley platonic way as a friend, as in, you are one of his keep around forever friends. Not necessarily in a romantic way). \n\nShe seems to either  have such an insecurity or jealousy about you  her defence is to be you.\n\nMight be ime to have a chat with Sebastian and a very Frank and honest conversation that you are concerned for her and her mental health and your safety. \n\nChange is good, but she is literally transforming into you.  I'd also not want to be around her without a witness and block her off your social media. The less she knows about you, the better. \n\nThere was another lady on aita that had someone do similar to you. She ended up making a fake post about shaving her hair.  Her stalker saw it and did exactly the same, and when she saw her and realised she had done no such thing. She went nuts. I believe the poster had to get her university involved. \n\nDistance yourself. Log any odd behaviour and advise  Sebastian that you will need to distance from him for a while. Because this is a very real concern..", "NTA. Spoiler: You are not the jealous B. Too many changes to be like you are creepy AF. She's trying to be you and you called her out on it.", "NTA, and I\u2019m picturing the scenes from The Office when Dwight disguised himself as his different coworkers\u2026 \n\nMy money is on either Sebastian made a comment about you and see took it personally\u2026or she caught him petting the one-eyed snake while looking at pictures of you. It\u2019d cut them both out for awhile before you disappear and she completely takes your identity.", "OP, whatever you do, don\u2019t buy a puppy\u2026", "My first thought was bunny boiler even though it's the wrong movie", "NTA this is weeeeeird", "NTA, but I think you are missing something. When Sebastion said she's making positive changes, it's obvious he thinks you are more attractive. Now. Is he telling her that? Telling her how he likes your hair color, style, eyes? Maybe she's trying to hold on to her boyfriend? Gave you even tried a calm sit down with her to see whats up or did you just act like a typical girl and see her copying you are her trying to take something from you? Men can be incredibly devious about female friends", "Thank you so much. I was so confused.", "We\u2019ve never been an item, neither of us has ever asked the other one out or anything like that. I\u2019m not really mad at him because while he didn\u2019t really agree with me that she is turning into me, he was very sympathetic and he does get where I\u2019m coming from. I am going to go back and talk to him more about it though.", "Yeah, I\u2019m definitely going to talk to Sebastian again, and present some evidence, because honestly until I saw her in the dress I didn\u2019t put it all together either. If he looks at pictures of us side by side in the same outfit and he can\u2019t see that his blonde, green eyed girlfriend has literally turned into me, then we have a problem. \n\nI suppose the most logical thing is he said something that she misinterpreted, because we\u2019ve been friends a long time and never even hinted at anything more than that. But yeah, I definitely need to talk to him again.", "I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s telling her obviously but I very much doubt he was like \u201cyou know who you should look like?\u201d. I guess he could have said something like that he likes how I dress and she misinterpreted it? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to see him today to talk about it more.\n\nI haven\u2019t sat down with Chloe because firstly, I didn\u2019t really put it all together until the Club. I noticed the changes of course but I didn\u2019t realise how much she now looked like me until I saw her in my dress. Second, I don\u2019t really know her that well. Like, we talk when I see her but she\u2019s still \u201cSeb\u2019s girlfriend\u201d which is why I was even more creeped out when she started messaging my friends because she and I aren\u2019t even really friends. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s trying to take anything from me, but also, she is *literally* wearing my old clothes. She went from buying the same clothes from the shops to buying my actual clothes and that feels progressive. And if she saw the dress on my Depop why not just ask me for it and I could have dropped it off when I saw her. Why go online and buy it and have it sent as if she was hoping I wouldn\u2019t know it was her? I don\u2019t think I have a monopoly on the way I look but I do believe she is trying to look like me to a point that can\u2019t say good things about her state of mind.", "Sympathy is easy to pretend. Frankly, if I was a guy and I dated a girl that looked one way and during our relationship, she started to look more and more like my best friend to the point of buying her old clothes? I'd be some kind of weirded out. And it takes a lot of intent not to notice dyed hair, colored contacts, and the transition from (eg;) blonde with blue eyes to dark hair with green eyes. (or whatever the color change was). \"She's wearing my old clothes, wearing extensions and has my hair color, and is wearing colored contacts with my eye color. I don't know what's going on or what she's attempting, but I can tell you that I definitely do NOT like having my concerns swept under the rug because it's 'harmless'. It's not harmless. It's fucking weird.\"\n\nLike, reverse it. Ask him how he'd feel if she dated a guy that looked nothing like your bff, but over a year, the guy slowly started to try to morph into him? Same hair cut. Same clothes. Same look. Maybe even same interests. It'd be weird. It IS weird. People need to be more concerned about this.", "Hmmm, so maybe sebastion is foing the same to her? Making comments to change her appearance?", "I really hope that you and him.ca  remain friends. But it will really depend on how he responds.  A photo of her before vs her now and one of you would be a great idea. Hard to deny of its all physically in front of you. He's seen the changes over the course of the relationship. Seeing an instant comparison may be a good shock for him.", "I\u2019m going to talk to him again. I was a little wired yesterday and I just needed comfort more than anything and I don\u2019t think I got my point across too well. If after I talk to him today he still doesn\u2019t believe me then I\u2019m going to rethink things.", "Why would he not be genuinely sympathetic? \n\nLook, I get where he\u2019s coming from. I didn\u2019t notice it fully until I was in the club staring at her wearing my dress. You notice all the changes, but just notice that she looks different, but I didn\u2019t put it together that she looked like *me* until the club. I\u2019m going to see him today and I\u2019m going to show him a picture of her before and after and a picture of me, and if that doesn\u2019t do it for him then we have a problem. Because I get why he was like \u201cwell yeah she looks like you but not necessarily *like you*\u201d, but I\u2019ve got pics on her social media of her wearing similar outfits to me so I\u2019m going to show them to him side by side, and if he can\u2019t see it then I\u2019m just going to presume he\u2019s nuts.", "I mean, maybe, you never know. I doubt it but I guess it\u2019s possible. but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d tell her to buy my clothes.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery....  and you shot her down....", "Nope. This is no accident. Chloe is creepy.\n\nNTA", "NTA - My sister did the exact same thing until confronted. Copycats are so annoying.", "YTA. Buying similar clothes and having long hair with highlights is nothing special. It\u2019s just a white girl to do. Just look for pictures of Coachella.\n\nAlso, who asks \u201care you trying to become me or something?\u201d Like what kind of question is that. \n\nYou\u2019re just entitled and suffering from main character syndrome. Get over it.", "NTA The contacts did it for me. That's SWF. She can make positive changes but that doesn't explain the contacts.", "Probably stupid question....\n\nPeople would put their desired race in ads for roommates?? Like, I'm looking to rent a room to a single white female? \n\n(I've heard of the movie, and know that Single White Female equates to crazy stalker who tries to become you. But didn't know the origin of the title, never having seen the movie.)", "Yep. They did.", "Hes never going to admit anything to you, but I am willing to bet he's using backhanded compliments and comparisons to manipulate her to change. And you are willing to rank to him, but not her. He's got it made here.", "I really doubt that. He\u2019s had other girlfriends and none of them have ever done anything like this. Moreover, he\u2019s just not that kind of guy. We get along because he\u2019s hilariously upfront, he can\u2019t hide his feelings, he couldn\u2019t even keep my birthday present a secret from the lobby to the elevator. He\u2019s just not someone with enough guile or patience to get together with someone and then try to rebuild them like that. \n\nAnd to what end? In six years we\u2019ve never so much as kissed but suddenly now he wants a gf that looks like me? I don\u2019t see it.", "I doubt he's outright telling her to do it. But he got you to change your contacts didn't he?", "It's not always about wanting you, but seeing how much she can be manipulated.", "Yeah, because I looked ridiculous \ud83d\ude02 green eyes with my complexion, I looked possessed.", "Turning someone with a weaker personality into what he couldn't turn OP into maybe.", "But you didn't think so until he said so. I'm not going to try and convince you any longer, because you will never see it. So, toodaloo"]}
