I think/thought she was very nice and we got on well, but slowly I started noticing she was changing a lot of things, and quite quickly, and I didn\u2019t notice at first but after last night (I\u2019ll get to that) I realised she\u2019s starting to look a lot like me. She dyed her hair the same colour as mine and get extensions so that it\u2019s as long as mine. She started wearing coloured contacts the same colour as my eyes. She went from wearing patterns and bright colours to wearing the same things I do, sometimes literally the same outfit. She lost a noticeable amount of weight. She started getting her nails done in the same shape and colour as me when before they\u2019d been a totally different style. Again, I noticed she was changing but I just thought she was going for a different look. She also started following and DMing my friends on social media. \n\nLast night, I went out with some friends to a club and while there I noticed a girl wearing a dress that I used to have. She turned around, and it\u2019s Chloe. the dress is vintage, obviously the brand made more than one so she could have got it anywhere, but I routinely sell my old clothes online. I have a Depop link on my social media, and my mum sends out the parcels since most of the clothes are at her house, and something just told me that it was the same dress. With this in mind, I went over to say hi to Chloe and asked where she got her dress. She got extremely awkward and sheepishly admitted that she\u2019d bought it from my Depop. It wasn\u2019t the fact that she bought the dress, it was the combination of all the things that in that moment clicked into place while I was looking at a carbon copy of myself, wearing my old dress, and I just got extremely creeped out. \n\nI said \u201cChloe, is this some weird single white female thing, like you\u2019re actually trying to become me or something?\u201d. I was half joking, but a big part of me was feeling like I\u2019d had a major epiphany. Chloe went off on me calling me a jealous b*tch and a bunch of other things I couldn\u2019t really hear, then she started crying. Her friends went off on me as well and eventually I just went home because I felt gross.\n\nMy friends think it\u2019s all insanely weird but when I told my mum about it she said it might have nothing to do with me and that I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I saw Sebastian today and asked him about it and he said he noticed the resemblance but he doesn\u2019t think Chloe is copying *me* specifically, more that she\u2019s just making positive changes to her appearance which has resulted in her looking/dressing more like me than before.

It\u2019s very possible she\u2019s insecure about your relationship with Sebastian or that he\u2019s expressed he finds you attractive before.

You could\u2019ve maybe chosen a better time, but I think you were reacting in the moment.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily trying to take your identity and all that, but it seems she has some kind of issues regarding your and Sebastian\u2019s relationship. Heck, Sebastian even told you he found all her changes to look more like you to be a good thing. Maybe when they\u2019re together he says stuff that makes her think he wants her to be more like you.

The colored contacts and hair should have been a flag on its own, but man... I don't know. If I were invested in this, I'd take pictures of her that match some of your old looks and then put them side by side and be like \"Yeah, I'm just making this up, right? Just blowing wind out my ass?\" \n\nI'd also rethink  your friendship, tbh. Either she's doing this because of him with his notice or he's said something that's made her feel like she's competing with you. Were you guys ever an item?", "NTA personally I would get a new haircut or dye job just to be petty because then she either copies you and proves the point or you get to keep your look for yourself but I recognize that not everyone is as chill about major changes like that lol. But real talk you said you said it in a half joking manor and she could\u2019ve laughed it off and denied the claim but her reaction made it a huge deal.", "It\u2019s one thing if she\u2019s going through a style change, tbh that\u2019s around the age I came into my current style.

I bought some boots no one had....month later, she had them. Ok, cool. I bought a neon First Down bubble coat, few week later, she had the same one. WTH! I'm holding her pager and she gets a beep from a number with my fairly new boyfriend's code added, number looks familiar. It was him. She was sleeping with him, thank God that I wasn't so my feelings weren't hurt. I cut her off. I moved around the same time so didn't need to see her. She had long hair, I had a very short bob. Soon as I stopped speaking to her people came to tell me that she cut her hair like mine and it looked horrible. She was trying to be my friend a year later.

There is something mentally wrong with Chloe. \nKeep your distance until they break up.", "NTA. Even if she\u2019s innocently copying your style it\u2019s not your fault that it\u2019s creeping you out. Just keep your guard up but try to be polite.

Saw the movie. It doesn\u2019t go well.", "NTA but not a great idea to let an unstable person know you\u2019ve got their number. \n\nMy guess is she\u2019s deeeeeply codependent and is personality shopping with the person that her romantic partner most responds to.", "I would say yta but you said she is wearing contact lenses the same color as your eyes. That's what makes this extremely weird to me. Hair, clothes, nails, etc could all be chalked up to her following different trends or switching styles. But as far as I know nobody gets colored contacts unless they are cosplaying or doing a costume (at least where I live it's not normal). \n\nSo NTA. But you were kinda rude about it and could have saved the discussion for another moment. It wasn't the right scene and the way you worded it was really snarky. At the end of the day, while it's weird and unsettling, she wasn't doing anything to you and you are not the only person that can have said hair, style, etc.", "I dont know if I would have used those words per say but it is a bit weird that she is becoming you. I mean buying your old clothes? It does sounds like she looks up to you in some type of way.", "Is she trying to kill anyone or does she see you as a style icon? I feel like she won't be trying to be like you anymore.", "NTA, but I would be concerned about the girlfriend. Sebastian may have talked about you so much that Chloe felt unattractive to him, so she attempted to copy you. There is something toxic about this relationship. Stay away until they break up or tell Chloe something because Sebastian seems to be interested in you. This situation sounds like a whole creepy movie where the husband is slowly turning his current wife into his dead wife.", "NTA.

I completely understand why you\u2019re weirded out and how that made you say what you said. There\u2019s defo something going on here that should be seriously addressed. On the other hand, besides copying you, you didn\u2019t mention anything implying she\u2019s actively trying to harm you or attempting to being mean. She\u2019s clearly struggling with something here and you could\u2019ve talked to her in another setting and probably engage the conversation without instantly shaming her.\n\nEDIT : Didn\u2019t get that the sentence was a movie reference, which changes everything. NTA.", "ESH\n\nThis whole situation is strange.", "[deleted]", "I think comparing her to a literal stalker/murderer was where you went too far.

Yes, a little a weird given the proximity but also\u2026 she just likes your style? And in general is improving herself in multiple ways? As humans we imitate the people we admire and respect.
