TO my left, there was a young girl, roughly 12 I\u2019d say. She had her head down, not looking up at anyone .To her left, was her Mum. She had sat herself slightly further forward than her daughter.\nWe began with an ice breaker, going clockwise in a circle. When we got to the young girl, she didn't introduce herself, at the time I thought it was due to being anxious/nervous. Then mum piped up \"My name is Karen (Not her real name) As you can see my Daughter suffers with Down's Syndrome and she suffers bullying every day. It MUST stop\u201d.\nThe tone was set.\n\nTo kick off the meeting one of the younger kids from another school had the idea of installing \"Drop Boxes\" in schools, where Children could report grievances. \n\"My daughter struggles with writing on her own, you\u2019ve put little thought into how this affects her\"...\nLater on a child recommended a Gala to raise awareness \"How can my daughter partake, she has limited mobility and struggles to partake in group activities, how short sighted of you\".\nThis went on for nearly an hour.\nEvery time Karen spoke, I could see her daughters face grimace. I knew that face, she felt belittled, upset, powerless. So I tried to get her involved in the conversation \"I'm sorry, I never got to know your name, would you like to have a say?\u201d \"How dare you, do you have any idea how much she struggles every day and you try and throw her in the spot light, to give her an anxiety attack, I thought this was an Anti-Bullying meeting yet none of you seem to understand what Bullying really is!\"\nI stood up from my seat and my voice carried so loud the entire cafeteria fell silent enough to hear a pin drop.\n\"Your Daughter sits there in your shadow while you constantly repeat over and over again how 'unable' she is. You've not once spoken about her in a positive light, to her you are a contestant vocal reminder of her disability, a disability that you constantly perpetuate and have done so for the last 60 minutes\".\nIt fell silent. Karen got up. Grabbed her daughters hand and stormed off to the exit.\n \"I will be telling everyone about the bullies running the so called Anti-Bully group at this school, I'll be sure all of you are reprimanded for this\". \n\nI don't have a child, let alone a child with any form of disability. I DON'T know how hard it can be. So part of me wanders \"Did I approach it all wrong? Was I the asshole?\".

You should be proud of yourself. It can difficult for children to stand up to adult bullies. That woman was clearly projecting.", "NTA - you handled that quite well and you should be proud of yourself for trying to run such a great scheme while people like that constantly bring you down.", "NTA. Oh thank you for what you did, so much, really. I dont have down syndrome, so i dont know how this feels like, but i have my own problems. thanks nature i have supporting parents, but i went to school and had a teacher who used to always talk over my head and behind my back with ppl about my (in her thought) diabilities, in the end 90 percent of what she said was a lie. Not everyone with problems are good in standing up for themselves, but its so tiring and frustrating if some ppl just decide to be your mouthpiece (dont know if this makes sense in english). \n\nThis anti bullying group would have been a chance for the girl  to build up courage and trust in someone else, a group where she can be heard about what she truly thinks, her mother just took this chance away.", "NTA.  I can see why some people in the meeting, especially that parent might think you were being an ass but you were standing up for this girl better than their parent was.  You told the mom to stop being ableist and that took some guts.  Hats off to you!", "NTA. This woman need to realize that she is her daughter\u2019s worst bully", "NTA, she really needs to get a grip. I used to work in a facility that takes care of young adults with various disabilities and it's where I learned that giving them their own will makes them so much stronger. Of course, they have it hard and can't do everything on their own, but they WANT to! this mother doesn't sound like she ever gave her daughter a chance so of course she struggles more than other children. No matter what disability someone has, they're not stupid, they remember the things people say about them.", "You're NTA. You said it perfectly. If only you'd had time to point out that woman was trying to bully the entire group as she shot down and belittled every idea someone suggested. She sounds like a miserable person who uses her daughter's problem to spread her misery.", "YTA, albeit a well-meaning one.  You clearly do not have a good understanding of this girl\u2019s condition, because Down Syndrome (not Down\u2019s Syndrome) is not just a learning disability, it is a more extensive condition that includes intellectual disability, the extent of which can vary widely.  In addition, many people with Down Syndrome experience speech impairment, and some lose their ability to speak entirely as they get older.  \n\nThere is a lot more to Down Syndrome, but what this comes down to is that you have no idea what her abilities are, bit you charged into the situation and put her on the spot in a context where she may have been unable to respond the way you were looking for and may have needed her mother to speak for her.  If that\u2019s the case, then you just became one more person contributing to her bullying and ostracism. \n\nIf you had issues with the way the mother was speaking for her daughter, the appropriate course would have been to talk to them separately during a break or something to get to know them and understand the daughter\u2019s condition and her ability to engage in a group discussion before putting her on the spot and potentially humiliating her.  It might have also reassured the mom that she could trust you to be sensitive to her daughter\u2019s needs rather than worrying she needed to protect her daughter from you.\n\nETA for the downvote brigade:  This is coming from my perspective as someone who has spent countless hours doing pro bono advocacy work for people will disabilities.  I never make assumptions about my clients\u2019 abilities without getting to know them first, because without understanding who they are as individuals, I cannot advocate for them properly.  That is exactly what I\u2019m saying OP should have done here, gotten to know this girl and understand who she is before charging in as a self-proclaimed hero who might have actually made the situation worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sure, given time, there would've been countless ways to combat the situation in a more suitable fashion.  \nI really hope I didn't exacerbate anything for her daughter.  \n\n\nHowever, please don't look past how she spoke to everyone there.  \nShe was bullying the very people there trying to fight bullying culture by \"poo-poo'ing\" all there ideas.  \nI was sticking up for myself and them too.  \n\n\nHindsight is 20/20 and all that and I like to think this experience helped me become a more understanding and caring, compassionate person, thank you for helping me realize I did what most would consider to be the right thing.", "NTA. A lot of people's first bullies are their own parents. \n\nI wonder if there's anything her daughter CAN do or is she just infantalizing her because she's kept her daughter from growing past a certain age? Does the mom see her daughter as someone that can potentially do more as she matures into an adult or is she stuck in the infant years where her daughter can't do anything for herself and the mom thinks that's how she'll stay forever?\n\nBeing told all the things you can't do by the one person you trust the most in the world is kind of ableist, no? Don't you think focusing on the thing's she isn't able to do is not as important as speaking upon the things her daughters CAN do?\n\nBecause it just seems like she wants to shut down a conversation about solutions rather than work with others who have been bullied to find an option that works for her daughter as well as everyone in attendance. \n\nIndependence looks different on every disability. But not being able to take because your caretaker won't let you doesn't tell me she's looking out for her daughters well being.  \n\nLet her speak, even if it isn't perfect. Nobody expects perfection from communication, anyway.", "NTA. I am impressed with how well you phrased that.

There\u2019s ways you go around to help people with these kind of needs and this is not it. You meant well but you went about it the wrong way.", "NTA. You told the real bully to stop bullying, I mean, that's what your group is about..", "Are you high? OP literally tried to get to know her.
