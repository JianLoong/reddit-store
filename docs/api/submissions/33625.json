I \"sort of\" adopted my niece when she was 9. I say \"sort of\" because I didn't legally adopt her but she has been living with us because her parents are neglectful and were very willing to \"get rid of her\".\n\nThe problem started about a year ago. I don't know what happened but suddenly that sweet caring little girl was gone and instead she became really angry and rude. She constantly fights with my daughter and makes her cry.\n\nYesterday my daughter accidently broke my niece's phone. My niece was very angry because my daughter isn't allowed to touch her phone. She demanded we buy another phone for her which is not possible at the time because of financial reasons. She then demanded we sell my daughter's Ipad(which we recently bought as a christmas gift) and buy a phone for her and when we refused she grabbed the gift that had the Ipad in it(she knew which one it was, she helped me wrap the gifts) and broke it on purpose. My daughter was crying so hard when she found out what the gift was\n\nAfter she did this I was so angry that I told her she will be spending this christmas with her parents because we don't want her here. She yelled at us and called us assholes and said she knew we are \"just like her parents\"\n\nNow I feel awful because I feel like I might have overreacted", "created_utc": 1703347759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18p8uqe/aita_for_forcing_my_niece_to_spend_this_christmas/", "score": 1111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You would rather give a gift to your child who not only took something that she was not supposed to, but broke it.\n\nThe appropriate, parental, thing to do was to sell the iPad and fix the phone.  Your daughter deserved punishment.  Instead, you showed your \"true colors\" to your niece and added on to her trauma and feelings of never belonging.\n\nHave you even tried to get this poor child therapy to deal with all of the abandonment she has experienced.  You have now seriously compounded that.  \n\nDo you have ANY true remorse?", "YTA - First of all, it wasn\u2019t \u201caccidental\u201d. Your daughter deliberately broke a rule and destroyed someone else\u2019s property and you are brushing it off. The ease of which you skim over this fact hints that this is an ongoing issue. She\u2019s seven, not a toddler, she is fully capable of understanding consequences of her actions. You, as a parent, should have found a way to replace said item and punished your child. If that meant selling or returning the iPad, then so be it, that\u2019s the consequence of destroying someone else\u2019s property you aren\u2019t allowed to touch. If she had done this to any other teenager you can bet this post would be different. If your child broke another kid\u2019s phone at a park and their parents flipped out and demanded you pay to replace it, if you refused you\u2019d be hit with a cop call and small claims court.\n\nSecondly, you ARE just like niece\u2019s parents. She\u2019s suddenly angry and hostile? Connect her with a therapist instead of shouldering all the blame on a neglected teenager going through puberty with parents that don\u2019t love her. Most school\u2019s have free resources just for this. She makes your daughter cry and gets into fights with her all the time? Those fights would probably be a hell of a lot less if your kid was actually punished instead of enabled when she got into teenager\u2019s belongings and broke, damaged, or took things. She snaps and lashes out when a very expensive item is destroyed and you full stop refuse to do anything about it? Welp, she\u2019s not my kid. Let\u2019s dump her back at the place she\u2019s not wanted since she\u2019s not wanted here either and TELL THAT TO HER FACE. \n\nThird, your daughter is your favorite. There\u2019s no sugar coating that. There\u2019s no, well my niece is as good as mine inflections in your post. Don\u2019t expect good behavior when you take a traumatized child into your home when you have a golden child already. Kids aren\u2019t idiots, and now this teenager is looking at how she SHOULD be treated every day and finding her own situation\u2026lacking. \n\nSo yeah, YTA.", "YTA. My guy, that 15 yr old girl knows her parents don't want her. You need to stop and think about what that would mean and feel like. You're seriously wondering why she's angry and rude and argumentative? You don't have the emotional maturity to empathise with her. But you expect her to be able to process being abandoned alone.\n\n\nSort yourself out.", "INFO: How many other items of your niece\u2019s has your daughter broken, stolen, or used without permission?", "Your daughter destroyed her phone and your refusing responsibility for your daughter's destructiveness. \n\nYou owe your niece a new phone, your kid can't be going around breaking other people's stuff and you shrug it off and that's it.\n\nYou're treating her like a second class citizen, I really don't care she acted out after being treated like that. She could use some therapy either way she's been through a lot.YTA", "Why when your daughter broke something was it \"oh well\" but when your niece broke something she gets kicked out? \n\nLike I get your niece is older and this was intentional damage but I can see why she was frustrated. Her belonging was damaged and you just dismissed it.", "Simple rule: Your kid breaks it, you pay it.", "It seems to me the problem was when your daughter broke the phone she was not suppose to touch. Then you compounded the problem by not treating your daughter's actions as you should have.  You absolutely should have come up with a way to replace that phone and your daughter should have faced consequences. \n\nBut you excused your angel's \"mistake\" and told your niece tough shit when it came to her phone.\n\nBut she has inexplicably morphed into an angry girl, you say? Let's see. Outright rejection by her parents (a primal fear fyi) and then relegated to just take whatever shit your beloved, faultless child throws her way. Yeah, no, what could she be so miserable about??\n\nIn case you haven't picked up on it yet, yes, I'd say YTA. Stunning you actually thought you'd get some support for your side of the story. Reveals so much of what life must be like for your poor niece.", "YTA. \n\nI'm guessing your niece's behavior change is mainly in direct relation to probably a lot more instances of the preference you show to your own daughter over her. \nIf you are unable to treat both children equally with love and the consequences of bad behavior, you should have never taken her in. Same advice I would give a step-parent or foster parent.\nYes, she is older, and intentional destruction of property is worse than accidental, but I'm guessing you let your daughter get away with overstepping your niece's boundaries a lot and her escalating behavior is a direct result of that. Teenagers are full of new hormones, and their behaviors are unstable because their brain is still learning impulse control along with adjusting to this influx of hormones. You treating her like a burden isn't helping.\nI have no doubt your differing behavior towards her and your daughter have only added to her deep trauma of unworthiness and abandonment.", "YTA. You have a child (and yes, a teenager is a child) in your care who is already unwanted by her parents. She shouldn\u2019t have broken the iPad, but that is not an excuse to use her issues (already knowing her parents don\u2019t want her) as a way to punish her. \n\nYou ABSOLUTELY overreacted. You do not threaten to send a neglected child away when you get upset. \n\nYou need to apologize, get your niece therapy, and make sure you never pull something like this again.", "YTA. So much TA. Do you have any clue to the amount of damage you have inflicted on that poor child with your outburst? You didn't just overreact, you piled more trauma onto an already traumatized child. \n\nThere is currently a friend of my son's living in our house. He's been here for 2 months. I picked him up off the side of the road, carrying everything he owned in two backpacks and a garbage bag. His aunt had/has legal custody of him because his parents were drug addicts and the state had stepped in. Aunt threw him out, told him she didn't want him any longer. That poor boy sobbed for days. How no one wanted him, how sorry he was, how he just wanted someone who loved him. That's how you made your niece feel.", "YTA and worse than her parents. Because while they were neglectful, they at least sent her to someone willing to have her. You on the other hand sent a child back to neglectful parents.", "Wth did your daughter do with the phone that it broke? Also, she\u2019s 7 not 2, that\u2019s old enough to understand she\u2019s not allowed to touch something. \n\nAnd yes, YTA. What a horrible thing to say to your niece.", "How dare you admit you took your niece away from a horrible neglectful situation and then use it as punishment. That\u2019s actually terrible. The rest of it is whatever to me - what it boils down to is you\u2019re using an abusive situation as punishment which makes you a huge a-hole. YTA", "YTA. You showed your niece you ARE like her parents, bc your terms of care and support for her are conditional. Not saying breaking things are acceptable but she needs help, not to be sent to her parents who ACTIVELY neglect her.", "So...your niece has gotten angry and fights with your daughter.  Your daughter who destroyed her phone?  Hmmm...wow....if only there's an epiphany in there.  If you only look at it for awhile, I think you'll be able to figure out the correlation there...", "So, you have a niece acting out due to abandonment issues and your first thought to punish her is to THREATEN TO ABANDON HER. \n\nWow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "Okay but why did Ur daughter touch her phone when she is not allowed to", "YTA. You\u2019re raising your daughter into being the brat you try to make your niece out to be.", "I agree with most everyone else. YTA. Curious what you had bought your niece for Christmas? You were giving your daughter an iPad (which you can probably return). I have a feeling your niece was also probably depressed about Christmas, especially if she watches your daughter get cool gifts every year while she doesn\u2019t. I hope I am wrong.", "YTA\n\n>She demanded we buy another phone for her which is not possible at the time because of financial reasons. She then demanded we sell my daughter's Ipad (which we recently bought as a christmas gift) and buy a phone for her.\n\nYou wrote this and didn't see anything wrong? \n\nThe fact that she's your niece is not important. If it was someone else's phone that your daughter broke, you still should give that person money for a new phone. You clearly had the finances. And teach your daughter some respect to both the rules given to her and to material things themselves.", "YTA for threatening to send a child who is clearly dealing with emotional trauma back to the place from which the trauma comes because she acted out after someone broke something important of hers and was told to suck it up because it would not be replaced. You're also the A-hole for claiming to take in your niece but then threatening to throw her out when things get hard and for not punishing your daughter for breaking something that wasn't hers and for not finding a way to replace the broken item or at least reassuring your niece of how it will be fixed.", "Yta, first abandoned by her parents. Then abandoned by her only person who took a parental role. Emotional neglect, emotional abuse (by telling her she is not wanted). You and her parents are horrible.", "YTA. Omg! The iPad should have been returned. Your 7 yr old is old enough to know better. No wonder your niece has been so angry I\u2019m sure she\u2019s shown very explicitly where she lies in your family dynamic. Not wanted by her parents or her aunt. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Holy cow. Your DD broke the phone on purpose. Your niece is going through huge teenage hormonal changes coupled with abandonment issues. Her parents neglected her and you haven\u2019t officially adopted her. She\u2019s in flux and belongs nowhere. This poor baby must live in flight or fight 24/7. \n\nPlease either assure her you\u2019re her home no matter what or let her go. If you\u2019re her home, show her. Stand by her, get her therapy, and don\u2019t play favorites. My heart breaks for this poor girl.

Your daughter should have consequences for breaking a phone she was not allowed to touch in the first place, and that falls 100% on you.", "It\u2019s irrelevant that she\u2019s your niece or that you are raising her imo. If your child touches something that they know they are not supposed to touch and breaks it and it belongs to someone else as a parent you replace it. How you do so is your problem, if you have to take a loan or return a Xmas gift or whatever you do it. And your youngest deserves a consequence for her behavior also.", "YTA.", "YTA\u2026You\u2019re either her parents or you\u2019re not.

She's in a pivotal time in her development and yes even when she pushes back she still needs your guidance. She's testing her boundaries with you and you showed her that she's not worth the fight which is what she's already feeling from her bio parents.", "I call bullshit on you not knowing what happened. It\u2019s called being a teenager with a family who don\u2019t care and/or love her.  She\u2019s at the age where she is starting to understand her crappy family dynmaics and guess what Sherlock she\u2019s acting out because of it.  Seriously are you that clueless? \n\nYour daughter knowingly took her phone and broke it.  Why did your daughter take the phone?  Was your daughter punished at all? \n\nYTA and you know it but you thought somehow Reddit was going to absolve you.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, your daughter broke your nieces phone, and you shrugged it off. With no assurance that it would be fixed or somehow replaced, I can understand your nieces frustration. There was no accountability regarding your daughter, breaking the phone.\n\nI do agree that she should not have intentionally broken the iPad. But I think you definitely overreacted by threatening to kick her out. Sending her back to the original place of her trauma.\n\nYou know that she comes from this traumatic background, and threatening to kick her out and abandon her a second time is only going to make that trauma worse. Your actions have now solidified in her mind that she is a second-class citizen, and she\u2019s not worthy of being anywhere.\n\nYou need now to help her get therapy because otherwise, this is going to last her lifetime. I know this because I was brought up in an environment where my mother used to tell me that she hated me and wished I was never born, and then, when she got pissed off or wanted to punish me, she would threaten to send me away. Of course I believed that because she told me she hated me and wished I was never born. It affects me to this day.  **Please don\u2019t do this to your niece.**", "YTA. Your daughter broke her phone. She is SEVEN not a toddler. She knew damn well she wasn\u2019t allowed to touch her cousin\u2019s phone and therefore this wasn\u2019t an accident, it was the result of her willfully doing something she had no business doing. You were and are in fact responsible for replacing it by any means necessary. \n\nShould your niece have intentionally broken the iPad in retaliation? Of course not. But teenagers have poor emotional regulation and impulse control. \n\nForcing her to spend the holiday with her abusive parents is a complete low-blow and you are in fact no better than her shitty parents if this your idea of appropriate discipline.\n\nETA: also, what happened last year was that she turned 14 and is dealing with the fallout of emotional trauma. wtf did you expect, sunshine and roses 24/7? It\u2019s your job to teach her how to handle her emotions and model emotional regulation and get her professional help if necessary. You failed.", "You *might* have overreacted???????? \n\nYTA holy fuck", "YTA. That poor child.", "YTA and everything she said was correct. You let your kid off the hook and even rewarded her for her behavior and told your niece she is not important to you.\n\nYou\u2019ve permanently and irreparably destroyed your relationship with your niece. Congratulations.", "YTA\n\nWith what has happened, it understable that you were angry. She has to understand that \nwhat she has done is not ok. However, saying \nto her that she is going back to her bio parents is hurtful. She knew since she was a child that she was unwanted. And with what you have said, she thinks that she is also a burden in your house.\n\nThis sudden change is happening for something. You have to talk to her, know her feelings, if something has happened to her, that she is still loved (now and forever) and she can rely on you.\n\nWhy is she saying \"I knew you were like them\"? Did her bio parents reached to her and said anything to her? Or maybe someone else?\n\nAnd, Can you repair her phone? Like, replace her screen?

This is the kind of thing that you only begin to process at that age and this newfound emotional turmoil could certainly be a (justified) trigger for some of her anger. \n\nYou should invest in a therapist for her, replace her phone and if you send her back to people who clearly do not care for her simply because she isn\u2019t conveniently \u201csweet\u201d for you anymore, YTA 100%.", "Of course, she\u2019s angry.

However, if she's going to be intentionally destroying property in your house, you have zero obligation to keep housing her, and after replacing the phone, you would not be an AH to not continue to provide for a child that isn't your responsibility and is treating you and your home with tremendous disrespect, showing no gratitude for the absolutely astounding amount you have done for her by taking her in for years.  \n\nYeah, she was abandoned by her parents, and that sucks.  But that doesn't make you an AH for not accepting her mistreating you and your daughter in your own home.  The thing you did wrong here was not replacing the phone - but her reaction was wildly, wildly out of hand, and if she has become too difficult to handle, you are not obligated to have your own life become hellish trying to ease hers while she abuses you.", "Esh.

It\u2019s your primary job to raise and protect your own child. \n\nI work with kids and have seen dozens of phones accidentally broken by elementary aged kids.

The counseling is for YOU. You need to learn some life skills before you can be modeling for her.", "ESH. Have you placed her in therapy to deal with her feelings? You should have gotten her another phone. You could have added it to your phone plan. Your daughter knew she wasn\u2019t allowed to touch the phone, and she did it anyway.

I \"sort of\" adopted my niece when she was 9. I say \"sort of\" because I didn't legally adopt her but she has been living with us because her parents are neglectful and were very willing to \"get rid of her\".\n\nThe problem started about a year ago. I don't know what happened but suddenly that sweet caring little girl was gone and instead she became really angry and rude. She constantly fights with my daughter and makes her cry.\n\nYesterday my daughter accidently broke my niece's phone. My niece was very angry because my daughter isn't allowed to touch her phone. She demanded we buy another phone for her which is not possible at the time because of financial reasons. She then demanded we sell my daughter's Ipad(which we recently bought as a christmas gift) and buy a phone for her and when we refused she grabbed the gift that had the Ipad in it(she knew which one it was, she helped me wrap the gifts) and broke it on purpose. My daughter was crying so hard when she found out what the gift was\n\nAfter she did this I was so angry that I told her she will be spending this christmas with her parents because we don't want her here. She yelled at us and called us assholes and said she knew we are \"just like her parents\"\n\nNow I feel awful because I feel like I might have overreacted\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter broke her phone, your niece didn't do anything wrong. She's a teenager that now doesn't have a phone because of a 7 year old. Weather it was accidental or not. You need to tell your daughter why what she did is wrong and to apologise.  You need to give your niece a hug.", "YTA!", "I think you already know the answer - but as for the broken iPad, if you party a credit card you might have coverage for breakage.\nGet a refund, replace your niece\u2019s broken phone (but ground her like she deserves), buy a cheaper tablet for your daughter (but ground her like she also deserves) and do better.", "YTA. First off take some responsibility for the fact that your child broke someone else's property. Because you are her parent is your responsibility to replace the phone. In fact you should have taken the damn iPad and returned it and used that money to repair or replace the phone. You're going to sit there and tell your niece that you can't replace the phone after she saw that you can afford an iPad? So what is your child learning from this? That she can break things with impunity? Sure, that'll work out well in the real world.\n\nSecondly, and even more importantly you turned out a kid at Christmas, back to parents who don't even want her. She already felt unwanted by her parents and now she's unwanted by you. I don't agree with her breaking the iPad but you went too far. She reacted to a situation caused by you and your kid. And you went nuclear in return. She's probably better off without you or her parents in her life. I really feel bad for her.", "YTA. If you\u2019ve taken her in, it is very much your responsibility to replace her phone, 1000000x more so since your kid broke it. I find it hard to believe your financial situation is that precarious if you bought your daughter an iPad for Christmas. You owe your niece a huge apology, ongoing therapy, an invitation to come back for Christmas, and a replacement phone.", "YTA\n\nThe iPad should have been returned to replace the phone your kid broke. Everything else is irrelevant to the story and serves to simply attempt to sway the reader into judging you more favorably. \n\nReddit usually disappoints me. I can\u2019t wait to see if they surprise me by perusing the comments.", "Absolutely YTA. Your niece is going through puberty, which is awful enough. Adding in the past trauma and abandonment, and you can absolutely expect some behavior issues. You will compound these issues by abandoning her back into the situation that has caused so much of her trauma. \n\nFor the issue mentioned, your kid broke her property. It should be your responsibility to replace broken property, especially when there was a clear disregard for the rules. From a psychological standpoint, that phone is probably the one piece of property that she may consider truly hers and allowing your child to escape without consequence is going to further validate your niece\u2019s feeling that she doesn\u2019t matter to anyone. She doesn\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d to anyone and can easily be cast out. \n\nShe needs counseling and you all would probably benefit from some family counseling to explore your situation together.", "You are just like her parents.

They suck and make you question ever having kids, but you can't let them know that - they are fragile and trying to learn how to be a person.  I don't know the answer to the phone/iPad issue, but you need to apologize and tell her that you love her and want her there.", "Yta.. not that your niece gets an excuse for her mean behavior but you said she turned from a sweet girl to what she is now and she is 14. Welcome to the teen years. I am going through this too with my daughter. Sounds like  behavior was bad all around, broken phone, broken iPad, crying , feelings hurt. I don\u2019t think the solution was to tell her you didn\u2019t want her around for Christmas. Chances are your own  daughter will become the same unpleasant moody rude teenager at some point also. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t tell her that??", "YTA,\n\nYour daughter broke her phone.  You don't know if it was intentional or not, just that she claims it was accidental.  And she wasn't supposed to use/touch the phone.\n\nYour response was in the order of \"sucks to be you\" and daughter is still getting a new ipad.\n\nDon't do it half assed.  If you are stepping up to parent your niece then do it.  If not, then send her back to parents or to CPS.", "YTA.", "YTA. So much. You have shown her you are really like her parents, willing to get rid of her in the minute things get difficult, as well as the fact you don't really treat her like your daughter and heavily favour your own child. Of course she is angry and resentful! She is a teenager abandoned by her parents and seems like the people who take care of her (because I am sure she is very aware that you haven't legally adopted her, or take custody of her, so she can be out of your house at any given moment) not only favour the other child in the house, but that threaten her to force her to be with her abusers (because neglect is also abuse) as soon as things get difficult. The fact that is the first thing that came out of your mouth after justifying your daughter's behaviour speak volumes and heavily implies that this is not the first time you threaten her to go back to her neglectful parents when things go wrong. So congratulations for adding to a teenagers trauma and hurting a kid that have already been dealt with difficult cards in life. If you have a little conscience left, you at least won't force her to go back to her parents for Christmas. \n\nAnd you should punish your daughter and you should not buy an ipad for a 7 years old kid, especially if \"money is tight\" (I assume it is not tight for the daughter, only when it concerns the niece).", "YTA- time to take stock and think about your family and what you want in the future. I suggest finding a trusted advisor and counselor to sort this through. Let us start with there is one adult in the house, and this adult needs to step up today.", "YTA. It may not be legal but you have two children. You should never have taken in your niece if you were going to treat her like a second- class citizen in the home. \n\nYour niece was justifiably upset when your younger daughter broke her phone after breaking the no touching rule. A phone to a teenager is not only expensive but essential for her social life. Your niece was right that your daughter should be punished. She\u2019s old enough to face consequences for breaking a rule with respect to someone else\u2019s important and expensive belongings. You are also teaching your younger daughter that she can act with impunity towards someone in the home who is considered less important. The fact that you told your niece you couldn\u2019t replace the phone but still planned to give a really expensive present to your daughter speaks volumes.\n\nYour niece was out of line taking matters into her own hands by breaking the iPad. The anger underlying the act was understandable, but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. She\u2019s going to be in trouble if she starts being destructive when she\u2019s angry, even when the feeling is justified. \n\nBut. She is acting like a teenager and reached a breaking point when you treated your two kids incredibly unfairly. Then you threw her, your de facto kid, out of the home like garbage. Would you have done this if your younger child had done one thing equally serious? I doubt it.\n\nYour niece will never forget this and probably will have real trust issues in the future. Teenagers act like jerks. It is part of growing up. They test boundaries and depend on the stability of the home to work through it. You signed up for this phase of life when you took her in. But now you\u2019ve made clear she has to be better than a normal kid if she is going to get your love and care.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you can fix this.

I know people like to complain about teenagers and phones, but when you think about it this is what she would be using to keep in touch with friends, to share memories or to communicate with you, her caregivers, if she is doing things like after school clubs. You could explain like \"OK, we can't afford a new phone but we can afford a second hand one for now.\" That way you would be doing something rather than nothing at all.\n\nAlso, I am not exactly clear on what/any consequences you have given daughter, or any conversations you have had with her about why we respect other people and their belongings and don't take things without permission.

It sort of sounds like you take the second option a lot of the time. 15 is a tough age, but very few kids \"suddenly become angry and rude\" out of absolutely nowhere, and I am guessing from your post that niece is sort of used to taking the back seat to your daughter which probably makes her feel unwanted or unlovable. Add on tot his whatever trauma she has from her parents. Behaviour is communication, and your niece has been communicating that she doesn't feel safe or respected or loved for a while now, would be my guess anyway.\n\nYou've got a choice here, either step up fully to take care of your niece or find someone else who will. Kids aren't stupid, and they can work out when someone sees them as an obligation or a chore versus when someone loves and cares for them, and feeling like you are an unwanted obligation will mess with anyone's head. You're not doing a favour for your niece, and you're setting your daughter up to be a bit of a brat in the future if you continue to give her a pass. You've let the situation escalate when you could have dealt with it, by taking the easy option of just expecting the older kid to deal. \n\nAlso, by saying you will send your niece back to her neglectful parents you've basically proven that you're not a safe adult in her life. You've probably done a whole world of damage just by doing that. It's not OK that niece broke something, but it sounds like by failing to deal with these issues you've allowed them to explode and ultimately both kids have been harmed here.", "YTA, kids can\u2019t be returned to sender when they don\u2019t act the way you want them to.

It's the right thing to do.", "YTA. BUT! I do believe you both aren\u2019t emotionally equipped to deal with this situation. Your niece has been abandoned and neglected by her birth parents. Yes your niece may have started off fine but over time she most likely has become more aware of what\u2019s going on and probably has some resentment/trauma with her parents. Not having your real parents there or knowing they don\u2019t want you takes such an emotional toll on the person. So please think about your niece and what kinds of emotions she\u2019s having. I personally think therapy would be a great start for her and even you! Start the journey on healing these wounds. Even though your nieces behavior was not okay there is totally a reason behind it. Get to the root of the emotions. She must be so sad and have confusing feelings about her parents. Empathy and compassion go a long way, especially dealing with her lashing out due to emotional, physical, and mental neglect from her parents. Just know this situation can improve without you threatening to send her somewhere where she is already unwanted. So yeah..YTA but I know you can reach deep down and be the support and love she needs right now.", "Geez. You don\u2019t think that maybe she understands no one wants her? And how awful that is for any kid? Then you told her she has to go to her neglectful parents because \u201cwe don\u2019t want her here\u201d. No wonder she acts like she does.

I\u2019ve worked as a teacher and I\u2019ve specifically worked with children with special needs, including emotional and behavioral problems.\n\nI\u2019m going to put aside the cell phone issue, for now. I\u2019m also giving as much benefit of the doubt as I can. You\u2019re human, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed and angry, especially when it comes to financial stresses around the holidays.\n\nTeenagers lash out, that\u2019s what they do. So your niece lashing out is perfectly normal teenage behavior.\n\nBut the reason it feels like she\u2019s lashing out at you is because she is **trying to push you away** because she wants to see how you\u2019ll react. Will you do what her parents did and send her packing? Or will you show her unconditional love?\n\nUnfortunately, you just showed her that she doesn\u2019t have your unconditional love, and you will send her packing when she steps out of line. She\u2019s already been shown by her parents that they don\u2019t love her. Now, you\u2019ve gone solidified every fear she has that you never actually wanted her around, and she\u2019s just a massive inconvenience to you, rather than a child you love. Right now, that girl is sitting there thinking \u201cno one actually loves me or wants me around,\u201d and she *desperately needs help.*\n\nYou\u2019re in a rough spot now, and she is in an even more fragile state of mind than she\u2019s ever been. The true way back is to apologize for threatening to send her away, and explain that you won\u2019t ever send her away, but also explain that she can\u2019t just get away with treating you poorly, either. You need to show her she is safe and loved, and I suspect that once she feels safe and loved her behavior will begin to correct itself slightly.\n\nI mean, she will still be a teenager.\n\nIt\u2019s cliche to say \u201ctherapy,\u201d but you and her need therapy to work through what is happening here.

This will be a lasting memory for her that will mess her up for a long time. It\u2019s just an iPhone and iPad (material possessions), punish her appropriately and move on.

They will take out their frustrations on their younger siblings. It is frustrating and hard to deal with, but it is normal.

You are her parent. You need to see her as equal to your own daughter when it comes to understanding their disagreements.

I can\u2019t imagine thinking I wasn\u2019t in the wrong here.", "This is the only answer.\n\n\n\nSeriously, this post gave me flashbacks to my messy youth.\n\n\n\nMy parents dumped me on my aunt and uncle who have a son the same age as me.\n\n\n\nMy aunt never hesitated to remind me that my parents didn't want me, I was unwanted all the way through, it was her house or foster care and she took me in out of the goodness of her heart...\n\n\n\nAnything my cousin did was good and correct. Anything I did was bad and wrong. \nShe literally labeled the kids stuff like our lawn chairs as #1 and #2. I was #2. But if my cousin wanted my chair he could have it, if I accidentally sat in #1 I was in trouble. \n\n\n\nThis led to my cousin exploiting this biased system to no end just to get me in trouble. \n\n\n\nI was kicked out at 17 as soon as I graduated high school. \nI spent years people pleasing and feeling worthless.\n\n\n\nAs adults now my cousin is such a weird human. He lacks empathy, has seriously bigoted views, a very small world, no relationships. \n\n\n\nIt took me a very long time to understand that their behaviour toward me is not a reflection of me. It's a reflection of them. The way they treated a child was wrong and it not only damaged me, it damaged their son who they actively favoured in such a way that he feels incredibly and irrevocably entitled and superior. \n\n\n\nSo, OP, YTA. 100%.\nIf you take in a relative and give them a home you need to be all the way in on raising that child. If you feel that you can't raise them in a fair and reasonable way you're doing everyone a disservice. You're not protecting your biological child, you're showing your daughter that her own cousin is less of a person than she is because she can go through life with impunity, you'll protect her. Being a good parent is developing a good character in a fresh human being and understanding consequences, understanding fairness and justice, understanding treating others with respect and dignity, that's all huge. \nYou showed both children that you're incapable of even treating a child with dignity. \n\n\n\nIn no world is it okay to make a human being, let alone a traumatised teen, feel that they are unwanted or unloved. \n\n\n\nSurely you are not so distant from the early years of your life that you don't recall how desperate things feel when you're a teen. Emotional regulation is something you learn and in early development when the brain is traumatised that gets harder. Being regularly shown that she's got no security in her life, that she's unwanted, no, YTA for reaffirming that in a myriad of little ways that will have a lasting impact on the person you're influencing. \n\n\n\nYou've done both children a disservice. \nHopefully your niece will learn to forgive you.\n\n\n\nI never did. I haven't spoken to my aunt in years. My uncle usually tries to call and check in once a year or so, but I just grey rock these people.\n\n\n\nI live an incredible and full life now. I have an amazing husband, I was able to follow my dreams, I own a home, I have wonderful friends. My life is full of love and support. They don't get to be a part of that because when I stood up for myself saying that I deserve to be more than a last minute consideration, they treated me like I was being very silly indeed. \n\n\n\nYour niece will hopefully build her own family, but I hope like hell for her that she's able to get better and faster support for herself than I did. I wasted too many years being angry about years 1-17 and beyond where I had no security or support from my family. It wasn't until leaving an abusive relationship at 30 that I really started to turn my life around. And some kids like us never turn things around and they go through life depressed and angry, they develop addiction, they lead short and desolate lives because the kind of shame that comes from being a throw away human being, something you've actively reinforced, is life shaking in a way I hope you never experience. No one, ever, deserves to feel disposable for any reason at any time. That child has value and she's in pain.\n\n\n\n\nSo, OP, I really hope you read this and you learn something from my story and stop treating a human being like a burden or get her the support she needs so you can be more hands off. Frankly, I worry about any child in your hands.", "I\u2019m also just so freaking horrified at the idea of putting a child in an abusive situation (because child neglect is abuse) as punishment.
