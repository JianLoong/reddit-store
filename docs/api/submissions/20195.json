But, I will say there are a lot of unknown variables. If the \"friends\" in this scenario were all drinking as heavily as OP, then who's to say whether they were coherent enough to encourage/discourage you going home with this guy. It's never wise to drink a lot, but we're not wise when we're young and heartbroken. The real question is how much did this guy drink? IMO, if he was not as far gone, he took advantage. The friends should not have been so pushy, but it probably wasn't malicious on their part, especially if they were already a few drinks in. From reading the comments, I'd say I'm in the minority here, but my verdict would be \"everyone sucks\".  He sucks for taking advantage (of your emotions at the least, or worse if he were not drinking as much). Friends suck for being pushy and not checking in. OP only might suck a little for not cutting down on the drinking. (Again, only might.) Bottom line: we all make stupid mistakes. I'm sorry you were in this situation at all, and it sucks.
