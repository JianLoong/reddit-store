If they were both blacked out, could he get her to his home?? The logical leaps you make to protect this guy are astonishing.", "Hell yeah. No double standards here. \n\nI have personally been in this position in my early 20s. I got drunk at a house party, could barely talk, layed down in my very new girlfriends bed (who I hadn\u2019t yet slept with) and she assumed I wanted to have sex because I am a man (I guess?). \n\nShe took of my pants and even though I couldn\u2019t get it up, got on top of me and did her thing. I did not consent. It was rape (be definition).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t affect me in anyway at all emotionally etc. it\u2019s something that happened, I didn\u2019t like it, I moved on. \n\nMy above point also alludes to men (and women) protecting themselves. Consent is there for BOTH parties.\n\nEdit: Let\u2019s be real. The news paints women who take advantage of men with entirely different language. Women teachers have oral sex with students, male teachers \u201crape students.\u201d Millions of examples. I don\u2019t want to dive into it but society for some reasons expects more responsibility from men in those situations.\n\nI\u2019m okay with that. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to be a 100% above reproach?", "Yep ok, for real it's not worth defending the friends, cause their actions aren't worth defending.", "How is \"sober enough to get home\" at all proof of how drunk you are? I grew up with an alcoholic. There were times he was so drunk he would fall multiple times just getting from the door to his bedroom and couldn't say a single coherent word. He could still make his way home", "Can't believe I need to explain this to you. \n\nThere are things beyond our control that we cannot be held responsible for (such as other peoples behavior), it is not her fault that she was raped.\n\nThankfully there are things in our life that we can control. This is important as there are bad people in the world that will take advantage of us if given the opportunity. \n\nIt is our own personal responsibility to do what we can to mitigate risk, it is absolutely her fault for getting black out drunk (correct me if I am wrong but you seem to think it isn't?).\n\nOnce she got black out drunk, her \"friends\" failed to protect her, that's on them, not her fault what happened from that point onward.\n\nObviously the guy she went home with is 100% responsible for his actions.\n\nAll parties involved in this situation, OP, her friends and the guy have a level of personal responsibility in this shit show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOp has already posted in this thread that she won't get black out drunk again, so even she realizes the level of personal responsibility she has in this mess, so the real question is why can't you?", "I do too because I felt safe without having to be in a big group of people. I'm not much of a drinker and especially not after the incident described above, but on the off chance I do go out I'd prefer going somewhere that cares about my well-being.", "I'm sorry too. That's so awful. \n\nAnd you're absolutely right. Friends like that are definitely no friends at all. People suck.\n\nI barely drink anymore and I have two daughters and will absolutely be sharing my experience with them when they're at drinking age/telling me to call them literally any time. It's a scary world.", "Wow, sounds like rape to me. Your \"friends\" are no friends. They made a joke out of it if you ask me. Don't be with friends like that. Friends take care of each other when drunk, not let them be raped by the next guy.\n\nNTA.", "Bad bot. Stolen comment.", "[deleted]", "So the man who she had sex with raped her? We don\u2019t what she said to him. She said that to her friends and doesn\u2019t remember. I have woken up from a heavy night of drinking and barely remembering the previous night but if I hooked up with another drunk guy and I had sex I wouldn\u2019t sober up and say I was raped. Unless I was trying to stop HIM and telling HIM no- but she didn\u2019t say any of that in her post. And given all the other details she included I think it\u2019s safe to assume that had she felt raped she\u2019d say that. What she IS saying is she told her friends she wasn\u2019t trying to hookup, got mad AT them when they wouldn\u2019t stop encouraging a hookup and then they stopped. She has shit friends and we can\u2019t assume rape based on the information provided.", "She said no TO HER FRIENDS!!! Not the dude. And when she told them to quit pushing them together, they stopped!", "Fair. ig my perspective is that even if it wasn't the most moral situation, the man in the original post didn't rape her. He was just stupid, probably drunk, and probably not the most moral person in the world.", "Exactly. They have nothing to defend. They were so fucking wrong and selfish. Truly disgusting human being. Really thankful I have true genuine people around me who want to keep me safe. Really sad to hear a story like this. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to care about someone either.", "He likely didn\u2019t make it home by the skin of his teeth if he was able to account for a blacked out person and got her there as well. You are projecting.", "You explained your point well. OP is at fault because she got blackout drunk, as if being blackout drunk automatically means you\u2019re going to get raped therefore it\u2019s your fault if you get blackout drunk.\n\nYou know millions of people get black out drunk and don\u2019t get raped right?", "Yeah I almost never drink anymore. And I'm really careful who I drink around, even if it's just a little bit.", "She says he was interested from early on and she said no and was upset at people trying to push it in the OP I believe.", "She said no to HER FRIENDS! Please show me where she wrote that she told the guy No\u2026..", "Yeah, I agree in practice. But society doesn\u2019t play by fair rules. It only takes one dude being a drunk short-sighted idiot to ruin the rest of his life for some sex. If the roles are reversed it somehow doesn\u2019t matter as much. I can\u2019t change that.\n\nLegally - they raped each other lol. They both couldn\u2019t consent by the definition of the law.", "You wanna stick to one subject?", "Yeah it's definitely not her fault she got raped.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes but it's just frustrating to see the same mistakes being made over and over, its as if society doesnt learn.\n\nGetting black out drunk is never worth it, I wish that was a message people were handed every time they went to a bar/club\n\nMaybe I'm just getting old and pessimistic :)", "Can anyone copy paste where she said no to the guy? She told her friends to stop pushing them together and they stopped. I'm not saying it's her fault. I'm saying that we can't automatically put fault on a guy just because he's a guy.", "To the subject of the sub, yes.", "So after she got drunk her taste changed?? Or she has to explicitly say no while blacked out in order not to get rsped?? Have you heard of enthusiastic consent? Look it up.", "She says she got after her friends for pushing them together. She does not say that the guy had any idea that she was not interested. Maybe they were acting like immature idtiots (like many drunk people act), and she said \" oh come on guys behave\". She doesn't say that she ever told the guy no. I have been in this situation so may times because I'm shy in front of people I don't know. I would privately tell my friends to leave me alone. I would not say something in front of the guy. I'm not saying 100% it wasn't rape, but there is not enough info here to have so many people say that this is 100% rape.\n\nEdit: if you're going to down vote me, at least have the decency to answer my question: where does it say that she let THE GUY know that she wasn't interested?\n\nHer friends suck, that's not the question. They knew she wasn't interested."]}
