I didn't asked much about their fight tbh, it's their own thing to deal with. Then the break got effective and since he didn't had any place to live and I was looking for a roommate he asked if he could stay and lay the rent. I agreed because I need to rent the room and also he's a good friend and I want to help him out. \n\nIt's been a couple of weeks since he moved in. Apparently he hadn't said  to my sister that he was moving with me because she only found out yesterday when we both were at our parent's house. Mom invited us and our other sister to have dinner together, while we were eating mom told me one of her friend's son is looking for a new place and asked me if the room was still available. I said no and I explained my buddy is living with me now. \n\nThen my sister blew up at me for helping her ex out. I told her she can't tell me what to do and that I shouldn't need to rent my extra room to him if she hadn't kicked him out of their shared room. She called me an asshole for telling her that after all he has put her though the baby and such. I told her that honestly any of that is my problem and I want to help my friend, plus I needed to rent the room so why wouldn't I rent it to him? My other sister and mom sided with my sister, I told them they were being over emotional about all of this and whatever happened is already in the past, I won't make my buddy homeless for something that's in the past. They continued arguing until I got sick of it and left. \n\nMy sister and mom texted me later to tell me I should apologize with my sister for allowing her ex to live with me and I should also give him a month or two to find another place and leave. I told them I was not gonna do that and that I was not gonna apologize either, they can't try to control who I allow into my house or not.

If he cheated, was abusive or otherwise a general jerk, then YTA. \n\nI find your lack of concern for the well being of your sister a bit concerning.

And if he was such an AH to your sister, you really should've been on her side.\n\nCalling her emotional over something that happened pretty recent is harsh and unfair. She's allowed to feel emotional after a relationship of three years ends. By the sounds of it, it didn't end on good terms either, which makes you a bigger AH for not figuring out what happened.

Also, you can't just use \"It's in the past\" as a blanket statement. If he'd abused your little sister, but it was in the past, I hope to God  you'd care and *not* want him in your space, out of love and respect for her. She doesn't need to come first, but she should come before him.\n\nEdit: Okay, I see that he cheated and they'd experienced a miscarriage. I guess this really just comes down to family values. If someone put my sister through that, I'd be done with them, because I will always love her more. So based off my values, I'd say YTA.", "YTA you are a bad brother and a bad person", "Oh my god yes, YTA\n\nHe cheated on your sister! After she had recently had a miscarriage! He is trash and so are you. I don\u2019t care that he was your friend before they dated, HE CHEATED ON YOUR SISTER. And you\u2019re living with him now?? You are such an awful brother.", "YTA. Only for this: \n\n> I told them they were being over emotional about all of this\n\nI think this is a understandable emotional level they are at.

Why did your \"buddy\" ask you for a place to stay? Does he have no friends? Family? Coworkers? Hotel room? A car? And Why didn't you call your sister to check in on her and see what was going on first? You just found out that her relationship of years ended, yet your only concern is your \"buddy\"....

Your \"friend\" cheated on your sister after she had a miscarriage and that doesn't register as something she should be \"emotional\" about?", "God this guy fucking sucks! I don't even get along with my brother but I know he shows me more respect than this guy, watch in 5 years he wonders why his sister wants abslouly nothing to do with him.

If one of my friends got with my sister and then cheated on her after she miscarried he wouldn\u2019t be welcome in my home, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nYour sister sucks because she has no right to dictate who you live with. You don\u2019t live at home, you don\u2019t live with your sister, you live alone and were looking for a roommate. Your family has no right to kick him out of your home. If you hadn\u2019t said anything, they\u2019d probably have no idea who your roommate was.", "Men are always gonna put other men first. This is not surprising at all.", "This isn't a black and white situation so I won't say YTA, but I think you should take your mom's advice and give your buddy a month or two to find another place. a) thats plenty of time, he won't be \"homeless\" unless you're giving him some sort of insane deal on rent right now, and more importantly b) your sister is clearly uncomfortable about this, and if your other sister and your mom also are on her side, without knowing anything about this situation, I would take that as an enormous hint that there's some stuff going on in that relationship that you're not privy too. \n\nThis is a difficult situation, so if your barrier for an exit out of this situation is that you don't want to have an uncomfortable conversation with your buddy, you're definitely the asshole. Especially because frankly your buddy should understand that he cant live with his long-term ex's brother for very long. But I get where you're coming from as well.", "NTA he is your buddy and he was your friend before they started dating", "NTA, buddy was your friend first not her partner.. Also \"your house, your rules\" if your parents were those type.... INSANE she has the heart to leave someone she knows homeless.", "NTA, whatever happens between your sister and ex is their problem. He's your friend and what you have is what friends do ie help each other out. Your sister may have her own reasons but she can't tell you who you can or cannot have in your house. Sometimes people use the 'family first' thing to get their way but the same family may not be there when you need them and in most cases its friends who then step in. So well done for standing your ground and don't let someone dictate how you live your life.", "[deleted]", "NTA", "NTA he was your friend first. Your sister doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on your friends, and certainly not a monopoly on you were doing people a favor.\n\nThis is hardly a matter of family comes first. \n\nLike, how does this even impact them?", "ESH - Frankly, your sister chose to date her brother's roommate/friend. So unless they worked out forever, navigating a break-up with her brother's roommate/friend was a chosen path she found worth the gamble. It's not reasonable to expect your friendships with your friends to be affected by whether hers succeeds or not. By that logic, siblings can eliminate friendships of other siblings, which is a pretty wild idea. Why does her 3 years override your 6 years? It doesn't.\n\nYou also seem entirely removed from your sister at all. She's moved awful fast & she's suffering for it. As sad as her miscarriage is, in hindsight this was a bad guy to start a family with obviously. Do you seriously have no negative feelings for this guy cheating on your sister tho? Do you love her & feel sympathy for her? Guys can overlook other guys but *this* guy doesn't respect *you* if he's willing to treat your family in hurtful ways. He is perfectly fine breaking up with your sister & expecting no repercussions from you. But this guy chose to treat his friend's family like trash. Technically, your family & sister are out of line dictating your friendships. You should be having your own opinions here that recognize this guy is a poor friend to keep. Your home should not be his sanctuary from his actions, given these circumstances.", "ESH- I understand you need a roommate but did you know before he moved in all of these things? If not I kind of get why you won\u2019t put him out (not that I\u2019m agreeing with his decision). He\u2019s now considered a tenant and they have rights. \n\nI can\u2019t understand your reasoning for picking your friend over your sister because I don\u2019t your family dynamics. I just don\u2019t get anyone here. Don\u2019t date your brother\u2019s friends. This is could be you.", "This will probably get downvoted but I'm going overall NTA. You were buddies before your sister started dating him. What did she think would happen if the relationship didn't work out? You would dump him if she did? That's a very immature expectation unless there was physical or emotional abuse etc.", "NTA He was your friend first - until there are accusations of abuse, you're allowed to do the same you would do for any friend in his position.", "NTA your friends , his being a shitty partner doesnt make him not your friend being homeless sucks good on you for helping him. sucks for your sister but thats between them. your buddy is a prick for sure but you need someone to rent the room and he needs a room.", "NTA. First of all, it's not like he just randomly decided to take in this guy. The dude had nowhere else to go after being kicked out by his ex-girlfriend, who happens to be the sister of the guy in question. So, what was he supposed to do? Let his friend be homeless on the streets? Come on now, that's not cool.\n\nSecondly, the guy did try to be considerate by not asking too much about the break-up between his sister and her ex. It's not his business to pry and he probably didn't want to get involved in any drama.\n\nThirdly, he's renting out a room in his apartment and his friend is willing to pay for it. Why wouldn't he take the opportunity to make some extra cash and help out a friend in need? It's a win-win situation, folks.\n\nNow, let's talk about the sister's reaction. She's upset that her ex is living with her brother, but again, what was he supposed to do? Just turn him away and let him fend for himself? That's not very brotherly or friendly.\n\nAnd as for the whole \"family comes first\" argument, well, maybe the sister should have thought about that before kicking her ex out. It's not fair to expect her brother to just turn his back on a friend because of some past relationship drama.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this guy is NOT the asshole for letting his sister's ex move in with him. He's being a good friend and helping someone in need, and there's nothing wrong with that. The sister and mom need to chill out and stop trying to control his actions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's their personal matter but you can judge her for dwelling on the past and being emotional? Do you know its not that rare for women to develop ptsd after miscarriages?

If you want to keep a relationship with her and she's important to you then please approach her and ask her to tell you how she's doing, what's been happening exactly, how she's feeling now and how you can help her.
