Also include a general NDA.\n\nI'm concerned that not only will your ex try to gain access to your home again and pump her for information while he's there in the future, he could potentially contact your nanny when she's off work and develop a relationship with her and/or offer her money for information.

Someone experienced with contentious custody arrangements.", "> I cannot blame this nanny because I don't know her age, or training.\n\n\"Don't let this specific person into the house\" is something I'd expect a teenager babysitting for the first time to be able to understand. There's no reason to make excuses for the nanny.", "More a rhetorical question. Your nanny doesnt work for your ex so she has no right to let him in or discuss private things with him", "I think they're asking does she work for like a company or something or did you hire her yourself.", "Also should it happen again, just send the police over", "Did you get her through a service?", "Your nanny is 100% in the wrong and should be fired. That said, I read this as she opened the door, your daughter ran to him, and then she didn\u2019t want to just leave your daughter with him to go somewhere else and grab her phone to contact you. It\u2019s still absolutely a fireable offense and she should not have opened the door, let him in, or answered his questions. But it does logically make sense that once the door was open and your daughter was in his arms she felt like her only options were 1) go in another room and call you, leaving her charge/ your daughter alone with him unsupervised or 2) stay and try to deescalate things to keep an eye on your child and ensure her safety. I still think you should fire her, but I think it\u2019s good to stay aware of how he manipulated the situation for prepping your next nanny (have your phone on your body at all times might be a good additional rule). Once the door was opened and your daughter was in his arms it probably did seem like the wisest choice was to keep the tone friendly and try to prevent kidnapping or him getting angry in front of your child. Not defending her, just pointing out that any competent nanny would stay with the child rather than step out to make a call once the door was open if making that call/ retrieving a phone meant leaving the child with him.", "Yeah, but isn't that what every nanny says under these circumstances?", ">because my daughter ran to him and she wanted to contact me but was staying near my daughter because he knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. Which makes no sense\n\nSo ... yes she messed up letting him in, but at that point it sounds like she was thinking her choices were a) go into another room to call you, leaving your daughter unsupervised with him, or b) stay to make sure she's okay.  (Plus she was probably slightly panicking which makes it hard to think, so \"text OP while supervising interaction\" may not have occurred to her.)\n\nI'm not defending her, just explaining that bit.", "I was a nanny for years and if this is true: \n\n*daughter ran to him and she wanted to contact me but was staying near my daughter*\n\nthen it does make sense. She didn't want to upset the child around her birth father. AND he has every right to see her unless there is a court order or TRO and as a nanny, we do not have the ability or legal right to keep a child away from either parent unless it was arranged by court. Hence if he comes to visit his kid, he legally has the right to do so, which is why both YOU and EX are butting heads. \n\nYou put the nanny in the middle of a custody problem, and she can do nothing about it unless you have a temporary custody order active. Doesn't seem like it if you end up taking work off to chase him away but I don't know the whole ins and outs of this situation. Just basing this off my own experience and what you wrote.\n\nWhile she may be disrespecting your wishes as an employer, she can't disrespect the laws. You can say EX isn't welcome in your home at any time but all he has to do is call a cop and they will tell the nanny she has to let the child out to visit him.\n\nOne statement you made sounds weird. \n\n*I had an argument with him that I didn\u2019t want to have that could have been avoided but he went through my fridge*  \nWhat's wrong with the fridge? Or the items inside it? As nanny's we are mandated reporters (based by state and organization). If we see any kind of abuse (not accusing you or the ex) or see that a parent is suffering from lack of food, old moldy food, excessive alcohol, we speak to the parent first and if it goes nowhere or a problem continues, we have to report it.  \n\nThis nanny may have just let the ex in because she doesn't want to report a suspicion on something she is actually concerned about but also isn't necessarily abuse. She's new to the nanny game or very inexperienced with parents and custody battles.\n\nI don't think you would be wrong for firing her. Afterall, she did not follow your instructions...but at the same time, you're asking someone to be in the middle of you and ex's problems, then expecting her to encourage the child to not see him when he does come around. \n\nHe should by all means only come around when you are there as a courtesy, but there isn't any law other than trespassing (which again is superseded by being the birth father with no court order) that can keep him away from the child. I would weigh that decision carefully and thoughtfully.", "Except you know he is actually dangerous as well as he seems determined to feed her an allergen", "That's tough, and I can see how daycare may be off limits. Both daycare and school should have protocol for this situation, but they either do not or are choosing to ignore it. There is no excuse for the school to not understand how custody works if it's been given in writing. If you do not get an explanation for why staff seem to be struggling with something as simple as custody, go to admin, and keep going up until it's fixed. To me this is simple, he has visitation/time on certain days, and not on others. \n\nI'm sure you've received this advice, but document all of this. If it's not his day, there is no reason for him to be showing up to your home.", "Edit: IANAL  \nYou might want to ask your divorce lawyer about the situation as well - you not firing her might hurt you in the proceedings if something about this incident comes up.", "yeah that was definitely not the way for the nanny to go about it, had the door never been opened to him in the first place (as per your rules) she wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.", "Fire her.", "This is an unbelievably stupid excuse. In the most generous light, she is not experienced or savvy enough to handle complicated custody situations with difficult personalities.", "Yeah, that's exactly it.
