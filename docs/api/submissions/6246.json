Around 5:10pm my wife gets hungry and says on the way home lets stop at snack place (Tim Hortons) and get me a snack sandwich that I like a lot.\n\nI said, no, there is food at home we planned for dinner (6pm), the kids will be required to wait for their food and you therefore need to set the example of what we require of them which is fruits/veggies only close to dinner. She said she'll sneak it so they don't see, I said absolutely not, that is impossible.\n\nShe then claims that because she had an eating disorder when she was much younger that I should let her have her unhealthy snack immediately before dinner in front of the kids and set a bad example/double standard. I say no still. Then she says something along the lines of, I'm going to make you pay for this, in a vindictive tone.\n\n5 minutes later we get ready to leave, sure enough all of the kids are hungry after the jungle gym and I say, wait 45 minutes for dinner, if you are hungry when we get home (30 min drive) there are fruits and veggies you can have before dinner, no one including her took me up on that healthy snack offer.\n\nNow she is claiming I starved her and is giving me silent treatment and refusing to come down for family dinner. I am saying, if I made the kids wait 30 minutes for a healthy snack right before dinner, you are required to wait too to set the example and suck it up. Then of course in anger I go back into her room and told her to grow up, we don't have time to deal with a 37 year old mother of 3 acting like a child over not getting a tasty treat right when she wants it.\n\nObvious solution next time is to have healthy snacks for car ride home, lesson learned there.", "created_utc": 1672621636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100z2hz/aita_wife_wants_double_standard/", "score": 442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That means that you should provide the snack when it is needed instead of forcing them to wait almost an hour, past even when an adult reached her breaking point.\n\nFurther, you seem to think that there's only two options: forcing the kids to go hungry almost an hour or have them \"feeling awful\" and gain weight, never eating a veggie again. No? What the fuck? Just give them a snack. One donut or value fries isn't some kind of mind-control green-phobic fat drug. It's an impromptu, temporarily filling snack. OP could even have popped into a grocery store or gas station for something they felt was even lighter. But the choices he made do not promote good eating habits.\n\nDo not divide food into good and bad, especially with family history of eating disorder. That is a massively dangerous mindset. Just set an example about moderation and portion control. It's not hard and would not have ruined the day. \n\nNo, your children will not thank you for restricting their diets and then getting into an event-ruining fight about it. That's unhealthy and only teaches unhealthy food relationships.", "I have two kids, they know that no food is bad. They do know however, that food has different nutrients in it and some food keeps you fuller for longer. They are active, healthy and are darn good at balancing what they want to eat.  I don\u2019t restrict their food because I\u2019m in eating disorder recovery and have been taught in recovery that good/bad food labels are super harmful.  \n\nMy youngest has pretty killer sensory issues around food, he knows how to listen to his body and make the choices he wants. The deal in our family is any meal or snack needs to have a fruit/vegetable, a starch and a protein. They listen to their bodies. For afternoon snack today one had yogurt, fruit and cheezies. The other had vegetables, cheese and crackers.", "For children it\u2019s best to label all food as just food, you can explain - this provides your body with energy, this provides your body with vitamins, etc. but no, children do not need to be told \u201cthis is bad\u201d or \u201cthis is good\u201d.  Food is just food.", "The understanding of food you are suggesting is like abstinence-based sex education: it isn't scientific, it's based on shame, and it's pretty much proven to work against your goals. You get kids who relate food to shame or other emotions and who cannot listen to their bodies' needs. So they overeat. This is also seen in your inability to see that there's more options than \"restrict food massively\" and \"omg they're gonna get FAT!\"\n\nThe \"not-labelling\" thing is newer and based in science. Like actual sex education, it relies on teaching children science-based reality about the food they are eating so they can make reasonable choices. \n\nA good parenting choice here would be to get everyone in the car a small snack, in a reasonable portion size, to tide them over until dinner. You don't treat that snack as evil or particularly wonderful, you just make sure it's enough that they can make it to dinner. What that models is listening to your body's cues and making responsible food decisions based on those needs instead of ignoring the body until cravings are overwhelming.", "Unless they're napping from all the jumping around", "Incorrect", "She didn't say that. OP did. She said \"Let's stop for a snack\" OP said no because the kids can't have one (notice wife didn't say the kids couldn't have one).

I suspect mom would have been fine getting them a snack but OP was pretty insistent that they can only have fruits and veggies.", "Rules that are clearly enforced by OP", "The bad nearly always ends up put on a pedestal as something not allowed, leading to binge eating, feelings of shame, and rigid rules surrounding food. It is not a good approach to teaching your kids about food. \n\nThis post genuinely feels like the \u201cunified front\u201d is OP\u2019s opinions and his wife doesn\u2019t get a choice.", "I\u2019d have lost my appetite if my partner treated me like that.", "Thanks for the response!", "Had to Google purse because we call it a handbag here, but that makes a lot of sense, thank you.", "Thanks for the explanation, I don't know much/anything about parenting, although I can certainly see the logic in keeping nappies and food around.", "He is not refusing to let her eat it, he is refusing to stop and get it for her.", "Yeah sorry but that\u2019s not how reality works. If she had prepared a meal for the family and he goes \u201cyou know what honey; I\u2019m gonna go out and get some wagyu beef to grill up for myself while you and the kids eat your spaghetti\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019d be the unreasonable one and she\u2019d be \u201crefusing\u201d him food", "Definitely ESH.

I'm not sure if you've been through a Timmy's drive through on new years day around dinner time, but if it's anything like the one I was in, no one's eating at 6 if they stopped at 5:15.", "I'm very happy you're in recovery from your ED, I know that's incredibly hard work. I just don't think it's bad to tell kids no to food that has very limited nutritional value but IS engineered to be hyper-addictive. Kids get addicted to these highly processed highly addictive foods which can have absolutely disastrous outcomes to their health in the long term if it becomes habitual. I respect your perspective having experience with your ED, I'm a recovering bulimic myself, but the fact of the matter is that kids are just by the numbers far far more likely to end up with childhood obesity and diabetes, and any number of other negative health outcomes if they eat poorly on a consistent basis. Kids WILL bully parents to try and get their way to the addictive sugary and processed foods, a parent has to be able to say no.", "\"Why is there an obesity and diabetes epidemic?

Processed foods are addictive,  I just typically don\u2019t have them in my house for my kids to pick from. I also will try to get the kids to add more balance if they are eating the processed food. Typically my kids eat super healthy, however we have also had times where all my youngest would eat was starch. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but I wasn\u2019t going to let him starve because he couldn\u2019t handle the food in front of him. \n\nI think that kids knowing some foods give you more nutrients and will fill you up for longer is important. I just mean that specifically using good/bad is not ideal.  I think that balance is important.  \n\nOne of my kids is an incredibly talented young chef, the way she talks about nutrients is incredible. She does binge junk food on occasion, but she will stop when her body feels yucky.", "Oh lord \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019m not going to bicker with someone who is fatphobic about why the \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d is made up bull shit to freak people out.", "Lots of assuming going on here to defend abusive behavior... strange.", "She said that AFTER he mentioned enforcing \"their\" rules about fruits and veggies.
