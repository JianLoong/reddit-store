I told him that was fine and that I was available at 5 p.m. I suggested a new taco spot in town he was on board. Then he asked me if I wanted to pick him up or meet him there. I said I would meet him there. As time went through the day we were flirting and having some laughs through texts, he said hey do you mind if we change the location to a local pizza place that he hasn\u2019t tried before, since I\u2019m flexible I said sure, but I noticed this place is close to his house, unlike the taco place that\u2019s in the middle. But I wasn\u2019t phased so we talked off and on, around three hours before the date he jokingly asked me if I could help him with something. I asked what he needed help with, he responded his work \ud83d\udc40 I was shocked by this but replied only if I was getting paid. He laughs and then states I need my money cause I\u2019m broke and I only have $100 to last the rest of the week. When heard that I said to him if you are worried about later I planned on covering myself. To which he responded are you going to cover me too? I said no!  He laughs and then says to be these bills are kicking my ass. I know however I have bills and children that I care for he is single no kids so I told him to miss with that foolishness. Needless to say, I canceled the date and told him I didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore because it was the newest addition to his patterns of negative behaviors. He got upset with me and said \u201cYou are going to do me like this?\u201d I told him: my response was a reaction to your behavior if you don\u2019t like my reaction maybe you should check your behavior. \n\nAm I the asshole for calling the date off and asking him not to contact me anymore", "created_utc": 1699485346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qyoxw/aita_for_canceling_the_date/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
