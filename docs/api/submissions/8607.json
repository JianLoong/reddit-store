She did most of this while being in the UK, living on \u00a34 a week, then becoming a single mother when I was 3. \r\n\r\nAll my mum wanted was their love. But how did they repay her? They hid money that she\u2019d inherited, sold her dead mother\u2019s prized possessions (the siblings have a different mum), and, for years, one of my aunts pretended she was the one providing money my mum had sent to the family. \r\n\r\nThe siblings apologised in 2020 when my mum showed them spreadsheets of the money she\u2019d sent them over 30+ years .\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re improving, but it's hard for me to build a relationship cus my mum doesn\u2019t want them to have my number.
