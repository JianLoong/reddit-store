Every room in the house can potentially be monetized. A room if rented out can earn us $800 a month for example. So my brain was in hyperdrive constantly trying to make sure I made use of every corner.\n\nI don't think that way now but maybe you need to communicate with your partner about this.

Does anyone have that issue because that's messed up?", "Does it no longer imply cowboy?", "Lol yup been with my s/o for 15 years and if I say partner people think I'm a lesbian. I was specifically told not to say that term. It's so weird.", "I feel Like when people who are many decades past being able to seriously call themself 'girl' or 'boy', refer to their Partner as boyfriend/girlfriend, it's MORE of a statement about their Level of commitment (or, Lack thereof), than when twenty-somethings who live together and may be planning to get married at some point, use the Same words. Like, that elderly couple (late 70s/early 80s), who had been Dating for years but didn't want to Join households because of how much effort it would be to downsize and move, and were living in neighboring villages on different Sides of the German-Danish Border and used to visit each other everyday, and then when the Border was closed for months in the First COVID year, they both are Lunch and afternoon-coffee at a Picknick Tablet at the Border every day to spend time with each other. THAT'S an appropriate use of the words,  an old lady Girlfriend and her old man Boyfriend.", "Owning a house together is a much bigger commitment, to me, than marriage. My partner and I have done the former now for decades, but never bothered with the latter. YMMV, I guess.", "Maybe because some people don't need a paper with a stamp to be a family?", "Thank you for voicing the very thoughts I often have reading these subreddits. Kids and mortgage yes, but not ready for marriage??!!", "Certainly not though in the UK. Here, despite what people assume, living together short or long term does not constitute marriage, common law or otherwise. Unless of course you've actually legally married each other. Too often it only becomes a problem when there's serious illness, death, separation etc and then it's discovered that there are no rights with regard to the other person or property.", "Personally I use SO to cover all forms of romantic relationship from boy/girl/NBfriend to married.", "I was going to reply saying that. It's less typical, or at least used to be, but \"partner\" is an acceptable term for a spouse. It's particularly good if one doesn't know the legal status of another couple's relationship.", "HA, same though!\ud83d\ude02 Whether it be a queer relationship and/or a poly relationship, 'partner' just seemed to have its own special meaning to it.\n\nOn a funny note, one time I was with a few friends and people who didn't know me well, and at one point I said, \"I'll see you at the party, I'll bring my partners.\"\n\nAnd one girl, I shit you not, asked me, \"You'll bring your partner's what?\"", "Yes, i'm German and call my SO \"partner\" since we are over 20years together but not married. But most people always go right away to married when they see a pair in our age(42). I don't even care anymore.", "Our daughter has also been living with her 'manpanion' (thanks for that!) for 25 years; we call him our \"un-in-law.\"", "To me (American) if I hear a man call his partner 'the Mrs' it often sounds slightly misogynistic or like a put-down of his partner-- like someone making a ball and chain joke about their partner. But I'm sure that's a generational and cultural thing.", "This comment has made my day. Sounds like something my mom would have done.", "That's also what the Word can be useful for though. If two people who are practically, logistically, each other's most important Person, even If Just for the purpose of SOME social situations, and happen to be heterosexual but single, but Sort of queerplatonically \"with\" each other, and housemates, with partially-joint finances, then it's nobody's Business If they are married, having Sex, both, or neither.", "This made my day!! I think it would be fun to find out stats like that in the afterlife!", "It\u2019s definitely enmeshed with religion but it\u2019s always been a general social and later legal institution. Since it\u2019s been an important part of society any religion that was focused on gaining control over its followers would have a strong interest in monopolizing marriage, but it definitely wasn\u2019t always that way. I\u2019m Ancient Greece there was still some religious element, but it was mostly about making sure the union is auspicious in the eyes of the gods rather than following prescribed rules. \n\nCertainly now it\u2019s hard to pull it free from religion, but the bigger issue is at least in the US marriage makes so many things easier legally. I don\u2019t think any of the benefits can\u2019t be acquired without being married, but it\u2019s definitely a lot more work and if you aren\u2019t really vigilant it\u2019s pretty easy to run into unforeseen issues if you\u2019re not married.", "Where I live---which is Switzerland--being a SAHM without being married leaves you extremely vulnerable in case of a breakup. You're not entitled to alimony at all. You don't get pension credit. It's a very risky proposition and you better hope you never break up because you'll walk away with nothing other than child support.", "I had a friend who lived with her partner for decades. She described him as her husband. One day he decided to propose so she started calling him her fianc\u00e9 joking that he actually downgraded their relationship by doing it.", ">\"You'll bring your partner's what?\n\nLOL! That is hilarious!", "Well that\u2019s adorable!", "That's why I sooo much love the Danish \"k\u00e6reste\" (dearest one). It fits in all age groups :)", "My father used to call my brothers GF his \u201ccompanion\u201d until I told him to knock it off, because it made her sound like a seeing eye dog\ud83d\ude44. Man that used to irritate the living hell out of me.", "But (in Danmark) *samboende* sounds more official.   \nUsually people just use *k\u00e6reste* for both girlfriend/boyfriend and partner, with whom they live, have children and bought a house.", "The different terms used for women in, say, Mexico refer more to the perceived age rather than marital status like in the U.S. In Mexico, a married, young-looking 19 year old would still be \u201csenorita\u201d \u2014 to a stranger, at least. My unmarried, middle-aged self would be \u201csenora\u201d because I don\u2019t look like a senorita! \n\nOne time a Mexican man called me Dona. That was cool LOL", "I\u2019m happily married for nearly ten years but I hate mrs. Back when I was teaching I was \u201cMrs. [Last Name]\u201d and it made me cringe every time I heard it. That\u2019s what people call my mom and grandma. \ud83d\ude2d In my corporate job *everyone* calls everyone else by their first name, even the CEO. It\u2019s much better.", "It has to be cultural. Over here you keep your last name even when you marry, so if you're a married woman you will be called Mrs. Weerty and your husband has a different last name, totally normal.", "As an Australian in a relationship with an English girl \u201cthe Mrs\u201d seems entirely normal and harmless.\n\nI never really thought about how other cultures would perceive it."]}
