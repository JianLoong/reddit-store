You\u2019re at your parents! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, especially with him being out of town. You may like the help with the kids or don\u2019t do well by yourself.

Consider the safety of you and your children, talk to your parents about his attitude if they can help you.", "NTA why does he get to control where you go? Does his money pay for your presence too? This dynamic is messed up. The fact that he earns money doesn\u2019t earn him more say in your relationship. He isn\u2019t the boss or your parent.

Fool me twice, shame on me", "The point of it is to show the guy that 1. Managing kids solo is tough and that 2.

It\u2019s her setting boundaries within his ridiculous rules. Can\u2019t leave the house empty? Fine.
