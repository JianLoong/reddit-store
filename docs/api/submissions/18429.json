The reality is that at every stage in a career, getting jobs and choosing who is on your team is a bit of a messy game of nepotism and who do you all want to work with.\n\nTaking her on and having to now be responsible for being the one correcting her behavior and managing her effect on team morale is a huge job that could lower productivity as much as having her skill set could raise it but the extra work and frustration would ultimately have a neg net effect. At the end of the day you do not know what would have happened but being the leader is making these decisions and continuing to move forward. \n\nThe other important aspect though is that your questioning why you made that decision and the ethics of your choice because if you continue to find yourself in leadership positions, your personal biases on things in regards to race, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic class etc (not saying your awful but most people have biases one way or another and leadership training often includes implicit bias classes) could actually lead to situations where you exclude really good and effective candidates because you of your own, sometimes unknown, feelings.\n\nBut in this case, I think you had fair reason to not recommend her for the job.", "That's a bs answer and you know it.\n\nI actually work in IT.

She isn\u2019t hurting others. She clearly just doesn\u2019t see that what she is doing is making others not want to work with her.  \n\nI\u2019ve been there. I was that person.

She may not realise how her behaviour is impacting her reputation as she may well have had this behaviour tolerated or even encouraged in her home life.

But pay careful attention to your reasons for disliking someone in the future, because *being* successful, *talking about* being successful, and *actively sabotaging* a colleague, are very, very different things that you seem to be conflating as equally damning.", "Nta\n\nShe maybe good at perfecting her work, she\u2019s not a team player though. She will have to learn the hard way clearly\u2026", "NTA, she sounds insufferable", "\"alluding that he\u2019d fail and that his work wasn\u2019t up to par with hers.\"\n\n\n\n\"she told others to go with her idea instead because her grade was higher than the other girls.\"\n\n\n\n\"Laughed at someone who was failing design because she thought it was absurd someone would fail an art class, then \u201coffered help\u201d and ghosted him.\"\n\n\n\n\"\u201cAccidentally\u201d spilled paint all over my design layouts after the professor used my work as an example to improve a section of hers.\"\n\n\n\nIn your post you downplay all this stuff, which makes you look like an AH when you aren't. NTA but gosh did you not do yourself any favours in the original post.", "NTA\n\nYou did not block someone who is better than you. You blocked someone who will have a very negative impact on everyone in your working environment. You made the right call.", "NTA - You were asked for your opinion and you gave an opinion based on your many observations of this woman having a negative impact on people. She could legit be the smartest person in the world with the greatest skills ever witnessed by living being, but that doesn't necessarily mean she could function well as part of a team. Your observations of her let you know exactly why she'd be bad on a team and you gave your opinion based on that. You did nothing wrong.", "Initially, i was thinking ESH but with the added info im leaning towards NTA\n\nyou were definitely not in the wrong for giving your opinion, she might be the best and the brightest but team dynamics and teamwork is also crucial and i agree with you there.\n\ni have met people like this and the best way i dealt with it is by distancing myself from them and making new friends. all the best.", "What is she supposed to do? Dumb it down tobmake yall feel better ? \n\nThe issue seems to be more with your low confidence than her. She is proud of her accomplishments as she should be and she is competitive because we are in a competitive environment. YTA, not for expressing your opinion but for expecting her to be less proud of herself.", "YTA You see her as a threat because she's better than you, and you are doing whatever you can to get the edge on her.", "Read the edit. She\u2019s condescending and has reputation for ruining someone\u2019s work when it was used as an example to improve hers or, straight up putting peoples accomplishments down only to boast about hers in the same breath. OP said they would bring morale down, and they\u2019re not wrong, people are becoming deeply affected as OP explained that when they said a classmate broke down in tears and the consensus during that discussion is that she doesn\u2019t play nice with others.", "Are her accomplishments verified, or does she just say she did this or that?\n\nNTA", "Well that seems like someone actually trying to help, no? If I've been there and could help, offering experience is annoying?", "Doesn't sound like she's good at teamwork anyway.", "As a woman who has fought hard to be recognised in a male dominant industry for over a decade, I agree with this. \n\nHowever.. fighting hard to be recognised shouldn't include stepping over other people to get there. You ever tear others down in order to prove your worth. Kinda sounds like that's what this girl keeps doing.", "Her behavior sounds obnoxious as either sex.", "Exactly", "NTA many would have resigned just to get away from her. \n\nShe's toxic for the mental health of those she's around.", "In general, people who say \u201cno offense\u201d are unmitigated assholes. That being said, u/bellesavage is entirely correct that women are penalized for confidence and self-promotion while men are usually tolerated. It\u2019s a frustrating double standard. Sure, she\u2019s being obnoxious, and you don\u2019t need to invite her to your lab, but there\u2019s no need to pile on. Ignore her, roll your eyes, or just tell her to be quiet if she says obnoxious stuff around you. Your confidence will knock her off her high-horse.", "That\u2019s all we ever get on AITA, team morale is important too and not playing nice with others can really shoot a team in the foot.
