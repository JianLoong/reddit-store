You telling the manager that you genuinely believe she would demoralize the team due to the evidence of her past behaviors isn't asshole behavior, it's you doing what you think is best for the team.", "Be aware that women are frequently criticised for being self-confident and good at what they do.

The reality is that at every stage in a career, getting jobs and choosing who is on your team is a bit of a messy game of nepotism and who do you all want to work with.\n\nTaking her on and having to now be responsible for being the one correcting her behavior and managing her effect on team morale is a huge job that could lower productivity as much as having her skill set could raise it but the extra work and frustration would ultimately have a neg net effect. At the end of the day you do not know what would have happened but being the leader is making these decisions and continuing to move forward. \n\nThe other important aspect though is that your questioning why you made that decision and the ethics of your choice because if you continue to find yourself in leadership positions, your personal biases on things in regards to race, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic class etc (not saying your awful but most people have biases one way or another and leadership training often includes implicit bias classes) could actually lead to situations where you exclude really good and effective candidates because you of your own, sometimes unknown, feelings.\n\nBut in this case, I think you had fair reason to not recommend her for the job.", "That's a bs answer and you know it.\n\nI actually work in IT.

She isn\u2019t hurting others. She clearly just doesn\u2019t see that what she is doing is making others not want to work with her.  \n\nI\u2019ve been there. I was that person.

She may not realise how her behaviour is impacting her reputation as she may well have had this behaviour tolerated or even encouraged in her home life.

The reason I emphasise you giving a \"professional and honest answer\" and then not belabouring it is because, when you're dealing with someone who is genuinely obnoxious and who genuinely isn't a team-player and destroys the morale and work of those around her, it can be easy to slip into condemning everything she does, even when someone else doing that one thing might be seen as valid.\n\nDon't fall into that trap. One or two of those examples are something that -- taken alone -- probably wouldn't be seen as that bad.
