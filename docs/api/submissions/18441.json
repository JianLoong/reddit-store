Everything was willed to me only, leaving out my 5 siblings. They aren\u2019t happy about this, and are demanding I split equally as it\u2019s what \u201cdad would have wanted\u201d. I have been made out to be a greedy villain to our extended family as they post on Facebook about it constantly.  \n\nI am the youngest child of 6 and I have been financially caring for my father for over 7 years now. I also care for an older disabled sibling (32M).\n\nMy father was very fortunate to own a house, multiple vehicles, and a decent life insurance payout. I was on the deed to the house prior to his passing. The total inheritance for me was around $500k in the house, $60k across a couple vehicles, and $200k for his insurance policy (20k was used to cover funeral expenses). \n\nIt was mere hours after he passed when my siblings began asking about who would get a certain vehicle. My oldest sister also talked about fixing up a few things in the house and putting it on the market to sell a little after. They had no idea I was even on the deed for years. The 4 siblings upset do not live near us, 2 didn\u2019t come to the funeral, and they all only visit about once every year for a couple days. \n\nI was aware the entire time that I would get everything. It had been this way in our family since I was in my 20s. I still have paperwork from previous life insurance plans that lists me as the payout. My father believed me to be the most responsible, that I would also care for my disabled brother after he was gone. They were quite upset to see I\u2019ve known this for years and didn\u2019t mention anything. \n\nI\u2019ve turned to my disabled brother for support, but he can\u2019t really comprehend what\u2019s going on nor does he care. \n\nThey\u2019re reached out to lawyers but mine says everything is pretty solid since I have immense amount of documentation to show this was his decision for almost a decade. However, I feel like I\u2019ll ruin my family if I keep it to myself. \n\nI own a small business and I make a decent living myself so I\u2019ve paid my dads expenses (utilities, phone, etc) for years and allowed him to pay his debts instead. I don\u2019t see why I should have to share with family members who were never around nor did anything for him. I\u2019ve sacrificed relationships, having children, etc.. to care for my dad.
