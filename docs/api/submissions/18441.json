I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA - they abandoned him so they deserve nothing. You took care of your late father for years and he left you everything knowing you\u2019re the only one that cared for him. Your conscience is clear. Your family was already broken, they broke it not you.", "NTA That's what your dad wanted for years. He didn't make that decision with dementia. You were the one there for him.", "NTA", "NTA. Similar thing happened with me and my mom. It will torch your siblings relationship forever. But as long as you didn\u2019t manipulate your dad under duress, it\u2019s what he wanted.", "NTA. This inheritance could be partially used to set up care for your brother. I can tell you now, that it\u2019s very, very expensive. So no, don\u2019t give anyone anything.", "You are clearly nta. Sorry for your loss. Goodluck with the drama, be true to yourself. They can be angry but you dad got what he asked for and it was nice of you to be there for him for so long.", "Do not give them a penny. It\u2019s patently clear that your father did this deliberately so that you could afford to care for your disabled brother, so use the money/house as your father wanted. Your father set this up carefully so that his most vulnerable child would be cared for, you really shouldn\u2019t jeopardise that by splitting up the estate.", "Absolutely NTA, but will not being the asshole be enough for you to be happy having your siblings pissed off at you, and possibly \u201cdisowning\u201d you? If not, maybe work with an advisor to set yourself up financially for the future, and then take the leftover amount and split it among them. They probably still won\u2019t be happy with this, but I do think you should account for the money and time you put into your father and brother. You\u2019d be taking the lionshare as recompense and leaving the scraps for those that had no dealings otherwise. But your siblings are unhappy that life isn\u2019t fair and possibly are having some kind of complex that they\u2019re older than you. You may not be able to make everyone happy and I think it would be best to accept that fact at face value and you have absolutely no control over it.", "YTA to yourself for not having a life and paying your father's bills when he could have done so and then letting your siblings involve themselves when there is no reason. Erase Facebook and go have some fun.", "I'm gonna say YTA. You haven't given any reason they shouldnt have some. You havent said oh my dad hated them and hasnt spoken to them. It seems extremely selfish", "Also why does she have to sacrifice so much to care for her dad? Even at 70 most people are pretty self sufficient", "Hell for all we know they lived in different states or countries and could rarely visit. She was pretty vague", "Are you okay? Too much glue perhaps? Op had a life and it was spent as op saw fit. Just because it's not what you would've done does not make it wrong.", "They don't live nearby, don't visit often, didn't help care for their father and do not help look after their heavily disabled sibling. There's four reasons", ">You haven't given any reason they shouldnt have some.\n\nHow about 'the Dad didn't will them anything'?", "NTA\n\nThey really just want a payout, money. He was their dad, and they couldn't be bothered to help look after him, they couldn't have some of these conversations up front, they couldn't help look after your brother who obviously needs a great amount of care if he can't comprehend or care, and they can't even attend his funeral. \n\nBefore the grave is even settled, they are asking for money. They haven't even grieved for the man! \n\nHere's what you do, you rent some storage units, you put those cars/trucks in them, away from the house and easy access and you never speak of where they are. You lock all your computers and phone with passwords and pins and never for a moment hand them the device to make an emergency call for \"just a minute\". \n\nYou change the locks on the house today. You don't want them visiting and picking up keys or using a bathroom and being gone for 20inutes while someone else chats to you to distract you, only to find out they stole paperwork and commit fraud to get the policy payouts etc.. (forums are filled with horror stories like these and it's then always a case of \"would I be the asshole if I pressed charges over money they stole and they go to jail and their kids won't go to college etc...)\n\nThe house, his will and his insurance policies set you as beneficiary. That's it. Those are literally his decisions and you've a decade of paperwork to prove it! \n\nYou owe them nothing. As sentiment goes, you owe only your father. He made the decisions to leave stuff to you, honor that, keep everything he left you. Anything you give away is generous but unnecessary, not only that you may be tax liable for it and anything you give away is less to care for your brother down the line, don't think short term, what will your finances be like in 10 years or if you have unexpected expenses or an accident.... \n\nThis was your father's plan for you and your brother. \n\nDon't get pulled into the drama or posts online or goaded to respond or feel you need to justify yourself. Sell the trucks this week to a dealer if you have to then it's just \"the trucks are already gone!\" If you have no use for them. \n\nNTA.", "Sell the truck and cars. Put all that into your I am taking care of my disabled brother fund.", "Let them fight, I agree with u/baconator_out - the inheritance is yours as your dad wanted. Do something good with it, invest it, whatever - but it\u2019s yours.", "Your mom's side of the family has no claim to anything. Your father made sure you were the only one to get anything from his estate. He did that for a reason. YWBTA if you go against his wishes.", "Any family member that is willing to put you down for money and greedy or for their own gain does not deserve to be called family. If they are willing to throw away the family relationship for the sake of a bit of land let them do exactly that and stick to your father's wishes.", "Does any of that matter? She's still the one who sacrificed her life and finances to care for her dad and brother, and this is recompense for that.", "So because they dont live nearby and cant see their father as often they shouldnt get anything???? Why did a 70 year old even need care?", "This! True! Excellent advice.", "While this is absolutely the right advice, I don't  encourage OP to do what I'm about to say, petty me would sign over the truck to both of them and then let them fight it out between themselves."]}
