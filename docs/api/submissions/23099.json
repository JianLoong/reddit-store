I have been the one to wake him up several times when I notice he's sleeping in. He has his first alarm at 7, then one at 7:10, he has to leave at 7:45 max if he wants to get to his workplace by 8am.\r  \n\r  \nI work from home, I'm a freelancer, so I have no need to wake up that early. On the times I realized he hasn't moved from bed and it's past 7:30, he would get really mad when I woke him up, yelling \"Why didn't you wake me up sooner???\".\r  \n\r  \nToday I woke up at 7am by his alarm clock, as we sleep together. He woke up, turned it off, and went back to sleep like he usually does until the 7:10 alarm. Then he turned off the 7:10 alarm and went back to sleep again.\n\nI wasn't really paying attention to the time, but I was using my phone as some clients were texting me already. I kept looking at my boyfriend from time to time, and he would open his eyes at me, smile, and nod, then close his eyes again. \r  \n\r  \nHere's where I might be the a-hole... I checked the time and it was already 7:37. I look at him calmly, he smiles, and I ask \"do you know what time is it?\", to which he answered \"probably 7:25 or so\", then he took his phone and saw it was 7:37 and rushed off to the bathroom, slamming the door.\n\nAs he was putting his clothes on, he was arguing \"It's an a-hole move of yours to not tell me the time earlier, because of that i'm going to be late and will leave without even brushing my teeth!\".\n\nI told him that I didn't mean to make him pissed off, but that being on time for HIS work isn't MY responsibility, to which he said \"if you are awake and capable of helping out, but you decide not to, then you are an a-hole\".\r  \n\r  \nI get that we are a couple and should help each other, and he's the one paying for all the food and half the bills, so the last thing I want is for him to lose his job because of tardiness.\n\nI was not troubled about being an a-hole until the moment he retaliated back at me in a pretty nasty way: before leaving for work in a rush, he blew his nose on my favorite towel (leaving boogers on it) and said \"you have that white towel on the bathroom to make it look pretty, right?\".\n\nHe's in a general a very good partner, so I was appalled that he would retaliate like that, which made me rethink if I should just keep waking him up if he sleeps in, as I'm already awake and I'm capable of doing it.", "created_utc": 1690290698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15985o4/aita_for_not_waking_up_my_boyfriend_for_work_in/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is an adult and is capable of getting out of bed on time. I would tell him if he ever retaliates in such a disgusting manner again that he will be packing his bags and leaving. That is not acceptable behaviour under any circumstances. He is punishing you for his inability to get himself up on time. This type of abusive behaviour will escalate.\n\nedited to add, he is teaching you that you will be very sorry if you don't do what he wants.", "NTA\n\nHe's snapping at you and blaming you for his childish behavior.  You didn't sign up to be his mommy.  When you alarm goes off, you get up.  You don't put the burden of waking you up on your partner.  BF is an AH.", "Is he 35 or 12? Cause he sounds like a child. I'd just leave him sleeping until he wakes up, if he wants to get fired that's his choice. There's morning I fucking hate my alarm but get my ass out of bed anyway because I'm an adult and I have to work.", "NTA - Your BF is being an AH. He is an adult and he is responsible for getting himself out of bed in time to get to work. It is not your job to wake him up. That is what alarms are for. What if you decide to sleep in one morning? What if you are awake, but busy with your own job and not paying attention to the time? Is he just going to be late? Will it be your fault for not being awake to wake him up? \n\nIf he had accidently forgotten to set an alarm and you noticed and didn't wake him up - that would be an AH move. But he seems to have unilaterally decided that making sure he gets up on time is now your responsibility and he doesn't have to worry about hitting snooze on his alarms or keeping an eye on the clock in the morning. \n\nYes, couples should help each other - but that does not mean that he can just decide that you are responsible for something without your agreement and then get pissy when you don't do it.\n\nAnd him using your nice towel as a snot rag in \"retaliation\" is beyond petty and a pretty serious red flag.", "NTA. He's looking for a mommy, not a partner. The petty retaliatory behavior with the towel is a major red flag. He just disrespected you in a major way.", "Nta.  Break up with him. AYou're not his mom and he's not a 5 year old. So many red flags. I'd be worried about how he will retaliate in the future when you won't/can't do what he wants.", "NTA. While helping each other in a relationship is important, it's not your responsibility to ensure he wakes up on time for work. You have tried to help in the past, and he has reacted negatively when you woke him up earlier. \n\nHis retaliation by being rude and disrespectful is not acceptable and shows a lack of maturity in handling conflicts. \n\nHe should take responsibility for his own punctuality and not take his frustrations out on you.", "NTA.  How did he get to work before he moved in with you? He can do that now. You're not his mommy.", "NTA. You're his partner, not his mother. If it happened on occasion, I'd be fine with a gentle poke and telling him the time. But it sounds like this happens all the time and he genuinely thinks it's your job to wake him up if he's sleeping in too late. His response was also super childish and petty.\n\nI'd have a calm conversation with him about this and let him know you won't be responsible for him getting up on time. Also, pay attention to his reactions to irritations in the future because if he makes a habit of \"retaliating\" when he gets upset, I'd be reconsidering my relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s 35. As in he has been an adult for more than a decade. He should be able to get up on his own. And blowing his nose on your towel just to be petty, again he is 35, not 5! You should not change your behaviour because of his retaliation! He should not retaliate like a child! You two need to have a proper conversation about this, because this can\u2019t go on.", "I am amazed at people who point some horrible red flags in their partners and then say but in general they\u2019re good. Nobody is perfect, but no good person is lazy, entitled, and vindictive. Gather his stuff and change the locks. He moved in with you and put the burden on you . Please don\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t contribute to the household chores because \u201cit\u2019s an engineering job\u201d and he\u2019s so tired. Please please don\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t contribute financially. NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not his mommy and he\u2019s not an 8 year old going to school. It\u2019s not your duty to make him get up and get ready for work. He\u2019s an adult who should be taking care of his schedule. I\u2019d suggest sleeping in separate rooms if his alarm waking you up is a problem for you.", "NTA he's a grown up. Do grown up things", "NTA. Being on time for work or anything else is a personal responsibility. It\u2019s time to sit him down and tell him that you will no longer notify him of the time and if he oversleeps it\u2019s his responsibility to deal with the consequences. There\u2019s absolutely no reason why he cannot set an alarm and get out of bed on time. I would also tell him if he ever does anything as petty and disgusting as blowing his nose on your towels again he can start looking for his own place to live.  He is an AH for expecting you to get him out of bed and for such childish behavior.", "NTA\n\nWouldn't it be great if there was a device that could remind us its time to get up.... Like a clock or a phone.  Then you can be self-reliant.  Oh he has this!!!!!  Instead he goes.... I know I need to get up, I set an alarm and hit snooze and then do it again BUT it's your fault for not waking up!!!!!  Nope!!  You are not his insurance policy against self inflicted stupidity/laziness.  It's like when someone says remind me to do something important, that you have NO RESPONSIBILTY to do, and then they blame you if they miss their deadlines.\n\nHis reprisal was soooo low class and disgusting as well.  He needs to go to sleep earlier, or get some sleep therapy if he is unable to wake up when he needs to.  (Best practice,.... Don't use snooze, just shower.", "NTA, he is a grown man who doesn't need mommy to wake him up.", "NTA. It' s quite worrying that his first thought was to retaliate. Especially in a way that I'm pretty sure is not appropriate for a 35yo man...", "NTA  I agree that blowing snot on your pretty towel is a red flag. I had an ex like this. He stole my favorite shoes and threw them out of a car window. He went to retrieve them only after I called his mom and told on him lol. You might need to call your boyfriend\u2019s mom. He seems like he\u2019s still at that level", "NTA. Your boyfriend is though. He wants to sleep in and not be on time, which is his fault. If he wants to turn to pettiness, tell him living together isn\u2019t working out and you want to live separately. Punishing you for his tardiness and inability to manage his time is not your fault.", "NTA.  He's a grown man, even if his actions would seem to indicate otherwise.  If he can't get up to his alarm, then he should ask you to wake him.  And he should ask nicely.", "ESH. He for obvious reasons. You for, yes, not waking him up sooner. Many here are talking about how you're not his parent and that's true. But in a relationship, you communicate and compromise. Sit him down and ask him what exactly it is he wants you to do and at what time. Then you can decide if that's something you're willing to do. 'Okay, so you want me to wake you up if you're not in the bathroom by 0730. If I'm awake, I can do that. But I'm not going to set alarms to make sure I'm awake at that time.' Or whatever you both decide. But sit down and talk about and decide what you both want to do. Or not.", "ESH.

He doesn't wake up when his alarm goes, while I'm already up with the children, and I often hear his alarm ring for 3 minutes straight without him turning it off.\n\n\nBut with my husband, this changed when I told him in a calm moment that waking him up makes me feel like a) his mother, b) his maid or c) living with my teenage brother again. - Now, he (usually) gets up in time, and he NEVER blames me for oversleeping.\n\n\nYour boyfriend's reaction is horrible, and I'd make HIM do the laundry with the towel he wiped his nose on, and THEN break up with him for blaming you for HIS mistakes.", "NTA.

Likewise sometimes my bf works a late night due to a midnight tech deployment and takes off the next morning as comp. Again, occasionally I'm not sure and softly checkin with him, but largely I assume he's sleeping late on purpose. \n\nThe fact that your bf expects you to be his living alarm clock already made him an AH.

He\u2019s not blaming it on me for not waking him up earlier.  In a relationship I probably would also try to wake them up at a regular time and if they didn\u2019t do it then that\u2019s on them.

Maybe you both need to have a hard conversation about your wants and needs and his wants and needs and how you both can compromise. This might make you closer even though right now it sucks. So just work on growing and learning from this experience for the future.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT your fault though.  He sucks ass for telling you that.  You know how he should\u2019ve approached you? He should\u2019ve said \u201cnext time can you try to wake me up at such and such time if you notice?\u201d And then just go on about his day and go to work.

At 7 you wake him up by ripping his blanket (sorry. Non english native\u2026) off and stand there with a water gun telling him to get up or else. Make him some kids serial and pack him a lunch box and then kiss him on the cheek when he leaves and tell him to come home straight after work and be a good boy. \n\nSeriously. If he don\u2019t take the hint just kick him out. Blowing his nose as revenge?! Not even my 5yo does this anymore!!! Not partner-for-life material!", "So are you supposed to never go somewhere early or stay with a friend for the night? After all, it\u2019s apparently now your responsibility to get him up and to kindergarten, sorry I meant work, on time. \nHe has time to get your towel and blow his nose, but not enough time to grab his toothbrush and brush his teeth instead? He\u2019s trash.", "NTA, I\u2019d this was one of the first few times I\u2019d say Y T A but he only got this job 2 months ago and this has already happened multiple times? His terrible time management isn\u2019t your problem and imo he needed something to go wrong to realize how much more seriously he needs to take the situation.", "I am just trying to make sure I am getting this right:\n\n1)  You have no reason to get up before 8:00 (or later) in the morning,  but you regularly do because your bf's \\***multiple**\\* alarms awaken you.\n\n2) In the past,  when bf's multiple alarms have awakened you, and yet he still does not get up, you have awakened him so that he can get to his new job,  and his response was to yell at YOU.\n\n3)  After you became gun-shy from the yelling and thus did not tell him the time as he dozed, when he awoke, he yelled at YOU,  called YOU an ahole,  and then punished you further for HIS error by damaging (temporarily) something that belonged to you.\n\nAnd now, OP,  you are wondering if YOU are the ahole?  Nopety nope nope.  NTA.  He is gaslighting you  (making you doubt the reality you know to be true--  which is that it is HIS repsonsibility as an adult to get up on time...).  You should not tolerate this.  You do not have to break up with him over this single thing,  but you should not tolerate this kind of behavior (1, 2, 3 or gaslighting).  And you should really try to look at the relationship objectively and figure out if it really is just this one thing or if there are lots of other red flags that you are dismissing.", "NTA - if it were me, I\u2019d tell them up front I\u2019d wake them up if they didn\u2019t get up on their first alarm. Otherwise if I\u2019m able to (cause you got a life/work) and I notice it\u2019s 7:30 and you\u2019re still not up I will, but I can\u2019t be responsible for you going back to sleep\n\nOn a total side note, his difficulty getting up in the morning and repeated excessive \u201csnoozing\u201d could be signs of a sleep disorder. He may want to talk to his Dr and possibly do a sleep study", "NTA time for another Reddit divorce", "Please get out. Anyone retaliating on you for their own stupidity will only get worse the longer the relationship goes. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your bf needs to grow up and become more mature. That includes taking responsibility for his own actions, such as not getting up for his work. Blaming your for his actions is not acceptable. Retaliating against you is not acceptable.", "Nta. You are not his mother waking him up for school everyday. He is a grown man with a job.", "You need to sit him down tonight and call out just how 100% unacceptable his behavior was today. Don't name call. Don't debate. Stay calm. Just state: \"you will not treat me like this again. This is not the type of behavior I'll tolerate in a partner and if it happens again, I will leave\". It's then his responsibility to do the hard work, learn, and grow up. Or not. But it is not your fault.\n\nI had to have a similar conversation with my now-husband. He realized I would walk away and he couldn't treat me like his friends treated their girlfriends. It is hard, but worth it", "Y'all want to give him another chance? No thank you.\n\nHe already had several strikes of not being kind to her when she was the one doing *him* the favor, but now that he retaliated in such a way, that's game over. There's no unringing this bell - he's a disgusting asshole with no possibility of redemption in my eyes. \n\nA punishment?!? for your partner?!? that's textbook abuse in anyone's eyes.", "He's also deliberately playing with words here. It's good and healthy for partners to help each other out when in a time of need. Like, if he forgot to turn his alarm on, or exceptionally didn't hear it. \nBut he is basically asking you to be responsible for him waking up every day. He's setting this up as being the new normal. \n\nAlso him retaliating is super nasty (both literally and figuratively).", "Agreed. This crossed the border into potential abuser when he retaliated. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do what I want, I will ruin a thing you love.\u201d And it really is just what he wants, since he was surely capable of waking himself up before OP moved in. At least it was just a towel this time. I could see it escalating to OP\u2019s clothes, then violence toward OP or a child or pet. \n\nNTA but OP please move out now and dump this piece of trash.", "I have a theory that you're from US, and everyone with the same opinion too, are you? It's just something I'm noticing on reddit and would like to know if it's true", "NTA 100%. It\u2019s one thing to be a bit annoyed that your partner didn\u2019t wake you up - unreasonable, and it\u2019s not your responsibility to do it, but sure, I can understand it. But to retaliate like that is disgusting and childish and I would be really surprised if there weren\u2019t other red flags with this guy. No otherwise normal and mature person would respond that way.", "She's not his mother....", "Yes, when someone shows you who they are, you'd better believe them.", "Nta for sure. Tell him he is grown and needs to manage his time. The way he responds to that will tell you if he is worth keeping.", "How is that a burden?? She is in bed, interacting with him already. She wakes him up already by simply saying what time it is, she just chooses to do it only when he is already late", "Even my 6 yr old wouldn't retaliate this way. He has no respect for her.", "yeah like if there was an accident and no alarm went off bc phone died/wasnt charging or something, then youd be an asshole but IGNORING and turning it off everyday is not a mistake! \n\nBUT even then if there were 10 *genuine* mistakes in a row: get it together dude wtf! NTA", "He's not even an asshole, he's a 35 yo LOSER who can't even get to his job on time.", "yeah, his retaliations will only get worse\n\ndon\u2019t tolerate it \n\nnta", "This sub is the most overreactive group of children that always tell the OP to break up or get a divorce, but holy shit he blew snot on your towel because you didn\u2019t wake him up hard enough? I might join the divorce train on this one.", "As an engineer this is a total load of crap. Our jobs are not so bad we can\u2019t be nice human beings. He\u2019s tired bc he doesn\u2019t go to bed on time. That\u2019s on him. If my spouse snorted on my towel like that their ass would be on the curb. If they did it before we were married we never would have gotten married. What the hell is wrong with this dude?  OP you can do better. Please do.", "You could just read the post lol, she literally mentions he pays half the bills and all of the food", "I could maybe overlook the asking to be woke up thing, *if* he were only setting one alarm and had a tendency toward being a heavy sleeper. But blowing his nose on my towel? \n\nI know people sometimes have to take care of sick partners and see some gross stuff, but this is literally like one of my sister\u2019s kids throwing a tantrum. And I\u2019m not sexually attracted to children.", "She said he pays for food and half the bills. So not rent free. Doesn't make it better, actually makes it harder to kick him to the literal curb legally, but FYI.", "Yeah, if my husband wants to make SURE he wakes up, he asks me to set an extra alarm and wake him up. I am a marathon snoozer, so he knows the best he'll get is a tap on the shoulder, a hug, and an announcement of the time, and then I go back to sleep.\n\nAnd vice versa if I need to wake up. \n\nBut this is an occasional occurrence. If I oversleep, he lets me. Because it's my responsibility to get up on time.", "> I checked the time and it was already 7:37. I look at him calmly, he smiles, and I ask \"do you know what time is it?\", to which he answered \"probably 7:25 or so\"\n\nThere is no lie in that statement. She just asked him if he knew what time it was. She didn\u2019t lie about the time", "How did she lie???", "... you completly ignore that he screams at her when she does \"just say\" something...", "i hope you\u2019re joking", "That goes right out the damn window when she wakes him at 7:30 and his response is anger and blaming her for not waking him sooner. His second alarm was at 7:10. He's showing zero effort to try and prevent himself from tripping in the first place.", "He blew his nose on a white towel like a lunatic. NTA", ">why cant you nudge him and tell him what time it is before it's too late?\n\nBecause in the past he would still be angry with her for \"waking him too late\" at 7:30. She was being helpful. He was being rude. What possible reason would anyone have to continue helping someone and only be met with insults and anger?", "So much this. Sure, he's an adult and should be getting up on his own but is it really any skin off her back to give him a little nudge and be like \"it's 7:30 you should get up\" if she's already awake?", "That\u2019s what turned the story for me. At first I thought OP was a bit of an AH for not waking him up even though she could have (not that it\u2019s her responsibility to do so, but if it\u2019s easy and a nice thing to do for someone you love why not?), but then his reaction was way over the top.", "And will be useless trying to share parenting duties one day", "Definitely a hill to die on because if OP gives a pass on this he will know he can do this disrespectful bs whenever he wants.", "He's snapping at you and blaming you for his childish behavior.", "I'd have a calm conversation with him about this and let him know you won't be responsible for him getting up on time.", "Especially if you retaliate in such a childish way.", "And he is THIRTY-FIVE, well past the age he should be getting his own lazy ass out of bed.", "100% agree. My bf is terrible at sleeping through his alarms for work. He\u2019ll set 5-10 alarms and has missed every single one of them before. We agreed that if he missed his alarm, that\u2019s on him. I will admit, more often than not his alarms annoy me, so I\u2019ll wake him up. \n\nYes, we talked about this and have since come up with a solution that works. \n\nLong story short, OP, def talk to your bf about this!", "I agree.\n\nHe's not a good partner \"otherwise\". \n\nThe blowing his nose on your towel is so disrespectful that if you stay, you are communicating  with him his behavior is acceptable. \n\nLeave!", "He\u2019s already gotten mad at her in the past for waking him up but not early enough for him to get ready. And now this? There is no future with him - things will only get worse the more commingled their lives get.   \n\nUnless I\u2019m misreading the post, she was living there and he moved in after getting a new job. So nothing  will change considerably with her life if she gives him the boot. Except having to go back to paying all the bills she seems to have been paying just fine. She\u2019ll lose that half of the rent, but also lose 200lbs of totally unnecessary baggage.", "Right there with you. He's shown who he is and she needs to pay close attention. This is aggressive abusive behavior. He is making mistakes and blaming her, then retaliating when she won't comply with his demands. No discussion, no compromises, no gratitude. He can pound sand.", "So, in other words, you think the BFs behavior is appropriate, then?", "That and the multiple alarms. He\u2019s making himself tired because his body is just hitting a good doze again when the next alarm goes off. Just set it for the latest time and go to bed at a decent hour.", "Right??? Where\u2019s the lie? And it was all of 12min later than what he had hoped. Someone who cuts it that close and got super angry about those extra 12min is not going to become a responsible adult anytime soon.", "Apparently he is an adult who is INCAPABLE of getting up on time. But I completely agree with you - she's not his mom and that's not her problem.", "And get yelled at again like all the times before? Her efforts to help him in the past have resulted in him yelling at her. Thanks but no thanks.", "This right here, if OP wants children, this is not the type of man to go down that path with.  Could you even imagine?", "Redditors try not to turn \"He's not a morning person and has trouble waking up\" into \"He'll be a terrible father, proven facts\".  \n\n\nHes was lazy, and a jerk for it. Op coulda nudged him sooner, but its not their job to, and unless they purposefully stared at the time knowing he needed to be up at 25 and still wasn't, then its not their fault he didnt. Its nothing deeper then that, lets not act like we know his brain based on one singluar post from someone else.", "[removed]", "Agreed! I'd suggest next time his alarm wakes you up, get dressed and go a 45 minute walk. Bet he'll get up at his second alarm if you're not there! Maybe drop a few \"I'm thinking of going for walks to start my day off with some fresh air\" in the days before, and leave a note just so he's not worried where you are (don't wanna make that an argument!)", "Bot. Stolen comment", "I usually have to wake up earlier than my husband. I use a vibrating alarm so I don't wake him up. That's how that works.", "And it's deliberate, premeditated disrespect. He looked for something of hers that he knows she has just because it makes her happy to have a nicely decorated bathroom, and he tried to ruin that to teach her a lesson. I'd be willing to call that more than just disrespectful, that's malicious.", "Absolutely. His behavior will escalate.", "I think it's disgusting, if I was him I would just not talk to her for days and really think if I want to stay on a marriage where my partner can't even help me with saying \"hey, it's 7:30, good morning\" something that wouldn't be any trouble at all. To me ESH both of them, but I can't find my comment  to edit \ud83d\ude2d", "Technically, if OP wants children she\u2019s already got one", "This is exactly what I said!
