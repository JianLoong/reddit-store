I have been the one to wake him up several times when I notice he's sleeping in. He has his first alarm at 7, then one at 7:10, he has to leave at 7:45 max if he wants to get to his workplace by 8am.\r  \n\r  \nI work from home, I'm a freelancer, so I have no need to wake up that early. On the times I realized he hasn't moved from bed and it's past 7:30, he would get really mad when I woke him up, yelling \"Why didn't you wake me up sooner???\".\r  \n\r  \nToday I woke up at 7am by his alarm clock, as we sleep together. He woke up, turned it off, and went back to sleep like he usually does until the 7:10 alarm. Then he turned off the 7:10 alarm and went back to sleep again.\n\nI wasn't really paying attention to the time, but I was using my phone as some clients were texting me already. I kept looking at my boyfriend from time to time, and he would open his eyes at me, smile, and nod, then close his eyes again. \r  \n\r  \nHere's where I might be the a-hole... I checked the time and it was already 7:37. I look at him calmly, he smiles, and I ask \"do you know what time is it?\", to which he answered \"probably 7:25 or so\", then he took his phone and saw it was 7:37 and rushed off to the bathroom, slamming the door.\n\nAs he was putting his clothes on, he was arguing \"It's an a-hole move of yours to not tell me the time earlier, because of that i'm going to be late and will leave without even brushing my teeth!\".\n\nI told him that I didn't mean to make him pissed off, but that being on time for HIS work isn't MY responsibility, to which he said \"if you are awake and capable of helping out, but you decide not to, then you are an a-hole\".\r  \n\r  \nI get that we are a couple and should help each other, and he's the one paying for all the food and half the bills, so the last thing I want is for him to lose his job because of tardiness.\n\nI was not troubled about being an a-hole until the moment he retaliated back at me in a pretty nasty way: before leaving for work in a rush, he blew his nose on my favorite towel (leaving boogers on it) and said \"you have that white towel on the bathroom to make it look pretty, right?\".\n\nHe's in a general a very good partner, so I was appalled that he would retaliate like that, which made me rethink if I should just keep waking him up if he sleeps in, as I'm already awake and I'm capable of doing it.", "created_utc": 1690290698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15985o4/aita_for_not_waking_up_my_boyfriend_for_work_in/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is an adult and is capable of getting out of bed on time. I would tell him if he ever retaliates in such a disgusting manner again that he will be packing his bags and leaving. That is not acceptable behaviour under any circumstances. He is punishing you for his inability to get himself up on time. This type of abusive behaviour will escalate.\n\nedited to add, he is teaching you that you will be very sorry if you don't do what he wants.", "NTA\n\nHe's snapping at you and blaming you for his childish behavior.  You didn't sign up to be his mommy.  When you alarm goes off, you get up.  You don't put the burden of waking you up on your partner.  BF is an AH.", "Is he 35 or 12? Cause he sounds like a child. I'd just leave him sleeping until he wakes up, if he wants to get fired that's his choice. There's morning I fucking hate my alarm but get my ass out of bed anyway because I'm an adult and I have to work.", "NTA - Your BF is being an AH. He is an adult and he is responsible for getting himself out of bed in time to get to work. It is not your job to wake him up. That is what alarms are for. What if you decide to sleep in one morning? What if you are awake, but busy with your own job and not paying attention to the time? Is he just going to be late? Will it be your fault for not being awake to wake him up? \n\nIf he had accidently forgotten to set an alarm and you noticed and didn't wake him up - that would be an AH move. But he seems to have unilaterally decided that making sure he gets up on time is now your responsibility and he doesn't have to worry about hitting snooze on his alarms or keeping an eye on the clock in the morning. \n\nYes, couples should help each other - but that does not mean that he can just decide that you are responsible for something without your agreement and then get pissy when you don't do it.\n\nAnd him using your nice towel as a snot rag in \"retaliation\" is beyond petty and a pretty serious red flag.", "NTA. He's looking for a mommy, not a partner. The petty retaliatory behavior with the towel is a major red flag. He just disrespected you in a major way.", "Nta.  Break up with him. AYou're not his mom and he's not a 5 year old. So many red flags. I'd be worried about how he will retaliate in the future when you won't/can't do what he wants.", "NTA. While helping each other in a relationship is important, it's not your responsibility to ensure he wakes up on time for work. You have tried to help in the past, and he has reacted negatively when you woke him up earlier. \n\nHis retaliation by being rude and disrespectful is not acceptable and shows a lack of maturity in handling conflicts. \n\nHe should take responsibility for his own punctuality and not take his frustrations out on you.", "NTA.  How did he get to work before he moved in with you? He can do that now. You're not his mommy.", "NTA. You're his partner, not his mother. If it happened on occasion, I'd be fine with a gentle poke and telling him the time. But it sounds like this happens all the time and he genuinely thinks it's your job to wake him up if he's sleeping in too late. His response was also super childish and petty.\n\nI'd have a calm conversation with him about this and let him know you won't be responsible for him getting up on time. Also, pay attention to his reactions to irritations in the future because if he makes a habit of \"retaliating\" when he gets upset, I'd be reconsidering my relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s 35. As in he has been an adult for more than a decade. He should be able to get up on his own. And blowing his nose on your towel just to be petty, again he is 35, not 5! You should not change your behaviour because of his retaliation! He should not retaliate like a child! You two need to have a proper conversation about this, because this can\u2019t go on.", "I am amazed at people who point some horrible red flags in their partners and then say but in general they\u2019re good. Nobody is perfect, but no good person is lazy, entitled, and vindictive. Gather his stuff and change the locks. He moved in with you and put the burden on you . Please don\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t contribute to the household chores because \u201cit\u2019s an engineering job\u201d and he\u2019s so tired. Please please don\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t contribute financially. NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not his mommy and he\u2019s not an 8 year old going to school. It\u2019s not your duty to make him get up and get ready for work. He\u2019s an adult who should be taking care of his schedule. I\u2019d suggest sleeping in separate rooms if his alarm waking you up is a problem for you.", "NTA he's a grown up. Do grown up things", "NTA. Being on time for work or anything else is a personal responsibility. It\u2019s time to sit him down and tell him that you will no longer notify him of the time and if he oversleeps it\u2019s his responsibility to deal with the consequences. There\u2019s absolutely no reason why he cannot set an alarm and get out of bed on time. I would also tell him if he ever does anything as petty and disgusting as blowing his nose on your towels again he can start looking for his own place to live.  He is an AH for expecting you to get him out of bed and for such childish behavior.", "NTA\n\nWouldn't it be great if there was a device that could remind us its time to get up.... Like a clock or a phone.  Then you can be self-reliant.  Oh he has this!!!!!  Instead he goes.... I know I need to get up, I set an alarm and hit snooze and then do it again BUT it's your fault for not waking up!!!!!  Nope!!  You are not his insurance policy against self inflicted stupidity/laziness.  It's like when someone says remind me to do something important, that you have NO RESPONSIBILTY to do, and then they blame you if they miss their deadlines.\n\nHis reprisal was soooo low class and disgusting as well.  He needs to go to sleep earlier, or get some sleep therapy if he is unable to wake up when he needs to.  (Best practice,.... Don't use snooze, just shower.", "NTA, he is a grown man who doesn't need mommy to wake him up.", "NTA. It' s quite worrying that his first thought was to retaliate. Especially in a way that I'm pretty sure is not appropriate for a 35yo man...", "NTA  I agree that blowing snot on your pretty towel is a red flag. I had an ex like this. He stole my favorite shoes and threw them out of a car window. He went to retrieve them only after I called his mom and told on him lol. You might need to call your boyfriend\u2019s mom. He seems like he\u2019s still at that level", "NTA. Your boyfriend is though. He wants to sleep in and not be on time, which is his fault. If he wants to turn to pettiness, tell him living together isn\u2019t working out and you want to live separately. Punishing you for his tardiness and inability to manage his time is not your fault.", "NTA.  He's a grown man, even if his actions would seem to indicate otherwise.  If he can't get up to his alarm, then he should ask you to wake him.  And he should ask nicely.", "ESH. He for obvious reasons. You for, yes, not waking him up sooner. Many here are talking about how you're not his parent and that's true. But in a relationship, you communicate and compromise. Sit him down and ask him what exactly it is he wants you to do and at what time. Then you can decide if that's something you're willing to do. 'Okay, so you want me to wake you up if you're not in the bathroom by 0730. If I'm awake, I can do that. But I'm not going to set alarms to make sure I'm awake at that time.' Or whatever you both decide. But sit down and talk about and decide what you both want to do. Or not.", "ESH. His retaliation was childish and repulsive but as a partner you should care and keep your SO from tripping as much as possible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he's that bad at turning off his alarm then he needs to set several alarms, get one that shakes the bed, get one that makes him solve a math problem, etc. Y'know, what an adult would do.", "He wants a mommy as a girlfriend and it won't stop at expecting u to wake him up on time. Soon he'll start expecting you to make his lunches, take out his work clothes the night before etc etc. \n\nYou need to have a conversation with him about how you're not going to wake him up or mother him in any way shape or form, if he still expects you to do this then idk I'd dump him. He's 35yo and still acts 12, he needs to grow up and respect you as a partner not his mom.", "NTA - couple things, first and foremost it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure he wakes up in the morning on time. He\u2019s an adult he can figure it out. Second, blowing his nose on your towel? That\u2019s just petty and extremely immature. Based off the little information provided I\u2019m gonna assume you can do better.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s an adult. He\u2019s responsible for getting up on time. You\u2019re not his alarm clock or his mother, and the fact that he gave you attitude when you tried to help before? No. \n\nAnd blowing is nose on your towel? Yeah, I would definitely rethink my living situation.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is a freaking jerk.  It's his job.  You're not his mother & you're not responsible for waking him up.  His first alarm goes off at 7, he s/b getting up on his first alarm.  He is an adult acting like a spoiled child.  And him blowing his nose in your towel is disgusting.  I wouldn't let him get away with that.  This man owes you an apology for blowing up at you like he did.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give in. In fact, really consider if you want this in your life.  You can get a man with every good quality that he has, plus he will get up on his own and not feel the need to destroy what you love.   \n\nSeriously. He can set 30 alarms if that is what it takes to get up, the last one being a civil defense tone, but instead he sets 2 and then plays victim because his servant doesn\u2019t cover for him. His victim energy is going to show up in other places too.  Start paying attention to his other excuses for why things don\u2019t go his way.", "NTA. Move out so him waking up on time is no longer your problem.", "NTA has he thought of setting his first alarm earlier instead of always leaving it all till the last minute my come back would have been you have an alarm maybe stop snoozing it and relying on me to get you up and just get up\n\nAnd blowing his nose on a towel because he's too lazy to get up himself is pathetic honestly", "NTA He needs a mom not a girlfriend. Also, don't justify what he did because he is in general a good partner. A good partner would not do what he did. That was mean, deliberate and meant to disrespect you. Rethink this relationship. Find a partner who respects you and is not an immature brat who needs a mommy to wake him up for work. One who does not \"retaliate\" because of their short comings. This is all on him. He is a 35 yo man, not a child. Time to move on.", "NTA. As an occasional occurrence, yes, you should wake him, but not every day. That\u2019s just replacing his alarm clocks with you. \n\nThe snot on the towel is disgusting! He needs to apologise and clean it or go, because wrecking your stuff because he\u2019s angry is not okay.", "NTA, when did you give birth to him? Congratulations on your child!", "NTA - you are not his mother.

And then has the audacity to yell at you that you are not acting like his mom? And then smearing his boogers on your nice towel like an angry 14yo? 35 you said? Are you sure? \n\nI'll be honest with you. I would have lost all sexual attraction to this guy the first  time he demanded i have to play mommy and wake him up after he ignored his alarms. I'm not interested in dating oedipus and i definitly do NOT want to have sex with a 14yo teen.", "NTA. This dude has been clearly catered to by his mother who would have taken the snot-on-towel move.

This wasn't a once off thing, he purposefully decided to not pay attention to the clock anymore and just expects his SO to wake him up without asking her to agree to doing this and feels entitled to her time. He wants a mommy for a gf and I sincerely hope OP dumps him because this behaviour only gets worse with time", "Yea, honestly me too, but I see so many people on here jumping to break up immediately and I wanted to put it nicely, haha", "Understandable! I always expect push back when I am on team \"unacceptable, throw the whole person out\", but I only ever say it in cases where I'm passionately sure.
