I have been the one to wake him up several times when I notice he's sleeping in. He has his first alarm at 7, then one at 7:10, he has to leave at 7:45 max if he wants to get to his workplace by 8am.\r  \n\r  \nI work from home, I'm a freelancer, so I have no need to wake up that early. On the times I realized he hasn't moved from bed and it's past 7:30, he would get really mad when I woke him up, yelling \"Why didn't you wake me up sooner???\".\r  \n\r  \nToday I woke up at 7am by his alarm clock, as we sleep together. He woke up, turned it off, and went back to sleep like he usually does until the 7:10 alarm. Then he turned off the 7:10 alarm and went back to sleep again.\n\nI wasn't really paying attention to the time, but I was using my phone as some clients were texting me already. I kept looking at my boyfriend from time to time, and he would open his eyes at me, smile, and nod, then close his eyes again. \r  \n\r  \nHere's where I might be the a-hole... I checked the time and it was already 7:37. I look at him calmly, he smiles, and I ask \"do you know what time is it?\", to which he answered \"probably 7:25 or so\", then he took his phone and saw it was 7:37 and rushed off to the bathroom, slamming the door.\n\nAs he was putting his clothes on, he was arguing \"It's an a-hole move of yours to not tell me the time earlier, because of that i'm going to be late and will leave without even brushing my teeth!\".\n\nI told him that I didn't mean to make him pissed off, but that being on time for HIS work isn't MY responsibility, to which he said \"if you are awake and capable of helping out, but you decide not to, then you are an a-hole\".\r  \n\r  \nI get that we are a couple and should help each other, and he's the one paying for all the food and half the bills, so the last thing I want is for him to lose his job because of tardiness.\n\nI was not troubled about being an a-hole until the moment he retaliated back at me in a pretty nasty way: before leaving for work in a rush, he blew his nose on my favorite towel (leaving boogers on it) and said \"you have that white towel on the bathroom to make it look pretty, right?\".\n\nHe's in a general a very good partner, so I was appalled that he would retaliate like that, which made me rethink if I should just keep waking him up if he sleeps in, as I'm already awake and I'm capable of doing it.", "created_utc": 1690290698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15985o4/aita_for_not_waking_up_my_boyfriend_for_work_in/", "score": 5645, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is an adult and is capable of getting out of bed on time. I would tell him if he ever retaliates in such a disgusting manner again that he will be packing his bags and leaving. That is not acceptable behaviour under any circumstances. He is punishing you for his inability to get himself up on time. This type of abusive behaviour will escalate.\n\nedited to add, he is teaching you that you will be very sorry if you don't do what he wants.", "NTA\n\nHe's snapping at you and blaming you for his childish behavior.  You didn't sign up to be his mommy.  When you alarm goes off, you get up.  You don't put the burden of waking you up on your partner.  BF is an AH.", "Is he 35 or 12? Cause he sounds like a child. I'd just leave him sleeping until he wakes up, if he wants to get fired that's his choice. There's morning I fucking hate my alarm but get my ass out of bed anyway because I'm an adult and I have to work.", "NTA - Your BF is being an AH. He is an adult and he is responsible for getting himself out of bed in time to get to work. It is not your job to wake him up. That is what alarms are for. What if you decide to sleep in one morning? What if you are awake, but busy with your own job and not paying attention to the time? Is he just going to be late? Will it be your fault for not being awake to wake him up? \n\nIf he had accidently forgotten to set an alarm and you noticed and didn't wake him up - that would be an AH move. But he seems to have unilaterally decided that making sure he gets up on time is now your responsibility and he doesn't have to worry about hitting snooze on his alarms or keeping an eye on the clock in the morning. \n\nYes, couples should help each other - but that does not mean that he can just decide that you are responsible for something without your agreement and then get pissy when you don't do it.\n\nAnd him using your nice towel as a snot rag in \"retaliation\" is beyond petty and a pretty serious red flag.", "NTA. He's looking for a mommy, not a partner. The petty retaliatory behavior with the towel is a major red flag. He just disrespected you in a major way.", "Nta.  Break up with him. AYou're not his mom and he's not a 5 year old. So many red flags. I'd be worried about how he will retaliate in the future when you won't/can't do what he wants.", "NTA. While helping each other in a relationship is important, it's not your responsibility to ensure he wakes up on time for work. You have tried to help in the past, and he has reacted negatively when you woke him up earlier. \n\nHis retaliation by being rude and disrespectful is not acceptable and shows a lack of maturity in handling conflicts. \n\nHe should take responsibility for his own punctuality and not take his frustrations out on you.", "NTA.  How did he get to work before he moved in with you? He can do that now. You're not his mommy.", "NTA. You're his partner, not his mother. If it happened on occasion, I'd be fine with a gentle poke and telling him the time. But it sounds like this happens all the time and he genuinely thinks it's your job to wake him up if he's sleeping in too late. His response was also super childish and petty.\n\nI'd have a calm conversation with him about this and let him know you won't be responsible for him getting up on time. Also, pay attention to his reactions to irritations in the future because if he makes a habit of \"retaliating\" when he gets upset, I'd be reconsidering my relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s 35. As in he has been an adult for more than a decade. He should be able to get up on his own. And blowing his nose on your towel just to be petty, again he is 35, not 5! You should not change your behaviour because of his retaliation! He should not retaliate like a child! You two need to have a proper conversation about this, because this can\u2019t go on.", "I am amazed at people who point some horrible red flags in their partners and then say but in general they\u2019re good.

Please don\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t contribute to the household chores because \u201cit\u2019s an engineering job\u201d and he\u2019s so tired. Please please don\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t contribute financially. NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not his mommy and he\u2019s not an 8 year old going to school. It\u2019s not your duty to make him get up and get ready for work. He\u2019s an adult who should be taking care of his schedule. I\u2019d suggest sleeping in separate rooms if his alarm waking you up is a problem for you.", "NTA he's a grown up. Do grown up things", "NTA. Being on time for work or anything else is a personal responsibility. It\u2019s time to sit him down and tell him that you will no longer notify him of the time and if he oversleeps it\u2019s his responsibility to deal with the consequences. There\u2019s absolutely no reason why he cannot set an alarm and get out of bed on time. I would also tell him if he ever does anything as petty and disgusting as blowing his nose on your towels again he can start looking for his own place to live.  He is an AH for expecting you to get him out of bed and for such childish behavior.", "NTA\n\nWouldn't it be great if there was a device that could remind us its time to get up.... Like a clock or a phone.  Then you can be self-reliant.  Oh he has this!!!!!  Instead he goes.... I know I need to get up, I set an alarm and hit snooze and then do it again BUT it's your fault for not waking up!!!!!  Nope!!  You are not his insurance policy against self inflicted stupidity/laziness.  It's like when someone says remind me to do something important, that you have NO RESPONSIBILTY to do, and then they blame you if they miss their deadlines.\n\nHis reprisal was soooo low class and disgusting as well.  He needs to go to sleep earlier, or get some sleep therapy if he is unable to wake up when he needs to.  (Best practice,.... Don't use snooze, just shower.", "NTA, he is a grown man who doesn't need mommy to wake him up.", "NTA. It' s quite worrying that his first thought was to retaliate. Especially in a way that I'm pretty sure is not appropriate for a 35yo man...", "NTA  I agree that blowing snot on your pretty towel is a red flag. I had an ex like this. He stole my favorite shoes and threw them out of a car window. He went to retrieve them only after I called his mom and told on him lol. You might need to call your boyfriend\u2019s mom. He seems like he\u2019s still at that level", "NTA. Your boyfriend is though. He wants to sleep in and not be on time, which is his fault. If he wants to turn to pettiness, tell him living together isn\u2019t working out and you want to live separately. Punishing you for his tardiness and inability to manage his time is not your fault.", "NTA.  He's a grown man, even if his actions would seem to indicate otherwise.  If he can't get up to his alarm, then he should ask you to wake him.  And he should ask nicely.", "ESH. He for obvious reasons. You for, yes, not waking him up sooner. Many here are talking about how you're not his parent and that's true. But in a relationship, you communicate and compromise. Sit him down and ask him what exactly it is he wants you to do and at what time. Then you can decide if that's something you're willing to do. 'Okay, so you want me to wake you up if you're not in the bathroom by 0730. If I'm awake, I can do that. But I'm not going to set alarms to make sure I'm awake at that time.' Or whatever you both decide. But sit down and talk about and decide what you both want to do. Or not.", "ESH.

Maybe you both need to have a hard conversation about your wants and needs and his wants and needs and how you both can compromise. This might make you closer even though right now it sucks. So just work on growing and learning from this experience for the future.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT your fault though.  He sucks ass for telling you that.  You know how he should\u2019ve approached you? He should\u2019ve said \u201cnext time can you try to wake me up at such and such time if you notice?\u201d And then just go on about his day and go to work.

I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019ve slept through the first couple alarms like not even registered in my head and it\u2019s playing for 10 minutes then it\u2019ll switch to the next alarm and it\u2019ll click I need to wake up.", "I got the ice cubes!

Then it\u2019ll be your relationships with friends and family. It will keep escalating until he breaks YOU, mentally, emotionally, and probably physically. This is not normal behavior in ANY circumstance, and his behavior will only get worse from here on out. You deserve so much better.", "NTA!

I gave up wondering what time he wanted to wake up about 30 years ago. Being on time was never hubbies thing. I hope you can get through this with BF. He is responcible for his own wake time, not you.", "NTA. Holy. Shit. The stuff before was childish and stupid but actively targeting something you love to punish you?

It absolutely floors me how many adults(?) are like \"He's not a kid, you don't have to wake him up!111! YOU ARENT HIS MOMMMMM\" like, grow the fuck up.   Everyone has off days. Everyone has late nights. Everyone has moments where their alarm doesn't get through the fog in their head.    \n\n\nYou should, 100%, absolutely pay attention to that sort of thing.  You should know when your partner needs to head out the door. You should know when things aren't going as normal.  You should have no problem acting, especially when him getting to work benefits everything.  You already readily admit that he pays for a disproportionate amount of household costs.  \n\n\nIt just floors me someone can be like \"I benefit from you going through this meatgrinder but I can't be assed to wake you up or pay attention to the time.\"  \n\n\nAt the same time...? His reaction? Not great.  Just like there's so many crazy people going \"YOU SHOULDNT BE EXPECTED TO HELP YOUR PARTNER!1\", there's a lot claiming this is horrific abuse and some unforgiveable sin.  \n\n\nIt was childish and petty, sure. But created a non-destructive inconvenience.  They're fucking towels and they can be washed.  It's right up there with a pissed SO not ironing clothes and letting their partner deal with wrinkled outfits.  \n\n\nStupid, super petty, not a huge deal.  \n\n\nHonestly you both sound too immature to live together.", "What an AH. This is so disgusting. Leave.", "Another sane person.", "Nice casual sexism.", "Plus his whole \"if you're up and capable of helping, you should\" is BS. She was WORKING, texting with clients.

She never got up for the first one. It drove my absolutely bonkers. One day she didn\u2019t get up for her alarm. I ended up getting up for my class later. I was drying my hair in our room ( a bit of an asshole move). She asked me how I could be so rude. I told her she sets ten alarms every day so how in the hell should I know when she\u2019s supposed to actually be up or not. I was probably the asshole in that particular situation but whatever.", "Tell him to fuck off with the multiple alarms and just set one at 7:45 and he's only allowed 1 snooze. Honestly, that is torture for himself, too. Who wants to be woken up constantly for an hour before you actually need to get up? \n\nWhenever I wake up before my alarm and check the time. If I still have an hour before my alarm I'm trying to sleep a bit more. If I got 5 minutes before, I'm like \"fuck!\".\n\nI got my alarm set for 4:30 am because I have 1 hour drive to work and start at 6:30 am. I snooze until 4:40-4:45, then I gotta get up.

He took care of his children. He didn't \"babysit.\"", "I know, how awesome is this?! I always used to set my alarm and place the clock across the room on my bureau and have told otehr to do the same but this, this is genius!  I just put my great-niece's marbles in the freezer.

Next time that I am \"it\", i plan to go place the frozen marbles, all 20 of them, on the sofa bed where he is sleeping and wheel away. I hated having to wheel in and out of the living room multiple times to wake him because he did not get up the first time. Especially after offering him the use of a phone to use the alarm feature and an old-fashioned alarm clock. He says he has an \"aversion\".

There is a big difference between taking the time to understand each other's various needs and throwing a temper tantrum when your partner doesn't make an accommodation that you haven't asked for.  I certainly agree that if OP and their boyfriend had discussed it prior, and set a time he needs to be out of bed by, AND that that is something they are both willing to do, it could be part of a healthy relationship.
