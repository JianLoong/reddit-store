My last relationship was mentally and emotionally abusive to the point I needed therapy for PTSD. Due to some of the comments he made, I had some suspicions but I have chalked it up to my pride being hurt. Well, during lockdown I checked out some of the people I've lost contact with over the years and turns out he's now out an out and proud BI. I'm having mixed feelings about it to be honest. I'm feeling incredibly sad that in this day and age, in a Western country, he was still confused and scared about his sexuality. I'm happy that he has finally worked it out. But he has hurt me to the point of panic attacks and suicidal thoughts for what? To be able to fit in a hetero society? He has humiliated, degraded and dehumanised me. He set me up for stalking and harassment by some of his extremely xenophobic friends. (I'm 100% sure they didn't know either, one of the girls in question had a serious obsession with him.) By the time we broke things off (mercifully, it was a fairly short relationship) I wasn't even feeling human anymore. And he just gets to walk away from it saying \"sorry. I'm bi.\"? Was he even attracted to me? Did he have to force himself to have sex with me? (He initiated 9 times out of 10) Did he find me even remotely attractive? Or was I just a decoy for him to be able to appear \"normal\"?Your sister might be struggling with similar feelings. Maybe it would be worth checking on her and seeing how she actually feels about it all.", "NTA -Your intent was in no way to hurt your sister. But, alot of men who are gay pornstars identify as straight and carry heterosexual lives outside of \"work\", they do it because the money is good.

Your friend is soft.", "YTA for several reasons. You\u2019ve assumed he\u2019s gay, but does HE say he is? Bisexuality and pansexuality exist.

You assumed that because he does gay porn it means he's gay, even though he could be bi, pan, straight, or anything else. You assumed that he realized he wasn't attracted to her because he's gay, even though he could have just lost the initial attraction he had like happens in a lot of relationships. You assumed that your sister didn't have any residual animosity towards him (she did) and would want to know this info (she didn't).
