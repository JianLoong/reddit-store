Though to be honest I\u2019m not sure I would wish your family on any of them.", "NTA. -  why would you even ask that?

YOU found her. Dogs are life long commitments and shouldn\u2019t be treated like this. This isn\u2019t an old phone or laptop- this is a beautiful dog who deserves a loving owner like you.", "NTA. Your parents are the assholes on this.", "Sounds like it\u2019s your dog, not his. Glad you got out. NTA", "Wow you are way NTA. I am sorry you have parents like that. I have no idea where they get off saying that it is his dog", "Oh hell no you are NTA. How dare they? Go NC with all of them.

She went to them, told them that their dog was in her yard and hurt bad. They didn\u2019t care. My grandmother was a softy, so she took the dog to the vet. She then nursed it back to health. Once the dog was healed from surgery, who comes knocking? The people down the street. They wanted the dog. She told them they would have to pay her back for the vet bills. They refused. She told them if they wouldn\u2019t pay her back she wasn\u2019t giving the dog back. They attempted to make an issue of it, but my grandmother was able to show the vet bills for her dog. That was a good dog that lived to a ripe old age.", "NTA. Set boundaries. You rescued, paid for, and trained the pup. Sounds an awful lot like its yours.", "NTA- It's your dog. No one else's. You paid for everything regarding her.\n\nYour brother is a brat and your parents are enabling said brat. Sorry you have parents like this.\n\nGet anything you can done to prevent the dog from getting stolen. I saw you already got her microchipped. That's good. Maybe invest in a security camera or two. Talk to whoever the apartment management is and make sure to let them know to not let anyone, including family, into your residence. Block your parents too.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Do not tell them, nor any relatives, nor family friends where you live as it could get back to them and they would definitely steal the dog.

Don't divulge your address and definitely keep the dog far away from them.

Hope it works out for you.", "NTA - You are a total rockstar for the way you just up and did what it took to take care of your dog!  And I'm stunned that your parents are more concerned about stealing your dog for your brother than the fact that their 19 yr old daughter felt it was necessary to flee their home without warning or notice.  That's just garbage IMO.", "NTA but I sure am curious if this is the first instance of your parents being nutty. If you can I would be sure to microchip and license the dog in your name at your new address  so there is a paper trail in case they try to take this further.", "NTA, I read one of your comments about your mother saying you would only be someone's wife and nothing else.

Definitely call the non emergency line to get it on file and id also ask them what else you can do to protect yourself and the dog in the event they come and steal the dog back , like what paper work you need and how to register the dog as yours etc. \n\nI\u2019d also maybe call a lawyer or a couple lawyers as well and ask them the same questions so you can get a couple different answers. \n\nThen lastly make sure you give the dog a big old hug, High five and a puppychino from me for being such a good doggo to you !", "Excellent point!", "Also - shouting at your dog is a big no no.", "You'd think so, but one of the big things I've learned from the pandemic is how much people value their own convenience over the comfort, safety, and well-being of others.

Well done!\n\nYou are absolutely NTA, btw. Mute their messages and live your best life with your furry best friend.", "NTA... Im Not sure why your parents are so unreasonable. I hope there are records at the vet that you brought the dog in and paid. Is there other areas where this unreasonableness show up in them? Do they consider the dog theirs because they buy the pet food?\n\nEDIT... if you moved out without discussion and their calls to you were about the dog, this indicates your parents are generally AHs. I'm sorry. Congrats on your new apartment", "I would even go as far as contacting police and say they might try to steal your dog. I would not tell your parents where you live. NTA obviously.

This is a very lucky dog and I\u2019m sure she loves you absolutely. I\u2019m happy you and Lia have this bond. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry your parents don\u2019t appreciate you. I think they want the dog so your brother will become more like you. They don\u2019t know about love. You have love and give love but it\u2019s a foreign language to them. I\u2019m not your mom but I\u2019m proud of you keeping it together and saving your money and moving out. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re grieving at some level as you\u2019ve lost your family in a physical way and never had normal, healthy people love you and raise you in a happy family.

My vet requires not only permission from the owner but written permission with a signature. I would be a little nervous my parents might try something like that (or forging a letter and your signature) so notifying the vet and groomer that you are the only one allowed to pick up your dog may be a good idea. Make sure you tell them both in person and by email (keep those emails on file just in case) and insist that they put it your dog\u2019s file.\n\nEdited to say this too: if you haven\u2019t already, it might be a good idea to make friends with the vet\u2019s office and the front staff. Not only are they working your dog but they also see and hear everything.

If they do steal him and you have ownership docs in place, you can and should press charges.\n\nDogs are not inanimate objects to be passed down like an heirloom. Thank you for protecting him.", "WTF is wrong with your parents? Honestly, it might be a good idea to go low/no contact at least for a while, and don't let them find out where you live.

They bought him another car and made me pay the difference in insurance prices. \n\n\u2014he has never done a chore in his life unless you count the one week in summer camp back when he was eleven. It was a coed camp and I was a camp counselor then. Every single chore rotation he had there would be complaints about him being brainless. \n\n-me on the other hand I\u2019ve been doing chores since I was young. But if I wanted to touch a power tool I was told it was man\u2019s work. \n\n-he gets his birthday celebrated every year. My last birthday acknowledgment from them was when I was 9. \n\n-this last Christmas he got two different game systems, a new laptop, a tv, and gift cards.

Hey, that's still a pretty big accomplishment! \n\nBorder Collies are bred to be constantly thinking and working so they can guard large flocks of sheep in the English countryside. They're actually the smartest breed of dogs out there! \n\nBut they are notorious for turning destructive if you don't give them a job or a puzzle to do at all times.

Treating dogs that really gets my goat. \n\nI volunteer with my local animal rescue organization and right now we have this absolute sweetheart of a dog who was surrendered by owners who were assholes like OP's brother. The dog is so sweet and loving and just has an all around wonderful temperament, but he's been adopted and returned twice already because he keeps pooping in his kennel. It's really sad because it's obvious his original owners neglected him and yelled at him when he alerted them he needed to go out, so now he thinks he's *supposed* to go inside. He won't poop when he's out in the play yard and will hold it until he gets back to his kennel. Finding a home with people who are willing to put up with cleaning up dog poop every day for as long as it takes to retrain him is unfortunately very hard, and trying to retrain him in the shelter environment is difficult as well just because of how understaffed they are, although he's making some progress, just slowly.", "NTA and update the info for the microchip to your new address if you haven't already done it.", "And by all that is Holy don't let them know where you live.", "If they send anything over text, save it.
