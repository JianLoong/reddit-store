You trained her and spent money on her. Don't respond to your parents or your brother about your dog. It doesn't pertain to them at all!! Also, if you don't have her microchipped, definitely do that and put your name and details.", "NTA. If he wants a dog so badly there are thousands in shelters that need homes. Though to be honest I\u2019m not sure I would wish your family on any of them.", "NTA. -  why would you even ask that?  Do you have receipts for all the vet bills you have paid and a copy of the papers at the vet saying how you found the dog?  This will be proof of ownership.  Are dogs licensed where you live?  If so and she\u2019s not licensed\nDo so yesterday!  Tell your parents it\u2019s your dog and you will not allow her to be mistreated and not to contact you again until they come to their senses. \n\nThey sound like raving assholes. If they keep harassing you, block them.\nMake sure your landlord or whoever knows to never allow anyone into your apt.  I figure you should just cover all bases.", "NTA. This is YOUR dog. YOU found her. Dogs are life long commitments and shouldn\u2019t be treated like this. This isn\u2019t an old phone or laptop- this is a beautiful dog who deserves a loving owner like you.", "NTA. Your parents are the assholes on this.", "Sounds like it\u2019s your dog, not his. Glad you got out. NTA", "Wow you are way NTA. I am sorry you have parents like that. I have no idea where they get off saying that it is his dog", "Oh hell no you are NTA. How dare they? Go NC with all of them. You are the epitome of a responsible pet owner and I'm glad to read you have her microchipped. I would have a few choice words and probably some hands they could catch if they even tried that with MY dog.", "NTA. Make sure you have the vet records that prove you\u2019ve taken care of her. If they locate you they\u2019ll try to steal her.\n\nMy grandmother adopted an injured dog. We knew it belonged to the people down the street. She went to them, told them that their dog was in her yard and hurt bad. They didn\u2019t care. My grandmother was a softy, so she took the dog to the vet. She then nursed it back to health. Once the dog was healed from surgery, who comes knocking? The people down the street. They wanted the dog. She told them they would have to pay her back for the vet bills. They refused. She told them if they wouldn\u2019t pay her back she wasn\u2019t giving the dog back. They attempted to make an issue of it, but my grandmother was able to show the vet bills for her dog. That was a good dog that lived to a ripe old age.", "NTA. Set boundaries. You rescued, paid for, and trained the pup. Sounds an awful lot like its yours.", "NTA- It's your dog. No one else's. You paid for everything regarding her.\n\nYour brother is a brat and your parents are enabling said brat. Sorry you have parents like this.\n\nGet anything you can done to prevent the dog from getting stolen. I saw you already got her microchipped. That's good. Maybe invest in a security camera or two. Talk to whoever the apartment management is and make sure to let them know to not let anyone, including family, into your residence. Block your parents too.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Do not tell them, nor any relatives, nor family friends where you live as it could get back to them and they would definitely steal the dog. Brother sounds like he would hit and neglect the poor pup.\n      Frankly I wouldn't even trust your brother with a fucking cactus, since he would somehow manage to kill it, then yell at it for not growing properly.", "NTA. Don't divulge your address and definitely keep the dog far away from them. Warn your landlord that your family shouldn't be allowed access into the apartment; especially under the pretense of tanking care of the pet during your absence.", ">then my parents came and yelled at me saying that he is allowed to discipline his dog.\n\nYelling at a dog because it asked to go outside, and asked in the way that she was taught, is terrible.

I\u2019m also sorry your parents don\u2019t respect you enough. You did the right thing. Hope it works out for you.", "NTA - You are a total rockstar for the way you just up and did what it took to take care of your dog!  And I'm stunned that your parents are more concerned about stealing your dog for your brother than the fact that their 19 yr old daughter felt it was necessary to flee their home without warning or notice.  That's just garbage IMO.", "NTA but I sure am curious if this is the first instance of your parents being nutty. If you can I would be sure to microchip and license the dog in your name at your new address  so there is a paper trail in case they try to take this further.", "NTA, I read one of your comments about your mother saying you would only be someone's wife and nothing else. Wanting to give your dog to your brother also sounds like it has misogynistic backbone since you're a girl and he's a boy.

Hopefully your brother doesn't get ruined by these people. If you can try to find and save any records of payment for the vet bills in case they do a court thing or steal the dog. I'd suggest not telling them where you live or anyone who would tell them. Good luck.", "NTA sounds like your dog to me.", "NTA.", "NTA. Not their dog.", "100% NTA.

You've kept up with her unending energy.\n\nIn a way, it sounds like Lia saved you too. Your family does not sound healthy, but it wasn't until Lia's well-being was at stake that you left.

They are teaching their son some horrible lessons. He's going to be a right asshole when he grows up. Border collies and collie xs are really easy to train. All they have to do is find a specialised rescue for collies. Not that I would wish my favourite breed on those horrible people. \n\nOp, if you see this, can we have a pet tax please?
