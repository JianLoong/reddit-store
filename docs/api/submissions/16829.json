May be the reason she feels ok spending the money on her. Please don't give her ultimatums about friend. Perhaps just put the questions out there that she needs to examine her friendship.

And then lying to cover it because she knows you wouldn't agree?   Ouch.\n\nYou two need to sort out your money situation and sort out how extremely disrespectful/relationship killing this type of behavior is.  Lying and money issues are two of the biggest causes of divorce.  This is multiple significant breaches of trust, and if she doesn't see it, like truly hang her head, OMG what did I do, see it, your relationship is going to be in trouble.\n\nAnother good question is why is this accepting this money?  If I was short money I would be window shopping instead of buying, suggesting we spent time on a beach or in a forest instead of going to shows, and eating a burger when we went to a steak house, not running up 4 figure tabs that I expected my friend and their partner to pay.  I couldn't look myself in the mirror if I sponged off others like that.  She might think she and her friend have a really deep bond, but if her friend can't accept her saying no, sorry, I can't buy you all this stuff, then the bond isn't really that deep.\n\nP.S.

As a last resort, if nothing works out, divorce.", "NTA. Sounds like she just took advantage and treated you like an ATM that week, and spending $2000 in a couple days is absurd.

She should have just been upfront with you from the start. It's the lying that's the issue imo. Something to definitely discuss in the future.

You're spoiling HER, not her and a plus one. In the future, I'd give her a set budget per month/per trip if you want to keep being generous. A set amount of money you deposit, and then she needs to budget it to make it last. Maybe that will teach her to actually appreciate instead of taking advantage.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that the best friend invited her probably knowing that she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford much honestly is a red flag. Like I 100% understand helping a best friend, treating her to a a few drinks or a few meals but thousands of dollars that\u2019s crazy.\n\nThe fact that you transferred money the first time honestly is more then what most people would do anyways", "Assuming the rest of your marriage is good, I recommend counseling to discuss how you manage and communicate regarding finances. The lying seems like a big deal to me. NTA", "NTA, but both your wife and her friend are. Your wife violated your trust by lying to you and misrepresenting how your joint funds are being used, plus is allowing this so-called leach of a friend to take advantage of you.", "NTA and I'm picturing wife's surprised Pikachu face reading these comments and realizing Reddit does not, in fact, agree with her, lol.", "You should start saying ex wife.  I am glad my wife is not stupid enough to play me like this.", "I need a friend like your wife. Lol", "So\u2026 you don\u2019t mind footing the bill until it reaches a certain threshold? INFO - did you set a budget for this trip ahead of time?", "NTA, but I don't think wife is either.   Friend is obviously taking advantage of her and she bought into it hook, line, and sinker.  \n\nIt would be a completely different story if it wasn't friend's idea to go on the trip.    Then I could understand feeling an obligation after possibly pressuring her into a high cost trip she possibly couldn't afford.   But inviting your wife and apparently not planning on paying for anything feels like scheming (otherwise friend should have taken care of lodging or some other type of the actual planning level costs at a minimum).    Your wife obviously really cares about her friend and feels like she isn't a good friend if she doesn't do things like this so they can do them together.  Friend obviously has a favorite person to pay for her trips. \n\nOP, don't take it out too much on wife, I don't think this is a symptom of larger inconsideration of you on her part.   But you both really need to sit down and discuss this \"friend\" and what boundaries need to be established.    Your wife may be afraid \"friend\" will just ask someone else next time and leave her out if suddenly \"friend\" has to actually pay her way if going with wife, but when it comes down to it, someone who is only your friend while you pay for everything was never really your friend at all.", "INFO: Did your wife know she was going to pay for everything for her friend before the trip? Besides the hotel, is there a chance she thought her friend would be paying her share of food etc? \n\n\n\nI think that really determines whether your wife is an AH or not. She might not have been deliberately concealing expenses from you before the trip. She even could have been feeling taken advantage of herself, but just didn\u2019t want to discuss it with her friend there.", "Come on man?? Really? You need reddits help on this one?

Your wife also seems to have an issue with budgeting as she clearly didn't have a plan in terms of budgeting for her vacation. Perhaps that's because she knew you would cover any overages without question? \n\nI don't know if your wife has been using you as an ATM, but at the very least she seems to be a bit immature. Lying to you about paying for her friend, spending money on frivolous things...that sounds like the behavior of someone in their teens, not someone close to 40 years old. Maybe it's time to stop paying for everything for everyone?", "NTA-Your wife's friend is absolutely an entitled leech! 2k in a day and she wants more! I feel guilty when someone buys me lunch and it's not my birthday.", "NTA. The friend, definitely the asshole. Your wife needs better friends that aren't using you both.", "NTA", "NTA. Your wife's friend owes you for what you spent on her trip with your wife. End of discussion. Your wife and her friend are both AHs. The friend for planning a trip she knew she couldn't afford and inviting your wife because she knew your wife would pay. Your wife for not canceling the trip when the friend couldn't provide her half, spending money from the joint account on her friend's shopping spree, and asking for more money twice because she blew through that.", "Waiting for the short part\u2026", "NTA but you need to recalibrate the financial load in your house", "NTA, you were manipulated and used. \n\nCompletely disrespectful by your wife.\n\nEdit spelling.", "Was she paying Mickey Mouse to piggyback them both around Disneyland the whole time?!? They blew through some serious cash. NTA.", "NTA - sounds like they were planning on using you for the money from the beginning", "NTA, wife did not discuss with you before spending large chunks of money from joint account. No spouse should be taken advantage of like that. I would also note that lying or just trying to avoid telling the truth is even worse than the money issue. If you can't trust her with telling you the truth about something like this, then what else do you need to qorry about trusting her with.", "NTA\n\nhow much food they exactly ate or shopping they did that 2k isnt enough for 2 days and they ask more?", "Since your arrangements have been fine until now, it sounds like the problem is this \u201cfriend\u201d. Do you think she would continue to invite your wife places if you weren\u2019t picking up the tab?", "NTA, except maybe you are an asshole to yourself. \n\nHonestly it sounds like your wife has been taking advantage of you for 12 years, except it took her this long to just be that blatant about it. You said you split bills \"65/35\", but it doesn't sound that way at all if you are paying all of the major expenses. Your wife should not be able to use *all* of her money as \"play money\", she should be contributing to the mortgage, bills, and everything else, just proportional to her income. If she only pays for piddly things and uses the rest for personal expenses, she's taking advantage of you. \n\nSo basically it's a \"your money is our money and my money is my money\" type situation. It sounds like your wife needs to be contributing a lot more towards mutual expenses, or start working full time.", "NTA. My husband and I have separate finances. When I go on a trip, he gives me spending money. And by \"spending money\" I mean he gives me like a couple hundred to go out and have a nice time with my friends. Otherwise, we fund our own individual trips. We have one shared account where we put money for joint expenses and vacations.\n\nYour wife has got waaay too comfortable spending your money. Was she buying shoes and handbags for her friend or what? How did she blow through that much money in such a short time?", "NTA - in what world does your wife think lying by omission and financial infidelity is okay?  That would be auto I can't trust you ever again..", "Info: how much money did she start out with and blow that she needed a total of $3500 more for a trip lasting only a few days?\nEdited to add judgement: NTA in any way", "NTA. However your wife has friends like mine, \"Takers\" is what my spouse calls them.", "NTA. \n\nFigure out a more long term financial situation.", "NTA.\n\nUtterly disrespectful of your wife. \n\nThis is why I scoff at people's idea that once in a marriage, it's OUR MONEY. Not your or mine. \n\nFace it. It is still your money, OP. You have the generosity to share it all with your wife. In a marriage, sharing is a must and you go all in, fabulous.\n\nMeanwhile she was being generous too, except at your expense, and then had the audacity to get mad at you.\n\nLike hhhwhat.", "I went to South Africa, on the Safari and see Victoria Falls for under $4000. I was gone for almost 2 weeks.", "NTA, and either your wife is a doormat who literally can\u2019t say no to this friend or she\u2019s been an entitled shit the entire time and this is just the first time she\u2019s done something big enough to register.", "NTA. Your wife and her friend might be really close and have known each other a long time but I\u2019m getting the vibes that dear friend is using y\u2019all for money, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have planned and invited your wife on an expensive vacation and then had YOUR WIFE and by extension YOU pay for ALL of it.", "NTA and she is a very Lucky woman normally these stories have a hint of financial abuse on man\u2019s side but she is abusing your kindness and finances. She needs to apologize and take a real strong look at this friend because I\u2019m sorry no good true friend would feel comfortable basically party off her friends hubby wallet ! Terrible behavior on both their parts. She is lucky you didn\u2019t cut her off sooner", "NTA! Your wife is a big one", "NTA. You\u2019re wife was used. Even when I\u2019m with my partner, I don\u2019t even splurge.", "The golden goose can fight back? You\u2019re not allowed to do that!!\n\nNTA- I look forward to your wife listening to Reddit and not coming up with another strained excuse for why she\u2019s right to be angry.", "NTA", "NTA- time to tell your wife not to pay for the friend any more and stop putting money in the joint account for her to access.", "Legit wild that your wife thought reddit would be on her side", "Nta", "NTA. You guys have problems that Reddit, of all fucking places, can\u2019t help you with. Go to counseling FFS", "\u201ci\u2019ll keep this short\u201d\n\nLong ass post", "I budgeted $4,000 for a trip and came back with $3,000. That was over a week away for a family of 4. (Granted, we visited family who kept paying for things, but not that much.)", "This is coming from a poor person here, but who the fuck can even spend 2000 EXTRA DOLLARS on top of the lodging and food. Not to mention part of the original money was for entire non necessities for the vacation like shopping. 2000 in 3 days is INSANE absolutely insane to spend that much in 3 days even with 2 people.", "Or the wife.", "would keep the joint account dry too", "Even if this \u201cfriend\u201d evaporated [i.e. found a new mark] tomorrow, the underlying issue in their marriage would just keep coming up in years to come. OP and wife should schedule a few sessions with a counselor and a financial advisor to both get to the bottom of why this happened and understand what their mutual goals are and how this kind of thing impacts them or not as a team.", "This one hits the nail on the head. Had she been clear up front about spending all the money from their joint account her friend, OP probably would have disagreed to that arrangement, but instead she lied and didn\u2019t give OP a chance. Definitely a violation of trust. \n\nIt\u2019s actually kind of wild that she would bring this up as something she should be mad about. If I lied to my wife and spent all of our money, you can guarantee I wouldn\u2019t be calling her the ass hole.", "At this point OP is basically the friend's sugar daddy, too.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Ha! I'm not! Sign me up as a friend. Oh and most definitely NTA", "Me too asking for a friend. Tell your wife I\u2019ll even bring the wine on out outing.", "\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f I want to apply for the friend position as well!", "She needs to apologize to OP. Not sure why she keeps bringing it up to him like he did something wrong.", "Great answer. I vote NTA as well, and I appreciate that you\u2019re not going off about OP\u2019s wife being a spendy user. OP says himself that their system works well for them and he\u2019s fine with being the provider for his spouse, but not for her friend.", "Right? He also says she already had 3 grand in her account to begin with totaling over $5000 she spent on a 3 day trip! This leaves me with 2 questions: 1. What the he!! did wife and friend do/buy that cost $5000 in 3 days and 2. What the he!! do he and his wife do for a living that they can afford that at the drop of a hat because apparently hubby and I are in the wrong business lol! \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: Apparently the trip was longer than 3 days but still da@#!", "Yeah I was like damn she had to know redit was going to hand her and the friend out to try on this one.", "No, I assumed the $3000 in the account when she left was sufficient. She never asked for more before leaving.", "It really doesn\u2019t matter. She is in a great position financially and yet she\u2019s still going further and taking advantage of him", "Fuck, I lived over in Scotland for 4 months and only paid out around $6500 including flight (found a good long-term lodging deal on one of Orkney\u2019s smaller islands and cycled pretty much everywhere. It was gorgeous, so we\u2019ll worth it).", "I mean that's not really comparable to the OP at all.", "Does your wife not realize this friend is blatantly using her?", "Right?? I\u2019m scratching my head wondering what I would spend that much money on\u2026 I mean I could imagine chartering a private yacht or deciding I was on a caviar diet this vaycay. But even in my wild fantasies it wouldn\u2019t be spent before I knew I had the budget & had to go asking for extra funds.", "She\u2019s taking advantage of you but you didn\u2019t set any spending boundary or expectation ahead of time. NTA and it\u2019s clearly time to have a serious conversation around finances and financial boundaries.", "That sounds amazing!", "That sounds awesome! I would love to visit Scotland (or anywhere outside the US) but always shy away cause of price.", "Wow. That sounds amazing.", "Yeah i have a feeling the friend kept nudging the wife to pay for things bc she knew how easily you\u2019d be willing to add money to the joint account", "Bro they are both using OP lmao", "If you\u2019re spending shared money and continually draining it, at some point it\u2019s reasonable to assume the wife would have the insight to recognize that maybe she should be more mindful of spending. Saying OP didn\u2019t talk about it ahead of time is a hard cop out, especially when she tried lying about the spend.", "Welcome to the boat I am also in.", "Keep flight trackers on and do your research! I legit have always had cheaper vacations outside of the US compared to in it. This includes Europe, Asia, and Central America. Just have to be patient!", "The secret to visiting Scotland is not to stay in major cities. For visiting Edinburgh or Glasgow stay in one of the small surrounding towns they are much cheaper. They also have good transport links. The Highlands are cheaper out of season ( also less midges). May is a beautiful month to visit.", "OP handed over his checkbook and said, \"Have fun on vacay with your friend\" but didn't set spending limits and wired more money when asked without question. That's borderline sugar daddy behavior, IMO. \n\nWhy would she stop to think \"Oh dear, I've spent $500 at this bar. Hubby sent me $1500 yesterday and it didn't seem to be a problem for him but I should stop spending\".\n\nMy N T A judgment is because she clearly, definitely blew through an enormous chunk of change on vacation. So she's an AH for the aggressive spending. At the same time, OP needs to set limits which he didn't do in this case."]}
