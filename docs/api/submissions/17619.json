So I\u2019m not saying this is what happened\u2026 but when I first moved into my building, the front desk screwed up and told me to park in spot 27. It was empty, so I didn\u2019t think twice. Turns out spot 27 was taken and the woman who paid for that spot was understandably furious but didn\u2019t know who I was. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t tow me and talked to the front desk first. They then yelled at me (??) even though I had the envelope to prove that\u2019s where they told me to park. Thankfully I was home, but it would have sucked if I were out at dinner across town or something.\n\nAgain, not likely. Just sharing an annoying story!", "My take on this was to just block a guy in by improperly parking behind him.  But, that has the caveat that it could very well have opened me up to getting towed, myself.  I was young, in my early 20s.  I think older me, the guy who just hit 40 this year, would just call the damn tow company too.\n\nBut my old apartment complex had some contractors painting the outside of all the buildings.  When they got to my end of the complex, one of them kept parking in my spot every single damn day.  I'd go in to work at 4am and get home after noon.  I think at first he expected to be gone by the time I got home, no harm no foul.  I was annoyed obviously, but figured I could probably make the same erroneous assumption so no harm done.  But, I did need that spot when I got home.  So I told those folks.  Only it kept happening, every single day.  Complaining to the apartment management didn't help.  Talking to the painters didn't help.  Especially by the end when I quit being so polite about it.  So fuck it, I blocked him in and the guy had to go knocking door to door to figure out where I lived.  When I answered, I told him I'd do the same thing again tomorrow and that maybe I won't even feel like answering my door when he comes to knock again.\n\nTo be fair, it did stop after that day at least.  But yeah, I probably could have just ended up being the one with the tow bill handling it like that.  So definitely NTA for towing em'.  That's the way to go that puts you in the most right without direct confrontation.", "If they towed her it was on a warning sign posted in the parking lot too.", "Having kids doesn't entitle you to a parking space you didn't pay for.", "You also gave them additional 30 minutes to resolve this themselves. It was obviously not a quick errand or emergency parking.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nHaving kids is a choice, not a disability, no matter how often people try to act like it is.", "A mom with kids using that spot would only be acceptable (not justifiable!) if it was for a short time, like picking or dropping off a child, picking up takeout, laundry, whatever. You gave them 30 minutes grace period, more than enough to cover for any foreseeable occurrence of the kind.\n\nThis mom was not having an emergency or needing the spot for a short time errand. She was entitled and paid the price for it.\n\nNTA", ">I\u2019ll be waiting for a bit before we use that spot again\n\nI think this would give her an argument to try doing it again. She sees the spot sitting vacant for several days, so she may think getting towed was a fluke, that it was merely by accident that you needed the spot that day. If you could have different friends coming over and parking in that spot for a couple of hours, half a day, whatever, that would puzzle her enough.", "Sometimes delivery people (food, etc) park in the assigned spaces near me, but they are quick and don't stay.  But we also have an issue with people using spots they shouldn't. Fortunately my neighbor is on the ball and contacts management.", "You went above and beyond. I\u2019ll go a step further and say the community regarding disabilities isn\u2019t even relevant. It\u2019s your spot that you pay for. That\u2019s the whole analysis. \n\nYou were kind enough to give them a half hour, LOOK FOR A NOTE, etc\u2026 my goodness. Not even remotely the ah. \n\nIt sucks for that lady for sure, but I imagine she\u2019s going to be much more careful in the future. \n\nOne question I have as I write this\u2026 how long from when tow truck got there did the lady get there with her kids? Was it a coincidence that she was leaving, could the spot be seen from windows of units, etc? That might take her from somewhat sympathetic figure to someone who effed around and found out.
