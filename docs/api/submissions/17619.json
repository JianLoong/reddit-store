And agreed!", "Yeah, I was pretty firm about my decision until my friends chimed in so I decided to turn to good ol\u2019 Reddit to make the call \ud83d\ude02 my friends said BUT she has kids!!! I grew up with a single parent but she never took stuff she didn\u2019t pay for. The spots are clearly marked and the complex has been spamming all the residents with parking regulation emails.

She\u2019s in the next building. We have security cameras and enough deterrents in my house so we should be okay.

Thanks!", "We waited for 30 min and looked for notes, people around the area, etc. The complex has the rules posted at the entrance and throughout. We get spammed with emails about the parking regulations weekly at this point. The apartment managers bailed early again and the customer service after hours wasn\u2019t any help unfortunately. Good question though, I think we did do enough imo. Our pizza was cold by the time this was over :(", "So what if she has kids?? She needs to pay for a spot herself", "Sucks and a good idea. Good luck. Some people just don\u2019t think about anyone but themselves. :/", "Aye, exactly, if there happened to be a note or something then there would be a point of contact. \n\nAnd if they didn't move the car after that... Still nta because they were warned to move.", "Good way to solve your debates!\n\nI find it so weird when people imply that being a mom is somehow an excuse, or at least an excuse to avoid the consequences of one's choice to take advantage of others.\n\nAs if, being a mother means you automatically are struggling in some way, and need others to make exceptions for you. It's bizarre to me.", "Lmao it\u2019s crazy how entitled people are when it\u2019s not their money huh? But they sure as hell shut the fu*k up when you ask em to pay up or do it themselves. Get the good pricey pizza too \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah. Not much more anyone could ask for.

I told someone else here I grew up in a single parent family. Mom worked three jobs, did the best she could, and never took what didn\u2019t belong to her. She\u2019s my hero for sure and taught me a lot about integrity.", "\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f", "That's awesome, sounds like a great hero to have in your life!", "NTA even slightly. I have to do this every few months at my apartment because apparently morons can\u2019t read. That\u2019s their fault for parking on someone else\u2019s property. Makes my blood boil every time.", "NTA you waited 30mins which I think absolutely clears you of any guilt", "NTA , you paid for your spot and followed the rules.", "I agree with you but I imagine a lady like this probably will just think she's in the right and won't even think she was in the wrong, even with the bill...", "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "The signage is big and bright red first thing you see when you get in.

I doubt a parking inspector would let her off getting a fine just because she had kids. \n\nDo you think she was someone's guest? Like shouldn't she have her own free parking spot? If her family has 2 cars then they just need to pay for a second spot.", "People aren't entitled to your things because they decided to have unprotected sex.", "NTA, she\u2019s from the next building which means she\u2019s well aware of the rules, you did nothing wrong at all. Hopefully she learns a lesson in not being entitled.", "Definitely. If there was a note or an actual emergency or a fellow disabled person etc, I would have left it alone.

Keeps me going in this crazy world for sure :)", "NTA.  You were gracious with that half hour plus whatever time it took the tow truck to get there. Don't park in places you shouldn't", "NTA - you\u2019re living in government housing where someone is desperate for a space and for whatever reason running late. \n\nThis is a luxury complex. Park illegally don\u2019t be surprised.", "NTA", ">it\u2019s some lady with kids screaming \n\nIt doesn't matter how many kids she has, it's not her spot. No number of kids makes it okay. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou pay for that spot so it's yours.", "NTA - you pay for the spot, tow their ass", "NTA. You pay for your spot and if it is clearly marked then the person who parked there knew she shouldn\u2019t be parking there and can face the consequences.", "NTA.   Tow them all that park in your spot", "As long as the space is clearly marked, you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou pay for the spot.\n\nYou are entitled to remove anyone who thinks they can just use what you pay for. You waited 25 minutes longer than I would have done.", "Is the spot marked plainly? If so, nta. It's your spot!", "NTA  keep up the good work", "NTA, it is your spot. You pay for it. She played the odds and she lost. \n\nDon't feel bad.", "I love a shiny spine that calls the tow truck. I am addicted to these stories. \n\nNTA", "It's a clear reminder for her to check the fuck around & find out chart before parking in another persons spot.  The find out part was a clear 6 with her car being towed.", "NTA. \n\nYou pay a premium for that spot.", "Then you waited 30 minutes.", "Also\u2026 your two friends who think you are the asshole are the ones who would park in someone else\u2019s spot and simply expect the world to accommodate them instead of taking responsibility for their actions. \n\nJust keep that in your mind as you move forward in your interactions with these folks.\n\nYou don\u2019t pay 80 bucks a month for other people to park for free.", "We have that issue in my building too. Rather than a tow truck, people constantly complain to the management. One guy parked his car directly behind a car that took up his parking space that he paid for because he was so sick of it. People need to learn not to take advantage of other people.\n\nNTA.", "You are definitely NTA. I go to clients' homes for my job and often have a second person driving another car to meet me. I have to remind one guy all the damn time to stop parking in reserved parking spaces that don't belong to the client after he got in a yelling match with someone over stealing their spot. It's really unacceptable.", "It doesn't matter what she believes, only what she does. She will think twice about parking in private spaces in future, even if she thinks she should be entitled to park in them. NTA", "I think giving her a half hour was more than generous. Totally takes you out of AH territory and into \u201cnice guy\u201d territory. It means someone wasn\u2019t like \u201coh shit I gotta run in and pee before leaving\u201d or something. \n\nIf you did it the second you saw it, it\u2019s still in your rights I suppose. But you went out of your way to see if it would resolve.", "A family near me with no placard used to ALWAYS park in the handicapped spot because it was right outside their unit, and it really put a bee in my Bonnet since my mom is disabled. After contacting management they asked for photo evidence, so every day for a week I took a picture with a timestamp to show they weren't all taken at once. After that, they never parked in that spot again.\n\nSometimes contacting management is all you can do. Good for you doing so.", "I\u2019d do the opposite and use it every day. If she keeps seeing it empty she\u2019s going to feel more justified in \u201cit\u2019s never used, I was only a minute!\u201d", "So she's teaching them to do something that is wrong and not to take responsibility for it. She's THA.", "Why would having kids matter in this situation? Unless one of kids is disabled and is not of a portable size. Having kids doesn't mean you can't afford the tow charge either.  You said you live somewhere expensive. \n\nNTA. Your friends' opinion doesn't make sense to me. They're arguing people with children should get accommodations at other people's expense just for having kids.", "The kids just learned a good lesson about consequences. Having kids doesn't mean the rules don't apply.", "What a dummy!  If I had parked in your space I would have driven in so my front wheels couldn't be easily raised - way harder to tow from a crowded parking lot.\n\nNTA", "She has kids... she should be more responsible and less risk taking.", "This is such a good point.", "The two friends also seem kinda ableist if they think it's reasonable that two people with mobility issues / disabilities should have to park elsewhere and walk farther. NTA", "I was just saying sometimes, while shit like this happens, even people like the lady in question sometimes don't learn from mistakes, even if they cost money. She may think she isn't in the wrong.  \n That was more of what I meant to say!  \n\n\nNTA definitely", "I said something similar upthread -- this seems pretty damn ableist. Playing the \"but what about the children\" card as if it trumps disabilities is a big yikes. I know Reddit is unreasonably quick to say to cut off relationships with friends and family, but I genuinely wouldn't be able to be friends with someone who was so dismissive of disabilities.", "I see your point. Well, other people will profit from her arrogance when her car is towed away next time."]}
