High rent, fees for everything, that whole deal. We have one free parking spot which is always occupied by our car. We pay $50 a month for an additional parking spot we use for our guests since we host get-togethers frequently. In addition it\u2019s a $30 fee for a mandatory placard that is required to hang in the car. So $80 a month. For parking.\nSome of our guests/friends/family are disabled and the spot we pay for helps them access our place easier. \n\nCue the situation. Today is friend dinner day. My friend who has mobility issues and is disabled calls me to tell me our $80 month spot is occupied. We wait in case it\u2019s a delivery/courier driver. 30 minutes pass by. It\u2019s clear this person isn\u2019t leaving. We\u2019ve already wasted half an hour of our time. \n\nI say screw it and call the tow company. I\u2019m disabled myself so this situation caused me issues as well. The tow truck gets here and it\u2019s some lady with kids screaming at the tow truck guy. He leaves with her car after a large traffic jam and some audience watching the fiasco. \n\nI think I did nothing wrong. I work my butt off to pay for a spot I use a lot. I\u2019m tired of entitled people thinking they can just get away with stuff especially taking things they don\u2019t pay for. Two of my friends think I went too far. I disagree.

She knew she couldn\u2019t park there but did it anyway. It\u2019s her fault she was towed. Maybe next time she will think twice about parking in some Mr one else\u2019s spot.", "NTA. It\u2019s says something about today\u2019s entitled and inconsiderate society that you would even second guess what you did. What is the argument your friends use that say you went too far?\n\nIf someone blocked my driveway I would not hesitate for a second to get it towed. \n\nI\u2019m saying this assuming the spot is clearly marked as reserved?", "NTA you are literally paying for the privilege of that spot. Someone decided to use a spot they were not entitled to use. Then you waited 30 minutes.", "NTA. I think the only reason you might feel bad is because it\u2019s a mom with kids but it doesn\u2019t matter who it is. It\u2019s your spot and you paid/pay for it.", "NTA. People who don\u2019t pay for the spot shouldn\u2019t use it. You had a real need for it on top of it. Doesn\u2019t matter why. Be careful if she lives in the complex. Sometimes these entitled people decide to vandalize property when they don\u2019t get their way.", "NTA \n\nreasons or not.

This is justice porn.", "NTA. Waiting 30 minutes was more than enough accommodation. In my experience, apartment/condo complex residents will openly violate parking rules until there is an actual consequence. Often they\u2019ll get away with using others\u2019 spots (or violating guest parking rules) for a long time because people don\u2019t want to rock the boat. Props for enforcing your right to use the parking spot you paid for.", "NTA - tell your friends if they got their feeling hurt they can pay you $80 a month to have random people park in your spot if they won\u2019t then they need to shut up and mind their business.\nEdit : get dash cams and if she messes with your car have her charged to get it fixed :) .", "It's a designated spot so NTA for calling a tow.

And agreed!", "Yeah, I was pretty firm about my decision until my friends chimed in so I decided to turn to good ol\u2019 Reddit to make the call \ud83d\ude02 my friends said BUT she has kids!!! I grew up with a single parent but she never took stuff she didn\u2019t pay for. The spots are clearly marked and the complex has been spamming all the residents with parking regulation emails. Clearly they were ignored \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you! :)", "Definitely a good point, I decided to ask Reddit in the off chance that I was the bad guy who got the mom\u2019s car towed\u2026\ud83d\ude15", "Yeah, she was pretty \u201cvocal\u201d and I was counting on it. She\u2019s in the next building. We have security cameras and enough deterrents in my house so we should be okay. I\u2019ll be waiting for a bit before we use that spot again so she can cool down.", "I forgot to mention this-we did look for a note because maybe it was an emergency.

I try and be kind and give the benefit of the doubt but unfortunately there\u2019s many entitled people who do things and get away with it. I got tired of it today lol.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I like this idea! $80 and a hot pizza too! Yeah I have a dashcam on the way now because you never know nowadays! Thanks!", "We waited for 30 min and looked for notes, people around the area, etc. The complex has the rules posted at the entrance and throughout. We get spammed with emails about the parking regulations weekly at this point. The apartment managers bailed early again and the customer service after hours wasn\u2019t any help unfortunately. Good question though, I think we did do enough imo. Our pizza was cold by the time this was over :(", "So what if she has kids?? She needs to pay for a spot herself", "Sucks and a good idea. Good luck. Some people just don\u2019t think about anyone but themselves. :/", "Aye, exactly, if there happened to be a note or something then there would be a point of contact. \n\nAnd if they didn't move the car after that... Still nta because they were warned to move.", "Good way to solve your debates!\n\nI find it so weird when people imply that being a mom is somehow an excuse, or at least an excuse to avoid the consequences of one's choice to take advantage of others.\n\nAs if, being a mother means you automatically are struggling in some way, and need others to make exceptions for you. It's bizarre to me.", "Lmao it\u2019s crazy how entitled people are when it\u2019s not their money huh? But they sure as hell shut the fu*k up when you ask em to pay up or do it themselves. Get the good pricey pizza too \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah. Not much more anyone could ask for. If the owner of the car wants to complain just point to all those things and say that it's the driver's fault and the building management's problem to deal with for leaving early. \n\nEven more so NTA!", "TRUTH!! \ud83d\ude4f", "Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s a bummer to see that. I try and be nice to people as best as I can but the entitlement of some people make me pretty mad sometimes\u2026\nThanks for the well wishes\ud83d\ude4f", "I\u2019ve gotten some pretty good input from Reddit so it\u2019s become a fun go to. I told someone else here I grew up in a single parent family. Mom worked three jobs, did the best she could, and never took what didn\u2019t belong to her. She\u2019s my hero for sure and taught me a lot about integrity.", "\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f", "That's awesome, sounds like a great hero to have in your life!", "NTA even slightly. I have to do this every few months at my apartment because apparently morons can\u2019t read. That\u2019s their fault for parking on someone else\u2019s property. Makes my blood boil every time.", "NTA you waited 30mins which I think absolutely clears you of any guilt", "NTA , you paid for your spot and followed the rules.", "I agree with you but I imagine a lady like this probably will just think she's in the right and won't even think she was in the wrong, even with the bill...", "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "The signage is big and bright red first thing you see when you get in. Can\u2019t miss it \ud83d\ude02\nThe lady and management definitely could get their own post on AITA so many issues.

I doubt a parking inspector would let her off getting a fine just because she had kids. \n\nDo you think she was someone's guest? Like shouldn't she have her own free parking spot? If her family has 2 cars then they just need to pay for a second spot.", "People aren't entitled to your things because they decided to have unprotected sex.", "NTA, she\u2019s from the next building which means she\u2019s well aware of the rules, you did nothing wrong at all. Hopefully she learns a lesson in not being entitled.", "Definitely. If there was a note or an actual emergency or a fellow disabled person etc, I would have left it alone. Emergencies I\u2019m definitely understanding of\u2026entitlement\u2026nope.", "I know right?! They talk the talk and then disappear after!\nOh yes they are treating me to the expensive pizza next week. Reddit has spoken \ud83c\udfc6", "Definitely.
