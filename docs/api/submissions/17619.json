So I\u2019m not saying this is what happened\u2026 but when I first moved into my building, the front desk screwed up and told me to park in spot 27. It was empty, so I didn\u2019t think twice. Turns out spot 27 was taken and the woman who paid for that spot was understandably furious but didn\u2019t know who I was. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t tow me and talked to the front desk first. They then yelled at me (??) even though I had the envelope to prove that\u2019s where they told me to park. Thankfully I was home, but it would have sucked if I were out at dinner across town or something.\n\nAgain, not likely. Just sharing an annoying story!", "My take on this was to just block a guy in by improperly parking behind him.  But, that has the caveat that it could very well have opened me up to getting towed, myself.  I was young, in my early 20s.  I think older me, the guy who just hit 40 this year, would just call the damn tow company too.\n\nBut my old apartment complex had some contractors painting the outside of all the buildings.  When they got to my end of the complex, one of them kept parking in my spot every single damn day.  I'd go in to work at 4am and get home after noon.  I think at first he expected to be gone by the time I got home, no harm no foul.  I was annoyed obviously, but figured I could probably make the same erroneous assumption so no harm done.  But, I did need that spot when I got home.  So I told those folks.  Only it kept happening, every single day.  Complaining to the apartment management didn't help.  Talking to the painters didn't help.  Especially by the end when I quit being so polite about it.  So fuck it, I blocked him in and the guy had to go knocking door to door to figure out where I lived.  When I answered, I told him I'd do the same thing again tomorrow and that maybe I won't even feel like answering my door when he comes to knock again.\n\nTo be fair, it did stop after that day at least.  But yeah, I probably could have just ended up being the one with the tow bill handling it like that.  So definitely NTA for towing em'.  That's the way to go that puts you in the most right without direct confrontation.", "If they towed her it was on a warning sign posted in the parking lot too.", "Having kids doesn't entitle you to a parking space you didn't pay for.", "You also gave them additional 30 minutes to resolve this themselves. It was obviously not a quick errand or emergency parking.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nHaving kids is a choice, not a disability, no matter how often people try to act like it is.", "A mom with kids using that spot would only be acceptable (not justifiable!) if it was for a short time, like picking or dropping off a child, picking up takeout, laundry, whatever. You gave them 30 minutes grace period, more than enough to cover for any foreseeable occurrence of the kind.\n\nThis mom was not having an emergency or needing the spot for a short time errand. She was entitled and paid the price for it.\n\nNTA", ">I\u2019ll be waiting for a bit before we use that spot again\n\nI think this would give her an argument to try doing it again. She sees the spot sitting vacant for several days, so she may think getting towed was a fluke, that it was merely by accident that you needed the spot that day. If you could have different friends coming over and parking in that spot for a couple of hours, half a day, whatever, that would puzzle her enough.", "Sometimes delivery people (food, etc) park in the assigned spaces near me, but they are quick and don't stay.  But we also have an issue with people using spots they shouldn't. Fortunately my neighbor is on the ball and contacts management.", "You went above and beyond.

Not even remotely the ah. \n\nIt sucks for that lady for sure, but I imagine she\u2019s going to be much more careful in the future. \n\nOne question I have as I write this\u2026 how long from when tow truck got there did the lady get there with her kids?

She has learned not to ever park in anyone\u2019s spot again!", "NTA.

Weird", "Is the spot clearly marked as private / reserved? If yes, then NTA.", "I never think someone is an asshole for enforcing established rules.", "NTA but Did we figure out who the lady was and why she was there?", "NTA- it's common sense to make sure you are parking in the correct spot, especially in an apartment complex as most of them have free parking spots and paid parking spots.

I assume the spot is clearly marked as permit only and towing info is noted, this person just felt entitled to leave their care there for quite some time.  Hopefully she learns to not do that again.", "NTA  \nUnless she's also handicapped and had it marked on her car, she sounds like she was just being entitled (either straight entitled or what I've coined 'tired entitled' bc of her kids). Either way, as someone who has tried the whole 'oh, be nice and try to track them down' thing before, I'm never doing that again and you shouldn't have to either. She parked illegally or at least immorally, that's on her.", "How would you BTA, you paid for the spot, PERIOD. She's not entitled to the extra bedroom in your apartment because she has more kids than bedrooms....", "NTA, it would've been different is she came and asked if she could borrow the spot instead.

Stupid actions deserve stupid consequences.", "NTA at all we have people who frequently park so we can back out of our driveway but the place we live won\u2019t do anything because technically they aren\u2019t on the street.

Parling was free at my place, but you could pay extra for an assigned spot. I bought one right in front of my building because my SO was pregnant and we had a 1 year old at the time, so it was easier for her. Everyone tried to park there because it was the best spot and always open. I towed EVERYONE.  All the time. Never lost a night sleep over it. Don't feel bad.", "> my friends said BUT she has kids!!!\n\nThat she has kids is probably why she felt it was her right to use the spot.

It\u2019s the one who pays for the spot that has the right to use it.", "Whether they learn depends on how much it costs for her. Is she a single mom struggling to pay the bills? She'll think twice next day. Does she earn six figures and have a nanny to take care of the children? Doesn\u2019t care, keeps being entitled. \n\nOf course there's always the odd one out who doesn't learn and think their entitlement is worth more than any amount of money, even if they don't have any. Those people never learn, regardless.\n\nEdit: typo's", "I agree. I was trying to parce through the friends thought processes."]}
