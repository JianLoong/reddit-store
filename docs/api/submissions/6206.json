An adult getting butthurt because his gift isn't the winner is a bit much.  His ego is getting in the way there.\n\nMy SIL from my ex is still a good friend of mine.  She jokes about winning Christmas with the kids because she usually gets them toys and I get them more practical stuff (Santa brought the fun stuff when they believed).  She also gets them stuff I normally wouldn't.  I don't get upset because she wants them to be just as happy as I do when they open the gifts.  I know her toys are going to win compared to my books and clothes.  Has she turned it into a competition?  Nope.  I still get them what I get them.  I let her \"win\" because that's important to her.  She doesn't see them every day like I do.  I they get really excited to see her because of it. Could I use the extra fun parent cred, probably, but IDGAF.  It makes her happy to win, so she can win.  \n\nHe should be excited about the fact that you hit the nail on the head every year.  Shit, he should be asking you what to get her.  LOL When you two start going in on gifts together, he'll be able to take credit for the great ideas as well. Hint at something like that if it won't upset him.   \n\nYou're NTA for this now, but if you continue knowing it upsets your BF, you would be.  Just keep on getting her the awesome gifts, but don't ask her what her favorite is.", "How I look at this situation is that you were probably excited about the gift you selected so you asked the girl about her favourite gift. But kids are brutally honest and since she liked your gifts before too this may have been a trigger for your boyfriend that maybe he doesn't put in the same effort or that he simply isn't doing enough for his daughter.\n\nIt's also just not good to ask little kids questions like these because it's basically a way for you to get them to pick favourites. \n\nI feel like there is a lot of missing pieces in this story. \n\nINFO: Is the boyfriend close to his daughter?\n\nBecause if he is close, then NTA.", "YTA\n\nThere literally no reason to rank one present over another except to hurt feelings.", "> I was simply curious because who doesn't have a favorite present. \n\nYeah but it's rude to ask and rude to tell.\n\nYTA.", "Nta I feel like you were just making conversation.  We do it in pediatric dentistry.  Your bf is insecure for some reason.  I mean he should be glad she got something she really liked", "[deleted]", "Nta.

One that lots of people ask children on present opening days.", "NTA.\n\nYou were simply curious, although it\u2018s a weird question to ask.\n\nYour boyfriend is an AH though for complaining solely due to his own insecurities and ego.

I never said she was a nice person. I acknowledged that she has a weird jealousy issue. She's still not the biggest asshole in this kid's life - that title would belong entirely to the kid's parents.

As far as I can see, both parents are drug users with a plethora of mental issues.\n\nOP is okay to leave a child there as long as her actions are seen, praised amd validated.\n\nIt's not healthy and it's not looking pretty.", "wow, idk but I kinda feel disgusted by the age gap and the fact the younger one is just 18."]}
