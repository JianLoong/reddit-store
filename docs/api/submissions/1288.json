Hi, I (20NB) have a terrible relationship with my mom. She's a narcissist, was abusive, etc. Recently (yesterday) I posted something about her saying she never said she was proud of me etc, and I haved her blocked everywhere, phone, socials, yadda. \n\nShe was apparently using her wife and my little sister to spy on me. They told her about my post and she complained to my sister who is on her side. She keeps telling me to apologize and stuff, but I'm not apologizing for posting the truth. This is the second time something on social media has caused her(mother) to be mad at me. The first time was when she accused me of posting about her. Then now when I actually did post about her.\n\nShe keeps calling my sister (who I live with) to complain, and my sister is tired of being the middle man. I just blocked my moms number after I almost sent her a text cursing her out and calling her on her shit. I copied the message to my notes and blocked her number instead of starting an arguement. I havent spoken to my mom in a while now and I want her to just acknowledge her mistakes!\n\nOther than that I'm not apologizing first for posting the truth. It was an image of someones mom saying they were proud of their child and I posted it on my instagra story, with the caption, \"I wish my mom woulda said stuff like this to me but nooo nothing I did was ever good enough for her,\" i guess my other mother saw it and snitched (not cool E). None of them have reddit so I dont have to worry about them seeing this. The only person on my side are my friends. Everyone else keeps calling me an asshole and I keep hearing it the most from my sister.\n\nSo AITA for not apologizing first?", "created_utc": 1667585001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym5ttj/aita_for_not_apologizing_first_to_my_mom_for/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
