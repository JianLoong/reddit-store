You go to the cinema to watch a film, not talk. The last couple of times I've been to the cinema I've had to ask people to stop chatting...

I would get them kicked out too.", "NTA. \n\nWith cinema prices these days I absolutely wouldn't tolerate a bunch of urchins ruining my experience either.

Actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter how old they are.  They can settle down and be quiet while watching a movie in a theater.  That's just common courtesy.  Or at least it **was** pre-COVID.  I've heard that, since then, more and more customers are unbelievably rude AHs.  This is from people who work in theaters.\n\nThe kids are absolutely the AHs here.  If they're at least teenagers, they can be quiet while watching a movie.  And if they're younger than that, their parents should be with them and should make them be quiet, or remove them from the theater.\n\nFrom the way they acted, it seems like they **wanted** to piss people off.  Which obviously makes them the AHs.  Your GF is completely wrong here.", "More concerning your girlfriend needs to people please middle school kids & is embarrassed by an adult wanting their movie quiet.", "What were middle school kids doing unsupervised in an R-rated movie?\n\nI mean, I don't think that sneaking into a different movie is the end of the world, but acting like AHs and getting kicked out is kinda stupid.\n\nNTA.  Movies are too expensive to put up with crap.", "NTA. Maybe I'm getting old, but I also cannot *stand* it when I pay good money to see a movie in theaters, and everyone is talking, texting with their screens on super bright, etc. If you want to talk during a movie, do it at home. If a text is really that important, at least get up and move to the entrance of the theater/room so your bright ass phone isn't distracting and blinding everyone behind you. \n\nThe all-important lesson of, \"there are consequences to your actions\" was given.

If I pay money to watch something in the cinema, then I am not going to sit and take it when I can't hear the film and have kids acting stupid. Kids being kids is not an excuse, I never behaved like that in public because I was brought up to have respect for those around me. You weren't acting like there dad, you didn't turn around and give them a stern talking to whilst wagging your finger. You complained to staff about a bunch of young idiots trying to intimidate you and taking your photo. That is not okay.", "NTA.

You GF is okay with bad behavior kids being kids\u2026 that is terrible.", "NTA fuck having to put up with that, they got what they deserved. Justice served.", "NTA. They were disruptive and began actually harrassing you when they were faced with consequences.   \nI do understand your GF's side, it sounds like she isn't a fan of confrontation. BUT that doesn't mean you were wrong. It's good that these kids learned that there are certain social rules that people need to follow in such social settings. Their behaviour sounds like they're bullies and you (and others) didn't stand for it.", "NTA. The kids\u2019 behavior was not acceptable and they need to learn that before they grow up into adult assholes.", "NTA. It\u2019s within your rights to want to enjoy a movie you paid money to be at. A cinema is not a playground for kids.", "NTA at all. There are certain expectations to be followed in a movie theater. They were not following those by being disrespectful & disruptive, and needed to be held accountable. Your girlfriend is the AH though.", "NTA \n\nWhy would someone not complain about loud noises and things being thrown at them during a movie you've paid to watch ? \n\nAt that age, I would've never even dreamed of acting like that. I wonder wtf have their parents teached them ?!", "NTA. I learned from a preacher on the TV show Firefly that there's a special place in hell for people who talk at the theater.", "NTA. Isn't that movie rated R? They aren't even allowed in there without an adult which means the theater has a responsibility to remove them regardless of how they behaved. And since they were acting like that, they were incredibly stupid. If they managed to sneak by they should have just sat quietly and not drawn attention to themselves. \n\nYou didn't get them kicked out. They got themselves kicked out.

Kick ur gf out with them next time and enjoy your movie in true peace.", "NTA", "NTA, middle schoolers are expected to act the same way as any other paying customer.

You're supposed to let kids run wild, flip you off, take photos of you, and ruin the movie?", "There are movie chains that are hardcore about kicking people out for that sort of thing - Alamo Drafthouse is one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA they were being rude and ruining the movie for everyone. there\u2019s no excuse for behaving like that at the movies. The only one to blame for getting kicked out is them, they\u2019re old enough to know better and were warned\n\n(edit for spelling lol)", "NTA. If you weren\u2019t justified in your actions then the usher wouldn\u2019t have kicked them out.

It was a learning experience those kids obviously needed. People really need to learn to be respectful while in a movie theater. People pay quite a bit these days to go to movies now, a fairly quiet space is the least you should get.\n\n(Speaking as someone who had a parent in their showing who brought a four year old and a baby.    Edited: Damn out. That felt a bit rough. It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault their parent isn\u2019t too smart or reasonable.)", "NTA. The theater should have kicked them all out.", "NTA they weren\u2019t there for the movie, they were there to impress each other with their badassery. They\u2019re off bragging about how they got kicked out of the theatre.", "NTA\n\nAt first I thought it was just bc they snuck into an R rated movie (which would have changed my vote).

Don\u2019t go to the theater/movies.", "NTA, you did everyone there a favor.", "NTA. I actually stopped taking my middle school daughter to the theater once I was a chaperone and saw how her and her friends acted.  Just loud and obnoxious. It\u2019s not uncommon for kids that age so I wouldn\u2019t really be mad at them personally as many of us were dumb at that age but it has consequences. No need to be a doormat and waste money having a bad time at the movies because kids can\u2019t behave. I\u2019d do the same thing.", "[removed]", "NTA. At this point, imo, you were performing a civic duty. Screws those kids. \n\nThe last movie I saw in a theater was It part 2. I had the same experience except management wouldn\u2019t kick anyone out or even ask them to calm down because there were too many kids. \u201cThey always do this.\u201d What??? Blew my mind that the solution was to give me free tickets instead of helping to educate people on public behavior. My solution was to build a home theater solution and never go to the movies again.", "Forget \"kids being kids.\" \n\nIf people don't know how to behave in a movie theater, no matter their age, they do not belong there. And given the cost of parking, tickets, and refreshments to enjoy a movie, no one has time for that nonsense. NTA.", "Soft NTA\n\nIf you had complained, that's fine, 'kids being kids' is a shitty excuse for bad behaviour. If you're old enough to be unsupervised you're old enough to reap the rewards of your actions.\n\nPointing them out, fine. Again, reap what you sow.\n\nSwearing at them as they goaded you, little bit of a dick move, and at that point they got a rise out of you, so they *win*. Just ignore, they're on their way out.\n\nWould definitely suggest a chat with the gf once things have cooled down, just to understand what about it made her uncomfortable, and if there's a way you could get the same result that she would be happier with. Make it clear that the screening was important to you, but also listen to what she says.", "NTA, but sometimes you can find another solution: let them have their fun, and you ask the manager for a refund, or go see another movie, or grab a beer and catch the next showing...", "Scream 6?  The studio execs who greenlighted Screams 2-6 get an ahole mark\n\nThe kids are obvious aholes. \n\nYou get an ahole mark for flipping the kids off. Really immature and stupid for you swallowing the bait. That\u2019s probably what spoiled it for your gf. Should have said nothing and gotten the manager to deal with it. \n\nThe parents of these kids are the biggest aholes. That many young kids unchaperoned was a recipe for obnoxious behavior. Who didn\u2019t see that coming?\n\nESH, especially the kids and their useless parents. You acted immature too.", "ESH-your girlfriend is right, they are a bunch of kids acting like children. It makes them suck to adults, but you responding like that is kind of an AH move. Most theaters will give you a refund or free pass for another viewing if the experience isn\u2019t to your satisfaction.
