In my mind there\u2019s only two possibilities- either your wife strong-armed her into doing it or she\u2019s just taking advantage of this poor lady trying to do her job.  Your wife is a major AH on this count alone.\n\nBut you also suck here by thinking you\u2019ve come up with a clever way to remove some responsibility from your plate.  You\u2019re proud of yourself for having extra money to buy some free time for you only.  You *say* you\u2019re buying time with your kid, but the most telling thing is that you don\u2019t put the priority on lessening your and your wife\u2019s collective load.
