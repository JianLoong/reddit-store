How is this safe for your child and why is that not your primary concern?  Is she bringing them to every room as she cleans?  I doubt that.  And how in the world was this cleaning lady ok with doing this?  In my mind there\u2019s only two possibilities- either your wife strong-armed her into doing it or she\u2019s just taking advantage of this poor lady trying to do her job.  Your wife is a major AH on this count alone.\n\nBut you also suck here by thinking you\u2019ve come up with a clever way to remove some responsibility from your plate.  You\u2019re proud of yourself for having extra money to buy some free time for you only.  You *say* you\u2019re buying time with your kid, but the most telling thing is that you don\u2019t put the priority on lessening your and your wife\u2019s collective load.  And, I\u2019m sorry, but 80% of child care is way more taxing than house cleaning any day of the week so you lose more points with me there too.\n\nESH", "This, 100%.  Cleaning person and nanny are two very different things.  NTA and I suggest a conversation with cleaning lady to let her know she is not expected to babysit and to let you know if it happens again.", "Do you suggest that they should both do things they don't like, just so that it's \"fair\"? Fair is both people being content with the arrangement. 50/50 on everything rarely makes people happy.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how they split child/house care, as long as both sides are content with the arrangement. Not all families can do 50/50, nor is 50/50 always appropriate; everyone\u2019s circumstances are different.\n\nThe stupid action here is OP\u2019s wife leaving their kids with a cleaning lady. Its not their job, they\u2019re not trained or equipped for it, and they aren\u2019t insured for child care. It\u2019s massively irresponsible.", "If OP didn't like taking care of kids, he should have had a couple of them.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a perfect 50/50 but more equal than 80/20. \n\nSounds like OP wanted a break from cleaning and more time with his kids, as well as more personal time. And so did his wife (although she is more than an asshole than him as she still doesn't want to clean more even if she has less \"childcare responsibilities\"). \n\nSounds to me like something needs to change.\n\nAnd I want to add that maybe the kids would like to have more time with their father... but who cares about the kids...", "Do they seem content?", "Absent any other information it appears that they were.  Until the wife started taking advantage of the house cleaner by having her watch the kids."]}
