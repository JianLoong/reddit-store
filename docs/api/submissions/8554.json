''Kat'' aged 19, ''Cole'' aged 26 ''Olivia'' aged 32.\n\nOlivia married her boyfriend of 8 years  ''Carlos'' 29. They had known each other for a long time, and used to be very close before dating. He was very close to Kat too, and was Cole's best friend.\n\nMy son Cole is gay. He came out when he was 17 years old and my husband and I are very supportive of him. Cole also revealed to me (before Olivia dated him) that he liked Carlos. He said he had liked him for a long time, but he didn't know how to make the first move. He never made the first move and Olivia and Carlos started dating. Cole was devastated.\n\nNow let's go to 2022. Olivia announced to me that she was going to marry Carlos, and she wanted me to attend. I told her I wasn't sure about going. She asked me why, but I told her I just wasn't sure if I could make it. She dropped the subject.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, she asked me again if I could attend, and I told her I wasn't sure. She asked why again and I gave her the same answer. This time he insisted that she needed my answer right away, to organize the wedding well. I told her that I would not attend. She asked me why, and I told her that Cole felt really bad, because he still likes Carlos.\n\nCole called me angrily, telling me to mind my own business, that I had no right to tell Olivia about his crush on Carlos, and that i had betrayed his trust, and now Olivia was mad at him too. He didn't give me time to respond and hung up angrily. Kat also called me, and told me that she was very disappointed in me, that Olivia was too, and that now Carlos and Olivia don't know whether to invite Cole or not.\n\nThe guys talked to Javier about the situation and he got really angry, but he asked me to come to the wedding and apologize to everyone. I told him that i didn't have to apologize, because i had only done what i thought was best for my son.\n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674955170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nv7oa/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_why_i_wont_attend/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't understand why you refused to attend the wedding when Cole never asked you to? What exactly were you hoping to accomplish here?\n\nAlso, you even said that Cole referred to it as a crush. So it doesn't sound like he was even upset about the wedding. Is there some story missing here? Or did you just feel like meddling?", "YTA. \n\nA) You're prioritizing a CRUSH your son has over your daughter's relationship of EIGHT YEARS to someone she's marrying, possibly having children with, etc. You are flat out saying that you care more about your son's CRUSH than your daughter's entire life. \n\n\nB) Cole didn't want you telling anyone about the crush. Why would you think that is okay? It's someone who will be in his life forever as his sister's husband. Do you think he really wants that in the open? It's been 8 years, he had the opportunity to say something if he wanted to. Has he really not gotten over it? And, if he actually hasn't gotten over a crush in eight years from when he was 18, then he probably needs therapy to move on. Is Carlos even interested in men?\n\n\nYou are an AH parent to Olivia and to Cole.", "YTA\n\nWhat the actual fuck?\n\n#You never had ANY reason not to want to attend the wedding.\n\n> Cole called me angrily, telling me to mind my own business, that I had no right to tell Olivia about his crush on Carlos\n\nThe one he mentioned once, YEARS ago? Yeah, fucking a.", "Ok but what about doing the best for both of your children and not just your son? Why weren't you sure whether you would attend or not? Did you seriously consider skipping your daughter's wedding because her brother might still have feelings for her boyfriend? That's utterly ridiculous and quite frankly, none of your business. That's your son's problem and desicion on whether to attend or not.\n\nGo and apologise, you seriously fucked up. You made a mountain out of a molehill. This whole thing wasn't a problem until you made it one.\n\nYta big time.", "YTA. You made everything about yourself. The wedding, your son's feelings, everybody's relationships.\n\nCole knew he had lost his chance. It was not on you to \"defend him\" when he probably would have liked to go to the wedding. Now you ruined his relationship with his sister.\n\nCongrats on blowing up your family.", "You have more than 1 child. YTA. Apologize to your kids.", "YTA. You are putting one child over the other. It\u2019s not Olivia\u2019s fault that Cole had an unrequited love for Carlos. It\u2019s something that Cole needs to get over, and you need to stay neutral in. You should be supporting your daughter on what is supposed to be the biggest day of her life. Yes I get you want to give Cole a shoulder to cry on, but he needs to get over it. Major AH mum.", "YTA-You owe your children apologies. You didn\u2019t do what was best for anyone. You really overstepped here.", "YTA\n\nAn ancient crush is no reason to not attend your daughter's wedding. A mother not attending her daughters wedding is a serious message and indicates significant relationship breakdown or drama.\n\nAlso, the details you've added likely enough to make your identity obvious to your children redditors, you should at least fuzz the ages or other details, e.g. drop an uninvolved sibling or add another.", "YTA. Your son didn\u2019t ask you to do this, your son had a crush and confided in you, it doesn\u2019t sound like your son wasn\u2019t going to go. You made a mess here.", "YTA.\n\nI can't BELIEVE you did this to any of your children!  That's your DAUGHTER who didn't steal ANYONE.   And, your poor son.  Now he's humiliated. \n\nHUGE EPIC Fail!", "YTA. Are you seriously not going to attend your own daughters wedding because you son has a crush on her husband-to-be? Outrageous!", "YTA. For outing Cole's feelings, and for not going to the wedding. \n\nCarlos can't help that he is straight and loves Olivia. Olivia does not need to be shunned for loving Carlos. Cole also can't help how he feels. None of that is anyone's fault, and no sides needed to be taken, yet here we are.", "YTA. One you are supporting one child over the others in a situation where none of them are in the wrong. Two while it is great that you support your gay son, its not even relevant here. If your other daughter had been the one with the crush instead the situation would be identical. While it is unfortunate he never got to explore the crush it is not as though his sister and fianc\u00e9 got together or are getting married to be malicious toward him. You've betrayed the trust of your son and your daughters  now see who the favorite is. If you want any kind of relationship with your children in the future I suggest you go and apologize.", "Yikes. Somehow you managed to upset everyone in your family. I think that's usually a pretty good indicator that YTA.", "YTA - clearly your son means more to you than your daughter. \n\nJust because Cole has a crush doesn\u2019t mean that Carlos was ever attainable (given his sexuality) \n\nYour relationship with your daughter will never be the same", "YTA. You\u2019re not attending your daughter\u2019s wedding because your son had a crush MORE THAN 8 YEARS AGO? Just\u2026why?", "YTA.\n\nAnd a stupid person as well. You expect Carlos to change his sexual preferences just because your son likes him? That\u2019s not how it works. You can\u2019t just wake up one day and say, I\u2019m going to be gay today. \n\nPeople like you is the reason it\u2019s so hard for the LGBTQ community.

She didn't date him maliciously, she clearly loves him, she's done nothing wrong. You've also decided that a teenage crush was more important than her wedding which wow.\n\nYou're also in general an asshole because you've just destroyed your entire family dynamic for no reason. Cole is mad at you and humiliated. Olivia is mad at you and doesn't know if she can trust her brother because of you (Cole didn't do anything wrong) your husband and your other daughter are trying to do damage control and you're refusing to even apologise or admit you were wrong.\n\nDon't know how you could have got this more wrong to be honest", "YTA\n\n>I told him that i didn't have to apologize, because i had only done what i thought was best for my son. \n\nA. You did not do what's best for your son. You revealed a secret he told you not to share and caused him a lot of drama. You've created unnecessary tension between him and his sister. \n\nB. Olivia and Carlos have been together for 8 years. If Cole still has romantic feelings for Carlos, then he needs to do some work to move on. You also need to respect that Olivia has a life with Carlos. Do you even care about her feelings?\n\nC. Do you really not care about seeing your own daughter get married because your other kid happens to like the groom? \n\nWhat did you expect would happen? That Olivia would be okay with her own mom skipping the wedding?", "YTA\n\nLady, your son didn't say anything, Carlos is straight (presumably), not interested in him, and DATING HIS SISTER. he had the common sense to keep this to himself and work on his emotions quietly, you outed his feelings to everyone, harming not only your relationship with your daughter but the relationship between your daughter, your son and your future son in law.\n\nHe didn't ask you to interfere, did tell you to skip the wedding. It was just a son venting to his mom and seeking comfort, I don't know where you got the idea that this was appropriate or needed.\n\nCole is a grown man, he can handle his feelings, and some day hell find a man who'll love him, but Carlos is not that man and he knows it despite being hurt. It'd be a whole thing if he came out saying he's in love with his sister's fianc\u00e9, but having his mom do it??!? You 1 took that choice away from him (which would've been a shitty choice but at least it would've been his own) and 2 embarrassed him!!!\n\nHow can you not see that you are in the wrong here?\n\nETA: did Cole even mention being upset about the wedding? I read it again and you said he was upset when they started dating (understandable) but made no mention of his feelings now. He could very well be over it and you are creating trouble over nothing and harming everyone in the process", "YTA\n\nFirstly, how was breaking your son's trust doing what was best for him?  \n\nSecondly, how does your son's crush affect you attending your daughter's wedding?   You're punishing them for something out of their control.  \n\nWhat did you expect to happen once they knew?  I can't think of any outcome which would be good.\n\nUnless you're someone who enjoys drama I can't see any reason for you doing what you did.", "YTA but I think we all know who your favorite child is. \n\nAre you actually willing to miss your eldest daughter's wedding... because your precious golden boy had a crush on her soon-to-be husband, 10 years ago?! \n\nCole is right in that you had no right to speak about his feelings with Olivia behind his back. That was his bridge to cross if he ever wanted to (and he would've been an AH if he did, by the way). \n\nThat Cole liked Carlos means NOTHING. That he never made a move means NOTHING. There is nothing to say Carlos would ever reciprocate Cole's feelings (in fact, everything would point toward him rejecting Cole, since he apparently likes women). Olivia did nothing wrong when she started dating him and is doing nothing wrong in marrying him. \n\nYou are sorely wrong and you owe Olivia a huge apology.", "YTA - you haven\u2019t explained at all why you skipping your daughters wedding was \u201cbest\u201d for your son. \n\nHe told you about a crush in confidence. He never asked you to not go to the wedding, and on top of that you betrayed his trust. What\u2019s wrong with you?", "YTA. You attempted to please everyone, and you ended up pleasing no one. And it doesn't seem like Cole is even interested any more. So you really did all this for nothing.", "YTA.  You will not go because your gay son MIGHT be uncomfortable, when it doesn't seem like he is anymore? He had a crush on him almost a decade ago, I am sure he has gotten over that by now, but it seems you have not.", "There has to be another reason, right? No one can be this weird about an 8 year old crush.", "It looks like you got favorites. If i were Olivia, i would have cut the contact with you. You have 3 children, not only 1. Apologize or lose your children for ever. YTA", "YTA. Carlos is straight presumably. Are you suggesting that Carlos should be gay in order to make Cole happy? Or that Olivia should have broken up with Carlos because Cole had a crush on him several years ago? Or that Carlos would have somehow reciprocated if Cole had made the first move? I am lost on what your expectations here were or are.", "YTA I hope one day you can honestly reflect on your actions and what those actions say about you and understand where and how you need to be a better person.", "WTF yeah YTA", "Who needs enemies when you have a mom\u2026YTA", "YTA, why does him dealing with these mean you can't attend? Thats stupid. You should feel bad.", "YTA in every way. Are you even serious right now?", "YTA. Congratulations on losing both your daughter & son in one go", "YTA you are not supporting your son by refusing to attend the wedding of your daughter because your son had a crush on the groom almost a decade ago. In fact, you are just emberassing your son by making a scene over a teenage crush on his best friend. Not to mention, your son is a grown ass adult and can manage his feelings about this situation. You wanted an excuse to make a scene, probably because the attention is on Olivia, and you contrived one. No shit your kids aren't talking to you.", "YTA\n\nWhat? WHAT!?\n\nMa'am. First, that was not your secret to tell. Second, that's not a reason not to go to this wedding! \n\nJust because Cole is sad that his crush married someone else doesn't mean anything. Perhaps Carlos would have turned him down. We'll never know. Maybe Cole is over it by now! Did you even ask? You just caused a serious family situation for no good reason.\n\nIt would be different if Cole had been dating Carlos and Olivia stole him away. That's not what happened. So you doing what is best for your son is not revealing this detail, it's taking to your son about how he's feeling about this and going to your daughter's wedding!\n\nAt this point I'd be surprised if anyone wants you there.", "YTA\n\nIs Cole your favorite child? Or do you normally baby your adult children?  Just about every human being on this planet has experienced a crush that didn't work out and learned to move on like an adult, why is this different?  \n\nEven if Cole was absolutely obsessed with the fiance and had a wall filled with this guy's pictures... You should still go to the wedding!  It's your daughter! Then send Cole to therapy because of his unhealthy attachment! \n\nYou created drama for absolutely no reason and are shocked by how pissed everyone is.", "Big time YTA \n\nI will go a different angle , even if Cole had said he was not going . Why would you punish Carlos and your daughter .\n- it was a crush , they never dated and on top of that he never even acted on the crush \n\nWhy would you even think that him being upset over a crush would be more important than your daughters big day and share in that joy when they did nothing wrong .", "YTA. For all the reasons everyone else already posted", "Did u think by telling her they break up and he would go running to Carlos \n\nWhat a horrid thing to do \n\nGreat why for your kids to go no contact with you \n\nWhy try and destroy your children\u2019s relationship", "I'm glad you're supportive of your son. But it seems like Carlos is straight  and wouldn't be interested in your son anyway.  YTA for deciding that because your son has a crush to not support your daughter on her wedding day.", "YTA\n\nDid you not stop to consider your future son in law is marrying a woman? That even if he and your daughter had never started dating, he being (apparently) on the straight end of the spectrum, would not be interested in dating your son?\n\nThen there's the fact that you obviously and blatantly value one child over the other.\n\nTHEN there's the fact that your son spoke to you in confidence, and you blathered it to EVERYONE?\n\nThree Strikes, you're out.", "YTA\n\nYou have more than one kid. Your son needs to realize Carlos is not straight and he should have moved on years ago. You're punishing your daughter and ruining what should be a special time for her because your son can't grow up and let go of a silly unrequited crush.", "YTA its okay to tell the truth but the conversation with you and Cole was a Mother,Son moment. Cole probably got over it because that his sister and it would be weird to like a brother in law. Carlos and Olivia should invite him because family pictures would be awkward and i think not being at your sisters wedding is worse than your sister marrying your crush that she didn't know of. so yeah TAH-the ashole for sure.", "You won\u2019t attend your daughters wedding because of a crush from almost 10 years ago? How pathetic. YTA.", "Strong YTA. I feel bad for your children for the unneeded stress you\u2019ve probably created around this wedding.", "YTA.. what is best for your son is not going to your daughters wedding and upsetting her? Clear to see that Carlos is the favorite.", "YTA. You caused drama. Learn how to keep a secret. Then learn how to not make something into a bigger thing than it is. Show some respect to all of them. Cole will need to get over it. You should offer him your support instead of almost missing your daughters wedding over a crush your son had. So weird.", "Yo, what is logic you used to not attend your daughters wedding? Did you think you were being a martyr or some saint by not attending?\n\n The issue is with Cole\u2019s feeling for Carlos. That is for Cole to deal with himself. Cole confided in you about his conflict, not to announce it to everyone.\n\nYou need to apologize to everyone. Especially Cole for betraying him and Olivia for causing drama.\n\nThis sound like a poorly writing tv novella\u2026.\n\nYTA, big time.", "YTA\nApologize. How much of an arse can you be?", "YTA for all of this. \n\n1. It was not your tea to spill. \n2. You need to support your daughter who is getting *married* which is a pretty important milestone to just nope out of. \n3. Your son did not ask you to do this. \n4. Your daughter and her fiance are still getting married so it changes nothing on that front. \n5. You've ruined your sons relationship with them both and he could have lost his chance to friends with someone important to the whole family.", "Lord almighty. \n\nSo over **nine** years ago your teenage son admitted to a crush on a heterosexual man who eventually entered a committed relationship with your daughter. \n\nDid I get that right?

That you can't see that is really concerning. :(", "YTA - what about supporting your daughter?? Your son might be hurt, but he needs to move on from a crush a decade ago. Did you ask your son what he needed? Probably just someone to lean on and you betrayed his trust by telling everyone his secrets.", "YTA, wow, you are a terrible mother! Not only did you betray your sons trust you also \nshowed your daughter that he means more to you than she does.", "YTA.  Clearly, Carlos wouldn't have been interested in Cole.  Cole chose not to make the move and now you've violated his privacy by exposing his crush to everyone.  This disaster rests solely with you.  You should have said yes when your daughter first asked you to attend the wedding.\n\nBy the way, you have tons to apologize for.  Seriously, I'd start apologizing now unless you don't want to be included in any more family events.", "INFO: Does Cole still have feelings fir Carlos?", "YTA, he told you that ages ago and you assumed it was still true today. even if it was, you should've gone to your daughter's wedding since that's definitely more important than some crush.", "YTA\n\nIt was none of your business, you should not have revealed a secret that was not yours. Telling your daughter just made everyone uncomfortable. It wasn\u2019t like Cole was dating Carlos. He had a one sided crush.", "YTA\n\nYour son never made his feelings known to Carlos or Olivia. This was not for you to share. Why is Cole more important to you than Olivia? I cannot imagine a mother not attending her daughter's wedding in such a situation.

Oh, also, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA For oh soooo many reasons!", "Olivia and Carlos were dating for 8 years. What have relationships looked like since then?\n\n\nYou say Carlos and Cole were best friends?

Did you spend time with Olivia and Carlos as a couple at all?\n\n\nDo they ever plan on kids? I'm glad you plan on never meeting your grandchildren, because it might remind Cole that they had sex. Your grandchildren would be better off without you.\n\n\n\nAlso, 8 years ago? You say Cole hasn't really dated? Do you have any idea how he feels. At any point in the last 8 years, you could have just been a supportive parent...not pressuring, but asking ONCE if he'd like to talk about that. Maybe he realized he doesn't want a relationship. Maybe he just likes flings that he doesn't tell you about. Or wants to be single. If he does have some hang up about Carlos, then he probably needs therapy to process his emotions.", "YTA.

He will not get what he wants, but it is fine, because Carlos is not the only man in the world.\n\nCole also never even asked you to pick a sude or not attend the wedding. You are offering support he never wanted, and you revealed his secret to boot. And you made it a massive thing. The only time it is right to refuse to attend your child's wedding when you CAN attend?  is if they have done a massive wrong. And Olivia and Carlos have done nothing wrong.  It is incredibly rude to refuse to attend their wedding, especially over a crush they never even knew about.\n\nIf Cole couldnt cope then it would be HIS decision not to go. It forms not involve you, and there is no argument between them so you never had to  pick a side.\n\nI think Cole is your golden child as the baby of the family. Be honest, would you prefer if Carlos was with Cole?  Because it does not look like you support her relationship with him AT ALL.", "YTA  Cole never asked you to pick sides in this and he definitely didn\u2019t give you permission to repeat what he told you in confidence as a 16 year old. He was 16 when his feelings where hurt by Olivia and Carlos getting together. Cole was handling this situation with a lot of grace if Olivia and Carlos had no idea how he felt this whole timeline. You created a problem where there was none because you\u2019re behaving as if your son is not a grown adult who understands how to navigate this situation and who needs you to \u201cmother\u201d him through a crush from 8 years ago. You didn\u2019t even make it clear if Cole still has feelings for Carlos. You only knew that your son liked Carlos back then. You\u2019re wrong, doing too much and damaging relationship between your kids in the process. Now it\u2019s possible that Cole is going to be excluded from the wedding and maybe even Olivia\u2019s life because you can\u2019t shut up. From here on out keep your mouth closed. I would say you need to fix this but I have a feeling things would just end up even worse between them.", "YTA\n\nLady, you hurt all of your children because of nothing but **your** assumptions. And even those proved incorrect. You created a problem out of nothing. And you especially humiliated Cole and betrayed his trust. Yes, you owe everyone a huge apology.", "Yta \n\nGuess everyone now knows who your favourite child is.", "YTA.\n\nYou messed up your daughter's wedding - your daughter who did nothing wrong, btw. You left her hanging for god-knows-why before that.\n\nYou violated your son's confidence. People have crushes that don't pan out. Your son even knows that.\n\nA lot of apologies are in order.", "This is some seriously self righteous crap. Eight years later and Cole isn't over Carlos?! Seriously? Also, is Carlos even into men considering he's marrying your daughter who is a woman? Is it maybe possible that Cole has always been in the wrong here and that he's selfish just as much as you? I mean who is to say if he even made a move eight years ago that Carlos would have obliged? Seems very presumptuous honestly. Why aren't you happy for your daughter? Is Cole happy for his sister? You guys are so selfish..woah! YTA\n\nSorry I edited this because I had mixed up the names.", "YTA, what\u2019s the problem with going to the wedding? Your son will get over it with time, it was a CRUSH.", "YTA. So Cole has a crush, he's not madly in love with Carlos, and it's not like Olivia stole Carlos from Cole so why are you punishing Olivia by not attending her wedding? \n\nBy refusing to go to the wedding you are literally punishing your daughter over something she has no control over. \n\nDid you even ask Cole how he felt about the wedding before you decided he needed to be protected? \n\nAlso how could you, as a mother, refuse to go to your own daughters wedding just because your son has a little crush on the groom? That just shows you clearly favor Cole over Olivia and I'm sure her feelings have been hurt by your actions.", "YTA - You are a horrible parent. I hope you never get to attend any of your kids weddings.", "YTA Hiw could you not go to your child\u2019s wedding when she did nothing wrong?", "YTA. No doubt about it.", "YTA. Seriously? You're going to boycott your daughter's wedding because you son had a crush on her intended groom a decade ago?", "YTA your daughter and Carlos did nothing wrong. I could not imagine skipping my daughters wedding, let alone over something stupid. Your son didn\u2019t ask you to skip it. Not only have you upset your daughter, you betrayed your son. Not sure if you are a horrible parent, sexist or dumb.", "If your son Cole is still upset about having a crush on a man who clearly isn\u2019t gay to the point that you think it\u2019s the right thing to refuse to support your daughter at all in her future marriage, your son is as much an asshole as you are.\n\nIt isn\u2019t like your son was in a relationship with Carlos and then Carlos left him for your daughter. Your son never had any kind of romantic relationship and Carlos nor your daughter did anything wrong in being with each other.\n\nYou understand you are running the risk of permanently alienating your daughter from your life, right? Because choosing not to attend her wedding for this is a huge insult that might break your relationship forever. YTA.", "Yta sheesh. You must do this often huh..stir up random drama for fun cuz your life is just so boring... you're not doing this for your son.  He didn't ask, imply or want you to do this.", "I thought I had missed something when I was reading this because no way in hell could OP think this was a reason to not attend the wedding. Wtf. YTA.", "YTA. You refused to go to your daughters wedding because one of your other kids used to have a crush on their spouse? You don\u2019t play favorites with kids. You really started some shit, you need to fix it. Support your daughter and stop being offended on someone else\u2019s behalf.", "YTA. You're not going to your own daughters wedding because your son has a crush on the groom?! Is your son going? Lol this is so stupid...", "YTA. You caused unnecessary drama among your children. And why wouldn\u2019t you attend your own daughter\u2019s wedding? Why were you choosing sides? They all have the right to be mad at you. You owe them all an apology and it is your duty now to mend everything.", "Yta, wow you really hate Olivia. I hope her new husband\u2019s family loves her and appreciates her because her mom is awful.  I feel so bad for Olivia and kat.", "YTA this one is going on other social media channels. And you are playing favorites. What a painful way to find out your parent doesn't like you. Who doesn't go to their own kids wedding?", "I have no idea what you're trying to convey, but it seems like YTA", "YTA.  You were going to snub your daughter.  Over a crush you son had.  That no one else knew about.  And instead.  You ruined his relationship.  With his sister.  With his future BIL.  And both of you look petty.  And you caused it all.", "Yta", "Ok the only reason I would say you are not the asshole in this situation is if Carlos and Cold had been having sex and then Carlos was dating Olivia. But none of that happened. Right? \n  So I\u2019m sorry this was just a harmless crush, which happens and you are showing blatant favoritism of your son. This is so unfair to your daughter it\u2019s ridiculous.

There's no reason you couldn't have gone to the wedding and just kept the Cole thing on the low. That's your son's thing to deal with. You got yourself into this weird thing then gave away information that wasn't yours to share.", "YTA An honorable apology is in order so your family can move on to the next chapter. Would it really be that difficult?", "Oh no.", "YTA. And so out of touch. Do you even communicate with your children? Clearly not if you think your son is still hung up on a childhood crush. I would rescind that invite if I was your daughter.", "Everytime I see burner / disposable / second reddit account I just assume it's gonna be a YTA. Then I read on to find I'm right.", "You are totally YTA.", "YTA.  If your son had a relationship with Carlos and was ditched in favor of your daughter, you might have a wee leg to stand upon.  I just cannot see any justification for your actions.  Nice way to alienate not one but two of your children.", "YTA on a few different levels. \n\n\u2022 You pretty much told your child that you wouldn\u2019t attend their wedding. You decided to do this for no good reason in particular. Your other child didn\u2019t ask you to do this and even if they did you would still be in the wrong. You were unsupportive of your child\u2019s wedding when they just wanted you to be there. Let that sink in. Your child is getting married and wants to celebrate with you but you decided that no you couldn\u2019t do this for them because of some BS.\n\n\u2022Your other child told you something in confidence. You betrayed that confidence. Which led to your child\u2019s secret being exposed and now your two children are in conflict because of your choices.\n\n\u2022You are completely unrepentant and acting like you\u2019re the victim here.

All you were doing was creating drama for the sake of getting yourself in the center of a whirlwind.

He came out when he was 17 years old and my husband and I are very supportive of him. Cole also revealed to me (before Olivia dated him) that he liked Carlos. He said he had liked him for a long time, but he didn't know how to make the first move. He never made the first move and Olivia and Carlos started dating. Cole was devastated.\n\nHigh odds Carlos wasn't bi. Your son more than likely was barking up the wrong tree, and this is ultimately just a thing that will happen a lot to him if he continues to pine after random dudes in his life without at least first verifying sexual orientation.\n\n>The guys talked to Javier about the situation and he got really angry, but he asked me to come to the wedding and apologize to everyone. I told him that i didn't have to apologize, because i had only done what i thought was best for my son.\n\nYou know, I thought at first this was going to be Cole's doing, but frankly it sounds like while he was upset he was willing to keep it to himself. You, however, outted him on the subject and made it your reason for not going to one of your daughters weddings.\n\nNot only did you more or less confirm that you don't love your daughter terribly much, but you humiliated the person you claim you're doing this for in the first place.

Way to stir up drama for no reason whatsoever. Is Carlos bi? Did Cole really \u201cmiss his chance\u201d or is this a crush that was always doomed to be unrequited?\n\nAlso, Cole needs to get into therapy or something and deal with this fixation on a man that\u2019s been in a committed relationship with his sister for nearly a decade. Move on, dude - that is super unhealthy.\n\nYTA. If you have to hurt your daughter to \u201csupport\u201d your son (which he never even asked you to do) then that\u2019s kind of messed up.

(Even if he decided he liked men, broke up with Olivia then dated your son it would destroy the siblings relationship).\nTHEN to out your sons crush on his friend and fuck with his relationship to both Olivia and his best friend. Yikes. \nI am gay, I don't pine over straight women hoping they will one day change their sexual orientation, I move on.

She asked me why, and I told her that Cole felt really bad, because he still likes Carlos. \n\nCole called me angrily, telling me to mind my own business, that I had no right to tell Olivia about his crush on Carlos, and that i had betrayed his trust, and now Olivia was mad at him too. He didn't give me time to respond and hung up angrily. Kat also called me, and told me that she was very disappointed in me, that Olivia was too, and that now Carlos and Olivia don't know whether to invite Cole or not. \n\nThe guys talked to Javier about the situation and he got really angry, but he asked me to come to the wedding and apologize to everyone. I told him that i didn't have to apologize, because i had only done what i thought was best for my son.  \n\nReddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you take the opportunities over the course of a couple months to just think or, I don't know, maybe talk to Cole? Even if Cole had a problem with it because he had a crush There still ain't no reason to stay away from your daughter's wedding. The appropriate response when your daughter asks you if you could come to her wedding was \"yes dear, it would be my honor. I am so glad to see that you are happy and in love.\" for future reference the appropriate response is not stir up trouble between all the siblings for no apparent reason.", "That is the hands down most moronic train of thought I have ever heard. I cannot believe any of this or that a mother would be so flipping hateful and clueless.", "YTA, and agree.  You had no business revealing your son's old crush.   You never should have said no to your daughter's wedding.", "I feel so bad for Cole. If my mom refused to go to my siblings wedding because of a nearly decade old crush and then told everyone that was the reason I would simply pass away in embarrassment", "Also, life wasn't frozen for 8 years. Did Cole completely stop talking to Carlos? Has OP never had dinner with Olivia and Carlos? No family events?", "We don't know *what* Carlos's orientation is, not that that matters at all here.", "IT WAS 8 OR 9 YEARS AGO WOMAN.", "You are holding onto his crush on Carlos longer than Cole did. Do you not see how that is a problem??", "How is destroying his relationship with his sister and outing his crush on her fianc\u00e9 going to cheer him up? Why would you destroy YOUR relationship with your daughter in order to cheer your son up? Did you really think she wouldn't take offense to you avoiding her wedding because of this?", "You thought this would cheer him up? Hahahahaha", "I really need to know why in sweet flying fuck you would choose to abandon your daughter on the most important day of her life. It cannot simply be to \"cheer up\" Cole, who did not even ask you to do this. What is the *real* reason you would skip your *oldest daughter's wedding*?\n\nChrist, my mom and I have a horrible relationship and even she was desperate to be at my wedding.", "How do you think not attending your daughter's wedding would cheer up your son? How could you even consider not attending your daughter's wedding?", "Why do you care more about Cole than you do Olivia?", "Yikes.", "YTA and a terrible mother", "To cheer up Cole you crap all over your relationship with your daughter? WTF were you thinking? Do you even care about your daughter?", "You're dumb", "Did you ask Cole how he felt about his sister\u2019s relationship/wedding before you decided if attending the wedding would even be an issue? \n\nIt seems like you didn\u2019t. Like you just decided not going would be needed to \u201cshow support for your son.\u201d Who hasn\u2019t even told anyone else about his years-old crush. No offense, but your support seems performative. If it had been sincere, you source checked in with your son to see how he was feeling before even broaching the topic with your daughter. If it wasn\u2019t performative, it was still incredibly thoughtless and unnecessary. YTA. You do need to apologize to your son AND your daughter for creating unnecessary drama. \n\nAlso, why did \u201csupporting\u201d your son mean hurting your daughter? Why would you, as a parent, even consider not going to your daughter\u2019s wedding? Unless there\u2019s some serious bad blood between you two or you\u2019re have a medical issue/disability that would prevent you from going, why would your solution be to not attend?

How did you even think this was an option?", "Yeah. She ruined everyone's relationships for NOTHING.", "I agree that the changes weren't specified or at least made ambiguous, which to me makes it more likely that they've not been changed. If that's correct then the advice might be helpful, if not it'll be ignored as it should be. \n\nAnother reason for using a throwaway is to avoid real-world conversations like \"I can't believe you posted to *reddit*\" and in this case \"See *everyone* think you're TA\".", "This. Her comments reveal that they never talked about it recently and she justvassuned he still had a crush and would not attend.\n\nShe didn't even bother to check in with him, just went straight to destroying her daughter's wedding.", "That's true. But even if he is Bi, Carlos could have made a move on Coke if he was interested. He chose the sister instead. He MADE his choice.\n\nEven if he did like guys, theres nothing to suggest he'd want Cole.  None of us like EVERY single person of the gender/s we are attracted to. \n\nEh, I suspect as the baby that he is the cokgen child, and that especially after he came out and had the unrequited crush she has been unhealthy trying to mother him.", "I said everything would point, precisely because the possibility of him being into other than women is there. \n\nI did not express it as a certainty. \n\nHowever, Carlos was presumably single when he started dating Olivia, and he was not in any way, shape or form in any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with Cole. He chose to date Olivia. He chose her for 9 years. And then chose to marry her. \n\nIn this chain of events, there is pretty much zero reason to believe the story would've been different had Cole made an advance on Carlos a decade ago. He is entitled to entertain that idea, of course. But keeping the crush alive after the guy has been his sister's partner for this long, and OP choosing to miss the wedding in solidarity, is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nBi, straight or anything else in the rainbow that Carlos is, he likes Olivia, loves Olivia, and shares his life with Olivia.", "I\u2019m convinced she wants them to see it to stir the pot even more tbh", "So it doesn't link to their profile. If the kids stumble upon this post, they will know it's mom, but not be able to use it to look at other posts she's made.\n\n\nOr if they know her username, they won't see it by looking at her profile. \n\n\n\nBurners wouldn't be as important in non-recognizable situations. That's the whole point.", "It\u2019s not about keeping them from finding this post, it\u2019s about keeping people who know her from finding the rest of her post history on her main account.

Nothing in you thought maybe he\u2019d moved on!?", "Why are you picking one child over the other? Carlos probably isn't gay or bi and **has been your daughter for 8 years**. You completely disregarded and disrespected her and Carlos' choice to be together for Cole's crush.\n\nHow gross. Being gay isn't a free pass to be homewrecker or interrupt their relationship and marriage. Coles knows that, I hope. You do not.", "Being best friends does not entitle you to a romantic relationship with them.

I assumed that, because i thought he still liked Carlos.", "I was gonna say I know which is the golden child.", "Even if Carlis is bi there is NOTHING to say he would ever have been interested in Cole at all. Not every gay or bi man would want to date Coke or any other guy in particular, just like not every straight man would want a particular woman.", "Either way, it\u2019s safe to assume Carlos loves his potential wife and not Cole which is why this is entire drama is asinine.", "Exactly.  Even if he was Bi it is perfectly possible he never would have dated Cole. Being attracted to men would not mean he would fall for the guy necessarily.  It's not like every heterosexual man I've met has fallen in love with me!\n\nRegardless, he did NOT choose Coke and has made a life with Olivia.", "Evidently not considering she didn't even take Cole's true feeling into account, but assumed he'd be upset and not attend.

All because she made an assumption, and fucking RAN with it", "I think you are right tbh", "You are even more of an asshole for this. You decided to take a stand and hurt your daughter to \"be there\" for your son when he didn't ask, and then told his secret to the only person he was not ready to know.

You are out here making the worst assumptions. Don't assume! Ask!

Why is him liking someone that seems to be straight more important than your daughter loving the man and getting married?  Your daughter didn\u2019t steal Carlos from your son, your daughter did nothing at all wrong!  You are totally the asshole.
