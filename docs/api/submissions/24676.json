You are right, if she doesn't have a stable income, job prospects, or even a place to live on her own, trying to get pregnant on purpose is incredibly selfish.", "NTA, and your mother needs to know what your sister is planning, before she gets pregnant.", "NTA. I wonder how your mom feels about this.", "NTA. Babies aren\u2019t a hobby for people who are bored or a shape to fill a voice in someone\u2019s life. They are humans that require a lot of money, time and care. This decision sounds incredibly immature.", "NTA - *\"I believe she would be a great mom\" -* Well, she is not off to a great start. She is already neglecting what is best for the child, choosing to fufil her own wants and desires instead.", "NTA. As someone who accidentally got pregnant at 18, she\u2019s being a gigantic idiot and completely irresponsible. I was raised in a way that abortion was never an option for me (though I do support it and have had to abort an ectopic pregnancy myself) so I have a 4 year old. \n\nBeing a parent and not financially stable is so freaking bad and if my man and I weren\u2019t as stubborn as we are and willing to make things work, we never would have made it past year 3 (got pregnant after 7 months). Your sister needs to get realistic and realize if she does this she\u2019s likely to wind up as a single mom and she better be prepared in case your mom (rightfully) dumps her on her ass.", "NTA, I think that she is going to have to figure out the whole getting pregnant without a job, finances and who is going to help with the baby especially if your mom is working.  She is stating you would not be a good mom because she is jealous that you know what you want and are going to achieve it and all she wants to do is nothing which even with a baby.  It's going to be just an accessory like a doll.", "There\u2019s a difference between being a parent and being a provider. Although I\u2019m sure that your sister might be a loving mother, she has little means of being able to provide for a child. Before you know it, the baby will be dumped on your parents to financial provide for all of them. If she can\u2019t afford to live on her own with her boyfriend, then she definitely can\u2019t afford to raise a child. NTA", "NTA, she doesn't get it...but don't try to parent her, it seems like your mom needs to chime in here. Your sister has no idea how hard it is to have a child and actually raise that child responsibly. Your mom is not a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds selfish", "NTA\n\nHaving a child is literally the single most selfish thing someone can do.\n\nHow narcissistic, to think that your genes need to live on after you.", "NAH - You certainly aren't wrong for having your concerns.  AT best you might have found a nicer way to have the discussion with her.  Gently led the conversation with you being concerned for her instead of just outright calling her selfish and a burden.  Really loaded language.\n\nBut have you asked her why she and her boyfriend are trying to get pregnant?\n\nI had a friend that got diagnosed with PCOS when she was 19yrs old and the doctor told her that if she wanted any chance of having a baby she needed to start trying immediately because PCOS can cause infertility.  She didn't tell anyone expect her boyfriend about the diagnosis at first, so no one knew why she was suddenly baby crazy.  It still took them four years of actively trying and monitoring her ovulation and everything to get pregnant.  When she started freaking out that she'd never have a baby around year 3 she finally told people what was going on.\n\nSo with that in mind, I'm not willing to judge her T A H either, just in case she has a valid reason to be pushing for this that she hasn't told you about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was waiting for \u201cI had a pregnancy loss and now my sister is trying to have a baby and I want her to wait\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. The reasoning is logical. It is selfish to try and have a child with no means to care for it", "NTA. Does your mom know this??? If not, I would tell her IMMEDIATELY", "NTA.  The minute she becomes a parent, she loses all right to be supported as a dependent child.\n\nShe should be made aware of that immediately.  And so should your mother.", "NTA... warn your mom", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t realize how much time and effort babies take. The financial stuff aside, she needs to take time for herself to be crazy and have fun that way she doesn\u2019t resent her kid for taking that away.", "NTA\n\nIf they wait a couple years, boyfriend will be out of trade school and probably earning a decent job. They can get a small place and have their baby then.", "NTA I don't think your sister is a good mom because she can't financially afford a child, a good parent is someone who can take care of there child physically, financially and emotionally.", "I don\u2019t even think she knows. She told me she\u2019s been trying for two months now & I think that if my mom knew , she\u2019d be extremely unhappy.

We were at lunch having a conversation about my cousin\u2019s new baby who is super adorable. My cousin\u2019s baby is the only baby in the family & my cousin and her baby get mega attention. She started off by saying she wants to have such a cute baby, and then ended with saying that she\u2019s been trying to get pregnant.

She deserves to know.", "And I owe it all to my parents' selfish act!", "Ehhhhhh, I think u/VixenNoire is being almost overly lenient on this. This will sound harsh but I\u2019m from a small trailer park town in the Midwest\u2026. Your sister is insanely young, unemployed, living at home and dating a guy who works part time at Walmart\u2026. I grew up around these people and I\u2019ll eat my shoe if their desire for a baby has anything to do with a medical reason. They\u2019ve gotta get their shit straight first.", "I can imagine you were shocked and just reacted emotionally.  Both of you need a couple days to just cool down.  Then try having a conversation with her that starts with you saying you want to understand what she's feeling and why she's decided now is the right time to try to get pregnant.  Let her talk.  Silence encourages confession.  Once you have all her reasons and emotion, you can gently start picking them apart with logic to show her why she's jumping into something she's not ready for.  Just keep calm and repeating that you are just concerned that X or wonder about Y or worry that Z might happen.  Plant the ideas while still being the sister that's supportive of her feelings, if not of her decision.  You might get further that way then yelling at her and putting her on the defensive.", "Yeah you guys are right, I\u2019m definitely gonna give my mom a call in the morning. I\u2019m worried my mom might threaten to kick her out but the thought of a potential niece/nephew that my mom would have to financially raise is really bothering me.", "lol why are u even continuing the result of ur parent's selfish job ?", "I'm not saying fertility is definitely the reason...I'm just saying it's a possibility and I'm not willing to call any young woman T A H for wanting a baby if she's been told fertility is an issue.  I've known too many people that didn't get diagnosed in time and even getting invitro didn't work.  All I was saying is that there should be a conversation about _why_ the sudden desire to have a baby should happen before the rush to judgement.\n\nIf anything, asking her why gives you the chance to dismantle her reasons and explain why now is not the right time for her to making this decision. Using someone's words against them is often more effective then just telling them how you view their life and choices.  Just coming at her with \"you're being selfish\" is going to make her defensive and make her not listen to anything else being said.  When you want to change someone's mind, you have to know what they are thinking.", "Even if she is kicked out, I think it's better for your sister to be confronted with the very obvious reality that she cannot sustain herself financially NOW rather than when she has a newborn. I know it seems backwards, but you may be protecting your sister from a very hard life by telling your mom. And also protecting an innocent child from being born into a very unstable situation to two emotionally immature parents. She needs a reality check and hard. This is why I'm so fuckin sick of all this fairytale teen mom content on tiktok and ig. It is everywhere now.", "I know it\u2019s not that simple but it\u2019s the right thing to let her know. This at least gives  her the chance to say \u201cMy darling girl, I love you but I can\u2019t support you having a planned child when you cannot take care of it or yourself.\u201d", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Does your mom KNOW your sister is trying to get pregnant? WARN HER.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: \"She got irate and told me she feels like I think she wouldn\u2019t be a good mom.\" ... she wouldn't be a good mom. Part of parenting is actually making sure you have the means to raise your kids - your sister does not.", "NTA bringing a child into that situation *would* make her a bad mom. People in general need to stop pushing the nonsense of \u201clol there\u2019s never a good time to have a baby\u201d and \u201cit\u2019ll work out somehow!\u201d A good time to have a baby is when one is in a stable part of life and have the means to provide the necessities.\n\nSo many people bring children into the world without much thought. She and the boyfriend are only thinking about themselves and not the baby or the others who\u2019ll they\u2019ll surely burden with wanting help. Let your mother know so she can be prepared. She can let your sister know what level of help she can expect with a baby, if any.", "&#x200B;\n\n**You would be a major AH not to warn your mom.**", "Better for her to be kicked out before she is actually pregnant."]}
