We're all in our early 20's and moved in together for convenience of cheaper rent. My bf and I have had some problems with one of our roommates but mostly just kept it to ourselves since we only have a year lease and don't want to cause any problems.\nShe is very messy (leaving dirty dishes in the living room and all over counters for days) and uses most of the space in common areas as her own (ex. Ongoing puzzles taking up all of my dining table for 2 months with her bags and dirty dishes filling the rest of the space, leaving my bf and I to eat dinner in the living room or clean up her mess). \n\n\nAnyways, today she sends a message to our house group chat asking if it's okay that her sister with her five nieces and nephews (all under 10 years old) stay the night this Friday so they can go to a memorial (they live an hour out of the city). She also sends a screenshot of her conversation with her sister where she had already said yes to her. I said \"sure, it doesn't feel as though we have much of a choice though. Would you please ask before saying yes next time?\" To which she replied \"why? Do you have something going on?\" I said \"no it's just a lot to have five children in our little place and we have to keep our 5 month old puppy locked in the bedroom with us the whole time\". Then she asked me if I really would have said no to her family staying for a memorial, and here's where I might have been the ahole, I said \"it's not my family to make sacrifices for and I would have said I'd rather not have them here if you'd asked\u201d.\n\n\nShe did not take that well and said \"well you don't get to make that choice, I pay to live here so if I want them over I can have them over.\" I told her I felt like I wasn't getting any respect from her and that I didn't say no, I just asked for the respect of being asked before she says yes. She then said \"oh my god girl. You don't ask to have your friends over, you just tell me\" (referring to my one friend whose been over a handful of times but always stays in my bedroom with me and has crashed on our couch 3 times) then said \"you have an issue with my sister and her kids every time they come over\". The only time there was ever a problem was when the kids were using my boyfriend and l's dishes and broke a plate (I just asked her if they could use the paper plates or their dishes in the future). I told her that an adult being in my room or crashing on the couch quietly and leaving early in the morning is very different from 5 kids. She just kept asking why and I closed the conversation by saying \"if you can't make an attempt to see my side I'm done talking\". \n\nAm I the ahole?\n\nEDIT; My boyfriend and I are planning to get our own place after this lease is up. She hasn\u2019t done anything to break the lease (no specific number of guests allowed, only a no more than 3 nights consecutively rule) and we plan on staying at on of our parents for the night. I also don\u2019t want to just leave them paying for the place themselves for everyone saying to get out asap but thanks for telling me I am NTA. My bf and I plan to have an actual conversation with her soon about the shared space situation, hopefully it\u2019s not an uncomfortable 8 more months.", "created_utc": 1695878532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u7ayg/aitah_for_telling_my_roommate_that_id_rather_not/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
