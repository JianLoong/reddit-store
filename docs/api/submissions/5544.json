I pay the most rent so I get master bedroom. My roommate cleans the bathroom(poorly) maybe once every couple of months. Usually if his parents are stopping by or something. So it is disgusting. Overflowed trash, dirty shower, and hair everywhere. I've never done more than have a quick glance in passing. If I have guests they only use or see my bathroom so I don't really care. I also keep all dishes and food in my room. I'm not chef so a small fridge/freezer. A few bowls, plates, and cups.  A pot and pan and I'm good.

He never asks me to do the dishes but he'll look at me as I pass them by or bring out my own dishes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's been seeing a girl lately and she stayed over the night before yesterday. For relationship reasons but also because she got snowed in. I guess he made up some lie that his bathroom doesn't work and to knock on my door to shower. So at like midnight she knocked and asked. I told her \"his bathroom is fine.\" I didn't see what happened after that but today he scolded me for \"showing her the bathroom\" and not letting her use mine.

I said \"you've got like three pans\" and pointed to the sink. His girl giggled and he was not happy with that. I think a good portion of his anger is him looking bad in front of a woman. The reason I feel like TA is because she was snowed in so she was kind of forced to use a disgusting bathroom. She only just left this morning. I'm pretty sure they just didn't eat food for a while or ate crackers because he hates doing dishes. At one point he even asked ME to order food to be delivered for everyone. So he wouldn't look like a dick that orders food during a snow storm. He said he'd reimburse me and I said fuck no. I don't feel like TA for him but I feel like in making him deal with his mess.
