This isn't the situation but something that happened in the past was this. He always asked to use my car and I always said no. When I got a new car I got a stick shift car because I liked the car. He saw that as a personal attack against him so he could never possibly drive my car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a master bedroom with a bathroom, a smaller room with no bathroom, and a normal bathroom across from the kitchen. I pay the most rent so I get master bedroom. My roommate cleans the bathroom(poorly) maybe once every couple of months. Usually if his parents are stopping by or something. So it is disgusting. Overflowed trash, dirty shower, and hair everywhere. I've never done more than have a quick glance in passing. If I have guests they only use or see my bathroom so I don't really care. I also keep all dishes and food in my room. I'm not chef so a small fridge/freezer. A few bowls, plates, and cups.  A pot and pan and I'm good. My roommate has more dishes than me actually but never washes them. He never asks me to do the dishes but he'll look at me as I pass them by or bring out my own dishes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's been seeing a girl lately and she stayed over the night before yesterday. For relationship reasons but also because she got snowed in. I guess he made up some lie that his bathroom doesn't work and to knock on my door to shower. So at like midnight she knocked and asked. I told her \"his bathroom is fine.\" I didn't see what happened after that but today he scolded me for \"showing her the bathroom\" and not letting her use mine. Apparently she just decided not to shower. Genuinely feel bad for the time she had to use the bathroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe morning after that day he knocked on my door and asked to use a pan. I said \"you've got like three pans\" and pointed to the sink. His girl giggled and he was not happy with that. I think a good portion of his anger is him looking bad in front of a woman. The reason I feel like TA is because she was snowed in so she was kind of forced to use a disgusting bathroom. She only just left this morning. I'm pretty sure they just didn't eat food for a while or ate crackers because he hates doing dishes. At one point he even asked ME to order food to be delivered for everyone. So he wouldn't look like a dick that orders food during a snow storm. He said he'd reimburse me and I said fuck no. I don't feel like TA for him but I feel like in making him deal with his mess. The girl suffered an uncomfortable experience. Gross bathroom and kinda starved for a bit.", "created_utc": 1671900797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zudok5/aita_for_hiding_not_letting_my_roommate_use_the/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing?\n\nI'm not seeing how you could possibly be TA here. That said, you need to find a better roommate. Him leaving dirty dishes piled up causes problems for you.

If he doesn't have a pan to use because they are dirty, then he can actually try cleaning them.  Same goes for the bathroom - if he embarrassed by how filthy it is - then clean it.

At least, there's that lol", "Cleaning the pan to use for food is like 10 minutes max.\n\nCleaning a gross bathroom to be full clean would be a lot. Cleaning it to be usable would be an hour or 2? With 2 hours you should be able to get the shower, sink, and toilet clean enough to not be gross. Maybe not time to scrub behind the toilet, get all the baseboards, etc etc.", "After pan has been standing unwashed for week and has delicate coating?\n\n\nHahahaha. It is real pain to clean and very possibly coating will be damaged.", "I agree  but if the sink is full  of plates etc it takes a bit to clean them.", "True, gotta buy the right pans for your lifestyle. I love my stainless steel pans that I can leave to soak overnight and scrub as aggressively as I want", "So why is that the other guys fault? Starting to sound like you also never clean your bathroom and blame other......", "It\u2019s the roommate\u2019s fault.
