The only exceptions were my live-in significant other (48m), my sister (34f), who is an advanced practice nurse, and my BIL (40m), who is a physician. I allowed these exceptions because all would, in some way, be involved in my care/advocacy.\n\nI began chemo and radiation in July, which I did for 5 weeks, which means: 5 rounds of chemo, and 25 radiation sessions. Following the 5 weeks, I also required surgery with a 3 day hospital stay out of state.\n\nThroughout the course of my treatment, the aforementioned individuals continually pressured me to tell my parents (70f and 68m), which I refused, and which they respected, for their part.\n\nBut, around the 4th week of treatment, the primarry constituents again pressured me to tell my parents, fearing that we wouldn't be able to keep my illness a secret for much longer.\n\nI should note that, from the start, I did feel bad about excluding them, but for many reasons I don't want to get into here, decided my way was appropriate. After all, it is *my* health status.\n\nNonetheless, I gave in to the pressure and we told my parents. Actually, with my permission, my sister and BIL sat them down and explained everything to them, as I couldn't bear to see their heartbreak in person. They were made aware that they weren't to tell anyone, for any reason, and that the decision to disclose my illness was mine and mine alone.\n\nFast forward to the 5th and 6th weeks of my treatment: parents were extremely supportive, came to my final chemo and radiation appt., watched me ring the bell, and were great. Again, I'm feeling bad I excluded them.\n\nThen, on the third and final day of my out of state hospital stay following my surgical procedure (which was extremely painful, requiring a fentanyl pain pump and strict 72 hour bed rest and other unpleasantries that I won't mention here), I get the following text from my mother:\n\n\"Is it ok for me to let Mrs.Neighbor Lady (who I don't know well or particularly care for) know why I asked her to pray for a special intention?\"\n\nI suspect my mother already told neighbor lady and was asking out of guilt, but I immediately called her - from my hospital bed - and very firmly told her that NO ONE is to know, please stop entertaining these thoughts, don't ask your church friend for some vague \"intention\" and expect her not to be curious, I can't believe you're asking me this as I recover from literal cancer surgery at out of state hospital, etc. My mother cried and agreed not to say anything and we hung up. But I still, to this day, feel bad for how I exploded at her.\n\nPlease no assaults on my/my parents' religion.\n\nSo, AITA for exploding at my mother for not honoring my demands to keep my health status private?\n\nEDIT: at no point did I \"look sick\" (luckily, no hair or weight loss, etc.) and my doctors are optimistic that I will make a complete recovery.", "created_utc": 1667236984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiicp1/aita_for_demanding_privacy_re_my_illnesshealth/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is elderly, and as a parent, she is probably stressed watching her child go through this experience. She probably wanted to try anything and everything to help you. Yes, she might have potentially breached your trust (did you get actual proof though?) and even if she didn't tell anyone, the fact that the thought of sharing your info did cross her mind... and that upset you.
