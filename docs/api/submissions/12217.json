I agreed happily, as I love traveling with my friends. She never mentioned anything about boyfriends coming on the trip so I assumed it would be a girls trip. \n\nI found out a couple months later that the other two girls were bringing their boyfriends, so I automatically assumed that I could bring mine. Out of the 4 of us, 3 are in relationships; one has been for 2 years and me and the other girl have been dating our respective partners for ~4 months. \n\nI casually brought this up to my friend while talking about the trip and mentioned how my boyfriend had found a cheap hotel and she started saying that he wasn\u2019t allowed to come. I was confused and mentioned that the other girls were saying they\u2019d bring their boyfriends, so it must have been a miscommunication. \n\nShe clarified that no, they would be bringing their boyfriends, she just didn\u2019t want me to because she wanted me to spend my time with her there. I asked her why she specifically singled me out and she said it was because I have been with my boyfriend for the least amount of time. I pointed out that the other girl has been with hers for the same amount of time as me, with only a few days difference. \n\nShe insisted that it \u201cwasn\u2019t the same\u201d and that \u201cshe didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my boyfriend coming because she doesn\u2019t know him well\u201d despite not knowing the other girls boyfriend well either. I explained that if something were to happen and we were to break up I\u2019d be happy to go with her alone, but as of right now I was planning on bringing him, as the other girls were. \n\nI told her the way she was treating me wasn\u2019t fair and she kept insisting that I needed to come alone with her because she wanted to spend time with me and share the hotel room with me. I told her we\u2019d never agreed to that and whenever I travel I get my own hotel room, but she kept insisting. \n\nI finally snapped and told her that she was treating me unfairly and that I wasn\u2019t going to go if he didn\u2019t go. She ended up calling me an asshole and now the group is calling me an asshole because I\u2019m \u201cbailing on them\u201d and she\u2019s saying she doesn\u2019t even want to go anymore. \n\nAITA for refusing to travel internationally without my boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1678720258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qcawk/aita_for_refusing_to_take_an_international_trip/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s said \u201cJump\u201d and you\u2019ve agreed to \u201cHow high?\u201d long enough that she can\u2019t adjust to the idea that you are a person able to make their own decisions and have their own priorities. I knew I was a loyal person, liked being a good friend, dependable, empathetic, and I liked the friends that took advantage of those good qualities, because we shared good times, good memories, and they were fun to be around.\n\nThe moment I asserted myself in any small way, I would get the \u201cfuss\u201d that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gone out of your way to avoid. I chose not to go out to the club with a friend (who had her boyfriend coming!) because my grandma had died that day, and I\u2019d been crying for hours. The next day, I was berated for staying home. I left a cookout for an hour (after spending hours there) to pick up new boyfriend with the promise to return and get the cold shoulder for insisting that I *did* want to go get him. And on and on.\n\nAs people get older, I think they get a better sense of what you can and cannot demand from friends. But you\u2019re in a position to start changing the narrative now. Sounds like you are with this \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nHopefully she grows up. Maybe she won\u2019t.", "NTA. But your friend is probably romantically interested in you and this was going to be an attempt to win your heart.", "NTA - she just doesn't want to be odd (wo)man out and so you should come alone since she is alone.  Really simple.  There doesn't always need to be sinister underlying issues.", "When it doesn't make sense sometimes the answer is racism. Is the boyfriend a different race? Or is there something physical that she looks down upon him for?", "Deffo NTA she\u2019s trynna get with you and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re two other friends aren\u2019t in on it.", "Is this the same boyfriend that tried to convince you that you'll learn to 'like' wake-up rape even though you said NO many times? The same boyfriend that took that advice from his mom? \n\nIf so, my judgement rests on your friend's reasoning. I'd suggest that you instead ask your friend why your boyfriend was singled out, not you.", "It sounds like she likes you lol", "I think she just doesn't want to be a 7th wheel and is trying to make OP be another single so they can effectively make up another couple and she won't be alone.", "Many comments are asking the same thing, I'm literally scrolling to see if OP addresses this possibility but so far I haven't seen her answer.", "So for hotels she was actually looking for cheap ones. She has no problem paying her own way - her parents have a decent amount of disposable income and would be more than willing to get her a single room for the trip. That\u2019s why it was so weird to me that she wanted to share rooms. \n\nIf she had a pricier hotel in mind we\u2019d have no problem staying there as well - it\u2019s just a weird situation.", "Him and I both are the same race and we are a different race than her so it shouldn\u2019t be racism.", "Nope that one ended soon after that post.", "Is is possible your friend as more than friendly feelings for you?  Because that would explain why she is fine with the other boyfriends but not yours.  It's also explains why she is insistent to share a room with you (against your wishes, which is concerning) and her wanting to spend one-on-one time together with you as opposed to your other friends.  Because how she was setting it up, it seems like a couples vacation, but with three couples (you and your friend making couple number 3).", "is there any chance she has feelings for you?", "To me it sounds like she didn\u2019t want to be the odd wheel- you were to be her partner on this trip. If that\u2019s the case, she should have been open with you about it so you could decide what you want to do. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "Are the cultural differences? An age discrepancy?", "This again makes me think she was planning on you being her roommate or cost sharer. If you share a room with boyfriend, then who shares with her? She wanted a partner for the trip to share costs like rooming. That\u2019s fine but she needed to communicate that to you upfront so you could decide what YOU wanted. It was her manipulative approach that makes her behavior AHish.", "NTA. It is really weird. And at this point, I don't think it would be fun at all. Even if she gets on board with him going, she\u2019ll make snide remarks the whole trip. Go alone with your boyfriend and ditch the \u201cfriends\u201d altogether", "Then she would not single OP out.", "Really, really glad to hear. You've handled this whole situation with a lot of grace. Until your friend speaks to you about what's going on, you've tried your best to reason with her. \n\nSure maybe it's a crush, but I'm queer too and I would never treat any of my straight/bi friends & their partners as she has you. NTA", "She doesn't. That's why she is trying to force OP to come as a single.", "This is it right here. The controlling little demon \u201cfriend\u201d has a crush on OP, and BF\u2019s presence would rain on her parade.\n\nOP is right not to go. Methinks she and BF should plan a wonderful international trip for just the two of them. Screw the demon \u201cfriend\u201d and her flying monkey travel mates.", "He\u2019s a bit older but within reason; one of the other girl\u2019s boyfriends is the same age. Him and I are both a different race too.", "She might just like OP more. It doesn't mean she has a crush on her.", "I think sometimes we just don't get on with some people. No real reason, just don't mesh for whatever reason.. I had a flatmate like that. She was incredibly nice, never did anything wrong but I could not stand her. I lived with her so it got complicated, i tried hard to be civil but i coukd t always pull it off.. I imagine that's her fear with your SO coming on the trip...\n\nJust saying it might not be logical. She organized the trip so she's saying no, she won't be having a good time if he goes for whatever reason.", "Are you and him from the same race?", "Is there a chance that she is concerned about your relationship/boyfriend\u2019s behavior? That\u2019s my first thought in regards to excluding a new partner. Maybe your friends want to talk to you without him around.", "How many beds are in this hotel room she insists u share?", "Your boyfriend can now take your friend\u2019s place. Problem solved. NTA.", " Naw, your good. Find other friends, they clearly aren\u2019t real people.", "NTA \n\nThis honestly sounds like your friend was planning this as a couples trip; the other 2 hetero couples and then you and her, wanting to share a room, wanting you to spend time with her, \"it's not the same\" when referring to the other couples.  She saw you as the other half of her couple.   Or she was expecting you to pay for her.\n\nAs for the other girls that are giving you a hard time about this, ask them for an explanation as to why they can bring their boyfriends and you can't?   I have a feeling they don't know the full story.", "NTA she wants you alone sharing a room with her, three options, she has a crush on you, she is planning to traffic you, or she is going to attack you", "NTA- trust your gut on this one and the group of friends. You need a new group of friends.", "It's rather odd your friend is insisting that you come alone on this international jaunt. I'd refuse too since her criteria about boyfriends make no sense. NTA.", "Don't ever feel bad cause someone else is mad at you for being you. Control manifests in many benign ways before it gets ugly", "This likely could be a reach, but is your friend secretly (or not so secretly) into you?", "You're NTA. There is something beneath the surface here. But you're not responsible for your friend and should not be expected to be attached to her hip like that.", "NTA and honestly the way these friend groups are going on these international trips and someone ends up dying I would recommend not going at all. Either she\u2019s in love with you or up to no good either way protect your peace!", "NTA.  Your friend is being unreasonable.  BTW, are you sure she isn't secretly in love with you?  Or your boyfriend?", "Have you considered that you were invited alone because your friend didn't want to be the fifth wheel on this trip? The absence of a significant other means she invited a friend as her plus one, which is you.", "I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve talked to my friends about him multiple times and they all seem to like him. He\u2019s very kind and helpful with them as well as me and tends to be a wall flower - he doesn\u2019t really interject his opinion unless it\u2019s about safety (I.e \u201clet\u2019s not walk in the dark it\u2019s not safe let\u2019s drive instead\u201d etc).", "I\u2019m not sure but I\u2019m pretty sure 1. Maybe a pullout couch too?", "Sounds like she was counting on you subsidizing the trip by bringing her costs down as a roomie.", "NTA, this is bizarre. Is it possible it's a money thing? She thought you and she would split the cost of the cabin/hotel? Could she have romantic feelings for either you or your boyfriend?", "I get why people are saying she's into you but I wonder if instead she sees you as a kind of human support animal. You're always the one fetching and scurrying around at her every whim. She's obviously quite comfortable with ordering you about without sparing any attention to your needs. \n\nYou sound tired of this. Your boyfriend also sounds tired of this. I can't imagine how much more tired of this you'll be after being made to fawn on her throughout foreign lands. Ask yourself what you get out of this relationship and whether it's in any way equal to the time and energy she demands of you.", "Yes", "May i ask what race?", "Asian"]}
