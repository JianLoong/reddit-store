I was blown away by the sheer number of responses, and I tried my best to read each one and to respond to as many as possible. Most of the comments said that IWBTA if I didn't at least remind her, and then blow up at her in a \"gotcha\" moment. I completely agreed with that, so I sent her a text as a reminder before school, and followed up with two more face to face reminders after school.\r  \n\r  \nBefore I get to the update, I wanted to add that I did a lot of self reflection as a person and a father based on the comments that I read. Some really stuck out to me as they talked about adhd, discipline, and parenting. I've saved a few to help me keep reflecting and growing as a person. Additionally, I set up an appointment with my daughter's doctor to see if we should be considering an adhd test.\r  \n\r  \nNow for the update. After the third time politely reminding her to see the form yesterday, I asked her if she had signed my name on it already. She said she did. She signed it shortly after I asked her to bring it home for me to sign.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the great perspectives I got from the comments was that forging a parents signature for something this inconsequential isn't really a big deal. Some people disagreed and said forgery is forgery, and that was the perspective I had at the time I made the first post. Not anymore though. She had let me know about the trip and I was ok with her going. Because of my reconsidered perspective I didn't get mad when she told me. I did what many advised me to do and I sat down with her and we talked. We discussed that forgery is a crime, but because she had let me know about the trip and I was ok with her going, that I was ok with what she did. We're not perfect, but we do try our best. My hope is that moving forward with our relationship, I'll try to guide her instead of getting mad. When we spoke last night, I made sure that I spoke calmly and not down to her. I said in a previous comment that I do think she's a good kid. She's got a lot on her plate right now and I'm no longer interested in adding to that.\r  \n\r  \nI really want to thank the vast majority who offered their stories and considerations.

I say this only because girls are much less likely to be diagnosed even though it\u2019s been proven that adhd occurs equally regardless of gender.

One of my favorite kind of UPDATEs because we get to see positive effects on both sides. I think you were fine to communicate that it was okay for her this time, and the reasons why. It will make it a thousand times easier for her to come to you with things more serious than a school form. If she\u2019s anything like me (hello late ADHD diagnosis) understanding and open communication is way more effective than giving out a punishment for the sake of it.

In this example the school would also obviously sue the family for reimbursement... \n\nMy point is that while letting your child fake your signature on a late-for-school slip or some such is mostly benign, take more care when the forgery (which it is!) could have actual repercussions and/or involves third parties.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think she got that from this situation at all lmao.

That original intro of ADHD to the general public has been hard to expand upon. ADHD is commonly diagnosed as depression and/or anxiety in women initially. \n\nOP, girls and women in general are not treated the same by the medical field as a whole. Many women get written off for being dramatic, and symptoms get dismissed. \n\nWhen one doctor couldn't immediately figure out what was wrong with me, he wrote in my chart that my father had molested when I was young, to explain away my problems. My dad never even spanked me, I was still a virgin, and the doctor hadn't even met my dad once. I didn't find this out until later, and I wasn't surprised to learn he wasn't practicing anymore.\n\nThankfully, my mom knew something was wrong with me, and she made sure we figured it out. It took persistence, but doctors eventually found causes for my chronic pain. I don't know where I'd be otherwise. \n\nGood doctors have told me to advocate for myself. You need to prepare yourself to do the same for your daughter. Start reading about ADHD in women so you'll know when to ask questions, or to seek further testing.\n\nTell your daughter to check out the subreddit r/adhdwomen. It's really helped me learn how differently it presents in women. I couldn't believe how much made sense afterwards. \n\nYou've already shown you're open to change from you original post, and you handled the paperwork problem wonderfully.

I practiced his signature for ages in order to get it right and even gave some of my attempts to him to critique. The deal was that as long as I told him, I could sign for him. He trusted me and I never gave him reason not to. Made life easier for everyone.

The range of acceptable behavior for girls is much narrower than for boys, and when boys deviate from that range in ways consistent with ADHD or autism (for which masking is even more common) they are more likely to be assessed than to be written off as a problem child (especially since almost all ADHD and autism research is focused on boys and they manifest quite differently in girls--even professionals often have no idea what to look for in girls). As a result, instead of these things being recognized and resources being provided to help them navigate a world that isn't built for their type of brain, they are demeaned, punished, etc. until they build (often harmful) coping mechanisms just to make it through the day and avoid the negative feedback loop, as a result it becomes harder to identify the condition because its properties are camouflaged. \n\nPlenty of boys do go through life undiagnosed and unconsciously learning to mask (I'm in my 30's and only just now was referred for an assessment, for example--but then again I have a set of symptoms more common in women and less common in men, so I suppose in a way I do fit the pattern I described above), and plenty girls get diagnosed early and are given appropriate resources, but as a broad pattern those are exceptions.", "but i wouldn\u2019t lie just to provide an example to support this person? idk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f like if im saying i haven\u2019t and would never forge a signature on an actual important document that\u2019s not a 10th grade movie slip then i mean it \ud83d\udc80 writing my parents name WITH THEIR APPROVAL for something INSIGNIFICANT is literally not enough to make me or ANY kid (teen) suddenly think that lying and cheating and all kinds of bad things are okay. \ud83d\ude02 and that\u2019s the point.", "LOL ok fair that you don\u2019t know me but I\u2019m just saying.", "I got lucky that my mom advocated for me.
