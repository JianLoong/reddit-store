I was blown away by the sheer number of responses, and I tried my best to read each one and to respond to as many as possible. Most of the comments said that IWBTA if I didn't at least remind her, and then blow up at her in a \"gotcha\" moment. I completely agreed with that, so I sent her a text as a reminder before school, and followed up with two more face to face reminders after school.\r  \n\r  \nBefore I get to the update, I wanted to add that I did a lot of self reflection as a person and a father based on the comments that I read. Some really stuck out to me as they talked about adhd, discipline, and parenting. I've saved a few to help me keep reflecting and growing as a person. Additionally, I set up an appointment with my daughter's doctor to see if we should be considering an adhd test.\r  \n\r  \nNow for the update. After the third time politely reminding her to see the form yesterday, I asked her if she had signed my name on it already. She said she did. She signed it shortly after I asked her to bring it home for me to sign.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the great perspectives I got from the comments was that forging a parents signature for something this inconsequential isn't really a big deal. Some people disagreed and said forgery is forgery, and that was the perspective I had at the time I made the first post. Not anymore though. She had let me know about the trip and I was ok with her going. Because of my reconsidered perspective I didn't get mad when she told me. I did what many advised me to do and I sat down with her and we talked. We discussed that forgery is a crime, but because she had let me know about the trip and I was ok with her going, that I was ok with what she did. We're not perfect, but we do try our best. My hope is that moving forward with our relationship, I'll try to guide her instead of getting mad. When we spoke last night, I made sure that I spoke calmly and not down to her. I said in a previous comment that I do think she's a good kid. She's got a lot on her plate right now and I'm no longer interested in adding to that.\r  \n\r  \nI really want to thank the vast majority who offered their stories and considerations. One person questioned why I would even make this post, but I'm really glad I did.", "created_utc": 1700080048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w2vl5/update_wibta_if_i_grounded_my_daughter_for/", "score": 785, "replies": ["The only suggestion I have is that, rather than telling her you are okay with what she did, tell her that the decision disappointed you, but that you understand why she did it.

Communication and understanding are key in building a healthy parent-child relationship. Kudos to you for being open-minded and willing to evolve as a parent. Keep up the good work!", "I didn't comment on your first post, but this is what I thought at the time:\n\nMy now-33-year-old brother admitted, laughing, at a family dinner recently that he'd forged my parents' signature on basically everything during high school.  *I* wasn't surprised, but my parents were, and were actually kind of upset.\n\nDidn't say anything out loud, but internally I was like...he *barely* graduated and you were aware of the crippling mental illness and drug/alcohol use (none of which has changed), but *this* retroactively bothers you?\n\nIf your kid's otherwise doing okay and forged your signature mostly to cover her own absentmindedness, I sure wouldn't sweat it much.  There are so many things that a busy high schooler has to take care of, it's easy to let the little things slip.  Glad y'all worked it out in a calm and respectful manner.", "ADHD-er here - I\u2019d highly recommend researching adhd and it\u2019s symptoms and going through them with your daughter BEFORE going to a doctor. I say this only because girls are much less likely to be diagnosed even though it\u2019s been proven that adhd occurs equally regardless of gender. Having an accurate list of symptoms so your daughter doesn\u2019t have to think of specific things in the moment will help a ton with getting an accurate assessment.", "HELL YEAH DUDE", "I think you did a near perfect job here.  \u2b50\ufe0f", "Thank you for listening and taking your concerns to a doctor. If they don\u2019t seem knowledgeable about adhd in girls/women specifically (different symptoms and expression), they may refer your daughter to a specialist. \n\nIf she is indeed diagnosed with adhd, I think you\u2019ll find that a diagnosis at a younger age brings a change to your parenting that is beneficial in the long run. IMO the best thing you can do right now is to be on her side.", "Great job on the self-reflection, OP. Many people aren't strong enough to do that. Transitioning from being a parent of a child to a parent of an adult is tough. Keep up the hard work!", "Now these are the updates I love to see \ud83e\udd70 it really sounds like you have an open mind about a lot of the concerns raised, and towards a lot of the suggestions.

One of my favorite kind of UPDATEs because we get to see positive effects on both sides. I think you were fine to communicate that it was okay for her this time, and the reasons why. It will make it a thousand times easier for her to come to you with things more serious than a school form. If she\u2019s anything like me (hello late ADHD diagnosis) understanding and open communication is way more effective than giving out a punishment for the sake of it. Thanks for sharing!", "I am not a lawyer, but. Forging a signature in of itself is not a crime. If there is no intent to defraud, there is no crime.", "As someone who had a difficult childhood, I thought your post was sweet. I love seeing posts of parents trying to parent. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and who knows how to raise a full human when you\u2019ve never done it before lol. Seeing people go out of their way on Reddit to look for advice, try, learn, and take constructive criticism make my heart melt.  A parent who tries is always a good one imo", "\"She's got a lot on her plate right now and I'm no longer interested in adding to that.\"\n\nthis is really wonderful to read thanks for sharing", "This update makes me so happy ! You did a great job OP.\n\nYou're building trust with your kid, and that's a good thing as a parent. That's the kind of exchange that will stick when she'll have to pick between trusting you to care more about her wellbeing than about being right/getting mad.", "It\u2019s so good to see reflection!\n\nI do think it\u2019s fine to express dislike of or disappointment in an action without anger or condemning the person.\n\nI think people think firm needs to be angry when that isn\u2019t the case. I am always the fun adult, but I have clear rules. It can be both, but so good to not set traps! Those are such a breech of trust.", "This is a really good update. Thank you for sharing.", "That's a good update", "I only lurked on your previous post, but this update makes me really happy.

It sounds like you're a really good dad.", "That's great and all, but personally,  if my kid forged my signature on something as dumb as a field trip permission slip, I'd wonder what *else* isn't making it home to be signed.", "I saw the original post, and I think you set a boundary that she disregarded. She knows she can forge your signature for something more important later. \n\nI'm not saying ground her now, but warn her there will be consequences in the future.", "How do you know she didn\u2019t leave off portions of the permission slip, like an entire second page, etc?", "> We discussed that forgery is a crime, but because she had let me know about the trip and I was ok with her going, that I was ok with what she did.

Lol", "Good reflection, but you went the wrong way. Forgery is forgery, that's that.", "If she gets hurt, lost, or in trouble on a school trip with a forged signature, you can and will have a lot of problems. Any and all liability for any issue on the trip will be on your daughter and you. On future trips even if it is your signature it can be argued that it is forged due to the actions of your daughter. This may seem simple in many peoples eyes, but in the eyes of the legal word, her actions will negate any obligations or responsibilities of the school, transportation or insurance to your child on the trip.", "NTA but suggest that you explain what forgery is, and maybe find a case or two of local crimes in an online newspaper, and how people have gone to prison for forgery related crimes.  On a spectrum of forgery injury and damages, a school permission is way on the minor side. But she needs to understand what the consequences could be if she signed one of your checks, or used one of your credit cards and signed for it without your permission.  It sounds like you could do this in a calm but concerned manner.", "She forged your signature. You telling her that you were okay with it will lead her to doing many times and NOT telling you about.

We can always be better", "your nta but if you continue to let her, it becomes", "Yeah honestly it's not the forgery itself I have an issue with, it's that she was told not to do it and then did it anyway.

I got grounded and spanked \ud83d\ude2d all because I forged my mom\u2019s signature to go on a field trip.", "Yep. My brother was diagnosed and my dad likely had it but never would have gone to the doctor for mental health. I tried to get diagnosed at 25 and had a horrible experience. The psychiatrist told me I had passive aggressive personality disorder (not even recognized in the current DSM), insinuating my symptoms were deliberate and I just needed therapy for my shitty personality essentially lol. It took me seeing a therapist for a few years before I had the courage to try again, and I got diagnosed this year at 28.", "So much this! I finally was diagnosed in my early 40's after my son got diagnosed. I was filling out the form for him and so much clicked! We are taught to mask and girls don't tend to have the same behavior traits as boys for ADHD diagnosis.", "Also, girls/women are more likely to have the inattentive type, which is a problem when a lot of professionals are looking more for the hyperactive type.", "Could you explain this more? How are they trained to mask it?", "Yeah, I was diagnosed a year ago at age 37...", "This is obviously going to vary *wildly* with jurisdiction, but note that while in this instance the parent is not being defrauded it could be argued that the school is being defrauded, i.e. making it a crime. \n\nSay for example that - God forbid - that OP:s daughter had an accident on the trip and the school insurance company for some reason realized the permission form for the trip was a forgery, they could refuse payment and settle the school with all costs = the school has been defrauded. In this example the school would also obviously sue the family for reimbursement... \n\nMy point is that while letting your child fake your signature on a late-for-school slip or some such is mostly benign, take more care when the forgery (which it is!) could have actual repercussions and/or involves third parties.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think she got that from this situation at all lmao. There isn\u2019t a form she will have access to herself that she can forge that is \u201cmore important\u201d. The only slips students get like this are for field trips.

It\u2019s not like she\u2019s forging to open up a new bank account or credit card in OPs name. Not forging OPs signature to sign over the house to her.

Man, my life got *so much easier* after that.", "ADHD studies usually focused on boys, especially when meds like Ritalin were coming out. That original intro of ADHD to the general public has been hard to expand upon. ADHD is commonly diagnosed as depression and/or anxiety in women initially. \n\nOP, girls and women in general are not treated the same by the medical field as a whole. Many women get written off for being dramatic, and symptoms get dismissed. \n\nWhen one doctor couldn't immediately figure out what was wrong with me, he wrote in my chart that my father had molested when I was young, to explain away my problems. My dad never even spanked me, I was still a virgin, and the doctor hadn't even met my dad once. I didn't find this out until later, and I wasn't surprised to learn he wasn't practicing anymore.\n\nThankfully, my mom knew something was wrong with me, and she made sure we figured it out. It took persistence, but doctors eventually found causes for my chronic pain. I don't know where I'd be otherwise. \n\nGood doctors have told me to advocate for myself. You need to prepare yourself to do the same for your daughter. Start reading about ADHD in women so you'll know when to ask questions, or to seek further testing.\n\nTell your daughter to check out the subreddit r/adhdwomen. It's really helped me learn how differently it presents in women. I couldn't believe how much made sense afterwards. \n\nYou've already shown you're open to change from you original post, and you handled the paperwork problem wonderfully. Keep communicating with your daughter. If she feels she can talk openly with you, you'll be setting both of you up for a great relationship for years to come.", "I'm really lucky in that I had some other executive function issues that were flagged when I was a child (I'm in my 40s as well) so I was diagnosed at a time when girls rarely were BUT when my kid got a diagnosis of AuHD and a lot of the behavior they flagged on the spectrum as opposed to ADHD was exactly like me a lot clicked.", "I\u2019m almost 39 and I had no idea that my ADHD was \u201cabnormal\u201d from other people.

Now that I have kids, it\u2019s manifested as anxiety and it wasn\u2019t until I started seeing a therapist that we realized that the anxiety was created from my inability to \u201clife hack\u201d other people bc of my ADHD.  So when I started seeing ADHD videos and talking to my therapist, I realized that what I was doing wasn\u2019t typical for people my age. \n\nMy husband has ADHD as well.
