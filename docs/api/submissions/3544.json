Very well done ( and brave) you.\n\nSomeone called out my parenting skills once.  My four kids were under 10, and all ADHD. It was exhausting.  While at a Dr appointment for the older three, my youngest toddler kept getting away from me in the waiting room. I kept calling him back, with mixed success.  I was super tired that day.  One of the doctors passing through the waiting room looked at me and said \u201cgo and get your child\u201d. I was so embarrassed and so angry. I remember muttering about it all the way home, feeling thoroughly wronged. \n\nBut he was right, and I knew it. From that time onward, if my kid wasn\u2019t where s/he should be, I called to them and instantly got up to get them.  Home and away. It didn\u2019t take long for my kids to learn that I meant what I said and they became much more responsive / obedient. Which also meant I could trust them more and correct / nag less. Everyone won. \n\nAs a funny side note, at some point, I introduced a loud finger snap when I called, so my kids developed a Pavlovian response to the snap. I could just snap, and it would stop them in their tracks even as teenagers.  At one point in on a road trip when they were older, we\u2019d stopped to get fast food.  Lots of trays involved for a family our size. When the food was ready, I made my habitual snap, and my kids jumped up from the table where they\u2019d been talking and laughing while waiting.  They filed up to the counter in chronological order, grabbed the cups and filled the drinks while husband and I got the food to the table.  They helped each other at the drinks machine, didn\u2019t make a mess, and brought drinks back for husband and me, as well as their own. This guy who\u2019d been in line behind me, turned (astounded at the silent choreography) and asked \u201chow did you DO that?!\u201d  I stood there wondering how the heck my rowdy crew had suddenly become a scene from \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d, and my oldest piped up, smiling, \u201cshe just does that, we know what she means\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for that mean doctor who corrected me publicly.

I then ran after the middle child, not seeing my oldest jump in front of the carrier acting like spiderman towards the picture. The receptionist literally spit her soda out at the computer laughing so hard and then asked me if I trained him to do that.
