I don't know, but am assuming he was probably pretty angry on the phone and not being calm/reasonable. \n\nThe full refund option was fair, but at the end of the day, the buyer didn't want to make the drive and wanted to keep the tent.

He already had to pay for gas to pick up the tent and now you're asking him to pay even more in gas to drive to you and return it. The only way that it's a full refund is if you also add in the fuel costs he incurred by making two round trips. Even then, you really should also be compensating him for the time it took.

The guy also already bought it for 50% of what OP paid for it so it was already heavily discounted for only 1 use. Asking for gas money is not ok"]}
