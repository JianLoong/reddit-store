(Buyer absolutely should have checked at pick up)", "NTA\n\nThis was a second hand item he got for half price...", "NTA. If you go to a store and buy something you get to return it and get your money back. They don\u2019t pay for gas either. Some places will offer a discount if item is wrong but not all do or are required to do.", "NTA. Sounds like a classic Facebook scammer move", "NTA. I\u2019ve had to return so many faulty or defective items to stores. Do you think I march up to the cashier and demand they reimburse me for the gas I used to get to the store? No. Shit happens. It\u2019s part of being a consumer.", "YTA, you advertised a larger product than you sold. You owe him compensation for your screw up. He's being pretty dang reasonable about it too while you are acting like a swindler and a crook", "YTA. You listed incorrect info on the listing, which even by accident, was false advertising. It actually is unfair that you expect the other person to make all the effort to return the item, while you get to \u201cspend time with your family\u201d, when you were the one in the wrong. Refunding $75 is probably too much for 1 meter, but you could have tried to find some kind of compromise instead acting like the victim that he was rightfully angry about the specs being wrong.", "I actually think giving him $40 is fair. He got about 20% less in square meters than was advertised. $40 would be 20% of the price he paid. Do you really want to keep dealing with this over $40? \n\nPlus, if he reports it to FB, you'll have more to deal with. Also, do you really want him at your home to return it?", "YTA just give him the $40, it's your fault and a 20% discount is appropriate", "YTA. It's your mistake, not his. If you don't want to give him money, go pick it up and give his money back; he shouldn't have to take his time to return it, either. And last time I ordered an item and got the wrong thing from a store, they refunded my money and let me keep it, so your comparison there is ridiculous. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA - as the seller it\u2019s your responsibility to provide accurate representation of the product you are selling. You didn\u2019t hold up your end of the bargain, and inconveniencing him to drive it back to you is unfair. I would have sent him the money he requested and called it a day. This was your screw up, and you are the one who should be inconvenienced to fix it.", "YTA, try to put yourself in his situation. Sounds like he was coming up with reasonable and fair solutions to your mistake and you were an unfair dick about it.", "ESH\n\nthe OP accidentally stated the wrong description of the product. When you buy used products on Facebook or Craigslist for example, it is up to the buyer to inspect the product before leaving it. OP is an ass for being difficult about the return but the buyer is an ass for demanding a refund when they clearly didn\u2019t inspect the product upon pickup", "I\u2019ll say NTA because you offered a full refund. If you go to Walmart and they give you the wrong item, they will refund you but they aren\u2019t going to pay for your gas or let you keep the item but pay you a little extra. \n\nBut ethically and practically, if he offers you a reasonable amount like $20 or $40, just give it to him. That\u2019s easier for everyone than you trying to waste your time and money talking back a tent and finding a new seller. \n\nYou are just being dumb and annoying", "YTA. Just give them the $40.", "YTA. There\u2019s no way you could think you\u2019re in the right here. You want him to just keep losing money to pay for your mistake. You had a contract. You breached the contract. It\u2019s your job to make things right and put him back in the position he was in before you made the contract in the first place, or to settle the matter in a way that\u2019s mutually agreeable. You could just send him $40 and he would take it. You\u2019re being completely unreasonable!", "So if you bought a pair of $800 Louboutin shoes off of me, size 37. You paid $400, but you got them home and they were a size 35 so they don't fit.. You can't use them! Is that still a good deal?", "Interesting take on defrauding.", "That\u2019s what I figured at first, but all the comments really got me second guessing that decision. As i wrote, if he drove several 100 miles, should I compensate that? How am I to know if he drives so far for his purchase?", "But he didn\u2019t buy it on Amazon, he bought it 50% cheaper in a peer to peer purchase. And then wanted an additional 20% off. Just didn\u2019t figure that was fair.", "Yeah, maybe. If I had made a similar deal and the buyer proceeded to harass me that way I'd tell him stuff it. The guy clearly didn't find the tent useless and got a good deal regardless.", "Idk wth happened here, but I'm with you on this. If im remembering correctly, you said you paid $400 for it and only wanted $200 for it after only using it once...? That's more than fair. Even if you had the wrong size. You're selling it for half of what you paid. And no, you don't owe him gas money if he wants to return it.", "Not a valid comparison. The buyer clearly was ok keeping the tent and would likely get good use out of it. Also, when is the last time you bought shoes without trying them on. A 4m x 8m tent is a little harder to test but still could have been looked over. It wasn't an online sale", "exactly. This was not an online sale. Guy went and got it. Um... maybe look it over?? sheesh", "THat's a big assumption. He sold it under false pretenses how? He bought it, never used it and sold it for half price. He offered to refund the guy. He was basically harassed over an honest discrepancy.", "I never pay shipping on Amazon. Purchase or return", "Wait when have a store ever given a refund and said \u201cyep just keep the product and here\u2019s your money\u201d? That isn\u2019t how things work lol", "I agree, NTA  the buyer could have looked it over at time of purchase, it was new? no labels or anything? I mean come on. Guy got a Deal regardless. Maybe I'm an AH too but someone harassing me over $40 on a $400 value item they paid half for I'd tell them stuff it too", "THere is no such ting as free. When you purchase on Amazon for example, the cost of shipping is factored into the price. If you buy the same item on Ebay, its less before the cost of shipping. Basic commerce. The retailer builds all the associated costs into the sale price and then gives you \"free\" shipping", "Buying of facebook is purchasing it online. I mean YTA in this whole thing but you cannot be on Facebook unless you're online, so yes he bought it online.", "People using analogies of what big-box online retailers would do, it's weird. Obviously has nothing to do with the legal situation and what you did was absolutely the right way to go about it from a legal perspective.", "I\u2019ve had that happen with a few items on Amazon and Temu", "And if you return it you get 100% of the cost back, including the included shipping cost.", "Which is their service to get you to come back to amazon. Relatively cheap and a good way for them to retain customers. That doesn't mean they'd have to.", "NTA thats the price of buying second hand on craigslist or similar sites, sometimes you don\u2019t get what you thought you were getting", "Buyer beware, you ALWAYS measure before.  Especially if driving.\n\nIf was a store you wouldn\u2019t get gas back, they\u2019re lucky willing to take it back", "I feel like this is a whole lot of drama over $40.", "The tent you sold him was 20% smaller than what you claimed it was. $40 off on a $200 sale is exactly that. He's not even asking you to compensate for the inconvenience. You didn't bother to write accurate information and now you refuse to be held accountable. Don't be surprised if he returns your tent with piss in it.\nYTA", "YTA. His demand was fair.", "YTA you got the size wrong then refused to take ten minutes to do some research and negotiate with the buyer.", "YTA\n\nJust offer him to ship it back to you on your dime.", "YTA.", "You are a scammer. YTA", "This is weird. I sell stuff on the marketplace all the time. Whomever buys always checks. I mean I would a bed frame. The person measured it because I took it about and brought it downstairs. I didn\u2019t want them in my apartment. He measured it in the lobby. I wasn\u2019t offended. He paid me and left.\nWhen you buy used, you check it. Just like if you buy a used car, you check it before driving away. Or bring someone that knows cars.", "NTA, return it for a full refund which is what you offered.  I assume he can still use it that's why he's offering to keep it for a partial refund.  I'll see you on judge Judy in a few months", "NTA - you are not a retailer, buying from a private person is higher risk and you do not have the same rights as if you buy from a store (at least not in most European countries). Mistakes happen. You offered him to bring it back and get all his money back as well. \n\nThe size of the tent is not an issue for him, if it was he would have returned the tent and got his money back, he just wants a cheaper tent.", "NTA. Items on FB marketplace are sold \u201cas is\u201d, so buyer isn\u2019t entitled to anything here.", "Yea I have a few thoughts\u20261) maybe the buyer is scamming the seller. Claiming it\u2019s a meter leas when actually it is the correct size. 2) anytime I buy something second hand online I check it out when I pick it up. The buyer should have inspected the tent before taking it home. 3) anytime you buy something online chances are if you return it you have to use your own gas and sometimes printer/ink/paper and packaging to send it back. \n\nIdk. I think this was either a scam on the buyers end to get some money back or an innocent mistake by the seller. People are being very harsh. I\u2019m going to go with a soft NTA but maybe just not the savviest seller lol", "I agree, I can be stubborn. Admittedly. \nBut i didn\u2019t want to be bullied into giving a even bigger discount, when it was already pretty big. \nAnd I did check market prices afterwards. He did get a great deal still. \nI could just sell it to someone else.", "I can accept to be in the wrong of my judgment, but I\u2019m not a scammer.", "If you were returning the item because you didn't like it, or it happened to be defective through no fault of the store, yes. But if the store falsely advertised a 5x8 meter tent as a 4x8 meter tent, you should ideally be able to get them to reimburse the cost of gas. The principle at the heart of all civil/tort law is that if a person's negligence or bad faith actions have caused you harm, they have to \"make you whole\" i.e. reimburse all your costs so you aren't at a net loss.\n\nNow, whether you'd actually take a store to small claims court over this is a separate issue largely due to the practicality of it (although if a store is falsely advertising an item, others would be affected too, and it could actually become a case) but, in principle, the store should make you whole.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you look at the size before taking them home? Or if you had them shipped, why wouldn\u2019t you be smarter and get some insurance when spending that amount of money?", "In this situation, you were a scammer. \u201eWere\u201d because you accept to be wrong and I suspect you will give him some of his money back or pay for the transportation", "Copenhagen is in Denmark and here that is not a thing.", "are you swedish by any chance", "You can actually mail returns to stores and they\u2019ll give you free shipping. Why can\u2019t he ship it back to you and you pay for the shipping and give him a full refund??", "Was Target falsely advertising the product? That's the difference here. If the customer simply didn't like the product, that'd be a separate case.", "No. Danish", "Amazon and Temu aren\u2019t retail stores like Target.", "Whats legal and whats right are often two very different things"]}
