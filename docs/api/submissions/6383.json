And despite what you may have led yourself to believe, you absolutely ARE trying to force your son into a relationship with his ex. \n\nIn late high school/early college I was dating a girl who was also close with my mom. We broke up but my mom stayed close with her. Every time I saw my mom she would give me updates on my ex.

Like you, she wanted us to get back together. It got to the point where I actively avoided my mom for a long time because I didn't want to keep having the same conversation about my ex over and over again. Your son is going through the same thing, except he has the added complication of his sexuality, which you clearly won't accept. \n\nPiece of advice for you, OP: you're dangerously close to destroying your relationship with your son. If you haven't already, you're starting to make him feel ashamed of his sexuality and like you won't accept him for liking me. If you keep up the way you're going he's going to start avoiding contact with you and finding ways to cut you out of his life. If you want to maintain and repair the relationship with him then drop your obsession with him getting back with his ex. Accept him for who he is and let him live his life however he wants.
