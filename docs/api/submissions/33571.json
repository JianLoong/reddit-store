{"id": 33571, "submission_id": "18ok7by", "title": "AITA for wanting my family here after baby is born but not my in-laws?", "selftext": "\nDuring the birth of my first child only\nmy mom and husband were present in delivery room. The in-laws visited eight weeks later once I was mostly healed and the baby was bigger. However, this visit turned stressful quickly with my father in law, mother in law, and brother in law making rude comments about my weight, appearance, and not helping with any tasks around the house. This left me really anxious and upset for a long time. (And no, husband did not stand up for me at the time but has since apologized and promised it won\u2019t happen again) \n\nFor the arrival of my second child I planned for my mom (who lives with us part time as a snow bird) to care for our current child. Meanwhile my bestfriend (who\u2019s basically my sister) would fly out and be in the delivery room and help afterwards while I recover. My bestfriend is a pediatric nurse, and would be a huge advocate for me during delivery. She also is a huge help around the house (even when I didn\u2019t have a new baby.) \n\nConflict comes because my in-laws are already requesting to come fly out and visit the baby within a month of birth. I declined saying reasoning would be the baby\u2019s immune system wouldn\u2019t be fully functional until 6 weeks minimum. I\u2019m fully aware this is only half the reasoning, the other half being the past issues, but I wanted to avoid conflict and used this as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to not fight over how they treated me last time. \n\nNow, my husband is upset stating that even my bestfriend shouldn\u2019t fly out since the baby\u2019s immune system isn\u2019t fully built (same reasoning I said to my mother in law) \n\nI feel torn. I very badly want my bestfriend there to support me, but I really don\u2019t want the stress of visitors so soon after birth, especially when I\u2019ll be expected to entertain them. I also don\u2019t trust in-laws to be as \u201cgerm conscious\u201d as my nurse best friend. \n\nShould I just permit my in-laws to come and suck it up for support and help my best friend will provide? Please help.\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\nThere are two reasons I do not want the in-laws around immediately. First IS health and immunity being a concern, (which wasn\u2019t an issue first time since they waited 8 weeks to visit) however, I trust my friend (a pediatric nurse) to take appropriate precautions. I do not trust the in laws to wash hands, not kiss baby on the face, be vaccinated for whooping cough (which friend is due to nature of her job) etc. \n\nThe second reason is past experiences. I only expressed my first reason to mother in law because I did not feel like fighting about the past again.

Explain to your SO that the *last* time his family came down, they *didn't* help, they were *rude*, they shit talked *to* you and *about* you. So if he's so insistent on having them there, then you and kids will leave for the duration and maybe he can utilize that time to teach his family some manners.\n\nI mean, who in the world would think it's a really good idea to make fun of a woman's weight when she *just* gave birth? Or any time, really. But especially not right after birth. And shame on his mother because she had experienced that at least twice in her life, if not more, and would know first hand all of the emotions and hormones. \n\nAnd shame shame shame on your SO for allowing it to happen in the first place.", "NTA. Tell your husband the full reasons for not wanting your in laws to come, and then potentially you and him can also tell them. You should tell them that the reason other people can come and they can't is because your mom and best friend were supportive and helpful last time, and they were not.\n\nNow, maybe how your in laws behaved the first time isn't indicative of who they really are. If they apologize and promise to do better this time, you can *consider* having them come within the month. But you are NOT obligated to. It is a huge privilege to stay in the home of new parents with a newborn baby, they are not entitled to that privilege, and if they are given it, they need to be respectful and helpful to the new parents!", "Tell them the truth. They cannot come because they were rude and stressed you out.  You can use ChatGPT to help you word it, but that\u2019s the gist of it, no. \n\nThey don\u2019t live next door, who cares if they\u2019re mad. They can be mad wherever they are that\u2019s far away from you.", ">my father in law, mother in law, and brother in law making rude comments about my weight, appearance, and not helping with any tasks around the house.\n\nNTA. I would understand if you didn't want them around *ever*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>my husband is upset\n\nToo bad; he promised it wouldn't happen again and didn't stand up to them last time. So not having them there this time will ensure it won't happen again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelpful people you want there, can be there; unhelpful, stressful, and rude in-laws can't.", "NTA.  You know how your husband apologized and said that it wouldn\u2019t happen again after the disaster that was his family\u2019s last visit to you after you had your first baby ?  Now is when you get to find out if he really was sorry. This is his issue to take care of. He needs to tell his parents and sibling they are not invited until X date and WHY they are not welcome earlier.    \n\n\nAre you having a scheduled (early) delivery ?  How long is your friend\u2019s flight ?  Are you sure she\u2019s going to make it there in time ?  Subsequent babies can come pretty quickly.", "NTA. he said it would never happen again. here is his chance to follow up on ensuring that. and your best friend's presence is, in fact, different and separate.", "NTA- your husband should be explaining to his family that due to their terrible behaviour last time that ya'll are unable to host them again. This shouldn't even be a question or point of discussion. He needs to be standing up for you", "NTA remind your husband of the first merry go round and also the difference between support people and visitors. You want your best friend there as a support person- you can even refer to her as your doula if that helps in communicating with your in-laws- while your in-laws are visitors. It\u2019s fair to say support people only before x time. \n\nAlso whenever you are open to them visiting I absolutely would not let them stay with you.", "NTA, you aren't required to host anyone. If they want to visit, they can rent a hotel. If they make nasty comments while there, kick them out immediately. Have your friend come. As the one that just birthed another child, it should be about your comfort and support system right now. When your husband shoots a lemon out of his penis, it can be about his comfort and support system.", "NTA\n\nTell your husband and his relatives the truth. The ILs will not be welcome during your post partum time because they acted like complete assholes the last time and you are not interested in repeating the experience. They can visit when you have recovered from the birth and aren\u2019t so vulnerable.", "NTA! \n\nDon\u2019t let your husband guilt trip you into allowing your toxic in laws when you\u2019re not comfortable based on past experience. STAND FIRM", "NTA - but tell your husband if they come and make a single weight related remark you will kick them all out.", "Nope. Don\u2019t feel bad and don\u2019t cave. If you want your best friend for support, go for it. Clearly your husband forgets what your in laws said to you the last time - write it all down and lay it out for him in bullet form.", "NTA. There is the world of difference between a competent willing-to-help friend who is a nurse and the dead weight of three people who are expecting you to roll out the red carpet, host and entertain them. The first one you are lucky to have, the other three, not so much.", "And is your husband pushing a human out of his body? Doesnt sound like he will have your back with his family either way", "NTA you\u2019re the one giving birth, you decide whose staring at your genitals.", "NTA for not wanting the in-laws. \n\nI think you are going to lose the battle when it comes to your best friend though. Your husband doesn't have to accept visitors anymore than you do. At least not in the home. At the hospital it is 100% up to you, at home it is a two yes, one no situation.", "YTA - the issue is the lie.  Life has conflict - learn to deal with it.  Tell your husband the truth and let him handle his family.", "Yta as you can't use immune system on inlaws but then let friend travel. Surely if that was a real concern then friend wouldn't be allowed either. \nIf you are honest with them that you just don't want them to visit then that's different. \n\nAlso stop expecting guests to help you around your house. That's the job of your spouse. Guests come to see the new baby and wish you all well and usually have a few gifts. It's not their job to do your housework.\n\nI've had kids and do know what I'm talking about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
