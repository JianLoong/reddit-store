I think that lady and your sister would be good together.", "NTA this is weird.", "NTA \n\nI stand with you and your gallon of milk.", "NTA, that seems like such a minor thing to be upset about.   \n\n\nINFO: Is your family aware of your former alcoholism?", "NTA. Even if this is something that would be considered rude in your family for whatever reason (and I'll admit; this would be kind of weird in my family) they are all still blowing it way out of proportion.", "NTA. Once I read your post and the reason why you brought your own milk, it sounded reasonable to me. You could definitely ask her in the future if it is okay, I guess. But still, it sounds totally harmless to me.", "NTA. Their response was nonsensical, petty, unhinged.\n\nAgree, Skim milk is gross.", "NTA your family sucks if they know that your struggled before and this is how you handle it.\n\nIt's milk, you didn't bring pizza to someone's fancy dinner.", "NTA \nI would understand if you brought a whole different meal without telling her but full fat milk? They are just being drama llamas", "NTA - Others brought their choice of drinks and your drink of choice is milk.", "NTA. The hell?\n\nI don't really see it any different from bringing a bottle of wine or some other beverage. The thought of someone bringing a big damn bottle of milk to dinner is amusing and a bit odd, but why does it really matter? \n\nOf all things to get upset about it's a bottle of milk? \n\nSomeone may or may not have a stick that needs to be removed.", "I agree with you that skim milk is deeply unpleasant. You're an alcoholic and need access to a non-alcoholic drink you will drink. It's normal enough for people to bring drinks to dinners.\n\nNTA\n\nYour sister is being weird about it because she doesn't understand the place that milk occupies in your life.", "NTA.  People bring food and drinks they like to family gatherings all the time.  Whole milk is kind of weird but to each their own.  Who are they to deny you your drink of choice?\n\nMaybe ask them what they would suggest you should have done?  Like should you have called your sister in advance and asked her to buy the whole milk?", "NTA, others brought alcohol, I see no reason why you couldn't bring your milk. Sister should be proud of you for your continued sobriety. Jeez, when our \"kids\" come out they bring their beverages of choice because I'm not going to load up on stuff we don't drink. We provide the food for all.", "NTA. You knew your choice of beverage was uncommon and chose to bring it. That actually sounds polite. Your family must know about your recovery and should be supportive of whatever helps you in it.", "NTA   And honestly, good for you.  Other people brought a beverage, you brought a beverage. They brought booze, you don't drink booze and brought something else. It's for you - no one else has to drink it. Your sister, aunt, and cousin all need to calm down. It's just milk.", "NTA\n\nYour logic makes sense with milk as a beverage instead of food since it is an alcohol substitute.\n\nI do not know if your sister would have provided milk if she had known.  I could see her not wanting it in to he house if she makes her kid drink chalky water .", "NTA\n\nWhat in the feast day fuck? The magi (allegedly) brought gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the stable. You brought a gallon of rich n creamy moo juice to family table. I fail to see the problem with this. And why your family got their collective end-of-Christmas knickers in a twist over it is really mind-boggling. Drink your milk and let everybody else settle down, I guess. Blessed Epiphany!", "NTA and I commend you for your continued dedication to you health from a child of two alcoholic parents. I am sorry your family is so caught up in themselves they would rather see you stumble then get over their petty ass self to be proud of you. Stay strong and have a blessed new year.", "The only reason I can imagine being even slightly miffed would be due to how much space a whole gallon would take up in my fridge. NTA.", "NTA, sounds like a good sibling time to me \ud83d\ude04", "NTA I've had a friend bring whole milk over. We both found it funny and laughed it off.", "NTA but I come from a family where we all bring food whenever we visit each other, some to share and some because of diet, allergies or disordered eating (ARFID).  We wouldn\u2019t get offended if someone brought their entire own meal.  It\u2019s about the time we share with each other.  I couldn\u2019t imagine being mad over milk.", "Nta. But like a whole gallon? Bring a couple of those single serve things", "NTA. Really don\u2019t know what to say about this lol but you\u2019re definitely NTA. A good host/hostess wants their guests to be comfortable. Them getting so twisted up over you bringing a beverage is just bad hosting. You\u2019re NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is your family unaware of your past difficulties?", "NTA if the milk was your way of not being tempted to drink the good for you man.\nYour sister is unhinged for being offended you did not want her nasty skim milk and your aunt needs to mind her business.\nI'd see this as a blessing in disguise and your excuse to never interact those weirdos again.", "Did you need a whole gallon tho? I don\u2019t know anything about Greek culture, except that the women are hot.", "NTA\u2026 this is insane. For sure ask them what you could have done instead.  This is an insane hill to die on", "NTA. I'm actually the opposite and find whole milk too thick and gross--but that is beside the point. However, you brought you own milk because you didn't like the host's, nothing wrong with that, particularly since you are doing it to help stay sober. You would only be TA if you demanded she go out of her way and provide it for you.", "NTA\n\nHonestly  it would never occur to me to get mad over something that stupid. Good grief people can get weird.", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell?", "NTA. This is fairly unhinged and I don't even think you can explain it away as a 'cultural' thing. I just can't help wonder what list of other beverages would have also brought on this reaction.", "NTA, you knew what you wanted wouldn\u2019t be accommodated, so you brought your own. Maybe they wanted you to ask so they could be good hosts? But I am in disbelief that this is an issue after reading so many posts about vegans demanding their hosts make them entire separate meals at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and rightfully being called the AH. I\u2019m sorry your family is so sensitive, enjoy your milk", "NTA\n\nLike you said, it\u2019s no different than a different guest bringing their own preferred beverage to drink, such as a beer, wine, or soda.\n\nTo get so offended by milk that they ask you to leave?? Ridiculous", "NTA \nYou brought it yourself! It's not like you demanded something else be provided for you. \nYou are also 100% correct about skim water milk. \nSounds like there is an undercurrent of unresolved emotional issues in your family, too eh? Funny how that manifests itself in arguments over small, benign issues like milk. One of those times you walk away saying \"sounds like a you problem\".", "NTA. Its milk. Whats she so upset about?", "Skim milk haters! I was once like you! Only time I had skim was at grandma\u2019s. Grandma, being the exceptionally frugal woman she was, kept her fridge at 40F. Warm milk of any kind is an abomination. Keep your fridge at 34, and enjoy fresh, cold, delicious skim milk :)", "NTA, this is some grade A Greek family BS. You managed step on some kind of land mine that no sane person could possibly anticipate. Like bringing milk to someone\u2019s house is some kind of grave insult.", "NTA.  Que estupides tsss", "NTA skim is disgusting", "Jesus your family sounds stressful", "Absolutely NTA.  My partner and I only drink nonfat milk.  Whole milk has an awful \"mouth feel\" to me - it's just way too thick.  I absolutely understand that my non-fat milk tastes like vaguely milk flavored water to whole milk drinkers.  Anyone would be welcome to bring their own milk to my house. \n\nHowever, if she's aware of your preference, your sister is an AH for not bothering to have whole milk on hand for you when hosting a family dinner.", "A gallon of milk is not \u201cgroceries\u201d. Holy. \nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and infer that there\u2019s a lot going on and that your gallon of milk was just a ridiculous excuse for a fight. \n\nPeace + love = whole milk\n\nSkim is the devil NTA", "NTA.\n\nI drink lactose free milk, but if someone brings full cream, I won't be offended. \n\nPretty much any drink or food they bring. I don't get insulted.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t care if someone brought their own whole ass meal with them because they had dietary restrictions. If you showed up with a water bottle would anyone have been offended?  Maybe you should be mad that she didn\u2019t consider all of her guests preferences and provided you with your own milk.  I can\u2019t believe they all ruined a perfectly good evening because you brought a beverage to a party. HOW DARE YOU.", "NTA\n\nThey took \u201cbeware Greeks bearing gifts\u201d literally.", "NTA. If wine is okay, then milk should be too. Though a gallon seems a bit much, especially if you didn't bring a cooler & needed to to make room in the fridge.", "NTA. Skim milk really is gross. Is your sister really this sensitive, or, is she the type that finds ways to take offense?", "NTA and thank goodness my toddler is not part of your family. She\u2019d be kicked out of every family event and can be a beast so wouldn\u2019t leave quietly.", "NTA, but were you really planning to drink a gallon of milk during one dinner?", "Again, people need to pick their battles. This is not one of them. Maybe send the family a picture of a gallon jug of milk via text. Hahaha! No, seriously, who cares. If you drink the fully loaded milk to stay sober, then by golly, you drink it. You take it with you wherever you go! \n\nIf people really get their panties in a twist over this, just stay away from them. No one needs this kind of drama.", "NTA, Skim milk alone tastes weird if you're used to any % fat milk, it's not like you're mixing it with coffee/tea/etc. If you brought juice would that have been a problem? Was it only a problem because she already had a different kind of milk?\n\nOf course people bring drinks with them when going to a dinner. You are not the AH for bringing the drink you want.", "YTA It sounds like you made no effort beforehand to ask if you sister could organise some whole milk for you and just showed up with it wich can make her look like a bad host to some if not most ppl.", "ESH\n\nMainly, I think you probably should have asked before you did it. Bringing a gallon of milk to dinner is kinda weird, but I think you could have been fine if you had just asked your sister first, or even said \u201chey sis, I really only like whole milk, can you have some for me or I could bring some?\u201d I also think your sister should chill because that\u2019s sort of an extreme reaction.", "[deleted]", "I think this explains why OP had alcohol problems.  Non alcohol seems to be against the rules.", "I wanted to slap that stuck up little princess!", "Oh yeah\u2026they pulled me out the proverbial ditch many times", "Skim milk is just water lying about being milk", "??? That\u2019s wild. I would be ok unsubscribing from family if family cared more about face than blood.", "But wouldn't calling ahead to make special requests come off as needy or entitled?  The sister has the whole family meal to worry about.  Why burden her with a request for something literally one person is going to drink?", "Someone could make a mudslide?", "Then yeah, NTA. Your family should be more understanding and less dramatic over a glass of unspilled milk.", "Skim milk is akin to putting raisins in cookies and trying to pass them off as chocolate chips.", "From the post it seems that they don't really know the value of whole milk to OP so to them he just came in with smth of his one for himself wich in some if not most european cultures is seen as impolite and can make the host look unaccomodating. So informing her or just asking if you can just bring your own in advance could have prevented all of this mess.", "It definitely seems like there is more to the story here.  I figured there was family politics or other issues that primed the pump for this type of reaction.  But if this is a cultural faux pas, that would explain it as well."]}
