However it is at a small distance and pricey, so I understand why some may not want to. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a car; it helps with finances. We tried opting out of the parking space in our rent but management refused. So I guess we\u2019re paying for a spot we don\u2019t use all the time. Our relatives come by sometimes and it\u2019s nice to have a spot where they can safely park. When they\u2019re not here, our friend/neighbor parks his car with our permission.\n\nLately, a brand new, sparkly truck has parked in our spot.

It\u2019ll be a problem when our relatives come over. But I kind of feel bad. Would (we) be the asshole(s) if we towed her anyway?\n\n**EDIT:** It is up to the tenants to call the towing company.
