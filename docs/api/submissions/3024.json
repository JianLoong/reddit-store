NTA", "YTA - but soft. \n \nI was going to say NTA but then as I typed out this response I ended up changing my mind on that. \n \nI\u2019m queer and a-gender so what I\u2019m about to say should be read with a tone of acceptance and no judgment when it comes to gender stuff etc \n \nI\u2019m guessing the wig looks a bit feminine, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! \n \nBut I wonder if his mom isn\u2019t seeing it as being about long hair, but instead sees it as encouraging gender exploration in a 10 year old? For the record there\u2019s also nothing wrong with a 10 year old exploring different gender expressions, or identifying as a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth. \n \nIf mom *is* viewing the wig as more of a queer thing than a fun long hair thing, then I could see why she\u2019d be upset with you buying it without talking to her first. \n \nIf there is some gender exploration going on, then it seems reasonable to me for both parents to want and need to be involved in talking to your son, and making decisions together on how best to support him. \n \nLooking at the situation that way, I think any parent who makes arbitrary decisions without attempting to discuss it and work together with the co-parent, that impact something as deeply personal as gender identity and/or expression would be an AH. Unless there are huge extenuating circumstances that would prohibit working together on it. \n \nMy guess is it\u2019s a bit of that, and then also having it sprung on her out of the blue. If your son loves the wig and is wearing it all the time, she may not have been mentally or emotionally prepared to protect him and defend him from other people who will judge him for that. Dropping him off with the wig, with no consultation and no warning\u2026 that\u2019s kind of not cool to do to the other parent. \n \nIf the wig makes your son happy, then that\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m so glad! But I have a feeling you and his mom need to sit down as his parents and talk about it, what it might mean, how to handle similar situations if they come up in the future, etc\n \nEdit - For the record, OP stated he didn\u2019t know why the mom was angry over the wig, and asked us to \u201cenlighten\u201d him if we had any suggestions on that. That\u2019s literally what I\u2019m doing here. Providing suggestions, because frankly idk why mom would be upset over a present like this unless it was somehow gender related. The wig sounds super fun and the kid loves it, so idk what the issue could be otherwise. \n \nI\u2019m not saying the OP shouldn\u2019t have bought the wig. I\u2019m queer and a-gender, I am 100% on board with experimenting. Do all the things that make you feel comfortable in your own skin and your own life. I\u2019m also a goofball (please see the username), so wearing a wig just for fun with no gender questioning on the part of the kid is equally valid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What I *am* saying is that if he wants to avoid future arguments about this kind of thing, it might be good to have a conversation with the other parent and *try* to work together on it. \n \nThat doesn\u2019t mean both parents have to agree with each other. It doesn\u2019t mean that if one of them said no to a wig (or a truck, or a Barbie, or whatever gendered item you want to name), that the other one couldn\u2019t still buy the wig anyways. \n \nBut if you\u2019re co-parenting with someone, out of mutual respect for each other it\u2019s good to talk about things and not spring them on one another. That doesn\u2019t mean that works in every co-parenting situation, but ideally communication is super important to try to avoid misunderstandings and arguments. \n \nNormally I wouldn\u2019t have given any suggestions on why the mom might have been upset, or gone into any of that. Frankly she\u2019s an adult and she should be mature enough to articulate what\u2019s bothering her about it. But the OP said he\u2019d like to be \u201cenlightened\u201d on possible reasons why, so I gave him some thoughts on it. \n \nAlso, as a side note, many co-parents check with each other before big changes like the haircut you described.

So while long hair may have been walking the line when you were growing up, it's totally normal on men now.
