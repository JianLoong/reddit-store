Using fake names for obvious reasons.\n\nFirst some context: I (27M) became friends with Melanie (27F) when we were in kindergarten. We went to the same school, were always good friends, and we spent a lot of time together. There was a period of time where we dated from the age of 17 to 20, and we were in an on and off relationship.\n\nOver the years, Melanie also became friends with my sister Evelyn (30F). Mind you that Evelyn has always been the better sibling. The favorite, the successful, good-looking and charming one in the family. After my break-up with Melanie we tried to stay friends but drifted apart. After a while I was told that she started dating Evelyn. I was extremely heartbroken back then and I felt such a betrayal.\n\nThey got married 3 years ago, and Melanie gave birth to their first child, my niece, Hannah last year. I attended their wedding and was there for Hannah's birth but other than that, I've had very limited contact with Evelyn and Melanie because seeing them together still reminds me of the betrayal I felt and still feel.\n\nTherefore, when they asked me to join them for Hannah's birthday party, I declined and said I had to work. Evelyn offered to change the date for me but I refused. I think she got the message that I wasn't interested in spending time with them and told me I needed to grow up and start acting like family around them.\n\nI may be TA here because I told her she betrayed my trust and ended up marrying my first love and first girlfriend and she should have thought about the consequences back then. She called me pathetic and hung up and hasn't spoken to me ever since.

Actions have consequences and your sister has to face the outcome of her choices. Most people wouldn't date the ex of a sibling because of the hurt and division it could potentially cause.

People have their own will and if you new this girl from a young age your sister would have as well, meaning there were years for her to also build up feelings. Also she was your first girlfriend, basically no one stays with their first relationship because people grow up and become different people. You should look into getting some help for this, and I'm saying this in a caring way. You haven't mentioned any other relationships since and you're stuck on something from 7 years ago.

That's some high school energy. Sure, it would be a little sketchy if your ex went out with *anyone* the next day or next weekend just because it seems like they might have actually started before the break. But it sounds like there was a normal amount of time between your \"official\" breakup and them getting together.\n\nPast the timing aspect, by your own account, you and Melanie drifted apart after your pseudo-relationship ended. It sounds like many people would have considered you more acquaintances than friends, definitely not close friends. But even if you were close, why would Melanie going after her be a betrayal? Are people you know not allowed to date each other?\n\nMy best guess is this is a combo of:\n\n1. OP being jealous of Evelyn (\"Mind you that Evelyn has always been the better sibling. The favorite, the successful, good-looking and charming one in the family.\")\n2. OP resenting Melanie by knowing at some level that she wasn't that into him.

I know this because I too let losing \"the love of my life\" from my younger days cause all sorts of misery. \n\nI get it. I really do. But looking back I realize that I lost precious years to being angry and it did nothing positive for me. Having to see them together sucks. But try focusing on your niece. Be as cordial as you can with your sister and your ex and I bet that over time the \"fake it till you make it\" style of getting along may lead to a less painful relationship. \n\nMaybe you still need time, only you know for sure. But being angry isn't going to change anything. It's not going to break up your sister and her wife. It's not going to make your life better in any way. It's only going to keep you miserable, keep your family apart, and keep you from developing a relationship with your niece. I know it feels all consuming. But please try to make peace with the situation sooner rather than later. I wish I did.", "NAH\n\nBut, dude, it\u2019s been 7 years. And you and Melanie were already on and off - she hardly sounds like the love of your life. \n\nThe story reads that your way more pissed that the golden child won and that\u2019s always in your face rather than actually pining for your lost love. Jealousy is an incredibly toxic emotion and all that anger only hurts YOU. I\u2019d find a way to deal with that.\n\nThat said, marrying your siblings ex is a VERY hurtful thing for your sister to have done - even cruel. Going no contact with them may be for the best until you can work out your lingering anger and jealousy issues.", "soft YTA  \n\n\nMy guy, you had an on and off relationship with someone over a decade ago, during which there was no cheating/betrayal/trauma and you remained friendly--your ex (now your sister in law) would have been around your sister for years, building up famiiarity and rapport, and it wasn't until LONG after your breakup that they began dating. For you to harbor this much resentment over a half baked relationship that ended a decade ago is not emotionally healthy, nor is it fair to your sister, her wife, or your nibling for you to drag your resentments into your 30s and into your niblings early years of life. There was no \"betrayal\", your sister didn't steal your ex from you, you'd been broken up for years. Your ex didn't cheat on you with your sister, either. The only person causing this discord is you, everyone else has (as they should have) moved on. You deserve to move on, too.\n\nI say this with respect to the fact that old feelings can persist, and are valid in their own way: you should really talk to a therapist about this. To harbor this much resentment over a decade later is not fair to your sister, her wife, their child, or to yourself. If you continue to hold onto it, it will poison every relationship in your family, and the one you have with yourself. I hope you can find a way to let go of old hurt and find peace with yourself, but until you're able to let this go, you'll likely never find a fulfilling relationship of your own, either.", "Skipping your niece\u2019s birthday party won\u2019t cause real damage to anyone.

Your sister can live with the consequences of betraying you and you can live your life in peace.", "YTA. The vibe I get from this is that you're less mad about them together than about how you feel outshone by your sister. It'll be better for everyone if you move on with your life.

You never mentioned being heartbroken when the relationship ended, just when you found out she was dating your sister. You said that you remained friends but lost touch eventually. By your account she started dating your sister well after your last on-again period ended, and you said you two had actually grown apart as friends as well.\n\nYou didn't get cheated on. She didn't break up with you after three straight years together and go straight to your sister. The fact that you view this as a betrayal makes me think this is more about how you view your sister as being the \"better\" sibling in other people's eyes. This reeks of jealousy. You just sound petty and possessive. Melanie doesn't belong to you, your relationship was never that serious by your own admission, and by the time she and your sister got together you weren't even particularly close. \n\nETA: On the other hand, Melanie and Evelyn have been in a committed relationship for years, married for three, and now have a child together. What you had was a high school girlfriend you were never serious with. What your sister has is a wife. \n\nGrow up.", "NTA - yeah sure it's been a while so it makes sense to move on because that's healthy. That said Evelyn broke the sibling code, yes Melanie might be an ex, but hooking up with a siblings ex is one of the worst kinds of betrayal ever.\n\nI suggest for your own good to find a way to move on in a healthy way, but other than that staying NC with them is a perfectly valid response. What they're doing is all kinds of wrong", "This far in and still carrying a grudge? Yeah, YTA. \n\nYou dont get to dibs a person. Clearly they werent your person.

That really sucks what your sister did.", "This is difficult, as we don't own our partners or crushes but you have to remember that it ended for a reason and it wasn't going anywhere further. INFO: how long was it from when you last dated to her dating your sister? \n\nI remember one separation and a close friend asked if it's fine that they have interest in my ex, I said \" of course, I don't own them. Just know that I talk to them and still have interest in them. \" the same friend got all huffy when the ex and I got back. They aren't my puppet, pet, slave, etc. They are their own people and once they leave I don't have a say in what they do. Now there's a certain amount of respect, but that's when your best friends with a coupe for a few years and then want to bang one the moment they become single. \n\nYou are hung up and in the \"what if\" zone with her. There is no good ending for you with her, it was never going to work out. Relationship feel a lot more intense at that young age, so you are probably creating an over-exaggerated form of what things could have been.  Concentrate on yourself and your hobbies, join some activities/hobbies that have some of the other sex and make some friends, you still have the right person out there. Guys tend to hate paint night, but if you get in on that kind of thing then you can meet some nice locals and meet their friends (sometimes the hobbies just provide the friends, but they can lead to the true meetup).

Using fake names for obvious reasons.\n\nFirst some context: I (27M) became friends with Melanie (27F) when we were in kindergarten. We went to the same school, were always good friends, and we spent a lot of time together. There was a period of time where we dated from the age of 17 to 20, and we were in an on and off relationship.\n\nOver the years, Melanie also became friends with my sister Evelyn (30F). Mind you that Evelyn has always been the better sibling. The favorite, the successful, good-looking and charming one in the family. After my break-up with Melanie we tried to stay friends but drifted apart. After a while I was told that she started dating Evelyn. I was extremely heartbroken back then and I felt such a betrayal.\n\nThey got married 3 years ago, and Melanie gave birth to their first child, my nephew, Hunter, last year. I attended their wedding and was there for Hunter's birth but other than that, I've had very limited contact with Evelyn and Melanie because seeing them together still reminds me of the betrayal I felt and still feel.\n\nTherefore, when they asked me to join them for Hunter's birthday party, I declined and said I had to work. Evelyn offered to change the date for me but I refused. I think she got the message that I wasn't interested in spending time with them and told me I needed to grow up and start acting like family around them.\n\nI may be TA here because I told her she betrayed my trust and ended up marrying my first love and first girlfriend and she should have thought about the consequences back then. She called me pathetic and hung up and hasn't spoken to me ever since. Was I too harsh?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact that your sibling is willing to betray you just to get their shit wet is enough to never want to speak to them again. Your family are the people that are suppose to have your back.

It wouldn't have stopped them dating and getting married, but it may have helped you get over this victim mentality. I have siblings too. I often feel like my parents prefer them over me. Maybe they do maybe they don't,  but you know what? I don't tally everything up and hold it against my brothers or their children. Especially not against their kids. I have no kids and don't plan on having kids but i really love the relationships i have with my nieces and nephews. It's sad you're gonna deny yourself a chance to have a relationship with their kid and any future kids because big sis stole the girl you didn't even keep in contact with. Grow up or go to therapy.

They are married with a child, so obviously it\u2019s a little different than \u201cmy sibling waited a month to start casually dating my ex\u201d. \n\nOP, please seek therapy. Your sister did not betray you. There was no cheating, and you and Melanie- who, by your own admission, was both your and your sister\u2019s childhood friend (and no, you don\u2019t get to \u201cclaim\u201d someone you met in kindergarten)- were not a good fit.", "It doesn\u2019t say how long after they broke up that they started dating, they married 3 years ago, so figuring getting together and engagement it could be months to 2-3 years.\n\nPlus he feels worse as it feels like his ex chose the person that has always been picked over him and this just further compounds it for him.

He feels his sister did the golden child and everything reminds him of this especially his failed relationship, she could make it work where he couldn\u2019t.\n\nAt the end of the day there are billions of other people his sister could choose and she chose his ex, there\u2019s no way either of them didn\u2019t know that this would cause consequences for the family in some way.\n\nI think OP either needs to talk with someone about his feelings or if he can\u2019t accept what\u2019s happened then go LC/NC", "Who are you to gatekeep what healthy behavior would be in this situation?

They dated \u201con and off\u201d years ago and even drifted apart as friends after officially breaking up. There was no cheating, abuse or trauma.

Is it me or is it the sister that is the bad person? I was just saying what is okay for the sister to do sure seems okay for him to do as well.", "It's not a healthy dynamic already. He resents her for being the golden child.", "OP owns himself and he doesn\u2019t have to accept anything about them", "He's got as much a right to choose who he spends his time with as his sister, and if he doesn't want to spend time around his ex, that's entirely his right, and sis needs to suck it up.", "That's not how relationships work; if OP didn't care or gave them his blessing, sure. But having his first love become his SIL without at least a conversation to clear the air?\n\nEvelyn was hardly thinking about his feelings or considering him until she noticed he had pulled back. And her reaction was to berate him to treat them like family? Yeah real great job she did as his older sister first huh?", "I'm not cold, or unfeeling, or intent. I'm just unable to believe that an emotionally stable grown man with a level of maturity commensurate with his age could be so possessive over a woman he dated casually as a child that he would feel genuinely betrayed that she fell in love with and married his sister many years later. You, OP, and half the commenters in this thread are acting like Melanie was his wife, and that his sister married her after they'd divorced. But that's not what happened. She a childhood friend who was his on again off again girlfriend in his late teens, and then a friendly acquaintance for a year or two before they lost contract. ALL of this before she ever started dating his sister. Given their history, it's highly unlikely anyone thought he felt as strongly as he suddenly did AFTER he found out his ex was dating his sister. Who, he takes great care to mention, is the better-looking, more charming, better sibling. So pain me if I read his whole post as self-pitying BS born less of genuine love and heartbreak for what he had with Melanie, and more out of petty jealousy towards his sister.", "So follow me on this. He dated her on and off as a teenager. So they were never in a serious, committed relationship. They broke up, but he says they remained friends for a couple years until they drifted apart. Then, a couple years later at some point, she and his sister start dating. So there was no cheating. His sister didn't just pounce right after they broke up. And let's not forget that these are grown up, actual adults. Not children. Adults. Adults who, just like OP and Melanie, had also known each other their whole lives. And unlike them we're able to form a stable, healthy relationship and marriage.", "Its just you. Your mindset is that of a juvenile. Grow up.", "Good point.  Does not change her selfish trashiness.", "17 to 20 are formative years with high emotions through hormones. \n\nWith how it is described you have no idea how on again / off again was experienced by OP as well as Melanie. And OP is entitled to his emotions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree he should be able to get over it, but it hasn't even been that long. And he doesn't owe his sister of his ex his family allegiance, when they didn't even take the time to check how he would feel about this relationship.\n\nAnd there is also the resentment of OP always feeling overshadowed by his sister. All in all, I get OP's statement in the heat of the moment."]}
