We are both in college with part time jobs and we live together. \n\nWe do not use a condom but I am on birth control because that is his preference and I am okay with it. So, at one point, the conversation of kids came up.\n\nWe haven\u2019t discussed kids much, but he knows I want at least one. Anyway, one day we were just chatting until he joked that he would leave me if I ever got pregnant. We enjoy dark humor so I simply joked back that I wouldn\u2019t let him leave. \n\nAfter some more playful banter, he became a bit angrier and eventually started saying things like \u201cI have every right to walk out if you get pregnant\u201d and that we were too young for kids. He told me that it is his choice to completely leave and not pay child support either. He said its not his responsibility if he doesn\u2019t want it to be.\n\nI was extremely furious and called him every name under the sun as I packed a bag to go stay in my friends dorm for the night. He continued yelling at me as I went out the door and I assume he told his family members and my sister directly after I left, because his mom texted me after falling me a whore for even thinking of \u201cdragging her son into my pregnancy\u201d. I called her a slut for giving birth to him and blocked her.\n\nIts the next day today, and I reflected a bit and talked about it to my friend. She said my reaction was a bit harsh as my boyfriend has a right to not be involved if he got me pregnant. I disagreed with her and told her that he DOES have responsibility, but she made me see that my reaction was a bit much.

Honestly though do you really want to be in a relationship with a man that would not take responsibility in something he had a fair share in creating, i.e. pregnancy?

What steps is your boyfriend taking to ensure that you do not become pregnant?  \n\nI understand that you are on birth control,  but that is what YOU are doing.   \n\nIt takes two to tango, and he is asking you to take all the precautions and assume all the responsibility.   Until this changes,  recommend abstinence to him.\n\nYou are the AH for getting into an argument with his mom and calling her names.   This discussion should only be between the two of you.

If HE gets you pregnant, HE is 100% responsible for that child, and the courts will say the same thing. He can say it's not his problem and he won't have to pay child support all he wants. But the reality is he's still basically just a dumb kid and he obviously doesn't know how the real world works because he will definitely be required to pay child support whether he wants to or not, unless he wants to live the following 18 years working shitty cash jobs evading child support and taxes. He told you without a doubt the type of person he is. I really hope you believe him. NTA.", "Hahaha. Yeah, best to avoid pregnancy and make royal mom happy by dumping him and tell every girl at college about his attitude. Just to make sure he hasn't to be involved in a pregnancy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The people around you sound ridiculous, cruel and immoral. If your boyfriend doesn't want to be a father, he can get a vasectomy or be celibate. He can't cause a pregnancy and then say he isn't responsible. Dump the boyfriend.", "So a few things here:\n\n1) NTA.\n\n2) What you're doing here is called borrowing trouble from the future. You're not pregnant. This is a hypothetical situation, which blew up into a huge argument for no reason whatsoever. It's easy to make grandiose statements, but it's entirely possible that both of you would react differently if you actually were pregnant. But neither of you wants kids right now, neither of you are trying for kids, so the two of you created this disagreement out of thin air. \n\n3) That said, there's a famous quote: \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\" He might change in the future. He also might not. And even if he did change his mind about kids, he's demonstrated an ability to make mountains out of molehills and to drag other people into your private relationship. Is that really someone you want to have around?\n\n4) Legally, he does have responsibilities to any child he creates. Paying child support is not optional. If the court declares that he owes it, and you press the issue, they will go after him for what is legally required. You can't just declare that you want nothing to do with a child; as a man, our opportunity to not support a child is to not have sex with its mother. If we create a child, we are legally on the hook. We can't just declare that we're not interested.", "Wow...that escalated quickly. \n\nAt least you got to see who he was well before this hypothetical pregnancy became a reality.", "This was unnecessary drama, so I'm voting ESH. He doesn't want kids, you want kids, therefore you're not compatible. End of story. The conversation and relationship should have ended there.

Personally I hate losing my temper and being vulgar, but if someone throws petrol on a fire, they are going to get burned. \n\nThis conversation was only playful on a surface level, both of you were being honest and disguising it with a jokey manner. If a man tells you he wont take responsibility for any baby that comes into the world-believe him. If he is willing to have sex with you and abandon any baby you make together - dump him unless you want to become a single mother. It would be cruel to bring a baby into the world with a man like that as a father. \n\nAnother point- why would your friend think he could walk away from the situation?", "Well, at least you know he would be a dead beat dad, but knowing that.... why are you with him at all?\n\nNTA", "ESH.
