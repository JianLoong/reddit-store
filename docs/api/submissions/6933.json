He told me that it is his choice to completely leave and not pay child support either. He said its not his responsibility if he doesn\u2019t want it to be.\n\nI was extremely furious and called him every name under the sun as I packed a bag to go stay in my friends dorm for the night.

I called her a slut for giving birth to him and blocked her.\n\nIts the next day today, and I reflected a bit and talked about it to my friend.

If HE gets you pregnant, HE is 100% responsible for that child, and the courts will say the same thing. He can say it's not his problem and he won't have to pay child support all he wants. But the reality is he's still basically just a dumb kid and he obviously doesn't know how the real world works because he will definitely be required to pay child support whether he wants to or not, unless he wants to live the following 18 years working shitty cash jobs evading child support and taxes.

He can't cause a pregnancy and then say he isn't responsible. Dump the boyfriend.", "So a few things here:\n\n1) NTA.\n\n2) What you're doing here is called borrowing trouble from the future. You're not pregnant. This is a hypothetical situation, which blew up into a huge argument for no reason whatsoever. It's easy to make grandiose statements, but it's entirely possible that both of you would react differently if you actually were pregnant. But neither of you wants kids right now, neither of you are trying for kids, so the two of you created this disagreement out of thin air. \n\n3) That said, there's a famous quote: \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\" He might change in the future. He also might not. And even if he did change his mind about kids, he's demonstrated an ability to make mountains out of molehills and to drag other people into your private relationship. Is that really someone you want to have around?\n\n4) Legally, he does have responsibilities to any child he creates. Paying child support is not optional. If the court declares that he owes it, and you press the issue, they will go after him for what is legally required. You can't just declare that you want nothing to do with a child; as a man, our opportunity to not support a child is to not have sex with its mother. If we create a child, we are legally on the hook. We can't just declare that we're not interested.", "Wow...that escalated quickly. \n\nAt least you got to see who he was well before this hypothetical pregnancy became a reality.", "This was unnecessary drama, so I'm voting ESH.

Personally I hate losing my temper and being vulgar, but if someone throws petrol on a fire, they are going to get burned. \n\nThis conversation was only playful on a surface level, both of you were being honest and disguising it with a jokey manner. If a man tells you he wont take responsibility for any baby that comes into the world-believe him. If he is willing to have sex with you and abandon any baby you make together - dump him unless you want to become a single mother.

If she opts to go forward, it's on both people to support the child.", "I believe this guy doesn't want to be child free but doesn't want the responsibility of a child right now in this stage in life. \nTo be honest I get where he is coming from, I spent a lot of my teenage years parenting my siblings because my parents couldn't be bothered too. Now that I am old enough to live on my own and make my own living and be free of such a burden, my biggest fear is getting someone pregnant and them wanting to keep the baby. Why? Because that would tie me down and I would have responsibility other then myself again which I don't want. \nOf course if he gets her pregnant he needs to care for the child but at least I can understand that he finds that unfair or doesn't want this to happen.", "You do realise a condom is less effective than the pill?\n\nAlso if he gets a vasectomy he doesn't need to wear a condom?", "Than could you cite your source?", "Are you saying your mom terminated HER rights or your dads because those are two VERY different situations from a legal standpoint.\nIt\u2019s possible to have your rights terminated if the other parent agrees and is SOUNDLY financially stable but I\u2019m talking solid six figure salary levels of stable \nTwo twenty something\u2019s with mid level jobs and the mom not agreeing, not a snowballs chance in hell", "You keep using the word \"entrapment\"; that doesn't apply here at all.\n\nYou're looking for \"reproductive coercion\", which might weigh in on something like this.", "\"She even brought her scissors if you misplaced yours.\"", "You are welcome to interpret it differently!  You asked where it was implied, and for me it's there.  \n\nLook, I'm not saying he 100% interpreted her the way I think he did.  But acting like either his statement OR her reply is a \"joke\" is pretty silly.  \"I'd leave you if...\" is nobody's idea of comedy.\n\nThat's the joy of r/AmITheAsshole.

Girls in this scenerio are on so much worse position, becouse they always stay with the baby and it flip their world upsite down. If u wanna put your cock between someone legs always remeber that it can end with baby and take responsibility for that..", "Condoms protect against more than pregnancy alone. I always go for 2 forms of BC, because birth control fails. Condom breaks? BC pill as backup. I'm responsible for taking my pill correctly and I expect my partner to do their part by wearing condoms..\n\nIf he got a vasectomy then that plus the pill should protect them fairly well. I'd still stick with condoms also. The kind of person who doesn't want to wear condoms, but also wants zero responsibility for a child they helped to create, is not necessarily a trustworthy partner..", "which is why they should do both NTA", "Personal experience: sitting in a court room for hours at a time spanning over 3 months while my mother put every ounce of her being into abandoning me, and winning because my dad poked holes in condoms and the court judged in her favor", "My mom terminated HER rights and the court agreed under the grounds of entrapment because my dad admitted to poking holes in the condoms", "If you're looking for me to defend abortion bans, you're looking in the wrong place. But that's a separate topic.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you but I\u2019m going to need actual evidence. If a dad could just handwave away child support by saying \u201cI don\u2019t want a kid\u201d, it would be all over the news. MRAs frequently demand these types of \u201cfinancial abortions\u201d, but the reason they\u2019re demanding it is because they don\u2019t really exist.\n\nYour situation seems extremely unusually because what your dad did sounds like \u201cstealthing\u201d, which is an illegal sexual assault.", "I usually defer to statutory citations over the memory of a traumatized minor.", "So your dad committed a crime. That is very different than if her hormonal birth control fails, which is very possible. The natural failure percentage of birth control doesn't show she committed a crime as he always had the option to use a condom, as is his responsibility.", "OMG I am so sorry that had to be horrible to find out, or go through if you were old enough to understand.\nFortunately it is t any where near the norm. The overriding idea of terminations is what is best for the child. What happened between the parents is usually not really considered", "Not looking for you to defend anything.

After 7 years she decided she didn\u2019t want to be a mother anymore, and my dad had come clean about the condoms after they found out she was pregnant. She chose to stay with him and to not get an abortion, all of this came up in court and she used hormones as her excuse for keeping me and staying.

Also I didn\u2019t say anything about OP in my post so not sure why you\u2019re typing in all caps at me about that.", "No, no it is not. Not legally or ethically. No court has ever decided that. Entrapment is not an accidental pregnancy happening with no mal intent.", "It's not entrapment. Your mums situation was very different as your dad made the sex non-consensual by tampering with the condom without her knowledge (people have gone to prison for that).
