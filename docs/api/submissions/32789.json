I tried to get him to tell me the truth on his own at first but he lied over and over again until I told him I had all the screenshots already. He cried, apologized, and for whatever reason, I forgave him. \nFast forward to 6 months ago.  I could tell he was acting off again. Similar to how he was last time I caught him so I asked to see his Snapchat. (It had been years since I had asked to see his phone and honestly thought I was letting my anxiety get the better of me) \nI guess he assumed I would just go through his chats, see nothing, and call it a day. But instead I downloaded his snap data and found out about a women he had been sexting for months. I asked him about her and he said they only ever talked about baseball games never anything inappropriate. So to call him out, I sent her nude back to him and said that I didn\u2019t see any baseball gear in this picture. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI assumed he would do the same as last time, cry and apologize until I forgave him. But wow was I wrong. \nThis man tried to keep the lie going! He said he didn\u2019t remember seeing that picture and that I was wrong for going through his Snapchat data. He continued to gaslight me and deflect everything back to me for the next few days until he finally apologized and acknowledged how badly he had messed up. \nI was heart broken and didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. We have 2 kids together, one of which needed a lot of extra care. I didn\u2019t know if I could do everything on my own.  \nI talked to my therapist and decided that I would give him a few months to show me how sorry he truly was and attempt to fix our marriage. He started off well but has tapered off since. \nThe biggest issue I have run into lately is that I keep waking up in the middle of the night to him going through my phone. I have never ever given him any reason to feel the need to do this and I have nothing to hide. Anytime he wants to look through it all he has to do is ask and I\u2019ll hand it over. It just feels  wrong to have him sneak around and do it while I\u2019m sleeping. This last time I caught him, I told him I would be changing my password to one he wouldn\u2019t know.
