But even if it feels like it now, it won't last forever. The first Christmas after a loss is always going to be hard, but so will lots of other firsts, seconds and thirds.

They've also lost someone and probably feel like they're losing their mother too. Normality and stability are so important for them right now. You can and should do Christmas, but share with them that it might be different this year, that they will probably feel sad too. Maybe even confused and guilty about enjoying the holiday even though they miss their grandfather and know their mother is upset. \n\nGrief counselling would be hugely beneficial for her, but can be prohibitively expensive.

It took my Mom years to leave. \n\nYour wife HAS A FOUR YEAR OLD and three other kids. Being a Mom isnt a job you get to quit or fuck up because your Dad died. She needs to go to therapy/inpatient for complicated grief or she needs to leave and let you parent the kids alone. Right now she is selfishly wallowing in her pain and is being an absolutely horrible mother as a result. Her current behavior ranges from unacceptable to neglectful/abusive. None of this is ok. And she thinks all of you should suffer. This is a disconnection from reality OP. She needs psychiatric help whether she wants it or not.\n\nOP please stand up for your kids and for your wife. They need a normal Christmas and a mother who at the very least doesnt aggress against them. She is punishing them for being alive when her father is not. You need to protect them from her right now and to protect her from herself. Her reaction to his death is so outsized that she may need strong medication and involuntary inpatient care.

However she can\u2019t punish her kids for something that wasn\u2019t their fault.\n\nI was an adult and my moms main caretaker when she passed.  I lived with my parents at the time and my dad was the one who worked. Mom had cancer and needed someone to be there 24/7 because of it.  My only sister lived out of state and couldn\u2019t take over at all.  When she passed away we all reacted differently to it for first Christmas. My sister who didn\u2019t live with us wanted the house to be decorated by the time she came to visit. My dad decided we would travel to visit his sister every year for dinner because he didn\u2019t want to take over the cooking. This was also the case for all holidays.  On the other hand I needed to face that.  I wanted us to have no decorations but not leave the house.  My dad and sister won out.  It wasn\u2019t till a few years later when my dad was in the hospital and I was at the house alone on Thanksgiving or Easter that I finally got my closure I needed.  My dad died shortly after that and when I finally moved away from that house and into my own apartment did I truly heal.  For the last two years I spend the holidays alone and to me it\u2019s the best holidays I have had since my mom passed.  As horrible as that is to say.  I still see my sibling around the holidays but not on the holiday.  This has helped me move on faster than if I had been with family.\n\n\nSo my judgment as a whole is NAH.  It\u2019s a difficult thing all around but there has to be some compromise from the wife.  She can choose not to celebrate but she can\u2019t expect her kids to not celebrate something they do every year.  It would be different if you only had a baby.  Someone under the age of 2 can go without it for a year.  \n\nMy suggestion is to ask her is this something that she only wants to be for this year or every year after that?

Her behavior with the kids is neglectful and abusive.

Even if someone you love dies, you are a parent first and foremost. \n\nThe reason I mentioned my own experience is because after my mother passed, I sunk into the depths of depression, attempted suicide also and basically drank myself into oblivion for months. During that time, my husband(now ex) took care of me and enabled me. It was amazing on his part, because that's how I worked through my grief, but the thing that made me snap out of it, was finding out I was pregnant. I knew I had to get my ish together for my baby.\n\nI've struggled with my mental health my entire life, but the one factor that has kept me alive and fighting is my son.\n\nTough Love is still love.

Mental illness isn't some horrible thing. Putting her in the hospital for physical health issues wouldn't have negative connotations, but mental health does? The brain is just a sick organ too. You wouldn't put some \"lunatic\" in a \"crazy home\" but rather a person who is suffering is a psychiatric hospital.\n\nThirdly, there are not always signs of things.
