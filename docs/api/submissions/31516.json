If this was something she was concerned about, she should have asked him about it in advance.\n\nThis just isn't cool.\n\nIf he is not going to defend you, then how are you supposed to be supportive in this situation?\n\nJust not cool for you.\n\nImagine how the daughter would have felt if you would have called her mom about it?  Like that could have come off embarassing and like a big deal was being made...   Sounds like  you did the right thing.", "NTA Oh my goodness, it's not like you caused your boyfriend's daughter to have her first period when she was with you during one of his custodial weekends. What were you supposed to do? Tell the the poor girl \"See if you can hold it in and let me track down your mother because I don't want to buy you a bag of pads and make sure you know how to use them?\"  Ridiculous people and their over the top reponses never fail to astound me.", "NTA - You were not respected despite your commitment to these relationships.\n\nHe could have said, \"We are not mind readers. We did not disrespect you. We had no idea the role you wanted to play. Please be proactive in stating you preferences in the future.\"  -- Notice the 'we'. He does not present you as a united front to her (or others?) but when it is convenient he'll accept your dedication to his daughter. This is BS.\n\nShe 'took this' away from herself. Mom created this outcome. She never conveyed her preferences re: her daughter's first period. This is completely on her then had a huge reactive behavior after the fact. If this or another event is important, either parent needs to state this verbally and in writing to the other.\n\nRefusing to care for your stepdaughter by making dad 'present' on his days is fine however, continue to support and cultivate the relationship you and her already have. The child should not be aware of your request and his need to change  schedules. Kids have no control of their parent's obligations. They simply want to be loved, accepted and not the source of relationship friction in either home. Best to you", "No, I really don't think you're the problem here. NTA.\n\nWhat was expected of you and was that made clear? If not then you were given responsibility to act using your best judgement. And frankly, I'm not sure what the mother expected. For you to just let her bleed everywhere? To just throw a pad at her and say \"ask your mom\"? How were you supposed to know that the expectation was for you to immediately call her for her to violate custody so she can come in and take her daughter away?\n\nYou acted with the daughter first and foremost in mind. If you continue to care for her, you will continue to make **her** the priority and not the parent's ego. If they don't like that, then yep, 100% nope the fuck out of ever being alone with her. That drama is not worth the stress.\n\n**Edited** for a whole other thing: My step daughter was with her dad (husband) and my family on a beach vacation when she got her period. Her mother not once was on my radar. Getting her home (yes, we were actually at the beach in her little tankini), clean and comfortable was the priority. Besides, she was already well informed and prepared for this, so it wasn't some mystery that could finally be revealed to her. In fact, trying to keep her dad from blowing it out of proportion was the bigger issue (although I was bad and had a chuckle at his expense by pointing out she can get pregnant now). \n\nThe point is that no one gets to pick when their period starts or who they are with. It's absolutely ludicrous to get twisted over this. If anything **she should thank you** for being there for her daughter and supporting and helping her.", "NTA\n\nYour BF needs to make arrangements to actually spend time with his daughter during his visitation days instead of passing her on to you.", "I feel sorry for your stepdaughter, because none of this is her fault.\n\nBut I also don't think it's healthy for you to be responsible for her while not being allowed to be responsible for her. \n\nIf you can't make decisions on childcare while she's with you, then you're in an untenable position.

You helped this young lady navigate the situation when you were out with her. It's not like these things can be scheduled! You did your best, and I am sure your stepdaughter was grateful for your guidance. As a woman, I am certain you knew what to do/say to handle it, so why would you call her mother? Unless the mother \\*specifically\\* told you that she MUST be the one and only one to help her daughter deal with her first period and to contact her immediately, you did no wrong. I get that your BF doesn't want to add to any tension, but he could have defended you.", "Info: no judgment yet, how long have you been with ur bf? How long have they been seperated? Finally the mother know that you take care of her daughter when the father is at work?", "Don\u2019t blame you a bit. Any woman taking care of this girl would have done the same thing under the circumstances. NTA.", "NTA. Periods are a fact of life and you handled it perfectly by explaining and assisted as needed. Its not a big deal and her mother is making it out to look like you robbed her of some once in a lifetime experience.", "NTA. Her mother is being ridiculous.  The child was cared for and even educated in a sensitive manner.  The fact that he allowed her to complain and agreed with her without defending you means he just lost his free babysitter", "NTA \n\nYou did nothing wrong, however, your bf caved to his ex and didn't back you up. You used common sense and kindness. He used cowardice. \n\nWelcome to the preview of the next installment of \"What Happens When I Live With an AH who has an ex and a kid!\"", "NTA because like you said, you're between a rock and a hard place.  \n\nShe may like you but the point of the visitations is to see her dad. Not for him to work and for her to be with you all day. If he can't change his schedule or find a different job to accommodate his weekends with his daughter, then he should petition to update visitation to his days off so he can spend quality time with her, and do some of the day-to-day parenting (school drops offs/pickups, homework, etc.).", "NTA. If it was that important to her mother to be there during her first period, she could have conveyed that to you ahead of time lol. For her to be \"livid\" is ridiculous. She should have been happy that her daughter had a woman there to help out and help make the experience smooth for her. Does her mother know you watch her alone while her father works? Maybe that's what she was actually livid about.", "NTA. This kind of thing is likely to happen again in the future, so it is better to extract yourself politely from the free babysitting duty. Also, what is the point of visitation if the father is not available? You did the right thing.", "NTA. My eldest daughter started hers when she was away at her dad\u2019s (navy dad so when she does get to see him she usually goes a full week). He is her parent & between him & his partner they took care of her like caring adults. \n\nI really don\u2019t see why her mum has lost her mind over this as the only thing on my mind was making sure my daughter knew where the pads were in my house & asking her to let me know when she was close to running out (I don\u2019t get periods due to having the implant).", "NTA. If the kid wanted her she could have called her.", "Good for you. NTA\n\nHe doesn't get to use you for free babysitting and then let you get blamed for making appropriate decisions while doing so.\n\nThat said...I think if I were with a girl who got her period, I'd help her out and then ask her if she wants to call her mom. But then again, she probably has a phone and always knew she could. Which may mean that she was embarassed and didn't want to make a big deal of it, which means you did the right thing and the mom isn't thinking about her daugther, but about herslelf.", "NTA.\n\nNo, you shouldn't have called his ex. You were the adult on duty and you're just as capable of dealing with menarche as his ex. She may have wanted to be involved in that milestone for her daughter and just wasn't able to, so she can deal with it like an adult.\n\nYou have a bf problem. He lacks the spine to stand up to his ex and shut her down when she's unreasonable. With that in mind, he gets to take over all care for his daughter and not rely on you to help; he doesn't get to have your help and then let his ex shit on you for it.\n\nAlso, have a discussion with your stepdaughter about it and explain the issues. Get her thoughts on the matter.", "NTA\n\nImagine if you hadn\u2019t been there, but her dad was. Would all 3 of them been comfortable?\n\nMany men have no idea how to cope with their daughters first period - that is \u201cmums job\u201d. But if he hadn\u2019t had you, he would have had a distraught, scared daughter bleeding and wouldn\u2019t have known what to do.\n\nHis daughter would have faced the embarrassment of trying to tell her dad that she was bleeding. Did she even know what was going on? I\u2019ve known girls who didn\u2019t realise what a period was when it happened.\n\nAnd mum would still have missed it\u2026.", "NTA. While I am not female, somehow I can't equate her first period with baby's first steps or first words. This is something that mother knew could happen at any time (starting at daughters age?) but feel free to say this is a momentous event for mother and daughter to bond over?\n\nOP, you were there for this almost stepdaughter and helped her deal with the situation. I'm sure she was fine and appreciated being with a woman she knew instead of Dad having no clue what to do.", "NTA... in fact I'm surprised the mom is okay with you watching her while dad is at work... I don't judge parents either way but visitation tends to be for the biological parent.. not their gfs... if she's cool with you watching her I find it hard to believe that the relationship between mom and dad is so bad he couldn't simply say \"op didn't realize you'd be upset. She, and I, thought she handled it.\" Idk", "NTA - You can do what you want, you are not responsible for her. But it's a shame that there's this problem just because mom is overreacting.", "No, not in the least. You did your best and only succeeded in pissing everyone off. Leave the rearing of your boyfriend's daughter to him and his ex, you'll never win in this situation...", " NTA- Why did the mom leave the daughter in the dark and unprepared?", "NTA. It would have been good for you to give the mother a call, but I don't blame you for not thinking of it in the moment. You certainly don't deserve to be berated for it.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to man up and back you up if he wants you to look after his kid. \n\nThough I think the mother way overreacted, I understand why she's upset. It's hard missing your kid's important moments while they're being \"parented\" by someone who's a stranger to you. Not saying she was in the right, but maybe try to see where she's coming from.\n\nFinally, I would avoid situations where you're doing parenting duties for your boyfriend. He already only has her on weekends and he should be using that time. It might be better for the girl to just stay with her mother if he's not going to be there.", "Nta, mom should probably have been notified, but overall you were trying to do what's best for the kid. If he's just going to let her blast you then he shouldn't expect you to take care of a kid that is his responsibility.", "NTA I have a SD who has only asked me about periods. We have had plenty of conversations about it. She says she feels safest with me. So I will do whatever is necessary. \n\nBM can yell at me all she wants. I dare her to. Because she knows that I remember her pathetic lies better than anyone else\n\nr/stepparents join us", "NTA\n\nIt's nobody's fault that she had her first period with you.  You honestly probably should have called her mom.  I am surprised SD didn't want to call her mom.  I was a stepmom for close to 12 years.  I accidentally stepped on some mom toes quite a bit.  My intentions were good.  I loved my xSD with all my heart.  But I was young & naive & not a mom.  I didn't realize telling my xSD I'd make her a Belle dress for Halloween was not my place.  As a mom, I'd be livid in her shoes.  Now as a mom & with some experience in life, I know there are experiences/firsts that are momentous & parents don't want to miss.  This is one of those moments for a mom.\n\nStanding up for you is easier said than done when it comes to co-parenting.  Your BF has to choose his battles.  This is one he didn't choose.  And I can't say that I blame him.  There's nothing that he could have said that would have lessened her anger.  Welcome to step life.  Decide now if you want to stay.  Because he's not going to stand up for you over everything.  He has to decide which battles to fight, which are worth potentially damaging his co-parenting relationship.", "NTA\n\nHe won't defend you, he needs to deal with it.", "NTA", "NTA. This young woman was on Dad\u2019s time and in your care. Not your job to loop her Mom in.

Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well for the relationship. His poor daughter. To have this drama and yelling around her first period sucks.", "NTA. How absurd. You were who was available to help her during her first period. There\u2019s no wrongdoing here. It sucks that she missed this event, but that\u2019s what happens when parents split up - someone always misses the milestones.", "This kinda depends on how your \"stepdaughter\" feels about you. If you have been with her father for years and now all of sudden you want nothing to do with her because of her mom then yea you're an asshole. \n\nDevil's advocate if this is the first or one of few disagreements you had with the mother I say cut her some slack. She was upset she missed a big moment in her daughter's life.

If you act normal and don\u2019t let that crazy lady get at you, their daughter will be closer to you then her mother.", "NTA, you made the right call. probably better the daughter was with you than mom anyway", "NTA, but I do think asking him to change the custody arrangements is over reacting a bit.  Mom is being a drama queen.  Guys don't want to deal with women's periods so he mentally checked out.  It doesn't make him a bad guy.  He should have given his ex hell for treating you that way though.\n\nI think Mom is over the top in her reaction on this and I think that was by intent if she is normally difficult to deal with as you say.  You did the right thing by helping this young girl; the first period can be scary.  Mom is probably hoping you will push to change the visitation schedule..", "Yes, you are the jerk in the scenario. As the stepmother of this young girl, you took the role of caring for her and that includes her feelings and well being. Instead of calling her mother as soon as you had discovered her menstruation, you took the time to explain it to her as if she was a child (you never said she asked you your opinion). And then when you were berated for it by the girl's mother, instead of apologizing, you refused to take responsibility for your actions and you decided to punish the girl for your shortcomings.", "YTA. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s right that his ex is difficult and he\u2019s just trying to manage the co-parenting situation.\n\nYou\u2019re being immature to no longer want to care for her. If that\u2019s the case, just break up. You\u2019re either partners or you\u2019re not.", "YTA - Respectfully, you were not involved in any conflict.\n\nIt's not like she contacted **YOU** about being upset.

You know who will suffer the most from that decision ? Spoiler alert : it's not the mom. It's the step daugther.\n\nWhy would you punish a child for the actions of her mother ?! That's cruel. Fix your adult conflicts like adults.", "ESH, except that poor little girl. You were doing great, OP, until you petulantly decided you wouldn\u2019t continue being a parent to a kid who had come to rely on you enough to come to you at a really big moment.  Yeah, it sucks to get crap from her mom and not to feel like dad is backing you up. But you don\u2019t bail on the kid over that. It\u2019s not her fault", "YTA for treating the daughter like this situation was her fault.  You can still have a good relationship with her.  If you're staying with your BF be prepared for other blowups, because that is the ex's way to express herself.  \nHer mother is out of line.  You did the right thing.  Nobody was told ahead of time that the ex must be notified at the first sighing of menstrual blood. Who could have predicted that she'd go nuts?  If she felt that strongly she should have told her daughter to tell her immediately when she started menstruating.  Your boyfriend didn't defend you because it would have been pointless.", "YTA. while they are clearly assholes, why sink to their level. You did the right thing. Don\u2019t make the daughter suffer because her parents are too immature to see the actual important things here.", "TA and NTA - You should have called either the hubby or her mom. The daughter may have wanted her mom but didn't know how to tell you. \n\nIt sounds as though your hubby has issues with his ex. You should understand that some battles are best to walk away from.", "NTA\n\nYou did absolutely the right thing. Can the mom be upset she missed it? Sure. But yelling about it? That's unacceptable. Especially given that her daughter was given the option to tell her, and chose not to. That's a big point in your favour. Your stepdaughter felt that safe with you, and probably kenw her mother would overreact.\n\nBut what's worse is your BF. The fact that he didn't defend you makes you absolutely in the right to refuse to be the primary caregiver while he works. He'll throw you under the bus again, and next time, it might be a very serious problem. Protect yourself.\n\nSide note - what is with this sudden wave of mothers and daughters 'bonding' over the first period? My mother was out when I got mine. I told my dad, he sorted me out in a few minutes, told mum when she came home, she checked I was fine, that's it. No bonding whatsoever. If there's bonding, it comes in the years before when you discuss periods, changing bodies, and implications. If the mom didn't have those talks, then that's on her.", "NTA perfectly reasonable response.", "NTA. Legit approach", "NTA:  But what's really sad is that instead of vilifying you, bio-Mom should be thanking life that there's another woman involved in her daughter's life who can help with matters like this.  Sadly...I also agree you're doing the right thing with the bf.  Either he backs you up or he can be the responsible parent here.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you could have done differently is ask your stepdaughter is she wanted to call her mom. Otherwise, you acted appropriately in the moment. Your stepdaughter's mother should have explicitly told you that she wanted to be the one helping her daughter through her first period. What was she expecting you do in the moment? Let her daughter sit there and bleed while you waited for mommy? Your reaction is appropriate.", "NTA.  You dealt with an immediate emergency in the appropriate way.  The mom wanted to treat it as some kind of mother/daughter right of passage.", "NTA, I think you did the right thing. \n\nThis isn\u2019t something like shaving, where it can wait. It was an emergency and you helped.\n\nMom needs a chill pill, and dad needs to nut up a bit. It\u2019s his kid too.", "NTA. Completely reasonable what you did and completely reasonable what you\u2019re saying now. Nobody communicated with you. I am guessing your boyfriend wasn\u2019t told either. I had the period talk with my daughter before she got her period so she would be prepared. Other than that, there\u2019s absolutely nothing special about our periods to warrant special \u201cmom\u201d time!", "NTA. He needs to deal with this. You shouldn't have had to deal with any of this.", "NTA but please make sure that your stepdaughter isn\u2019t left feeling like she did something wrong if you don\u2019t spend time alone with her anymore.", "NTA, you did what you had to when the child was in your care!

The ex wife was a nightmare and my friends ex never stood up for her because of the same reason your boyfriend mentioned\u2026 freaking ridiculous. I would really question whether you want to deal with this for the rest of your life.", "NTA. I'm sure in that moment the main thing was taking care of the child. Having the child call her mom once the situation was under control would have been nice. The mom was livid bc she missed a pivotal moment in her child's life. This happens when parents go their separate ways. She'll be okay. And definitely don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable going forward.", "NTA ffs.\n\nYou supported a child in your care with what could have been a potentially traumatising moment (my mother thought she was dying because menstruation was never spoken about) \n\nAs the mother of two biologically female children I explained to my kids about their periods, how/why menstruation happens and provided them with kits to have with them if they started away from home.\n\nThere\u2019s no magical ceremony for what is a biological process that most people with a female system go through. \n\nThe mother needs to get over herself and should appreciate that her child had a supportive adult to help her through.

But with an YTA to mom for her reaction. \n\nFor quick context, I have been a stepchild and stepmom. I have an adult daughter and went through a loosely similar situation when it came to a toxic ex causing problems due to how they chose to respond to an innocent situation that wasn't anyone's fault. \n\nI don't think you did anything wrong with helping your stepdaughter. You did the right thing. You would suck/be TA if you choose not to watch your stepdaughter because mom is being difficult. NONE of this is SD's fault. Her parent time should not be affected - regardles of anyone's schedules - because mom got upset. \n\nI get where you're coming from, not wanting to be involved with the ire of a difficult or unreasonable ex. And it's not SD's fault. She will ultimately be the one paying the price for your comfort. \n\nFrom mom's standpoint, this is an event moms want to be involved in. Some very much so. As a divorced parent with other women coming into my daughter's life, I can empathize with the fear of moments being lost or taken away. This, however, is something mom needs to deal with herself. Those fears are not your job to handle, your fiance, or this child. Mom is making it everyone's fault. This is why she sucks with a dose of asshole. \n\nYour fiance/dad sucks because he didn't support you and gave into mom. Sometimes, it is easier to give in. This was a \"battle\" he needed to pick.\n\nHow this all happened is due to a lack of communication between all the adults in SD's life. Period. Y'all know when puberty hits and what happens for young women. Yet no one talked about how to handle that when the day arrives. You, as stepmom, can absolutely help, and you have to abide by mom's wishes. To a point. If you have to intervene like you did, then yes, you should absolutely call.\n\nThis is why I say ESH. No one talked about this day and how to handle it, if it happened at dad's. My daughter's happened just before going to her dad's and I abided by my daughters wishes to not say anything. I sent her with supplies, but with laundry, my ex found out and was upset. Because he is an unreasonable person, he was a level of upset, which was unnecessary. There were no bad intentions on my part or yours. You and I did what we thought was best, but it was misguided. \n\nWhat should happen is for you and your fiance to set up a group call to mom and apologize. Even if she refuses to apologize for her part, you both will have to be the bigger person here. Make the agenda to discuss what important life moments mom wants to be a part of. Like bra shopping, for example. Maybe there aren't any more left till she's older. What clearly needs to happen is creating some boundaries and guidelines around what needs to be shared between the three of you. Establishing boundaries around moments, which are unavoidable and not being angry at the other, and instead recognizing the love and care given to SD. Y'all need to talk. \n\nEven though I feel everyone had their part in this, I still want to point out what an amazing job you did. It may sound ridiculous, but so many children have stepparents in their lives who don't care. Who wouldn't have done this. This child is lucky. Even if mom doesn't see it or wants to ignore  it.

One is the adults and their lack of communication, which led to the whole fiasco, despite OP doing the right thing in the moment. AND, at the same time, OP saying she doesn't want to watch the child and now mess with parent time and what is likely a consistent routine the child has come to expect because the adults can't be adults with each other. 1000x's not the child's fault.

This isn't just some term or label to toss around. \n\nIf OP and fiance we're dating and/or living together and not taking active steps to blend their lives together, I would be in complete agreement. \n\nI agree that if dad were single, other arrangements would need to be made. But he isn't, is he? And he isn't just dating or living with his girlfriend. They are taking steps to legally recognize their union and be an equally responsible participant in each other's lives. This includes the child. It will no longer be only dad's responsibility. I speak from experience as both.\n\nIf OP and her fiance have a child together, then what? Is that when the SD is now applicable because of a half sibling? Where is the line? For me, personally, once you agree to marry, you are accepting everything that includes. Everything.

Not having alone time with your step daughter may lead to more difficulties as she may feel guilty for getting her period whilst with you.

Then OP takes it one step further, suggesting that the child's parent time be affected because mom got mad. Mom should not have gotten mad at OP or dad. She should deal with her feelings of missing out on that moment herself. OP needs to see that she is putting her feelings above the welfare of her SD by refusing to care for SD simply because mom got mad. It all trickles down to lay at the feet of the child. That's who loses in the end. And all because she got her period. See how this works out? This is a multipronged issue. It's not that cut a dry BECAUSE OP put the child's parent time on the chopping block. Had OP not added that to an already shitty situation, then OP would not only not be TA she would also not suck. Everyone sucks because it is the child who ultimately pays the price when all is said and done. \n\nI can't explain anymore beyond this how we so often make children responsible for an adults hurt feelings and poor choices while simultaneously expecting children to behave with more emotional maturity than adults.

OP sucks because she wants to change parent time because bio mom reacted poorly. \n\nI'll say again that societies view on children in the US is disheartening. Repeatedly, people are focusing on the catalyst and not the result. None of the adults handled the situation AFTERWARD well. I don't know how else to explain that to you or anyone else. Moving on now. Thanks for the debate.", "Correct. Which is why I said ESH. This should have been communicated in the first place between the adults. At the end of the day, none of this is that big of deal. It happened. Lesson learned, right? Only OP took it one step further into territory that should be off limits. Changing the child's parent time. \n\nMom didn't respond to the original situation correctly, and now OP isn't either. Dad is bungling everything. But when all the yelling and texting and calling is over, it's the child who will be left holding the bag simply because she got her period. THAT is where and why everybody sucks. \n\nHowever. OP has an opportunity to turn this all around. She can acknowledge mom's feelings. Mom feeling like a moment was taken from her is normal. Divorced parents often have fears of their children loving the stepparent more. That the stepparent will take their place. Unintentionally or not. What bio mom did wrong was take those feelings out on dad and OP. It doesn't stop those feelings from existing. This is where a communication technique comes into play. It's called EAR. Empathy, Assertiveness, and Respect. \n\nEmpathy comes in the way of saying something along the lines of \"I recognize Jane (child) getting her priod was something you wanted to experience with her. It's hard to watch another woman care for your child. I'm sorry I didn't think to call you and discuss what you and I should do for Jane moving forward.\" Yes, it includes an apology. But it's something that goes a long way toward building a bridge that will ultimately support the child in a big way. It can be done without, but it's a stronger olive branch with it. Sometimes, when children are involved, their needs outweigh our ego. \n\nThe assertiveness peice goes, \"When you said X, it made me feel Y. I feel like not watching Jane on Saturdays because I don't want to be made to feel like the bad guy when I tried to do what was best in a situation that couldn't wait.\" She's not groveling or admitting she was wrong with her actions. And she's holding mom accountable for hers. \n\nRespect comes with stating what is needed to move forward positively (though sometimes it does need to be negative, such as a warning). Something like, \"I would like to work with you to parent Jane together and put her needs first. Can you and I get coffee so we can discuss concerns you may have and develop a plan to avoid this situation in the future?\" \n\nIn the end, if bio mom is still unreasonable, OP will have to decide with her fiance how to handle situations at their home and how he will handle bio mom.", "That's excellent.

If this is your experience with divorce lawyers you either live in an area that shouldn't be used as a warning for all fathers everywhere, or you're surrounded by people who get bad, cheap lawyers who haven't brushed up on their homework.", "Its very clear you don\u2019t know the ins and outs of babysitting considering the stance your taking on this topic.\n\nI don\u2019t see your point at all. I\u2019m sorry you think OP should put herself in a position of poor treatment, ridicule, and a lack of advocacy in exchange for her doing a pretty big favor for her BF and his ex wife. Its the parents who need to adjust for the sake of their daughters feelings, not OP.", "It\u2019s so varied, I don\u2019t get cramps every month but occasionally I get some so bad it takes 3 or 4 ibuprofen to feel better", "And that\u2019s why this subreddit is as toxic as the political system. If you can\u2019t see someone else\u2019s point of view, how do you know yours has merit? It\u2019s myopic.", "Im aware of your point of view, Ive heard your point of view. Im not hear clasping my ears and ignoring what you have to say. \nThat said, I do not see it as a valid point of view. Your point is that someone should be guilt tripled into continuing int to babysit while being verbally ridiculed and demeaned by the mother of that child. That is not a valid take. Its terrible. \n\nMine has merit because I am not arguing for someone to he treated cruel in exchange for their kind deed. Its hilarious how any time someone on heres opinion is blatantly wrong, the go to line is always \u201cmust be this toxic subreddit"]}
