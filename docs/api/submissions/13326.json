I found out my father wasn't my biological father, that my mother had been married, widowed while pregnant with me and that she severed all contact from my biological father's family, met my father, married him and they agreed never to tell me the truth. I only found this out because my maternal grandmother had me go through some old stuff at her house and I found photos and documents. I confronted my mother. She told me it didn't matter and to leave it be. I confronted her and my father. They told me what I learned changed nothing and to forget about it. I demanded they tell me the truth. So I got a story. She never said anything bad about my biological father or his family. Only she felt it was best to move on, and to let my father be the only father I knew about. She didn't want him to be my step anything, she didn't want me to ever feel like I was anything less than his. She told me I was never my biological father's child. That she had loved him but he was the past, he was in the ground and his family had no right to stay in my life. My father told me he wanted me to leave it there and not seek out my biological family. I told them I didn't want anything to do with them again.\n\nWe were no contact for two years (my choice). I was able to find my biological father's family. They were so happy I reached out. They showed me how they had looked for my mother and for me. My mother's family admitted she told them and everyone she knew not to tell them anything about her life and to never share where we were. I got to know them and they became my family. It hasn't always been easy. They have so much grief that they never got to know me growing up, and I feel it too, as well as how robbed I feel that I never got to know about my biological father. I look just like him and I always wondered why I looked so different from the rest of my family. I also found out my father had set money aside for me over the weeks he knew my mother was pregnant.\n\nAbout a year ago some contact was reinstated between me and my parents. I haven't forgiven them and it's not easy to speak to them. They did learn recently just how involved my father's family is now and how I have my biological relatives around. They don't like this. My mother decided to ask about the future, my wedding, etc and said I can't have both there. I told her if she wants to be there she'd need to accept that my family will be. She told me I am choosing someone I never knew over loving parents. She also told me I was HER child. I told her to fuck off and told her she doesn't get to decide what I do with my life anymore.

I'm so sorry you missed out on knowing what you should have know.\n\nIf your mom insists on you choosing, simply say that your dad's family will be at your important events and if she decideds to make you choose, she's the one who gets left off the guest list because she had you all to herself growing up due to her lies.", "> She also told me I was HER child\n\nShe didn't go to a sperm bank.

Hopefully you and your mom and dad can find a way to become family again, but they need to understand how all of this is affecting you.", "NTA.

You have handled all of this incredibly well considering the shock you must have felt.  I\u2019m so sorry, OP.

Sorry you're having to deal with this maelstrom.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry you never got to meet your bio father. Now being close to the other family has given some closure. Shame on your mother for not accepting your happiness.", "NTA. You have the right to know your biological father's family and to be close to them. It seems like your mom can't deal with the trauma she went through losing your biological dad so she wants to pretend it didn't happen - hopefully over time she will be able to handle this better. Its sad that she's trying to force you to choose - but that's her. You want all the sides of your family - she's the one making it difficult.

You're really young and you are doing an amazing job of navigating this situation!", "NTA. Wow. That's some spheres she has, after all this, trying to tell you who you can have and not have at your wedding.

What's real.\n\nShe needs to understand that your feelings are yours. It doesn't matter what she thinks about why she did it, she can say whatever she wants, at the end of the day, you're feeling hurt and confused and betrayed, and she does not get to decide if that is right, wrong or otherwise. You feel that way, period.\n\nNTA at all, like I said, even if they were good people and good parents, they deprived you of knowing your dad's family, your grandparents, your cousins. As someone who is extremely close with my cousins (and was with my grandpa, RIP), I feel for you. I don't know who I'd even be without my one cousin in particular in my life. We were born 8 days apart, we've been friends since birth, I am probably closer with him than my actual siblings!", "NTA - I am sorry that the way your mom and dad that raised you are handling things in this way.  Part of me understands your mom's thinking for her original choice.  I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been to be pregnant and lose my spouse.  Then she found someone who would accept and raise you as his own.  I imagine that your mom must have felt incredibly lucky to be able to give you the life she wanted, with two parents who loved you.  That being said, it was wrong for them to make you feel like reaching out to your bio dad's family was wrong.  They should have been supportive of you.  You aren't wrong that your mother doesn't get to make the choices in your life anymore, but it also sounds like your mom thought she was doing what was best, even if it was the wrong choice for you.  Consider telling your mom and dad that raised you that you love them, and that they were good parents.  Let them know that having a relationship with your bio dad's family doesn't change the things they did for you growing up, but it just expands the family and love you have in your life.  Tell them it is your choice on who you have relationships with, and that includes them.", "NTA - This is such a heartbreaking situation. Obviously, your mom is being outrageously unreasonable here. I could almost have understood the initial lying as a misguided attempt to protect you, especially if your family had been toxic or horrible. But based on her reaction when you found out, and the fact that your family appears to be great and full of love, it seems like the reason she gave to you wasn\u2019t the real reason she lied.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You shouldn\u2019t have to make this choice and it\u2019s awful that your mom is putting you in this situation.", "NTA. Playing devil's advocate, I can maybe understand why she wanted to move on.

Shame on her for giving you the ultimatum of her or them.\n\nBut there is still obvious anger there.  You are right.  You get to choose.

It's not clear why she's so against your biological father. Did he abuse her? Did he hurt her? Why is she so adamant to erase him to the point where it doesn't sound like she even mourned him? Was she left in a financially precarious position at your bio dad's death and so had to ensure that this new guy felt prioritised so she, and you, can be taken care of? Is she financially independent or dependent on your stepdad? If she's dependent on your stepdad it'd stand to reason why can't ever stand by your side even tho u do deserve to know your background. It's not only about names and identity but also because of medical histories. If you plan to have children in the future, it'd be important for you to know your paternal medical histories going forward. Plus, in your case, your paternal families sound like supportive people. This is a great extended family and support system for you and your potential future children. It's unfair for you to be isolated from that.\n\nFor your peace, it's important to know why she is the way she is towards your bio dad and whether she has any agency to stand by your side in your quest.

It's teasing that doesn't make sense, but somehow that bloodline matters to children enough that it can hurt them. Apparently it matters a lot to you too. Your parents, incorrectly, tried to protect that. It was the wrong choice from the beginning bc your bio dad didn't up and leave, he died.  Also cutting off your bio family was a dick move on your moms part since to them, you were a piece of him left. But to her, they were just a reminder of the pain.

The donor egg/sperm situation is more closely related to OP's actual family situation though, based on facts alone - their father passed just after impregnation and they never knew them. They were raised by another person with no genetic connection to the kid, just an emotional connection with the mother, and while they might have had a closer emotional connection in their family unit as OP was growing up, lying to kids for decades does a number on the trust in the family unit. It's always better to have age appropriate conversations about where kids come from than it is to outright lie and claim that other people shouldn't matter to them. \n\nIn a donor egg or sperm situation, those kids are also missing out on half their biological family and don't have the ability to consent to being brought into this world with no connection to those folks. Their parents sign away their rights for them to search for their sperm donor and sign consent forms claiming the child will never do a DNA test to track down who their donors are.

He loved you as your father and didn't treat you any less than his daughter. Your mom also likely made her decision in a dark and chaotic time for her, and it may have been easier for her to deal with everything by stopping contact with his family.

There are so many kids that only ever dreamed of having that. Not just one, but two active, stable, and healthy consistent parents that were always there. But because of your hurt and anger over their lie, as well as what seems like a defensive and insecure response to your relationship with his family from your mom, you want to cut them from your life and have no respect or appreciation for the love and life they've given you. \n\nAgain, they were wrong for lying, and for the reaction to your relationship with his family.

Here we are with a mother and step parent actually achieving erasure and being very smug about it too. Even in adulthood they are still trying to erase your father and his family from your life.

They are not the least bit remorseful.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is being selfish and controlling.\n\nMaybe she just wanted to move on with her life after your father passed and maybe contact with his family was too painful for her, but that's a choice she made by herself, for herself, without considering anyone else. Not considering your grandparents and other extended family, and not considering you.\n\nMaybe your father's family was pressuring her about the pregnancy and trying to control her after he passed, but you have no way of knowing that because she has refused to talk to you about any of this until forced, so all you can know is what she's done and how she's behaving. And it doesn't look good for her.\n\nIt's  not her right to dictate to you what is important to you, or who you can and can't have a relationship with.

NTA.\n\nThis is something that probably isn't illegal, but extremely immoral.  Yes, she had final jurisdiction and if, for instance, she had moved for your Dad and then wanted to move back to her support system under the circumstances, they should have no right to stop her as sad as it might be.  But to cut off grieving parents - which by the way, is worse than losing a spouse even though they're no longer next of kin - from the only piece of their child left not because they're toxic, but simply because they don't want the inconvenience of facilitating contact, is beyond cruel.

OP needs to know where they comes from.  One of the biggest mistakes adoptive parents make is to change the child's name, frequently to something that aligns with the adoptive parent's ethnicity or culture.

It says, \"there is something wrong with you, so we have to fix it.\" \n\nOP's parents rejected a part of them when they denied them the truth about their bio-dad.

Some lady posted asking if she was wrong to tell her niece the truth. The truth was that lady had 2 sisters and one sister got ill from cancer and the other sister started an affair with the ill sister's husband (BIL), and ill sister and BIL had niece together. When ill sister died, other sister and BIL got together and made everyone swear never to tell niece about her mother or they'll cut contact completely and no one will have access to niece. So the lady never spoke to niece. Other sister and BIL destroyed everything belonging to ill sister to wipe all traces of her, who wrote notes and made videos for all the milestones niece would experience. But the lady had some copies of that stuff. Niece contacted the lady and wanted career advice but also why she never spoke to niece. Lady told her the whole truth and showed videos and stuff of her ill mother. She confronted and went no contact when they showed no remorse. So you're not alone in your feelings of betrayal. Continue in therapy and if they keep harassing you, talk to your therapist about what is the best course of action. If permanent NC is the way to go, then do that for yourself.
