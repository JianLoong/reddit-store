I found out my father wasn't my biological father, that my mother had been married, widowed while pregnant with me and that she severed all contact from my biological father's family, met my father, married him and they agreed never to tell me the truth. I only found this out because my maternal grandmother had me go through some old stuff at her house and I found photos and documents. I confronted my mother. She told me it didn't matter and to leave it be. I confronted her and my father. They told me what I learned changed nothing and to forget about it. I demanded they tell me the truth. So I got a story. She never said anything bad about my biological father or his family. Only she felt it was best to move on, and to let my father be the only father I knew about. She didn't want him to be my step anything, she didn't want me to ever feel like I was anything less than his. She told me I was never my biological father's child. That she had loved him but he was the past, he was in the ground and his family had no right to stay in my life. My father told me he wanted me to leave it there and not seek out my biological family. I told them I didn't want anything to do with them again.\n\nWe were no contact for two years (my choice). I was able to find my biological father's family. They were so happy I reached out. They showed me how they had looked for my mother and for me. My mother's family admitted she told them and everyone she knew not to tell them anything about her life and to never share where we were. I got to know them and they became my family. It hasn't always been easy. They have so much grief that they never got to know me growing up, and I feel it too, as well as how robbed I feel that I never got to know about my biological father. I look just like him and I always wondered why I looked so different from the rest of my family. I also found out my father had set money aside for me over the weeks he knew my mother was pregnant.\n\nAbout a year ago some contact was reinstated between me and my parents. I haven't forgiven them and it's not easy to speak to them. They did learn recently just how involved my father's family is now and how I have my biological relatives around. They don't like this. My mother decided to ask about the future, my wedding, etc and said I can't have both there. I told her if she wants to be there she'd need to accept that my family will be. She told me I am choosing someone I never knew over loving parents. She also told me I was HER child. I told her to fuck off and told her she doesn't get to decide what I do with my life anymore.

It seems like your mom can't deal with the trauma she went through losing your biological dad so she wants to pretend it didn't happen - hopefully over time she will be able to handle this better. Its sad that she's trying to force you to choose - but that's her. You want all the sides of your family - she's the one making it difficult.

You feel that way, period.\n\nNTA at all, like I said, even if they were good people and good parents, they deprived you of knowing your dad's family, your grandparents, your cousins. As someone who is extremely close with my cousins (and was with my grandpa, RIP), I feel for you. I don't know who I'd even be without my one cousin in particular in my life.

Part of me understands your mom's thinking for her original choice.  I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been to be pregnant and lose my spouse.  Then she found someone who would accept and raise you as his own.  I imagine that your mom must have felt incredibly lucky to be able to give you the life she wanted, with two parents who loved you.  That being said, it was wrong for them to make you feel like reaching out to your bio dad's family was wrong.  They should have been supportive of you.  You aren't wrong that your mother doesn't get to make the choices in your life anymore, but it also sounds like your mom thought she was doing what was best, even if it was the wrong choice for you.  Consider telling your mom and dad that raised you that you love them, and that they were good parents.  Let them know that having a relationship with your bio dad's family doesn't change the things they did for you growing up, but it just expands the family and love you have in your life.  Tell them it is your choice on who you have relationships with, and that includes them.", "NTA - This is such a heartbreaking situation. Obviously, your mom is being outrageously unreasonable here. I could almost have understood the initial lying as a misguided attempt to protect you, especially if your family had been toxic or horrible. But based on her reaction when you found out, and the fact that your family appears to be great and full of love, it seems like the reason she gave to you wasn\u2019t the real reason she lied.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You shouldn\u2019t have to make this choice and it\u2019s awful that your mom is putting you in this situation.", "NTA. Playing devil's advocate, I can maybe understand why she wanted to move on.

It's not clear why she's so against your biological father. Did he abuse her? Did he hurt her? Why is she so adamant to erase him to the point where it doesn't sound like she even mourned him? Was she left in a financially precarious position at your bio dad's death and so had to ensure that this new guy felt prioritised so she, and you, can be taken care of? Is she financially independent or dependent on your stepdad? If she's dependent on your stepdad it'd stand to reason why can't ever stand by your side even tho u do deserve to know your background. It's not only about names and identity but also because of medical histories. If you plan to have children in the future, it'd be important for you to know your paternal medical histories going forward. Plus, in your case, your paternal families sound like supportive people. This is a great extended family and support system for you and your potential future children. It's unfair for you to be isolated from that.\n\nFor your peace, it's important to know why she is the way she is towards your bio dad and whether she has any agency to stand by your side in your quest.

It's teasing that doesn't make sense, but somehow that bloodline matters to children enough that it can hurt them. Apparently it matters a lot to you too. Your parents, incorrectly, tried to protect that. It was the wrong choice from the beginning bc your bio dad didn't up and leave, he died.  Also cutting off your bio family was a dick move on your moms part since to them, you were a piece of him left. But to her, they were just a reminder of the pain.

The donor egg/sperm situation is more closely related to OP's actual family situation though, based on facts alone - their father passed just after impregnation and they never knew them. They were raised by another person with no genetic connection to the kid, just an emotional connection with the mother, and while they might have had a closer emotional connection in their family unit as OP was growing up, lying to kids for decades does a number on the trust in the family unit. It's always better to have age appropriate conversations about where kids come from than it is to outright lie and claim that other people shouldn't matter to them. \n\nIn a donor egg or sperm situation, those kids are also missing out on half their biological family and don't have the ability to consent to being brought into this world with no connection to those folks.

There are so many kids that only ever dreamed of having that. Not just one, but two active, stable, and healthy consistent parents that were always there.

It wasn\u2019t fair to cut people out without your consent. I had people in my life that were call \u2018uncle\u2019 and \u2018aunt\u2019 and when I reached the age that I not only thought it through fully but was curious enough to question how they were related to me since they were not siblings to my mum she decided that was a good indication that I was ready to have some background explained. She has no right to tell you who can or cannot be part of your future though and her reaction to all this is awful, fighting you rather than supporting you makes no sense! NTA", "NTA. she put your life at risk. I work in the medical field and it\u2019s extremely important to have an accurate family history. Not all illnesses are purely genetic but many have hereditary components. Everyone has a right to know that kind of information as it is super relevant to your life and your health", "NTA, I think your mother is one of the worst human beings I've heard about in a long... time. I'm sorry that you were cursed by such a person in your life, but I am glad  to hear you have connected with your paternal family.", "NTA and if she thinks you\u2019re being petty show her real pettiness when you finish cutting them out by saying \u201cI want to include my family in the rest of my life because I\u2019ve lost too much of it already to an egg donor and the kidnapper she married\u201d.", "NTA. You have a right to know. Edit: as someone who was adopted I loathe that line. You are your own person and deserve to seek out your father\u2019s family and have that relationship, just because she severed that tie does not mean you have to as well and it\u2019s selfish of her to expect you to do the same. Best of luck.", "NTA your mom doesn\u2019t own you, she doesn\u2019t decide who gets to be in your life. You may be her child but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re her god damn property.", "NTA\n\nGo NC. Tell her off again to boot.", "In anything but the pettiest of circumstances, \"petulant\" is the last resort of someone who knows they fucked up but don't want to acknowledge it, so will try to put the blame on you.  It's the same as complaining about your tone to avoid interacting with your words.\n\nNTA.  She wanted to cut them out of your life once, and now you've undone that.  Trying to do it again and hoping it sticks is bullshit, and if she can't accept that then she should cut herself out.", "NTA\n\n\"Fuck off\" was not necessary to get the point across.\n\nThree things:\n\n1. Not telling you about your bio-dad was part of how they raised you.  If they raised you with shelter and love, and provided tools for success for you, and supported you, give them credit for that.  It sounds like they DO love you, yet they made what has amounted to a huge mistake.\n2. This was their decision long ago, was a long-held policy, and clearly a very firm habit.  Changing the way they have lived their life, and admitting their decision was perhaps deeply flawed, is probably not easy.\n3. Your Mom and Step-dad need to get with the program NOW.  You found out, turns out it IS really important to you, and your bio-Dad's family missed you and welcomes you. Now Mom and Step-Dad STILL need to love and support you.  It is time for them to apologize, reform their ways, and mend fences as much as possible.  Your Mom's bit about \"CAN'T have both families at a wedding or in your future\" is utter crap.\n\nGood luck, I hope you get the best of both worlds.", "NTA\n\nNeither of your parents were loving. They prevented you from knowing and being able to get to know family that could have told you about your father. \n\nShe cut you off from part of your culture and expects you to accept it and move on knowing you grew up noticing the difference.", "She robbed her child of love! You are NTA.", "NTA, but I think your mother had good intentions. \n\nAs Robert Burns wrote \u2014\n\n\u201cThe best-laid schemes o' mice an' men\nGang aft agley\u201d. \n\nYour mother had plans and hopes and didn\u2019t think beyond them. \n\nI hope this has a happy resolution in time.", "NTA your parents handled it completely wrong. My mom passed away when I was 2 years old so I didn't have any memories of her and my family never tried to hide it or anything, they were always open about it. I call my step mother \"mom\" because its the only mom that I know and I still have a great relationship with my biological mothers side of the family as well.", "NTA", "Yo mama has some sort of disorder that has not been addressed. NTA", "NTA. In fact, you are quite literally the furthest you could possibly be from the asshole in this situation. I was also adopted by my father (when I was 2 or 3) and was never told (until my sperm donor reached out to me over Facebook messenger) so I know how that feels. I will never forgive my dad for putting his wants for me not to feel like any way I was treated differently than my siblings was because I'm not biologically related to him, over my right to know who I was and my history. However way you are processing and dealing with this is absolutely valid and I hope you are doing okay. The way your mother has treated you is inexcusable, and I am truly wishing you the best.", "NTA- Jesus\u2026. I can completely empathize with your moms decision to  raise you believing that your bio dad didn\u2019t exist. But the sheer amount of gull she has to do anything other than beg for your forgiveness after you found out is frankly mind boggling. And to compound her arrogance she has the nerve to call you petulant. Look OP if all else is equal and you still love your parents I\u2019d say try giving family therapy a shot, maybe if a complete stranger (the therapist) holds up a mirror to your mom she will realize her awful mistake.   Other thank that best of luck with your bio dads family I\u2019m glad you could find them and they were so eager to welcome you.", "Time to go NC again", "I can see where the mom is coming from with the step thing because of the multiple number of stories I have read where kids have no love or like for the step family, that being said I would have after relationships are formed have come clean when said kid is old enough to understand it all so I will say NTA here and I don't condone it but I understand.", "Definitely NTA there were no signs of abuse from your biological father and \"I felt it was best to move on.\" is a terrible reason you  have every right to be annoyed, angry, etc.  I  could be wrong and stupid but your mom is definitely the asshole here for me.", "NTA, but your mom...is a selfish cow. I'm sorry to say anyone's mom is such a thing, but, it is what it is. I don't blame you one bit for cutting her off and getting on with your life. A pair of \"loving parents\" wouldn't have been so brash and cruel to your bio father's family, and lie to you your entire life. \n\nThen, to top it all off, expects you to cut these people out that you've come to love? Incredibly selfish and toxic. You're better off with the family you choose to build.", "NTA. But I feel that there is more to this story. \n\nSomething similar happened to a distant relative. She got widowed when she was pregnant. But she did tell her daughter about everything. Daughter never got along with the step dad. Then, the in-laws side started reaching out to said daughter pretending to have her best in heart. They kind of worked her up saying that she is the sole heir to her father\u2019s inheritance and that her mother was robbing her off it. That her mother would also never allow her to marry that older divorced man with a kid whom the young daughter liked. The daughter was 18-ish then. It was a catastrophe. The daughter SUED her mother. Her mum and stepdad and half brother all got kicked out of their house and basically everything was taken away (they eventually moved to the US long term). Daughter took everything and went off to marry the divorcee.\n\nDaughter got shunned from EVERYONE. Literally no one talked about her up until recently. She got back in touch with her mum. Got to know that the husband\u2019s mother is VERY strict on her. They live in India so living together in a joint family. Other relatives saw her at her half brother\u2019s wedding. Said she looks WAY older than her age and not very happy. Those relatives that egged her to sue her mother leeched off her. She doesn\u2019t own that big house either anymore that she had forced her parents and brother out of. Not sure whatever happened to the wealth of her biological dad. \n\nI am only sharing this story for you to be careful. You have grown up with your parents. You know them better than everyone on this thread. Be slightly careful of these new relations and relatives. I sincerely hope they have your best interests in their hearts. This world is just not a trustable place as you may have noticed by what you\u2019re finding out now.", "NTA.\n\nWhile your mum and step-dad wants you to have nothing to do with your biological father's side of family, they have no right to do so.\n\nWhether or not you want them (biological father's side) to be in your life, is totally up to you. They should not have taken that choice from you.", "NTA Sorry your Mom did this to you.", "Did your mom ever explain why she cut all contact w/your father\u2019s family? How her marriage w/your father was, and what her relationship with his family was? \nThose are all very important factors. \nYou don\u2019t say how old you are\u2026", "based on the info in your post YTA. It\u2019s sounds like your mom had good reason to keep you from that family. I don\u2019t know the deal w your bio dad but she went to extreme efforts to hide from his fam which makes me pause to wonder why. Maybe she was scared of them, idk. And by the way, the people who raise you are your parents. Making a baby does not a parent make if you know what I mean. Go to therapy pls", "NTA\n\nDo you know what? I could see where your mum was coming from, right up until the wedding nonsense. She's pregnant, shocked, grieving. Had a fantasy of a picture perfect family taken away, and in the midst of her sorrow made some poor choices to hang on to the dream...\nBut then the shit hit the fan. You found out the truth and understandably went bananas. And went off on your own and found out where you came from. It's done. Can't un-ring a bell. She should be trying to get her head around what the family is now. Not what she tried to make it all those years ago", "My mom had actually done something similar but she did it for a good reason. Although my mom didn't lie about them and was honest with me about why I haven't met them yet. I was allowed to meet them at 16 and yeah. Mom you're right lol.", "Agreed. What made me raise an eyebrow was that the father \u201cput money away\u201d for the child when the mom was pregnant\u2026.if they were together why would he do that? Wouldn\u2019t the mom have it, since they were married? Or get it/find it when he died? Why would his family have it?  The OP is old enough to know the truth, all of it, and I feel like there\u2019s something that\u2019s been left out.", "There is.", "She also robbed you of vital family health history information. Robbed you of knowing about any genetic illnesses and conditions passed down by your biological father. Maybe throw that in her face, that there could be a ticking time-bomb like genetically induced aneurysms, those can be fatal. NTA at all", "Info\n\nDid he act as a real father in your life and is he less of a father to you now?\n\nDoes his sides of family never treated you as family?", "The way your daughter treats you will be very much based on how your relationship is while she's growing up. If she asks, I would say the easiest way is to answer honestly and simply. \"Is dad my real dad\" could be answered with \"Yes, because he's raised you.\" Then, if she asks any other question, like \"Why does he look different from me\" you could say \"because he's got different genes than you\" or some other simple thing, as long as you don't hide the fact that they're not genetically related. As she gets older, she'll ask more questions, or she won't. Just let her lead the way with her own questions as she has them, and tell her the truth, as simply as you can.\n\nI think op's dilemma is mostly because the biomom didn't allow her to know the truth, or to know the other part of her biofamily. This gets shown when the dad also asks her not to look up the rest of her relatives too. Op should be allowed to make her own choices, and they're trying to prevent that every step of the way.", "They're trying to make ultimatums to cut the paternal family out at this point in time.  They are explicitly trying to stop OP from spending time with them, so yes, they are wrong in expressing how they feel, because that expression is actually a demand.", "That's where they are overstepping. I agree on that. Expressing once or twice is fair. Constantly shoving it down OP's throat isn't. Yes, it might be absolutely awkward for the parents but that's something they need to get over.", "It seems like you're taking OP's very reasonable response to their parents lying to them their entire life, then demanding that even after the lie was exposed, OP act like they want and cut out the paternal family, as a personal attack on you because you were also adopted.  \n\nThis thread isn't about you, so why are you repeatedly demanding that OP adhere to how you would respond?  You're not the main character.", "And that appears to be exactly OP's position.  If they can't comply with it, that's their problem.\n\nThe \"You're MY child\" really grates on my nerves, because it makes so clear that it's not actually about OP's wellbeing, it's purely about the mom's wants.", "\"Have you considered this imaginary scenario I pulled directly out of my ass?  Bet THAT changes your mind!\"\n\nIt's amazing how people will bend over backwards to invent excuses out of literally nothing when they don't find anything in the post to back up what they want the answer to be.", "Her mom isn't atoning for her \"mistake,\" she's trying to repeat it and hope it works this time.  She's demanding OP cut the paternal family out again.  So no, it's not \"ooo she made a bad choice after a terrible tragedy and just didn't want to hurt you,\" she's had plenty of time to meditate on that choice and went \"nah, I was right.\""]}
