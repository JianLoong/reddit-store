I found out my father wasn't my biological father, that my mother had been married, widowed while pregnant with me and that she severed all contact from my biological father's family, met my father, married him and they agreed never to tell me the truth. I only found this out because my maternal grandmother had me go through some old stuff at her house and I found photos and documents. I confronted my mother. She told me it didn't matter and to leave it be. I confronted her and my father. They told me what I learned changed nothing and to forget about it. I demanded they tell me the truth. So I got a story. She never said anything bad about my biological father or his family. Only she felt it was best to move on, and to let my father be the only father I knew about. She didn't want him to be my step anything, she didn't want me to ever feel like I was anything less than his. She told me I was never my biological father's child. That she had loved him but he was the past, he was in the ground and his family had no right to stay in my life. My father told me he wanted me to leave it there and not seek out my biological family. I told them I didn't want anything to do with them again.\n\nWe were no contact for two years (my choice). I was able to find my biological father's family. They were so happy I reached out. They showed me how they had looked for my mother and for me. My mother's family admitted she told them and everyone she knew not to tell them anything about her life and to never share where we were. I got to know them and they became my family. It hasn't always been easy. They have so much grief that they never got to know me growing up, and I feel it too, as well as how robbed I feel that I never got to know about my biological father. I look just like him and I always wondered why I looked so different from the rest of my family. I also found out my father had set money aside for me over the weeks he knew my mother was pregnant.\n\nAbout a year ago some contact was reinstated between me and my parents. I haven't forgiven them and it's not easy to speak to them. They did learn recently just how involved my father's family is now and how I have my biological relatives around. They don't like this. My mother decided to ask about the future, my wedding, etc and said I can't have both there. I told her if she wants to be there she'd need to accept that my family will be. She told me I am choosing someone I never knew over loving parents. She also told me I was HER child. I told her to fuck off and told her she doesn't get to decide what I do with my life anymore.

I'm so sorry you missed out on knowing what you should have know.\n\nIf your mom insists on you choosing, simply say that your dad's family will be at your important events and if she decideds to make you choose, she's the one who gets left off the guest list because she had you all to herself growing up due to her lies.", "> She also told me I was HER child\n\nShe didn't go to a sperm bank.

Hopefully you and your mom and dad can find a way to become family again, but they need to understand how all of this is affecting you.", "NTA.

You have handled all of this incredibly well considering the shock you must have felt.  I\u2019m so sorry, OP.

Sorry you're having to deal with this maelstrom.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry you never got to meet your bio father. Now being close to the other family has given some closure. Shame on your mother for not accepting your happiness.", "NTA. You have the right to know your biological father's family and to be close to them. It seems like your mom can't deal with the trauma she went through losing your biological dad so she wants to pretend it didn't happen - hopefully over time she will be able to handle this better. Its sad that she's trying to force you to choose - but that's her. You want all the sides of your family - she's the one making it difficult.

You're really young and you are doing an amazing job of navigating this situation!", "NTA. Wow. That's some spheres she has, after all this, trying to tell you who you can have and not have at your wedding.

What's real.\n\nShe needs to understand that your feelings are yours. It doesn't matter what she thinks about why she did it, she can say whatever she wants, at the end of the day, you're feeling hurt and confused and betrayed, and she does not get to decide if that is right, wrong or otherwise. You feel that way, period.\n\nNTA at all, like I said, even if they were good people and good parents, they deprived you of knowing your dad's family, your grandparents, your cousins. As someone who is extremely close with my cousins (and was with my grandpa, RIP), I feel for you. I don't know who I'd even be without my one cousin in particular in my life. We were born 8 days apart, we've been friends since birth, I am probably closer with him than my actual siblings!", "NTA - I am sorry that the way your mom and dad that raised you are handling things in this way.  Part of me understands your mom's thinking for her original choice.  I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been to be pregnant and lose my spouse.  Then she found someone who would accept and raise you as his own.  I imagine that your mom must have felt incredibly lucky to be able to give you the life she wanted, with two parents who loved you.  That being said, it was wrong for them to make you feel like reaching out to your bio dad's family was wrong.  They should have been supportive of you.  You aren't wrong that your mother doesn't get to make the choices in your life anymore, but it also sounds like your mom thought she was doing what was best, even if it was the wrong choice for you.  Consider telling your mom and dad that raised you that you love them, and that they were good parents.  Let them know that having a relationship with your bio dad's family doesn't change the things they did for you growing up, but it just expands the family and love you have in your life.  Tell them it is your choice on who you have relationships with, and that includes them.", "NTA - This is such a heartbreaking situation. Obviously, your mom is being outrageously unreasonable here. I could almost have understood the initial lying as a misguided attempt to protect you, especially if your family had been toxic or horrible. But based on her reaction when you found out, and the fact that your family appears to be great and full of love, it seems like the reason she gave to you wasn\u2019t the real reason she lied.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You shouldn\u2019t have to make this choice and it\u2019s awful that your mom is putting you in this situation.", "NTA. Playing devil's advocate, I can maybe understand why she wanted to move on.

Shame on her for giving you the ultimatum of her or them.\n\nBut there is still obvious anger there.  You are right.  You get to choose.

It's not clear why she's so against your biological father. Did he abuse her? Did he hurt her? Why is she so adamant to erase him to the point where it doesn't sound like she even mourned him? Was she left in a financially precarious position at your bio dad's death and so had to ensure that this new guy felt prioritised so she, and you, can be taken care of? Is she financially independent or dependent on your stepdad? If she's dependent on your stepdad it'd stand to reason why can't ever stand by your side even tho u do deserve to know your background. It's not only about names and identity but also because of medical histories. If you plan to have children in the future, it'd be important for you to know your paternal medical histories going forward. Plus, in your case, your paternal families sound like supportive people. This is a great extended family and support system for you and your potential future children. It's unfair for you to be isolated from that.\n\nFor your peace, it's important to know why she is the way she is towards your bio dad and whether she has any agency to stand by your side in your quest.

It's teasing that doesn't make sense, but somehow that bloodline matters to children enough that it can hurt them. Apparently it matters a lot to you too. Your parents, incorrectly, tried to protect that. It was the wrong choice from the beginning bc your bio dad didn't up and leave, he died.  Also cutting off your bio family was a dick move on your moms part since to them, you were a piece of him left. But to her, they were just a reminder of the pain.

Seeing the family and all the little pieces of the person you loved in them but it not be them is incredibly difficult, and not everyone is emotionally resilient to deal with that level of loss. \n\nShe just took the avenue that adoptive and donor parents have been taking for decades until DNA tests started bringing the prevalence of hiding adoptions and fertility issues to light - pretend it doesn't exist, never deal with your feelings that your family isn't the full bio family you dreamed of, and put it on your child to never have a connection with their genetic family by making it out to be a case of you not being enough for them vs you've betrayed your relationship with your child for decades by not being truthful about who they are and where they came from.", "I'm 21 now.", "She wouldn't have. She'd have preferred that I die thinking I was her husband's bio kid than tell the truth.", "This is such an important point. Anyone could raise a child good, but depriving her daughter the chance of knowing her bio-dad is cruel, especially because it is implied he wasn't a bad person in any way", "I don't think she'll ever apologize.

She doesn't believe they had any right to know me or me them.", "I have been in therapy for a while now.", "She wanted a fresh start and wanted me to grow up with just a father. Not with a stepfather. She wanted me to never know I was part of a step anything. And that knowing my biological family would have done that.", "Id agree except they still don\u2019t seem to show proper remorse. I mean it\u2019s impossible to lie to your child for her whole life and then say her family can\u2019t come for her wedding.", "They raised and loved me and then when I found out the truth told me to forget it and not make contact with my biological family. Told me they didn't want me to do it. That I should forget it. That it would be wrong to seek out my own family. I was 18. I was already living independently by then. I had already made it clear it was not the right decision and they still tried to keep me from people who were related to me.", "I'm 21 now", "It wasn't JUST because of that. They told me not to reach out to my biological family and to forget that I had other family out there. They weren't even going to tell me the truth. They would have continued to lie if I hadn't continued to push. Then they try to tell me I can't find my family. That was more what no contact was over.", "There is a difference between a deadbeat dad and a mother literally stealing away his child and never giving him the chance to even be a goos father. \nHer mother never thought about what her daughter wanted only what she and her new one wanted. \nAs OP said, she herself decides who her parents are.\n\nEdit: just realised bio dad is dead, still my point stands there was no reason to cut his family out", "She doesn't view it as a mistake. She views what I have done as a mistake. I think in her eyes the only mistake she made is not making sure all traces of my father were gone. Including at the homes of other family members.", "Can't call my bio father a donor since he didn't choose to die before he could raise me. That's not fair at all.

Seriously?\n\n\"While it's understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed by your mother's actions, resorting to vulgarity and insults is not an appropriate or mature way to handle the situation.\"\n\nSo it's not inappropriate or immature for OP's mother to lie to OP about their parentage for 21 years, but it's suddenly problematic when OP curses her out because of it? \n\n\"It's also important to consider that your parents may have made the decisions they did out of what they believed was best for you at the time, even if it was misguided.\"\n\nOP lost out on 2 decades of connecting to her biological father's family because of one selfish decision on her mother's part. How does that benefit her in any way at all? \n\nYou're also forgetting that OP didn't just tell their mom to f\\*\\*\\* off out of the blue- they did it in the context of an argument that the mother started. She had it coming.", "I tried to talk to my mother and she tried to make me cut out the people she denied to me the first 18 years of my life.", "So, to achieve that end she cut half your family out of your life. That's not a good reason to deny you and them. She sounds wholly selfish - she didn't want to have to deal with them or the idea of \"step\" parenting. Big failure on her part and an incredible missed opportunity.", "My grandma was widowed with 2 kids (my uncle and my mom) when she met my grandpa who already had a kid (my aunt).

My grandpa is my mom\u2019s dad and she doesn\u2019t call him anything different. \u201cStep\u201d isn\u2019t a required term.

The damage done though...wow.\n\nThe biggest difference between this situation and the adoptive/donor parent situation is consent of all parties. The only persons consenting in this situation are OP's mom and step-father.  They made irreversible choices for not just OP but for OP's biological family too. They have caused a huge amount of pain and suffering that simply did not need to happen. I get what you're saying though.\n\nAnd while I personally feel that forgiveness will bring closure to OP, I certainly understand that she's not there yet.

I have always said whomever forces a choice, loses out.\n\nOP is NTA at all. Family secrets are NEVER a good thing. Ever. He (she?) deserved to know the truth as soon as they were old enough. It wouldn't have impacted the dynamic if they had been open about it as they would still have been raised as the 2nd husband's kid.", "Yup, can't blame you for going NC.

Do you know how your biological father died? Perhaps it was traumatic for her? Her reaction to his death suggests to me it was highly traumatic for her and she wanted to move on.\n\nYTA for telling her to \"F*** off\" but your mom is TA for keeping it from you. \n\nYou two need to talk, maybe talk to the man who raised you as well. Try to understand and maybe you can repair all sorts of relationships.", "She has no regrets about it.

That's brutal...", "[deleted]", "Did you have a stable, healthy childhood? Were your mom and stepdad bad or abusive parents?", "This is so sad... I would be heartbroken if I were you and especially if I was your father. I would understand the reasoning if he and his family were really bad people, but in this case, it is quite frankly one of the most abhorrent things she could do... to erase a person like this. How can you claim to have loved someone and then erase every trace of their existence? \nQuite frankly, I think you are being very generous just by having contact with them again. I know I couldn't stomach that if I were you.", "You do realize that sperm donors don\u2019t die after they ejaculate?", "Yep. It was selfish and then they tried to insist I just pretend I didn't know I had a whole other family out there.", " \n\nI think he truly believed that being brave makes your life happy, but that doesn't change the fact that he was, and should be responsible for his mistakes.", ">They made irreversible choices for not just OP but for OP's biological family too.\n\nYeah, that's how it works, kids needs are an oversight in pretty much all family planning situations - it's about creating the family the parents want, not what's in the child's best interest and needs. The donor egg/sperm situation is more closely related to OP's actual family situation though, based on facts alone - their father passed just after impregnation and they never knew them. They were raised by another person with no genetic connection to the kid, just an emotional connection with the mother, and while they might have had a closer emotional connection in their family unit as OP was growing up, lying to kids for decades does a number on the trust in the family unit. It's always better to have age appropriate conversations about where kids come from than it is to outright lie and claim that other people shouldn't matter to them. \n\nIn a donor egg or sperm situation, those kids are also missing out on half their biological family and don't have the ability to consent to being brought into this world with no connection to those folks. Their parents sign away their rights for them to search for their sperm donor and sign consent forms claiming the child will never do a DNA test to track down who their donors are. The families of donors often have no knowledge that they have extended members through the sperm and egg donor network until they show up on the doorstep fully grown.", "Hes a bad father for lying to his step child and denying them their paternal family", "I don't think she disowned the father that raised her or her bio mother for any reasons than the lies and deceit they fed her for decades and the cutting off of familial ties she could have had.\n\nTime and time again parents are told that it's tramatic and damaging to people who find out the truth later in life. It should normalized and part of their lives from the get go. The parents were being selfish when they made those decisions and are suffering the consequences for that selfishness.", "Lying to someone their entire life is NOT treating someone well!", "I tried talking to them both and they just tell me they don't want me to know my bio family and believe I was wrong to have a relationship with them. They still feel that way.\n\nMy father was in a fatal accident. Four people died in the same accident.", "It will depend. If they continue telling me I can't have contact with my biological family, if they continue to act like I should do what they say when they say it because they say it, we're going to have more and more problems. There is no remorse from either of them and they seem to think I'm unreasonable.", "I had a good childhood. I would say the lies made it less healthy though. Like I was lied to when asked who I looked like. I was also lied to every time I was never told about my biological family.", "not step child. Is his child", "I agree, the parents shouldn't have lied at all unless good reason (bio family is toxic, etc) and even then the truth comes out at an appropriate age. And absolutely the parents shoudln't be digging in now that OP is 21 can has decided to seek out and include bio family. I understand being mad, but I feel like some empathy on both sides is needed here. Don't throw out the 20 years of solid, good relationship bc they made a mistake in what they thought was in the best interest of their kid at the time. Talk about it, understand it, and get through it.  \n\n\nAs an adopted kid, it hurts to read peole throwing away parents who love and care about them", "How many times have you talked about your conception with your parents? They made a choice before she was born that dad was dad and that was it.   \n\n\nI agree they should have included bio family and been upfront from the beginning, but that's also making the assumption that bio family was worth keeping in the picture. In the end, Mom owes nothing to bio family and she was trying to protect her kid, so if they were toxic, abusive, controlling, etc - she gets to choose what she thinks is right. She absolutely shouldn't be doubling down now that OP is old enough to protect himself. But to disown your loving father bc of this is pretty shitty unless there is more going on", "Small, possibly unwelcome note,: your mom and stepdad are likely insecure of their relationship with you now and afraid they're gonna lose you if you get closer to his family. \n\nEmotions are insane things sometimes and people can react in some of the most irrational ways. Doesn't justify their reaction or mean they're right for acting that way.", "So it was quite a sudden accident then which could be classed as very traumatic for her. Sometimes, people's coping strategy is to leave every part of that past behind them for them to be able to move on and live their lives. \n\nBut, you also don't know what your biological dad was like to your mom. What if he wasn't a very nice person to her and this was her chance to break free finally and escape from a bad situation? \n\nIt would also be difficult for your mum and step-dad because they raised you the best way they thought best. It doesn't make it right, but it is a very complicated situation.\n\nYou are choosing to favour people you have never met until recently and had nothing to do with your upbringing. Yet your mom and stepdad raised you. Do you really want to throw everything away over this?", "But those lies only affected you after you found out? Meaning they didn't take away from the good childhood you had at that time?", "Her mother and step father are selfish people. They deny op from having a connection to her paternal family. When op finds out they brow beat her to stop asking and when op meets and has a relationship with paternal family the mother and stepfather throw a fit and act like children", "They do when I look back at it. At the time they didn't.", "Lying is only ok if it\u2019s caught?", "Okay, thank you for clarifying!\n\nIn my opinion, ESH. Your mom did deprive you of his whole side of the family, so she's definitely an AH with that. Also for trying to TELL you that you can't have your wedding or whatever there, etc. \n\nBut she also gave you a happy, healthy, stable life and childhood, as did your stepdad. He loved you as your father and didn't treat you any less than his daughter. Your mom also likely made her decision in a dark and chaotic time for her, and it may have been easier for her to deal with everything by stopping contact with his family. People grieve differently and often make bad decisions in that process, especially life changing ones. Sticking to it after time and healing was bad on their part, but I don't think it was intended to hurt you. \n\nYou cutting contact with them and telling her to fuck off, etc, is why I also feel you're kind of the AH. Yes, it was horrible to find out they'd lied to you your whole life about that, and for how she acted about a wedding and such. You were, and I'm sure still are very emotional about this, which is understandable. But I can't agree that you should have cut them off and lashed out at them about it when they raised you, loved you, and made sure you had a happy, healthy, and stable life.\n\nI'm sure this will be a controversial opinion. But honestly, you all need some therapy to work through this and heal to move forward. Best of wishes!", "I have been in therapy for a while now. Working through it makes me even more angry at her to be honest. Has made me reflect on a lot of it even more than at face value. She hasn't changed either and has no regrets about it. That makes it even worse for me.", "I would ask her to attend therapy with you. You can\u2019t possibly begin to understand what your mom was experiencing. Not only was she pregnant but she was now a widow. The grief and the emotions and the fear had to be intense. She also knew your bio-dad\u2019s fam and my guess is there was most likely bad blood there somewhere to lead to such a drastic decision.  As a therapist we have a saying that we have to meet people where they are at. What I mean by this is you can\u2019t remove her mental state at the time of making her decision from the equation. \n\nI am not defending her. I think it was a poor decision. I am just trying to show that you don\u2019t KNOW what she is was going through at the time. And it clearly wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you or punish you because by your own admission you had a good, loving childhood. \n\nI would suggest you and her get therapy together. But I would also say to be prepared for the possibility of learning things about your bio dad or his family that she has continued to shield you from. \n\nI am not giving a vote because honestly this is too big for this sub. You need to seek professional help for you both together.", "I understand how hurt, betrayed, and angry you must feel about being lied to. But I really can't understand how you cutting them off, the parents that loved, cared for, provided for, and emotionally & physically supported you your entire life is a logical thing for you to do. You admit that, until you found out about them lying, you had a good, healthy, and happy childhood. Your perception of it is just darkened by the lie now. There are so many kids that only ever dreamed of having that. Not just one, but two active, stable, and healthy consistent parents that were always there. But because of your hurt and anger over their lie, as well as what seems like a defensive and insecure response to your relationship with his family from your mom, you want to cut them from your life and have no respect or appreciation for the love and life they've given you. \n\nAgain, they were wrong for lying, and for the reaction to your relationship with his family. But damn, parents are people just like you and me. There is seriously no handbook or guide to being a parent. They make mistakes, and often don't know until the damage is done. Your mom made a bad choice after a terrible tragedy, and stuck with that choice afterwards possibly because she didn't want to hurt you. I'm not judging you or your decision, just offering my opinion and I'm sorry that you are going through this, and I honestly hope you all find some peace and healing together.", "That is not something I am willing to do given how they have reacted to all this. Right now I don't have any trust left in them. Still acting like they get to call the shots and deny me my own biological family. I'd have more compassion if either acknowledged how wrong what they did was. Always tell kids the truth even if it's bad. It does bite you in the ass.", "People need to learn to own up to their mistakes. And mistakes were made by both. Both of them when I was 18 and learned the truth attempted to stop me from reaching out to my bio relatives. Both of them more or less said dad is dad and bio needs to be forgotten because we want to keep pretending we're both your biological parents. Don't reach out. They went hard on that. Were pissed I wanted to know. I even heard from some of my cousins that they were saying my bio family and I had no right to know each other. Yes, they gave me a happy childhood. Yes, I didn't feel unloved or angry back then. But they are still denying what they did was wrong.\n\nThey are still trying to push out people who are biologically related to me because it ruins what THEY want."]}
