To make a long story short I'll give you the bullet point version of events up until now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] My brother was dating a girl for two years but he broke up with her to \"be alone for a while and focus on himself\".\n\n\\[2\\] Not 3 weeks later he had a new girlfriend that I found out about via Instagram.\n\n\\[3\\] I confronted him about not communicating this new development with me, expressing that I didn't appreciate finding this out on social media. He apologized and said he would call me next time.\n\n\\[4\\] About a week later, him and his new girlfriend came to visit so we could meet her. Call it sisters intuition, but seeing as my brother NEVER would visit out of the blue, I was suspicious.\n\n\\[5\\] My suspicions were confirmed when that afternoon they announced they were engaged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to recap the timeline, they had been dating for barely 6 weeks, and we had only just met her a few HOURS before this announcement. We (my parents, me, and my husband) were all speechless to say the least. We didn't want to make her feel like she was not welcome before we even had the chance to get to know her properly. It wasn't her fault my brother was blindsiding us. So we congratulated them and tried to act enthusiastic about it all. Also, I just found out last week that they are having a baby. Again, speechless. Let me be clear; if my brother is happy, I am happy. But I'm still getting use to the IDEA of this perfect stranger being my sister-in-law, so finding out they were pregnant was a lot to process.  \n\n\nMy husband and I have not had the opportunity in the past couple of years to celebrate our anniversary in any way. We decided this year we wanted to travel and visit some friends out of state that we haven't seen since prior to COVID. We have already taken time off of work, and bought our plane tickets. Yesterday, my mother tells me that my brother and his fianc\u00e9 have set a date for their wedding during the time my husband and I are meant to be on our anniversary trip. I expected at the very least, for him to check with his immediate family to make sure there wasn't anything we already had planned. Especially since the wedding is happening on such short notice.   \n\n\nMy mother hinted that I should try to reschedule or delay my anniversary trip to be at my brothers wedding. Full honesty, I don't know if I want to. Not just because of the money we have already invested into this trip, but because 1) he knows when my anniversary is so he shouldn't have planned his last minute wedding in the same week and 2) he didn't communicate with me AGAIN. If he really wanted his sister there, I'd assume he would have at least called me before setting a date. I would have been happy to celebrate my anniversary a week before/after if I had been given the chance. I can tell he is upset about the possibility of me not being there, but I feel he has dug his own grave. AITA?\n\nUpdate for some added context:\nNo I don\u2019t expect my brother to tell me everything/get approval from me before he does something. This is all happening on the tail end of a conversation we had about trying to be in each other\u2019s lives more. That compounded with that fact that, personally, I don\u2019t like finding out major life updates from my immediate family through social media. He knows this and still didn\u2019t call me to tell me he had a new girlfriend. Regardless I wasn\u2019t angry; the word \u201cconfronted\u201d has an aggressive \nconnotation. I just wished he had told me directly. Im not judging his decisions in the slightest. He is welcome to start dating/break up with someone whenever he chooses. I was only attempting to emphasize the rushed timeline of it all. And yes he knew my anniversary date. I spoke to him over the phone just days before my mother told me they had set a date and mentioned that we would travel for our anniversary this year. He was aware enough that if he wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any scheduling conflict, he would have called. But he didn\u2019t. To clarify: they were together for almost two months before announcing the engagement. And waited another 5 weeks to announce the pregnancy. I think the baby is definitely his; they just want to get married before the baby comes.

But also if it\u2019s a wedding on short notice they may not have had many options for dates with the venue/vendors/etc. \n \nBut you are TA as well here for a few reasons - \n \n1. You got mad at him for not calling you to tell you, specifically, that he was dating someone. And from the tone of your post you\u2019re judgey and dismissive of him over that from jump. \u201cNot three weeks later\u2026\u201d \u201cI confronted him\u2026\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate finding this out\u2026\u201d Why are you his keeper? And judging him for breaking up with someone to be alone for a while but then dating someone else a few weeks later?

You were \u201csuspicious,\u201d he \u201cblindsided us,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to,\u201d \u201cI expected at the very least,\u201d \u201che didn\u2019t communicate with me AGAIN.\u201d \n \nThis isn\u2019t about you. His life and relationships aren\u2019t about you. You\u2019re obviously being kept in the loop, since you are on his social media, you attended the meet and greet dinner so you were there for the engagement announcement, your mother called to talk about the wedding date. \n \nYour brother has bigger fish to fry right now, rather than rolling out a red carpet and making sure you\u2019re informed the second things happen. He\u2019s engaged, planning a wedding, and about to be a father. He\u2019s got a lot going on. \n \nI\u2019m honestly very confused at the relationship dynamics in your family. Are you generally in the center of the action all the time? Do things usually hinge on your participation? \n \nYou said you can cancel the trip, which indicates you could reschedule it to a later date so that you can attend a *major life event* for your brother. So that you can ensure you start your relationship with your new sister in law off on the right foot. \n \nYou choosing not to do so reads to me like an adult tantrum. Your brother\u2019s focus and priority is not on making sure you\u2019re intimately involved and providing up to the minute updates on everything. \n \nYes, it would have been polite for him to check with people on dates. Which is why this is ESH. \n \nBut everything else you\u2019re complaining about? To me it just reads as unreasonable expectations for 2 adult siblings living their own lives. You need to rein that in before you make a choice you can\u2019t come back from. Missing a sibling\u2019s wedding when you had other options? That\u2019s petty to me.", "NTA. If you want to change your existing plans for this, that's up to you. But that's entirely up to you.

What your brother does and how he does it is up to him and his fiance. \n\nThis doesn't mean that you will have to accommodate it, but you don't have a say in what your brother does or who he does it with. The fact that you do not know the girl is not relevant. Sure you want the best for your brother, but it's not up to you.", "NTA\u2026 but I do think you should go to your brothers wedding.

You\u2019re pissy about how you found out about the girlfriend and confronted for living his own damn life. I get that your feelings are hurt but that\u2019s really about you. He shared his engagement with you and your family and  even though you say you all acted happy for him I\u2019m pretty sure both of them could feel the chill in the room. Now mad at him for the timing his wedding. Did he know you were going on a trip?\n\nBe happy for him, send them a gift and go on your trip! Have fun! Release some tension.

What if he called and said he wanted you to be there but he knew about your trip and decided to schedule his wedding anyway because that was the only way to have a wedding ASAP? I suspect you'd still be annoyed at having to miss a big trip and cancel and lose money just because of your brother's mistakes.\n\nThe thing is, even if your brother was prioritizing you, which admittedly, I don't know whether he's been considerate of you at all--there's probably no other way for him to have his wedding ASAP. Wedding venues book for a year out regularly and are booking even further out because of the Covid backlog. If he found a place within budget with a free weekend day between now and when the baby arrives, he's justified in taking it. From his perspective, you'll have an anniversary every single year for basically the next 40 years. There's no reason this one is so important, except to you. \n\nYou said yourself you have the type of relation where you were surprised that your brother was making time to visit out of the blue. It sounds like you're not active super close. If you want to admit that to yourself and others by going on your trip with the excuse you couldn't cancel and he was too much of a jerk to check about your travel dates, then you should prioritize having fun and skip his wedding. But since you want to have the type of relationship where he's close enough to call you about dates and really wants you at his wedding and other future family events, then this is a time to compromise and overlook his thoughtlessness. If he's not ordinarily a selfish person, it could because he has a lot of new responsibilities on his plate. If he's typically thoughtless and selfish, well then that pattern will continue and you can point to the pattern of incidents where he's been a jerk, but in this incident, skipping a sibling's wedding to travel doesn't leave you smelling of roses.\n\nP.S. if you lose your deposits, you can absolutely use that financial hit to justify a lack of large wedding present or a late wedding present. In theory the present can be one year after the wedding, and since you and I think there's a chance they might not still be together by then you can skip the gift at that point. Or just give them a baby shower gift or baby related gift instead.", "not to mention, the timing of the \u201cnew\u201d gf and the pregnancy makes me wonder if he knew her before his break up with his previous gf and thus why everything\u2019s been rushed.\n\neven if it is not that, by having a wedding at a short notice runs the risk of people not being able to drop everything to attend. \n\nNTA OP. send a card and a nice gift (& baby gift).", "[removed]", " I thought this had been planned for ages.", "Glad someone mentioned this.

He can announce a new girlfriend any way he pleases (maybe I\u2019m old, but when I was still dating, putting something on social media was a perfectly normal way of saying you were now on a relationship - I never felt I had to call my sister first). \n\nNow, there are some clues that maybe brother cheated and got the new girlfriend pregnant, but that\u2019s not been proven and still would not mean he necessarily owes OP more consideration than he has already given.", "[removed]", "Go enjoy your marriage.

When is the baby due?", "My guess is he did.", "Yeah, even if they slept together on the first date the whole \"finding out you're pregnant six weeks later and then getting engaged\" is a highly unlikely timeline. OP's brother was messing around and OP should definitely point it out to anyone in the family who gives her crap for skipping the wedding. It's not likely that the marriage will last anyway.", "That was my thinking too.", "That makes it even worse.", "That is how it works getting pregnant. Lol", "Definitely putting my money on \"baby is his but the fianc\u00e9e is way further along than '6 weeks.'\" I'm guessing the brother broke up with his ex- girlfriend about the time his now fianc\u00e9e actually found out she was pregnant.", "To be fair, pregnancy math means that pregnancy is always 2 weeks further along. If she is 6 weeks pregnant, that means the baby was made 4 weeks ago.", "Angela?", "You are correct, however, that's only one cycle. It's totally possible to be farther along by even a couple months, it explains a lot of questions kids had around the 1950's when dates didn't exactly add up to wedding anniversaries. \n\n If it's true, then I see baby trapping. Who agrees to get married immediately to someone they have been dating a month and a half? \n\nThere's too many \"wtf\" moments in this story for all of it to be on the up and up. Worst case, if it is all sunshine and rainbows we're talking about two incredibly immature people who have no business getting married. \n\nIt's a train wreck no matter what direction you watch it from so I wouldn't cancel my plans. I'd be loving and supportive of them as much as I could be, but I would not rearrange my life for something I could watch on Jerry Springer. \n\nHow are you going to date someone for four years and then jump into marriage weeks later with a stranger? I bet he doesn't even know how she likes her eggs. \n\nOP doesn't have to be mean about it, she doesn't have to verbalize any of these things I'm saying, (Lord knows I never would, I'm expressing inside thoughts here) but we're all thinking it.", "r/unexpectedoffice", "NTA - but if you can get your money back, move your trip and go to the wedding.

Even when he doesn\u2019t deserve it. Have a calm convo with him about it, be pissed for a day, then forgive him, get yourself in a good mood, and go. \n\nSometimes love is giving the other person what they need, even if they need it because they made a series of really fucking dumb decisions.

If your presence was so important to your brother, he would have checked with you first(it's a matter of a week-he could do it before or after).\n\nHowever, you have some unusual family dynamics.   You were annoyed that he posted about his girlfriend of 3 weeks rather than tell you in person.  Really, are you that into each other's underwear that he has to call you every time he starts seeing a new person before he talks about it publicly?  I could see him not posting an engagement before telling his nuclear family(parents/siblings) but even that in some families wouldn't be that unusual.  \n\nYou use of suspicious/suspicions is just weighted with family drama and very judgmental.\n\nJust saw your update.  Doesn't help much just reaffirms much of what you said originally, and saying you aren't judging when your post screams \"judging\" ...well, we tell ourselves what we  want to believe.\n\nAnd as to the quickness of the wedding unless your anniversary is not for 6+ months, I'm not sure how shotgun this wedding needs to be.  I think the other redditors are correct and he was seeing this woman while he was still with his old girlfriend.  \n\nPS: your dislike of reading about family news on Social Media is your issue to deal with, not your brother's.  It's his life, to be lived how he wishes to live it.  And if that's posting it right away on social media, that's his choice.", "NTA.

Send them a present. Take them out to dinner when you get back.", "NTA, but honestly, what makes you so certain that he was only with her for 2 months before they got engaged?  His excuse to his other girlfriend of \"I need to find myself and be alone\" sounds like just that, an excuse.  Given their quick engagement and baby, It sounds more to me like he was cheating on his ex, probably for a while, and needed an excuse to get away to be with this girl.  It's probably less rushed than you all think it is.  Anyway, you don't need to change your plans around just because your brother is having a shotgun wedding.", " NTA ...\n\n\nIt was so important for you to be at his wedding....why didn't he call you up and ask about his date then??? And still hasn't!!\n\n\nAlso...him breaking up with his girlfriend and getting with his current girlfriend 3 weeks later wasn't a coincidence either.", "NTA.

Are you sure you want to be more involved in someone like that\u2019s life?", "He didn't provide a Save the Date notice, so you didn't save the date. NAH.", "NTA", "So what happened here is your brother obviously cheated on his gf, knocked up the other woman, and then \u201cstepped up\u201d and got engaged. \n\nThat\u2019s a whole mess I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere near.

The thing is, you cannot expect people to change plans they have already made to come to an event you are hosting.  \n\nI missed my cousin's wedding because I was a judging a science fair that day.  It was a very quick wedding, hosted at his parents' house, planned last minute.  I didn't even find out about it till I had already been at the fair for hours.  If there were any hard feelings between me and my cousin, he hasn't told me about it.  No one expected me to give up my previously arranged plans, though I definitely would have backed out of the science fair if I'd known about it ahead of time.", "NTA.

Tell him the truth and enjoy your anniversary.", "Well I feel like you are an asshole for judging your brothers relationship which is a key point of this post, on the actual matter you are NTA to not want to completely reschedule your life around an event that you have no interest in going to, cuz you really shouldn't go to a wedding if you don't support the marriage happening, and already have plans.\n\nIf the wedding was well thought out and they actually wanted you to go, your brother would have said to his fiance that my sister already has her anniversary trip during that time, we should set the wedding for before or after that.", "NTA, buy I'm going to throw in my unsolicited opinion...your brother dumped his longterm gf for his side chick.  She was pregnant so he ran off with her and now they're marrying.  Your brother knew it was a conflict but you're under no obligation for his poor planning.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll make it to his next wedding.", "NTA - But even with your edit, you still seem to think you're entitled to informed of every personal decision your brother makes in his life.  He does not have to make you the first person he calls when he starts seeing someone.  Just because you *like* to know doesn't mean you're *entitled* to know.", "NTA People who organise a last minute event without seeking input from important attendees have to accept the risk that someone won't be able to attend due to previous commitments.

It\u2019s hard to know how what you post on the internet will be perceived. He knew my anniversary because I told him days before he set the date.

I wasn\u2019t mad, I just wished he had told me directly. Especially since he knows I don\u2019t like finding out things from immediate family through social media. Just a personal preference.
