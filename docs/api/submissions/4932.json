To make a long story short I'll give you the bullet point version of events up until now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] My brother was dating a girl for two years but he broke up with her to \"be alone for a while and focus on himself\".\n\n\\[2\\] Not 3 weeks later he had a new girlfriend that I found out about via Instagram.\n\n\\[3\\] I confronted him about not communicating this new development with me, expressing that I didn't appreciate finding this out on social media. He apologized and said he would call me next time.\n\n\\[4\\] About a week later, him and his new girlfriend came to visit so we could meet her. Call it sisters intuition, but seeing as my brother NEVER would visit out of the blue, I was suspicious.\n\n\\[5\\] My suspicions were confirmed when that afternoon they announced they were engaged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to recap the timeline, they had been dating for barely 6 weeks, and we had only just met her a few HOURS before this announcement. We (my parents, me, and my husband) were all speechless to say the least. We didn't want to make her feel like she was not welcome before we even had the chance to get to know her properly. It wasn't her fault my brother was blindsiding us. So we congratulated them and tried to act enthusiastic about it all. Also, I just found out last week that they are having a baby. Again, speechless. Let me be clear; if my brother is happy, I am happy. But I'm still getting use to the IDEA of this perfect stranger being my sister-in-law, so finding out they were pregnant was a lot to process.  \n\n\nMy husband and I have not had the opportunity in the past couple of years to celebrate our anniversary in any way. We decided this year we wanted to travel and visit some friends out of state that we haven't seen since prior to COVID. We have already taken time off of work, and bought our plane tickets. Yesterday, my mother tells me that my brother and his fianc\u00e9 have set a date for their wedding during the time my husband and I are meant to be on our anniversary trip. I expected at the very least, for him to check with his immediate family to make sure there wasn't anything we already had planned. Especially since the wedding is happening on such short notice.   \n\n\nMy mother hinted that I should try to reschedule or delay my anniversary trip to be at my brothers wedding. Full honesty, I don't know if I want to. Not just because of the money we have already invested into this trip, but because 1) he knows when my anniversary is so he shouldn't have planned his last minute wedding in the same week and 2) he didn't communicate with me AGAIN. If he really wanted his sister there, I'd assume he would have at least called me before setting a date. I would have been happy to celebrate my anniversary a week before/after if I had been given the chance. I can tell he is upset about the possibility of me not being there, but I feel he has dug his own grave.

But also if it\u2019s a wedding on short notice they may not have had many options for dates with the venue/vendors/etc. \n \nBut you are TA as well here for a few reasons - \n \n1. You got mad at him for not calling you to tell you, specifically, that he was dating someone. And from the tone of your post you\u2019re judgey and dismissive of him over that from jump. \u201cNot three weeks later\u2026\u201d \u201cI confronted him\u2026\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate finding this out\u2026\u201d Why are you his keeper? And judging him for breaking up with someone to be alone for a while but then dating someone else a few weeks later? People break up to \u201cbe alone\u201d a lot and realize it wasn\u2019t alone they needed it was to not be with their ex. \n \n2. Why is everything about you here? You were \u201csuspicious,\u201d he \u201cblindsided us,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to,\u201d \u201cI expected at the very least,\u201d \u201che didn\u2019t communicate with me AGAIN.\u201d \n \nThis isn\u2019t about you. His life and relationships aren\u2019t about you. You\u2019re obviously being kept in the loop, since you are on his social media, you attended the meet and greet dinner so you were there for the engagement announcement, your mother called to talk about the wedding date. \n \nYour brother has bigger fish to fry right now, rather than rolling out a red carpet and making sure you\u2019re informed the second things happen. He\u2019s engaged, planning a wedding, and about to be a father. He\u2019s got a lot going on. \n \nI\u2019m honestly very confused at the relationship dynamics in your family. Are you generally in the center of the action all the time? Do things usually hinge on your participation? \n \nYou said you can cancel the trip, which indicates you could reschedule it to a later date so that you can attend a *major life event* for your brother. So that you can ensure you start your relationship with your new sister in law off on the right foot. \n \nYou choosing not to do so reads to me like an adult tantrum. Your brother\u2019s focus and priority is not on making sure you\u2019re intimately involved and providing up to the minute updates on everything. \n \nYes, it would have been polite for him to check with people on dates. Which is why this is ESH. \n \nBut everything else you\u2019re complaining about? To me it just reads as unreasonable expectations for 2 adult siblings living their own lives. You need to rein that in before you make a choice you can\u2019t come back from. Missing a sibling\u2019s wedding when you had other options? That\u2019s petty to me.", "NTA. If you want to change your existing plans for this, that's up to you. But that's entirely up to you. He should not expect everyone to change plans because of their rush. \n\nIMHO, your bullet points 3, 4 and 5 are pretty petty. It sounds a bit entitled, which is confirmed late on. What your brother does and how he does it is up to him and his fiance. \n\nThis doesn't mean that you will have to accommodate it, but you don't have a say in what your brother does or who he does it with. The fact that you do not know the girl is not relevant. Sure you want the best for your brother, but it's not up to you.", "NTA\u2026 but I do think you should go to your brothers wedding.

Probably I would have a slightly different take were she not pregnant. The way they\u2019re going about things it doesn\u2019t *look* like their marriage is long for this world. But who knows.\n\nMissing a wedding is a \u2019no takebacksie\u2019 situation. It won\u2019t matter how reasonable your reasons.

Now mad at him for the timing his wedding. Did he know you were going on a trip?\n\nBe happy for him, send them a gift and go on your trip! Have fun! Release some tension.

He isn't responsible for tracking your anniversary date or assuming you'd have a trip planned- I suspect less than half adults have their siblings wedding dates memorized.

She got pregnant the first time they had sex, he married her, and she gave birth 6 months later to a healthy 7lb14oz baby boy. Is brother sure it's his?\n\nNTA. Your brother is moving too fast.

It reads like he didn't know or expected you'd have time for his shotgun wedding as you already booked time off.\n\nGood luck, OP. I'm also not included to take this relationship seriously, but if you don't want to alienate that girl (and their kid), being at the wedding is important.", "NTA. \n\nThis happened with my SIL. They were engaged for 2 months before they got married.

I was confused because we weren\u2019t canceling our complex, multi-family, year long plans for something we just found out about last week.\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 years and my MIL is still waiting for us to regret our decision.", "NTA. His wedding is a shotgun wedding because she is pregnant. You had already made plans and put money into those plans before he announced his wedding date.

Take care of yourself and your husband and friendships > some teachable moment.", "ESH. The only reason you suck is that I don't think you're being fully truthful with yourself. What if he called and said he wanted you to be there but he knew about your trip and decided to schedule his wedding anyway because that was the only way to have a wedding ASAP? I suspect you'd still be annoyed at having to miss a big trip and cancel and lose money just because of your brother's mistakes.\n\nThe thing is, even if your brother was prioritizing you, which admittedly, I don't know whether he's been considerate of you at all--there's probably no other way for him to have his wedding ASAP. Wedding venues book for a year out regularly and are booking even further out because of the Covid backlog. If he found a place within budget with a free weekend day between now and when the baby arrives, he's justified in taking it. From his perspective, you'll have an anniversary every single year for basically the next 40 years. There's no reason this one is so important, except to you. \n\nYou said yourself you have the type of relation where you were surprised that your brother was making time to visit out of the blue. It sounds like you're not active super close. If you want to admit that to yourself and others by going on your trip with the excuse you couldn't cancel and he was too much of a jerk to check about your travel dates, then you should prioritize having fun and skip his wedding. But since you want to have the type of relationship where he's close enough to call you about dates and really wants you at his wedding and other future family events, then this is a time to compromise and overlook his thoughtlessness. If he's not ordinarily a selfish person, it could because he has a lot of new responsibilities on his plate. If he's typically thoughtless and selfish, well then that pattern will continue and you can point to the pattern of incidents where he's been a jerk, but in this incident, skipping a sibling's wedding to travel doesn't leave you smelling of roses.\n\nP.S. if you lose your deposits, you can absolutely use that financial hit to justify a lack of large wedding present or a late wedding present. In theory the present can be one year after the wedding, and since you and I think there's a chance they might not still be together by then you can skip the gift at that point. Or just give them a baby shower gift or baby related gift instead.", "not to mention, the timing of the \u201cnew\u201d gf and the pregnancy makes me wonder if he knew her before his break up with his previous gf and thus why everything\u2019s been rushed.\n\neven if it is not that, by having a wedding at a short notice runs the risk of people not being able to drop everything to attend. \n\nNTA OP. send a card and a nice gift (& baby gift).", "[removed]", " I thought this had been planned for ages.", "Glad someone mentioned this. NAH, but OP seems to feel like she is owed an awful lot regarding her brother\u2019s romantic entanglements. She seems very judgmental about all of it too. Brother is allowed to break up with someone for any reason or no reason. Brother can jump back into the dating pool as quickly or as slowly as he likes. He can announce a new girlfriend any way he pleases (maybe I\u2019m old, but when I was still dating, putting something on social media was a perfectly normal way of saying you were now on a relationship - I never felt I had to call my sister first). \n\nNow, there are some clues that maybe brother cheated and got the new girlfriend pregnant, but that\u2019s not been proven and still would not mean he necessarily owes OP more consideration than he has already given.", "[removed]", "Go enjoy your marriage. This won't be his last, I'm sure.", "She could always tell her brother that she will be sure to come to his next wedding.", "I was thinking the same thing!

Hopefully Mom can FaceTime it live so we can watch as it happens. This is so exciting, we wish you all the best\u201d.\n\nIf there\u2019s any fallout, it will be because of her, and you\u2019ll know to always keep a spare room ready for him for when that dog and pony show falls apart.", "Exactly.

Do you really want to be technically right but live with missing your brother's wedding?", "No, the baby just came 3 months early at full size /s", "In all fairness, many women are announcing before 12 weeks these days. I'm one of them, I announced around 8 weeks to friends and family.", "Such a miracle that it was born at an ideal size and weight for a full-term baby! What are the odds?", "For me that just felt way too risky, I couldn't have beared it to tell everyone too early and then loose it as the most dsngerous time is over with the 12th week it's still more common at least where I live.\nOnly my doctor, partner and boss knew before 12 weeks."]}
