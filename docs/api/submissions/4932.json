To make a long story short I'll give you the bullet point version of events up until now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] My brother was dating a girl for two years but he broke up with her to \"be alone for a while and focus on himself\".\n\n\\[2\\] Not 3 weeks later he had a new girlfriend that I found out about via Instagram.\n\n\\[3\\] I confronted him about not communicating this new development with me, expressing that I didn't appreciate finding this out on social media. He apologized and said he would call me next time.\n\n\\[4\\] About a week later, him and his new girlfriend came to visit so we could meet her. Call it sisters intuition, but seeing as my brother NEVER would visit out of the blue, I was suspicious.\n\n\\[5\\] My suspicions were confirmed when that afternoon they announced they were engaged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to recap the timeline, they had been dating for barely 6 weeks, and we had only just met her a few HOURS before this announcement. We (my parents, me, and my husband) were all speechless to say the least. We didn't want to make her feel like she was not welcome before we even had the chance to get to know her properly. It wasn't her fault my brother was blindsiding us. So we congratulated them and tried to act enthusiastic about it all. Also, I just found out last week that they are having a baby. Again, speechless. Let me be clear; if my brother is happy, I am happy. But I'm still getting use to the IDEA of this perfect stranger being my sister-in-law, so finding out they were pregnant was a lot to process.  \n\n\nMy husband and I have not had the opportunity in the past couple of years to celebrate our anniversary in any way. We decided this year we wanted to travel and visit some friends out of state that we haven't seen since prior to COVID. We have already taken time off of work, and bought our plane tickets. Yesterday, my mother tells me that my brother and his fianc\u00e9 have set a date for their wedding during the time my husband and I are meant to be on our anniversary trip. I expected at the very least, for him to check with his immediate family to make sure there wasn't anything we already had planned. Especially since the wedding is happening on such short notice.   \n\n\nMy mother hinted that I should try to reschedule or delay my anniversary trip to be at my brothers wedding. Full honesty, I don't know if I want to. Not just because of the money we have already invested into this trip, but because 1) he knows when my anniversary is so he shouldn't have planned his last minute wedding in the same week and 2) he didn't communicate with me AGAIN. If he really wanted his sister there, I'd assume he would have at least called me before setting a date. I would have been happy to celebrate my anniversary a week before/after if I had been given the chance. I can tell he is upset about the possibility of me not being there, but I feel he has dug his own grave.

It all seems a little too quick and convenient.", "So I\u2019m going to go against what a lot of the other comments are saying and go with ESH. \n \nYes it would have been considerate for your brother to check with people before scheduling. But also if it\u2019s a wedding on short notice they may not have had many options for dates with the venue/vendors/etc. \n \nBut you are TA as well here for a few reasons - \n \n1. You got mad at him for not calling you to tell you, specifically, that he was dating someone. And from the tone of your post you\u2019re judgey and dismissive of him over that from jump. \u201cNot three weeks later\u2026\u201d \u201cI confronted him\u2026\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate finding this out\u2026\u201d Why are you his keeper? And judging him for breaking up with someone to be alone for a while but then dating someone else a few weeks later? People break up to \u201cbe alone\u201d a lot and realize it wasn\u2019t alone they needed it was to not be with their ex. \n \n2. Why is everything about you here? You were \u201csuspicious,\u201d he \u201cblindsided us,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to,\u201d \u201cI expected at the very least,\u201d \u201che didn\u2019t communicate with me AGAIN.\u201d \n \nThis isn\u2019t about you. His life and relationships aren\u2019t about you. You\u2019re obviously being kept in the loop, since you are on his social media, you attended the meet and greet dinner so you were there for the engagement announcement, your mother called to talk about the wedding date. \n \nYour brother has bigger fish to fry right now, rather than rolling out a red carpet and making sure you\u2019re informed the second things happen. He\u2019s engaged, planning a wedding, and about to be a father. He\u2019s got a lot going on. \n \nI\u2019m honestly very confused at the relationship dynamics in your family. Are you generally in the center of the action all the time? Do things usually hinge on your participation? \n \nYou said you can cancel the trip, which indicates you could reschedule it to a later date so that you can attend a *major life event* for your brother. So that you can ensure you start your relationship with your new sister in law off on the right foot. \n \nYou choosing not to do so reads to me like an adult tantrum. Your brother\u2019s focus and priority is not on making sure you\u2019re intimately involved and providing up to the minute updates on everything. \n \nYes, it would have been polite for him to check with people on dates. Which is why this is ESH. \n \nBut everything else you\u2019re complaining about? To me it just reads as unreasonable expectations for 2 adult siblings living their own lives. You need to rein that in before you make a choice you can\u2019t come back from. Missing a sibling\u2019s wedding when you had other options? That\u2019s petty to me.", "NTA. If you want to change your existing plans for this, that's up to you. But that's entirely up to you. He should not expect everyone to change plans because of their rush. \n\nIMHO, your bullet points 3, 4 and 5 are pretty petty. It sounds a bit entitled, which is confirmed late on. What your brother does and how he does it is up to him and his fiance. \n\nThis doesn't mean that you will have to accommodate it, but you don't have a say in what your brother does or who he does it with. The fact that you do not know the girl is not relevant. Sure you want the best for your brother, but it's not up to you.", "NTA\u2026 but I do think you should go to your brothers wedding. A wedding is a huge life event, even if it\u2019s is a hasty one. If you care about your relationship you should show up for him.", "NTA.\n\nBut it\u2019s one of those situations where it hardly matters. Probably I would have a slightly different take were she not pregnant. The way they\u2019re going about things it doesn\u2019t *look* like their marriage is long for this world. But who knows.\n\nMissing a wedding is a \u2019no takebacksie\u2019 situation. It won\u2019t matter how reasonable your reasons. It will likely cause huge rift.\n\nAnd you have a nephew or niece coming. You could decide to miss it. But good luck getting auntie time.", "ESH. You for being weirdly demanding of your brother's attention and him because he was definitely cheating on his old girlfriend.", "You might be an AH but not for going on your trip. It seems like you expect your brother to run every detail of his life by you for approval. He broke up to \u201cfocus on himself\u201d maybe that was what he told everyone to protect his privacy. You\u2019re pissy about how you found out about the girlfriend and confronted for living his own damn life. I get that your feelings are hurt but that\u2019s really about you. He shared his engagement with you and your family and  even though you say you all acted happy for him I\u2019m pretty sure both of them could feel the chill in the room. Now mad at him for the timing his wedding. Did he know you were going on a trip?\n\nBe happy for him, send them a gift and go on your trip! Have fun! Release some tension. Enjoy yourself and ask for video of the wedding or even watch it through Skype. You don\u2019t owe him anything just as he doesn\u2019t owe you.", "If you love your brother go to his wedding, it doesn't matter who at arsehole is.\n\nYour brother seems to have made a string of impulsive decisions, he'll either get lucky and it all works out... or he will need his family around him when it all comes tumbling down.\n\nMove your trip back a week - surely your relationship with him is worth that much", "You didn\u2019t really make it short.

It\u2019s hard to explain all the nuance with a 3000 character limit lol. Basically he was in a relationship for two years and broke it off with her to focus on himself. Our family had recently decided prior to all of this that we wanted to be better about communicating and keeping in touch since we can\u2019t always see each other in person (we live 4 hours away from each other). I am totally supportive of him getting into a new relationship if he changed his mind about being alone, but I found out he had a new girlfriend via social media, instead of him telling me directly. This is AFTER we had all said we should communicate better. I wasn\u2019t mad at him for it, just wish he had told me himself is all. I was told about his choice of wedding date after it had already been set. I\u2019m definitely not his keeper and I don\u2019t expect him to give me a play by play of every decision he makes.

There\u2019s a lot of context and nuance I couldn\u2019t include because of the character limit.

We\u2019ve had conversations about better communication, especially when it comes to important things. The word \u201cconfront\u201d has an aggressive connotation to it.

He was cheating around on the girlfriend and broke up when he found out the side girlfriend was pregnant.   I guess he's \"doing the right thing\" but they should do it at a courthouse, not make a big wedding.  They could have a moderate party some other time.

You are not the AH for already having (prepaid) plans, when this is probably quite short notice for a wedding.\n\nHowever, your complaints about him not telling you everything about his romantic life, your being shocked that his fiance is pregnant, and all the other judginess in your post are just you being AH-adjacent.
