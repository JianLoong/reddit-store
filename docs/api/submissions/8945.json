If she won't, and your parents aren't supportive, let them know you'll handle it yourself by doing the same thing to her. Start your own and fill it with bad photos of her and bad things about her.

My point here is that the rights are actually on the side of the person taking / posting the photos / comments.  Spreading false information that can lead people to make bad decisions isn't helpful.\n\n*\"op should stop hanging out with her sister if she continues to treat her like this.\"*\n\nYes, I fully agree. Their sister sounds like a childish, manipulative asshole."]}
