{"id": 21304, "submission_id": "14q4uka", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend that she\u2019s not a kid anymore?", "selftext": "A few months ago, me (M24) and my gf (F24) both graduated with our masters degrees. We met in Gradschool about 2 years ago and have been dating a little over a year. We really hit it off because even tho we are in very different fields, we both were very hard working (both with full rides through undergrad and grad school) and had a lot of goals and aspirations. Besides that, we also have a lot of similar interests and traits that brought us together.\n\nSo now that you know the context of our relationship, let me explain the situation. So a few weeks before graduation, my girlfriend said she was pausing the career hunt till after graduation and after her sister got married (middle of June). It was understandable though as she is really busy with maid of honor duties and she got her old gig back as a shift lead of a popular ice cream franchise. Now that the wedding has passed a few weeks ago, she brought it up to me today that she\u2019s going to postpone looking for jobs again for the next foreseeable future. When I asked why she said these quotes. \u201cI need time to find myself.\u201d \u201cI need more time to figure out my weaknesses.\u201d And lastly \u201cI need more time being a kid.\u201d \n\nI was kind of blindsided by this as she acted like I didn\u2019t understand at all. I was also scared of all of this change happening as I started my career, lost a parent, moved in by myself, and was supporting my other parent all in the matter of two months. She has wealthy parents, a self proclaimed perfect family, and a whole guest house all to herself. I don\u2019t know what came over me but I told her \u201cYou\u2019re 24, you\u2019re not a kid, we\u2019re lucky enough to have started our adulthood so late some have to start at 18.\u201d She then flipped out at me saying I had no idea how she felt even though I feel like I actually do. I also am really scared of growing up but part of being an adult is to push past that fear and move forward.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the job searching itself and more to do with her completely changing. She had so many goals and aspirations for her life and now she\u2019s completely complacent with bumming off her parents and \u201cenjoy my last bout of freedom\u201d. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: the more I reply to comments the more I\u2019m starting to realize this stems from a lot more than her not wanting to start her own life. We always talked about moving in with eachother and starting a life after college. She\u2019s the one who always talked about it. But after my father passed she became a lot more distant. I remember when I told her about having to take care of my mother, she made a weird comment about how that doesent seem fair to me and that no matter what she\u2019s going through, she doesn\u2019t get not do anything with her life. This was a direct contradiction when she basically said she\u2019s going to do the same thing. I\u2019m just hoping all of these things that happened to me recently wasn\u2019t an ick to her because she always talks about how she hates negative situations and being sad.", "created_utc": 1688445172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q4uka/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_shes_not_a/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get being shunted out into the real world after years of planning for it hypothetically must be overwhelming. And it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s forcing you to change your behavior at all to accommodate her (although if she\u2019s not keeping up her side of the partnership financially that\u2019s another thing). While it sounds like she\u2019s being kind of immature, it also is within her right. Capitalism is exhausting hell and she has the privilege of choosing when she jumps into it. I can also imagine how infuriating I\u2019d find watching her get to have that choice, considering what you\u2019re going through. While I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything wrong, I also completely understand why her behavior is causing you pain. I don\u2019t think you can or should reasonably ask her to do anything differently, it just seems like a case for empathy\u2014and maybe you connecting the dots for her about why this is affecting you so strongly, while emphasizing that you don\u2019t judge her.

You are 24, theres no rush to achieve anything, especially when she has such a wealthy family. \n\nYou have honestly shot yourself in the foot here. You are building adulthood up to be this extremely narrow box, from which there is no return, meanwhile your girlfriend is fearing she is heading down a funnel of no return. Reality is that she can take job today, and do something completely different in three months time. She doesnt actually need to pull the breaks here, adulthood and work is not a funnel, its brimming with opportunity. Theres really no better way to figure out your weakness, then to try something, theres no better way of figuring out what you want to do, then to give something a try. Getting a job will give her lots of opportunities, if she wants to go in a different direction, a job will give her skills and experience to do so, and the economic means to do so, on her own terms. \n\nIl be frank with you kid, I dont think its actually work, nor education she needs a break from, I suspect its you. She knows exactly what she gets with you, as you clearly have both your lives all figured out and planned. Perhaps it's exactly what she eventually would want, but you are not offering her the opportunity to decide for herself, no leeway to make adjustments, or grow into something different.

In that case, it's all between her and them. If they don't mind supporting their daughter while she finds herself, it shouldn't bother you. Someone else brought up a similar point, and I agree: could it be that you're not understanding of her because you had a hard time, and no one to support you and ease your burden?

Their life and economical status is so different that they cannot relate to you and you cannot relate to them. They know not your hardships and they judge you, and you can't help but building resentement for everything they have but you don't.\n\nIn my culture and religion, a very fundamental element in chosing a partner is \"adequacy\" for this very reason. If you're middle class and your partner is very rich, it'll create this distance between you, and this misunderstanding and maybe even resenting of the other. But, if she really loves you and you love her, and if you both are willing to put differences aside and try to understand the other, all will go well.\n\nYou aren't rivals, you are on the same team.

If she's changing so much that she's not that woman anymore, separation is a solution. I hope it doesn't get to that though. I don't know her but for you, it just feels you need to communicate your feelings, be understood, and also grieve and slowly heal from the pain you went through. It doesn't seem like you're asking for the moon. If what she needs is similar, everthing will be fine. You guys will be fine.", "So she wants support and understanding but couldnt give it when you needed it the most? Yeah, an honest conversations needs to happen.
