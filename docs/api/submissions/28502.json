Migraines are a complex neurological disease and absolutely life ruining. Unfortunately, medical science hasn't been able to give us good treatment options yet that are affordable and this condition is very dependent on what others do around us. Perfume, for example, is a very common trigger. I can smell people's perfume when I'm aisles away from them in the grocery store. I live in a suburb and sounds like lawn mowers and leaf blowers are absolute hell during a migraine.\n\nI see several people pointing out that they should have better air filtration. But even with good air filtration, I can smell everything in my house and there are people who have more sensitivity to smells than I do. \n\nI want to emphasize that I do not think you're a bad person, but I think everyone in this situation should be a little more understanding. I think the most practical solution is to give them a heads up so they can go somewhere else for a little while and minimize the times you have fires going.", "Recreational wood burning is disgusting.
