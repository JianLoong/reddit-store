It sucks that she has such a strong reaction to smoke but I don't think there's anything they can do to stop you. And if your firepit is a permanent structure, you can't exactly drag that off to the other side of the yard. NTA", "I have migraines. They are a misery. But, TBH, I can't expect my neighbors to stop normal enjoyments because of my afflictions. So, I keep my windows closed when my neighbors are enjoying fires outside.

I have a fire pit, barbecue and patio heaters myself.", "Neglected to mention that the neighbor sent me a very angry and self-righteous email last week accusing me of being a bad Christian because we had our first fire in 3 months. He's not wrong, I AM a bad Christian. But that's more because I don't believe in Jesus.", "Oh, this was an actual legal case in Ohio, NTA. The neighbor sued the other neighbor about the wood fired pizza oven in the back yard. The fire-free neighbor lost, and the pizza parties carried on.", "NTA, I am usually on the side of \"we live in a society, people could stand to be  little more considerate all around\" but\n\n why haven't they installed better HVAC or even just portable indoor air filter or ask you to please give them heads up so she can go hang out somewhere else for a while? Smoke won't stick around forever. They just jumped to legal threats which makes them entitled and the AH", "They are threatening legal action because they can't actually take any. Also, if smoke gives her migraines she can get a better air filtration system boom problem solved. NTA you can burn all day every day in your property if there are no city ordinances in place to stop it. At that, there is no way an outdoor fireplace/pit transfers enough \"smoke\" to even be noticeable within the home letalone fill it enough to cause migraines(unless they are leaving their doors open). Yes some people are allergy sensitive and soot in the air can cause problems, but you are not and you have 0 obligation to cater to someone else while your on your property minding your own business.", "INFO: What sort of wood are you burning for it to produce this sort of amount of smoke?", "There's a solution here but I think it has to be on their end. NTA for living your life. Having a fire does not constitute a public disturbance. There might be ways you can mitigate the smoke so I'd do what you can but she can also filter her air if it matters.", "Curious what sort of legal action they can take for this? Sounds like a no win situation it ducks for the wife but having spent so much building the pit to have to move it.

Otherwise it would be n a h\u2014I can definitely imagine this causing migraines, but you also have no way to move the pit and it\u2019s not quite reasonable to expect you not to ever use this lovely feature of your home.", "Try burning wood that doesn't smoke as much, like hardwoods", "I repurposed an old satellite dish 12 foot wide 4 foot deep into an outdoor fire pit.

The one time I was given a bullshit citation I fought it in court and won.

There is a way to sue someone in civil court for keeping you from being able to enjoy your home.\n\nI googled and found this:\n\u201cIn your case, this would potentially be an issue of \"private nuisance.\" You'd have to show that your neighbor is creating a condition of pollution (smoke) which is entering the bounderies of your property and disrupting your quiet enjoyment of the property.

The question will be the reasonableness of his actions.\u201d", "As someone with severe migraines due to smoke/fragrances can you ask for their number and tell them you\u2019ll text them before you light the fire? Can they pay for the fire pit to be moved to the other side of the yard?", "INFO: do you know whether your neighbour actually gets multi day migraines from the smoke, or they're exaggerating/lying to get you to stop?\n\nBecause if they're faking an illness to manipulate you, fuck them.

OR, if you were supposed to have permits and didn't get them as required, the court might make you remove it.", "INFO: is the fire pit the legal required distance from the property line and other houses per code?\n\nOur neighbors had to move their fire pit back in our previous state because they didn't build it the legal required distance from the property line and neighboring homes, although the inspector caught that when they came to inspect the patio installation and nobody had to complain.\n\nWe can't even legally have a (build-in) fire pit in our current home because there's no way for it to both be on our property and the legally required distance from our neighbor's houses and our house.", "Tbh it\u2019s hard to say because I get it\u2019s frustrating but I do feel bad for the women I wouldn\u2019t say your an asshole but it\u2019s a little inconsiderate", "NAH.

Does that make him an ah for using something he built on his property for the purpose it was built for? I'd say no and I think most would too.

Yeah, you can't move that and shouldn't be expected to tear it down and rebuild. 25ft is also typically an acceptable distance away from neighboring buildings per most fire codes.", "NTA - but here are some suggestions that maybe might help the overall situation. \n\nIf the bottom of the fire pit is in a hole below the surface of the poured concrete, you're probably making more smoke than is necessary due to not enough air getting in. You can fill the hole with gravel and build a block fire ring above the level of the slab (1 or 2 courses it all it would take) and have air gaps between the blocks. It can easily be done in a way that looks good aesthetically with the existing patio. \n\nAlso, not sure where you source it and what type of wood you burn, but some wood naturally smokes and smells more than others. Hardwoods are usually less smelly than pine, but the most important part is that it's completely dry.", "They can close the windows.", "I just love how specific your post is.", "If it\u2019s a pine or other evergreen the smoke is tar and smoke heavy, if it\u2019s Osage orange or locust- the smoke is nasty and irritating to many.\n\nFruit woods, maple, oak, walnut, and elm all produce pleasant smelling smoke with minimal irritants.", "NTA, but could you put a industrial/box fan to mitigate some of that smoke or at least disperse a bit away from their house?", "Go get some better firewood\u2026 burning a tree from your yard is gonna be nasty.\n\nOtherwise NTA but this would definitely help", "\"an act, condition, or thing that is illegal because it\u00a0interferes\u00a0with the rights of the public generally\" that is the legal definition of public nuisance. In that they no way have interfered with their neighbors rights. So there is nothing legally to be done. One could argue right to pursue happiness, because it makes neighbors happy to be outside and smoke interfere ls with that. However interference is a physical act within the law, so he could in no way be liable.", "Don't engage them. They threatened legal action and will try to use anything you give them.

STFU.", "We are currently in WA state and our local fire code (these codes tend to be by local jurisdiction) states that all permanent fire pits must be 25 feet from all structures (including your own house and even deck).  This is county code here, because we are unincorporated.\n\nOur previous house was in IL and the town fire code there stated 20 feet from property line and all structures.", "I think the reasonable thing to do is for OP to at least *try* to move the fire pit. It's not right for other people to suffer because of decisions you make. While you can legally do what you want on your property, this is about compassion.Also, OP mentions that they use the fire pit every 2-3 weeks during the fall. That means they likely don't even need to move it far, just make a slight adjustment to the placement.", "Or they could close their windows....", "Where the hell do you think firewood you buy comes from? 8tncomes.from.trees.just like OP cut down.", "Noise is a nuisance. And in DC, second hand smoke has been determined to be a nuisance.", "I second this. They\u2019ve already threatened legal action.

We have a circular cinderblock firepit wall sitting in that spot.\n\nThey can't move it, it's built into the concrete patio. It's permanent, the only way to move it would be to destroy it and rebuild elsewhere which would cost OP thousands of dollars.", "The way I see it, at this point, it is not about compassion or being a good neighbor either. It's about not being bullied by entitled people.\n\nIt's the neighbor that's having an unusual reaction to a usual use. It should be on them to find a solution first and ask politely if no other way can be found. For example, why don't the neighbor get indoor air cleaner? They cost like 50-100 bucks for a HEPA one that can clear a room from all smoke within a minute. \n\nWhy don't the neighbor ask them to please give heads up on bbq days so they can go hangout somewhere else etc\n\nIt's their issue and them not taking any preventative measures and expecting their neighbors to live to accommodate them and threatening them when they won't  is an entitled and assholish behavior", ">I feel the neighbor is being pretty unreasonable, considering the situation. If the concrete really can't be adjusted, then it isn't really realistic for the neighbor to demand they move it in the first place. While the situation is unfortunate, it seems unreasonable for them to try to stop OP from using their own property in this way, especially if there are no alternatives available.  \nOn the other hand, I hope OP continues to be considerate of their neighbors in the way they use the fire pit. It should be possible to minimize the amount of smoke and use it in a way that bothers their neighbors as little possible.", "This is where I'm at right now. We've been minimizing the amount of fires we do because of this and we're going to try to get some wood that might kick out less smoke. I hate the idea of being the bad guy in this family's life, but I also don't want to eliminate one of our favorite family activities if there's not another way around it."]}
