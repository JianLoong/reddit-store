Its no secret that gathering a deposit for a house is not easy. While we saved up 80% of it, my parents also gifted us $20k. \nMy Bf and I discussed when my parents gifted us the funds towards our deposit that his parents would also gift this (agreed my his parents), but they would give it to us after we moved in since we already had enough for the deposit for the house we wanted. I understand that I am very privileged to have this issue so this is why I am struggling within myself about whether I should even be concerned about this.\n\nTo give some background, when I was growing up, my parents were low wage earners and we lived paycheck to paycheck every single week. My parents worked extremely hard and lived frugally to pay off their mortgage. They never go on holidays, rarely buy expensive things and live very simply, working towards retirement as they are in their 60s. On the other hand, my BFs parents who are a lot younger than my parents have their own business, that is highly profitable and they live a very comfortable, lavish life. Think buying a new BMW and Merc and then not liking the Merc so buying a Porsche instead, spending $50k on a holiday, and spending $30k on an anniversary party, all in the span of 6 months. Overall, no money troubles at all. \n\nSo cut to us moving to our house, BFs parents gave us $500, their old washing machine and a vacuum cleaner. I was grateful, but I couldn't help but question, if their offer was still on the table as we wanted to fix a few things in our house, eg a huge leak in our bathroom wall. I asked my BF what was happening and he got extremely defensive saying how dare I ask this question and telling me how materialistic I was. He was also with his mum at this time that I was unaware of and he proceeded to tell him mum while I was on the phone that \"OP is upset that you haven't given us $20k like her parents did, are you still going to?\" and they had a laugh about it. I have since asked twice and again I have been dismissed and been told that I should not have ridiculous expectations and that his parents shouldn't have to match what my parents did. I also mentioned to my bf that I felt it was rude when his mother showed me the 3 designer bags that she had purchased as well as all the gold and diamond jewellery while on holiday, right after I mentioned that the increases on our mortgage payments were really starting to pinch. Again, I was told that I have no right to question this. \n\nI would not have cared if they didn't gift us anything if they didn't say on many occasions that they would give what my parents did,  if they didn't invite all of their friends over to my house warming that I was not aware of, and if they were struggling financially (I help with the family business so am very across their financial).

Check out the book \"Why Does He Do That?\" by Lundy Bancroft.", "NTA, but you still need to accept that you aren't going to see that money in a way that is actually productive to a future with this guy or in this family.\n\nYou bought a house with someone you are not married to, using your own funds and funds from your parents with the expectations that his parents would also give you funds after closing? You're also helping out with his family business?\n\nDid you contribute equal amounts to the home or do you now have $20K more equity in a home than he does despite it being in both of your names? Did you otherwise contribute equally (the way this is written it sounds like you jointly put down $80k)? What happens if you break-up?\n\nSimilarly, are you getting paid fairly for the work you are doing for his family? Or are you \"just helping out the family\" with no compensation? Again, what happens if you don't work out or even if you do but you never reap the rewards of a family business since you are not family?\n\nYou also mention mortgage payments are \"starting to pinch.\" Did the two of you actually take on the kind of house that makes sense for you with your incomes and stage of life? Or did you take on more than you can reasonably afford? Given that you aren't married, the standard rule is to only purchase property one person can afford on their own/ that one person has the ability to buy from the other or that can be easily resold in case of a break-up? If the market crashes such that it is hard to sell the home and neither of you can afford the mortgage payments on your own, you're going to end up in a very difficult situation. \n\nFurthermore, you say, \"My Bf and I discussed when my parents gifted us the funds towards our deposit that his parents would also gift this (agreed my his parents), but they would give it to us after we moved in since we already had enough for the deposit for the house we wanted.\" And you mention that they said they were giving this money many times over to you. How did this all come about? Did they offer or did your boyfriend ask? Were explicit amounts mentioned before they agreed or did they just say they'd match what your parents' matched (perhaps thinking your parents gave a lot less)? Was a timeline agreed to or was it \"sometime after you bought the house\"? How much of this was said directly to you and how much has been filtered through your boyfriend?  Was everyone present and sober when agreements were made and discussed? Do you even know for sure they didn't give your boyfriend $20K that he stashed or forgive a $20K loan they'd made to him in the past? Unless this was all very clear cut it's entirely possible they thought they were helping out in some other way (like giving him $20K more in inheritance, paying off a vehicle they bought him, putting more toward a future wedding, etc.). \n\nIt sounds like the much bigger issue is that you're pretending to be married to someone you aren't actually married to and you're assuming his family operates like yours does. This is going to cause a whole host of problems unless the two of you worked with individual lawyers on both sides and have some pretty clear cut legal agreements. This is precisely why people say not to buy a house with someone you aren't married to. This was a potentially very foolish financial decision.\n\nYou need to think about your goals for this relationship and for how finances will be looked at now and in the future. Because if you go to him now and establish any money from your parents are \"your\" contribution and any money from his parents as \"his\" there are some implications. That's absolutely fair in the present, your parents have contributed more. But it does set the precedent for how future money is handled too (inheritance, wedding gifts, etc.) In other words, you can look at it like your parents gave him $10K and you $10K or you can look at it like your parents gave you $20K. If your parents gave you $20K, then you contributed an additional $20K assuming he'd be contributing an additional $20K from his parents. Which means you are absolutely getting used. Either way, I don't think you're going to get the money from his parents by pushing harder (and you'll just get labeled a gold digger here). If it was just a verbal agreement I'd assume it isn't coming and then know not to make future plans based on what they say they'll do for you. Meanwhile, you and he can decide as a couple how to handle the discrepancy in what you each contributed. There are fair ways to do this (example: he pays slightly more toward the mortgage, utilities, and home repairs until it comes out even, or you two sit down with lawyers and draw up an ownership agreement that gives you a higher percentage of equity in the home, or you consider that 20K a loan from your parents to both of you and draw up and agreement/ he pays them 10K back). But some of those ways assume you'll be together for a long time. Given that you are unmarried, not respected by his family, and still fairly young, that's a pretty big assumption/ gamble you just made.\n\nI'd guess you end up learning a harsh lesson about buying property with someone you aren't married to when the two of you inevitably break-up and the he walks away having gotten 50% of a home he didn't contribute 50% to and free labor at his families' business to marry someone he actually respects, likes, and treats well around his family.", "Bf's family sounds suspect as hell, and personally I wouldn't have co-ownership of anything with my girlfriend.

If you're married, it's always a 50/50 split, unless going to court.", "Do you know how Aussie laws work? Because I do. Spent a lot of time there. Live with a boyfriend for two years, buy a house that you equally contribute to, the courts are likely to find you in a de facto relationship.  Housing is very expensive there. Many couples do the house first. \n\nDon\u2019t presume to know what I know. Our common law in the states is nothing like their common law. I dated an Aussie for years.", "They mean the law recognises de facto relationships. Not sure if the exact law in Aus, but in NZ (which I know is broadly similar in this regard) if you\u2019ve been living with a partner for 3 years, you have most of the legal protections of marriage.", "Most states have dropped their common law statutes. Only Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and the District of Columbia still honor common law marriage. The IRS will only consider it if the state recognizes the couple as married.", "We have been together for 7 years", "yep, I really hope they set up everything properly", "Too bad you already closed on the house. Otherwise I'd suggest walking away from this guy.", "OP... You really need to think about your options here, because this man was beyond condescending and rude. I agree with another comment about seriously thinking about whether he should stay as a bf and definitely NOT upgrade to husband.\n\nSecondly, who's name is on the house? Please make sure that you are not in a tricky situation.\n\nAnd lastly, from personal experience those that have, tend to be the ones that are least generous because they don't know what it's like to go without.\nRich people will NEVER understand poverty or what it's like to be poor. Never expect them to either.\n\nNTA.", "YTA Sadly, you purchased a house with someone you're not married to. Your parents contributed 20k in equity that is essentally a gift to him. You need to immediately check your states laws regarding shared property. if the relationship goes south, he may be entitled to 50% of its value. How much either of you contributed to the down-payment may not be taken into account. If the boyfriend fails to contribute to the remaining mortage payment, what happens then? And, not having alignment around finances is a bad sign for your relationship's future.", "Ignore the idiots in the comments, OP, but you should probably edit the original post with these info, especially the part about your parents living comfortably, they're just frugal. The Americans are getting their panties in a twist over that, you know, with how bad retirement is for them. Give them some slack.\n\nNTA but girl, run while you still can.", "OP, you may need to add this to the actual post. People tend to forget that reddit is an internationally used app and it's not just Americans posting. \n\nI say NTA.", "> I don't ask anymore because I figured I probably look money hungry which I am not.\n\nYou still asked a couple more times even after it was clear you weren't getting anything from them.\n\n>I am more concerned about the principle of it all. \n\nWhat principle?  They changed their mind.  That's all.  I don't understand what \"principle\" you're so upset about.  Is it that they just didn't tell you they changed their mind?  Okay - that I understand.  They should have come clean to you and told you they didn't want to give you the money anymore.  But aside from that?  Why exactly are you so upset, if it's not about the money?\n\nAre you saying you wouldn't have bought the house without that promise of financial assistance, and now it's too expensive for you?  Then you need to downsize.  It sucks, but they're clearly not going to help you, so you need to help yourself.", "So lying to your family members and potential family members is acceptable behavior. Got it.", "Wary? I'd break up with him over this. The absolute lack of understanding and perspective on the bf's behalf is unacceptable. Laughing at her and calling her materialist? Especially compared to his parents? \n\nYeah, no.", "Honestly, that bothered more than not getting the promised 20 grand. This is who they are OP. NTA", "Worse \u2026 they aren\u2019t even married.", "They have a small home loan which is offset by rental income and that's it", "Our deposit for our little townhouse was CA$96k. It really depends on where one lives.", "My math got the same answer. Wtf?", "Hawaii here, 100k isn't even a 20% down in a house on all except one island... maybe. Someone mentioned OP could be in AUS and to my knowledge their properties are really expensive.", "Generally when you're gifted a lump sum like that for a down payment, there has to be a gift letter from the giver explicitly stating that there is no expectation of repayment. My parents were very generous and have my wife and I money for our down payment and we had to get gift letters from both of them or else the bank would not issue the mortgage.", "She is not married. Who in the world buys a house with a boyfriend at age 25 ?!!", "The in-laws absolutely should have communicated that they changed their minds.  But OP continued to ask about the money even after it was clear that they weren't offering any more.  Why?  It's clear she felt entitled to it somehow.  But she's not.  People are allowed to change their minds, especially about a monetary gift of this magnitude.\n\nWhile the in-laws should have been adult enough to tell her, maybe they thought she'd try to harangue them into giving her the money anyway.  That's kind of what she's already doing anyway.", "It is about commitment. They are buying a house with a thirty year mortgage before they have made a life commitment to each other. You are likely to lose money in the first five to ten years if try to turn around and sell a home.   Seriously putting the cart before the horse.  Houses are more than just paying rent.", "I\u2019m 61 and FAR from elderly. Yeah, it strikes a nerve.", "Then why are they still bringing it up on multiple occasions?", "Did he know you had a paper trail? Wondering if he gave you any credit at all.", "The fact that you realize this is amazing. There are so many people who do not recognize this privilege.", ">Expecting gifts is usually not a solid financial plan anyway.\n\nNo, but when you promise someone a large amount of money to use on something specific, they plan and budget around that, and then when the time comes to give them the money and you don't, that's what we call a dick move.", "If you live on the west coast (not California) you are looking at spending at least 100k for a 20% deposit if you want a decent home these days.", "Instead of giving you 20 k that you would share with a bf , they should have given you good advice to Not buy a house with a bf at age 24.", "Sounds like she\u2019s the only one bringing it up and getting shut down\n\nShe brought it up to BF and he shut it down. She brought it up two more times. And then embarrassingly she asks when the mom is there!  Now BF is an ass and tells mom. Mom is an ass and said no. E\nHave pride. Stop asking. \n\nEdit. More reasons to stop asking.", "Depends on various factors including how the deed is recorded. If their ownership is recorded as \u201cjoint tenants with rights of survivorship\u201d, the surviving owner will be the only owner. Other kinds of joint ownership exist & OP should consult their own lawyer to see what their rights are.", "Not necessarily. When my bf and i bought a house it's in the mortgage contract, i can't remember the terminology but the lawyer explained that it's set up so that if one of us passes then our stake in the deed and mortgage responsibility pass to the remaining owner, not next of kin.", "Almost certainly OP didn't protect themselves.", "I am saying it is wise to know what risks are there and protect yourself before making a 30 year, 6+ figure commitment. OP has already bought the house with her partner, the parents money has been applied, the paperwork was \\*probably\\* not in place to preserve that down payment with her and now she is learning some ugly truths about her partner. That is unfortunate.", "We lived in a community property state, so he believed that he would get half of my money and assets just on the basis of being married to me for 5 years. It doesn\u2019t really work like that.", "Yes, but OP can\u2019t control her BF\u2019s parents.  And I\u2019m not entirely convinced BF\u2019s parents agreed to this gift-matching plan.", "I think it is common knowledge. But when advised it\u2019s always \u201coh we are getting married soon; we\u2019ve been together for years; etc etc\u201d because they  think it can\u2019t possibly happen to them! Until it does.", "If you\u2019re living in the US, then all the people you know are idiots then, lol", "I'm sorry did you just not read the last paragraph or am I hallucinating it?", "It says right in the first paragraph that his parents agreed.", "Exactly. That is why I always raise an eyebrow when someone talks about losing everything in a divorce.", "We can't possibly know that. All we have are the facts OP presented, and she says they agreed", "I don't live in the US, so you'll have to elaborate why they'd be idiots?", "I gave my judgment and my reasons. I\u2019m done.", "What paragraph.  The last one she\u2019s bitchinf about them not giving it to her.", "It also says that op and the boyfriend decided that his parents had to gift money too because hers did. If they didn\u2019t want to give a gift, that\u2019s there right. Op seems greedy", "2 years de facto = a marriage in Australia.", "How long have you lived with him of those 7 years?", "And this is how he treats your after 7 years??", "And he let his parents laugh right in your face and calls you materialistic.\n\nDespite dating 7 years, you were just a teen when this relationship started, and you're still young.\nBuying a house with a boyfriend is a huge risk, specially if he diminish your concerns and he and his family mocks you.\n\nNTA but before you keep going on with that relationship you should make a hard and deep re-evaluation, ask yourself where is your relationship and what is what you want. You might love him, does he loves you? Are you okay with the love he is showing you? He doesn't respect you, his family don't respect you, do you want to keep going on with this? Because this will not magically get better. People don't change habits just because you deserve better than that.", "Yup\u2026 from what I\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s how assholes talk when one spouse was a stay at home parent and the other spouse is salty that they have to settle their debt on all the years of using somebody for unpaid labor.", "Obviously I\u2019m just speculating. The description of the phone call that OP gives is very odd and certainly does not sound like someone had agreed to a $20K gift.", "Yeah. Sounds like OP and BF agreed about asking them to match, and then asked BF's parents, and the parents also agreed.\n\nWhen you're planning a budget around having an extra $20k, it's a dick move to rescind that offer after the fact without telling anyone, and then laugh and mock OP when she followed up on it\n\nWith interest, taxes, and insurance that's at least an extra $150-200 a month toward the house over the course of a 30 year loan, assuming they would dump the money right into their mortgage.", "1. If it wasn\u2019t offered they should have never asked. 2. You should never budget on something you don\u2019t have because there\u2019s a chance you won\u2019t get it. 3. Maybe the parents put stipulations on giving the money that op left out. 4. I do agree that it was a dick move on the parents part, her boyfriend needs to be the one who asks", "1. Thats on the boyfriend\n2. You should never promise someone something you can't or won't follow through on, especially with that large of an amount of money\n3. We can't possibly know that, all we have is what the OP told us\n4. She didn't ask the parents directly. She told the boyfriend to and I assume he put her on speaker so the mom could hear without her realizing because he's the biggest asshole in this situation\n\nI think at this point, OP needs to dump the guy, and cut her losses. Either make him buy out her equity in the house or have a court ordered sale as co-owner."]}
