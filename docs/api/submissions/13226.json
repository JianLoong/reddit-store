Its no secret that gathering a deposit for a house is not easy. While we saved up 80% of it, my parents also gifted us $20k. \nMy Bf and I discussed when my parents gifted us the funds towards our deposit that his parents would also gift this (agreed my his parents), but they would give it to us after we moved in since we already had enough for the deposit for the house we wanted. I understand that I am very privileged to have this issue so this is why I am struggling within myself about whether I should even be concerned about this.\n\nTo give some background, when I was growing up, my parents were low wage earners and we lived paycheck to paycheck every single week. My parents worked extremely hard and lived frugally to pay off their mortgage. They never go on holidays, rarely buy expensive things and live very simply, working towards retirement as they are in their 60s. On the other hand, my BFs parents who are a lot younger than my parents have their own business, that is highly profitable and they live a very comfortable, lavish life. Think buying a new BMW and Merc and then not liking the Merc so buying a Porsche instead, spending $50k on a holiday, and spending $30k on an anniversary party, all in the span of 6 months. Overall, no money troubles at all. \n\nSo cut to us moving to our house, BFs parents gave us $500, their old washing machine and a vacuum cleaner. I was grateful, but I couldn't help but question, if their offer was still on the table as we wanted to fix a few things in our house, eg a huge leak in our bathroom wall. I asked my BF what was happening and he got extremely defensive saying how dare I ask this question and telling me how materialistic I was. He was also with his mum at this time that I was unaware of and he proceeded to tell him mum while I was on the phone that \"OP is upset that you haven't given us $20k like her parents did, are you still going to?\" and they had a laugh about it. I have since asked twice and again I have been dismissed and been told that I should not have ridiculous expectations and that his parents shouldn't have to match what my parents did. I also mentioned to my bf that I felt it was rude when his mother showed me the 3 designer bags that she had purchased as well as all the gold and diamond jewellery while on holiday, right after I mentioned that the increases on our mortgage payments were really starting to pinch. Again, I was told that I have no right to question this. \n\nI would not have cared if they didn't gift us anything if they didn't say on many occasions that they would give what my parents did,  if they didn't invite all of their friends over to my house warming that I was not aware of, and if they were struggling financially (I help with the family business so am very across their financial).
