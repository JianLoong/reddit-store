Its no secret that gathering a deposit for a house is not easy. While we saved up 80% of it, my parents also gifted us $20k. \nMy Bf and I discussed when my parents gifted us the funds towards our deposit that his parents would also gift this (agreed my his parents), but they would give it to us after we moved in since we already had enough for the deposit for the house we wanted. I understand that I am very privileged to have this issue so this is why I am struggling within myself about whether I should even be concerned about this.\n\nTo give some background, when I was growing up, my parents were low wage earners and we lived paycheck to paycheck every single week. My parents worked extremely hard and lived frugally to pay off their mortgage. They never go on holidays, rarely buy expensive things and live very simply, working towards retirement as they are in their 60s. On the other hand, my BFs parents who are a lot younger than my parents have their own business, that is highly profitable and they live a very comfortable, lavish life. Think buying a new BMW and Merc and then not liking the Merc so buying a Porsche instead, spending $50k on a holiday, and spending $30k on an anniversary party, all in the span of 6 months. Overall, no money troubles at all. \n\nSo cut to us moving to our house, BFs parents gave us $500, their old washing machine and a vacuum cleaner. I was grateful, but I couldn't help but question, if their offer was still on the table as we wanted to fix a few things in our house, eg a huge leak in our bathroom wall. I asked my BF what was happening and he got extremely defensive saying how dare I ask this question and telling me how materialistic I was. He was also with his mum at this time that I was unaware of and he proceeded to tell him mum while I was on the phone that \"OP is upset that you haven't given us $20k like her parents did, are you still going to?\" and they had a laugh about it. I have since asked twice and again I have been dismissed and been told that I should not have ridiculous expectations and that his parents shouldn't have to match what my parents did. I also mentioned to my bf that I felt it was rude when his mother showed me the 3 designer bags that she had purchased as well as all the gold and diamond jewellery while on holiday, right after I mentioned that the increases on our mortgage payments were really starting to pinch. Again, I was told that I have no right to question this. \n\nI would not have cared if they didn't gift us anything if they didn't say on many occasions that they would give what my parents did,  if they didn't invite all of their friends over to my house warming that I was not aware of, and if they were struggling financially (I help with the family business so am very across their financial).

Check out the book \"Why Does He Do That?\" by Lundy Bancroft.", "NTA, but you still need to accept that you aren't going to see that money in a way that is actually productive to a future with this guy or in this family.\n\nYou bought a house with someone you are not married to, using your own funds and funds from your parents with the expectations that his parents would also give you funds after closing? You're also helping out with his family business?\n\nDid you contribute equal amounts to the home or do you now have $20K more equity in a home than he does despite it being in both of your names? Did you otherwise contribute equally (the way this is written it sounds like you jointly put down $80k)? What happens if you break-up?\n\nSimilarly, are you getting paid fairly for the work you are doing for his family? Or are you \"just helping out the family\" with no compensation? Again, what happens if you don't work out or even if you do but you never reap the rewards of a family business since you are not family?\n\nYou also mention mortgage payments are \"starting to pinch.\" Did the two of you actually take on the kind of house that makes sense for you with your incomes and stage of life? Or did you take on more than you can reasonably afford? Given that you aren't married, the standard rule is to only purchase property one person can afford on their own/ that one person has the ability to buy from the other or that can be easily resold in case of a break-up? If the market crashes such that it is hard to sell the home and neither of you can afford the mortgage payments on your own, you're going to end up in a very difficult situation. \n\nFurthermore, you say, \"My Bf and I discussed when my parents gifted us the funds towards our deposit that his parents would also gift this (agreed my his parents), but they would give it to us after we moved in since we already had enough for the deposit for the house we wanted.\" And you mention that they said they were giving this money many times over to you. How did this all come about? Did they offer or did your boyfriend ask? Were explicit amounts mentioned before they agreed or did they just say they'd match what your parents' matched (perhaps thinking your parents gave a lot less)? Was a timeline agreed to or was it \"sometime after you bought the house\"? How much of this was said directly to you and how much has been filtered through your boyfriend?  Was everyone present and sober when agreements were made and discussed? Do you even know for sure they didn't give your boyfriend $20K that he stashed or forgive a $20K loan they'd made to him in the past? Unless this was all very clear cut it's entirely possible they thought they were helping out in some other way (like giving him $20K more in inheritance, paying off a vehicle they bought him, putting more toward a future wedding, etc.). \n\nIt sounds like the much bigger issue is that you're pretending to be married to someone you aren't actually married to and you're assuming his family operates like yours does. This is going to cause a whole host of problems unless the two of you worked with individual lawyers on both sides and have some pretty clear cut legal agreements. This is precisely why people say not to buy a house with someone you aren't married to. This was a potentially very foolish financial decision.\n\nYou need to think about your goals for this relationship and for how finances will be looked at now and in the future. Because if you go to him now and establish any money from your parents are \"your\" contribution and any money from his parents as \"his\" there are some implications. That's absolutely fair in the present, your parents have contributed more. But it does set the precedent for how future money is handled too (inheritance, wedding gifts, etc.) In other words, you can look at it like your parents gave him $10K and you $10K or you can look at it like your parents gave you $20K. If your parents gave you $20K, then you contributed an additional $20K assuming he'd be contributing an additional $20K from his parents. Which means you are absolutely getting used. Either way, I don't think you're going to get the money from his parents by pushing harder (and you'll just get labeled a gold digger here). If it was just a verbal agreement I'd assume it isn't coming and then know not to make future plans based on what they say they'll do for you. Meanwhile, you and he can decide as a couple how to handle the discrepancy in what you each contributed. There are fair ways to do this (example: he pays slightly more toward the mortgage, utilities, and home repairs until it comes out even, or you two sit down with lawyers and draw up an ownership agreement that gives you a higher percentage of equity in the home, or you consider that 20K a loan from your parents to both of you and draw up and agreement/ he pays them 10K back). But some of those ways assume you'll be together for a long time. Given that you are unmarried, not respected by his family, and still fairly young, that's a pretty big assumption/ gamble you just made.\n\nI'd guess you end up learning a harsh lesson about buying property with someone you aren't married to when the two of you inevitably break-up and the he walks away having gotten 50% of a home he didn't contribute 50% to and free labor at his families' business to marry someone he actually respects, likes, and treats well around his family.", "Bf's family sounds suspect as hell, and personally I wouldn't have co-ownership of anything with my girlfriend.

Sell the house and get away while you can. \n\nIf you can't protect your investment, you'll have to decide if you want to stay with someone who sees you as a resource, not a partner. $20k is a lot to lose, but if you stay, you may well end up losing more. At the very least, make sure all future improvements to the house and all major purchases of any kind and legally documented to record who paid for what. \n\nAnd for heaven's sake, don't make babies with this guy.
