I'm okay now but I had to take time off from school and I lost my right eye.  The whole healing process sucks. I had to wear a temporary fake eye for about six weeks.  I hated it. I won't describe it here but it was disgusting.  \n\nI have something called an ocular implant in the socket.  It is permanent and it was put in surgically.  \n\nI have a sort of shell that fits over it that is painted to look like my missing eye. And it moves.  But not synced up with my good eye. People always give me a weird look when they notice and I have enough scars already that I have to explain.  \n\nI love the MCU and I kind of think that Nick Fury is a total badass.  So I have been wearing eye patches.  I like them and I can coordinate them to what I'm wearing.  Everyone in my university that knows me knows why I wear a patch so no one bugs me about it.  I am now in my last year, finally, of university and I am doing an internship. Everyone I work with knows why I wear a patch. \n\nThe only person that hates my patch is my mom.  She thinks that it \"shows off my trauma\". LoL. I'm pretty sure the scars on my face do that.  Regardless she told me not to wear my eye patch when I come home for Thanksgiving.  I told her that I would absolutely be wearing an eye patch.  \n\nSo now we are fighting.  She says I'm willfully disobeying her to make her look bad with the family, she was driving but not responsible for the accident.  I told her it's my face and I get to decide what I wear on it. And if she kept bugging me about it I would just skip coming home and go to my boyfriend's parents' for Thanksgiving.  \n\nHuge fight.  So am I an asshole for not doing what my mom wants and not wearing a cool eye patch?", "created_utc": 1668718935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy1i9o/aita_for_getting_an_eye_patch/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
