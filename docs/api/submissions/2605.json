So I have been wearing eye patches.  I like them and I can coordinate them to what I'm wearing.  Everyone in my university that knows me knows why I wear a patch so no one bugs me about it.  I am now in my last year, finally, of university and I am doing an internship. Everyone I work with knows why I wear a patch. \n\nThe only person that hates my patch is my mom.  She thinks that it \"shows off my trauma\". LoL. I'm pretty sure the scars on my face do that.  Regardless she told me not to wear my eye patch when I come home for Thanksgiving.  I told her that I would absolutely be wearing an eye patch.  \n\nSo now we are fighting.  She says I'm willfully disobeying her to make her look bad with the family, she was driving but not responsible for the accident.  I told her it's my face and I get to decide what I wear on it.
