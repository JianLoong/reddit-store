I ended up offering the aisle to my bf somewhat randomly and he asked me why the sudden change of heart. Told him about this post and the responses and he said, \u201cyou know, you shouldn\u2019t have done that to yourself!\u201d Talking about opening myself up to judgement from the internet, lol.\n\nHe didn\u2019t \u2018force\u2019 me to pay for the flight as some have suggested, I did it out of love. But as we were worried the flight would be full, neither one of us thought about the seating arrangement(s). That was just an oversight. My social anxiety is actually due to my ASD, but I didn\u2019t think that was going to be picked apart as hard as it was.\n\nAnyways- after he saw how torn I was about this, he offered to pay for our upgrades at $750 per seat for economy plus, and I will take the middle seat there. All the comments suggesting that we\u2019re unhappy or don\u2019t love each other did upset me, but thankfully I have someone like him to bring me back down to earth and help me log off. \n\n\u2014-\n\nOk, this feels kind of dumb to even write but here we go. My boyfriend (30m) and I (30f) will be on a 15 hour long flight in 2 weeks. It\u2019s both of our first international flights, and both seats are in economy.\n\nFor a tiny bit of context: he and I have been together for 4 years, but we did split up for about 3 weeks, around 6 months ago. This is relevant because this is when I booked this flight for myself, I guess I was trying to do a whole \u2018Eat Pray Love\u2019 thing to cope. When we reconciled and I told him about the trip, he expressed interest in joining me and I was more than happy to have him along.\n\nWhen I booked the flight, I picked an aisle seat for myself. I\u2019m small in stature at 5\u2019 tall while he is a tall guy at around 6\u2019 7\u201d. I didn\u2019t even think a seat on my flight would be available since I was booking his trip a few weeks after mine, so when I saw that one was, we decided to book it right away without really considering the seating arrangement.\n\nFast forward to now- we\u2019re doing our trip prep things and it suddenly hits him like a ton of bricks, \u201cwait, what\u2019s my seat assignment again?\u201d When he sees that his assigned seat is in the middle-ish (it\u2019s a 4-seat row) he immediately asks me to switch with him.\n\nI told him no, that I don\u2019t want to sit in the middle. Mainly this is because of social anxiety and all the other general reasons that people hate the middle seat on long plane rides\u2026but now he\u2019s really guilt tripping me, saying stuff like \u201cwell you know I\u2019m going to have to get up to stretch my legs a thousand times during this\u201d and, \u201cif the roles were reversed, I\u2019d do it for you.\u201d (That statement genuinely makes zero sense to me considering the content of this discussion, but I digress.)\n\nAITA for not wanting to switch with him for my own comfort? Should I let him have the aisle seat?\n\nEDIT: for additional context. I paid for this flight, it is 100% free for him. And I did offer to give him the aisle seat on the return flight as a compromise, but he\u2019s kind of getting at wanting it for both legs. We are not fighting about this, him being mopey about it just makes me feel guilty.", "created_utc": 1696958794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174qtj8/aita_for_not_giving_my_bf_the_aisle_seat/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In my opinion, he\u2019s being pretty immature about the situation. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I see his point of view. I hate flying.

But I suggest you just cancel his ticket and get a refund, if possible. Then inform him that he is now free to arrange his own travel in whatever way works best for him, but you will *not* play along with his mopey-baby behavior because him acting like a child is a complete turn-off, so you don\u2019t want to encourage that in any way.

International flights in economy suck for many reasons. Your discomfort (physical and emotional) is only going to be marginally affected by a middle seat; his discomfort will be much much much worse in a middle seat.\n\nHowever:\n\n- You planned a solo trip when you guys had broken up, and bought and chose seats for your tickets.\n- When he wanted to go with you once you were together again, you did the legwork and found, booked, and paid for his tickets.\n- He didn't tell you at the time you were booking his tickets and choosing seats that he needed the aisle.\n\nIt's a slight NTA because you're paying for everything. However, his physical discomfort will be extreme and you're also going to share in the extra misery. So while it might not be fair according to \"they're all your tickets\" logic, it's probably in your best interests to let him be in the aisle seats. \n\nYou could try contacting the airline.

Maybe you might wanna get some leg room and work that out, bro.", "Going for the throat on this one lol", "I\u2019m not defensive lol I find it quite odd some stranger on the internet wants to come at me with ignorant remarks trying to test me on what I do or do not know on an AITA sub. Want me to send you my past international itineraries? I gave her good options for what to do and you\u2019re hung up on one point from your experience. Let it go", "Have fun rotting your brain on gacha. I should\u2019ve checked the post history sooner. Why even bother talking to someone who plays genshin \ud83d\ude2d", "Glad you worked it out. \n\nThat said, based on your initial post, I would not get married. To him or anyone. \n\nI don\u2019t think your are capable of the selflessness or compromise that is often called for in marriage. Many people are far far happier alone.", "YTA, its your  boyfriend and human, he will suffer and you must care.", "I've never flown with someone, esp on such a long haul without making sure I was close to the person I wanted to fly with.  \n  \nYTA. I don't really want to understand people who pull such petty games on folks they pretend to like. Glad the red flags are flown so high / proudly though.   \n  \nMove on, he ain't getting shorter.", "Uh, yeah, YTA and tbh you come across as a stupid little shit too. Like \u201cdurr hurr i no ur 19 inches taller then me but oh well sucks too suck.\u201d No wonder you guys broke up. It\u2019ll be shocking if it doesn\u2019t happen again.", "YTA.  His stature makes the additional space of an aisle seat important.  The loss of comfort for him is much greater than the loss of comfort for you.", "gf gets everything on a 15hr flight unless im oversized/ stinky/ useless/ pretends to pee all the time or have a bathroom issue/ just suck at being a partner. gtfo of the way if i gotta piss ill gladly take the window or middle. people dont bother me, ill bother them.", "Why can\u2019t you take turns with the aisle seat?", "NTA\n\n>  \u201cwell you know I\u2019m going to have to get up to stretch my legs a thousand times during this\u201d\n\nNo, fuck that. He takes a muscle relaxant and an anxiolytic, and stays put.", "NTA, People saying you\u2019re awful for this are just stupid. You bought him the ticket after you got back together and was able to purchase that seat because it was available, you didn\u2019t go out of your way to get him a crappier seat. \nIt\u2019s also not your fault he\u2019s gigantic just like it\u2019s not his fault you have social anxiety and can\u2019t bear the idea of being surrounded by people. It\u2019s a free ticket, he should be grateful, If he\u2019s not happy about it he can try to get the seat changed himself, not try to manipulate you into doing even more for him.", "OP you can always try and change your seat when you check in. My husband calls it musical chairs. People drop out etc and sometimes new seats become available.", "NTA. I need the aisle. Also for a 15 hour flight I bring earplugs and 2 sleeping pills so I\u2019m out for 9 hours and it helps me to deal", "NTA. Yes he will be uncomfortable in the middle seat because he is tall, but you will ALSO be uncomfortable in the middle seat because of your social anxiety (which is completely and totally valid btw). He is caring more about his comfort than your comfort. You are the one who bought the tickets. You could compromise and switch seats halfway through, or he could spend more to upgrade his seat.", "NTA. You paid for 100% he didnt pay for anything. He can go kick rocks", "NTA who told him to agree to a 15 hour plane ride without making sure he was going to b comfortable? \nHe can either pay for a comfy seat or deal with it.", "And she's paying for it! He doesn't get to dictate which seat he gets on his *free* vacation.", "I have zero confidence he'd give up the seat when it's her turn, but regardless, OP is paying so OP gets dibs on which seat she wants. He can offer to pay for the ticket if it matters to him so much.", "I'm 5'2\" and I either book a window seat or isle seat. Best believe I'm not giving either up to anyone. I would feel unbelievably trapped in a middle seat. Mentally I can not handle the middle seat. Sorry, not sorry. Plan better or pay for the upgrade. Period. Your physical discomfort does not out weigh my emotional discomfort, which by the way turns into my skin crawling so physical discomfort too.", "What a saint!", "This one made me laugh!", "Two aisle seats work nicely for couples traveling on planes with three or more seats on each side of the aisle", "See I disagree with this. Everyone hates the middle seat. It\u2019s shittier than the aisle/window for the shorter person too. Just because she\u2019s shorter doesn\u2019t mean she should get stuck there EVERY time. It\u2019s not like tall single people never buy the middle seat on flights. We all have to squeeze in there sometimes. \n\nWhen couples fly together they can put up the armrest between them and squish together so they can make a lot better use of their 2 seats together than if each just had 1, so it\u2019s a lot better than when you\u2019re single anyways. And if it\u2019s such a big deal, they can pay for the extra leg room seats.", "Sounds like she's dating a scrub", "My dad was 6\u20198\u201d, my mom was 6\u20193\u201d and I think about 3/4 of that is legs lol, she wears a 34 or 35 inseam (though she\u2019s now 5\u201911\u201d due to many fractures in her back). I\u2019m barely 5\u20191 and I\u2019ve watched how uncomfortable they\u2019ve been in cars, on flights, etc. Even if they weren\u2019t my parents, I\u2019d give them an aisle seat just because it\u2019s easy to see how uncomfortable they are crammed in places. They always tried to get an exit row or the bulkheads if they could for more room. I can\u2019t even imagine how uncomfortable it must be for someone tall to sit in economy for an overseas flight", "This 100%. Not all problems mean break up. Tho i think he could just pay the difference for a seat change I can definitely see why he\u2019d feel a little bad ab being in a middle seat as tall as he is.", "You\u2019re the one that started your post with \u201cas a woman, you can\u2019t understand\u201d, jackass.", "The worst part is if someone in front of you reclines their seat. My knees are already touching the seat in front of me in economy, anyone reclining makes it unbearable.", "Of course the middle seat is shittier for the shorter person too. I hate that usually I've got men's legs taking up a third of my space on either side, leaving me with knees and elbows constrained the whole time. But I guess my reasoning goes something like, short me starts at a 4/10 comfort level in an aisle cattle class seat and very tall bf starts with 2/10. I take a 2 point hit with a middle seat; tall bf takes at least a 2 point hit. So my experience goes to \"really uncomfortable\" and his goes to \"torture\". I'd rather both of us were similarly really uncomfortable.\n\nActually, I'd rather we could afford business class. The economy cabin sucks, plain and simple, and all this discussion is just about how to make it not quite as hellish.", "Men and women have different morphology.\n\nI won't tell you periods don't hurt if you don't tell me what it's like being a 210 lbs, 6'1\" mesomorph trying to squeeze into an airplane seat.\n\nSeriously - are you really this thick, or are you trying to win an argument for the sake of winning?  Go reread what I wrote, maybe repetition is the path to success for you.", "So a 6\u201d1 210 pound woman would be perfectly comfy in a middle seat?  I\u2019m not the one that brought sex into the conversation, jackass.  That was you.  Now stop trying to backtrack sideways and insult me because you embarrassed yourself.", "Did you read the post?\n\n>I\u2019m small in stature at 5\u2019 tall while he is a tall guy at around 6\u2019 7\u201d\n\nShe's a midget.  She has no idea how much discomfort tall people experience in those seats.  I don't think she's going to grow 13 inches, and put on 80 lbs to be able to have context for where those seats start getting really uncomfortable.\n\nSo, it's not about sex; it's sexual dimorphism that's the issue.\n\nAnd you're the one who's being insulting: jackass, insult yourself?\n\nLearn to read.  Learn to think.  Learn not to be a antagonistic harridan.", "Moot means it is still on the table for discussion and therefore relevant.", "Dude.  You came at me accusing me of \u201cmaking it about sex\u201d when YOU did that.  Blathering on doesn\u2019t change the facts.", "Ok - let's start this over, because clearly my initial point hasn't been communicated.\n\nDo you know what sexual dimorphism is, and what that looks like in humans?"]}
