I\u2019m excited about my pregnancy and, boy or girl, I hope my child never experiences the agony that mom, sister and I did. I won\u2019t discuss this further.\u201d", "First of all, mystery period pain sufferers unite. I understand you and your agony 100000%. \n\nNTA. I'm struggling to understand how your aunt got you 'hate your baby' from your explanation. Is she always this dramatic? Does she struggle to find excitement in her life and therefore tries to create something out of literally nothing? Are her favorite soap operas off season and she's trying to live out some live-action drama out of sheer boredom? Does she genuinely have nothing better to do? This is bizarre and ridiculous. She needs to go sit down somewhere.", "Your reasoning for hoping your child is a boy is totally reasonable. Every parent worries about possible health issues that could be passed down to them. But I will say that the phrasing \"I hope my child is a boy because you know how we are\" sounds horribly sexist. I'm going to go with NTA because your aunt just doesn't seem to want to hear your actual intent, but god that wording was terrible!", "AY TA because you don't want your child to suffer? \n\nNo, you are not.\n\nNTA", "I was ready to YTA your ass lol but given from my skimming you meaning your family history regarding female health and not 'boys are easier to raise' ima go with NTA", "NTA and what are any of you going to do about it if the child is female? Nothing. It sounds like your relatives are searching for an excuse to lecture you.", "NAH. \n\nI get your point, but it\u2019s also pretty understandable why someone without the context of your periods might be upset with what you said. There are lots of adults who genuinely are upset with the sex of their baby, and it\u2019s a really shitty thing for them to believe.", "Saw the title and was like woah thats uncool but after reading, absolutely NTA. Also your aunt is proving what I always say, that sometimes cis women who have never experienced debilitating periods are more dismissive than cis men who have never had any period at all. I get you. Bad periods are awful and it's not unreasonable to hope your child will never have to experience that. But I hope if your kid does have to put up with that that treatment options have improved by the time they start periods.", "NTA at all, they're the sexist ones for continuing the 'all women have period pain' myth and refusing to listen to how yours is quite staggeringly difficult.\n\nIt's exactly the same if your family had a genetic disorder that only affected men. You'd be hoping for a girl.", "NTA. I completely understand, as I have Endometriosis and my periods are horrible. You were just thinking about the difficulties, not being hateful.", "NTA. Severe period pain is debilitating.  Like you I\u2019ve been there. I ended up having a hysterectomy. My daughter is 10 now and I worry she will go through this as well. I\u2019ll never forget the agony I used to be in. I love her to pieces and wouldn\u2019t change her for the world. You\u2019re clearly coming from a place of love too.", "I had to have a hysterectomy two years ago because of fibroids and adenomyosis.  I get it. I was so anemic I was in the hospital getting infusions every two weeks. My daughter is 18 and has bad periods too. I hear ya.  And yes of course you\u2019ll adore whatever you have. I have one of each and both have been such a blessing and a joy.  Down the road though get yourself to a women\u2019s clinic and get some good help.  I was a mess for 10 years.  If men dealt with this crap there would be research centres on every corner.", "NTA, as long as you were joking.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s okay to have preferences, you want a boy, which is 100% fine so long as you still give the same amount of love to the child if it ends up not being the case, which  you seem to prove in this post.", "Holy crap that's bad wording, lol.  Why not just hope for a child without debilitating period pain?  It's not really wanting a boy so much as not wanting your child to suffer the way the three of you did. \n\nI'm not sure why your sister recounted (not recanted!) the anecdote to your aunt.\n\nYour aunt is an AH for not listening to your explanation, but not for reacting to the wording.  Maybe write her a letter? Either her periods aren't as bad or she thinks it's normal, but either way, having context to your statement may help.", "NTA", "NTA, your aunts misunderstood and they need to stop talking and just listen to you. FYI the kind of period pain you talk about is not something every woman goes through and it's not being anti-female to be concerned about passing that on.", "NTA.\n\n\"Aunt, nowhere did I say that I would hate my child if it were a girl. What was said is that I'd hope for a boy so my daughter didn't have to experience the extreme amount of debilitating pain Mom, Sister and I have had to deal with all of our lives. I'd keep my child from having to stay bed bound for days at a time because the pain is so bad we couldn't even walk, let alone stand up from the fetal position. I appreciate where you are coming from, but in the future make sure you have the *full* story instead of the made up narrative you have now. So, no, I will *not* be meeting up with you and Aunt 2 so that you can gang up on me for something that boils down to a misunderstanding.\"", "NTA as some people wanted to have a boy or girl.

Otherwise, hoping your girl will be your pride and joy in the future.", "YTA if it's that bad then don't pass on those genes. Even if it's a boy, his daughters could have the same affliction.", "Soft YTA.

If aunt had said, \u201cI think it\u2019s best not to hope either way and just be ready to be happy for either,\u201d that\u2019s how I would have ruled.

Shame! /s\n\nNAH, it sounds like a misunderstanding. I would say bring your sister to the brunch so you can both explain how bad it is and why neither of you want that for your daughters.", "You can\u2019t know someone\u2019s gender before they do.

Your aunt got the wrong end of the stick.", "NTA. I totally get where you are coming from. There is a reason I convinced a doctor to cut that monster out of my body at 31.

I had the same concern for my children (although apparently yours are worse than mine) and both of my girls escaped it. I still only wanted girls and got my wish.

Your aunts are looking for something to complain about.", "NTA \n\nWhen I was pregnant I thought the same. I just wanted a boy.

Such an odd conclusion to come to especially since it isn't uncommon for parents to prefer a certain gender. NTA", "No, she's actually usually very level-headed. However, she feels very protective and strongly about babies and kids, which I think led her to have an emotional response to me. Still though, it's really unlike her to be hung onto something for this long (it's been a week) and to not really listen to my explanation, so I don't know.", "Well, that's why context exists. OP only told that to her sister, who knew exactly what she meant-it was the sister's lack of adding context for the aunt that caused the issue.", "Agreed, it really wasn't my intention to be sexist, I was just making an offhand comment. Still though, definitely something to be more careful about in the future.", "Best point yet!", "Okay, but then when they were told about the context they still accused OP of being sexist or whatever and feel the need to basically host an intervention, so at what point does lacking context excuse their behavior?", "The moment she decided to have a kid it was out of her hand. Idk why she\u2019s acting like her comment was so brave because she can rationalize it. It\u2019s a shitty comment to make. Why not wish for healthy children? She would have had it covered instead of making it a sex thing. The world is shit for a lot of women\u2026we still don\u2019t rationalize it when other people wish they had sons instead", "Agree. If OP feels so strongly about girls suffering this health problem, why have a child when it\u2019s 50% chance of being a girl?", "Oh goodness, that sounds just like me in high school :'( sending well wishes to you, it sucks!!", "Because they want to have a family."]}
