My parents dotted on him and taught me to put his needs above all else. \n\nGrowing up, I never felt important. Everything I did was for my brother. I got high marks, my mom would say it\u2019s for my brother. I won a high jump competition, my brother got to keep the medal. My presents were suited for his needs. Nothing was ever mine. And I was never allowed to touch any of his stuff because that might upset him. \n\nNeedless to say, I came to harbour a sort of frustration, maybe even resentment, toward this setup. I knew it wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s fault, but I couldn\u2019t help hating him. \n\nI knew better to take it out on my brother or my parents who were really just trying their best. So I moved out as soon as I hit college. I\u2019ve felt so free ever since. I visit them twice a year, for maybe a couple days each time, and therefore don\u2019t mind the treatment as much as before. \n\nWell this past Christmas, they decided to surprise me. They came over to my place unannounced and stayed for almost a month. Either all the penned up childhood frustrations compounded or his behaviours got worse, but I snapped by the end because he rummaged around my stuff and broke something every day (some expensive, some of sentimental value). \n\nThat last time, he broke the door to my room and ruined a lot my treasured possessions, I screamed at him to get away from me and that I don\u2019t ever want to see him ever again. I think I even said something along the line of wishing he never existed. My screaming upset my brother, and my words hurt my parents. He threw a tantrum, my parents were stressed. I made a mess.\n\nMy mom has been calling everyday telling how sorry she is that I felt that way but I shouldn\u2019t have held on to such cruel sentiments. She cries for hours on the phone. My dad called a couple of times telling me how disappointed he was in me and how insensitive I had been. I feel extremely guilty but at the same time, I meant every word I said. \n\nI knew it was out of my brother\u2019s control. I knew he probably didn\u2019t mean any ill.

Oh no. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nWhile what you said was hurtful, you didn\u2019t ask for this to happen. You didn\u2019t invite them to show up on your doorstep without your permission. You didn\u2019t ask them to intrude on you in your house.\n\nTo be completely honest with you, it was inevitable that this would happen. Between your parents showing up without your knowledge to your brother completely demolishing your things, your blood slowly boiled inside until you mentally combusted.\n\nThey destroyed your boundaries, but now it\u2019s time to reinforce them. You have let this gone on far too long and have allowed them to walk all over you. The time has come for you to take back your power and to take all the power they had over you away from them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I was going to put ESH -but you were pushed to breaking point, and as I wrote out my response I changed my rating. You shouldn't have said what you did, but most people would have snapped at that point. Your parents are the biggest AHs in this scenario.\n\nThere is no justification for turning up to someone's house unannounced and then staying for a month. None. It doesn't matter what relation you are. They should never have done that, and it was this careless disregard for your home and disrespect for your autonomy that pushed you over the edge. The way they raised you and your brother was terrible, and they haven't changed since you've moved out.\n\nThey're worried about your brother's feelings, but not about yours. Saying you shouldn't feel the way you do as a result of their behaviour is negating both your emotions and their responsibility. \n\nYou clearly did the right thing in moving away and minimising contact, and they decided to force themselves upon you, which they have no right to do. \n\nYou should tell them that you will visit them in order to have family time, and they are never to visit you again. And if they do, they are financially responsible for everything their son breaks. \n\nI might go so far as to move and not give them my new address, but I know what the housing situation is like.", "NTA\n\nThey came for a surprise visit to stay for a MONTH?   Your parents are such huge assholes.   \n\nThey were bad enough to make you sacrifice your childhood to accommodate your brother's special needs, but to the invade your home for a month?\n\nThey are so far out of line I don't think the line's even visible from where they ended up.", "NTA. Not only have you been ignored for your whole life but you parents are so rude to come unannounced and stay for a month. Yes you probably shouldn\u2019t have yelled at your brother but a person can only be dismissed so many times before they snap.\nBTW Do you know what the plans are for your brother after they die? Really think you might want to check that now, as they are probably assuming that you will be his carer.", "NTA. You were basically forgotten, and your parents prioritized his special needs over your own needs. As someone who grew up in a family with a special needs sibling, you're treated as more of a problem than part of the family.", "NTA. Your parents sacrificed you on their alter to your brother. You finally manage to create something for yourself and they turn up *uninvited* and *let your brother ruin things*. And then cry because you hurt their feelings.\n\nThey have done a disservice to you *and* your brother. They may have tried their best but *it wasn't good enough*. Their best was to completely alienate their own child. Their best makes them think that you should just put up with them ruining everything in your life forever. They don't get to make you feel bad that they failed you.", "NTA.  Your parents barged into your life and obviously didn't take enough precautionary measures to protect your personal space from your brother.  Yes it may seem cruel to have blown up on him but we can all only be pushed so far.  Especially since it's clear your parents never worked to try to establish a way to get your bro to not cross boundaries.", "NTA- as someone who grew up with a special needs sibling I experienced something very similar. I also broke at about 40 years old. Family still does not understand me. They don\u2019t seem to understand that my need\u2019s really matter, and everything needed to fit their narrative\u2026.. As someone who is much older than you I will say, it is ok to look out for your best interest, speak up when you are being treated unfairly, and look out for yourself. If someone guilts you for it , and doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries then maybe they shouldn\u2019t be in your life. To be clear this isn\u2019t your brother\u2019s fault. It is the fault of the people who think that his needs and happiness is greater than yours.", "NTA. One can only be pushed so far before having a meltdown and it is sounding like this has been festering for several years.  It is no wonder that you blew up. And who stays uninvited for a freaking month? That is really pushing the envelope.   \n\nConsider this as well: You may have addressed a future issue. I have a feeling they were expecting you to become his caregiver when they pass away so your outburst has put them on notice to make other plans for him. So maybe it was a blessing in disguise.", "NTA.\nI wanna say ETA but your parents coming uninvited to a person's house, and then leaving the special needs Son to do whatever he wants without supervision. Then your dad having the audacity for calling you insensitive. Jesus christ. I reckon apologise to your brother he doesn't really understand what hes doing however your parenta do so go LC or NC with your parents for awhile.", "Man, I really don't know about this one.\n\nWeirdly, I think the biggest asshole move here is showing up at somebody's place unannounced and staying for a month. That's just crazy.", "NTA. They did this. Who surprises someone for a month visit? Mom can cry as much as she wants. Dad can be as disappointed as he wants to be. They were good parents to him at your expense.", "NTA.\n\nOkay what you said sort of was, but your parents created this whole situation and are taking none of the blame. Forget your past even, they showed up unannounced for a *month*. That is not okay ever. I\u2019d even venture to say your parents knew what they were doing because this is intruding on so many levels. Three extra people in a home you\u2019re used to being alone in is absurd. For a MONTH. I honestly would have blown up at my family, and they aren\u2019t autistic. This isn\u2019t your fault. They should never have felt comfortable intruding on your life for so long. Especially unannounced. You\u2019re not the AH because you didn\u2019t ask or condone any of this. You\u2019ve kept your distance to be peaceful and they intruded on that. It doesn\u2019t change just because they are family. You still have a right to say no and make them leave.", "NTA\n\nAnd of course you meant what you said: it's because of your Bro you've come second, gotten no autonomy growing up, no love and no compassion. As you know its really because of your parents but it makes sense that your mind would go there.\n\nYour parents sound very sheepish too. The whole thing about the award; it sounds like anytime your bro wanted something they would just give it to him to keep him for fear of having a meltdown. I've met a lot of parents who are terrified of the ASD kid.\n\nIt sounds like they figured out they are getting older and it's getting harder for them to take care of him. They needed a break, knew you'd say no, so they just showed up (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission).\n\nI'm not sure they are going to ever see how much they wronged you. so yea NC for a long time while you work through your sh!t then LC forever.", "I mean...\n\nTo have the audacity that allows someone to think showing up unexpectedly and staying for a month... A large part of me wonders if this was some secret trial run to see how you'd care for your brother after your parents death. \n\nLook. You probably said some shitty things. We all do that, especially if it's been years of repressed rage.\n\nParenting a special needs kid is hard. The parenting default is to keep the peace... And keeping the peace means keeping the loudest kid quiet and happy. However, that takes away the agency of the kid with different needs and makes an awful assumption that they have no capacity to learn boundaries or even the word NO.\n\nYour parents and sibling needed to be shown the door after a long weekend. They are only welcome for as long as you stay in their home. If they won't take responsibility for your sibling and his behavior, then they shouldn't take him to other people's homes. Your parents need to understand how their audacity and allowing your sibling to destroy everything they touch isn't ok. \n\nThey also should not be pushing their feelings on to you. The only thing that should happen is that they apologize and offer to replace what was broken. It isn't your responsibility to regulate everyone's emotions. \n\nNta", "NTA\nYou are right, it is not your brother's fault, it's your parents', because they n never taught him any boundaries.

Not nice but nta by a long shot.", "Nta. And send them a bill for everything he broke. They enabled that bad behavior they can pay for it. And set a clear boundaries.

They also set you up to resent your brother, even though they didn\u2019t deliberately do it.\n\nI would go LC while you work to sort things out. Your brother, as you know, means no harm. I think it would be very helpful to your healing to have your parents eventually sit in with the professional. Someone needs to set the record straight about what they did while you grew up.", "ESH. Your parents for enabling this behavior and honestly putting your brother at a disadvantage. He will not function well in society.

But, you are nta overall, your parents are..You lost your cool. But you need to have a real conversation with your parents. Set real boundaries. Communicate what you need from them.", "NTA But at this point I think you'd be happiest if you cut all 3 of them out of your life.", "NTA, but your parents sure are. It sounds like they\u2019ve spent most of your brother\u2019s life teaching him that he doesn\u2019t have to follow any rules or show respect to anyone else. Autism or not that\u2019s a huge recipe for disaster. What on earth were they thinking? Now they have an obviously strong enough to break down a door adult man who was never taught to take no for an answer or taught that he needs self control and how to exercise it. This is the kind of situation that ends with these poor neglected young men becoming sex offenders because they haven\u2019t been taught anything by their parents. I have a few friends who have worked in facilities that house men like your brother and those who were never given boundaries and discipline tend to struggle for the rest of their lives. \nBetween the fact that you learned to hate your brother early on and the severity of his out of control behavior I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking guardianship when the time comes. I would ask to be kept up to date on his care and wellbeing, but managing his care in any appropriate facility is going to be an absolute nightmare. If you\u2019re the guardian you will probably be fielding calls all hours of the night. As sad as it is, a state-appointed guardian is likely to be able to pass the problems with his behavior into the facility staff. When your parents pass away or become too old to care for him he is going to have an awful wake-up call because nobody else is going to tolerate this degree of behavior from him. \nI\u2019m so sorry for what your parents put you through. Your brother needed boundaries and rules and he needed to be taught respect for others. You and he were neglected in different ways, unfortunately. You thankfully have the capacity to move on, but your brother will probably always struggle because of your parents refusing to parent him. They should have engaged you in helping him understand sometimes instead of making everything you did about your brother. It sounds like they were overwhelmed and just quit trying because it was hard. Don\u2019t let them stay ever again and don\u2019t agree to take responsibility for your brother\u2019s care because you don\u2019t sound like you could handle it emotionally, which is okay especially considering how you were pitted against each other growing up.", "NTA, who shows up uninvited and stay for a whole month.

Of course you snapped. \n\nThis is one of those times where we may hate how we said it, but the reason behind what we said was real. You said those things for a reason. You didn't mean the hateful words, but the frustration and anger are valid. \n\nKeep boundaries.

Yes. But did your parents need to hear them, and take to heart how their choices have affected you all your life? Absolutely. Is it extremely childish for them to focus on how their feelings are hurt, rather than how much you have been hurting for years in order to get to this point? Massive yes.\n\nThis is going to be hard to hear: you need to reassess your opinion of your parents, and probably your relationship with them. Your parents absolutely did not \u201ctry their best\u201d if they also \u201ctaught (you) to put his needs above all else\u201d, didn\u2019t give you the space to be your own self and didn\u2019t attempt to teach your brother to respect you as your own self.

If their response is to work you this hard with guilt tactics rather than apologize for trashing your place after staying for a month uninvited, then they fall firmly into this category.  \n\n\nOP, if you read this, you're NTA. You made a comment that erupted after your boundaries were stomped - boundaries you put up after nearly three decades of an unhealthy family dynamic. You can't bottle up at least a quarter of a century of that kind of treatment and not explode when pushed that hard. You feel badly about it because you didn't want your brother to feel hurt. But as u/journeyintopressure stated, it's time to limit contact. As someone who went LC and then NC with family, I want to offer these pieces of advice (because I did not know what to do, and I want to be the helping hand for someone who's on that same path):  \n\n\n1. Change your phone number. Yes, it's a pain, because your phone number is attached to so much stuff, but believe me, it's worth it. The dread of your phone ringing or buzzing is something you didn't realize was terrorizing you. The same goes for your email address. If some inconvenience lowers your overall anxiety, then it's worth it.\n2. Let other family members know that you've decided to go no contact. If they can't respect that or start to leak information to your parents, it's time to limit those interactions as well. \n3. Talk to other people about what happened. If you haven't already, get a therapist - they are so incredibly worthwhile, and they will help you discover strength and coping tools you didn't realize you had. Think of it like taking care of your car: just like your car, you need tune-ups as well. You're worth that. Look in the mirror and tell yourself that you deserve it because you're a Cadillac. \n4. Extend talking to other people to friends and neighbors. Let them know what's going on, so that they can be on alert for people showing up. If you own your own house, get cameras. If you rent, talk to your landlord. It will surprise you how many people will want to show up for you.\n5. Don't take the bait. Don't open their letters. Don't read their emails or social media posts (the block button is your friend and exists for a reason). Don't accept their calls. Don't open the door if they show up. That's the most difficult part, especially if they show up thinking that you have to deal with them in the moment. It's easier for an abuser to get a response and wear you down if you're forced to confront them. The beautiful part of being an adult is that they have no authority over you and can't force you to interact. They want to scream? Call the police. They want to show up at work or at a store you frequent? That's what security is paid to deal with. No contact means no contact.\n6. Believe that \"no\" is a complete sentence. Growing up the way you did, your brother had to come first, so the word \"no\" wasn't considered a valid response. Your \"no\" not only matters, it's the final word. \n\nGood luck, OP. Please be kind to yourself.", "Maybe try destroying his things.", "OP was probably conditioned to be doormant by these so called parents and finally snapped after 27 years of being nothing compared to her brother and being forced to play caregiver for someone who isn\u2019t even her child. \n\nNah, she wasn\u2019t cruel.

OP has been guilted her whole life to put her brother's needs before her own, so what's putting her in the will but one last guilt trip to make her think she has no choice?\n\nOP needs to prepare now, make it abundantly clear to her parents that no matter what they put in their will or whatever they say/do, she *will absolutely not* become her brother's carer when they pass no matter what.", "Could the parents be assholes about it in their will? If they put a clause stating that OP's... endowment (if that's the right word) from their will is dependent on them being the full time caretaker of her brother, otherwise it all goes to him; would that stand up in court?", "Exactly, this is what she needs to put her foot down on, because I wouldn't be surprised if the other commenters are correct in saying that her parents turning up unannounced with her brother and staying for a month was a \"trial run\" for future care arrangements.\n\nTbh if OPs brother made himself too comfortable I wouldn't be surprised if their parents tried to leave him at OPs house like \"oh but he's so happy here, much happier than back at home\".", "It can't be forced no, if the person in the will says no then other plans are made.

No nurse would be great at their job or compassionate if they\u2019d have to do this every day without a break, for weeks and months on end. But parents often do have to spend majority of their time off-work - if they even can work, because afaik, lots of families need one parent to stay at home to take care of the special needs child - focusing on the special needs child, leaving them to not provide attention to other kids, themselves, their spouses etc. \n\nI think day cares would potentially be a great solution but these will cost money, which will be expensive. Let\u2019s face it - special needs kids and adults, especially if they cannot manage on their own at all, are seen as a drain on the society, not a benefit; at least in the eyes of those who count the money, so they\u2019d want to pay as little as possible, hence why the burden is placed on the families. \u201cYou wanted kids, they\u2019re your responsibility\u201d is the vibe I\u2019m getting.

Like in the 19th century or something, except that a large share of the people actually lived on a farm or a countryside then and these days, most cannot even afford that.", "Right. What is actually needed is well funded institutions, with well paid and qualified care staff who are routinely monitored for neglect and abuse. \n\nBut that\u2019s expensive, so nobody wants to do that.", "Most everyone finishes college at 22 if going right after High School.

Probably more peeved that their plans didn't go through.", "What the parents in these stories never get is that they are making the other child feel like their whole purpose in life is to care for someone else, that their lives' have no value beyond that.  I don't blame them for going NC with their parents, who wouldn't?", "Very true, people keep telling me that it can't be forced but it doesn't mean that the final blow won't be as devastating OP as her whole life as been.\n\nIf anything it would be the biggest representation to OP that she never did matter to her parents at all.", "Oh definitely, I think OP would benefit from therapy to help her through this and her childhood, or even if she could find a support group for those who were once/are currently in her situation.

Anyway, what's the point of being sanctimonious here? The thing that I wrote is too much of a non sequitur to even be offensive.\n\nI also kind of liked thinking about what makes something a joke.

If not, be **very** clear about what you\u2019re willing to allow in the future and the consequences of this abuse. \n\n\n\nI would: \n\n\n- end up all calls where they complain, emotional blackmail you, scold you or/and throw a non-apology at you (like that \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you should not be feeling xyz\u201d). Clearly say you will discuss matters in a calm manner. They\u2019ll scream, cry, beg, scold\u2026 hold your ground.\n\n\n- send an invoice for the damages and a expected date for they or their insurance to cover them up. I\u2019m petty, so I would warn them that either we settle amongst us or small claims will have to look into the situation. \n\n\n- tell them they are not welcome again unless specifically invited by you and certainly not for such lengthy visits. But honestly I don\u2019t recommend your opening the door to them again. \n\n\n- maybe too harsh, but I\u2019d nip future abuse on the bud, saying that you are sorry they\u2019re facing such a hard situation, but it\u2019s their life. Not yours. Tell them that you understand they want to keep him safe, but that\u2019s *their* responsibility, not yours.

If they need the contact for sending mail or whatever, open up a PO box. \n\n\n- block their numbers as well. Ideally, I\u2019d say get a new number. \n\n\n- I\u2019d say you\u2019re sorry you yelled, but you meant everything you said.

I\u2019d say that yeah, it\u2019s hard to have a special needs child.

All your life, you were told you weren\u2019t important, that only he mattered. It\u2019s not true, OP. You **are** important. You are entitled to your own life, as you want to live it. This is a hill to die on. I wish you a very fulfilling and abuse free life.", "NTA. But why would you let them stay with you for a month when he\u2019s breaking shit.

OP is an adult who should have managed the unannounced visit like an adult and put a stop to it long before exploding in a hurtful tantrum. As adults, we\u2019re responsible for drawing boundaries and enforcing them. Even if we weren\u2019t allowed to as children.", "> They destroyed your boundaries\n\nI guess they never had them.

And even if they make amends, I would never allow them entry in your home again and keep visits to a minimum or not at all.

Parents who gave in to every whim of their child because either it was easier or because they were stuck in survival mode, doing what it takes to get though each day. Then the kid becomes an adult and no one can work with them because their behaviour is out of control. I\u2019ve seen men call 911 when a support worker refuses to give them something (like the support workers own possessions) because the parents never said no. \n\nIt will get worse once OP\u2019s parents pass.

This shows how they conditioned her to follow their demands... \nOP has to learn that she has value and deserves boundaries and safe spaces.

It's hard, but worth it.", "Also at 30 I feel he should be able to not break things that are in someone else bedroom. Being autistic doesn\u2019t make you a complete idiot. I do believe that their may be an extreme area of the spectrum and I can\u2019t speak on that part, but autism for the most part affects social cues but fully expressed boundaries are different.

OP stayed away for years, they started to worry that they \u201clost\u201d their de facto caretaker, and wanted to reestablish their old ties (that bind).  OP - after you get really calm, and have sorted through things in your mind, talk to them.  Firmly, calmly.  Tell them they may never come to your home uninvited again.  If they ever are invited again they must be able to control older brother better.  And then tell them - calmly - how awful your childhood was for you, that you have no intention of revisiting it EVER, and that if they are considering making you responsible for your older brother at some point in the future they need to rethink that idea and make other arrangements because you refuse.

I do a pretty dangerous job and yet somehow more than half the scars on my body are from him / my mother.\n\n\nMy brothers actually in a very good place right now and is capable of living on his own and holding a decent job but that took a lot of work and undoing all of the enabling my mother had done.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the turning point was someone finally snapping at him and being violent in return. It seemed to be a huge slap in the face / wake up call that in the real world he couldn't always get what he wanted.", "NTA, I completely understand how you feel as a 27 year old guy who has an older brother 30 years old with autism & OCD. Our situations are very similar my parents doted on my brother & made sure we knew he was special. Where our situations differ is how your parents would give your brother your trophies & achievements in a sense. This could lead to a level of resentment I am unfamiliar with where my childhood my toys/things were my own & my brothers toys/things were his own. This was a little parenting mistake by your mom & dad which they probably have never fully realized.\n\nBeing a parent to a kid with special needs is very very tough but being a parent to a mix of kids one being special & one not is almost an impossible balance to raise your kids exactly how you would want to. I can tell you're a very empathetic & nice person despite the outbreak you had. Your parents are just trying to give your brother a good life but unfortunately it came at your expense... in a sense they sacrificed a piece of your childhood for him. I'm sure if they realized this they would want nothing more than to go back in time & do it differently but you only get one shot as a parent.\n\nYour reaction/outburst was a completely human one. You've held a level of resentment towards your brother because of the continual sacrifices you've had to make throughout your life & they all came out at once. Moving out, being alone & being able to live the way you want feels really good when you've grown up the way you have. Your parents & brother coming unannounced to stay for an extended period of time is so relatable to me because I could totally see my fam doing the same thing & me getting annoyed with my brothers antics. You were in your peaceful sanctuary & your family came in unannounced plus your brother doing his usual thing just pushed you to your boiling point.\n\nThe only thing that you did wrong besides let your anger consume you was saying EXACTLY how you felt completely unfiltered. I know it is much much easier said than done but you should've told your parents how you were feeling without saying it in front of your brother. I don't know the severity of your brothers special needs but for mine its like he's in a completely different world. I could scream exactly what you said in his face & he would only know that I am angry. If your brother has a level of coherence where he can actually understand what you said then I would feel so guilty as you probably are. He could hold onto that for a long time... your parents calls to you break my heart because they seem so similar to my parents.\n\nSo my advice to you would be apologize to your brother in a way that works for your relationship, apologize to your parents for the outburst but have a discussion with them about how you've felt your whole life. Tell them that its fine to come around but just to let you know in advance so you can mentally prepare (also maybe hide some stuff from your brother). But all in all no matter how you feel towards your life, childhood, brother, mom & dad they are your family & they love you. Try your hardest to overcome the negative thoughts & make the best out of what you have.\n\nDM me if you ever need someone to talk to.", "I was in a position similar to yours. I am also 27F and I have a younger autistic sister 22F who is non verbal.\n\nThe difference is my parents never had any expectations that I do anything for my sister, and always made sure we were treated equally. If my sister got a new top, I got a a little something too. If I achieved something it was my achievement, if my sister achieved something then it was her achievement. If my sister destroyed something in a meltdown then my parents replaced it and punished her. If I was naughty I was punished. If I wanted to do something and my sister couldn\u2019t do it due to her needs they looked for someone to look after her. And always made sure that both me and my sister had opportunities to enjoy the things we liked if that was separate, together or as a family unit.\n\nTHIS is how it should be done. Your parents failed you by favouring your brother. I understand they may have been trying their best with your brothers needs but in the process they forgot about YOUR needs. \n\nIf I\u2019ve done anything for my sister it\u2019s because I\u2019ve wanted to not because I was forced to. \n\nNTA OP.", "YTA. Maybe not for getting upset and yelling, but for the shitty words you said to your own brother.

Be mad at them.", "OP you don\u2019t see it, but your parents are self-centered, manipulative, and controlling.

I still get nightmares of him pooring boiling how water on my foot when i was sleeping. Mind you I WAS 8 and he was 15. Resented him and my parents everyday of my life. And the thing is he isnt even heavily autistic. He just had some developmental delay where he learns things slower than normal people. And yet he used his autism to be cruel to me everyday. As soon as i hit 16 i ran away from my home went no contact with my parents and my brother. I last heard they became homeless after covid.

She's acting like she has no agency.  She's acting like, despite being 27, she is still under parental authority.\n\nShe needs to figure out how to be an independent adult.  She needs to develop the confidence to say 'no, you won't be staying over for a month.'

Luckily they actually discussed it with me and I made my feelings clear/why and said what I would prefer as a long term plan (finding a group home and I can manage finances). By the time I was born my parents were aware that something was off, but there was really no expectation that my sibling would be incapable of living independently until after they were 18 - so it definitely wasn\u2019t part of the plan.", "I don\u2019t disagree.

I\u2019ve never seen such a collection of self centered people collected in one post before.\n\nListen OP, what you went through was tough, and it\u2019s been a constant tug of war throughout your life with your parents for their attention, and admittedly they likely failed in some respects. Parents aren\u2019t born perfect, they aren\u2019t told what to do when you\u2019re born, and add in a special needs child to the mix and it gets tough, real tough.\n\nShould your parents have stayed for a month? No. No they should not. But I think (unlike the majority of these redditors seem willing to do) you need to see a little of this from your parents perspective. They\u2019re humans too. They can be wrong, but you can emphasize where they are coming from.\n\nFirst off, they\u2019re not trying to manipulate you. I know Reddit thinks this, but they\u2019re wrong as hell. Any reply you see about how your parents might be narcissists or manipulative you need to disregard ASAP.\n\nNarcissistic people would NEVER look after a special needs kid 24/7 for 30 years. Just no. Would never happen.\n\nLet\u2019s call this as it is, your parents were given a raw deal. They love your brother, of course they do. But every second of every day that they have to look after him, they do so knowing that 1) they will be doing this until they literally can\u2019t no more, and 2) most people\nDon\u2019t understand how terribly hard it is.\n\nWhat you saw for that month with him being a tornado?\n\nThat\u2019s likely him every single day since you left to go to college.\n\nThey can\u2019t talk about it with anyone. They certainly didn\u2019t choose this life, it was just thrust upon them. There\u2019s no breaks, no chance for a breather.\n\nHell them coming to your place for a month (bringing him I might add) is as close to a \u201cfamily vacation\u201d as they\u2019re going to get. They are 100% aware of this.\n\nDads disappointed in you not because he\u2019s an asshole or he\u2019s trying to guilt you into anything. It\u2019s because he likely feels that of all the people on this earth, you would be able to understand the most to what him and mom have to put up with everyday. You think mom and dad don\u2019t want to lash out? When he\u2019s having a tantrum in a Safeway and breaking product? When they can\u2019t go on a date to a restaurant because finding just a few hours care is a huge undertaking that makes the situation not worth it?\n\nThat\u2019s why dads disappointed. You lashed out about what everyone else is thinking when they deal with your brother. It\u2019s essentially what your parents fear that everyone thinks when they meet their son. \n\nMom and dad have no choice but to suck it up and deal with his behaviour. It\u2019s not his fault, he\u2019s special needs. He literally can\u2019t control it. They\u2019ve probably been driven to the point of screaming at the top of their lungs thousands of times in the past 30 years, yet they know they can\u2019t. Their son would never understand, he\u2019s not able to.\n\nBut you? You can understand. That\u2019s why dads disappointed.\n\nAnd mom. Poor mom. She\u2019s probably absolutely terrified at what happened at your place. This was a worse case scenario (and trust me, your parents plan for worst case scenarios whenever they bring him places, even to something as mundane as bringing him to the bank. They have to, they literally have no choice).\n\nThat\u2019s why she can\u2019t stop crying when she talks to you. She\u2019s not trying to manipulate you. She\u2019s having a full on breakdown.\n\nSo yes, your parents shouldn\u2019t have attempted a month long stay like that. But have (and everyone in the comments needs to too) a little sympathy for their situation here. They didn\u2019t want this, there\u2019s no escape from it. It\u2019s essentially their life long duty and it will literally kill them one day. They\u2019re just trying their best to get by just like everyone else is. But they\u2019ve also got a life long dependant with them. One who literally breaks doors down when he melts down.\n\nParents of special needs kids are fucking saints for what they do every day and night (for the rest of their life, something people don\u2019t understand at all). I don\u2019t care any way whatsoever about half these posts calling them assholes or narcissists. Get the fuck out of here with that nonsense. \n\nThey\u2019re ordinary people just like you and me. They sometimes make mistakes, it happens. Talk to them about it. They will understand. They\u2019re both so tired. This Isn\u2019t what they envisioned life would be like at all, trust me. They have friends who are likely retired (or going to) and travelling around in the old age or entertaining new hobbies in your golden years, a freedom they\u2019ll never get to fully experience. This can make 99% of people extremely bitter. \n\nBut they\u2019re still chugging along, doing it for him. Because he can\u2019t. (I\u2019m going to assume he\u2019s likely nonverbal or close to it). That\u2019s their life now.\n\nSo phone them up, air your grievances if you\u2019d like. But don\u2019t think they planned any of this to happen. They\u2019re just as shocked as you are. They probably wanted to scream at him just as badly as you did. But they can\u2019t. \n\nJust know that they\u2019re not doing this on purpose. This is a hard life for them.", "Same - I have clearly established my boundaries with my parents and that they need to have a trust set up for my brother that I can manage on his behalf.
