My parents dotted on him and taught me to put his needs above all else. \n\nGrowing up, I never felt important. Everything I did was for my brother. I got high marks, my mom would say it\u2019s for my brother. I won a high jump competition, my brother got to keep the medal. My presents were suited for his needs. Nothing was ever mine. And I was never allowed to touch any of his stuff because that might upset him. \n\nNeedless to say, I came to harbour a sort of frustration, maybe even resentment, toward this setup. I knew it wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s fault, but I couldn\u2019t help hating him. \n\nI knew better to take it out on my brother or my parents who were really just trying their best. So I moved out as soon as I hit college. I\u2019ve felt so free ever since. I visit them twice a year, for maybe a couple days each time, and therefore don\u2019t mind the treatment as much as before. \n\nWell this past Christmas, they decided to surprise me. They came over to my place unannounced and stayed for almost a month. Either all the penned up childhood frustrations compounded or his behaviours got worse, but I snapped by the end because he rummaged around my stuff and broke something every day (some expensive, some of sentimental value). \n\nThat last time, he broke the door to my room and ruined a lot my treasured possessions, I screamed at him to get away from me and that I don\u2019t ever want to see him ever again. I think I even said something along the line of wishing he never existed. My screaming upset my brother, and my words hurt my parents. He threw a tantrum, my parents were stressed. I made a mess.\n\nMy mom has been calling everyday telling how sorry she is that I felt that way but I shouldn\u2019t have held on to such cruel sentiments. She cries for hours on the phone. My dad called a couple of times telling me how disappointed he was in me and how insensitive I had been. I feel extremely guilty but at the same time, I meant every word I said. \n\nI knew it was out of my brother\u2019s control. I knew he probably didn\u2019t mean any ill.

Oh no. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nWhile what you said was hurtful, you didn\u2019t ask for this to happen. You didn\u2019t invite them to show up on your doorstep without your permission. You didn\u2019t ask them to intrude on you in your house.\n\nTo be completely honest with you, it was inevitable that this would happen. Between your parents showing up without your knowledge to your brother completely demolishing your things, your blood slowly boiled inside until you mentally combusted.\n\nThey destroyed your boundaries, but now it\u2019s time to reinforce them. You have let this gone on far too long and have allowed them to walk all over you. The time has come for you to take back your power and to take all the power they had over you away from them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I was going to put ESH -but you were pushed to breaking point, and as I wrote out my response I changed my rating. You shouldn't have said what you did, but most people would have snapped at that point. Your parents are the biggest AHs in this scenario.\n\nThere is no justification for turning up to someone's house unannounced and then staying for a month. None. It doesn't matter what relation you are. They should never have done that, and it was this careless disregard for your home and disrespect for your autonomy that pushed you over the edge. The way they raised you and your brother was terrible, and they haven't changed since you've moved out.\n\nThey're worried about your brother's feelings, but not about yours. Saying you shouldn't feel the way you do as a result of their behaviour is negating both your emotions and their responsibility. \n\nYou clearly did the right thing in moving away and minimising contact, and they decided to force themselves upon you, which they have no right to do. \n\nYou should tell them that you will visit them in order to have family time, and they are never to visit you again. And if they do, they are financially responsible for everything their son breaks. \n\nI might go so far as to move and not give them my new address, but I know what the housing situation is like.", "NTA\n\nThey came for a surprise visit to stay for a MONTH?   Your parents are such huge assholes.   \n\nThey were bad enough to make you sacrifice your childhood to accommodate your brother's special needs, but to the invade your home for a month?\n\nThey are so far out of line I don't think the line's even visible from where they ended up.", "NTA. Not only have you been ignored for your whole life but you parents are so rude to come unannounced and stay for a month. Yes you probably shouldn\u2019t have yelled at your brother but a person can only be dismissed so many times before they snap.\nBTW Do you know what the plans are for your brother after they die? Really think you might want to check that now, as they are probably assuming that you will be his carer.", "NTA. You were basically forgotten, and your parents prioritized his special needs over your own needs. As someone who grew up in a family with a special needs sibling, you're treated as more of a problem than part of the family.", "NTA. Your parents sacrificed you on their alter to your brother. You finally manage to create something for yourself and they turn up *uninvited* and *let your brother ruin things*. And then cry because you hurt their feelings.\n\nThey have done a disservice to you *and* your brother. They may have tried their best but *it wasn't good enough*. Their best was to completely alienate their own child. Their best makes them think that you should just put up with them ruining everything in your life forever. They don't get to make you feel bad that they failed you.", "NTA.  Your parents barged into your life and obviously didn't take enough precautionary measures to protect your personal space from your brother.  Yes it may seem cruel to have blown up on him but we can all only be pushed so far.  Especially since it's clear your parents never worked to try to establish a way to get your bro to not cross boundaries.", "NTA- as someone who grew up with a special needs sibling I experienced something very similar. I also broke at about 40 years old. Family still does not understand me. They don\u2019t seem to understand that my need\u2019s really matter, and everything needed to fit their narrative\u2026.. As someone who is much older than you I will say, it is ok to look out for your best interest, speak up when you are being treated unfairly, and look out for yourself. If someone guilts you for it , and doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries then maybe they shouldn\u2019t be in your life. To be clear this isn\u2019t your brother\u2019s fault. It is the fault of the people who think that his needs and happiness is greater than yours.", "NTA. One can only be pushed so far before having a meltdown and it is sounding like this has been festering for several years.  It is no wonder that you blew up. And who stays uninvited for a freaking month? That is really pushing the envelope.   \n\nConsider this as well: You may have addressed a future issue. I have a feeling they were expecting you to become his caregiver when they pass away so your outburst has put them on notice to make other plans for him. So maybe it was a blessing in disguise.", "NTA.\nI wanna say ETA but your parents coming uninvited to a person's house, and then leaving the special needs Son to do whatever he wants without supervision. Then your dad having the audacity for calling you insensitive. Jesus christ. I reckon apologise to your brother he doesn't really understand what hes doing however your parenta do so go LC or NC with your parents for awhile.", "Man, I really don't know about this one.\n\nWeirdly, I think the biggest asshole move here is showing up at somebody's place unannounced and staying for a month. That's just crazy.", "NTA. They did this. Who surprises someone for a month visit? Mom can cry as much as she wants. Dad can be as disappointed as he wants to be. They were good parents to him at your expense.", "NTA.\n\nOkay what you said sort of was, but your parents created this whole situation and are taking none of the blame. Forget your past even, they showed up unannounced for a *month*. That is not okay ever. I\u2019d even venture to say your parents knew what they were doing because this is intruding on so many levels. Three extra people in a home you\u2019re used to being alone in is absurd. For a MONTH. I honestly would have blown up at my family, and they aren\u2019t autistic. This isn\u2019t your fault. They should never have felt comfortable intruding on your life for so long. Especially unannounced. You\u2019re not the AH because you didn\u2019t ask or condone any of this. You\u2019ve kept your distance to be peaceful and they intruded on that. It doesn\u2019t change just because they are family. You still have a right to say no and make them leave.", "NTA\n\nAnd of course you meant what you said: it's because of your Bro you've come second, gotten no autonomy growing up, no love and no compassion. As you know its really because of your parents but it makes sense that your mind would go there.\n\nYour parents sound very sheepish too. The whole thing about the award; it sounds like anytime your bro wanted something they would just give it to him to keep him for fear of having a meltdown. I've met a lot of parents who are terrified of the ASD kid.\n\nIt sounds like they figured out they are getting older and it's getting harder for them to take care of him. They needed a break, knew you'd say no, so they just showed up (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission).\n\nI'm not sure they are going to ever see how much they wronged you. so yea NC for a long time while you work through your sh!t then LC forever.", "I mean...\n\nTo have the audacity that allows someone to think showing up unexpectedly and staying for a month... A large part of me wonders if this was some secret trial run to see how you'd care for your brother after your parents death. \n\nLook. You probably said some shitty things. We all do that, especially if it's been years of repressed rage.\n\nParenting a special needs kid is hard. The parenting default is to keep the peace... And keeping the peace means keeping the loudest kid quiet and happy. However, that takes away the agency of the kid with different needs and makes an awful assumption that they have no capacity to learn boundaries or even the word NO.\n\nYour parents and sibling needed to be shown the door after a long weekend. They are only welcome for as long as you stay in their home. If they won't take responsibility for your sibling and his behavior, then they shouldn't take him to other people's homes. Your parents need to understand how their audacity and allowing your sibling to destroy everything they touch isn't ok. \n\nThey also should not be pushing their feelings on to you. The only thing that should happen is that they apologize and offer to replace what was broken. It isn't your responsibility to regulate everyone's emotions. \n\nNta", "NTA\nYou are right, it is not your brother's fault, it's your parents', because they n never taught him any boundaries.

Not nice but nta by a long shot.", "Nta. And send them a bill for everything he broke. They enabled that bad behavior they can pay for it. And set a clear boundaries.

They also set you up to resent your brother, even though they didn\u2019t deliberately do it.\n\nI would go LC while you work to sort things out. Your brother, as you know, means no harm. I think it would be very helpful to your healing to have your parents eventually sit in with the professional. Someone needs to set the record straight about what they did while you grew up.", "ESH. Your parents for enabling this behavior and honestly putting your brother at a disadvantage. He will not function well in society.

But, you are nta overall, your parents are..You lost your cool. But you need to have a real conversation with your parents. Set real boundaries. Communicate what you need from them.", "NTA But at this point I think you'd be happiest if you cut all 3 of them out of your life.", "NTA, but your parents sure are. It sounds like they\u2019ve spent most of your brother\u2019s life teaching him that he doesn\u2019t have to follow any rules or show respect to anyone else. Autism or not that\u2019s a huge recipe for disaster. What on earth were they thinking? Now they have an obviously strong enough to break down a door adult man who was never taught to take no for an answer or taught that he needs self control and how to exercise it. This is the kind of situation that ends with these poor neglected young men becoming sex offenders because they haven\u2019t been taught anything by their parents. I have a few friends who have worked in facilities that house men like your brother and those who were never given boundaries and discipline tend to struggle for the rest of their lives. \nBetween the fact that you learned to hate your brother early on and the severity of his out of control behavior I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking guardianship when the time comes. I would ask to be kept up to date on his care and wellbeing, but managing his care in any appropriate facility is going to be an absolute nightmare. If you\u2019re the guardian you will probably be fielding calls all hours of the night. As sad as it is, a state-appointed guardian is likely to be able to pass the problems with his behavior into the facility staff. When your parents pass away or become too old to care for him he is going to have an awful wake-up call because nobody else is going to tolerate this degree of behavior from him. \nI\u2019m so sorry for what your parents put you through. Your brother needed boundaries and rules and he needed to be taught respect for others. You and he were neglected in different ways, unfortunately. You thankfully have the capacity to move on, but your brother will probably always struggle because of your parents refusing to parent him. They should have engaged you in helping him understand sometimes instead of making everything you did about your brother. It sounds like they were overwhelmed and just quit trying because it was hard. Don\u2019t let them stay ever again and don\u2019t agree to take responsibility for your brother\u2019s care because you don\u2019t sound like you could handle it emotionally, which is okay especially considering how you were pitted against each other growing up.", "NTA, who shows up uninvited and stay for a whole month.

Of course you snapped. \n\nThis is one of those times where we may hate how we said it, but the reason behind what we said was real. You said those things for a reason. You didn't mean the hateful words, but the frustration and anger are valid. \n\nKeep boundaries.

Yes. But did your parents need to hear them, and take to heart how their choices have affected you all your life? Absolutely. Is it extremely childish for them to focus on how their feelings are hurt, rather than how much you have been hurting for years in order to get to this point? Massive yes.\n\nThis is going to be hard to hear: you need to reassess your opinion of your parents, and probably your relationship with them. Your parents absolutely did not \u201ctry their best\u201d if they also \u201ctaught (you) to put his needs above all else\u201d, didn\u2019t give you the space to be your own self and didn\u2019t attempt to teach your brother to respect you as your own self.

Why did they let your brother go on a rampage and do nothing to stop him? \nDo they allow this behavior at friends' houses or at the supermarket?", "You're not just NTA, you could *never* be TA.  You've been pushed out and around by your parents your whole life and you eventually snapped.  No-one can blame you for your reaction:  it was long overdue and needed to be said.\n\nAnd if your parents try to guilt-trip you over this, return the favour and tell them about how much they've favoured your brother your whole life.", "Not an expert, but since when did being autistic mean they couldn't teach him to respect your belongings in your house? But then, these are the people who showed up unannounced and invited themselves to stay for a month, so I guess they probably haven't learned that for themselves.\n\nWhile screaming at him might not have been the best way to go about it, the frustration and explosion is completely understandable, and it's your parents who are in the wrong here (your brother also, but he was apparently raised learning it's OK to do whatever to you or your stuff, so double AH to your parents). \n\nMake it clear to them that it is not OK to show up unannounced, and that if they won't make him take responsibility for any damage he might cause, THEY are responsible for it (and keeping an eye on him to prevent it if you see them again in future). You might also need to make it clear if you have no intention of being responsible for him in the future (you may be their plan for when they get too old to look after him or they pass away), if applicable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are giant assholes. Why have another kid if they're just going to treat them like that? Pisses me off.", "ESH. They can\u2019t just invite themselves over for a month. You *let* them stay. Grow a backbone.", "NTA\n\nYour parents were/are though. \n\nMy thoughts, your parents are gearing up to ask you to become your brother's caretaker. Now both are trying to manipulate you to get you to calm down after years of mistreatment caused you to explode.", "I enjoy my privacy immensely. I can barely take my mother visiting for a week alone. My entire nuclear family for a month would not be possible. And my sibling doesn't go around destroying my things.\n\nNTA. Make sure to set boundaries. Can't stay with you for more than a few days. Can't surprise you with a visit. I have a friend who sent his mother away after she showed up unannounced.", "NTA but your parents sure are. \n\nThe only thing you\u2019re wrong about here is saying that your parents tried their best when that actually didn\u2019t. If they actually did you wouldn\u2019t feel like how you do now. Your brothers needs shouldnt have been put above yours and he\u2019s not your responsibility. Yeah what you said was hurtful but everyone has said things out of anger before. No one\u2019s a saint in that regard.", "Hey op, please watch A Christmas Carol! A new korean movie.", "YTA. Christmas was a little over 2 weeks ago? How could your mom be calling everday? Your timeline makes absolutly no sense.", "NTA\n\nAnd you seriously need to get yourself some therapy. You have been trained by your parents that what you want and need is unimportant, that the only important thing in your life is your brother and what he needs and wants.\n\nWhy did you let them in for a visit? Showing up unannounced is incredibly disrespectful.\n\nWhy did you let them stay in your home instead of get a hotel? You didn't agree to plan for their visit, so you're not responsible for accommodating them.\n\nWhy did you let them stay for a month? That's the kind of visit that people used to do when they were landed gentry in the Regency era. And it was because getting anywhere took a freaking long time, when the only way to travel was by horse and carriage.  \n\nAfter all this, you're still accommodating them. You are not responsible for your mothers emotions. If you're talking to her on the phone (assuming you want to) and she starts crying and screaming, say \"I can see you're upset right now. I'll give you some time to get in control of your emotions. Let's talk in a few days.\" And you hang up. \n\nIf you pay for your own phone bill, then your phone exists for your convenience. No one else gets to decide that you stay on the phone for an hour and listen to them rage or sob at you.\n\nYou deserve to have control over your life and your time and your home and your phone. But your actions say that you do not believe that. And that is why you need to get into therapy and unpack your entire childhood.", "I\u2019m also trying to figure out why they would show up unannounced for a month with someone who apparently regularly breaks things and according to the parents isn\u2019t at fault for it/can\u2019t control it. They gave OP no time to prepare or hide away valuable and then we\u2019re surprised when they got pissed their stuff was being destroyed.", "You absolutely KNOW this was a test run. Parents expect OP to take brother on when they get too old or pass away. They came for a MONTH to test drive OP as brother's caretaker. Mother's tears are grieving this transfer of custodianship, because the test drive didn't go very well. Mother is hoping to guilt OP into it. OP, draw your boundaries clearly and feel free to categorically refuse any future caretaking responsibilities before it comes up. Your parents need to make other plans, and they should start now.", "I agree  that's  not a visit. Next time if you keep  in contact,  tell them to stay at an airbnb  or hotel. They know darn well that your brother  doesn't  have boundaries and  should have planned accordingly.  This is YOUR HOME, NOT THEIRS. \nNta", "NTA, how much do you want to bet this was a test run for OP taking over his care?", "I\u2019ve been told repeatedly that it\u2019s cruel to think so - especially when people with special needs like her brother have equally right for life like the OP has - but whenever I see these stories, I always think that we\u2019ve seemed to gone too much into the other side. In developed world, we used to place people with special needs into institutions because both of public shame, but also because it was deemed that regular people weren\u2019t equipped to deal well enough with people with special needs. \n\nThose places were often horrible and full of mistreatment and expensive which is why they were closed up and families got the state assistance programs etc to assist them with taking care of their own relatives and kids with special needs. Over time, support for such programs has been cut and more and more parents with special needs kids will have had to dedicate majority of their time and energy for caring them, making them unable to care for their other kids, which we\u2019re now seeing the results of. \n\nI sometimes feel that the idea of day-centres or institutional care for special needs people weren\u2019t that bad in the ideals, just in execution. Especially as you wouldn\u2019t often even know that your kid may be special needs until they\u2019re like 2-4 years old so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s something you can even always know when you\u2019re pregnant.", ">Your family showed up to your residence unannounced and were up your ass for a month? Oh no. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nEven without the history between OP and her brother, even if he didn't regularly destroy her possessions: you don't just show up and move in with someone for a month. That's in no way okay.", "The idea of one of my parents showing up and staying for a month is making my breath come short.", "Agree and op you should  tell them to make arrangements that doesn't include  you as a carer  mostly  if you agree as a supervisor of his care", "Nope  they are financially responsible  for where they stay during the visit.  No need to let  the brother  destroy op s loved belongings if it can be easily avoided  by staying somewhere else. Also some stuff is priceless  for someone and irreplaceable.  \n\nNta", "The minute they turned up to stay for a month, these parents became the AHs in the story. Also, they can\u2019t be that stupid that they don\u2019t see the op\u2019s resentments building from childhood. Did they think their son would be allowed to continue to wreck her life in her own home like he did during their childhood years? They should have left him behind or supervised him properly.", "to me, it's teaching a child that they can do whatever just because they're autistic. That's one smooth way to see bars.", "Hopefully, she scared them off for trying this!", "Absolutely, this was about ensuring that the son has someone to take care of him in life, when the parents have passed.  The sheer arrogance of the parents is staggering.", "I\u00b4 am not sure if going NC is the best solution here. It sounds a little bit too harsh for me. While I understand that the frustration during childhood was big and with everything that happened it kind of exploded, I still think that with communication and clear boundaries everything can be settled back . OP already mentioned that since them moving out the frustration died down. If boundaries are set in place and said boundaries are then broken, then they can think about consequences.", "Going no contact is not the perfect solution for every conflict. Usually there are steps in between, e.g. family counselling.", "Because \"that's the way he is\" and they want her to take over his care, I'm guessing.", "Maybe they wanted to \"test the waters\"? See how much can they guilt trip OP to take care of her brother during a month and then announce he will stay with her from now on? \nI would be careful with that OP, no idea how tenancy works where OP lives but letting them stay so long wasn't a good idea, not only for OP mental health. \n\nOP NTA.", "OP also needs to be aware that when her parents do pass, they will likely put her in their will as her brothers carer and plan accordingly for that outcome too. A lot of people have done this without the future \"carers\" prior consent and refuse to make alternative plans to make them think they have no choice.", "Can you imagine the disaster the brother would cause staying in an Airbnb", "The thing is, in the US there were supposed to be community clinics and day centers to take the place of the horror-show institutions. The idea was that people could live independently in little apartments, or with their families, and still receive guidance and help. That never happened, because men in power didn't want to pay for it. So now families are on their own.", "I agree that\u2019s a likely scenario. It\u2019s just extremely sad that they let it get to this point.", "That's very cynical. Unfortunately, also very likely.", "OP is 27. I seriously doubt she is still in college after 9 years.", "Have you ever tried to teach someone with autism to do anything that does not fit into their comfort zone before? You'd have better luck nailing water to a tree, it's damn near impossible the further along the spectrum you go. They do not do so willingly, their minds are just not wired the same way and change can sometimes even be physically painful to them.\n\nNot everyone in this world is out to get you or take advantage of you. Without knowing what kind of people OPs parents really are on their own without the brother in the mix, it is unfair to paint them with that brush as we only have one viewpoint to go on. \n\nAgain, not being able to hold onto rewards is not as big a point as you might think. It could simply be the brother wanting to hold onto something shiny, or the parents wanting to make him feel included. Yes, it sucks not being able to have the limelight to yourself for even a second, no matter how great your achievement is, but sometimes its just easier for the parents to include the brother rather than risk the inevitable uncontrollable outburst because from experience again...having to work long hours and then still have to deal with a crying and screaming adult over an admittedly stupid situation to begin with and whom behaves like a child is not fun for anyone. It's simply the lesser of two evils.", "They literally made OP's life about the brother. They let him keep OP's medals, steal his belongings, and break them. What kind of communication is going to fix that?", "But while you heal yourself and find out how you can handle them (therapy) it is often the best way or they just destroy your effort again and again.", "And because nothing of hers is important. And she isn't important.", "I don't think you can force someone into being a caretaker by just adding it into a will.", "Not op s problem  but her parents  in that case and they will pay for it", "And families are often not the best caretakers too", "I hope op ie realizes that next time mommy tries to cry on the phone for hours she should just say yeah I got to go click. Emotional manipulation is all that mess is.", "I\u2019m 27 and doing my PhD so still at uni lmao", "ooh. my brain completely skipped over the age. although i have no idea how long any sorts of college courses last. for all i know there might be ones that take a decade!", "You really think these two are caring for their 30 yo at home, and still funding the life if their college educated 27 yo who they see for maybe 10 days every year? It's not *impossible*, but it's seriously unlikely.", "Also, they imposed themselves on her for a whole freaking month. Even my boundary-breaking mentally ill mom wouldn\u2019t do that.", "I agree and I think it is horrible that that happened but, as other useres were saying,  telling the parents, that they are no longer welcome to visit and that if they want to meet they should either wait for OP to visit or get an airbnb or a Hotel.", "It can be a solution, yes. But there should be steps in between. I am low contact with my mother, I have tried many steps to work through it and decided with my therapist after many sessions that this would be the best solution. \n\nReddit tends to jump towards extreme solutions after a few paragraphs of story. No contact may be right for OP but we really shouldn't push for it, that should be up to them and their support network.", "Bet they now regret that", "Good for you! Congratulations!", "But that\u2019s not the norm", "What was it there chief? Did you forget a word at the end or are you actually saying it isn't a joke regardless of my intention?\n\nHow does that even work? I'm pretty sure the question of whether it's a joke is answered by my subjective intent. I mean, something unintentionally funny might be loosely described as a joke even if it's not intended to be a joke. But how can something that's intended to be a joke not be a joke?\n\nWhen you think about it, this was a pretty dumb thing you said here.", "Did you think this was an own? Lol"]}
