My parents dotted on him and taught me to put his needs above all else. \n\nGrowing up, I never felt important. Everything I did was for my brother. I got high marks, my mom would say it\u2019s for my brother. I won a high jump competition, my brother got to keep the medal. My presents were suited for his needs. Nothing was ever mine. And I was never allowed to touch any of his stuff because that might upset him. \n\nNeedless to say, I came to harbour a sort of frustration, maybe even resentment, toward this setup. I knew it wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s fault, but I couldn\u2019t help hating him. \n\nI knew better to take it out on my brother or my parents who were really just trying their best. So I moved out as soon as I hit college. I\u2019ve felt so free ever since. I visit them twice a year, for maybe a couple days each time, and therefore don\u2019t mind the treatment as much as before. \n\nWell this past Christmas, they decided to surprise me. They came over to my place unannounced and stayed for almost a month. Either all the penned up childhood frustrations compounded or his behaviours got worse, but I snapped by the end because he rummaged around my stuff and broke something every day (some expensive, some of sentimental value). \n\nThat last time, he broke the door to my room and ruined a lot my treasured possessions, I screamed at him to get away from me and that I don\u2019t ever want to see him ever again. I think I even said something along the line of wishing he never existed. My screaming upset my brother, and my words hurt my parents. He threw a tantrum, my parents were stressed. I made a mess.\n\nMy mom has been calling everyday telling how sorry she is that I felt that way but I shouldn\u2019t have held on to such cruel sentiments. She cries for hours on the phone. My dad called a couple of times telling me how disappointed he was in me and how insensitive I had been. I feel extremely guilty but at the same time, I meant every word I said. \n\nI knew it was out of my brother\u2019s control. I knew he probably didn\u2019t mean any ill.

Oh no. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nWhile what you said was hurtful, you didn\u2019t ask for this to happen. You didn\u2019t invite them to show up on your doorstep without your permission. You didn\u2019t ask them to intrude on you in your house.\n\nTo be completely honest with you, it was inevitable that this would happen. Between your parents showing up without your knowledge to your brother completely demolishing your things, your blood slowly boiled inside until you mentally combusted.\n\nThey destroyed your boundaries, but now it\u2019s time to reinforce them. You have let this gone on far too long and have allowed them to walk all over you. The time has come for you to take back your power and to take all the power they had over you away from them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I was going to put ESH -but you were pushed to breaking point, and as I wrote out my response I changed my rating. You shouldn't have said what you did, but most people would have snapped at that point. Your parents are the biggest AHs in this scenario.\n\nThere is no justification for turning up to someone's house unannounced and then staying for a month. None. It doesn't matter what relation you are. They should never have done that, and it was this careless disregard for your home and disrespect for your autonomy that pushed you over the edge. The way they raised you and your brother was terrible, and they haven't changed since you've moved out.\n\nThey're worried about your brother's feelings, but not about yours. Saying you shouldn't feel the way you do as a result of their behaviour is negating both your emotions and their responsibility. \n\nYou clearly did the right thing in moving away and minimising contact, and they decided to force themselves upon you, which they have no right to do. \n\nYou should tell them that you will visit them in order to have family time, and they are never to visit you again. And if they do, they are financially responsible for everything their son breaks. \n\nI might go so far as to move and not give them my new address, but I know what the housing situation is like.", "NTA\n\nThey came for a surprise visit to stay for a MONTH?   Your parents are such huge assholes.   \n\nThey were bad enough to make you sacrifice your childhood to accommodate your brother's special needs, but to the invade your home for a month?\n\nThey are so far out of line I don't think the line's even visible from where they ended up.", "NTA. Not only have you been ignored for your whole life but you parents are so rude to come unannounced and stay for a month. Yes you probably shouldn\u2019t have yelled at your brother but a person can only be dismissed so many times before they snap.\nBTW Do you know what the plans are for your brother after they die? Really think you might want to check that now, as they are probably assuming that you will be his carer.", "NTA. You were basically forgotten, and your parents prioritized his special needs over your own needs. As someone who grew up in a family with a special needs sibling, you're treated as more of a problem than part of the family.", "NTA. Your parents sacrificed you on their alter to your brother. You finally manage to create something for yourself and they turn up *uninvited* and *let your brother ruin things*. And then cry because you hurt their feelings.\n\nThey have done a disservice to you *and* your brother. They may have tried their best but *it wasn't good enough*. Their best was to completely alienate their own child. Their best makes them think that you should just put up with them ruining everything in your life forever. They don't get to make you feel bad that they failed you.", "NTA.  Your parents barged into your life and obviously didn't take enough precautionary measures to protect your personal space from your brother.  Yes it may seem cruel to have blown up on him but we can all only be pushed so far.  Especially since it's clear your parents never worked to try to establish a way to get your bro to not cross boundaries.", "NTA- as someone who grew up with a special needs sibling I experienced something very similar. I also broke at about 40 years old. Family still does not understand me. They don\u2019t seem to understand that my need\u2019s really matter, and everything needed to fit their narrative\u2026.. As someone who is much older than you I will say, it is ok to look out for your best interest, speak up when you are being treated unfairly, and look out for yourself. If someone guilts you for it , and doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries then maybe they shouldn\u2019t be in your life. To be clear this isn\u2019t your brother\u2019s fault. It is the fault of the people who think that his needs and happiness is greater than yours.", "NTA. One can only be pushed so far before having a meltdown and it is sounding like this has been festering for several years.  It is no wonder that you blew up. And who stays uninvited for a freaking month? That is really pushing the envelope.   \n\nConsider this as well: You may have addressed a future issue. I have a feeling they were expecting you to become his caregiver when they pass away so your outburst has put them on notice to make other plans for him. So maybe it was a blessing in disguise.", "NTA.\nI wanna say ETA but your parents coming uninvited to a person's house, and then leaving the special needs Son to do whatever he wants without supervision. Then your dad having the audacity for calling you insensitive. Jesus christ. I reckon apologise to your brother he doesn't really understand what hes doing however your parenta do so go LC or NC with your parents for awhile.", "Man, I really don't know about this one.\n\nWeirdly, I think the biggest asshole move here is showing up at somebody's place unannounced and staying for a month. That's just crazy.", "NTA. They did this. Who surprises someone for a month visit? Mom can cry as much as she wants. Dad can be as disappointed as he wants to be. They were good parents to him at your expense.", "NTA.\n\nOkay what you said sort of was, but your parents created this whole situation and are taking none of the blame. Forget your past even, they showed up unannounced for a *month*. That is not okay ever. I\u2019d even venture to say your parents knew what they were doing because this is intruding on so many levels. Three extra people in a home you\u2019re used to being alone in is absurd. For a MONTH. I honestly would have blown up at my family, and they aren\u2019t autistic. This isn\u2019t your fault. They should never have felt comfortable intruding on your life for so long. Especially unannounced. You\u2019re not the AH because you didn\u2019t ask or condone any of this. You\u2019ve kept your distance to be peaceful and they intruded on that. It doesn\u2019t change just because they are family. You still have a right to say no and make them leave.", "NTA\n\nAnd of course you meant what you said: it's because of your Bro you've come second, gotten no autonomy growing up, no love and no compassion. As you know its really because of your parents but it makes sense that your mind would go there.\n\nYour parents sound very sheepish too. The whole thing about the award; it sounds like anytime your bro wanted something they would just give it to him to keep him for fear of having a meltdown. I've met a lot of parents who are terrified of the ASD kid.\n\nIt sounds like they figured out they are getting older and it's getting harder for them to take care of him. They needed a break, knew you'd say no, so they just showed up (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission).\n\nI'm not sure they are going to ever see how much they wronged you. so yea NC for a long time while you work through your sh!t then LC forever.", "I mean...\n\nTo have the audacity that allows someone to think showing up unexpectedly and staying for a month... A large part of me wonders if this was some secret trial run to see how you'd care for your brother after your parents death. \n\nLook. You probably said some shitty things. We all do that, especially if it's been years of repressed rage.\n\nParenting a special needs kid is hard. The parenting default is to keep the peace... And keeping the peace means keeping the loudest kid quiet and happy. However, that takes away the agency of the kid with different needs and makes an awful assumption that they have no capacity to learn boundaries or even the word NO.\n\nYour parents and sibling needed to be shown the door after a long weekend. They are only welcome for as long as you stay in their home. If they won't take responsibility for your sibling and his behavior, then they shouldn't take him to other people's homes. Your parents need to understand how their audacity and allowing your sibling to destroy everything they touch isn't ok. \n\nThey also should not be pushing their feelings on to you. The only thing that should happen is that they apologize and offer to replace what was broken. It isn't your responsibility to regulate everyone's emotions. \n\nNta", "NTA\nYou are right, it is not your brother's fault, it's your parents', because they n never taught him any boundaries.

Not nice but nta by a long shot.", "Nta. And send them a bill for everything he broke. They enabled that bad behavior they can pay for it. And set a clear boundaries.

Your parents for enabling this behavior and honestly putting your brother at a disadvantage. He will not function well in society.

But, you are nta overall, your parents are..You lost your cool. But you need to have a real conversation with your parents. Set real boundaries. Communicate what you need from them.", "NTA But at this point I think you'd be happiest if you cut all 3 of them out of your life.", "NTA, but your parents sure are. It sounds like they\u2019ve spent most of your brother\u2019s life teaching him that he doesn\u2019t have to follow any rules or show respect to anyone else. Autism or not that\u2019s a huge recipe for disaster. What on earth were they thinking? Now they have an obviously strong enough to break down a door adult man who was never taught to take no for an answer or taught that he needs self control and how to exercise it. This is the kind of situation that ends with these poor neglected young men becoming sex offenders because they haven\u2019t been taught anything by their parents. I have a few friends who have worked in facilities that house men like your brother and those who were never given boundaries and discipline tend to struggle for the rest of their lives. \nBetween the fact that you learned to hate your brother early on and the severity of his out of control behavior I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking guardianship when the time comes. I would ask to be kept up to date on his care and wellbeing, but managing his care in any appropriate facility is going to be an absolute nightmare. If you\u2019re the guardian you will probably be fielding calls all hours of the night. As sad as it is, a state-appointed guardian is likely to be able to pass the problems with his behavior into the facility staff. When your parents pass away or become too old to care for him he is going to have an awful wake-up call because nobody else is going to tolerate this degree of behavior from him. \nI\u2019m so sorry for what your parents put you through. Your brother needed boundaries and rules and he needed to be taught respect for others. You and he were neglected in different ways, unfortunately. You thankfully have the capacity to move on, but your brother will probably always struggle because of your parents refusing to parent him. They should have engaged you in helping him understand sometimes instead of making everything you did about your brother. It sounds like they were overwhelmed and just quit trying because it was hard. Don\u2019t let them stay ever again and don\u2019t agree to take responsibility for your brother\u2019s care because you don\u2019t sound like you could handle it emotionally, which is okay especially considering how you were pitted against each other growing up.", "NTA, who shows up uninvited and stay for a whole month.

Of course you snapped. \n\nThis is one of those times where we may hate how we said it, but the reason behind what we said was real. You said those things for a reason. You didn't mean the hateful words, but the frustration and anger are valid. \n\nKeep boundaries.

And if everything belongs to the brother, he can break it if he wants to.\n\nIt was a dress rehearsal for foisting the brother onto OP, either at the end of the visit or when the parents decide to let go.", "\u201cDad, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed in me. Im disappointed in how you\u2019ve sacrificed my entire childhood and refused to set boundaries to keep me safe. Im disappointed in your behavior, your attitude, and mom\u2019s attempts to emotionally manipulate me.\u201d", "Op is daughter", "Autism is a spectrum, some autistic people can understand, some can't. That being said, most autistic people are able to understand \"no\" or a non-verbal alternative (sign, image) and keep their hands off other people's stuff- with lots of time and patience, perseverance and things to occupy them that they can touch and play with. Doesn't work for everyone, but it sounds like the parents weren't teaching their son boundaries and tried to groom OP to accept their boundaries being violated and become his carer.\n\nI work with disabled kids and many of them really weren't taught boundaries or life skills they can learn - because their parents can't look to their same age peers for guidance, they don't know what to teach when. And that's fine, parents are human too- it's when you ask their therapist, or their teacher, or anyone else that can help you teach boundaries, and don't stick your head in the sand and ignore it.", "Ummm\u2026. What exactly do you think autism is?  He\u2019s not an idiot but you clearly are.", "Exactly.\n\nThey were hoping OP would just slide right into that caretaker role. Enough to be like, \"Oh, your brother loves it here, and you've been such a good nurse! Let me go get his luggage!\"", "It says autistic in the title. He might have other disabilities than just autism though.", "If this was supposed to be a joke, it wasn't.", "So someone debating you automatically means your opinion isn't allowed. Eh?\n\nThere is a difference. And both can also exist simultaneously. Like.....in the post.\n\nIt does not confirm anything of the sort. You're very angry. Are you on?"]}
