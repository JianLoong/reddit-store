It\u2019s was 3 heavy boxes is anyone was wondering)\nFast forward 5 months and my husband and I got our very first apartment together and had absolutely no furniture. By this time we had put the boxes in my sisters storage unit because we had no use for them at her house.\nWe also had things in the storage unit so when we were moving we went to take the stuff and remembered the stools so we took them. I figured they\u2019ve been in here for 5 months and it\u2019s our very first ever apartment so my sister would be ok with us taking them. \nFast forward again to us being in our apartment for 2 months and we finally invited my sister over.

You almost ensured the dispute had been initiated. \n\nFrom the info presented, ESH. You all deserve each other.", "The person told YOU to keep them so they were yours. But then you said she could get them when she wanted and they became her stools.", "Esh, you both are fighting over something that didn't belong to any of you in the first place. I guess you both are made for each other.", "Why don\u2019t you just tell her that she didn\u2019t buy them, and they aren\u2019t hers?", "ESH, y'all are fighting for something that isn't either of yours. Not to mention, you guys need to communicate better. It wouldn't have hurt to ask her beforehand if she wanted the stools and whether you could take it.\n\nAlso just to put things into perspective, when you mention that you tracked down the owner and that you guys had stored it, was your sister a part of all this? Because if she wasn't, it makes sense for you guys to keep it as she showed no interest in it beforehand and you guys took sole responsibility for it. But on the other hand, if she was part of it , then it's not exactly fair for you guys to just take it and leave. Maybe she wanted to store it until she started the Airbnb and then use it. Also you did tell her that she can come get the stool once she had the property ready so I don't know why you're mad at her for wanting them now.", "Why did you assume they were yours? Did you pay rent while you lived with your sister and kept it in her storage?", "ESH\n\nThey were delivered to HER house. Had you not been there, you would never have even known about them. The person who bought them said to keep them. That would mean the owner of the property they were delivered to, not someone who just happened to be staying in the home briefly.\n\nHaving said that, you're basically using stolen goods. They technically belong to the company that made them.  You're breaking the law by having them in your home. Food for thought before you get into a pissing match over something so ridiculous. \n\nAs for your sister, when she picks up the stools, she will be trafficking in stolen goods, just like you are. Keep in mind, before you decide to be petty and report her to the police after she gets the stools, you would still be complicit and she has photos of the stools in your home, where you used them for a year and a quarter.", "ESH\n\nYou stole these stools. None of you are the rightful owners. You should have contacted the delivery company or the seller and only if they said you can keep it they would have been yours. \n\nSo you are just a bunch of thieves fighting about stolen goods asking on reddit who is in the right, lol.", "Depending on if she knew about the stools but it\u2019s been sooooo long I think she just wanted them if you did all the work and spoke to people and they said keep it and you guys are using them she can piss off\u2026but then you said she could take them\u2026.idk why I\u2019d have said no. It\u2019s been over a year, if she has rentals she can get stools sheeesh.

Skip the passive-aggressive stuff. You should have had an open discussion about it when you moved out. \n\nOp, if you want to keep them, tell her outright.", "Yes but it was delivered to the wrong house. She never ordered them it was a mistake delivery", "Who cares. They weren't meant for HER house anyways.", "Agreed tbh this is all extremely immature for a 33 and 43yo. A two minute conversation a year and a half ago would have solved this.", "Dude seriously. Were you even paying rent when she got the delivery to her house by mistake?", "Yupp! Paying rent and 2 utilities (electric and internet)", "And on the storage unit where she was storing the chairs? Idk honestly kinda leaning y t a because it sounds like your sister was doing you a favor letting you stay there and the stools were in her storage locker \u2026 unless you were paying for that at well. I can be swayed", "Just because someone does you a favor does not mean they can dictate repayment whenever and however they want. If you're doing a favor for someone with the goal of recouping on it, you're not really doing them a favor. You're putting them in debt without their knowledge or consent.", "\ud83d\udc4c", "Well if you were paying storage rental they are your chairs. NTA"]}
