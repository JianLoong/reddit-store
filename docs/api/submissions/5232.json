Great guy, really good at his job but permanently stressed.  He recruited me and we\u2019ve worked well together since. Within our dept is also \u201cMaria\u201d; she and I are the most senior below Barry.  We\u2019re both in our mid 30s. I have a bigger team though and objectively I am more qualified and experienced than her.\n\nMaria is having \u2018secret\u2019 relationship with \u201cSteve\u201d, director of another division, who is married. It has been going on for a while and they are surprisingly indiscreet. It\u2019s the open secret of the company but most people, including myself, have better things to worry about.  Everyone assumes everyone else (apart from Steve\u2019s wife) knows.  It has been difficult when he has brought her to company events. Everyone has felt awkward, nobody has said anything, nobody has really wanted to sit with them.\n\nRecently Barry had a heart attack.  It was awful and he\u2019s had to have a heart bypass, which he\u2019s now recovering from.  Luckily it seems he\u2019s going to be ok. Whilst all this was happening, Maria were both asked to step up which we did.\n\nBarry has now decided to take early retirement and Maria and I are now in the running for his job. They have decided not to look externally. There\u2019s a fairly extensive selection process, involving presentations and multiple interviews. Fine, happy with this.  Until I heard that Steve was one of the interviewers. I was told by \u201cTony\u201d, Steve and Barry\u2019s boss and I looked a bit stunned. Tony asked what was wrong and I realised he mustn\u2019t have known (possible as he is a bit distant from everyone and relies heavily on Barry, Steve and others to keep him up to date).  I have a terrible poker face though and he knew something was wrong. I mumbled something about them being \u2018close friends\u2019 and then he got it. Tony\u2019s also a bit old fashioned so will likely not approve. \n\nTony\u2019s outright asked Steve and he\u2019s admitted it and is now removed from the process. Maria clearly knows about my involvement and is furious with me. She thinks I\u2019ve done it deliberately to make her look bad to Tony, giving me an unfair advantage and says that Steve was one of many and would have been impartial and professional and what could he have said when asked. She also said if I was so sure of myself I could have stood on my record. I said I was happy to do that even without my GF being on the panel, unlike her. \n\nI do feel bad to an extent because she\u2019s good at her job and I don\u2019t think she should be disadvantaged because of Tony disapproving of her personal life. Not that I know this will happen. However, this could have been avoided if Steve had come up with an excuse and I think I could have got it anyway. \n\nShe may still get it\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1671569405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqz9nj/aita_for_telling_the_boss_about_my_interview/", "score": 1111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

THAT IS WHY HE WAS REMOVED FROM THE POSITION WHEN THE BOSS FOUND OUT.  He was not punished for the affair, reprimanded, anything.  He was simply removed from the process of interviewing his girlfriend, because it would be an ethical violation.  She can say he would have been impartial all she wants.

It sucked because I wanted to be a part of the process but it totally removed any doubts about fairness and transparency so whatever. An affair partner?? Absolutely not, that's highly inappropriate and would call into question her qualifications (which is unfair if she's a good employee who would have gotten the promotion on her own merits)", "???   No one is being punished.  No one \u201cfucked around and found out.\u201d  All that\u2019s happened is someone in an intimate relationship with a job candidate was removed from the candidate interview board.  It\u2019s standard procedure.  NTA.\n\n\nEdit.

That has everything to do with the job.", "Exactly! OP minded their buisness until it became an ethical problem NTA", "Yes, me too .", "He totally could\u2019ve stepped down without saying anything about the extramarital affair!

This isn't about the morality of the affair, but about a direct conflict of interest. No court would allow including the boyfriend of one of the parties in the jury - Steve should have recused himself (which he could have done even without disclosing the reason). OP is not only NTA, but absolutely within their rights to point out the bias in the process.", "Agreed.\n\nPlus it would be a gross conflict of interest for Steve to be on the panel. They would never permit a boyfriend to be on a girlfriend's (or vice versa) or a wife to be on a husband's interview panel because of the very clear conflict of interest. This is absolutely no different. Take out the affair - they are seeing each other romantically, which should 100% exclude Steve from the process. If it came to light after the fact that they were seeing each other and Maria got the job, there would in all likelihood be HR blowback.", "Yes. He should have declared it, it's such a glaring conflict of interest.", "Considering that Steve is *Married* and its *not* to Maria, isn't that a conflict of *ETHICS*??

Thank you. If you (general) must engage in this sort of hurtful lie, at least have the decency to be discreet enough that I can be honest when I say I had no idea.

He brought it up because he was at a personal DISADVANTAGE from not bringing it up.\n\nMaria's boyfriend was on the advisory panel to select the best applicant.  He clearly has personal bias, and could very easily have lobbied hard for his GIRLFRIEND to get the job.  Which is why if management had known Steve was in a personal relationship with Maria, he never would have been on the advisory committee.  And also is why when management found out, he was immediately removed.\n\nMaria can claim all she wants that Steve would never have been biased.  The reality is, it was a huge conflict of interest and an ethics violation.
