Great guy, really good at his job but permanently stressed.  He recruited me and we\u2019ve worked well together since. Within our dept is also \u201cMaria\u201d; she and I are the most senior below Barry.  We\u2019re both in our mid 30s. I have a bigger team though and objectively I am more qualified and experienced than her.\n\nMaria is having \u2018secret\u2019 relationship with \u201cSteve\u201d, director of another division, who is married. It has been going on for a while and they are surprisingly indiscreet. It\u2019s the open secret of the company but most people, including myself, have better things to worry about.  Everyone assumes everyone else (apart from Steve\u2019s wife) knows.  It has been difficult when he has brought her to company events. Everyone has felt awkward, nobody has said anything, nobody has really wanted to sit with them.\n\nRecently Barry had a heart attack.  It was awful and he\u2019s had to have a heart bypass, which he\u2019s now recovering from.  Luckily it seems he\u2019s going to be ok. Whilst all this was happening, Maria were both asked to step up which we did.\n\nBarry has now decided to take early retirement and Maria and I are now in the running for his job. They have decided not to look externally. There\u2019s a fairly extensive selection process, involving presentations and multiple interviews. Fine, happy with this.  Until I heard that Steve was one of the interviewers. I was told by \u201cTony\u201d, Steve and Barry\u2019s boss and I looked a bit stunned. Tony asked what was wrong and I realised he mustn\u2019t have known (possible as he is a bit distant from everyone and relies heavily on Barry, Steve and others to keep him up to date).  I have a terrible poker face though and he knew something was wrong. I mumbled something about them being \u2018close friends\u2019 and then he got it. Tony\u2019s also a bit old fashioned so will likely not approve. \n\nTony\u2019s outright asked Steve and he\u2019s admitted it and is now removed from the process. Maria clearly knows about my involvement and is furious with me. She thinks I\u2019ve done it deliberately to make her look bad to Tony, giving me an unfair advantage and says that Steve was one of many and would have been impartial and professional and what could he have said when asked. She also said if I was so sure of myself I could have stood on my record. I said I was happy to do that even without my GF being on the panel, unlike her. \n\nI do feel bad to an extent because she\u2019s good at her job and I don\u2019t think she should be disadvantaged because of Tony disapproving of her personal life. Not that I know this will happen. However, this could have been avoided if Steve had come up with an excuse and I think I could have got it anyway. \n\nShe may still get it\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1671569405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqz9nj/aita_for_telling_the_boss_about_my_interview/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re NTA.", "They are in different departments.  I had assumed Tony knew and he clearly didn\u2019t.  Maybe HR didn\u2019t.  They do now!", "Honestly, I don\u2019t know. There probably is between line mangers/ direct report or people in the same department which they actually weren\u2019t. Im now wondering whether HR didn\u2019t know either, given Tony didn\u2019t. Everyone in the operations departments knew, it\u2019s easy to assume everyone knew if we all did.", "Why would OP?", "Sorry?", "Agree normally, but he\u2019s still not back at work and I think he\u2019s probably got more to worry about at the moment.", "Fair enough.  This is what happened but I did say in another comment that had I found out say by email when I was on my own, I would still have said something in some way. I wouldn\u2019t have just left it. I\u2019m a man by the way, I also forgot to put that in the post.", "Agree, just didn\u2019t want to misrepresent.", "OP, I hope you get the job, but either way, make sure you document and date every interaction you have with Maria and Tony, especially ones that makes you uncomfortable. I would prefer if you report their affair to HR for them to document so if anything happens, you are legally protected. This is all under the assumption that your HR and company is not terrible and don't hide abuses of power.", "Makes sense, I know our work won't put people that are in a relationship in the same department if one is a supervisor or manager, but may be worth finding out what the actual policies and rules are around things like that", "OK. It was a tiny nitpick anyway. Thanks for clarifying your gender.  i\u2019ll fix.", "They are not terrible. I agree re documenting stuff but I\u2019m not particularly worried", "My GF at one point worked for one of our suppliers.  I was paranoid about conflict of interests if they ever did any work for us.  My boss was bored of me telling him about her and I never hired them directly, always got someone else to review it. So I was totally on it, as regards that bit. This - never really thought about until now.  Need to if I do get this job!!"]}
