The oldest one has been there for me for ages and always cuddled up to me if i was sad. I was and still am very attached to him.\n\nNow a few days ago we sadly had to say goodbye to the oldest and all 3 of us were devistated, the death happened at the vet after he got a blood clot in his heart. Now 5 days have passed and it was my first day working again, since the death took a toll on me. I am still very upset and mentioning him still makes me cry as im still grieving. \nMy dad took it a bit better and while SM seemed just as sad as i was the day it happened it almost feels like it isn't affecting her anymore. I know different people grieve in other ways but it just rubbed me the wrong way.\nOn my way home today she texted me a picture of another kitten who was around 16 weeks and needed a new home. I told her the kitten was cute but asked if it wasnt too fast for a new cat. She replied that our other cat looked lonely and upset and that he needs a new buddy. I just replied with an \"okay\" and waited for the conversation to continue at home.\n\nWhen i got home not 10 minutes later she told me we could go and meet the new kitten tomorrow, i just didn't know what to respond. To me it all felt way too quick for a new kitten in the house. When I didn't respond she asked me if I dont want to go look and i answered honestly; i think its too fast for a new kitten and not a good idea. She replied that she would cancel the appointment and just walked away. I started to feel bad and asked if she was mad at me and SM only said she was dissapointed. After that she did not really seem wanting to talk to me and now i feel bad but i dont think i did anything wrong?

Everyone does grieve in their own way, including cats. It sounds like everyone is well-intentioned here and trying to be supportive of everyone\u2019s feelings. \n\nAs a fellow 43f, I would have interpreted your \u201cokay\u201d text to mean \u201cyes, that\u2019s an idea I agree with.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that SM is feeling like a kitten would help her and the remaining cat, and she thought she got agreement from you, too, and was disappointed when from her perspective you changed your mind.", "So cats do get lonely, especially ones raised with \"siblings\" and sometimes you have to suck up your own grief because your pet needs you. I'm am voting NAH, because I don't think either of you are being malicious or acting cruel. \n\n\nTake care OP", "NAH. You're allowed to want more time to grieve, and she's allowed to be disappointed about not getting a new kitten right away. You need to be okay with her disappointment -- her feelings are her own to manage, not yours, but that also means she's entitled to have them whether or not you'd prefer that she not. \n\nPeople grieve in different ways. She has accepted that there will be no new kitten just yet. Let that be enough for you and don't ask that she feel good about it too.", "NAH. Some people get a new pet quickly because it helps them through the grieving process. Others can't imagine getting a new pet anytime soon after a loss. You two just have two grieving styles. It sounds like your SM is also trying to help out your other cat. You're not an AH but neither is she.", "NAH. Like everyone has said, everyone grieves in their own way.", "NAH. She is probably grieving in her own way and she probably thought a new kitten to distract you would help you with your grief. Also, maybe it is true that she was hoping to make the other cat less lonely. \n\nThat said, it is okay to not be ready for a new pet. Especially when you are still grieving the old. The new pet won't get the attention it deserves for being itself and will be compared to the pet that passed. Not fair to new pet at all. Plus, when cuddling new one, may have feelings of guilt which also aren't right.", "Nta. But I don't think it's bad to move on so fast. I had kitten died in front of me countless times. I just appreciate the next one. Everyone of them is different.", "NAH.  Part of the way people all grieve differently is how they approach successors to their beloved animal companions.  My service dog died 2 years ago almost exactly, and I\u2019m just now at the point where I\u2019m ready to apply for his successor (the service dog/handler relationship is different and more intimate than a pet, so it\u2019s not quite the same).  Some people want to get a new pet right away because the sense of their companion being missing is painful and a new pet will do some filling the hole their deceased pet has left  and will also distract them from the pain.\n\nNeither of you is wrong about wanting or not wanting a new pet.\n\nHowever, assuming that your dad and stepmom aren\u2019t as affected as you are because they aren\u2019t performing their grief for you isn\u2019t good.  It sounds like you know that\u2019s not a healthy thought, but you then kinda excused yourself for continuing to think that way.  In a marriage (or otherwise in a long term committed intimate relationship), it\u2019s not uncommon for people to minimize their vulnerability to others and only bare their emotions to their trusted partner.  This is especially true of men, and the older they are, the more common it is.", "NAH. I tend to need a replacement cat faster than some people. My husband and I adopted a few older, single cats in a row, and both times they passed away I broke down and got another one within a month. My friend on the other hand waited a year and a half to replace her dog.", "NAH. Nothing wrong with wanting a kitten. Nothing wrong with not wanting a kitten. SM should be a little bit more understanding of that, but the fact that she's willing to cancel the appointment shows that she at least respects your feelings a little bit. Sorry for your loss.", "NAH. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nEveryone grieves at different rates...SM is being kind of an AH for trying to to guilt you into getting a replacement cat when you are not ready.", "NTA. Peta are part of our lives and families, and they also deserve the time for your love and grieving to process at their loss.\n\nIt's not as simple as like replacing a broken toy. Some folks just don't understand (or care) that animals are also living creatures with their own unique personalities and behaviors.\n\nI think the intent was meant from a compassionate place, but obviously not well thought or timed. Sorry for the loss of your kitty :(", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You are fine not to want one.", "I'm the same way. The only thing that helps me through losing a cat, is getting a new one. The new kitty never takes the place of the old one. It sort of starts its own, new emotional \"account\" with me. And fills up the physical space very nicely. At this moment, we have a 5-month-old tearing round the rooms. He is nothing like the 16-year-old cat we lost in August, he is quite his own, but a great \"personality\" already. I know. Crazy cat person babbling.", "It keeps me from dwelling on the loss too much. I'm an overthinker and can get stuck with repetitive thoughts. Taking care of the new cat and getting them adjusted puts my thoughts in a more positive line of thinking. But I still miss all of them."]}
