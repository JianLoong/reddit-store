He can whine and complain about it, but once you offered him the solution to the problem he\u2019s making up, he scoffs at it because he\u2019s lazy.", "NTA.  Sounds like nobody points out that his situation is entirely his own doing, and he needs a wakeup call.  If you don\u2019t take on the responsibilities of parenting, you have to be content with what the custodial parent feels like giving you.", "NTA, you\u2019re absolutely spot on.\nHe\u2019s pretty far off from being a single father. Does he use that term to refer to himself?\nI bet he\u2019ll also be telling everyone that he paid for those extracurricular activities if the kid ends up being excelling at one of them. That his child support is what paid for them.\nSounds like he wants none of the responsibility and all of the glory.\nAnd that\u2019s why not everyone should have kids.", "He sounds more like an absentee parent than a single dad. NTA.", "He's not a single father. He might be single and a father, but as he's not the main caregiver who's taking care of a kid alone, he's not a single father. He is however quite delusional and self-pitying. Your reaction to his ridiculous behavior was absolutely appropriate. \n\nNTA", "NTA It's easier for him to badmouth his child's mother and paint her as a villain. Because otherwise he'd have to acknowledge that he is in a situation of his own making. \n\nHe can go for custody but he chooses not to. He wants to be seen as a good father but doesn't want to actually take on parenting responsibilities. \n\nHe's never going to admit it though. They never do.", "What an idiot! Jim had no business procreating with that attitude.\n\nNTA, OP", "NTA. As the mother works FT, presumably child-related costs are split so his child support is only a contribution to direct costs. It certainly won't be supporting her, or compensating her for a proportion of the time she's spending being the sole hands-on parent.", "He is a professional deadbeat Dad. He doesn't want to see his son any more than what he has now but he sure wants to appear that he does so he can attempt to feel better about himself. That's what deadbeat Dad's do. He should be thanking his ex for doing the extras for his son and being a good Mom, instead he wants to play the victim because it is about him after all./s\n\nAnd I'd bet 5 bucks that the child support he pays is garnished out of his paycheck. NTA.", "NTA. Some people just want to complain, and aren\u2019t actually interested in solutions. Like you, I have little patience for these people and probably would have said something similar.", "NTA You were right about everything you said. Jim has no one but himself to blame.", "Nta, this guy isn't a single parent. He is a sperm donor who pays child support", "NTA. This is too funny. Jim\u2019s a whinger who wants to talk the talk about seeing his son and then, when you propose a solution, he changes his tune.
