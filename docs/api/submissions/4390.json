I was honestly quite taken aback. It had quite a few expensive items, like a razor of high quality, some expensive shampoo and stuff, etc. Normally I would've just appreciated the gesture and thought of something I would gift her in a while or so but since I was leaving in a week I was out of ideas and I couldn't have matched the amount she spent on me (in such a short while) meaningfully so I took her out to dinner, thanked her for all that (I actually needed to buy quite a bit of that stuff) and then proceeded to wire her the bill amount next day.\n\n\nHer reaction... wasn't great, she was disappointed and said that it was a gift which shouldn't be paid back and stuff like that. I felt quite bad but absolutely refused her from paying any of that money back. Normally I wouldn't have paid this but it was quite an amount and I make a lot more money than her, so I felt awkward and was out of ideas. \n\n\nWe're over it now though but she's asked me to never do something like this again, and I've reluctantly agreed. I also kind of wanted to bring up the cost she put into the gift, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings at all. I'm not going to be able to talk to her for a month now and I'm feeling bad that I fucked up this badly.

It sounds like your girlfriend has a healthy attitude toward gift-giving that you should try to pick up. A gift is just that - a gift. It doesn't obligate the recipient to match it. If she gives you a birthday gift, or a holiday gift, of course you'll give her one as well. But making you a care package because you're going on board your ship is different. It's a gift from her, to you, freely given, and all you need to do is show appreciation.

There was ambiguity on both sides and you worked through it. \n\nThe timing sucks with you having to be gone for awhile. Take the time you have to talk to her about it.

The appropriate response to a gift is \"thank you.\" And yes, treating her to dinner was a lovely gesture. By wiring her money, you turned it into a transaction instead, which is rude and hurtful.", "Soft YTA, she did this as a gift because she loves you.\n\nYou absolutely can offer to cover some of the cost, treat her etc, but just outright paying her for the gift without discussion undermines the sentiment of giving the gift.", "YTA\n\nThat was an incredibly sweet thing for her to do. Throwing money in her face cheapened the point she was trying to make.", "YTA.  This was a cruel response to a kind gift.

Don't believe she can make responsible decisions?  This is so condescending.", "NTA\nAll relationships have moments where you find out that you see things differently.  She's trying to do something nice and you're trying to be considerate of her financial situation. If this kind of spending makes you uncomfortable then definitely have a conversation about it.

I appreciate it a lot though.", "Well we discussed that and I explained that part to her. That's kinda what got us over the entire thing. \n\n\nThe AITA post is for perspective on what I've done because I felt like my reaction to her reaction was not completely from what I would've done myself but doing everything in my power to not hurt her feelings. I didn't completely see the wrong in what I did.", "I wouldn't say badly. I get your perspective, you were trying to thank her by giving a gift of equal value. She just wanted to gift you something with no expectation of reciprocation. Personally, when you can talk to her thank her again, stress how you've used it, and apologize again. Let her know you were so grateful that you wanted to return the gesture. In the future you'll try to remember that not every gift needs to be reciprocated. And try to keep an eye out for opportunities to do something thoughtful for her she may not be expecting.", ">I guess. I wanted to match her gesture but couldn't do it on short notice.\n\nNot every gift requires a matched gesture. \n\nI am assuming that you treat her like a queen when you are home and able. Let her treat you like a king when she can. She most likely put a lot of time effort and research into making this package she made sure to get things done to try and make your life easier while you are away, I would do the same for my husband. \n\nDid you f-up ya you did. But just apologize and let her know that you were just shocked when it arrived that you didn't expect such a lavish gift and that you really loved and appreciated what she did for you and how sorry you are for offending her and making her feel like she couldn't afford to do something nice for you by for wiring her the money.", "You realise that she asked you what you took with you specifically so that she could buy those things and gift them to you, right?", "I want to say NTA but she's set a boundary and you need to respect that. If you feel bad about what she spent on you pay her back in other ways \"hey hun I got you these tickets to a spa for you and a girlfriend, I just really wanted to show you how much I appreciate you\" send flowers intermittently while your gone, gift her a gift card for dinners or something. \nI was very much like this years ago and had a really hard time accepting gifts, I totally get it, but respect how she feels about it.", "I really didn't think that she'll send me expensive hygiene products and quality winter gear (of my size) though. Those cost a lot of money.", "My husband once returned a few things because he felt I spent too much on him. It made me sad that I had put so much thought into his gifts but all he saw was money spent. It completely dismissed my intention and care. \n\nShe\u2019s probably doubting your interest. I hope you can explain yourself in a way she can understand. And I agree with whoever said spend your time apart thinking of a way to show her your feelings. As a gift giver it brings me joy to give a gift that the receiver didn\u2019t even know they wanted. Something that shoes you know and understand them. If someone ever did the same for me I\u2019d be floored.", "This is a NAH situation, especially since you guys were able to talk your way through the title issue.\n\nYour girlfriend wanted to make sure you were taken care of while she wasn't able to be near you. Giving you those things helped her.\n\nYou wanted to make sure that she wasn't putting herself in a bad spot financially just to give you the gifts.\n\nNeither are bad. Maybe next time stick to the snack and medicine and tell her you're good on the gear. From your description of your gf, showing her that you appreciate the gift seems to be all the repayment she wants.", "YTA but in kind of clueless way. Duuuuude. She loves you, she was happy to make you happy and you made her unhappy in return.  You meant well, but next time, just let people give you gifts.\n\nShe likely planned it, dude. She likely did not asked out of curiosity, she likely asked to know what to buy to you.\n\n> I'm not going to be able to talk to her for a month now and I'm feeling bad that I fucked up this badly. I have the next 4 days before we don't see each other for 3 months.\n\nTalk it out, talk it out. Talk about feelings, listen about her feelings and chances are, you two will come out of it stronger.", "Gentle YTA. She did a really nice thing for you and you turned it into a transaction. The nice dinner was a perfectly adequate thank you on its own.", "Yikes dude. You can just accept a gift. Not everything is a monetary transaction. You are treating her like a business acquaintance, not someone who may love you. YTA. Have fun at sea.", "NTA \n\nBut you might get her a gift card to somewhere she might not usually shop or just visa gift card and say it's bc you have no chance of selecting her such an incredible thoughtful and useful gift. \n\nMake it about matching her generosity not repaying. \n\nI've picked up a few things for my bf when he's been feeling unwell, and ended up asking if he wanted other stuff that i thought of and a few little snacks etc just bc he doesn't usually have the time.... He was super appreciative, paid me back (rounded way up) .... And i appreciated. \nI have no problem spending on gifts or even food we'll both eat but I did appreciate when i happily did an errand for him to not cover the cost. \n\n(He was sick and I was leaving town after visiting) \n\nMy point is - she viewed it as a gift. Reciprocate accordingly", "YTA. Yikes. I know you had the best intentions but this reaction would make me think you didn't expect the relationship to last while you were gone and you didn't want it to end with you \"owing her\" something. I would absolutely be pulling away or end it outright with the expectation that you planned to do the same. And you won't be able to talk for months!? Ouch. \nI would absolutely take her to dinner again, maybe even overnight in an exclusive hotel, and tell her in more detail why you reacted that way and how you feel about her. \nGood luck!", "YTA (a soft one). It was a gift with no strings attached. She was taking care of you how she knows best. Apologize for not accepting the gift in the spirit it was given. \nIt was an insult on your part to return the money. Even if you did not mean it that way. It sounds as if you may not be used to being on the receiving end of nice gifts. Realize the gem your gf is be happy she cares that much for you.", "Mild YTA. You should have just brought a cool gift back from your travels or gotten her a gift like a spa day to use while you\u2019re gone to say thanks.", "NAH.\n\nThis seems like a miscommunication of epic proportions. Maybe talk to one another about gift expectations, as it seems that you felt obligated to provide an equal gift and it doesn\u2019t sound like she expected that.\n\nSide note: it may be good to look into your guys love language so that each of you both can help make each other feel the most loved. If hers is gifts or acts of service then this was a loving gesture that just didn\u2019t connect, which would lead to hard feelings. If both of your love languages are different it is good to explore how you can connect with each other through them. Good luck!", "Light YTA. You didn\u2019t mean to be, but like others said, you cheapened her thoughtful gift.\n\nWhat does she like? Makeup? Perfume? Home dec? Fancy cocktails? Jump online, there\u2019s a lot of cool holiday packages rn. Find a high end brand advent calendar. Very cool sets of trial and full size stuff I\u2019d never splurge on for myself.\n\nETA: The gift (with a heartfelt note about how much you\u2019ll miss her, appreciate her, and love your relationship) can arrive while you\u2019re at sea. Order now.", "NAH. I'm the kind of person who might spend what the receiver sees as \"too much\" for a gift. Gift-giving is one of my love languages. But if I do that, it's because I want to. I know what my finances are, and I can choose to spend the extra money I do or don't have as I want. Hope going away for 3 months. She wanted to give you something nice, but that wouldn't be cumbersome, so she gave you things you needed. \n\nIt's kind of you to be concerned, but half the fun of giving gifts is doing it because you don't need to. I promise, a sincere thank you and the nice dinner would've been more than sufficient.\n\nIn the next few days, take an opportunity to reiterate your gratitude, and a quick apology for the check. Make sure she knows you only offered it out of concern, not as a rejection of her gift. You can let her know you're not comfortable receiving lavish gifts for future reference, but remember, she has fun getting them and giving them to you. Maybe you guys can come to an agreement that allows her to spoil you when she wants, but to a degree that doesn't make you feel guilty. My best friend and I have a price maximum for when I want to get him random gifts, and I'm not allowed to spend more on him for his birthday/Christmas than I'd be comfortable with him spending on me. (I hate the last part of this rule, but only because I'm the same way about receiving expensive things AND don't want to be restricted myself, haha.)", "YTA\n\nThis sounds like you have had some history with relationships (whether romantic, friend, or family) where you have been made to feel that you cannot \u201cowe\u201d anyone something. For some reason you don\u2019t feel that someone can do something for someone else because they want to and not because they are expecting something in return. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad guy, your tone here sounds like you just want to be a good boyfriend, but part of being in a relationship, especially a romantic partnership, is letting your partner express their love for you. Now, if your gf were constantly buying you things you didn\u2019t want or need and was expecting you to always perform gratitude that would be one thing. But it sounds like here she was thinking, he\u2019s going to be away for a long time and I love him and I want him to be as comfortable as possible while he\u2019s gone, what can I do before he leaves? Well, I can send him a nice care package. \n\nThe goal is that in a relationship, over time you will do things for each other. Everything is not measured tit for tat, no one is counting receipts, but that you are both doing things for the other because you love each other. And that you accept the gestures of love for that and not for something to go in a column of \u201cwell I did this for you\u201d. \n\nI may be off base with my original assumption, but it is something to think about how presents were treated either in your family of origin or in relationships with friends you had earlier in life. \n\nI know that if I did some nice gesture for my partner and he immediately paid me back I would feel a little icky. Like, I want to do this for him because I care, not because I\u2019m expecting him to give me money for it.", "NAH but this is a good lesson for you in making more than someone else. I grew up in a house with a very high income, and one thing that is good to learn is just because you make more than someone else doesn't always mean you can afford more, and it absolutely does not mean that you have any say to determine what someone else can afford.\n\n>it was quite an amount and I make a lot more money than her, so I felt awkward and was out of ideas. \n\nUnless you have evidence to the contrary, and by evidence I mean you know purchasing something put someone into debt that they are struggling with, a gift is a gift is a gift from someone. They decide what they can afford and what they can't. Even if someone decides to make a decision in their life that is directly related to lower funds because of a gift (e.g. I want to not go out to eat so I can afford a gift for someone), that is their decision and solely their own.\n\nI came from a very different income bracket than my husband, and when we'd have both our families out to dinner, my dad's wife would insist on covering the bill, or at LEAST their own part, never let my in laws pay because they didnt make as much. This caused a lot of insecurity/guilt for my in laws, and I had to have a conversation with my dad's wife that people dont typically offer to pay for something they arent able to afford, and for some, being able to treat someone they care about to something is as much a gift as the gift they're giving is for the recipient.\n\nLet your girlfriend treat you. Trust that she can manage her finances, that she knows what she can afford and how to afford it.", "Soft YTA. You should let people be nice to you.", "YTA - you paying her back was incredibly condescending. You owe her an apology, and if she wants to give you the money back, take it and put it towards buying her a surprise later. \n\nAlso - I find it odd that you say you couldn\u2019t match the amount she spent on you, but then you paid her back the amount she spent on you? Which is it?", "OP, I'm going to guess you haven't had a lot of others do really thoughtful and intentional gift giving to you. \n\nYour gf sounds extremely loving and thoughtful with her idea, and it's something that someone who's love language is gift giving. \nAnd gift givers tend to be people who's love language in return isn't generally gifts, but thoughtful acts of love. \n\nWrite that women a long sappy letter in a nice card (and mean every word... Something she can read while you are away especially when she misses you... And tuck in some gift cards to a spa or salon or coffee so when she's missing you she can have a self care cheer up day...

And like actual thoughtfulness... \nGet writing!", "YTA- There's no time limit on returning the gesture, and you could have ordered something online that she'd really appreciate to be delivered to her mid point of you being away. There are some lovely gift sets about this time of year especially!", "NAH. I completely understand this feeling, I get the idea of wanting to reciprocate.

She gave you a nice gift and gesture. You didn\u2019t have time to do something nice in return, and the key thing here is that is ok. You don\u2019t need to immediately return the favor.

You both sound like well intentioned people, good luck.", "NAH, I think I understand how she feels. There was a time when the guy I fell in love with had to work on a ship for months. And I want to do the same. I want to bought him things. I also asked him about sending parcels to the port. Because I want him to have enough stuff for the whole time he's on the ship. It's a gift of caring. And it's like I take care of him even though we're apart. It is something that I\u2019m willing to do. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure that you don't meant to deny her kindness.

Kind of like when I was dating (dinosaurs still roamed the earth) picking up the tab on a first date was a polite \u201cI enjoyed our time but don\u2019t see it continuing\u201d) Now, your generation has sort of muddied that system, but maybe *she* still interpreted it a similar way?

My current relationship is probably the only thing where I've let someone affect me emotionally this much, and she's made me a better person.

I'm working on it, slowly opening up, learning to rely on someone. I'm just not there yet, and this was a bit of a \"take aback\" to it... I still have a lot to learn.", "It wasn't on the spot, but that's beside the point. \n\nHe was not comfortable receiving a gift of that size. Gift giving is something they should have discussed earlier, but I don't fault him for paying her back. They can have a proper discussion about gift giving now to avoid this from occurring again though.", "It's possible to have good motives and still fuck up. You fucked up in how you handled it initially, yes. It doesn't make you a terrible horrible person, but in this situation you were an asshole and by dwelling now on whether you were right instead of whether the relationship has been made right, you are fucking up again. Focus on getting on the same page about the relationship before you leave. You don't want to be away while she has any doubt about how sincerely you care for her, are committed to her, and are grateful for the love she attempted to show you with this gesture. People make sacrifices to make their partner happy. That's what she tried to do for you, and she got a very unexpected reaction from you that has made her uneasy.", "I\u2019ve seen your replies throughout this post, I\u2019m just explaining how they come off. \n* I\u2019m used to being independent so I freaked out sounds commitment phobic. \n\n* my girlfriend took on part of what used to be solely my responsibility so it made me uncomfortable again sounds commitment phobic. \n\n* I feel like I put her in a financially precarious position when you didn\u2019t ask her to do this and you admit she is more frugal and smart with money than you in another comment is just downright offensive.\n\nJust tell her you\u2019re sorry, next time don\u2019t deny or pay her for gifts, and stop treating kind acts as a 1-1 exchange.", "Unfortunately, I can relate. It takes a lot of work to unlearn that degree of independence, and to learn that it can be safe to allow help. I'm still getting over it, and its been years of work. But it sounds like you're willing to start putting in that work, and that's the first step. You will probably fuck up again, that's part of the process, but if you can keep an open line of communication -- as you are doing -- then you and your relationship will come out stronger for it. I wish you the best.", "I would honestly tell her exactly what you wrote out here. She'll understand.", "Well, I've said sorry and I realize my approach sucked. I still have a lot of learning to do about what is a kind gesture and a \"gift\" because I'm not used to gifting as such, except one gift for christmas per year.", "Ok. I've been reading your comments and I understand deployments more than most (as a spouse not service member) and my care packages were soooo close to what you described she gave you. \n\nHere's what I think you're missing about what you did here:\n\n> \u201cIf your primary love language is gift-giving, it means that you express your love by giving others presents,\u201d Guerra says. \u201c**The gift is an overt demonstration of your love and appreciation for the person receiving it.**\u201d \n\n> The gifts \u201ctend to be personalized\u201d and are designed to \u201cbring joy and pleasure\u201d to the person you\u2019re giving them to.\n\nEmphasis is mine but imo, that's why she was hurt. Also why you should never ever try to pay for a gift again. It's probably felt like a literal rejection to her. \n\nI don't think you're an asshole but you seem to be a little emotionally inexperienced. Just the way you describe your independence sounds like a coping mechanism, and probably not a healthy one. (It's isolating)", "Realllyyyyyy better hope you guys are in contact while you're gone because this level of patronizing jerkitude will have her thinking and you might not like the outcome when you're back. You don't trust her to be able to handle her own finances, you threw a thoughtful and kind gift back in her face, you're doubling down on it instead of just saying fucking thank you. Yeah, I'd be reconsidering whether I'd wanna wait for you if i were her."]}
