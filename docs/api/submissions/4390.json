Out of curiousity, my girlfriend [24F] asked me what kind of stuff I usually take with myself aboard the ship, so I listed out the stuff like a bunch of men's hygiene stuff, some of my favorite snacks, a bunch of socks, some waterproof winter gear, stomach medicine, etc.\n\n\nShe went ahead and bought a bunch of that stuff for me yesterday and had it delivered to my place along with a note. I was honestly quite taken aback. It had quite a few expensive items, like a razor of high quality, some expensive shampoo and stuff, etc. Normally I would've just appreciated the gesture and thought of something I would gift her in a while or so but since I was leaving in a week I was out of ideas and I couldn't have matched the amount she spent on me (in such a short while) meaningfully so I took her out to dinner, thanked her for all that (I actually needed to buy quite a bit of that stuff) and then proceeded to wire her the bill amount next day.\n\n\nHer reaction... wasn't great, she was disappointed and said that it was a gift which shouldn't be paid back and stuff like that. I felt quite bad but absolutely refused her from paying any of that money back. Normally I wouldn't have paid this but it was quite an amount and I make a lot more money than her, so I felt awkward and was out of ideas. \n\n\nWe're over it now though but she's asked me to never do something like this again, and I've reluctantly agreed. I also kind of wanted to bring up the cost she put into the gift, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings at all. I'm not going to be able to talk to her for a month now and I'm feeling bad that I fucked up this badly. I have the next 4 days before we don't see each other for 3 months. \n\n\nSo well, AITA for paying her back money for an expensive gift, which I needed?", "created_utc": 1670674265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhr27p/aita_for_paying_my_girlfriend_money_for_a/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or is it just because you make more money therefore she can't get you expensive gifts? She was doing something nice for you. It doesn't matter if it was a bit pricy- it was her choice.\n\n But by paying her back like that, you're indicating that because you make more she doesn't get to do something like that as a surprise.

It sounds like your girlfriend has a healthy attitude toward gift-giving that you should try to pick up. A gift is just that - a gift. It doesn't obligate the recipient to match it. If she gives you a birthday gift, or a holiday gift, of course you'll give her one as well. But making you a care package because you're going on board your ship is different. It's a gift from her, to you, freely given, and all you need to do is show appreciation. Taking her out to dinner was good; paying her back was wrong.\n\nThe signal you probably sent was that you aren't serious about her and don't want to accept gifts that big from her when the relationship won't last.

Next time accept the gift and just think of thoughtful things you can do for her to show her your appreciation as well.", "NAH\n\nIt was a simple miscommunication between the two of you. She intended it as a gift, and you misinterpreted it as helping you out (as in the effort to gather the items was the gift), and because the items were overly generous you reimbursed her.\n\nYou probably should've opened a dialogue instead of assuming, and she probably should've been clear about it being a gift. There was ambiguity on both sides and you worked through it. \n\nThe timing sucks with you having to be gone for awhile. Take the time you have to talk to her about it.

The appropriate response to a gift is \"thank you.\" And yes, treating her to dinner was a lovely gesture. By wiring her money, you turned it into a transaction instead, which is rude and hurtful.", "Soft YTA, she did this as a gift because she loves you.\n\nYou absolutely can offer to cover some of the cost, treat her etc, but just outright paying her for the gift without discussion undermines the sentiment of giving the gift.", "YTA\n\nThat was an incredibly sweet thing for her to do. Throwing money in her face cheapened the point she was trying to make.", "YTA.  This was a cruel response to a kind gift.

Don't believe she can make responsible decisions?  This is so condescending.", "NTA\nAll relationships have moments where you find out that you see things differently.  She's trying to do something nice and you're trying to be considerate of her financial situation. If this kind of spending makes you uncomfortable then definitely have a conversation about it.

I wanted to match her gesture but couldn't do it on short notice. Guess I really did fuck up badly.", ">Do you write out a cheque every time someone gives you a gift? Do you expect other people to?\n\n\nNo it definitely wasn't like that for me... I just felt awkward because of the bill amount. Had I not literally just exploded a list of everything I take and use on the job, she would've spent lesser because she matched like 90% of the stuff I told her and then some! I kinda felt like I put her in a position where she has to do something grand to see me off which she absolutely didn't have to. I appreciate it a lot though.", "Well we discussed that and I explained that part to her. That's kinda what got us over the entire thing. \n\n\nThe AITA post is for perspective on what I've done because I felt like my reaction to her reaction was not completely from what I would've done myself but doing everything in my power to not hurt her feelings. I didn't completely see the wrong in what I did.", "I wouldn't say badly. I get your perspective, you were trying to thank her by giving a gift of equal value. She just wanted to gift you something with no expectation of reciprocation. Personally, when you can talk to her thank her again, stress how you've used it, and apologize again. Let her know you were so grateful that you wanted to return the gesture. In the future you'll try to remember that not every gift needs to be reciprocated. And try to keep an eye out for opportunities to do something thoughtful for her she may not be expecting.", ">I guess. I wanted to match her gesture but couldn't do it on short notice.\n\nNot every gift requires a matched gesture. \n\nI am assuming that you treat her like a queen when you are home and able. Let her treat you like a king when she can. She most likely put a lot of time effort and research into making this package she made sure to get things done to try and make your life easier while you are away, I would do the same for my husband. \n\nDid you f-up ya you did. But just apologize and let her know that you were just shocked when it arrived that you didn't expect such a lavish gift and that you really loved and appreciated what she did for you and how sorry you are for offending her and making her feel like she couldn't afford to do something nice for you by for wiring her the money.", "You realise that she asked you what you took with you specifically so that she could buy those things and gift them to you, right?", "I want to say NTA but she's set a boundary and you need to respect that. If you feel bad about what she spent on you pay her back in other ways \"hey hun I got you these tickets to a spa for you and a girlfriend, I just really wanted to show you how much I appreciate you\" send flowers intermittently while your gone, gift her a gift card for dinners or something. \nI was very much like this years ago and had a really hard time accepting gifts, I totally get it, but respect how she feels about it.", "I really didn't think that she'll send me expensive hygiene products and quality winter gear (of my size) though. Those cost a lot of money."]}
