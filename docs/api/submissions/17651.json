Now that you are vulnerable, the bio dad who you never really knew, wants in on what your mom and SD built and left you.", "**Your parents worked hard and made sure that** ***you*** **would have some provision** on their death.  You used your inheritance from them, to plan for your future, so that you will be able to be on your own for as long as possible.  That's the result of hard work, by first your parents that were actually in your life, and then by you. \n\nNow, **these people come in and expect to force you to comply with their demand** that you give that provision over to them.\n\n*I have been politely declining,* \n\n**Normal people would accept your decision, the first time.**  They would not keep on pushing.   I suspect, because I've seen it too often by manipulative people, that this is a pattern of behavior for this man and his new family, to push and demand and blame and manipulate until other people give in and he gets what he wants.  \n\n**You said \"no.\"  That should have been the end of that discussion.**  If you were being respected by them, it would have been.\n\n*but I've had enough,* \n\nGood for you.  **Boundaries are important**. Standing up to bullies is important. Standing up to the disrespect, that's important.\n\n*so I told him to chose: never bring up moving in with me again, and maintain our relationship; or continue to push, and have me go back to being NC.*\n\n**This is a very reasonable boundary.**  \n\nYou said 'no' to their demand, and they should have accepted it and dropped it.  They haven't.  They are pushing, manipulating and demanding you give in.  That's them stomping all over your boundary.  \n\nThis choice you gave him is **how you are now having to enforce your boundary because he won't respect you and your decisions.**\n\nAll you are asking is for him to be respectful, to respect your life and your decisions as yours to make, and to stop trying to discuss a decision that is made.  That's reasonable.  If the relationship is important to you, he would not have any trouble doing this, and wouldn't be objecting to it.  That they are objecting to reasonable boundaries, and reasonable levels of respect for you as a person who makes your own decisions for yourself, shows that they want something from you other than a relationship that's healthy.\n\nI think you are going to have to go NC again.  Or you are going to have to be always on the alert for him to try again to get something from you. \r  \n\r  \n*Now his wife and other kids are calling me an AH for giving him an ultimatum like that.* \n\nIn therapy subs, this is called flying monkeys.  He's got his wife and kids working for him, so he doesn't have to work so hard to get his wants. \n\n**If they had respected your answer, you wouldn't have had to enforce the boundary by laying out the choice like this**.  That you had to do this at all, it's on them.  \n\nThe reason they are taking this to the level of insults and false accusations, is because you haven't yet given in and complied to their demands.  They expect to win this, because this is what they want from you.   That's ***typical behavior of manipulators and abusers, to refuse to accept your decision, and then use anything and everything that might force you into compliance,*** no matter how it hurts you.\n\n*So AITA?*\n\nNTA.  Not at all.  **These are people that see no problem with saying hurtful things to you, insulting you and making false accusations, just to get your compliance** to their ridiculous, and invasive, and controlling, demand.  \n\nYou don't have the kind of relationship with them that would be needed for them to even ask this of you in the first place.  For them to continue to demand this, after you said no, only shows that they do not care about you at all, only about what they can get from you.  \n\nYou are not obligated to support the person that abandoned you when you were a child and his responsibility.  That you even were in contact with him at all should have been enough for him, but he's pushing for you to be his support now.  **He didn't do the job of father for you.  You do not owe him anything, as a parent,  when he didn't do the job**.
