(I don't know if it's a fair comparison, correct me if I'm misunderstanding.) Americans can be so damn sensitive.  \n\nI promise it's not all Americans, not even most. The Bible Belt bigots just like to be extra vocal and, unfortunately, they seem to get the most media presence. It's a scary world we live in when someone has to be quiet about who they are or literally risk getting un-alived.", "Well that's a fun twist! Mad love for giving the little ones some positive influence even if just for a little bit.", "I would like to sign up for my free eagle too please.", "Yeah OP got conned into full time babysitting for the duration of the stay.", "Yes, the only payment i ask is pats for my dog because hes a good boy.", "I think its just because i dote on my bf quite a bit, ya know, what loving couples do haha. And while im straight passing its pretty obvious my boyfriend is what those bigots would call the \"man\" of the relationship.", "In kind of a similar situation with 14m. I have a feeling hes queer in someway but just keeps quiet because of his parents. Im glad hes here tho, been getting a lot of questions from him about queer relationships, the community and also akward questions about sex. Even though its awkward im glad his comfortable enought to ask and hopefully leads him to beong comfortable enough to talk to me if he does discover hes queer or questioning.", "No doubt that if they were with their parents they would be doing what their parents want to do. At least this way we can actually have fun and do what they want for a change.", "To be fair, he doesn't seem to have a problem with it. Clearly loves those kids and is a good influence on them.", "You may regret saying this as we are all now coming to stay at yours and want to see the Eagle!\n\nETA: so NTA. You're an awesome cousin and your uncle/aunt need to sort their heads out!!", "Dog? That clinches it.\n\nYou're too young to be my Uncle, so your new Surrogate Aunty here would like to book a couple of nights, please.", "I would give him ALL the pats! Dog tax?", "Ask if he's so straight, why is he concerned about two men in the bedroom", "You're his safe space! Even if he chooses not to reveal too much, he will at least know that you are the safest person to just be around.", "OP should open an AirBnB, half of us in here would be signing up to stay", "[removed]"]}
