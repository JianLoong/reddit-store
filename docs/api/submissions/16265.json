When he was little he was very flamboyant but he's much more quiet now at gatherings. He has not and probably won't for a long long time bring any partner he has home to visit or to gatherings. I know he's dating but the one time he was going to open up about it one of SILS kids came in so we hushed. I want to know about his life because I love him and he deserves to be able to brag about his happiness. He is working abroad right now and he loves the freedoms it gives but misses his family.
