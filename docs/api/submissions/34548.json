But there are other questions- are your parents booking their own rooms or trying to squeeze in? How did this change things like renting a car (car for 4 is a lot cheaper/easier than a car for 6), planned activities (can everyone do the hike), or any other logistics? \n\nYou all as a group needed to decide this was a good idea.

Here is the thing, just because both sides of the family get along, does not necessarily mean that they would choose to vacation together.  Four days seems like a long time to me.  Perhaps if you were getting together for a meal, or an overnight visit, but 4 days?  This is my perspective, my daughter and her husband live close to us, as does my son-in-law's mother and father.  At holidays, we might  see his Dad at Thanksgiving Dinner, or when we all go out on New Years Eve, maybe his Mom will go too.  (His parents are divorced.)  Its nice to see them occasionally, but I'm talking 4 or 5 hours max, not 4 days at a time.   We may have our kids in common, but that is the extent of it.  We live different lives, have different perspectives and not all that much in common.  Would we be friends if our kids weren't married?

But you didn\u2019t mention any of that and did mention joining a \u201cfamily vacation\u201d which makes it sound like this is a vacation your wife\u2019s family is planning, in which case you\u2019d be a massive asshole for inviting your parents on your wife\u2019s family\u2019s vacation without rubbing it by them first. \n\nWithout that information it\u2019s hard to say whether you\u2019re both being unreasonable or you\u2019re 100% in the wrong.", "YTA if anyone involved in the original vacation is remotely reluctant and it seems your wife is. \u2018Have met and get on\u2019 does not equal \u2018would love to spend an important family birthday and vacation together\u2019.", "I think when you invite someone on a vacation organised for someone else's birthday celebration (especially without checking everyone is genuinely okay with it *first*),it's always a YTA situation. \n\nNot really sure how you thought this was normal or acceptable behaviour?", "NAH. It makes sense financially, but it\u2019s also a bit weird that you invite your parents along on a vacation planned with your wife\u2019s family.", "YTA for inviting them before making sure everyone else is OK with it. I don't think it's awful if your wife and your parents were all for it too.", "This.\n\nWhile you are being sensible with logistics, you did not take their emotions into consideration.\n\nDid you clear it with your wife and her parents? Given this trip was planned to celebrate her father's 80th birthday, he might have just wanted to celebrate his birthday with this tirp and and his closest family. Inviting other people on their family's vacation - even if it was your parents - is rude as heck. \n\nYour parents could be the most delightful, easiest going people ever but it is still incredibly rude to invite them on your IL's family vacation.\n\nYTA", "Yeah but he is stuck with her parents for 2 weeks! Yikes.", "Imo he should ask his in law too. Who knows, maybe the parents  in law want to celebrate the dad bday with only their children + spouse n grandchild.

The 80 year old may want a quiet holiday whereas the 70 year old might want to be more active. I would be pissed if I had a clear view around the holiday I wanted and then potentially have to compromise because some uninvited guests were sprung on me", "Exactly. Most people can get along for a dinner or party, but a holiday is another matter altogether. OP's wife probably wanted to celebrate her dads 80th and make it about him, without her in-laws.", "Probably because he knew she would object.", "I think she means that his parents aren't part of her parents' family. Her parents planned a birthday-celebration-vacation for their own family, which includes OP and his wife, and without asking them OP decided to bring along some of his own family members who his wife's parents barely know.", "Because it\u2019s her fathers 80th and it\u2019s a family vacation for him? His daughter\u2019s husband\u2019s parents are not his family, so yeah it\u2019s quite rude of OP to invite them along without asking.", "Do you just invite your parents along to your father in law's birthday party without checking with them that it is okay?\n\nNo. It would be rude to do so.\n\nI'll use this as an example. My parents are celebrating their 50th anniversary this summer in another part of the country. All my siblings and our families are going on the trip to celebrate them, too. If my BIL suddenly invited his parents to join without clearning it with my parents, my sister would catch heck from my parents because the trip was supposed to be their time with their kids and their kids' families. \n\nThis situation is no different. Op and his wife are going on a trip with his ILs to celebrate his FIL's 80th birthday. He didn't clear it with his FIL first to make sure it was okay with him. He just invited his parents on his father in law's birthday trip and decided that everyone would be fine with it. Now, his wife is going to have to explain to her parents why her husband's parents are crashing her Dad's 80th birthday trip. \n\nLogistically it might make sense to OP but it doesn't FEEL good to the people who planned the trip to celebrate their own family member's milestone.", "Because it\u2019s HER family\u2019s vacation.

I don\u2019t get how it would be reasonable to spend their entire vacation on her parents when his dad is turning 70.", "Was about to type the exact same thing, her attitude needs checking.\n\nHer parents are family but OPs are what exactly??", "And his wife's parents?", "I don't know how the wife is an arsehole here? \n\nThey are going on her dad's birthday holiday, and OP invited HIS parents without asking her or her parents. It is most bizarre.", "I think the wife chose her words very poorly, but I get what she meant.  She was probably trying to say that she wanted to celebrate her dad's 80th birthday with his family, which of course she's part of, but the in-laws are not part of her dad's family. \n\nSome people might see it differently, of course.", "Op's parents aren't family to his wife's parents.", "How is it weird?  He invited his parents to join him and his wife on a holiday celebrating his wife's father's 80th birthday. It's not just \"Oh, we'll be in Toytown on those dates for no good reason, come along as well.\"\n\nOP says the parents get on, but there's no info as to how often these people see each other, if they're just polite for the occasional dinner party etc.  This changes the whole dynamic of the trip.", ">????  Your wife's reaction is whats weird.  VERY weird.   Baffling really,  and a not so subtle dig on your folks.  Its weird that parents would join a family vacation?   I mean seriously?\n\nHow is it weird?\n\nHe's not inviting his parents to join them for dinner. He invited his parents to join his wife's parents vacation. Yes, he and his wife will be on the vacation, too, but he invited his parents to join his wife's parents' family vacation celebrating her father's 80th birthday. And it certainly doesn't sound like he cleared it with his wife's parents.\n\nThat is just flat out rude. I'd be peeved at my husband if he did that, too.", "I don\u2019t really think wife\u2019s reaction is so weird. It sounds like he just decided this without even thinking of asking wife or her parents if it\u2019s okay. When you have friends that happen to be in the same place, are you with others and unilaterally decide that those people are joining the vacation? Also, now what about logistics, are the parents expecting to be given accommodations in the hotel room before going off to do their own things? The days they are there, are they okay with doing anything already preplanned? I would assume op now expects his parent\u2019s interests to be taken into account even though he didn\u2019t even ask if it\u2019s okay for them to join.", "They weren't originally planning to be there when he was. He actually had them move their plans so they could join another vacation.", "The problem is that he invited them willy nilly to his inlaws birthday trip. Now his wife has to explain this is to her parents. I'd be mad too.", "Do her parents have to consider his parents family?", "No, the vacation was planned specifically to celebrate his wife's father's 80th birthday. That is the reason they are going on this vacation. It would be different if they were staying on after her family's vacation for an extra few days to spend time with his family but instead he invited people who are aquaintances of his ILs to spend his ILs birthday trip with them without their consent.", "This is not HIS vacation, this is his FIL's 80th birthday vacation that he and his wife decided to join.", "It is his wife's father's vacation that they were invited to. It's common courtesy to ask before adding to that. He's even more of an asshole if his father-in-law paid for it.", "Do you think every birthday party you attend is YOUR birthday party?", "Or her parents won't see  his parents as family.", "He made the unilateral decision. He\u2019s the only one getting his \u201cway.\u201d", "You don't invite someone to someone else's birthday celebration, vacation, wedding.. whatever without talking to the group first.", "Everyone is NOT happyThat's the whole point. . They were not even asked.", "I am wondering if she phrased it that way because her parents made plans and invited them on their birthday vacation. Op admits that it is something they can't really   normally afford. Are they able to go this time because his inlaws paid? That would definitely be weird to invite your parents to join you on..", "Do her parents have to think of his parents as family?", "I have a lot of family members I wouldn\u2019t want to be on vacation with at the same time.", "So, one person made a unilateral decision, but it\u2019s the other person who is controlling\u2026", "To invite your parents to your inlaws birthday celebration??", "Yes.\n\nYou don\u2019t drop this on people. You should have talked to your wife about it before discussing it with your parents.", "But he already agreed to that before hand. I am wondering if the reason they can even do this vacation and not another one for a while is if the mother is paying for it for her husband. That would also change things and explain why he was all cool with using his vacation as a celebration to begin with.", "He CHOSE to do it.", "I would be more worried about this guy being stuck with his asshole wife when his parents die after never seeing them because she doesn\u2019t think he should", "My thought is they spend the 4 days with his parents and then they still have 10 days with her parents. Why not do both? \n\nI get not having everyone in the same house/rental/hotel for 4 days - that\u2019s a lot if you aren\u2019t close - but I see no reason OP and his wife can\u2019t split the time.", "To me it sounds like he is piggybacking of the wife\u2019s family\u2019s trip. \n\nHer family was travelling together to celebrate the fathers 80th birthday, not her father-in-laws birthday. it\u2019s really weird to invite two people who were never invited to a trip that isn\u2019t even celebrating you. \n\nIf he was wanting to do this why not just extend the trip to celebrate his father\u2019s birthday? Or just choose a few days from the trip instead of making the wife\u2019s family spend 4 days with their daughters in-laws. I know I wouldn\u2019t want to change what I intended to do on holidays for those 4 days to celebrate someone I don\u2019t really know.\n\nEdit: people! How is it not obvious that you don\u2019t invite people on a holiday you didn\u2019t organise/didn\u2019t even bother to communicate to see if that\u2019s ok?!? Particularly when you involve people outside of yourself!", "I think the problem here is OP is leaving out some very important info. \n\nWho planned this vacation?\n\nIf OP and their wife planned it and invited wife\u2019s family along, then OP is wrong for not discussing with wife, but wife would frankly be wrong for saying no when her family was invited. But OP never says that and mentions something about wife being mad OP invited their parents on a \u201cfamily vacation\u201d. That makes it sound like wife\u2019s family planned the vacation, in which case no, you absolutely do not invite your parents without talking to everyone and making sure that\u2019s okay. \n\nWithout that info I can\u2019t say whether OP is a mild AH for not asking but wife is also being one, or whether OP is a massive asshole and wife is absolutely correct.", "He could, and he was feree to plan it for any other time.", "It's her father birthday, so his parents aren't her father family...", "It depends. This was a family holiday to celebrate dad's 80th.. does that mean that him and his wife invited op and his wife? Are op and his wife paying for this? He mentions that they don't have a lot of money. I know when I didn't have a lot of money, my stepmother paid for my daughter and I to come on a trip with them. It was a total surprise for my dad, and he loved it. If her parents paid for a family vacation, meaning that they paid for op and his wife, then that phrase works.", "Chopped liver?", "Same! Only her parents are family NTA", "His responsibility is to his wife. As far as his wife\u2019s parents, for me, that would depend on if they\u2019re paying for the vacation or not. If OP is paying for his immediate family and his wife\u2019s parents then it\u2019s his money his vacation. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re all going to be sleeping in the same bed.", "It doesn't say that at all. OP just mentions that it's his FIL's 80th. He doesn't say it's the reason for the vacation. And really? Acquaintances? And where does it say that the in-laws planned this vacation?", "You're assuming that. Nowhere does it say that it's his FIL's 80th birthday vacation. He mentions it's his FIL's birthday and mentions it's his father's birthday. There isn't a single point where he says it's a vacation his in-laws planned for FIL's birthday nor that they are tagging along on. Frankly, if that's the case, then he should bow out and say sorry, but he is going to spend his one vacation with his dad on his 70th birthday.", "Where does it say that it's his FIL's vacation that they were invited to? Oh right... it doesn't.", "Do you have trouble reading? Where did I say anything even remotely like that?", "That's definitely true. If OP's parents aren't paying their own way, that would change things.", "But did he \u201creally\u201d agree or was it one of those here\u2019s the plan honey..", "Yeah that\u2019s the problem here. If OP and wife planned the vacation then I can understand OP wanting to invite their parents if wife invited hers, OP should have just discussed it first.\n\nBut it kinda sounds like this was the wife\u2019s family\u2019s vacation. If so OP is being a massive asshole by inviting other people on that trip without discussing it.", "The OP said it was likely to be their only holiday that year so probably not.", "Bro you and OP both know this isn't what she means based on context y'all are just playing dumb at this point to make her the bad guy. It's so funny.", "Well, op just merrily invited his parents to his father in law's birthday vacation....", "First couple of sentences. It's his wife's father's birthday  and they are going on vacation with them for almost 2 weeks.

They were originally planning to go a couple of weeks earlier. I am thinking that op and his wife may only be able to go because her parents are paying for them, which would make it his wife's family's vacation.", "Then he could have said no then. Either way, it's an asshole move to invite other people on a vacation without talking to the original group first.", "So you're just gonna make things up and base your conclusions on that? Ahh, reddit.", "So it\u2019s even weirder he didn\u2019t run it by his wife first then, isn\u2019t it?", "Then discuss it when his wife first mentioned the two week trip.", "Exactly. I understand OP wants to spend time with his parents too which is why I think he should ve just discussed it with his wife first before inviting his parents to someone' else vacation. Perhaps his wife would suggest them to go separately (means she spends time w her parents while OP with his.

Of course it makes sense in order to see his parents hey move up your trip so we can overlap and see ALL family. He doesn\u2019t need wife\u2019s permission.

Depends, are you trying to co-opt your FIL\u2019s birthday and celebrate your father\u2019s at the same time? Because it kind of sounds that way. I notice your parents didn\u2019t invite you & your wife to go with them to this country. You 100% should have asked your wife first before suggesting it to your parents. That being said, if the parents get along & your in-laws have no objection to this plan, then learn your lesson on this one about communication with your spouse and have a good trip.

I only get so many vacations a year. \n\nMy parents planned a family vacation to FL this year right before Christmas as our gift. My parents work for themselves and are solidly middle class. They pay for the rental and we cover travel, food, everything else ourselves. \n\nThe weather was awful, cold and cloudy, so we stayed in but did all go putt-putt one day. About 30 min away in St. Petersburg there is a Salvador Dali museum. I love art (studied it and make it), have an interest in him but wouldn\u2019t consider myself a fan... but what a great opportunity to see in person! *AND* they have Impressionists on loan in an exhibit... Monet, Renoir, I\u2019m in! \n\nWe had been watching the weather leading up so my husband and I were actually excited the weather would be bad so we could justify going lol. Originally it was just us, but I invited my parents and brother/SIL, they have a toddler so gracefully declined. \n\nBefore we booked ticket online my mom\u2019s friend calls... a very well off friend who owns a home in FL and comes down for months... for decades. \n\nMom mentions I\u2019m going to the Dali museum... friend asks \u201cThe Dolly Museum, like Dolly Parton?\u201d - mom explains no Dali the artist her friend says: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go!!\u201d (Big eye roll from me, she has the time and money so why hadn\u2019t she done it?!) \n\nMom invites her friend along. If you know this woman, she is nice, but self centered in the way that having a ridiculous amount of wealth can do. I knew she would bulldoze and want to lead the whole trip... so I had my mom book the Dali 360 experience for them where art is projected onto a dome room... so my husband and I could actually browse the gallery together at our pace, talking or not talking, making inappropriate jokes, enjoying each other without two 60 yr old women. \n\nWe met up with them in the gallery for like 45 mins where she saw all the wanted quickly. At lunch time friend was ready to eat so we had to join them in the cafe and make conversation so she didn\u2019t feel totally put out. \n\nBy noon she was ready to go. I could have taken a loop around the gallery one more time... so that was frustrating. \n\nThe one day I had planned for my husband and I to enjoy, alone if no one wanted to join, was hijacked by someone I would never have invited because I kindly asked my parents to join. Since mom\u2019s friend came my dad stayed at the condo alone while my brother, SIL, and niece went to a nearby children\u2019s museum. \n\nIt\u2019s just shitty. \n\nI like the lady okay, if I\u2019m invited somewhere with her I am kind and personable... but I do not want to spend my family vacation with her. I do not want to capitulate to a non family member on a day trip I planned that I\u2019m the ONLY reason we went on? \n\nAnyway, can you tell I\u2019m still bitter?

Whether you get along with them or not is irrelevant. A lot of people can get along well for a family gathering for a few hours but maybe not for 4 days.
