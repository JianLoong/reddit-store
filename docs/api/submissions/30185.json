Some of the family members on the flight include my husband (28M), our kids (5M and 3M), my parents (52M and 53F), and my sister Michelle (33F). Michelle has two boys with her husband (33M), her two boys are Herbert (15M) and Denver (13M). Herbert also has a boyfriend, Mickey (15M). \r  \n\r  \nDue to how we bought the tickets, I was sitting right ahead of Herbert, Mickey and Denver, while my sister was multiple rows ahead of us. For most of the flight, Denver was just reading a book he had got that was some autobiography of some baseball player he likes, he was also playing some baseball game on the Nintendo DS. \r  \n\r  \nHerbert and Mickey were talking to each other during the flight, sometimes I'd chime in with their conversations. This was going fine at the beginning of the flight. Eventually, Denver had put his stuff down and started talking with me, Herbert and Mickey. Herbert and Mickey were talking about their relationship, I asked Denver if there was anyone he liked, and he mentioned a girl. He then started talking about how one of th boys on his baseball team that he's friends with said he was asexual. When that happened, Mickey and Herbert started to say stuff that annoyed Denver, first they said that his asexual friend was just \"looking for attention\" and that asexuals are \"trying to take over the community\". I tried stopping the boys, but they wouldn't. Herbert then started complaining about a transgender boy that Denver is friends with, mocking him for how he looks and sounds. I told him to stop but he wouldn't. \r  \n\r  \nHerbert and Mickey then said that Denver was a \"weakling\" for getting upset, and suggested the reason I was upset was that Iwas \"probably menstrating\". At this point, I started to scold (but not yell) at them, saying that if they keep running their mouths, they will get fired one day from a job and that I wouldn't feel pity for them. I told Herbert I would be telling Michelle about this and he told me to \"go ahead\".\r  \n\r  \nOnce we landed, got our suitcases and were getting ready to get to the hotel, I had told Michelle about what happened, she just laughed and said \"boys will be boys\". I asked what she meant by this and learned that Hebert and Mickey had recently got in trouble multiple times at school for saying mean things to other students, including minorites and some girls. She told me that Herbert and Mickey will \"be fine\" and how \"people said worse when we were in high school and they have jobs\". She said I should just \"worry about my own kids\" and accused me of trying to \"usurp\" her authority and said I was acting like an a-hole.
