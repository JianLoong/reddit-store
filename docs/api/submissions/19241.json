My sister (24F) is living at her friends house and says they are cool with me crashing for the summer. I only need about three months anyways. When I show up the place is a MESS and even worse the room I was suppose to take is a dump ground for my sisters stuff. The kitchen is cluttered and disgusting. The bathroom is cluttered, moldy, and stinky. I decided to stay anyways because hey free rent. Over the course of the past month I have been cleaning and decluttering everywhere I could. I cant believe her friend puts up with her actually I can she is also responsible for the mess. I have thrown away countless cups, plates, canned food, candy, pasta, coffee, tea, hair accessories, cheap rings, sandals, Tupperware, trash, clothes, hats, countless socks etc. I know it sounds like this stuff could have been donated but all of her clutter comes from cheap dollar stores. They both love having me as a roommate because they think I am handy. I am. \n\nSlowly my sister has been noticing her stuff missing. She has questioned me and even called me asking if I have seen her shoes or whatever. I just deny seeing it and say I only throw away expired food, duplicates, or broken stuff. I am able to get away with throwing stuff out because I only do it on trash day. lol. Yesterday I messed up though because I forgot it wasn't trash day. I had filled the trashcan with a bunch of my sisters clothes and I was to lazy to take the trash out. She rarely uses the kitchen trashcan anyways since she doesn't clean up after herself. I was wrong and she noticed. I came home to an emptied out kitchen trashcan in the middle of the kitchen and she demanded I explain my self. I simply said that I had a \"trash box\" and a \"good box\" and that I emptied out the wrong box while I was decluttering the laundry room. She didn't buy it. I am doing her a favor and her friend a favor but they just don't see it. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Okay people I am the asshole. After reading many comments and arguing with yall I see it now. I still need time to think about what to do next but I for sure need to apologize and offer to replace everything.\n\nWhat I have learned:\n-I was essentially stealing\n-They didn't ask for my help\n-My actions make hoarding worse (not sure if its full on hoarding but i am not helping)\n-They are doing me a massive favor not the other way around\n-I am a guest\n\nDetail I left out: \n-I have no job.\n-I got kicked out of last apartment because landlord wanted her daughter to move in closer to her\n-I am sleeping on the couch because thats the only space available for the moment", "created_utc": 1686168000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143n956/aita_for_slowly_throwing_away_all_of_my_sisters/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead you took it upon yourself to clear out stuff *you* didn't consider important without taking yr sister's feelings into consideration.\n\nEven worse, you lied about it! Yr sister noticed things missing. That was the time to come clean. Instead you denied even seeing the things that you were busily throwing away.\n\nIt wasn't your place to do that. You weren't doing anyone a \"favor.\" You were being a bit of a bully.\n\nAdmit what you did to your sister. Apologize. Offer to replace items you've thrown out.

You want somewhere cleaner, go pay to stay somewhere.", "Honestly, I see why you were kicked out the first time and I would kick you out of my place.

I get where you are coming from in wanting to clean & declutter, but you are obviously throwing away things she uses. This also isn\u2019t going to teach her how to not be messy or over collect.

As long as you're throwing it away, make a pile of clothes and personal items and at least you've tidied up and they can chose to get their stuff or leave it in that pile.

If your sister has a hoarding problem this isn\u2019t the way to help. \n\nDo you have another apartment lined up?  Get out as soon as you can. This isn\u2019t your problem to solve.

It doesn't matter if you think it's just dollar store junk, it's their stuff not yours and it's wrong to throw it out.", "YTA.  A HUGE one.  You have an incredible sense of entitlement for a freeloader.  You were given a roof over your head on your sister's grace, and you massively overstepped by taking it upon yourself to judge which of her belongings were worthy of being kept. Cleaning up and disposing of actual trash is one thing, but throwing away her actual clothes, shoes, belongings is beyond the pale.  Who the hell do you think you are?  \n\n\"In my opinion\" means absolute zero when you weren't asked. You're lucky your sister doesn't kick your ass out. Apologise and keep your hands to yourself and out of her belongings.", "YTA you're not doing anyone a favor but yourself.

I understand wanting to clean up the mess, but those aren't your things to throw away. Her messiness could be a symptom of an underlying mental issue like ADHD, depression, or hoarding. It would have been better if you pulled her to clean her stuff together and help her sort through what needs to be thrown away and what she can keep. People like that have an organized mess, meaning it's cluttered, but they know where everything is.\n\nI saw in one of your responses that she wouldn't miss a shirt that's been buried for months, but as someone with the same issue, she probably did miss it and just couldn't find it. I do that all the time. I still can't find a hat I lost.", "YTA They were kind and let you move into a place rent free and you immediately started throwing away their stuff. You knew they would hate that--that's why you hid the fact you were doing it and lied about it. So you know you're the asshole here.", "YTA, just shove the stuff under her bed and make it a her issue. You threw away property (clothes, shoes and jewellery) that weren't yours.", "YTA\nWow. They let you move in FOR FREE when you were homeless. And you treat their home as if nothing is of value. Just because YOU don't care, that doesn't erase other people's feelings about their home and belongings.\n\nYou are a liar, a thief, and a gaslighting bully to the people who lifted you up.\nFor shame.", "Oy. I dunno man. I get where you're coming from. I guess now is the time to actually have a Good and Trash box from now on, for appearances. You shouldn't be throwing away good stuff... but if the visual I have is accurate (hoarding) I get why you're doing what you're doing.\n\nJust stop being malicious. You already got kicked out of one place. Free rent? That's nothing to sneeze at. Focus on cleaning and dump her crap in her room from now on.\n\nCan't give judgement because not sure how bad it really is", "YTAAAAA", "You thought you were helping a hoarder.  Oops. Sorry you are living in that situation.  I hope you stay healthy and find a better situation.  \n\nI'm just going to skip the judgment because its obvious.", "I don't know what your childhood was like, but it sounds like she may have hoarding issues. This tends to get worse when well meaning people step in and 'help'. Therapy and tonnnnnes of patience is the way. Work on assisting her in organizing and cleaning, where and what she wants. Be prepared for allot of frustration tho....\nGoing with NAH, if it's hoarding OCD, it's a mental illness..... And FECK some of us just need CLEAN!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
