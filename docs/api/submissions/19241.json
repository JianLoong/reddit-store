My sister (24F) is living at her friends house and says they are cool with me crashing for the summer. I only need about three months anyways. When I show up the place is a MESS and even worse the room I was suppose to take is a dump ground for my sisters stuff. The kitchen is cluttered and disgusting. The bathroom is cluttered, moldy, and stinky. I decided to stay anyways because hey free rent. Over the course of the past month I have been cleaning and decluttering everywhere I could. I cant believe her friend puts up with her actually I can she is also responsible for the mess. I have thrown away countless cups, plates, canned food, candy, pasta, coffee, tea, hair accessories, cheap rings, sandals, Tupperware, trash, clothes, hats, countless socks etc. I know it sounds like this stuff could have been donated but all of her clutter comes from cheap dollar stores. They both love having me as a roommate because they think I am handy. I am. \n\nSlowly my sister has been noticing her stuff missing. She has questioned me and even called me asking if I have seen her shoes or whatever. I just deny seeing it and say I only throw away expired food, duplicates, or broken stuff. I am able to get away with throwing stuff out because I only do it on trash day. lol. Yesterday I messed up though because I forgot it wasn't trash day. I had filled the trashcan with a bunch of my sisters clothes and I was to lazy to take the trash out. She rarely uses the kitchen trashcan anyways since she doesn't clean up after herself. I was wrong and she noticed. I came home to an emptied out kitchen trashcan in the middle of the kitchen and she demanded I explain my self. I simply said that I had a \"trash box\" and a \"good box\" and that I emptied out the wrong box while I was decluttering the laundry room. She didn't buy it. I am doing her a favor and her friend a favor but they just don't see it. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Okay people I am the asshole. After reading many comments and arguing with yall I see it now. I still need time to think about what to do next but I for sure need to apologize and offer to replace everything.\n\nWhat I have learned:\n-I was essentially stealing\n-They didn't ask for my help\n-My actions make hoarding worse (not sure if its full on hoarding but i am not helping)\n-They are doing me a massive favor not the other way around\n-I am a guest\n\nDetail I left out: \n-I have no job.\n-I got kicked out of last apartment because landlord wanted her daughter to move in closer to her\n-I am sleeping on the couch because thats the only space available for the moment", "created_utc": 1686168000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143n956/aita_for_slowly_throwing_away_all_of_my_sisters/", "score": 2130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead you took it upon yourself to clear out stuff *you* didn't consider important without taking yr sister's feelings into consideration.\n\nEven worse, you lied about it! Yr sister noticed things missing. That was the time to come clean. Instead you denied even seeing the things that you were busily throwing away.\n\nIt wasn't your place to do that. You weren't doing anyone a \"favor.\" You were being a bit of a bully.\n\nAdmit what you did to your sister. Apologize. Offer to replace items you've thrown out.

I get where you are coming from in wanting to clean & declutter, but you are obviously throwing away things she uses. This also isn\u2019t going to teach her how to not be messy or over collect.

It doesn't matter if you think it's just dollar store junk, it's their stuff not yours and it's wrong to throw it out.", "YTA.  A HUGE one.  You have an incredible sense of entitlement for a freeloader.  You were given a roof over your head on your sister's grace, and you massively overstepped by taking it upon yourself to judge which of her belongings were worthy of being kept. Cleaning up and disposing of actual trash is one thing, but throwing away her actual clothes, shoes, belongings is beyond the pale.  Who the hell do you think you are?  \n\n\"In my opinion\" means absolute zero when you weren't asked. You're lucky your sister doesn't kick your ass out. Apologise and keep your hands to yourself and out of her belongings.", "YTA you're not doing anyone a favor but yourself.

I understand wanting to clean up the mess, but those aren't your things to throw away. Her messiness could be a symptom of an underlying mental issue like ADHD, depression, or hoarding. It would have been better if you pulled her to clean her stuff together and help her sort through what needs to be thrown away and what she can keep. People like that have an organized mess, meaning it's cluttered, but they know where everything is.\n\nI saw in one of your responses that she wouldn't miss a shirt that's been buried for months, but as someone with the same issue, she probably did miss it and just couldn't find it. I do that all the time. I still can't find a hat I lost.", "YTA They were kind and let you move into a place rent free and you immediately started throwing away their stuff. You knew they would hate that--that's why you hid the fact you were doing it and lied about it. So you know you're the asshole here.", "YTA, just shove the stuff under her bed and make it a her issue. You threw away property (clothes, shoes and jewellery) that weren't yours.", "YTA\nWow. They let you move in FOR FREE when you were homeless. And you treat their home as if nothing is of value. Just because YOU don't care, that doesn't erase other people's feelings about their home and belongings.\n\nYou are a liar, a thief, and a gaslighting bully to the people who lifted you up.\nFor shame.", "Oy. I dunno man. I get where you're coming from. I guess now is the time to actually have a Good and Trash box from now on, for appearances. You shouldn't be throwing away good stuff... but if the visual I have is accurate (hoarding) I get why you're doing what you're doing.\n\nJust stop being malicious. You already got kicked out of one place. Free rent? That's nothing to sneeze at. Focus on cleaning and dump her crap in her room from now on.\n\nCan't give judgement because not sure how bad it really is", "YTAAAAA", "You thought you were helping a hoarder.  Oops. Sorry you are living in that situation.  I hope you stay healthy and find a better situation.  \n\nI'm just going to skip the judgment because its obvious.", "I don't know what your childhood was like, but it sounds like she may have hoarding issues. This tends to get worse when well meaning people step in and 'help'. Therapy and tonnnnnes of patience is the way. Work on assisting her in organizing and cleaning, where and what she wants. Be prepared for allot of frustration tho....\nGoing with NAH, if it's hoarding OCD, it's a mental illness..... And FECK some of us just need CLEAN!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they don\u2019t see it as a favor, it\u2019s not a favor. \n\nOP, YTA. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Bingo", "Nailed it in one sentence. Perfect judgment.", "Well they\u2019re the same people that think showering twice daily is outrageous", "We don\u2019t know this was a hoarding situation though. Could just be a case of dirty girls, which I went through a phase like that in my early 20s. I ended up stepping on an avocado peel from one of my roommates at the time and that put and end to that phase. We were three young women sharing a space and treated it like one giant slumber party. I\u2019m sure our house was disgusting to outsiders.", "Nope. She noticed because you've been seriously overstepping. Throwing out mouldy food and takeaway cartons, fine. Throwing out actual crockery and clothing? Wtf, dude.\n\nYou sound weirdly vindictive towards someone who is doing you a massive favour. Like, no-one thinks throwing someone else's clothing in the literal bin counts as 'cleaning' or 'helping' in any way. And then you left it there for her to find? Sounds like you wanted to force a confrontation over your AH behaviour. You would be out of my house for this, brother or no brother.", "Asshole but \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 you sound unrepentant and tbh I\u2019m here for it", "The audacity of someone else taking your stuff without asking! Imagine that! Oh wait, you already did it.", "Did you ask? At any point, *did you ask her* if she still wanted those shoes you threw away, that she asked you about later?", "How do you even know which clothes are buried under clothes for months?", "Bro my fianc\u00e9 throws out my broken shit that I refuse to throw away all the time and I love him for it. Some people just have a really hard time parting with things and someone else doing it makes it actually happen.", "I'm talking about ACTUAL Tupperware. If OP means the cheap \"not Tupperware\" that isn't even worth owning in the first place.  I 100% agree on the cheap storage containers. They're flimsy, stain, get warped and the lids are not at all secure (even less so once warped). It's pretty much toast after a single use. I don't own any; Tupperware or glass only.", "Living in a shithole might not be fun, but the point is that it's not *his* shithole, and unless they ask him to help change it he has no right to. If he really doesn't like it, he can always go sleep on the streets.", "He is throwing out stuff they use. They let him stay for free. They didn't ask him to clean or throw their stuff out. When they ask him he lies and lets them go looking for things he knows he threw out. How is that contributing?\n\nWhen you do something for someone and they didn't want it done. That doesn't count as contribute or help.\n\nA guest has no right to start throwing your stuff out.\n\nIt's not for you or him to decide if they have too many clothes that they paid for in their own home.\n\nHe isn't doing it to help them he is doing it because he doesn't like it. He says his sister needs to get her life together yet he is the one that is relying on his younger sister for free housing. She has a job and a house and he has neither. \n\nI became friends with a guy who was homeless. I let him stay at my house and he decided to rearrange things as he preferred and threw some of my stuff out. At least he didn't lie to me about it. But he quickly became homeless again.\n\nCleaning, organizing, throwing out actual garbage and expired food is one thing. Even this if someone let me into their house for free I would ask for permission to clean and organize. Ask if I could contribute in that way or how they would like me to help.\n\nBut without being given permission or asked, to throw out dishes, clothes, shoes, hair stuff. Also maybe throwing out the stuff of someone you don't even know. Then straight up lie about it when they go looking. This is a whole new level of not ok.\n\nThe situation with you and your girlfriend is not really comparable.", "Yea, I got Tupperware from my mom, lasted a few years. I've got Dollar Tree bowls with covers that cost $1 each and I've had for 25 years. They even hold water! unlike Tupperware. And don't stain unlike Tupperware... Oh, and I got some more Tupperware at some point. They're junk. Sorry to the donation places.\n\nDo you sell it or something? cause reality is not strong with your post.\n\nMy husband has tortured his containers for work lunches (works outside) and microwave even tho they are \"microwave safe\". That is what you describe which isn't at all normal containers you can get... just the super cheapy ones.", "You're as clean as you pretend to be here and are: 1) unemployed, 2) homeless, 3) a thief. So how's all that working for you? YTA", "No, don't sell Tupperware though my mother did in the 70's and 80's. She still has some and has passed some on to me. 40+ years and still going strong. Don't know what was wrong with your Tupperware because all of mine hold liquids. Have one that's my fav for holding large amounts of leftover soup and another for whisking large amounts of liquids. All of the pieces my mother has that have lids still seal tight as a drum. Can actually be difficult to get the lidd off sometimes. What era was your mother's Tupperware from? Because the newer stuff is nowhere near the quality of the old. I won't buy the new stuff.", "Chill. I get it some Tupperware was worth the money. on the other hand folks could just pay $1 for something equally good as the Tupperware. So why get the Tupperware aside from the goofy parties?\n\nOh and for your last question of when my mom got her Tupperware, I dunno but I'm late 40s and she had it all by the time I was about 10. I can remember the goofy Tupperware parties and such. She had a couple different sets of stuff, you know when they changed colors when I was a kid, I'm sure with your knowledge you know more about that than I.", "Oh FFS.", "... ? I am assuming you understood the words but not sure why you are upset about my comment?"]}
