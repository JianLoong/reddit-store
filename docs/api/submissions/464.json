You are also being extremely sensitive about all swearing and that\u2019s obnoxious too. They\u2019re just words, relax. Your dad is the AH for breeding staffies, which should be illegal.

If I could\u2019ve gotten a Newfoundland rescue, I would\u2019ve (and I did try). I knew with certainty that a Newfoundland was the dog for me. I couldn\u2019t have been more right and the beautiful variety of dog breeds that exist make that true for many people. There is a dog for every lifestyle. I want that to continue to be the case and those breeds should exist. \n\nHowever, I searched for over a year for a responsible breeder and was highly selective. It shouldn\u2019t have to be that way. The *only* people that should be breeding dogs should be vetted throughly and meet qualifications. You don\u2019t have a right to breed a non-human animal. That\u2019s not a human right. \n\nSadly, some breeds also just shouldn\u2019t continue to be created, and staffies/pits are one of them. Pugs and bulldogs are another. The truth is that most people aren\u2019t equipped for a pit bull (or similar) dog, in part because of their strength, but also their energy levels. There are already too many and there will never be enough homes that can accommodate them all. It\u2019s time to honestly start fining people stupid amounts for creating bully breed dogs. I would honestly support a $15,000 fine for the breeding of a bully litter. That\u2019s way more than they\u2019d make off of the puppies and would hopefully deter it.", "I honestly don't care.

How do you justify people who just let their dog breed at random on accident with no way to actually look after the dogs, no genetic tests and often sell them to anyone in the neighborhood? You can't. It's in many ways even worse. So is dog ownership itself ethical?

The vast majority of the time when you hear that word you are assuming an insult to women. It has all but ceased to be relevant when discussing dog breeding and I don\u2019t think that can be reasonably disputed. There are many other words that have undergone similar changes over time and become inappropriate with our changing language. This is just another one. The F word to mean cigarette has been falling out of favor for the same reason for some time. It\u2019s certainly a process and you\u2019ll still hear it occasionally, but it is being phased out. The same is true of this word. It is slowly being replaced with \u201cdam\u201d because common connotation is as a slur.
