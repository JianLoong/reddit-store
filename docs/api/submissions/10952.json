Also, if your niece is uncomfortable about sharing with her male cousin, she shouldn't be forced to. It sounds as though this house is treated as a free for all with no boundaries or thought for dynamics, and it inevitably leads to arguments. \n\nSince you did up the basement with your money, I think you do have some sway in this and should be saying 'no more than two people down here, because that's the number of beds.'", "Your niece has her own home and she still needs a room with you? \n\n\n\nSorry, but if your other brother fell on hard times and needs help, than the second place for the niece is really not a priority in my opinion.

You move out and let them figure this giant mess out. This is not hard at all. Nephew gets the basement. Bro & wife gets the second bedroom.
