When you say that you don't want to share a bedroom, your partner may be interpreting that as you deliberately creating distance between the two of you. I'm sure that's not your intention but it may help you understand her reaction.\n\nIgnoring this particular issue to speak in general; you should make sure that you two can agree on shared and individual spaces before you move in together. That doesn't mean that you have to share everything, of course - but think about why you want a separate bedroom.\n\nIf you want a quiet space to be on your own, work/read/etc - maybe you could carve out some space to be your office? If you have different schedules and are worried about logistics of getting dressed/ready/etc, you could do separate bathrooms or put a second dresser for your clothes in another room. It sounds like you need your own space, but you might be able to achieve this while still sharing a bedroom.\n\nAnyways, I don't think anyone here has enough context to say that you and your partner are incompatible, so I wouldn't immediately jump to that conclusion. It's normal and healthy to have conversations like this before you move in with someone. \n\nIf you're not planning to move in right away, I would defuse the situation and think on it some more. Explain to your partner that your past experience was different, so you didn't realize that this would seem weird to them. It seems like you're honestly considering their need to share a bedroom.

'Normal' is a word to describe essentially the average or, of I'm being really mathematical - the mode, the most frequent occurrences. When we apply \"normal\" to people or behavior/preferences, it carries a lot of negative emotions, or negative connotations.  \n\nSleeping habits are varied - ie everyone sleeps in one large room, vs all females in one room and all males  in another. Like race and gender roles, they are all cultural constructs. At one time, it was safer for everyone to sleep in one room, or separate by sex. They have so also been dictated by economics - 5 people living in a studio apartment, or only having enough resources to pay for a certain kind of abode. Yurts only have one room. Tipi's are one big room. School dormitories are frequently split by gender.  \n\n I've had partners that I've thought about smothering with a pillow... and I'm sure my partners haven't been happy with restless leg syndrome, snoring (in allergy season), and i am told i turn into a furnace when i am asleep -  which is great in the cold weather but not so much in any warm season. \n\nTalking is important, the vocabulary we use, and if we are trying to understand the other party all can make a situation sound worse then it is, or like making an inferno out of a candle. \n\nOP - don't let her make you feel less because you have different ideas, ideals, and experiences than her. Difference can be the spice of life, if you are open and positive about it. \n\nPlease take everyone's advice of talking about this with her, because this one difference is rooted in expectations and maturity. You have different expectations for personal space and sleeping arrangements. Are your goals the same in this relationship? Are you really comfortable moving in with her? Are you in love and want to share daily activities face-to-face or are you (plural) just moving in together because this seems like a good time for it, or maybe you (singular) believe that it's been the right amount of time being a couple so now you are supposed to live together? \n\nConsiderations and conversations need to happen.

For someone for whom separate bedrooms would be a sign of problems in the relationship at best and more accurately a dead relationship, it\u2019s impossible to pair off with somebody who wants to have separate rooms.\n\nSometimes when I hear the pro separate room people talk about how they are so insulted that anyone thinks it\u2019s unusual that they want a separate room, it makes me wonder if they truly grasp how many people **do** mean it as a rejection when they move into a separate room. I think that people\u2019s perspectives on this issue are shaped by how moving into a separate room has been done in their lives. When my husband moved into a separate bedroom in his previous marriage, he did it because he was done with the relationship. So if he tried that on me, I would be devastated. But if during our getting to know you stage he had told me all about how he\u2019s always had his own room and he really likes his alone time and blah blah blah, I wouldn\u2019t take it as an insult if it happened. I would miss him terribly, because to me, sharing sleep with a partner is extremely important. It\u2019s one of the biggest benefits of having a partner, for me anyway. But I wouldn\u2019t presume I was being rejected. But since we\u2019ve talked, and he\u2019s told me that was what it meant for him in the past, I would definitely take it as being rejected if he did that to me.\n\n\nEdited for: a million talk to text typos.", "True that not everything can be a compromise but IMO we can't conclude that here. We simply don't have enough info. \"Sharing a bedroom\" is vague. For example, many couples sleep in the same room but have different bathrooms. So what aspects are important to OP's partner?\n\nEven if sharing a bedroom is non-negotiable for the partner, the OP seems willing to accept this. From the OP's post it seems like they care more about having their own space than having a particular issue with sharing a bed. So maybe they share a bedroom bedroom but the partner makes a compromise elsewhere.\n\nAnyways, occasionally in a relationship, compromise is capitulation. It's not a zero sum game; and it's okay if you realize that an issue is way more important to your partner and decide to put them first.", "They're saying the first person should have ideally said \"unconventional\" instead of \"not normal\" \n\nA convention doesn't have to be the norm, since \"normal\" usually implies some level of conformity rather than a choice.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Plus a cold, wet nose to the taint is one hella mood killer.", "Both our cats only love my husband; he sleeps with both and I get nothing :(", "A lot to unpack here, but to stay on topic, I am not seeing why what you are describing requires a specific sex bedroom, instead if \u201conly\u201d one bedroom for each of you.", "My ex wife has RLS, and snores something horrible.

He had apnea and an appliance, but he had no idea he had AFib until I noticed it.\n\nHis symptoms were exactly what you describe.

It took a few minutes of convincing, but he made a Dr appointment and got the confirmation. He had a surgical procedure (ablation) to correct it and he's been great ever since.\n\nUntreated AFib can lead to strokes in some cases. Please, have him see a doctor.", "Me too.

I don't think that necessarily invalidates how people feel though. \n\nAs you said, separate bedrooms are commonly associated with failing marriages. It seems like a normal reaction to be concerned about your relationship if there's an aspect of it that is commonly associated with unhealthy relationships. There is often a lot of uncertainty and anxiety when you move in with a new partner, especially if you're younger. When someone tells you that they don't want something that you took for granted as intrinsic to a relationship, it naturally raises concerns.\n\nSo, I don't know if it's relevant whether or not people have a good argument, because it's not an argument. Occasionally, you just want something and there's not a clear reason.\n\nHaving said all that, it would be helpful to at least talk about the potential reasons with OP's partner- ie: what do you like about sharing a bedroom with me?

I think that's pretty normal but it doesn't have to be the bedroom, lots of people have an office/etc\n\nAlternatively, if OP wants to keep their lives separate in general then - yeah that's bound to fail. You deserve space to yourself but the reality of building a life together with someone is that you may occasionally have to share more than you have historically been comfortable with."]}
