The two of you have to somewhat be on the same page when it comes to things like this. This is something that needs a full discussion and either a compromise is made or you don't move in together. There also needs to be some discussion over things like if you have kids. If you do maintain separate rooms which room would the newborns be in and why? Would you temporarily share a room? How does intimacy work? And so on.", "NAH this is a compatibility issue.", "NAH. Just as separate rooms are your normal - shared bedrooms are hers. You guys need to sit down and have a good talk about this as it sounds like it might be a deal breaker for her.\n\nDo you think it is something you could let go of? Or do you see a compromise between you two that you might reach?", "NTA but you might not just be compatible with this. We have separate bed rooms (after a trial run without and split time on the couch) My SO snores like a low flying helicopter, thrashes around till all the covers are in a knot and JFC the *sprawl*! I have sleep anxiety (not from SO) and insomnia, and essentially get out of the bed in the morning and it looks already made. \n\nCuddling and sexy fun time happens any/every where. We both get a decent nights sleep... And I have avoided jail time since all I thought about when we were in the same bed was how I could end the noise and sprawl *forever*......", "NTA... it is how you grew up. It is your normal. Sleeping together is her normal. \n\nYou two are just different. That's all. There is nothing to be an AH about. You two are going to have to find a compromise. You might want to try it her way. Spooning is a fantastic way to drift off to sleep.", "My brother and his wife maintain separate bedrooms - he wants a space that's all his own, and she says that things get more exciting when she visits a man's territory for a while.  They still sleep together, oh, 4 nights out of 7, but that's about all of the snoring she can handle.  They're one of the happiest married couples I know, partly because they didn't completely lose themselves in their marriage.  It's not like it was back in the day!  My vote - NTA.", "NTA if it works for you then cool.  \n\n\nWhen we retire, my husband knows I will have a separate sleeping space because we are absolute polar opposites in what we want/need to relax and sleep properly.  Doesn't mean we love each other any less, it's just the way we are built.", "NAH you just want different things.", "NAH. I can understand from both points of view, and truly think it is a preference/norm. I would personally not be okay with my s/o not wanting to share a bed with me, but I can't blame you for wanting your space. No one is the asshole here, I think it's just a matter of preferences and compromises. This is all a factor of finding your lifelong partner. If the bedroom is her hill to die on perhaps compromise on some alone time on the weekend or find another solution.", "NtA.

Good luck sorting through that. \n\nNAH", "NTA it is becoming more common. People are even building homes with two master bedrooms these days if they can afford it.

For many people separate bedrooms are usually a sign of lack of interest, less intimacy and a certain emotional distance. A bit like living with a roommate instead with a significant other.", "NAH. It's not normal, but you are not TA for wanting it. I am confused as to why you would want to live together if you don't want to share a bed.", "It\u2019s a good thing you told her before she moved in. NTA but be prepared for most partners to want to share a bedroom. I\u2019ve actually never known any couple to have separate rooms, even the old ones.", "Most couples I know that have separate rooms is because for one of two reasons: snoring or flailing. In my opinion, you're NTA, but you should try sharing a bed before deciding on separate rooms.", "NTA, but you two need to start communicating and experimenting.\n\nHave you two ever had sleepovers at the other's place?  I am surprised this subject did not come up well before you two became serious.", "NTA. So many sleeping disorders can be avoided by sleeping separately! And no, it's not just \"old couples\" that have separate bedrooms; there are more people than you think that have them. \n\nI didn't go \"NAH\" because yr GF's attitude seems strange; to say it \"isn't normal\" is harsh, and sounds like she's trying to make you feel bad.\n\nIf sleeping separately is comfortable for you, great. Of course, you'll have to find someone that feels the same way. And evidently your GF doesn't.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re moving in together doesn\u2019t mean you have to sleep in the same bed. It\u2019s a boundary and you\u2019re allowed to set it, especially when that was the norm for you growing up. I would talk it out, and maybe see if you can have your own separate rooms, but sometimes sleep together (to keep both sides happy). (PS. As a very bad sleeper, I would be super nervous to share a bed with someone constantly all of a sudden. My sleep and stress levels would be severely impacted)", "INFO:   How often do you sleep together now?   Do you have any sleep disorders that would indicate you should sleep separately?\n\nWhy can't you have your own space and still sleep in the same room?", "NTA  My partner and I have been together for 30 years and I swear part of the reason why is the separate bedrooms.  It's not just sleeping better (we both have some sleep issues) but it also allows a small space in the home where it's yours.  It allows you to keep a small bit of your individual preference and identity. We still join each other for fun times or just to hang out in bed but understand it's that person's space. And, our cats love it!", "NAH.  I\u2019m single, and I probably would have been a lot happier in past relationships if I had my own bedroom.  There is nothing wrong with sharing a bed or having your own space, it comes down to personal preference.  I\u2019m pretty sure my parents would be divorced if my mom didn\u2019t request her own bedroom 20 years ago.  I suggest you both sit down and have a candid conversation about why your individual preferences are important to you and see if you can find a compromise that will work.  Good luck.", "NTA but it sounds like this is going to be a big stressor on this relationship.   She's made it pretty clear she's probably not going to move in with you now.", "NTA, but I would be weirded out if my partner wanted to be in a separate room and I personally wouldn\u2019t be okay with it.

Ideally living totally separate, but I\u2019d be ok with separate rooms.", "NAH, but this is a big stop and consider.\n\nThis is a big miss on intimacy and expectations surrounding it.

In my last relationship where I lived with the person, I had my own bedroom. We would mostly always start out sleeping in our shared room (his room I guess) but when the obnoxious snoring started... I was out. Sleeping together is a relatively newer thing for the modern world. Two beds were pushed together, brooms as separators, etc. Quality of sleep is the goal.", "NTA, and I only know folks who do this because one of them snores louder than a 747, or one of them does shift work and they sleep opposite times (though those couples sleep together on nights off).\n\nIf my SO wanted to do that from the outset purely because they wanted space, I\u2019d rethink the relationship.

I\u2019d be devastated though not sleeping in the same bed, never mind the same room as my husband. It\u2019s a huge part of our intimacy sharing that space. Are you compatible libido wise? Separate rooms kinda shuts off more spontaneous sex.", "It's not uncommon to have separate rooms. I toss and turn all night.  I have sleep apnea, though I sleep with a CPAP.  And I have restless leg syndrome. Plus I prefer the room to be about arctic temperatures when I'm sleeping. He's pretty much the opposite.", "I think that some couples can happily sleep in separate rooms and others cannot. My fianc\u00e9 and I wouldn\u2019t ever be happy in separate rooms. I feel like if it\u2019s for a valid reason, like you or they snore and keep the other person awake all night for example, that\u2019s not a big deal. If you are just not wanting to be around them and feel like you desperately need space to be away from them, you probably shouldn\u2019t be a couple. But, if you can\u2019t come to a happy agreement and one or both of you compromise I would definitely be reevaluating the relationship", "NTA at all. My husband snores like the sound of an apache helicopter and I have serious multiple chronic health conditions which require some level of sleep to manage, and therefore we both have separate rooms. We also spend most of our time at home (hybrid working and not being outdoorsy) so it's good to have some space to do our own thing (he loves gaming, I love napping and watching videos online). We also get creative license on decorating our rooms (he is minimalistic and I'm a lilac and unicorn lover). We are both happy in our marriage and it actually has made our relationship stronger as we can take care of our individial needs and appreciate each other's company more in the communal areas of the house.\n\nIf you think about it... when we are asleep, we are asleep. We aren't able to talk to one another, and most of the time cuddling happens before sleeping and people tend to roll over and face the other way to sleep. So, you're not really spending time together in that regard anyway. It makes sense to cuddle and have... intimate times... together when awake then do your own thing when sleeping.", "To her you are.

When I lived with my ex I slept in our bed maybe 50% of the time. The rest of the time I was on the couch. Why? I suffer from insomnia and sometimes I'm just tossing and turning for hours. I also prefer having noise, like a tv-show or something, on when trying to sleep. She needed complete silence.

I\u2019m disabled & sleep badly, my husband sleeps well. I used to worry in a double, or even a king that my thrashing about at night would disturb him. Now we have a zip linked super king & separate duvets so I feel I have my fidget space but also if I cry in the night (which is fairly often cos of pain) he\u2019s there to comfort me, we have loads of in bed conversations.

Not specifically to abusers **at all.** You can\u2019t make silly shit up just because you want to and not expect to get called on it.", "But why though? Whats your reason?\n\nI've frankly never heard a good argument against sharing rooms (except if you can't afford the space, I guess). People who get uptight about this idea just sound insecure because seperate rooms are associated wjth failing marriages.", "Dear spouse snores like a motorcycle, piles on the covers, and likes complete silence. I like a ticking clock and only a light blanket. We have separate rooms,  and liberal visiting privileges (I hope that I may appropriate that term).", "Physical contact and intimacy is more important to some people.  My spouse and I are touching in some way pretty much all night.  We\u2019re both happy with it and it works for us.\n\nOur bed is where we talk and relax.
