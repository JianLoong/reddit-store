It will 32 yrs this month and we still happily don't share a bedroom for sleeping.  There's NAH, people have different needs.  Take the time to decide whether this is a dealbreaker or something you can give up or figure out some compromise that works for both of you.  Does your partner want snuggles every night?  You can do that in one room/bed or the other before sleeping.  Or maybe it's the waking up together they need and you can do this 3 or 4 nights a week?

We sometimes sleep in the bed together on weekends and obviously when we're on vacation together and then I'm always wearing earplugs and try to fall asleep before him. But yeah, separate sleeping places definitely helped to keep our relationship alive. I don't know what I would have done if he insisted on keeping to sleep together.", "I haven\u2019t talked to my SO but i would consider it if we ever build a house. I apparently snore loudly. He\u2019s a night owl and I\u2019m an early bird. I like a cool temperature but he likes it warmer. I just think we would both sleep better.", "Man you ever watch Scrubs? There\u2019s an episode where they talk about this idea and it hits me like a truck all the time \u201cshe\u2019s a terrible snorer, used to keep me up. I made her get the surgery now when she\u2019s out of town I can\u2019t fall asleep\u201d we both snore like lawnmowers and sometimes when my wife isn\u2019t in the bed I\u2019ll hear a snore and roll over to tell my wife to move a little but she isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s become a strange white noise", "Is this about OP not wanting to sleep together, or just wanting their own space? Ex and I had separate offices/hobby rooms that doubled as guest rooms, and got us both the space we needed.", ". . . because he wants to share a life and a household with her? And he DOES want to share a bed with her in the carnal sense, just not necessarily fall asleep together every night. He wants them each to have their own personal space. That doesn't mean they'll NEVER sleep together.", "Is this about OP not wanting to sleep together, or just wanting their own space? Ex and I had separate offices/hobby rooms that doubled as guest rooms, and got us both the space we needed.", "I love sharing a bed with my bf but occasionally we have to do separate rooms. its a huge part of intimacy for sure but there\u2019s way more to living together than just sharing a bed.", "Sharing a bed isn\u2019t the only reason to want to live with an SO.", "I do not think that's weird at all, lol. I'm aroace to be fair but even if I wasn't, i couldn't imagine wanting another person in my bed while I'm trying to sleep", "I think not sharing room does not mean sharing bed every night. \nMe and my gf agree on having different rooms if one day we would move together so each one would have their own spaces, but at the same time sleeping together every night like a little sleepover \nI think that\u2019s the best way", "They haven't moved in together though... it's a hypothetical at this point...", "You should try actually reading the post, they haven't moved in yet", "Good for him and you.  Sleep apnea is so under diagnosed and has far serious consequences than keeping people awake with your snoring.   \nIf anyone tells you that you have a snoring issue, go for sleep test", "No, but she's a bit of an AH for shaming him, telling him it's \"absurd\" and \"not normal\". She doesn't have to want this for herself, but her aggressively cruel reaction to him about it, particularly given that it's what he grew up with, makes her a bit of an AH. Shaming harmless things just because they're not what you're used to pretty much always makes you an AH.", "This is almost the exact same for my partner and I. Separate bedrooms just work.", "I mean, it could be that it's just *actually very important* for OP's gf to share a bed and room with her partner.... she's allowed to be unhappy with his need for a different room and he's allowed to be unhappy with her need for the same room... not everything can always be a compromise.", "I think they're saying that sleeping in the same bed as your partner is not normal. Weird take, but unless they omitted a word or something that seems to be their opinion.", "with my compliments", "When you say good argument you\u2019re just saying it doesn\u2019t align with how you feel. Not that it\u2019s a bad argument. It has nothing to do with insecurity. Many people like the shared intimacy of sleeping beside their SO.", "I never sleep well when my husband and I are apart. I would just not be comfortable in separate rooms at all. It would feel lonely to me. Also, most of our sex is spontaneous, not planned, and it usually happens when we are in bed together. If you are sleeping separately, sex is initiated in a very different way or must be planned, and both people have to be comfortable with that. While I would consider trying it if my husband asked for it, I\u2019d be very sad and I\u2019m not sure it would work. But this is still an early relationship with little serious investment. OP and their partner are both perfectly reasonable in standing their ground on what they want. This would absolutely be a deal breaker for me this early in a relationship, where the relationship is still potentially expendable for sure.\n\nNAH. But I do agree with the majority of posters that this is a major compatibility issue.", "Lol yeah that\u2019s a very strange take haha.", "i like the shared intimacy of sleeping beside my SO too. But I'm a night owl, she likes tp get up at 6 a.m. on weekends. we have digferent work schedules. she snores, i flail. We both like our space. Seperate rooms means ee can sleep beside each other some nights and not others. It actually makes the nights when we *do* sleep beside each other feel more special. \n\nSeperate rooms and intimacy are not a binary.", "Right but that\u2019s for you.  That doesn\u2019t mean it works for everyone.  For some people intimacy and separate rooms don\u2019t work.\n\nFrom Ops girlfriends perspective it\u2019s probably extra hard to accept because there isn\u2019t a reason.  Op didn\u2019t mention snoring or flailing or different schedules.  He literally just wants space away from her. Plenty of people would be not good with that."]}
