I was just buying a new mattress and the salesman was saying just how typical it was for spouses to have their own beds, if not their own rooms. Much more common that you'd think. It's about comfort and sleep quality.", "It works out. For example, I slip into bed with my husband to read and snuggle for half an hour each night. He's the type who can roll over and be snoring in 20 seconds, but I'm a night owl. So then I go to my bed and get comfy or take care of some last minute chores after our snuggle.", "I (48F) have never been married, but I lived with one of my ex bfs for 7 years. I need total dark, silence and to be alone in bed if I want to sleep well. Also I hated to sleep in the same bed as my ex if we had a fight or something. I would never share a bed with another person ever again. It has nothing to do with love.", "This wouldn't work at my house unless there were dogs for everyone", "A 3 bedroom apartment with 1 room for each, and a shared one, is basically the childfree lifestyle.\n\nPicking a new city whenever you get bored of your current one.", "My husband was super happy when I got mine \ud83e\udd23 I was too. Best sleep ever", "Being able to afford surplus bedrooms in current economy may not be very common though.", "I think people are saying they are incompatible because for them (and a lot of people, myself included) there is no compromise to this. It would be an absolute line in the sand deal breaker. \n\nSure the OP should speak to the partner and try and work out if a compromise can be reached. Of course they should rather than just throw the relationship away. But they should be prepared for the very real possibility that there is no acceptable compromise and it is a basic incompatibility", "If I'm going to sleep separately except once a week,  I might as well have separate girlfriends.\n\nEveryone has different expectations for a committed relationship.", "That's the way it works for us. We've had many cats over the years and they each seem to stake out their favorite person and bed.  Rarely have they all chosen to be with one person together.", "Fine! The dog can decide where he wants to sleep. Just not the sexy room because he's too young and innocent to be exposed that sort of stuff.", "Yeah, no dog for me and i would be out of the door! Lol", "+1 vote for sleep tests and CPAPs for everyone! In fact i would say if your insurance covers it go ahead and have a sleep test done even if you *don't* have a snoring problem! I don't snore, but i did have a spike in my blood pressure that could not be explained by a wide range of tests. Got a sleep study done and it tuned out that i stopped breathing *22 times* during the night! I had no idea! i wasn't tired, i didn't have any of the other symptoms of sleep apnea or general sleep deprivation, i had no clue. Since i got my machine (fully covered by even my basic insurance because it turns out it's cheaper to give people a CPAP than to treat them for worse shit down the line) i fall asleep faster and easier, and wake up with way more energy. Turns out i WAS tired, i just didn't know it because that was my normal! Also the blood pressure is now exactly where it should be! CPAPs!!!!", "50 ways to stay with your lover!", "This is the thing. It may be essential for one to share. My wife and I properly snuggle up most nights and I'm not sure I could do without that when trying to sleep.", "I feel like being stiff and rigid on this issue is itself a problem. How is it impossible to compromise on something like, say, sharing a bed three or four nights a week instead of all seven, or none? (assuming you can afford to have separate bedrooms). \n\nThis sounds like one of those areas where negotiation and compromise is especially important? If there are issues that are compromising someone's sleep (snoring, flailing, very different sleep schedules), that's a major health risk. Bad sleep quality exacerbates every health issue there is, and if you actually care about your partner, you should take that seriously.", "So you really only care about having a bed partner at all times, and not who that specific person is. They make really good quality anime body pillows now, look into those.", "Our sex life got better when we separated rooms. We ended up sexting each other and getting all worked up (sometimes for hours through texting) it\u2019s like intense foreplay. \nI know it\u2019s different for everyone, but it really amped up our sex life."]}
