Her parents don't approve of her partner and she's currently living with them to care for them. But since they don't approve of her boyfriend, they throw a fit whenever she goes out on her own. To avoid the drama, she asked me if I could pick her up at 7am.  I had an early morning shift that day and said that it's not possible. Then she asked if my brother(23M) could give her a ride instead. \n\nProblem is, I knew he wouldn't be willing. He finishes work at 12am, hits the gym, takes a shower and goes to bed by 2.30-3am. I asked him just for the sake of it and he agreed on the condition that I buy him breakfast. I informed my friend that my brother's willing and let her know that he is EXTREMELY punctual- 7am is when he'll be there, not a second later. \n\nWhen the day arrived, I called her at 6.45am to ensure she's up n ready. She did not answer the call. I kept calling her every 10-12 mins till 7.30am and gave up. My brother was already frustrated at this point and I asked him to go ahead with his day so he left to have breakfast with his girlfriend. My friend calls me at 7.45am saying she was in the bathtub and her phone was on vibrate so she couldn't answer my call. I asked her why she didn't let me know if she wasn't ready at 7 and replied that she had overslept, woken up at 6.30 and had been in the bathroom ever since having a spa day. And then she continued to say \"I'm ready now. Ask your brother to come pick me up\". I laughed n said that ain't happening, he already left for the day and will directly go to his office after his day out with his partner. She got angry at this and made a whole deal about how she'll have to explain to her parents about why my brother didn't come, where she's going etc. I said that's not my problem and cut the call. I understood her situation but her entitlement to my brother's time pissed me off. \n\nI was talking about this to my mom last evening and she said I should've asked my brother to wait longer since I knew how my friend's parents can get. In hindsight, I'm wondering if I was an AH for asking my brother to leave. He would've stayed had I asked but I was too caught up on how disrespectful my friend was being towards my brother.", "created_utc": 1684085722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hi8s3/aita_for_not_making_my_brother_give_a_ride_to_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shower and dress as quick as possible. And apologise profusely.", "NTA - your friend sounds extremely entitled, why doesn\u2019t her boyfriend pick her up nearby? Your brother had ZERO obligation, she\u2019s not even HIS friend. Personally her reasoning is astonishing to me, she was in the bath??? Whilst someone is waiting for her?? I\u2019m surprised at her AUDACITY to think she still can get her way.", "NTA \n\nYou can roll out of bed at 6.30 and be outside at 7AM.  I've done it MANY many times.  She just didn't care to.", "NTA and I wouldn't offer again. When you ask for a favor, be on time. If not, don't dare ask again.", "NTA. You told her to be ready at 7, and you even tried calling. I would have told him to leave too", "NTA.\n\nThere are rules for when receiving a favour\n\n1. Be on time.\n2. Be respectful.\n3. Don't complain when you mess it up.\n\nYour brother was doing a favour for you, she messed it up, then wanted him to go back for her.  Personally if I am giving a lift, I say a time, then I wait 5 mins, if your late and you haven't contacted me then I am going.  It is obvious your friend doesn't respect your brothers, his time, and what it cost him in fuel to go out of his way to pick her up.  Your mother should has it wrong.  Its not your brothers fault for your friends parents, and she is a complete AH here, for sneaking around.", "NTA. She's a grown adult acting like a teen by sneaking around behind her parent's backs. That by default makes her the asshole", "\"You asked me for a favor, which I literally couldn't do, so I went out on a limb *for you* and asked my brother to do it. I knew it was hugely inconvenient for him, and that he didn't want to do it, but I got him to agree to do it. And you absolutely *squandered* the opportunity. I told you being punctual was important (which I shouldn't have had to tell you, since again, this was a huge favor for you, you should have been doing everything within your power to make it as easy for the person doing the favor as possible). And even though I warned you, you were *still* so disrespectful of my efforts and my brother's time that you couldn't even be bothered to *pick up the phone* in a punctual way! And you are annoyed at me? You are incredibly ungrateful. Let's ignore the fact that you owe me an apology for making me look bad with my brother, and making it nearly impossible for me to ask him for future favors, you owe *my brother* a huge apology. And don't even think about asking me to help you with your parents again until you make things right with my brother.\"\n\nNTA. And feel free to tell your mom that she is welcome to help your friend deceive her parents. Hopefully your friend will respect your mother's time in a way that she refused to respect your brother's time and effort.", "NTA. I think we all know who the AH is in this story...", "NTA and I'm glad your brother didn't wait. I had a hard time reading past her \"spa day.\"", "NTA. Honestly she sounds entitled to me.", "NTA - Her fault, her problem.", "NTA by far! The entitlement is strong here. You emphasized the criticality of your friend being punctual. She didn't bother being ready 'til 45 minutes after the deadline. Said she overslept and apparently she's never heard of \"You snooze you lose\".\r  \n\r  \nYour brother was already doing a big favor for someone he didn't know. The two of you were totally right to continue with your normal day after your friend's failure.\r  \n\r  \nMore entitlement: this whole thing was precipitated by friend's parents. She's living there to take care of them, but they give her a hard enough time that she's sneaking out of her residence. She should grow a backbone and tell them to shut up about her private life or she's moving out.\r  \n\r  \nYour mom shouldn't be catering to friend's self-imposed living situation and shouldn't be blaming anyone else but your friend.", "Who \u2026 I had to read this 4x to understand.

After telling her that she\u2019d have to be ON TIME if she wanted a ride, she decided not to do something as simple as set a damn alarm to be up on time. Then, when she knew she was already running late, decided to have a \u2018spa day\u2019? He\u2019s your brother, not hers, and owes her nothing. She was 45 mins late. She needs to be a goddamn adult and be responsible for her time.", "Holy crap.  Is she 27 or 17??  This is some childish bullshit.
