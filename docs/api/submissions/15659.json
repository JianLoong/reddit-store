But the person giving birth gets to decide who is there immediately before, during, and while your body is still healing from giving birth. \n\nPeople seem to forget that babies don't just pop out of thin air because once they are born, all of the focus is on them. But that baby is coming out of your body one of two ways - neither is pleasant and both require significant healing time for you. \n\nPut the baby to one side for a second (figuratively of course) - if you had major surgery, would anyone think it is reasonable for your partner to invite guests to stay in your home without discussing it with you? No. Most reasonable people wouldn't even consider staying in your home in that situation unless they were specifically asked to come and help.", "NTA on the title alone.\n\n>My husband recently announced to me that MIL will arrive around that time too.

MIL could come after your mom leaves for a week and have her time then, when you are more comfortable caring for your baby.", "NTA  Your mom is coming to help take care of you & support you & baby.  MIL is coming because...?  She has no function other than wanting to hang out with her son's new baby.  As she doesn't have a close, intimate relationship with you, you and her son will be caring for your baby, and your mom will be caring for you, ask your spouse why she is coming at that time.  It sounds like she is in a competition with your mom.  Request that she come a few weeks after baby is born & you are physically back on your feet & in a routine with your baby.  Too many people in the house can stress out a pregnant woman, delaying birth and creating a dangerous situation, and can also stress a new mom, making bfing much more challenging.  If she says she's there to support her son, then again she can come after baby is born as he isn't birthing anyone and you'll have immediate assistance with baby.", "NTA.  Talk to your husband about your concerns.  If MIL wants to visit, she can stay at a hotel and come by when you agree to her company.", "NTA - You need to be comfortable to give birth and in a good environment. However I do see why your husband would like to have some kind of support from his mom as well because you\u2019ll have yours. But again you are the one giving birth so you have the right to chose who you want or not. Discuss it with your husband on how you feel about it.", "NTA.  It's understandable that you want your mom there during what will likely be the most vulnerable time in your life, and not your MIL.  Read the Lemon Clot essay, and then send it to your husband if he doesn't understand why you might not want his mom around and gives you any push back at all.", "NTA. Your needs come first here. Either your husband or your MiL may feel that their side of the family is underrepresented for the birth, so to speak.\n\nBut it's all about what makes you happy and as stress free as possible. Your mother is first of all, your mother. Secondly, she had expert medical knowledge and experience that seems to me, to be invaluable in your situation. \n\nMiL seems like she's just there because otherwise she may feel left out?", "NTA ask your husband if he\u2019d want your parents around and in the exam room if he was having a medical procedure on his private parts.", "NTA -- I'm a mom to four boys and one girl.  I know I only have one shot to be \"the grandma\".  The other four I get to be the \"back burner grandma\" and I've come to terms with that.  I'm saying this because this is the norm for moms of boys and I hope most women realize this, especially your MIL. This is your pregnancy, your delivery and your baby.  You get to set the terms based on what you're comfortable with.  If your MIL is a sensible and reasonable woman, she is excited but just wants to be helpful.  It sounds like she probably talked to your husband and they made plans without checking with you.  It's not unreasonable for you to say that there will be too many people with their hands in the pot and you would like your mom for support.  I think MOST women are understanding of this, especially when they have been in your exact shoes.  Just talk to your husband and he can help drop the news to her.  Good luck and congratulations!\n\nEdit: I'm only referencing the pregnancy and birth aspect of being grandma.  I'm not talking about the entirety of raising children.", "NTA.

They will most likely never get to be in the birthing room as the woman is closer to her mom and what\u2019s her there only. Usually.  I have 5 kids.  One girl in the middle. I\u2019m ok never being in the room during birth. It\u2019s not my right. I can wait till after everyone is settled and clean and comfy. Babies dont expire. Some moms feel that because they have sons, then the DIL just had to put up with them being there.  Nope. Fair isn\u2019t always equal. Especially when it comes to exposing one\u2019s vagina.", "NTA, but you do need to have a conversation with your husband and MIL.  You said she is messy and it drives you nuts, but you haven\u2019t told anyone else about it or your MIL.  You need to do that.  If you are a \u2018neat freak\u2019, you must share that information because what you call messy is a another person\u2019s normal, so you have to speak up.  Your MIL can\u2019t read your mind.

If so, let the nurses know what your birth plans are. If you only want your mom and husband in the delivery room, they will make sure your wishes are enforced. \n\nWith regard to having her on the scene at the very beginning, make it clear to your husband you want MIL around when you want and not according to some alternate plans she may have.

His mother cannot take care of you, because she will be creating messes. Is his mother planning to cook? Is she planning to clean the bathroom when you leave large blood clots? Is she planning to wash baby clothes?

She just understood my SIL needed her own mom the most and didn't want to impose.", "That\u2019s kind of a gross outlook. Everyone gets to be the grandma as long as they can respect boundaries and be involved. If my kids have a primary \u201cgrandma\u201d it\u2019s my husbands mother because she\u2019s more involved, more helpful, and more respectful.

It\u2019s like telling every first time mom what a terrible time they\u2019re going to have.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s constructive.

Not the entirety of grandmahood/ lifetime", "Exactly.  Grandkids live for decades, it's ridiculous to pretend that you are a second-tier relative just because you missed the few hours of birth. It just doesn't matter much in the long run.", "No I\u00b4m sorry but Electronic-Grape is right about this, I have only boys and I realize that I will always be the second hand grandma. The mom chooses and she rearly chooses MIL even if they are on good terms. That is a fact. It however can differ if the \"mother\" of the mom is a really bad mom and they don\u00b4t get a long at all. So in my opinion OP is TA because even though she should without a doubt only have present during childbirth who she really like to be there she is trying to treat her mother in law and husband as a second hand family by not letting her be there at home and help around.", "That's awesome! I'm so glad you have a good support system.  It has been my experience, in office and in hospital, that the majority of women have their mothers with them as an additional support person though. I have had patients who grew up in foster care so their only \"support\" was their husband's family, women who have lost their mothers and women who just don't have good relationships with them.  There's always the exception. I'm just thrilled when they have love and support.", "Are you a MIL?", "I think I clearly stated my choice for \"childbirth\". I was never opposed to my MIL visiting after. Also, she did not ask if we needed help, nor did we ask because it's not like she helps around when she visits (which I didn't mind because she has fragile health and I liked to cook and clean my way anyway). The decision to come early came out of nowhere... What I am really worried about is for my mom to step back if she knows my MIL will be there too.", "who your support system is at the birth has nothing to do with being a grandparent.", "I agr\u00e9e I do not like that sub.
