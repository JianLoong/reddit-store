But that baby is coming out of your body one of two ways - neither is pleasant and both require significant healing time for you. \n\nPut the baby to one side for a second (figuratively of course) - if you had major surgery, would anyone think it is reasonable for your partner to invite guests to stay in your home without discussing it with you?

MIL is coming because...?  She has no function other than wanting to hang out with her son's new baby.  As she doesn't have a close, intimate relationship with you, you and her son will be caring for your baby, and your mom will be caring for you, ask your spouse why she is coming at that time.  It sounds like she is in a competition with your mom.  Request that she come a few weeks after baby is born & you are physically back on your feet & in a routine with your baby.  Too many people in the house can stress out a pregnant woman, delaying birth and creating a dangerous situation, and can also stress a new mom, making bfing much more challenging.

You get to set the terms based on what you're comfortable with.  If your MIL is a sensible and reasonable woman, she is excited but just wants to be helpful.  It sounds like she probably talked to your husband and they made plans without checking with you.  It's not unreasonable for you to say that there will be too many people with their hands in the pot and you would like your mom for support.

I get it could be excited about the little one coming into this world but if I were you I'd ask your mum what's the issue she 's got with MIL or what issue MIL has with your mum ? maybe there was an argument or disagreement between them ? you don't want any arguments between them about you or the baby.", "NTA I know many women who prefer their mother to be there as their mother knows them on a semi intimate basis. You did not grow up with his mother and therefore it feels awkward on your end. More then likely your husband mentioned your mom coming and his mother (mil) just took it upon herself to come. While there\u2019s no harm in it, as you said she is not aware of how much of a burden it will be. On the she does not know you the way your mother does, also on the she\u2019s untidy aspect alone. Speak with your husband and mention these points and tell him you cannot have his mom there for fear that the house with all in it will become a burden on you (a new mother) and your mom having to take care of MIL and pick up after her. Your mothers skill set is handy, you MIL skill set is not.", "My mom got upset when nephew was born because he had an extended hospital stay, and SIL's mom was in and out visiting nephew and SIL, meanwhile she was wanting to go visit. Eventually my brother convinced SIL to let my mom see nephew. \n\nThat said, based on nephew's first Christmas, I've already suggested to my mom that we give brother and SIL the option of potentially splitting the cost of a premade turkey dinner and doing Christmas at their house after nibling number 2 is born in November, or have them come over the beginning of January."]}
