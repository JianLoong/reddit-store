I have two younger brothers. I love my mom but she is an overbearing and likes to meddle. She doesn't do it to me because 1) I joined the armed forces almost right after I turned 18 (I'm 39 now) and haven't lived at home or near my hometown since then 2) I now live on the other side of the country 4000 kilometres away 3) I'm gay so there's no daughter-in-law for my mom to push around. I married my husband in 2006. Since we were both in the armed forces we had a military wedding, so there was nothing for my mom to take over when it came to the planning. My husband and I travel to visit my family only once a year and we always stay in a hotel instead of with my parents. I talk to both my parents on the phone often but I run interference between my mom and my husband so she can't bother him. It probably also helps that neither me or my husband have social media so she can't spy on us with it, and we don't want kids either.\n\nIt's a different story for my brothers. Neither of them have any boundaries with mom and they let her walk all over them and their wives/girlfriends. Mom has keys to their houses and she insists they live in the same neighbourhood as her and dad, as close to them as possible. My brothers have been married before. Both of them are divorced and one got remained. Mom took over the wedding planning. She meddles in everything including how they raise my nieces and nephews. My other brother was engaged to be married again but the relationship ended before the wedding. My mom's meddling and control definitely contributed to both of my brother's getting divorced and the end of my brother's engagement. She is involved in their daily lives and definitely butts heads with any women my brothers get involved with. \n\nMy brother who is divorced and remarried complained about mom's interference to me the last three times we talked. Both of my brothers complain about that but it was almost the only thing he talked about. After the third time I told him he only has himself to blame and that led to a fight because he thinks I don't understand. He got our other brother involved and he agrees with him (my brother) and is against me.\n\nMy brothers are adults with their own money. They are not dependent on my parents for employment, or financially. There is nothing stopping them for telling mom to back off and drawing up some boundaries. I do think they only have themselves to blame even if they try to fight me on that. What I said definitely lead to a fight but I think I'm right and not TA here.", "created_utc": 1683560258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bvne1/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_they_only_have/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
