Both of them are divorced and one got remained. Mom took over the wedding planning. She meddles in everything including how they raise my nieces and nephews. My other brother was engaged to be married again but the relationship ended before the wedding.

Your brothers are codependent on your mom because they have been groomed to be so in childhood, and that is a deeply-rooted issue that they need to address in therapy. To blame that on them is extremely insensitive. A lot of people see things in black and white terms, e.g. \"at the end of the day, you choose your own life,\" when in actuality, such reductive perspectives are extremely untrue and downright harmful.\n\nBe grateful that your circumstances and decisions allowed you to gain distance from your family dynamics, but turning around and blaming people for not consciously understanding what was happening to them on a psychological level is cruel and insensitive.

Don't you think your brothers' partners haven't tried that? And yet Mom's influence is so strong that all their relationships have ended in failure. So you, their distant older brother, just pointing your finger at them and going \"This is your fault\" is not helpful even a little bit unless you just wanted to make them feel more defensive. They are victims of an abusive relationship that has been going on their whole lives. They have never tasted freedom.\n\nDo you want to save them? Because if so you need to apologize for what you said. Being right that boundaries with their mom would improve their lives one million percent does not change that your approach was condescending, unhelpful, and insensitive. Their significant others have a right to blame them because their lives also got dragged through the muddy hellpit of mommy's control. Those women have two abusers: their husband and their husband's mom. You don't. You are the one who escaped when conditions weren't as bad. And I'm so glad you did because you were abused too, but your current victim-blaming approach will not save your brothers.\n\nSo do better. If you actually want to save them.
