When we were putting our guest list together, we included this family because it\u2019s always been my experience that no matter how distant you become, weddings and funerals are for your family to attend. Especially if you\u2019re having a large wedding like we did. They weren\u2019t on bad terms, no fights, or estrangement. So, we thought it was a great opportunity to get the siblings together. \n\nWe sent out our invitations and about a week or so later, one of his half sisters messages him and says \u201cwe won\u2019t be attending your wedding. We hardly talk, so I think it would be strange to attend your wedding.\u201d Not \u201cthank you for the invite, but we can\u2019t make it.\u201d Not \u201cwish we could come to your wedding, sorry we won\u2019t be able to\u201d if she wanted to reply at all, these would be completely normal responses.

It was nice of us, IMO, to send an invite. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. We receive something in the mail from this half sister. Lo and behold, it\u2019s a wedding invitation. We don\u2019t talk to her at all. Frankly, I\u2019ve been a little miffed about her message for 11 years. I\u2019ve never even met her. Here\u2019s where I may be the A. I refuse to go. And I don\u2019t think my husband should. On principle. I don\u2019t think we should send a nasty message, although the passive aggressive side of me would like to send a rude message saying we don\u2019t even know each other. My husband thinks I\u2019m just bitter and holding onto something far too long, but I don\u2019t think about it all the time or anything, and aid be open to meeting her, I just think maybe she should get a taste of her own medicine.

It was kind of a rude of her, sure, but you're being ridiculous and, yes, bitter. It's been **11 years**. If you feel the need to punish someone for something so insignificant and hold on to that attitude for 11 years, you've got personal issues you need to work on. \n\nTake it as a sign that she's grown, changed her mind, and that she might actually want to meet you.

But depending on her age and the situation with your husband it may have been less about being rude and more about her wanting to call to attention that she was feeling left out and ignored.\n\nBut 11 years is far too long to be this miffed still about a snotty reply. She behaved poorly, you accept the situation for what it was and you move on. \n\nIf you don't want to attend, then that is your right, but you cannot bar your husband for doing what he thinks is right for his relationship with his family. \n\nDon't make this your villain arc.", "YTA, especially if you push your husband to not go either. Eleven years over that? Yikes.
