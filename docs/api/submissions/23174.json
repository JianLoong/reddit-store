He has some half siblings that he has a bit of a relationship with. Mostly on FB. He\u2019s met them and lived with them in his younger years, but as adults, it\u2019s more of a Facebook relationship. They only live about 3 hours away and he would go visit every few years. When we were putting our guest list together, we included this family because it\u2019s always been my experience that no matter how distant you become, weddings and funerals are for your family to attend. Especially if you\u2019re having a large wedding like we did. They weren\u2019t on bad terms, no fights, or estrangement. So, we thought it was a great opportunity to get the siblings together. \n\nWe sent out our invitations and about a week or so later, one of his half sisters messages him and says \u201cwe won\u2019t be attending your wedding. We hardly talk, so I think it would be strange to attend your wedding.\u201d Not \u201cthank you for the invite, but we can\u2019t make it.\u201d Not \u201cwish we could come to your wedding, sorry we won\u2019t be able to\u201d if she wanted to reply at all, these would be completely normal responses. I think hers was a rude reply. Just don\u2019t RSVP if that\u2019s how you feel. There\u2019s no need to send a nasty message. It was nice of us, IMO, to send an invite. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. We receive something in the mail from this half sister. Lo and behold, it\u2019s a wedding invitation. We don\u2019t talk to her at all. Frankly, I\u2019ve been a little miffed about her message for 11 years. I\u2019ve never even met her. Here\u2019s where I may be the A. I refuse to go. And I don\u2019t think my husband should. On principle. I don\u2019t think we should send a nasty message, although the passive aggressive side of me would like to send a rude message saying we don\u2019t even know each other. My husband thinks I\u2019m just bitter and holding onto something far too long, but I don\u2019t think about it all the time or anything, and aid be open to meeting her, I just think maybe she should get a taste of her own medicine.

I just don\u2019t really understand why he would want to. But I wouldn\u2019t bar him. And their lack of relationship was entirely her fault. Not his. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get why the message was necessary. It was like putting salt on his wound for no reason. She is about 10 years older than him. So it\u2019s not the case of a teenager being hurt by their big brother. If anyone should be hurt, it\u2019s my husband. But he\u2019s literally the most forgiving person. To a fault. And I\u2019d like to clarify, I don\u2019t think about this thing and stew on it. I hardly recognized the name. When I asked my husband who\u2019s wedding it was, he told me his sister, and It all came flooding back. So, I was like, \u201cwell, I\u2019m not going to that.\u201d That\u2019s when he said I was being bitter. Basically, it shaped my opinion of who she was. I do  agree, people can grow. This is the only conversation we\u2019ve had about it. I appreciate the poster who said that maybe he wants to mend whatever relationship could be there. That may be true.", "NTA If you dont go.

It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t care about either of you and just is trying to get as many gifts as possible. Personally, I would just send the rsvp back with a no. I would not be passive aggressive or give any sort of reasoning. Just literally check the box NO. If she wants a reason or feels hurt (insert eye roll) she can take the time to call.

It was 11 years ago and depending on her age I\u2019m not sure it was as big of a deal as you\u2019re making it.

Move on it was 11 years ago.\n\nSounds like she was just following etiquette of inviting you to her wedding as family and just reciprocating the invite. \nJust RSVP no and move on. \nIf your husband wants to go, let him. Don\u2019t be controlling.", "Oh... you are indeed bitter... that is for sure. Do you have to go to this wedding... no... of course not. And you can respond in whatever way you wish.", "ESH-That was a odd and somewhat rude response from her, but that was also over 11 years ago(im guessing closer to 12 when you invited them). But I agree with your husband about being bitter and wanting to send a rude message back means you're not over it. You don't have to go but wanting to be nasty back is stooping to their level.", "TWBTA if you respond like she did. Show her how to respectfully decline, and mention respectfully, \u201crespectfully we cannot attend and have to decline, thank you for including us though!\u201d", "ESH you can stoop to her level, but you could also just be the bigger person and go. Support your partner who wants to improve the relationship he has with his family. Choose kindness over pettiness. Or keep being bitter about it. But it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s going to make you or your partner happy.", "NAH. I don't agree with you that SIL's message was rude but under the circumstances I think it would be a slight imposition for you to accept the invitation. I don't think the invitation is genuine.", "I\u2019m sorry I would copy and paste per Batemem her response right back to her.", "YTA. If you don't want to go that is completely valid but you have clearly been holding onto this for over a decade and that is neither healthy nor productive. You might not understand why your husband would want to go but I have a feeling it is less about it being his half-sister's wedding and more about seeing family he doesn't get a chance to see all the time.", "YTA. It was kind of a rude of her, sure, but you're being ridiculous and, yes, bitter. It's been **11 years**. If you feel the need to punish someone for something so insignificant and hold on to that attitude for 11 years, you've got personal issues you need to work on. \n\nTake it as a sign that she's grown, changed her mind, and that she might actually want to meet you. Maybe you'll discover that she's just the type of person who over-explain their reasoning and she didn't mean to offend all those years ago.", "NAH- why attend functions when you don't know the family members personally. To nothing to do with the message she sent a few years ago but to the fact theirs no relationship but a title of half sister. If you don't want to go then don't plain and simple. Let your husband decide on his own.", "ESH. \n\nWas your SIL a bit of a brat for her message when you got married 11 years ago? Yes. But depending on her age and the situation with your husband it may have been less about being rude and more about her wanting to call to attention that she was feeling left out and ignored.\n\nBut 11 years is far too long to be this miffed still about a snotty reply. She behaved poorly, you accept the situation for what it was and you move on. \n\nIf you don't want to attend, then that is your right, but you cannot bar your husband for doing what he thinks is right for his relationship with his family. \n\nDon't make this your villain arc.", "YTA, especially if you push your husband to not go either. Eleven years over that? Yikes. Your husband is right - you\u2019re being bitter, and in my opinion, over something that was a bit rude but nowhere near the kind of thing I\u2019d let live rent free in my head for more than a decade.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know if I'm mature enough not to say anything at all, but I think considering husbands reaction I probably wouldn't.

I understand wanting to respond with snark but be the better person.", "NTA- This is called a gift grab.  She likely does not want you to attend, She wants a gift.\n\nUltimately your husbands half sister. He can do what he wants.

I dont wanna go i dont go. i dont understand why people do shit they dont want to.", "Just because you received an invitation doesn't mean that you are actually wanted there. It's proper etiquette to send an invitation to someone who invited you to their wedding. SIL probably wants gifts. You are definitely not an AH for not wanting to go. However, I do think you should go with your husband if he decides to go. Get her the least expensive item on her registry, and make it into a date night for you and your hubby. Book a hotel room, get dolled up. But showing up would do more to show her that her response was rude. And if the evening turns out to be a bust, or the SIL is horrible, at least your husband will have you there for support.", "I totally agree with the opinions here that it's a gift grab.\n\nThing is you're not really bitter. You're just reciprocating the relationship that was outlined to you.  That you're not close and that they had no intention of getting close with you.  So getting invitation like this out of the blue.  There is something else at play.  Like a gift grab, or possibly a relative or mother sometimes will ask someone be invited. \n\nWhich from what you've described of your husband sounds like he probably would still give it a gift anyway.\n\nI suggest a donation in their name to some charitable organization.", "you can stay bitter about what happened 11 years ago, but does it do any good for you? Your husband possibly sees more of the positive from this invitation and you could try to do the same. Of course, nobody should force you to go to something that you don't like but if I were in a situation that was like your situation, I would go to support my husband because I love him and he would appreciate me being there with him.", "I wouldn\u2019t send a reply, I simply thought of it and smiled. That was my point in saying that at all. But I wouldn\u2019t do that. I wouldn\u2019t want to cause a prob for my husband.

I agree wholeheartedly. Go or don't go, but not going out of spite is not a good look.

OP is definitely not an AH for not wanting to go. They probably only got an invitation because she sent them one. It's proper etiquette to send an invitation to someone who invited you to their wedding. If their relationship hasn't changed over the past decade, why should they consider going? Just because she's \"family\"?", "Everyone sucks here.", "Everyone Sucks Here.", "I think it's more likely she feels guilted into making a token display.", "If SIL thought that, then she would have gone to the wedding.", "To be fair, I am less bugged by her not wanting to go (it\u2019s an invite, not a summons) than I am about holding a grudge over something from 11 years ago and also wanting her husband to not go either. If he wants to go, that\u2019s his choice. Even if it was a courtesy invite, it\u2019s still an invite."]}
