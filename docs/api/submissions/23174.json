He has some half siblings that he has a bit of a relationship with. Mostly on FB. He\u2019s met them and lived with them in his younger years, but as adults, it\u2019s more of a Facebook relationship. They only live about 3 hours away and he would go visit every few years. When we were putting our guest list together, we included this family because it\u2019s always been my experience that no matter how distant you become, weddings and funerals are for your family to attend. Especially if you\u2019re having a large wedding like we did. They weren\u2019t on bad terms, no fights, or estrangement. So, we thought it was a great opportunity to get the siblings together. \n\nWe sent out our invitations and about a week or so later, one of his half sisters messages him and says \u201cwe won\u2019t be attending your wedding. We hardly talk, so I think it would be strange to attend your wedding.\u201d Not \u201cthank you for the invite, but we can\u2019t make it.\u201d Not \u201cwish we could come to your wedding, sorry we won\u2019t be able to\u201d if she wanted to reply at all, these would be completely normal responses. I think hers was a rude reply. Just don\u2019t RSVP if that\u2019s how you feel. There\u2019s no need to send a nasty message. It was nice of us, IMO, to send an invite. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. We receive something in the mail from this half sister. Lo and behold, it\u2019s a wedding invitation. We don\u2019t talk to her at all. Frankly, I\u2019ve been a little miffed about her message for 11 years. I\u2019ve never even met her. Here\u2019s where I may be the A. I refuse to go. And I don\u2019t think my husband should. On principle. I don\u2019t think we should send a nasty message, although the passive aggressive side of me would like to send a rude message saying we don\u2019t even know each other. My husband thinks I\u2019m just bitter and holding onto something far too long, but I don\u2019t think about it all the time or anything, and aid be open to meeting her, I just think maybe she should get a taste of her own medicine.

It was kind of a rude of her, sure, but you're being ridiculous and, yes, bitter. It's been **11 years**. If you feel the need to punish someone for something so insignificant and hold on to that attitude for 11 years, you've got personal issues you need to work on. \n\nTake it as a sign that she's grown, changed her mind, and that she might actually want to meet you. Maybe you'll discover that she's just the type of person who over-explain their reasoning and she didn't mean to offend all those years ago.", "NAH- why attend functions when you don't know the family members personally. To nothing to do with the message she sent a few years ago but to the fact theirs no relationship but a title of half sister. If you don't want to go then don't plain and simple. Let your husband decide on his own.", "ESH. \n\nWas your SIL a bit of a brat for her message when you got married 11 years ago? Yes. But depending on her age and the situation with your husband it may have been less about being rude and more about her wanting to call to attention that she was feeling left out and ignored.\n\nBut 11 years is far too long to be this miffed still about a snotty reply. She behaved poorly, you accept the situation for what it was and you move on. \n\nIf you don't want to attend, then that is your right, but you cannot bar your husband for doing what he thinks is right for his relationship with his family. \n\nDon't make this your villain arc.", "YTA, especially if you push your husband to not go either. Eleven years over that? Yikes.

I don't think you should sink to her level in response, though. If your husband wants to go, let him go. But you don't feel like you have to.

But I suspect you may be verging on it by making this about your reaction to that ridiculous RSVP rather than what your husband wants in this situation.  Why is he inclined to go to the wedding? Does he want to have a better relationship with these people or does he just feel obliged. Bottom line, shouldn't this be more about how he wants to relate to his relatives than a decade-old rude message?", "NTA but you will be if you get petty. She didn't come to your wedding.

I\u2019ve been invited to two bridal showers that were absolutely gift grabs because I wasn\u2019t invited to the weddings. And that she has the audacity to do this after not attending your wedding and sending a not so nice reply? Heck no.", "NTA. She was nasty in her RSVP to your wedding and I'm sure there's been even less contact since then. So it's kind of funny that she invited the two of you to her own wedding after how she acted.

You\u2019ve held onto this for far, far too long, and you\u2019re still bitter about one comment someone you don\u2019t even know made over a decade ago.

You weren't important enough for her to attend yours, why in the world would you attend hers?", "I mean, I sort of disagree. We paid over $100/guest at our wedding. In no way did a gift compensate us for what we spent per person, especially if you think most guests provide one gift worth about $50-70 but that is one gift *per*\ncouple/family and most couples/families cost us between $200-500. I\u2019m just saying, not all invitations are gift grabs because trust me, it costs much more to invite someone than you recoup in gifts. \nMaybe half-sister and OP\u2019s husband\u2019s relationship has improved or developed in the 11 years since his wedding? Or half-sister has just grown up and learned to value family. Or wanted to build bridges. OP and husband are absolutely fine to refuse to go, but assuming half-sister is just mercenary or greedy, and not that people change in 11 years, is pretty cynical.", "Maybe she wants a gift. Maybe she said that in thoughtlessness 11 years ago and doesn't even remember it. Either way OP is NTA.", "And don\u2019t send a gift!", "This but the husband should make his own choice if he goes or not.", "that was my take, she's not been in contact and only wants a gift. take out all the pettiness from earlier and 'is this someone you want to give a gift to?'", "That\u2019s gotta be it- only thing that makes sense.\n\nI\u2019d copy and paste her message and send it back.\n\nNTA- she bluntly refused to come to your wedding because she flat said they weren\u2019t close. Why on earth would she not think it\u2019s different for HER wedding?", "She was honest with you,and perhaps was more puzzled than rude.", "This 100%", "If she meant it in the spirit of goodness she would have called you beforehand, apologized and said she was sorry for what she did 11 years ago and that it was a genuine invitation.

Honestly they're probably hoping you send a gift in place of attending. It's transparent as day and audacious, imo.", "Op, if you don't want to go, then don't go but think about the possibility of going and being so nice to her that would draw her crazy. \nIf you are from America buy her a kettle as a wedding gift (she would be flabbergasted about this for sure) or any other cheap crap (don't give this Bee any money!) and write her beautiful card with her words from 2012. \nKill her with kindness during her wedding and be a B in the card. \nBtw if you choose not to go - NTA, if you choose to go- NTA, but if you forbid your husband to go YWBTA", "Meh, let it go.

She sounds lovely.", "If she thought that, a simple no in the RSVP would suffice.", "And 11 years have gone by and they still have not talked, or really even seen each other in person.\n\nSo it holds true just as it did 11 years ago.

And about an event like a wedding where it's most likely that OP and her husband were invited so that they would bring a gift, I feel as a good time too.\n\nDon't send the petty message, but don't go. If you're asked why, then give the reason. Because at that point, they asked for an answer and all you did was give one.", "An invitation IS a gift grab if you invite people you don\u2019t think will attend, but will still send a gift anyway.

She doesn't even know her SiL, hasn't met her, and what little she knows of her, is rather negative.", "If hubby goes, all she gets is a cheap gift. She doesn't deserve a good one.", "This is definitely one of those situations where you keep your puzzlement to yourself or at least only share it with people who are closer to you and who will understand where you're coming from.

OK, Fair point.", "oof! That's too bad for OP's husband. \n\nBut OP's invitation probably seemed like a present grab too.
