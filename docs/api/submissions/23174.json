He has some half siblings that he has a bit of a relationship with. Mostly on FB. He\u2019s met them and lived with them in his younger years, but as adults, it\u2019s more of a Facebook relationship. They only live about 3 hours away and he would go visit every few years. When we were putting our guest list together, we included this family because it\u2019s always been my experience that no matter how distant you become, weddings and funerals are for your family to attend. Especially if you\u2019re having a large wedding like we did. They weren\u2019t on bad terms, no fights, or estrangement. So, we thought it was a great opportunity to get the siblings together. \n\nWe sent out our invitations and about a week or so later, one of his half sisters messages him and says \u201cwe won\u2019t be attending your wedding. We hardly talk, so I think it would be strange to attend your wedding.\u201d Not \u201cthank you for the invite, but we can\u2019t make it.\u201d Not \u201cwish we could come to your wedding, sorry we won\u2019t be able to\u201d if she wanted to reply at all, these would be completely normal responses. I think hers was a rude reply. Just don\u2019t RSVP if that\u2019s how you feel. There\u2019s no need to send a nasty message. It was nice of us, IMO, to send an invite. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. We receive something in the mail from this half sister. Lo and behold, it\u2019s a wedding invitation. We don\u2019t talk to her at all. Frankly, I\u2019ve been a little miffed about her message for 11 years. I\u2019ve never even met her. Here\u2019s where I may be the A. I refuse to go. And I don\u2019t think my husband should. On principle. I don\u2019t think we should send a nasty message, although the passive aggressive side of me would like to send a rude message saying we don\u2019t even know each other. My husband thinks I\u2019m just bitter and holding onto something far too long, but I don\u2019t think about it all the time or anything, and aid be open to meeting her, I just think maybe she should get a taste of her own medicine.

It was kind of a rude of her, sure, but you're being ridiculous and, yes, bitter. It's been **11 years**. If you feel the need to punish someone for something so insignificant and hold on to that attitude for 11 years, you've got personal issues you need to work on. \n\nTake it as a sign that she's grown, changed her mind, and that she might actually want to meet you. Maybe you'll discover that she's just the type of person who over-explain their reasoning and she didn't mean to offend all those years ago.", "NAH- why attend functions when you don't know the family members personally. To nothing to do with the message she sent a few years ago but to the fact theirs no relationship but a title of half sister. If you don't want to go then don't plain and simple. Let your husband decide on his own.", "ESH. \n\nWas your SIL a bit of a brat for her message when you got married 11 years ago? Yes. But depending on her age and the situation with your husband it may have been less about being rude and more about her wanting to call to attention that she was feeling left out and ignored.\n\nBut 11 years is far too long to be this miffed still about a snotty reply. She behaved poorly, you accept the situation for what it was and you move on. \n\nIf you don't want to attend, then that is your right, but you cannot bar your husband for doing what he thinks is right for his relationship with his family. \n\nDon't make this your villain arc.", "YTA, especially if you push your husband to not go either. Eleven years over that? Yikes.

A lot of times it\u2019s that or a funeral you see extended family. Most weddings, you barely talk to the bridal couple. \n\nI\u2019d go and stiff them on the gift.", "Of course you don't need to go, but you also shouldn't send a nasty message. This is your husband's relationship to manage.", "I would just politely decline and do something that you enjoy. At least you can have manors.", "I'm not disagreeing with your overall point.\n\n>but people do mellow out a little as they get older\n\nThe sister is about 10 years older than him which means she was close to 50 years old when she sent the snarky message and is about 60 years old now.

You first.", "I don\u2019t really see it as you being bitter: you said you don\u2019t know her and she doesn\u2019t talk to your husband.\nThis (rude) response to your wedding invitation is the one (or one of the few) interaction you have had with her.\nI wouldn\u2019t want to go at her wedding either.\nTo me, the important thing is that you don\u2019t force your husband to stato home if he does want to go", "A consideration she didn\u2019t bother to afford you. Good for you; I\u2019d be tempted to be petty too.", "Can you imagine?! \n\nNot only ghosted but also have your presence and your gift scrutinized the entire time. \n\nThere\u2019s always one trained doormat talking about \u201cdo it for the kindness\u201d."]}
