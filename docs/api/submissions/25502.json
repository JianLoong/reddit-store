As far as I understand it, they did not want to get married initially because Brooke is vehemently child-free, and Mark agrees with her, but they have decided to hold a wedding/commitment ceremony next spring after a lot of years of back and forth. The problem is, I\u2019ve known Mark since I was a kid (he started coming around to the house a lot when he and Brooke were sophomores in high school, so I was eight or so when I first met him as Brooke\u2019s boyfriend, and I have basically hated him the whole time. I\u2019ve tried to be polite, particularly now that we are all adults, but I just don\u2019t want to go to the wedding of my sister and the guy she\u2019s always put before her family. \n\nAs an example, when Brooke and Mark started dating, Brooke went from eating dinner at home with the rest of us every night to going out two or three times a week with Mark and his friends. This was against our parent\u2019s rules, and caused a lot of arguments that negatively impacted both me and our younger sister Jenny (who was barely in kindergarten at the time and didn\u2019t understand what was going on). \n\nBrooke and our parents started fighting basically every night, and it was incredibly disruptive to our home life. My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it. \n\nThe stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that. I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes. Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch, so she doesn\u2019t remember those years as negatively as I do. \n\nOf course, as soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college. Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn\u2019t come home over Christmas or summers. Eventually things cooled down when I was in high school and Brooke started making more contact with our family, but Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and suddenly declare that it was time for them to go. \n\nI don\u2019t think I should have to go to the wedding of my sister and this guy that stole her from us, and I am planning on RSVP-ing \u201cno\u201d when the time comes. Our family has been minimally involved in wedding planning, and I am not in the bridal party or anything like that (they are all friends of Brooke and Mark\u2019s from the hospital where they work).\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: I am getting a lot of feedback that Brooke was potentially parentified. If anyone has recommendations for podcasts or books about that, I would appreciate it. I think I need to learn more about her experiences before I decide about the wedding, since we did use to be close and it would be unfortunate to lose the relationship entirely (which is what some commenters think will happen if I skip the wedding). Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: Please stop attacking my parents. They have their faults but they did not have many resources when we were young. It\u2019s important to me to support them now that they are older and can\u2019t work but I also want to support Brooke and understand better now that I have not been handling this in a mature way. I will be apologizing to her and asking for more of her perspective on things from our childhood. I\u2019m going to stop reading now but I appreciate your help.

You seem to have a lot of family problems that have made you bitter but they aren't all Mark's fault, your sister and parents were in this dynamic, too. YWBTA", "INFO\n\nNone of the problems you described were Mark's fault. Brooke started having the usually teen feelings of wanting to be more independent and getting invested in her relationships and that conflicted with your parents' rules. That's not on Mark. You have not described any single action or statement that makes it clear whether Mark is controlling or just objects to your parents trying to control their now adult daughter.\n\nSo why is your issue specifically with Mark? Or is he just the easy scapegoat for your family not being as comfortably and conflicted-free as when you were a child?\n\n>The stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that.

Your parents were neglectful. Mark may simply have been invested in getting Brook away from a bad family situation.", "INFO:\nWhy are you blaming your sister for your parents' behavior?  Did they train you to blame her?  Did they vent their frustrations upon you?  Did they constantly talk about how bad she was and that bad things were happening because it was her fault?   If so, that is abuse and you've been a victim of gaslighting at home.", "YWBTA. Your family is weird AF. You haven't listed one thing that Brooke and Mark did that's not normal. So, you freaked out and failed math because your sister went out to eat? Your parents are the real AHs. They created a toxic environment in the home", "YTA. He didn't make her do any of these things and best we can tell she's happy with him.  You seem hurt your sister grew up and moved on and left you in what I'm guessing was a bad environment  with your parents. Blaming a sister's  boyfriend for you  going to school dirty  or failing 4th grade also seems very strange.", "You don't have to go if you don't want to, but YTA for blaming all your family's problems on Mark.\n\nIt sounds like there was fighting because Brooke wanted some freedom and space, and I can see why if you guys are still trying to guilt her for leaving for college and blaming any problem you have on her relationship. Your parents' neglect is their own fault, not Mark's.\n\nMark didn't \"steal\" her from you guys, she doesn't belong to you. Brooke wanted to get some distance from her family and it sounds like it's probably the healthiest thing for her tbh.", "YTA not for simply not attending but for you using Mark as the scapegoat to all your life issues.  You were under 10 when they got together.  Time to let the tantrum go and grow up.  We all need  be accountable for our words and actions.  Sounds like your sister was the typical teen.", "INFO - Brooke was 16 when you were a small child.  Your parents seemed to have been the ones that punished you for whatever she was doing at that time.  It is weird at that younger age to have all of those feelings, and go thru all of those thoughts without your parents putting all of that stuff in your head.  Have you talked to Brooke about it.  It seems there is probably a lot here that you didn't quite understand at the time, that built into anger for them.  I feel like there is so much more to this story.", "I think you're being childish and petty over stupid shit. I think it's insane that one of your examples is she wasn't eating at home as often.\n\nFrankly you are blaming your sister for shit you aren't entitled to. You failed math. No one else made you do that.\n\nYour parents sound just as immature. Why aren't you blaming them for creating a toxic home life?  Why aren't you mad at them you had to take care of your younger sister? She's their child!\n\nThe way you talk it's like you feel ownership over her instead of being an individual. It's weird. \n\nIt's like grow up and get over it. Jesus. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYour are blaming the wrong people here. None of this was on Brooke or Mark. This was your parents and your parents alone.\n\nFirst, it sounds like Brooke was being a normal teenager. It\u2019s normal to spend more time with friends and boyfriends as you hit your teenage years. And her pushing back on your parents rules and even your parent\u2019s religion is all very normal teenage behaviour. It sounds like your parents were quite strict/demanding and that makes any push back all that much harder.\n\nSecond, your parents are responsible for the stress in your house redirect on you in a way that meant you were neglected. You were just a child and should have been cared for and given attention regardless of what was going on with your sister. The fact your clothes weren\u2019t being cleaned because of this is on your parents and your parents alone.\n\nYou really should look into therapy. It sounds like you have a lot of understandable anger about your childhood but are putting it all in the wrong place.", "Wait, so your high school aged sister got a boyfriend, with whom she socialized, and it fucked your parents up so much that they *stopped caring for the rest of their children*? That\u2019s abuse. Your parents abused you, according to your post. And you\u2019re angry at your sister for escaping that situation? \n\nI think you need to take a big step back from all of this until you can look at the situation objectively. It honestly sounds like you\u2019re angry at your sister for acting her age, and because your parents abused you, you blame her for problems that she\u2019s obviously not responsible for causing. It sounds like you\u2019ve experienced a lot of pain from all of this. I\u2019m sorry for that. I think you should talk to someone about this. Someone who can help you break down and reorganize your thoughts. YWBTA if you hurt your sister out of spite because of your messed up childhood.", "YTA. You need to grow up and take your blinders off. \n\nYour sister behaved like an average person with a boyfriend. Your parents were overly controlling and reactive. Your sister and Mark didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Your negative childhood experiences are solely the fault of your parents.", "What I get from your post is that your parents tried to impose \"my way or the highway\" to your sister and she had a backbone, so it exploded in fights at home. But your parents are the adults, not your sister (at the time). The dysfunction is more due to their choices and actions, and less to hers, and not at all to her boyfriend's actions.\n\nInstead of having supper everyday at home, it was 4 or 5 times a week and your parents managed to blow up the household over that? To what end?\n\nWhy do you blame the fianc\u00e9 for this and not your parents?\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  \n\n\njust don't go, don't blame the other guy, also its sounds like all he did was help your sister gain independence potentally from overly strict parents .  \n\n\nthere is nothing wrong with going out with friends multiple nights a week", "Soooo\u2026. Your parents have basically neglected you and your little sister because they were fighting with their eldest and you blame her boyfriend? Wow.\n\nHe didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d your sister from her family. He didn\u2019t force her to fight with your parents - they created an unhealthy environment and made her choose. \n\nYTA. But sorry for you shitty childhood, you deserved better.", "Whether you go to the wedding or not doesn\u2019t really matter. \n\nWhat matters here is that your parents here have been terrible parents to all 3 of you! As an adult you should realize that by now. Your teenage sister should not have had to be like a parent to you. They got so mad at her about not being home for supper every day that it caused you to fail 4th grade\u2026 like seriously wtf were they doing. It sounds like they had really unreasonable expectations of your sister and she did what any normal teenager would do and pushed back. The fact that your parents let that situation get so toxic that you failed 4th grade is not your sisters fault or her boyfriends fault. YOUR PARENTS were the adults. YOUR PARENTS were responsible for you and helping you succeed at school. YOUR PARENTS created a toxic environment. YOUR PARENTS are the ones who failed. \n\nI grew up in a very happy family and also moved away to go to college. This is a totally normal thing to do. Blaming a boyfriend for stealing your sister away is not normal. \n\nI\u2019m honestly surprised anyone in your family was even invited to that wedding. Everything you wrote in this post makes you sound like an AH, but the real assholes are your parents who blame their own failures on teenagers.", "YTA.\n\nMark didn't \"steal\" her from you.  Your sister made choices.  And your parents also made poor choices by ignoring you and your sister.", "YTA, not for missing the wedding, that\u2019s your choice, but your sister and mark are not responsible for any of these issues, and honestly Brooke sounds like a normal teenager with a boyfriend,", "If you really don't support the wedding, don't go. But also, don't be surprised if Brooke considers this a massive betrayal and your relationship with her becomes even more fraught to non existent. And the only person to blame there would be you. \n\nHowever, you need therapy to get over these issues because you're clearly carrying trauma from that time and you're misdirecting the blame. Brooke and Mark were doing common teenaged stuff. \n\nBut overall, YWBTA because you're blaming the wrong people for this mess.", "YTA\n\nYou have not given a single valid reason for hating Mark. \n\nBrooke was a teen who wanted to spend time with her boyfriend. She still ate at home 4 to 5 nights a week. That wasn't good enough for your parents. They caused the tension. Not Brooke. Not Mark. \n\nAlso, plenty of people move far away from home for college. Maybe Brooke wanted to follow Mark. Or maybe she wanted space from your parents. Ultimately, it doesn't matter why she went to the college she did. She's allowed to live her life how she sees fit. \n\nIf you really don't want to go to the wedding, that's on you. But if you want a relationship with Brooke, skipping the wedding will put that in jeopardy.", "YTA. Your parents are the ones who did something wrong here, not Brooke or Mark.", "You\u2019re TA, you guys treat him like he\u2019s a horrible guy because your sister made decisions on her own, but you blame him for her decisions, so of course he glares at you all, because he\u2019s constantly been blamed for decisions that were your sisters choice or his, he didn\u2019t force her to do anything. He didn\u2019t take her away from you, you guys don\u2019t own her, she has her own life.\n\nAnd supportive and go to the wedding, act like her family not her owners for once.\n\nBlaming mark for everything that wasn\u2019t his fault or choice, grow up, apologise to mark for blaming him for things other people did, your sister and parents, stop acting like you\u2019re still 5 with the whole \u201che stole her from us\u201d she\u2019s not your property, she has to have her own life and not be in her families pocket forever, it isn\u2019t Marks fault your parents acted how they did towards you, or your sister acted as she did and not his fault you were bullied.\n\nQuit blaming Mark, that guys the only victim here, been blamed because he fell In Love with your sister and you guys are jealous of him for that.. your her family not her life partners, you shouldn\u2019t be jealous of her partner. Your family sounds toxic, maybe that\u2019s why she stayed away, not because of Mark but because your families toxic.

Also why would Brooke spending more time equate to your parents not packing your younger sisters lunch? You should never of been doing that. I see nothing wrong with how Brooke or Mark acted but I am concerned with how your parents acted. Would they do the same thing if you were in a relationship? Might be a question worth exploring. I would go and support your Sister and Mark. Once those blinders come off you may need them.", "INFO: Are you in therapy to unpack any of this? This reads like abandonment and neglect were a running theme for most of your childhood between your sister and parents.

Sounds like Mark got Brooke out of a toxic home and he can\u2019t stand your parents for good reason.", "YTA, I feel bad for Brooke and Mark. Why are Brooke and Mark the scapegoats? You and your parents are responsible for you failing 4th grade. I'm surprised Brooke has contact with you or your parents.", "Your being very immature. Your sister behaved normally in trying to find autonomy and agency as a teenager. She wanted to hang out with him and her friends a lot. That\u2019s also normal. Going out 2-3 nights a week with her boyfriend is not abnormal or strange. You are blaming her for a lot of things that in reality just aren\u2019t her fault. It makes sense that when she moved away for college that she went low contact with your controlling parents. Why would she come home for Christmas in that toxic environment? \n\nHe didn\u2019t steal her from you. Your parents pushed her away by trying to control her every move.

You were a little kid and she was a teenager, of course you weren't the center of her world because SHE IS YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOUR MOMMY! \n\nYou then blame Brook for your failing math. What the hell does she have to do with your ability to succeed academically? You blame Brooke for your younger sister struggling academically and socially. Again: SHE IS YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOUR MOMMY! \n\nYou are upset that your sister went to college across the country. That is pretty normal behavior. Not coming home at all during college isn't, and it makes me question what was the real problem. I noticed that you don't mention anything about your parents other than them having some arbitrary rule about dinner and Mark obviously not liking them. You also don't mention even trying to make an effort to get to know Mark. You say that he glared at your parents, do you think it may be because they may be the problem?", "I genuinely don\u2019t understand how your sister eating dinner somewhere else a few times a week was such a big deal that it derailed your entire life.

Outrageous.\n\nIn all seriousness, grow the fuck up, Brooke deciding to have dinner with her boyfriend some nights is perfectly normal and your parents were ridiculous, and them caring more about that than you having clean clothes or passing math is not Brookes nor her fiance's fault. \nMoving to another country was Brooke's decision, and no wonder she wanted to get away from your parents toxicity, you keep blaming Mark for choices your sister made.\n\nFrankly, I think you shouldn't go to the wedding, they don't need your bullshit.", "YTA.

Everything \u201cwrong\u201d you described your sister doing was normal teenager things. Your sister isn\u2019t your parent and she will never be your parent and cannot be held accountable to the failures of your actual parents. Last thing, it seems like your sister inviting you to her wedding is her way of slowly inviting you back into her life. If you don\u2019t go or go with this bitter grudge that could potentially ruin your relationship for decades if not life because this wedding is a big deal. Food for thought, you\u2019re both adults but with everything your family has put her through I think you\u2019re lucky she\u2019s even inviting you.", "So you had a bad home situation and your sister found a way to get out of it and you\u2019re blaming her boyfriend for it? Yeah, YTA.

Maybe your family situation didn\u2019t help, but hell, that\u2019s nowhere near his fault)", "I have to say YWBTA. You haven't given any examples of Brooke or her fianc\u00e9 doing anything malicious or harmful. They simply lived their lives as they chose. Your problems were not their fault.", "YTA. Is it possible your parents were controlling towards Brooke and she was actively trying to get away from them?", "YTA.You sound incredibly selfish and self-absorbed. Your sister wasn't home for dinner a few times a week so that ruined your childhood? Do you even realise how ridiculous you sound?Looks like Mark helped your sister set boundaries and get away from your parents who were parentifying her. If your parents didn't have the resources to have so many kids then they shouldn't have had so many kids. It's not Brooke's problem. Also calling your sister's fiance the guy who \"stole her\" from you? That's so weird and unhealthy.

You disagree with the wedding, you don't like it, you don't have to go. But whenever this kind of question comes up, I think it's important to ask yourself, imagine we are 10, 20, 30 years in the future. And they are still together. Would you want this decision to not attend a wedding, the decision to not put up with it for 1 day, to still cause a rift between you and them? It's their big day. They only have one of these in their relationship. Only one in their life, assuming they stay together, which considering how long they have been together seems likely. It's a small effort to attend, and if you don't it could have a big impact on your relationship with your sister.\n\nAgain, though, you aren't the asshole if you don't attend.

My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it. \n\nThe stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that. I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes. Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch, so she doesn\u2019t remember those years as negatively as I do. \n\nOf course, as soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college. Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn\u2019t come home over Christmas or summers. Eventually things cooled down when I was in high school and Brooke started making more contact with our family, but Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and suddenly declare that it was time for them to go. \n\nI don\u2019t think I should have to go to the wedding of my sister and this guy that stole her from us, and I am planning on RSVP-ing \u201cno\u201d when the time comes. Our family has been minimally involved in wedding planning, and I am not in the bridal party or anything like that (they are all friends of Brooke and Mark\u2019s from the hospital where they work).\n\nWIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it. \n\nAgain, she was growing up and becoming more independent. What was he supposed to do? Tell her to not become her own person?\n\n> The stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that. I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes.\n\nWhile unfortunate, it's not your sister's fault.  You failed math, it happens. It's your parents responsibility to make sure you have what you need, regardless of any tension with your sister.\n\n> Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch, so she doesn\u2019t remember those years as negatively as I do. \n\nYou stepped up where your parents failed; that's still neither Brooke's fault or responsibility.\n\n> Of course, as soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college.\n\nOr maybe they got into a good college across thr country?\n\n> Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn\u2019t come home over Christmas or summers. Eventually things cooled down when I was in high school and Brooke started making more contact with our family, but Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and suddenly declare that it was time for them to go. \n\nSounds like she chose to go LC.

Like not even allowed to have boys over at all, yet my brother could sleep in the same room/bed as a girl. \n\nWhile I am sure your family life wasn't the exact same as mine, it does sound similar to my upbringing and the countless other strict upbringings of people around me. When they had their first taste of freedom, the didn't walk...they ran, because their parents were so controlling and strict that they had never experienced living. Usually, the person to bring that freedom was a boyfriend or girlfriend, so of course the parents blamed them. \n\nI am guessing that because you were so young, it was easy for your parents to blame Mark and you to just believe it because you saw how hard it was on the family. At a time that you most likely still trusted your parents and believed they had your best interest at heart. The sad reality of life is finding out your parents are not the best. That they don't always have your best interest at heart, and may not be as great as you once thought. I had to learn that lesson the hard way. \n\nThis was not Marks fault.

It\u2019s time for you to get therapy, because your childhood was not normal or healthy, and you haven\u2019t really processed it. \n\nLet\u2019s go through your post.\n\n> Brooke went from eating dinner at home with the rest of us every night to going out two or three times a week with Mark and his friends.\n\n1. This is normal, healthy teenage socialization. \n\n> This was against our parents\u2019 rules and caused a lot of arguments that negatively impacted both me and our younger sister Jenny.\n\nThese rules were unfair. Why did the arguments negatively impact you two? Did your parents scream and yell a lot? Did Brooke yell and your parents escalated or matched the yelling? Did your parents\u2019 anger have negative consequences for you guys? If any of that is the case, that is your parents\u2019 fault, not Brooke\u2019s, and it speaks to a level of emotional immaturity that creates unhealthy parenting dynamics. \n\n> My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it.\n\n2. You are blaming Mark for your sister\u2019s decisions - but her decisions are reasonable and appropriate, and it is your parents who have turned what should be normal teenager dynamics into something unhealthy. \n\nAnother thing is that it is *necessary* for teenagers to explore their identity outside of the family unit. This is a vital part of their development. Check our Erikson\u2019s stages of psychosocial development and the Fidelity stage: Identity vs role confusion (ages 11-19). \n\n> The stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math)\n\n3. So your parents weren\u2019t paying enough attention to notice you falling behind and to get you help? No tutoring or counseling? That is *not* Brooke\u2019s fault. \n\n> and I was bullied really badly for that.\n\nIt was the job of the *adults* in your life to protect you from that.\n\n> I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes.\n\nYour parents neglected you, and you have somehow blamed other people for their bad behavior.\n\n> Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch\n\nThis is parentification, like all the other commenters have said. You are upset and feel abandoned by Brooke because she didn\u2019t do for you what you did for Jenny. But you should never have been placed in that position in the first place. You are mad at Brooke because you are too scared to be mad at your parents. You are mad at Brooke because it feels safer than processing the fear and heartbreak of taking on adult responsibilities at such a young age. You are mad at Brooke because you are jealous that she didn\u2019t take on those responsibilities and you feel like you had to.\n\n\n> As soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college \n\n4. This is normal young adult stuff. It\u2019s really common for people to choose to go to college somewhere completely different from where they grew up. Sometimes it\u2019s because it\u2019s different - the culture, the food, the environment. Sometimes it\u2019s the school itself. Sometimes it\u2019s to get away from a bad family situation. \n\n> Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn\u2019t come home over Christmas or summers.\n\nThat sounds like a sad situation for all of you. I think you need to re-examine *why* you\u2019re blaming Mark for all of this.\n\n\n> Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and \u201csuddenly\u201d [quotes mine] declare it was time for them to go.\n\n5. Mark knows more about what went on than you do, simply because you were not old enough to notice or understand everything, and not only was he there, but he also talked to your sister. But see my quotes? This to me reads like your parents were constantly out of line and he would intervene when your sister had had enough. \n\nMark is your sister\u2019s confidant; he has her best interest at heart\u2026 but your whole post is about **you**. \n\nOP ask your sister about her perspective, and do nothing but **listen**.

You admit that your parents were never around because they were always working to financially provide for your family. It was your sister's job to raise you and your sister. That was never going to be sustainable in the long run. Your sister was a child herself. An older child sure, but still a kid. That's  a lot of pressure. It was always going to fall apart.\n\nEven without Mark, Brooke might have realized she wanted the life like a normal teenager. She might have still left the house 2 to 3 times a week to see friends. Or even if she had stayed home, she probably still would have had less time for you and Jenny if she dared focus on her own academics.\n\nBut okay, let's say she never rebelled while at home. Let's play this out. Brooke still would have graduated and turned 18 eventually. You say in your post that Brooke is vehemently against having kids of her own.   Obviously, as much as she loved you and Jenny, she resented having to raise you. There's every reason to believe she wanted out. And there's every reason to believe that your parents would not have supported that. \n\nWithout Mark, she probably couldn't have afforded to move across the country, but she definitely still would have left. And she definitely would have known not to visit home. Your parents would have taken advantage of her if she had. And if she kept in contact, your parents would have put her down for not supporting family. They would have used any chance they got to guilt her. To shame her. Brooke was always going to leave. Even if you had had a healthy family, she still would have eventually left, because that's normal. Repeat after me: 18 year olds leaving home and having their own lives is normal. Not coming home to visit, when your parents mistreat you, is also normal, by the way.\n\nMark didn't steal Brooke. Your parents took advantage of her over and over and over again. Your parents abused her. There are different types of abuse besides physical abuse. This was abuse OP. Leaving was always the only answer. Leaving was always the healthy answer.

My mom, who wanted all these kids, stayed at home. There was zero reason for her not to be getting us up in the morning, not keeping up with the housework by using a chore chart or something. The saddest part is that they missed out on crucial moments of our childhood.

I'm 1000% paying for a ticket to sit there.", "YTA for blaming Mark, but good on you for seeming to be willing to accept that you\u2019ve been unfairly blaming them and now want to try and repair that relationship (I saw your other post)", "I'm sorrry,what? Brooke is a 32 year old fully brain developed  adult,who is educated,without children,there is no way after what she went through in her childhood that she stays with an abusive Mark. Maybe not a Saint,but at the very least a good man. Even with Op's bias,Mark still comes off well from everything op has said.", "The problem is that Brooke WAS responsible for OP's academics, She  WAS responsible for her younger sisters' mental health and probably much more, most likely for laundering the clothes they had to wear,  like, dinner, dishes, and bathing.  I think OP might have forgotten that Brooke was her \"parent\" that's why when she left they were not taken care of by \"mom and dad \" because they never took care of them to begin with.", "You think they were trying their best?\n\nThey let their daughter fail 4th grade math.\n\nThey let their daughter go to school and dirty clothes.\n\nThose things are only one person's responsibility and it's theirs. Not your sisters. Not Mark. Theirs.\n\nIf they were so wrapped up and screaming at a girl who wasn't even there half the time that they couldn't even make sure you had clean clothes and education, they were absolutely awful parents.", "Is your therapist part of your religious community? Someone who has an interest in keeping you within that community and obeying your elders? Someone who views kids being forced to raise other kids is normal?", ">but I do believe that they were trying their best under difficult circumstances\n\nSo you grant your parents, who were ADULTS, grace and forgiveness cause they were \"doing their best\", but Mark, who was a literal child when you met him (cause teenagers are children) and was just standing up for your sister, who was his girlfriend, deserves a lifetime of your hate and blame?\n\nBruh.", "Well, yeah, but OP is 25. That's old enough to have already figured out that your parents are A Hs. By that age I had long since figured that out.", "I know. I\u2019m impressed with this guy.", "I'm \"Mark\" in this case - my husband is from an old school Eastern European family and he is the first born and only boy. When we started dating I really encouraged him to grow, become autonomous, and have a voice, because growing up he was basically made to feel like his feelings didn't matter and he just needed to do what he was told.\n\nHis family (parents and sister) did NOT respond well and have blamed me for EVERYTHING. We've been together 12 years now and my husband basically has no relationship with his sister anymore and is low contact with his parents as a direct result of how they've treated me and our relationship.\n\nOP is headed for a no/low contact situation if he doesn't lay off his poor sister and work on being a better family member.\n\nOh and YTA big time, OP.", "Same here !", "Even without the parents placing extra blame, it's easy to find a crutch like this as a child. \n\n  *Why aren't my parents looking after me?* Because they're too busy being mad at sister.\n\n  *Why isn't sister here anymore?* It's all her new boyfriends fault. \n\n  Both are pretty childish views and I wouldn't be shocked if OP came to those conclusions all on their own.", "You\u2019re right that Mark comes across as a nice guy who was hugely helpful for Brooke.\n\nBut it\u2019s not uncommon for people with abusive families of origin to end up with abusive partners because they\u2019re desperate or they don\u2019t have a good sense of what healthy relationships look like. And people end up in abusive relationships even if they\u2019re \u201cfully brain developed\u201d (?) and educated and don\u2019t have kids.", "Exactly. Why are they not offering the same grace and understanding to Brooke and Mark? They were also doing their best under their circumstances, too.", "I'll have to disagree with you here. Sometimes it takes a lot longer than 25 to figure it out. Speaking from personal experience. I got there. Finally.", "We should all hope to be Mark.", "I wouldn\u2019t assume that. People who grow up with abusive parents often gravitate toward similarly abusive romantic partners. Maybe Mark is the Prince Charming who liberated Brooke from her repressive family, but it\u2019s just as likely he\u2019s equally toxic and controlling. I agree that OP\u2019s parents are the clear problem based on the facts outlined here, but that doesn\u2019t automatically make Mark a hero.", "Yeah everyone\u2019s different. My generation didn\u2019t start processing things till our later 20s.", "Boyfriend literally didn't do anything except typical boyfriend stuff.\n\nThat's like hating a chair for having four legs and letting you sit on it.", "OK that\u2019s strange and you need to explore that. Children are supposed to grow up, move away and start their own lives. This is a really strange reaction to the realities of life from you. I think you need to explore that.", "Yeah, I'm in my 50s and didn't start figuring things out until I was in my 30s."]}
