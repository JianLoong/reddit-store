As far as I understand it, they did not want to get married initially because Brooke is vehemently child-free, and Mark agrees with her, but they have decided to hold a wedding/commitment ceremony next spring after a lot of years of back and forth. The problem is, I\u2019ve known Mark since I was a kid (he started coming around to the house a lot when he and Brooke were sophomores in high school, so I was eight or so when I first met him as Brooke\u2019s boyfriend, and I have basically hated him the whole time. I\u2019ve tried to be polite, particularly now that we are all adults, but I just don\u2019t want to go to the wedding of my sister and the guy she\u2019s always put before her family. \n\nAs an example, when Brooke and Mark started dating, Brooke went from eating dinner at home with the rest of us every night to going out two or three times a week with Mark and his friends. This was against our parent\u2019s rules, and caused a lot of arguments that negatively impacted both me and our younger sister Jenny (who was barely in kindergarten at the time and didn\u2019t understand what was going on). \n\nBrooke and our parents started fighting basically every night, and it was incredibly disruptive to our home life. My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it. \n\nThe stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that. I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes. Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch, so she doesn\u2019t remember those years as negatively as I do. \n\nOf course, as soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college. Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn\u2019t come home over Christmas or summers. Eventually things cooled down when I was in high school and Brooke started making more contact with our family, but Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and suddenly declare that it was time for them to go. \n\nI don\u2019t think I should have to go to the wedding of my sister and this guy that stole her from us, and I am planning on RSVP-ing \u201cno\u201d when the time comes. Our family has been minimally involved in wedding planning, and I am not in the bridal party or anything like that (they are all friends of Brooke and Mark\u2019s from the hospital where they work).\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: I am getting a lot of feedback that Brooke was potentially parentified. If anyone has recommendations for podcasts or books about that, I would appreciate it. I think I need to learn more about her experiences before I decide about the wedding, since we did use to be close and it would be unfortunate to lose the relationship entirely (which is what some commenters think will happen if I skip the wedding). Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: Please stop attacking my parents. They have their faults but they did not have many resources when we were young. It\u2019s important to me to support them now that they are older and can\u2019t work but I also want to support Brooke and understand better now that I have not been handling this in a mature way. I will be apologizing to her and asking for more of her perspective on things from our childhood. I\u2019m going to stop reading now but I appreciate your help.

You seem to have a lot of family problems that have made you bitter but they aren't all Mark's fault, your sister and parents were in this dynamic, too. YWBTA", "INFO\n\nNone of the problems you described were Mark's fault. Brooke started having the usually teen feelings of wanting to be more independent and getting invested in her relationships and that conflicted with your parents' rules. That's not on Mark. You have not described any single action or statement that makes it clear whether Mark is controlling or just objects to your parents trying to control their now adult daughter.\n\nSo why is your issue specifically with Mark? Or is he just the easy scapegoat for your family not being as comfortably and conflicted-free as when you were a child?\n\n>The stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that.

Your parents were neglectful. Mark may simply have been invested in getting Brook away from a bad family situation.", "INFO:\nWhy are you blaming your sister for your parents' behavior?  Did they train you to blame her?  Did they vent their frustrations upon you?  Did they constantly talk about how bad she was and that bad things were happening because it was her fault?   If so, that is abuse and you've been a victim of gaslighting at home.", "YWBTA. Your family is weird AF. You haven't listed one thing that Brooke and Mark did that's not normal. So, you freaked out and failed math because your sister went out to eat? Your parents are the real AHs. They created a toxic environment in the home", "YTA. He didn't make her do any of these things and best we can tell she's happy with him.  You seem hurt your sister grew up and moved on and left you in what I'm guessing was a bad environment  with your parents. Blaming a sister's  boyfriend for you  going to school dirty  or failing 4th grade also seems very strange.", "You don't have to go if you don't want to, but YTA for blaming all your family's problems on Mark.\n\nIt sounds like there was fighting because Brooke wanted some freedom and space, and I can see why if you guys are still trying to guilt her for leaving for college and blaming any problem you have on her relationship. Your parents' neglect is their own fault, not Mark's.\n\nMark didn't \"steal\" her from you guys, she doesn't belong to you. Brooke wanted to get some distance from her family and it sounds like it's probably the healthiest thing for her tbh.", "YTA not for simply not attending but for you using Mark as the scapegoat to all your life issues.  You were under 10 when they got together.  Time to let the tantrum go and grow up.  We all need  be accountable for our words and actions.  Sounds like your sister was the typical teen.", "INFO - Brooke was 16 when you were a small child.  Your parents seemed to have been the ones that punished you for whatever she was doing at that time.  It is weird at that younger age to have all of those feelings, and go thru all of those thoughts without your parents putting all of that stuff in your head.  Have you talked to Brooke about it.  It seems there is probably a lot here that you didn't quite understand at the time, that built into anger for them.  I feel like there is so much more to this story.", "I think you're being childish and petty over stupid shit. I think it's insane that one of your examples is she wasn't eating at home as often.\n\nFrankly you are blaming your sister for shit you aren't entitled to. You failed math. No one else made you do that.\n\nYour parents sound just as immature. Why aren't you blaming them for creating a toxic home life?  Why aren't you mad at them you had to take care of your younger sister? She's their child!\n\nThe way you talk it's like you feel ownership over her instead of being an individual. It's weird. \n\nIt's like grow up and get over it. Jesus. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYour are blaming the wrong people here. None of this was on Brooke or Mark. This was your parents and your parents alone.\n\nFirst, it sounds like Brooke was being a normal teenager. It\u2019s normal to spend more time with friends and boyfriends as you hit your teenage years. And her pushing back on your parents rules and even your parent\u2019s religion is all very normal teenage behaviour. It sounds like your parents were quite strict/demanding and that makes any push back all that much harder.\n\nSecond, your parents are responsible for the stress in your house redirect on you in a way that meant you were neglected. You were just a child and should have been cared for and given attention regardless of what was going on with your sister. The fact your clothes weren\u2019t being cleaned because of this is on your parents and your parents alone.\n\nYou really should look into therapy. It sounds like you have a lot of understandable anger about your childhood but are putting it all in the wrong place.", "Wait, so your high school aged sister got a boyfriend, with whom she socialized, and it fucked your parents up so much that they *stopped caring for the rest of their children*? That\u2019s abuse. Your parents abused you, according to your post. And you\u2019re angry at your sister for escaping that situation? \n\nI think you need to take a big step back from all of this until you can look at the situation objectively. It honestly sounds like you\u2019re angry at your sister for acting her age, and because your parents abused you, you blame her for problems that she\u2019s obviously not responsible for causing. It sounds like you\u2019ve experienced a lot of pain from all of this. I\u2019m sorry for that. I think you should talk to someone about this. Someone who can help you break down and reorganize your thoughts. YWBTA if you hurt your sister out of spite because of your messed up childhood.", "YTA. You need to grow up and take your blinders off. \n\nYour sister behaved like an average person with a boyfriend. Your parents were overly controlling and reactive. Your sister and Mark didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Your negative childhood experiences are solely the fault of your parents.", "What I get from your post is that your parents tried to impose \"my way or the highway\" to your sister and she had a backbone, so it exploded in fights at home. But your parents are the adults, not your sister (at the time). The dysfunction is more due to their choices and actions, and less to hers, and not at all to her boyfriend's actions.\n\nInstead of having supper everyday at home, it was 4 or 5 times a week and your parents managed to blow up the household over that? To what end?\n\nWhy do you blame the fianc\u00e9 for this and not your parents?\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  \n\n\njust don't go, don't blame the other guy, also its sounds like all he did was help your sister gain independence potentally from overly strict parents .  \n\n\nthere is nothing wrong with going out with friends multiple nights a week", "Soooo\u2026. Your parents have basically neglected you and your little sister because they were fighting with their eldest and you blame her boyfriend? Wow.\n\nHe didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d your sister from her family. He didn\u2019t force her to fight with your parents - they created an unhealthy environment and made her choose. \n\nYTA. But sorry for you shitty childhood, you deserved better.", "Whether you go to the wedding or not doesn\u2019t really matter. \n\nWhat matters here is that your parents here have been terrible parents to all 3 of you! As an adult you should realize that by now. Your teenage sister should not have had to be like a parent to you. They got so mad at her about not being home for supper every day that it caused you to fail 4th grade\u2026 like seriously wtf were they doing. It sounds like they had really unreasonable expectations of your sister and she did what any normal teenager would do and pushed back. The fact that your parents let that situation get so toxic that you failed 4th grade is not your sisters fault or her boyfriends fault. YOUR PARENTS were the adults. YOUR PARENTS were responsible for you and helping you succeed at school. YOUR PARENTS created a toxic environment. YOUR PARENTS are the ones who failed. \n\nI grew up in a very happy family and also moved away to go to college. This is a totally normal thing to do. Blaming a boyfriend for stealing your sister away is not normal. \n\nI\u2019m honestly surprised anyone in your family was even invited to that wedding. Everything you wrote in this post makes you sound like an AH, but the real assholes are your parents who blame their own failures on teenagers.", "YTA.\n\nMark didn't \"steal\" her from you.  Your sister made choices.  And your parents also made poor choices by ignoring you and your sister.", "YTA, not for missing the wedding, that\u2019s your choice, but your sister and mark are not responsible for any of these issues, and honestly Brooke sounds like a normal teenager with a boyfriend,", "If you really don't support the wedding, don't go. But also, don't be surprised if Brooke considers this a massive betrayal and your relationship with her becomes even more fraught to non existent. And the only person to blame there would be you. \n\nHowever, you need therapy to get over these issues because you're clearly carrying trauma from that time and you're misdirecting the blame. Brooke and Mark were doing common teenaged stuff. \n\nBut overall, YWBTA because you're blaming the wrong people for this mess.", "YTA\n\nYou have not given a single valid reason for hating Mark. \n\nBrooke was a teen who wanted to spend time with her boyfriend. She still ate at home 4 to 5 nights a week. That wasn't good enough for your parents. They caused the tension. Not Brooke. Not Mark. \n\nAlso, plenty of people move far away from home for college. Maybe Brooke wanted to follow Mark. Or maybe she wanted space from your parents. Ultimately, it doesn't matter why she went to the college she did. She's allowed to live her life how she sees fit. \n\nIf you really don't want to go to the wedding, that's on you. But if you want a relationship with Brooke, skipping the wedding will put that in jeopardy.", "YTA. Your parents are the ones who did something wrong here, not Brooke or Mark.", "You\u2019re TA, you guys treat him like he\u2019s a horrible guy because your sister made decisions on her own, but you blame him for her decisions, so of course he glares at you all, because he\u2019s constantly been blamed for decisions that were your sisters choice or his, he didn\u2019t force her to do anything. He didn\u2019t take her away from you, you guys don\u2019t own her, she has her own life.\n\nAnd supportive and go to the wedding, act like her family not her owners for once.\n\nBlaming mark for everything that wasn\u2019t his fault or choice, grow up, apologise to mark for blaming him for things other people did, your sister and parents, stop acting like you\u2019re still 5 with the whole \u201che stole her from us\u201d she\u2019s not your property, she has to have her own life and not be in her families pocket forever, it isn\u2019t Marks fault your parents acted how they did towards you, or your sister acted as she did and not his fault you were bullied.\n\nQuit blaming Mark, that guys the only victim here, been blamed because he fell In Love with your sister and you guys are jealous of him for that.. your her family not her life partners, you shouldn\u2019t be jealous of her partner. Your family sounds toxic, maybe that\u2019s why she stayed away, not because of Mark but because your families toxic.

Also why would Brooke spending more time equate to your parents not packing your younger sisters lunch? You should never of been doing that. I see nothing wrong with how Brooke or Mark acted but I am concerned with how your parents acted. Would they do the same thing if you were in a relationship? Might be a question worth exploring. I would go and support your Sister and Mark. Once those blinders come off you may need them.", "INFO: Are you in therapy to unpack any of this? This reads like abandonment and neglect were a running theme for most of your childhood between your sister and parents.

Sounds like Mark got Brooke out of a toxic home and he can\u2019t stand your parents for good reason.", "YTA, I feel bad for Brooke and Mark. Why are Brooke and Mark the scapegoats? You and your parents are responsible for you failing 4th grade. I'm surprised Brooke has contact with you or your parents.", "Your being very immature. Your sister behaved normally in trying to find autonomy and agency as a teenager. She wanted to hang out with him and her friends a lot. That\u2019s also normal. Going out 2-3 nights a week with her boyfriend is not abnormal or strange. You are blaming her for a lot of things that in reality just aren\u2019t her fault. It makes sense that when she moved away for college that she went low contact with your controlling parents. Why would she come home for Christmas in that toxic environment? \n\nHe didn\u2019t steal her from you. Your parents pushed her away by trying to control her every move.

You were a little kid and she was a teenager, of course you weren't the center of her world because SHE IS YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOUR MOMMY! \n\nYou then blame Brook for your failing math. What the hell does she have to do with your ability to succeed academically? You blame Brooke for your younger sister struggling academically and socially. Again: SHE IS YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOUR MOMMY! \n\nYou are upset that your sister went to college across the country. That is pretty normal behavior. Not coming home at all during college isn't, and it makes me question what was the real problem. I noticed that you don't mention anything about your parents other than them having some arbitrary rule about dinner and Mark obviously not liking them. You also don't mention even trying to make an effort to get to know Mark. You say that he glared at your parents, do you think it may be because they may be the problem?", "I genuinely don\u2019t understand how your sister eating dinner somewhere else a few times a week was such a big deal that it derailed your entire life.

Outrageous.\n\nIn all seriousness, grow the fuck up, Brooke deciding to have dinner with her boyfriend some nights is perfectly normal and your parents were ridiculous, and them caring more about that than you having clean clothes or passing math is not Brookes nor her fiance's fault. \nMoving to another country was Brooke's decision, and no wonder she wanted to get away from your parents toxicity, you keep blaming Mark for choices your sister made.\n\nFrankly, I think you shouldn't go to the wedding, they don't need your bullshit.", "YTA.

Everything \u201cwrong\u201d you described your sister doing was normal teenager things. Your sister isn\u2019t your parent and she will never be your parent and cannot be held accountable to the failures of your actual parents. Last thing, it seems like your sister inviting you to her wedding is her way of slowly inviting you back into her life. If you don\u2019t go or go with this bitter grudge that could potentially ruin your relationship for decades if not life because this wedding is a big deal. Food for thought, you\u2019re both adults but with everything your family has put her through I think you\u2019re lucky she\u2019s even inviting you.", "So you had a bad home situation and your sister found a way to get out of it and you\u2019re blaming her boyfriend for it? Yeah, YTA.

Maybe your family situation didn\u2019t help, but hell, that\u2019s nowhere near his fault)", "I have to say YWBTA. You haven't given any examples of Brooke or her fianc\u00e9 doing anything malicious or harmful. They simply lived their lives as they chose. Your problems were not their fault.", "YTA. Is it possible your parents were controlling towards Brooke and she was actively trying to get away from them?", "YTA.You sound incredibly selfish and self-absorbed. Your sister wasn't home for dinner a few times a week so that ruined your childhood? Do you even realise how ridiculous you sound?Looks like Mark helped your sister set boundaries and get away from your parents who were parentifying her. If your parents didn't have the resources to have so many kids then they shouldn't have had so many kids. It's not Brooke's problem. Also calling your sister's fiance the guy who \"stole her\" from you? That's so weird and unhealthy.

You disagree with the wedding, you don't like it, you don't have to go. But whenever this kind of question comes up, I think it's important to ask yourself, imagine we are 10, 20, 30 years in the future. And they are still together. Would you want this decision to not attend a wedding, the decision to not put up with it for 1 day, to still cause a rift between you and them? It's their big day. They only have one of these in their relationship. Only one in their life, assuming they stay together, which considering how long they have been together seems likely. It's a small effort to attend, and if you don't it could have a big impact on your relationship with your sister.\n\nAgain, though, you aren't the asshole if you don't attend.

My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it. \n\nThe stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that. I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes. Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch, so she doesn\u2019t remember those years as negatively as I do. \n\nOf course, as soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college. Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn\u2019t come home over Christmas or summers. Eventually things cooled down when I was in high school and Brooke started making more contact with our family, but Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and suddenly declare that it was time for them to go. \n\nI don\u2019t think I should have to go to the wedding of my sister and this guy that stole her from us, and I am planning on RSVP-ing \u201cno\u201d when the time comes. Our family has been minimally involved in wedding planning, and I am not in the bridal party or anything like that (they are all friends of Brooke and Mark\u2019s from the hospital where they work).\n\nWIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am interested in learning more and growing more if Brooke is open to that.", "> I mean if Mark just wanted to take your sister and leave the country at 16 \n\nWhere the heck did you get that from? It says they moved *across the country* after high school graduation. The only assholes here are OP\u2019s parents, and OP needs to stop blaming her sister and Mark for their shitty parenting, otherwise she\u2019s an asshole too.", "Seems like you're therapeutic goal is to blame Mark for everything bad in your life. I understand your life has been difficult, but thats on your parents. I also guarantee that Mark probably did not have to do much convincing to get your sister to leave with him. Your home situation sounds terrible and she was probably happy to take the lifeline out of it.", "If their best was neglecting you, that\u2019s a low bar. \nIn other comments you say Brooke was your main caretaker because they had to work. That wasn\u2019t fair to Brooke and Mark saw that. \nYour parents are more to blame than Mark and Brooke. One of these couples were adults. The other was not. You seem stuck on continuing to view this from a childhood perspective.", ">I have tried going to other therapists in the past but they were not respectful of my therapeutic goals,\n\nHuh? You mean they aren't telling you what you want to hear and challenge you to question how good your parents actually were, and you get pissed I bet.", "Out of curiosity, what are your therapeutic goals and how have these other therapists not respected them?\n\nGlad to see this thread has helped you and you gained some valuable insight moving forward. As children we all experience things a certain way and sometimes we need to update our child selves on what actually happened and you are on your way! Good luck", "It\u2019s not marks fault either I can assure you as hard as it may be to hear Brooke had enough of being forced to look after you and didn\u2019t want to be your support system, and willingly wanted to spend time with him away from you and your family- he was a way out for her and SHE made the decision not him\n\n\nShe probably complained about it to him and how toxic the environment was hence why he hasn\u2019t always been super welcoming to all of you because he cares about her and her well-being \n\nEdit to add: YTA hugely I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re an adult and still think this way", "Just like you said, Brooke was a teenager, it was not her responsibility to support you and made sure you passed math, it was your parent's and they neglected you. \n\nI'm glad you're open to growth, but in this post you hold a lot of misplaced resentment towards Brooke and Mark, and you blame them for a lot of things while excusing your parents. Until you acknowledge that I don't think you can truly change.", "Part of that is getting over your self-righteous indignation and jealousy issues with Mark, they're 100% misplaced feelings and the part of you that you fight to keep down knows it", "[removed]", "I was trying to determine why the parents treated Mark so poorly, resulting in the 8 year old child getting the shitty end of the stick.  It is pretty obvious the parents are assholes, but Op probably didn't want to directly hear that.  I was saying if my daughter was 16 and she came in the house and was like I'm moving to Canada, ya I would have a problem with mark, that was what I was getting out with that statement.  Def not siding with them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They were parentifying Brooke and got mad when she wanted her own life.  As a consequence no one was parenting the two younger ones. This is 100% on the parents.", "They didn't move to a different country.  They just moved across the country.  In the US, that could mean from Florida to NY, or from NY to California.  And they didn't move when the sister was 16 - that's when they started dating.  They moved after high school graduation, to go to university/college.  That's well within the normal range of things for a teenager to do.  Going to college is healthy, responsible, and looking out for one's own future.\n\nI suspect the parents were mad because they were losing their free babysitter.  They might (horror!) have to take care of their younger two kids themselves!  And rather than working out an appropriate care plan for the younger two, they just neglected them, and blamed the neglect on the older sister being a normal, reasonably responsible, teenager.  \n\nFrom OP's perspective, who was used to the older sister providing care, the absence of the older sister had been masking the parents neglect, and when the older sister left, the mask was taken off.  But the mask felt \"normal\" in terms of care, and OP didn't see that it was the parents neglecting all three children, and rather blamed the sister for removing that mask, and OP having to deal with the parents' neglect directly.", "Awe, that is really sad, I didn't see that portion.  :(", "I understood all of that, I was saying that is a reason I would dislike my 16 year old daughters new boyfriend, I know they moved when they were 18 after graduating to go to college.", "It is. It also makes total sense why OP felt so abandoned and resented Mark even though it\u2019s misplaced. Therapy is in order I think.", "She already mentioned her therapist."]}
