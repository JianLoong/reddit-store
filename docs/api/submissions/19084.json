It looks like at some point they realized they didn't have it - and messaged you asking if you had it.  And then you admit to using it.\n\nYou are absolutely TA here.  \n\nNow, had you reached out to your ex about it - and they ignored you - and then you used it?  Different story.  But you did no such thing here.", "YTA because you said the two of you are still discussing the things left at your place.  So this isn't abandoned property, this is stuff you were arranging the return of, and skimmed off the top.", "Yta if you already gifted it to them.

And the ex no longer gets to yell at/abuse OP, they are no longer in a relationship.   They can be mad on their own time.", "Right, but the way I see it those were their things that they paid for. This was an unused gift that I paid for. I\u2019m not keeping anything that they spent money on or that we didn\u2019t discuss beforehand", "Why?  So they can spend another $60 to feel devalued by someone they have no relationship with?", "I genuinely don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve given it to anybody or used it themselves. If anything they would\u2019ve forgotten about it again and have it go to waste. That\u2019s just how I feel from knowing them, though.

What did they expect, really.", "Have you returned the last birthday gift they got you?", "If you gave it to them, it's theirs.  If it's theirs, it's not yours.

The fact that you think its important what you think they'd like do makes yta.\n\nThey didn't forget about it so again your thoughts about it are irrelevant and according to yourself absolutely wrong.\n\nSo yes YTA. Yes you stole their gift.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s my thinking though that if they didn\u2019t use it for over 6 months even when we were together, they weren\u2019t going to any time soon, and another month or two wouldn\u2019t really make a difference in the grand scheme of things", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.

Second, a friend did not leave this in her car. Her ex, who clearly did not value the gift because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to take it with them or use it for 6 months, left it behind.  Not even similar.", "That's what you tell yourself since you do not having any friends eh? Sad.", "I have plenty of friends, troll.

It'd been six months, that was entirely abandoned property and clearly not a priority for them.

What a weirdo, I can assume you are no longer in contact with them.", "Stop sharing information....its just adding drama\nDo you still have......no, click", "YTA. It was a gift and literally any other situation it makes no sense. Just because it was a piece of paper doesn\u2019t make it less of a gift. The moment you \u201cgave\u201d them the gift, it\u2019s theirs. It was accidentally left in your car, and instead of letting them know, you say nothing and use it. And literally 6 weeks later, which isn\u2019t a long time, you use it. You just want to be petty about the whole situation. You guys still message about stuff that\u2019s not yours, so it\u2019s not super unexpected. And I just had my roommate who moved out 4 weeks ago message about some stuff they may have possibly left, I gave it back. Because it\u2019s not fucking mine and I\u2019m not an asshole", "YTA. \nA gift is a gift and once given doesn\u2019t belong to\nYou anymore. You can be angry that they don\u2019t use it, and you can ask them if you can use it if they don\u2019t want it. BUT YOU CANT NUST TAKE IT. your ex is right. This is stealing. It belonged to your ex.", "Very smart of you to purposely omit genders. The post and the situation sounds like you're female and thus most votes are NTA.

And unless you want to get back with them, why are you even in contact?\n\nThere's no need to be amicable on birthdays or wish for festivals. Move on with life.", "YTA. Sounds like they still have stuff at your place. The correct thing to do would have been to add that to the pile of whatever they had left and ensure they collect it asap", "I\u2019m going with YTA but it also isn\u2019t really that big of a deal? He will be ok", "No it's not and you know it's not if he had a left his PS5 at her house and he didn't come get it for 6 months and he showed up on the 7th month and asked for his PS5 does that mean that it belongs to his ex-girlfriend no and he would be screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs about give me back my f****** video game. The fact that it was only $60 it was still hers because when you found it in the car you could have called her and mailed it to her we still have a postal system you are the a****** I don't give a f*** if you downvote me", "Oh please. Bore someone else with your totally unrelated issues.", "Maybe pick a comparison that isn't widely different dude? PS5's don't have an expiry or used by date, you buy it and you're done, it's yours to use whenever until it breaks or you get rid of it. Gift cards/certificates do (usually 6 - 12 months), so there was a high chance this money would have gone to waste if OP hadn't used it. I'm not spending $60 on a gift voucher just for it to expire because my ex hadn't got around to using it in time. \n\nAnd even then, I'd still feel the same way if it was a PS5 - you took too long, bad luck. 6 months is ample time to organise or even mention items you've left behind that you'd like to retrieve. \n\nIf it was such a big deal, the ex would have remembered it and asked about it before 6+ months have gone past.", "If the GF bought the PS5, then it most certainly would be hers. That is the situation here, he bought the gift, she left it with him, and he used it. NTA.", "It doesn\u2019t matter who paid for it. It was their property and not yours. Stop trying to justify theft.", "Where do you live because I live in New York City and the gift card certificates here basically don't have an expiration date maybe the certificate still but the gift cards you can use them up to 5 years and regardless it still belongs to her what part and who the f*** said I was a dude", "You know good and damn well that is not how it works but I'm not going to argue with you cuz . Because we would be having a conversation and she would not like what I was saying when I was trying to retrieve my property he gave her a birthday gift regardless how long it took her to use it regardless that she left it there it was still hers the fact that he brought it doesn't mean s***. He used it because they broke up if they were still together he would have never done that he's an a******", "First of all, calm your tits. I'm not calling you a dude, it can be used to refer to anyone despite what's going on between their legs. \n\nYes, that's why I said usually. The rules on gift cards & certificates differ from state to state but most allow for a no expiry date or a 5 year expiry date. I'm talking about the federal legislation (gift card act 2009) because most states have enacted legislation that is in line with the federal one.\n\nNow the important definition is a gift certificate or gift card is prepaid **in a specified amount**. OP says this card was for a massage package (which is valued at $60 because he paid $60 for it). That means no specific value, he can only redeem the card to receive those specific massages and nothing else. This law doesn't apply and massage vouchers are usually on good for a specific time. \n\nIf the gift card was for $60 which is redeemable at X massage place, that would be a specific amount. The federal gift card expiry law would apply then. See the difference?", "It...is how it works here though. You can't claim that he broke some kind of societal norm when everyone is agreeing with him. You might not like that it works like that but it doesn't change the reality.", "Wow.  There\u2019s a lot of anger here.  It\u2019s a gift certificate.  They broke up.  I\u2019m sorry if this is somehow triggering for you, but I\u2019m thinking a Reddit break and maybe therapy.  It sounds as if this brought up something unresolved in your life.", "Just answer one question. Did the certificate belong you you? Did you own it or did you transfer ownership by gifting it to your ex. You know the answer and you know that YTA. \nYou are just here trying to justify your action.", "We totally support you, this is not a big deal, I'm glad you used the gifts, and please don't feel bad about it.\n\nNTA", "Did you miss the part OP still has other stuff of theirs? Should she not give that back either because after two months it\u2019s considered as abandoned and not important?"]}
