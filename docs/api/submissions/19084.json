Bore someone else with your totally unrelated issues.", "Maybe pick a comparison that isn't widely different dude? PS5's don't have an expiry or used by date, you buy it and you're done, it's yours to use whenever until it breaks or you get rid of it. Gift cards/certificates do (usually 6 - 12 months), so there was a high chance this money would have gone to waste if OP hadn't used it. I'm not spending $60 on a gift voucher just for it to expire because my ex hadn't got around to using it in time. \n\nAnd even then, I'd still feel the same way if it was a PS5 - you took too long, bad luck. 6 months is ample time to organise or even mention items you've left behind that you'd like to retrieve. \n\nIf it was such a big deal, the ex would have remembered it and asked about it before 6+ months have gone past.", "If the GF bought the PS5, then it most certainly would be hers. That is the situation here, he bought the gift, she left it with him, and he used it. NTA.", "It doesn\u2019t matter who paid for it. It was their property and not yours. Stop trying to justify theft.", "Where do you live because I live in New York City and the gift card certificates here basically don't have an expiration date maybe the certificate still but the gift cards you can use them up to 5 years and regardless it still belongs to her what part and who the f*** said I was a dude", "You know good and damn well that is not how it works but I'm not going to argue with you cuz . Because we would be having a conversation and she would not like what I was saying when I was trying to retrieve my property he gave her a birthday gift regardless how long it took her to use it regardless that she left it there it was still hers the fact that he brought it doesn't mean s***. He used it because they broke up if they were still together he would have never done that he's an a******", "First of all, calm your tits. I'm not calling you a dude, it can be used to refer to anyone despite what's going on between their legs. \n\nYes, that's why I said usually. The rules on gift cards & certificates differ from state to state but most allow for a no expiry date or a 5 year expiry date. I'm talking about the federal legislation (gift card act 2009) because most states have enacted legislation that is in line with the federal one.\n\nNow the important definition is a gift certificate or gift card is prepaid **in a specified amount**. OP says this card was for a massage package (which is valued at $60 because he paid $60 for it). That means no specific value, he can only redeem the card to receive those specific massages and nothing else. This law doesn't apply and massage vouchers are usually on good for a specific time. \n\nIf the gift card was for $60 which is redeemable at X massage place, that would be a specific amount. The federal gift card expiry law would apply then. See the difference?", "It...is how it works here though. You can't claim that he broke some kind of societal norm when everyone is agreeing with him. You might not like that it works like that but it doesn't change the reality.", "Wow.  There\u2019s a lot of anger here.  It\u2019s a gift certificate.  They broke up.  I\u2019m sorry if this is somehow triggering for you, but I\u2019m thinking a Reddit break and maybe therapy.  It sounds as if this brought up something unresolved in your life.", "Just answer one question. Did the certificate belong you you?

Should she not give that back either because after two months it\u2019s considered as abandoned and not important?", "NTA OP for the reason that you gave Ex the gift 6 months BEFORE the two of you broke up.  To me the fact that they forgot for 6+ months about a gift given to them when y'all was still in a relationship speaks that this person didn't actually care about the gift you'd given them.

I wouldn't waste any more energy thinking about it. You're using a gift certificate that you purchased  that you found in YOUR car, is entirely justified here. Doesn't matter that it used to be considered a gift for someone else.", "I'd argue NTA cause the ex is being so unncessarily whiny about something way in the past, but also yeah who gives a cow", "Or used it in the preceding 6 months.", "They are still exchanging stuff?", "Best answer, right here.", "This!!! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "They are still exchanging stuff\u2026\n\n> When we do talk it\u2019s mostly about what stuff of theirs is still at my place etc.\n\nPeople still own their property even after a breakup.", "They broke up 2 months ago and are still exchanging stuff.", "How do you know it's a \"he\".
