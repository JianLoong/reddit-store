They thought so little of it that they left it and had never used it.", "YTA.\n\nYou gave your ex a gift.  It looks like at some point they realized they didn't have it - and messaged you asking if you had it.  And then you admit to using it.\n\nYou are absolutely TA here.  \n\nNow, had you reached out to your ex about it - and they ignored you - and then you used it?  Different story.  But you did no such thing here.", "YTA because you said the two of you are still discussing the things left at your place.  So this isn't abandoned property, this is stuff you were arranging the return of, and skimmed off the top.", "Yta if you already gifted it to them. If you bought it and never got to give it to them you would be in the clear but since you actually gave it to them it wasn\u2019t yours to give.", "They didn\u2019t use it for 6 months and left it behind when you broke up and they moved an hour away. You\u2019re fine. Probably not quite as amicable anymore, but fine. NTA", "NTA", "NTA what\u2019s recently ? Either way a gift is a grey area and I would have assumed it was abandoned by they when they moved 6plus hours and didn\u2019t take it", "YTA. It was their bday gift at least offer to replace it. Call their bluff.", "ESH on a technicality here, him for making a big deal out of it and you for technically half inching something, just because it was a gift doesn't make it less his than if he bought it.", "YTA.  They might have wanted to give it to someone. \n\n>I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to take me to small claims court over 60 bucks lol. \n\nThis tells me you know it.", "YTA-  no you weren't justified.", "YTA. You gave them a gift. Even if you found it in your car, it belongs to them. You stole something from them. You could've ask if they still wanted it before using it but from the moment you gave it, it wasn't yours anymore.", "They left it, in your car for 6 months? And you broke up 2 months ago and now they want it? Yeah, no. NTA.", "NTA, if it meant so much they would have taken it. Snooze you loose", "NTA. They left it when they moved and had 6 months to call you about it.", "they got no strings on you. fuck em", "You didn't steal anything. They abandoned it.\n\nNta.", "NTA-", "The breakup was about two months ago, and I used it two weeks ago.

And the ex no longer gets to yell at/abuse OP, they are no longer in a relationship.   They can be mad on their own time.", "Right, but the way I see it those were their things that they paid for. This was an unused gift that I paid for. I\u2019m not keeping anything that they spent money on or that we didn\u2019t discuss beforehand", "Why?  So they can spend another $60 to feel devalued by someone they have no relationship with?", "I genuinely don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve given it to anybody or used it themselves. If anything they would\u2019ve forgotten about it again and have it go to waste. That\u2019s just how I feel from knowing them, though. Also that last line was kind of a joke more than anything lol", "I'd have waited longer, personally, but I'm still going with NTA on this one. What did they expect, really.", "Have you returned the last birthday gift they got you?", "If you gave it to them, it's theirs.  If it's theirs, it's not yours. Taking something that isn't yours without permission is stealing.  Did you not learn that in kindergarten?", "It was still their gift. YTA. Just because you paid for it doesn\u2019t make it less theirs once you gifted it to them.", "Leave your relationship out of it. It\u2019s about the gift.", "What you genuinely think is irrelevant. The fact that you think its important what you think they'd like do makes yta.\n\nThey didn't forget about it so again your thoughts about it are irrelevant and according to yourself absolutely wrong.\n\nSo yes YTA. Yes you stole their gift.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s my thinking though that if they didn\u2019t use it for over 6 months even when we were together, they weren\u2019t going to any time soon, and another month or two wouldn\u2019t really make a difference in the grand scheme of things", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.  Generally speaking, people don\u2019t give gifts in the absence of a relationship. So leaving the relationship out of it is kind of impossible.", "You can\u2019t steal abandoned property.", "That's not unreasonable. I'm surprised they blew up about it... I would think there are other more important issues to focus on.", "I wouldn't want to be friends with you. If I forget something at my friends house or in their car I don't expect them to keep it. I wouldn't be friends with an asshole like that.", "Assuming there\u2019s good reason they are no longer together.", "First, that\u2019s fine.  I\u2019m pretty picky about my friends, too.  Second, a friend did not leave this in her car. Her ex, who clearly did not value the gift because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to take it with them or use it for 6 months, left it behind.  Not even similar.", "That's what you tell yourself since you do not having any friends eh? Sad.", "I have plenty of friends, troll.  I just don\u2019t have abusive ones, like you.", "NTA\n\nIf they had wanted it they would have taken it.", "NTA", "NTA. It'd been six months, that was entirely abandoned property and clearly not a priority for them. Honestly, I'd have lied and said I had no idea where it was just to avoid drama, but you had no reason to believe they'd be so weird about it.", "NTA they left it.", "Now this made me laugh!!!", "JAH!"]}
