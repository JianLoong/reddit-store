I don't have any siblings. She has an older sister (Sarah - 30F)  and an older brother (Arthur - 32M). They each have a kid with their spouse.\n\nArthur's daughter, Daisy (8 Y/o), is freakishly similar to me. Even though I work most of the time, whenever we have her over, I try my best to bond with her and spend time with her. I am literally her favoirite aunty because we both like sports, cats, paperwork, and discussions. \n\nWe would sit together in my office, she'd paint and ask for my opinion while I did some of my work. We watch debates, sometimes she asks really smart legal queations and I gladly explaim everything to her (I'm a lawyer). We play with cats in the neighborhood and exercise together sometimes. My wife sometimes joins as well, but when I'm home, Daisy likes to spend time with me.\n\nNow Sarah's son, Ben (6 Y/o) is like a little earthquake. We have a lot of fragile decorative items at home. So we aren't really comfortable with the idea of having him over. Even when he comes over (which is rare) he would tire my wife and I out with all the energy he has. Simply, we don't spend as much time with him.\n\nWe were at Sarah's and Daisy was there too (to play with Ben). Ever since we arrived, Daisy ignired ben and wanted to sit with me. Sarah asked me why I didn't put in as much effort to befriend Ben and why I always preferred Daisy. I said I love them both but is Daisy reminded me of me and we understand each other better.\n\nVictoria also explained all of the similarities I had with Daisy and how even she felt left out despite being an aunt. Sarah accused me of being discriminative and sexist and said we should treat our niblings equally. \n\nI might be TA here because I said they are different individuals and they each should be treated differently based on their own characteristics. My wife agreed. Sarah called us both unbelievable. The conversation endes there but there is still a bit of awkwardness around us all. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: A few people have mentioned this and I wanted to clarify. I did try and take Ben outdoors for exercise or sports, both alone and with Daisy. He does not follow any rules, and randomly runs up to strangers to mess with them (like throwing water on them, scaring them, running on their stuff) and I found I can't really control him outside.", "created_utc": 1679577579, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zk6vn/aita_for_treating_my_niblings_differently/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Exhausting.\nNTA but you should keep trying.", "NTA I think everyone bonds with people including kids differently. \n\nPlus it\u2019s easier to babysit a kid that is calm and laid back verses one that is bouncing off the walls.  \n\nI am a firm believer your kid spending time at someone\u2019s house is a privilege not a mandatory requirement just because they are family.", "NTA.

I have to say, tho, that if your house isn't \"Ben safe\" you guys could do the effort of spending more time outside with him, if people are noticing the disparity in treatment, he'll eventually grow out of this phase and might resent you and your wife.\n\nWhat makes it a NTA situation is your sister in-law (is that what Ben's mother is to you? American family terminology gets way above my head) calling you sexist for spending more time with Daisy. I don't want to jump to conclusions (he says before doing so), but it seems a tad homophobic. There's nothing sexist about you bonding more with a nibling who happens to be the same gender as you.", "YTA - you blather on about all of Daisy's interests and didn't mention one thing that Ben is interested in.

You claim to like sports and you exercise with Daisy.  Why not take Ben outside and find out how he likes to burn that energy?  Get some washable paints and big paper and paint outside so you don't have to worry about the mess.  \n\nYour post really comes across egotistical.  Daisy is soooo like me, we have so much in common, I'm her favorite - me, me, me, me.  \"I try my best to bond with her\" and I ignore my nephew as that relationship isn't all about me.", "YTA It\u2019s wrong to encourage Daisy to ignore her cousin.

Ben is absolutely aware that you like him less than you like Daisy, and if he gets this reaction from multiple people over the course of time, it will have an effect on his self esteem and sense of worth.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being an energetic person, and Ben needs to see that he is worthy of love and attention as the person he is.

In *Pride and Prejudice* the aunt and uncle take Jane to London, not all 5 of them and only Lizzy to Derbyshire. You are right, children are individuals are should be treated as such to bring out what they enjoy most and are good at. That is treating children fairly, but not the same way.

It seems like being with Daisy gives you energy but being with Ben drains you. You shouldn\u2019t exhaust yourself so that Ben is \u2018equal\u2019 and you shouldn\u2019t push Daisy away to make things \u2018even\u2019.\n\nYour influence and bond with Daisy is probably going to be very important to her for the rest of her life. The same is not true for Ben (who hopefully has someone else that fits that sort of role).\n\nOf course you should still make an effort with Ben but you can\u2019t fake the kind of relationship you have with Daisy.", "I agree with a lot that you said, but I think saying that Bens mom is looking for a break is insinuating things. Nothing in the story said that unless I missed something?", "I should have added the word \"likely\", but yes, it's likely. Niece spends hours with OP. If Ben did too, one of the benefits is that the parents get a break. Not to be sneezed at if you have a six year old son.", ">*He does not follow any rules, and randomly runs up to strangers to mess with them (like throwing water on them, scaring them, running on their stuff) and I found I can't really control him outside*.\n\nThis edit confirms that Ben is a handful outside, and has a lot of growing up to do.  He likely needs firmer parenting, also.  \n\nIf he attends regular school he knows what acceptable behavior is, and chooses not to behave appropriately with OP.", "Lived through the Reseda Quake. This is very correct.", "Idk.. I think people are assuming that of OPs SIL based on other posts in this sub. I don't want my brothers to get along with my kids for free childcare and I think the people that *do* think like that aren't as common as this sub would make you think... at least I hope?", "This thread is wholesome as heck and that's so nice to see on this subreddit", "There are relatives who are just going to naturally closer or naturally not based on all kinds of things - interests, stage of life, introvert/extrovert, all kinds of things. Some people are just naturally on the same wavelength. They just are. Fact of life. Babies always gravitated to my father, for instance.\n\nTrying to force relationships is unwise, and we see that all the time. About the only exception to this is parents - parents need to give equivalent (which is not the same thing as equal or identical) attention and if they don't, they're assholes. Grandparents too, though there's a bit more flexibility there. I knew my one grandmother was especially close to her eldest granddaughter who lived near her. Didn't bother me, my grandmother always made a fuss over all her grandchildren.\n\nBut I think, fundamentally, Ben's mother is out of line. A more mature reaction would be, oh, isn't it nice OP has a special relationship with her niece. Let's try to find something like that for Ben, with someone who is naturally close to Ben's personality, whatever.\n\nSo, why is she insistent on equal time? I don't know, but in fact getting a break is one of the less dark reasons. Jealousy might be another, for instance.", "no. you asked why I hate it and I answered. I have only heard it recently and while I agree it has a meaning I find it a word that I dislike. I am not the only one who thinks it is not good apparently."]}
