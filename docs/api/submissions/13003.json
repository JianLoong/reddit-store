I don't have any siblings. She has an older sister (Sarah - 30F)  and an older brother (Arthur - 32M). They each have a kid with their spouse.\n\nArthur's daughter, Daisy (8 Y/o), is freakishly similar to me. Even though I work most of the time, whenever we have her over, I try my best to bond with her and spend time with her. I am literally her favoirite aunty because we both like sports, cats, paperwork, and discussions. \n\nWe would sit together in my office, she'd paint and ask for my opinion while I did some of my work. We watch debates, sometimes she asks really smart legal queations and I gladly explaim everything to her (I'm a lawyer). We play with cats in the neighborhood and exercise together sometimes. My wife sometimes joins as well, but when I'm home, Daisy likes to spend time with me.\n\nNow Sarah's son, Ben (6 Y/o) is like a little earthquake. We have a lot of fragile decorative items at home. So we aren't really comfortable with the idea of having him over. Even when he comes over (which is rare) he would tire my wife and I out with all the energy he has. Simply, we don't spend as much time with him.\n\nWe were at Sarah's and Daisy was there too (to play with Ben). Ever since we arrived, Daisy ignired ben and wanted to sit with me. Sarah asked me why I didn't put in as much effort to befriend Ben and why I always preferred Daisy. I said I love them both but is Daisy reminded me of me and we understand each other better.\n\nVictoria also explained all of the similarities I had with Daisy and how even she felt left out despite being an aunt. Sarah accused me of being discriminative and sexist and said we should treat our niblings equally. \n\nI might be TA here because I said they are different individuals and they each should be treated differently based on their own characteristics. My wife agreed. Sarah called us both unbelievable.

Maybe in group setting you could make more of an effort to treat them both the same and still have the one on one time with Daisy? \n\nAs a parent it's so hard to see your kid get left out, especially by family.. but that doesn't mean others have to make the effort to not leave them out. Especially if personalities don't click. But I understand Sarah's thoughts and don't think she's an AH here for being hurt. I also don't think you're an AH for having a favorite.. I just feel that I'm a group setting you could make more effort to treat them both the same and a lot of the problems in this situation would go away. So no one feels left out.", "Nta. I feel like it is generally hard to even find family members you get  along with. If you're personality with a person is incompatible that's okay. You don't need to be friends with everyone just be kind. Ben will be easier to handle when he's older, maybe then you can include him into activities and outings.", "NAH. You probably do put in the same effort with them right now, it\u2019s just that the relationship between you and Daisy effectively takes no effort (and gives you great emotional returns), which isn\u2019t the same for Ben. \n\nIt\u2019s also not unexpected that the others in the situation take issue with the wild disparity in how much time together you have with each. \n\nI strongly suggest trying to make the number of occasions or amount of time together a little closer than you do now by adapting YOUR time to what Ben needs for his personality and developmental stage. He won\u2019t be a whirlwind forever, but he (and the others in your family) will continue be able to resent that you didn\u2019t try to foster a relationship just because it wasn\u2019t effortless.", "NTA. Maybe she is just pissed she does not have access to a free sitter for a non well behaved kid, unlike Arthur who's daughter does not break things and share a lots of interest with you.", "NTA\n\nIt's definitely easier to bond with someone that you share similarities to. I am closer to my stepdaughter than I am my stepson, because her and I have more things in common, not because she is a girl.", "NTA - I\u2019ve had nieces and nephews that I\u2019ve loved, and others not so much. We all can\u2019t like everybody equally.", "I get it. He's boisterous. He sounds just like my nephew. He will settle down and get the hang of impulse control and inside vs outside activities eventually.\nMaybe try to engage with him in an interest he has, for the sake of bonding with him (which will be positive for both of you) and for the sake of keeping the peace.\nBut I wouldn't offer to care for him without his mum there if that's what she's angling for. Exhausting.\nNTA but you should keep trying.", "NTA I think everyone bonds with people including kids differently. \n\nPlus it\u2019s easier to babysit a kid that is calm and laid back verses one that is bouncing off the walls.  \n\nI am a firm believer your kid spending time at someone\u2019s house is a privilege not a mandatory requirement just because they are family.", "NTA. Not sexist and completely normal to bond with one child more than another. That being said, you are the aunties and maybe you could start to make an effort to spend time doing things Ben likes outside of your home and bring Daisy along so they can build their cousin bond. I grew up with all my cousins and while we\u2019re all vastly different, when we get together it feels like siblings, because of all the time we spent growing up together.", "NTA\n\nAlhough you probably shouldn't have said the quiet part out loud, it's expected to bond more with children that share some of your interests with you. I have to say, tho, that if your house isn't \"Ben safe\" you guys could do the effort of spending more time outside with him, if people are noticing the disparity in treatment, he'll eventually grow out of this phase and might resent you and your wife.\n\nWhat makes it a NTA situation is your sister in-law (is that what Ben's mother is to you? American family terminology gets way above my head) calling you sexist for spending more time with Daisy. I don't want to jump to conclusions (he says before doing so), but it seems a tad homophobic. There's nothing sexist about you bonding more with a nibling who happens to be the same gender as you.", "YTA - you blather on about all of Daisy's interests and didn't mention one thing that Ben is interested in.  Just that he is boisterous and an earthquake - if my aunts ignored me, I might have a lot of nervous energy too, and I might try and be a bit wild to get some attention.\n\n  Clearly you have put no effort in to get to know him, you just want to culture your little mini-me.  You claim to like sports and you exercise with Daisy.  Why not take Ben outside and find out how he likes to burn that energy?  Get some washable paints and big paper and paint outside so you don't have to worry about the mess.  \n\nYour post really comes across egotistical.  Daisy is soooo like me, we have so much in common, I'm her favorite - me, me, me, me.  \"I try my best to bond with her\" and I ignore my nephew as that relationship isn't all about me.", "YTA It\u2019s wrong to encourage Daisy to ignore her cousin. Yes it may take a little more effort to find common ground with Ben, but it\u2019s not fair to make him the odd man out in a group setting.", "Wtf is a nibbling.", "YTA. But because you have a favorite but because you openly expressed it. Some things you just don't say. How hard to just say, sure I'll try instead of grooming the older one you like to be more like you. Debates with an 8 year old. Laughable.", "NTA it's not your fault you have more in common with Daisy than with Ben", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH, but I would caution you that kids are very perceptive. Ben is absolutely aware that you like him less than you like Daisy, and if he gets this reaction from multiple people over the course of time, it will have an effect on his self esteem and sense of worth.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being an energetic person, and Ben needs to see that he is worthy of love and attention as the person he is.  While it isn\u2019t your job to raise him, you do seem to care about him; it would be worth your time for his sake to plan some time to go be energetic together in positive ways.", "NTA.

Those rules are not applied to niblings. Aunts and uncles have favourites and it is shown very commonly in a lot of Classic literature. In *Little Women* the aunt takes her favourite niece to study art in Paris, she leaves her house as inheritance to just one of her nieces Jo, not between all of them. In *Pride and Prejudice* the aunt and uncle take Jane to London, not all 5 of them and only Lizzy to Derbyshire. You are right, children are individuals are should be treated as such to bring out what they enjoy most and are good at. That is treating children fairly, but not the same way. The only issue would be a group setting, where one kid is ignored and the other getting lots of attention, or very unequal presents opened in front of each other,", "NAH - but you say you like sports and nephew has a lot of energy\u2026.so why aren\u2019t you seeing if you can take him to play x sport outside? He gets to run around, you  avoid him in your home, and you get to bond with him. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to be the kid who is obviously ignored or treated differently in the family.

It went a long way to establishing street cred with the kid and kid's parents.\n\nIf you can find something that makes Ben sit quietly, that's worthwhile too.

Of my little relatives, it\u2019s the personality type I find the most fun. Probably because I am definitely NOT like that and they give me a serotonin boost and I get a kick out of it. I think it IS sexist to assume that little boys are one way and little girls are another, though. And I didn\u2019t see OP imply gender had anything to do with her choices. She has a personality type she appreciates more and in her case that happens to belong to her niece.", "Which is fine, but my point was he hasn't broken anything and it shouldn't be said he does. \n\nOP connects with Daisy better than Ben and that's cool.
