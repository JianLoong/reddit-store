It was the last game of the school year and we happened to play against a pretty goated team. So I was already on my toes a little till I saw a newer girl on there team who had clear disability\u2019s. I\u2019m not too sure but she looked like had some kinda autism. \n\nI gave her the benefit of the doubt, because there team was pretty good. So I was guessing she must be too if she made the team. I guessed wrong though, this girl completely sucked. So the way I knew we\u2019d for sure we\u2019d win is if we constantly spiked near her. She couldn\u2019t block for shit so it was a for sure way we\u2019d win you know? \n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t the best thing to do morally, but it wasn\u2019t like we were cheating. And I really wanted to win this last game so that\u2019s what I did. Whenever I got the chance I\u2019d spike at her. No it didn\u2019t hit her I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d get benched if I did. But what it did do was win our last game of the season. \n\nThe thing is her mom ended up coming up to my coach and I basically saying I was purposely discriminating against her. By consistently targeting her over and over again. Both me and my coach told her I wasn\u2019t targeting her because of her disability but because she was the weakest player. She ended up storming off all salty because her kid sucked. \n\nI ended up telling a friend who wasn\u2019t on my team about the whole ordeal. Where she called me a huge douche basically saying if I knew she had a disability I should\u2019ve been less hard on her. To where I told her that would\u2019ve been 10 times worse if I just let her win because she has a disability and she should be treated like every other player despite her disability. She obviously disagreed and wanted me to post here.

You are playing a *competitive* sport. You are *competing*. The goal is to win.

Your coach was correct, your team was targeting the weakest player, not because she had a disability. It's a competition (play to win). I feel like it'd be a disservice to every other player if you were to hold back.", "So, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't targeting the weakest player(s) on the team pretty normal?

Opposing coach\u2019s fault.", "NTA. If this is a competitive league then fair game.\n\nMaybe the opposition coach could've spoken to your coach before about it, but only if this game had no importance.

During the championship match she had obscene cramps in every muscle in her legs during a play. She was on the ground in the back of the court in the middle of a play. Once she recovered even she said that the opponent was dumb for not targeting her. As in most team sports, the smart thing to do is target the weakest player. NTA, and truthfully I\u2019d say even if you did hit her in the face still NTA because it happens to all of us who play competitive volleyball. \n\nAnd I\u2019m guessing her mother\u2019s attitude has something to do with her being on the team in the first place", "NTA for spiking it at her over and over because she was the weakest player, that's just strategy regardless of whether anyone is disabled or not. There's not really accommodations in sports just because you suck at them, especially in junior varsity. But YTA for saying that she \"looked like she had some kinda autism.\" That's just...no.", "If you played within the rules of the game (I've played many sports but never volleyball, even casually) I see no issue here. It would be like my hockey forwards not taking shots on the goalie's glove side because they've noticed he's weak top-shelf there.

The weakest link was always a Target.", "NTA, it's a competition, and in competition, we exploit weaknesses. She sucked. You used it to your advantage.

This win at any cost mentality, especially at a JV level is disappointing.
