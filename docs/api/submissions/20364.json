I\u2019m not too sure but she looked like had some kinda autism. \n\nI gave her the benefit of the doubt, because there team was pretty good. So I was guessing she must be too if she made the team. I guessed wrong though, this girl completely sucked. So the way I knew we\u2019d for sure we\u2019d win is if we constantly spiked near her. She couldn\u2019t block for shit so it was a for sure way we\u2019d win you know? \n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t the best thing to do morally, but it wasn\u2019t like we were cheating. And I really wanted to win this last game so that\u2019s what I did. Whenever I got the chance I\u2019d spike at her. No it didn\u2019t hit her I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d get benched if I did. But what it did do was win our last game of the season. \n\nThe thing is her mom ended up coming up to my coach and I basically saying I was purposely discriminating against her. By consistently targeting her over and over again. Both me and my coach told her I wasn\u2019t targeting her because of her disability but because she was the weakest player. She ended up storming off all salty because her kid sucked. \n\nI ended up telling a friend who wasn\u2019t on my team about the whole ordeal. Where she called me a huge douche basically saying if I knew she had a disability I should\u2019ve been less hard on her. To where I told her that would\u2019ve been 10 times worse if I just let her win because she has a disability and she should be treated like every other player despite her disability.

You\u2019re an asshole just for this comment. \n\nIncidentally: autism doesn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d anything. I\u2019d suggest a little special education for you.", "Autism doesn't affect someone's appearance, it's not a physical disability...\n\nSource: am autistic", "What do you call them then, like I\u2019m being genuine when I say I generally don\u2019t know how I\u2019m being a dick. Autism is Neuro divergent n those are the sped kids Neuro typical is the ones without autism. Right?", "Hey, I\u2019m autistic and it sounds like you\u2019re genuinely not educated on this stuff, so I\u2019ll throw out some info\u2014\n\nYou\u2019re correct that autism is classified as neurodivergence, and that non-neurodivergent people are classified as neurotypical. However, \u201cneurodivergent\u201d is like an umbrella, under which autism falls; people with ADHD are also neurodivergent, for example. It just means that our brains process information differently than the societal norm. \n\nAutism doesn\u2019t cause a specific \u201clook;\u201d some conditions, usually chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome, have specific phenotype differences associated with them, but not all people with say a small chin have Down\u2019s. When that happens it\u2019s because the genes expressed affect physical appearance AND development, so the phenotype isn\u2019t *causing* any developmental delays. \n\nAutism is a spectrum that incorporates things like communication and sensory processing, among others. Not every autistic person presents the same symptoms (there\u2019s a saying in the community that if you\u2019ve met one autistic person, you\u2019ve met *one* autistic person).For example, I might have difficulty maintaining regular eye contact or interpreting a person\u2019s body language, understanding idioms, or be intolerant of bright lights and loud noises. Meanwhile someone with higher support needs may not be able to speak and have difficulty with language development, as well as self care activities like toileting, feeding, or hygiene. There\u2019s a broad range of presentations, and every autistic person has different needs. \n\nAs far as the language you\u2019re using\u2014\u201csped kids\u201d may feel like useful shorthand when referring to the special education class as a whole, but in general we all have such differing needs and abilities that it comes across as quite crass. We face discrimination based off of our disabilities (\u201cableism\u201d) every day, and \u201csped kids\u201d is another way that your fellow students are othered. You may have heard of the term \u201cmicroaggresions\u201d in terms of racism or homophobia? That applies here as well, it\u2019s a \u201cdeath by 1000 papercuts\u201d kind of thing. We face incorrect information and assumptions based on our disabilities and differences, being made to feel like we\u2019re inconveniencing others just for existing, comments alluding to both our worth/lack of it and that of others like us, every day\u2014one off color comment might seem like not a big deal, but it piles up when faced with them by an uncountable number of people over weeks, months, and years. \n\nAnyway, hope this helps! I really do hope that you\u2019re open to learning this kind of stuff, and feel free to ask me any genuine follow up questions you may have, I do LGBTQ+ and neurodivergent education for a living lol. \n\n(Also, re: the OP: NTA, competitive games require competitive tactics)", "Why do you have to call them anything? You have no idea what this kids diagnosis is, autism doesn\u2019t have a look. Google autistic celebrities, tell me if you could identify a single one of them as autistic by the way they look. \n\nStop saying \u201csped\u201d as a pejorative, you sound like a dick. Most autistic kids are fully integrated anyway. Schools don\u2019t have funding to give every neurodivergent kid a separate class. \n\nNeurodivergent covers more than just autism. I have ADHD, I am neurodivergent \u2014 and I promise you couldn\u2019t tell that by looking at me either since I didn\u2019t get a diagnosis til I was 40. \n\nAnyway. I\u2019m not here to educate you. You\u2019ve got Google, use it. And stop thinking that neurodivergent kids are less than you in any way.", "I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you just lack education in this topic. \n\nGenerally speaking, referring to someone as a \"special ed kid\" is wrong because not everyone with a learning disability is in a special education program. Some start out in one, but then learn skills needed to enter mainstream classes. Others are able to be in mainstream classes from the start. \n\nNeurodivergence can refer to autism, but it can also refer to dyslexia, ADHD, down's syndrome, and a number of other disabilities. Even within these disabilities the severity varies between individuals. \n\nSome people use \"on the spectrum\", but personally I'm not a fan of that one.", "Tbf, if you tell OP to just look info up on the internet without referring them to articles that contain the info you want them to learn then don't be surprised when they still have a viewpoint that you don't agree with... just bc you used a more elaborate version of \"educate yourself\", doesn't mean it's not just as pointless.", "If it\u2019s a friendly game then Y T A but it sounds like these are competitive games in a league and possibly with outcomes dependent on performance.
