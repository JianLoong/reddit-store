Well, a friend of his family (I'll call her Anna, 58F) always comes to spend the holidays here, so, since she's a friend of my boyfriend's family, I decided to be friendly and invite her for lunch. Anna didn't seem to want much contact with me, so our lunch ended up not happening. My boyfriend said that she probably acted like that because she's not that close of a friend to his family. Things got weird when Anna found out that my boyfriend was coming to our country, she started sending me a lot of messages trying to arrange a dinner together, I said I would let my boyfriend decide as it would be his first trip abroad and we had already planned our schedule.  With a week to go before my boyfriend arrived, Anna texted me every day, asking which airport he was coming to, flight times, and who would pick him up at the airport. I explained that I would pick it up and gave her the information she asked for. However, my patience was already running out, as she asked the same questions again and again. I had to ask my boyfriend if he wanted Anna to pick him up from the airport. My boyfriend just said he would talk to Anna privately and sort it out.  This same week, my boyfriend warned Anna that we wouldn't have time for dinner, because Anna lives practically an hour from my house, and my boyfriend and I don't feel comfortable driving at night, especially in a dangerous area. So Anna texted me w the same invite, I was surprised since my boyfriend had already spoken to her, of course, I politely declined. Finally, my boyfriend arrives in our country, and as soon as we get in the car to go home, Anna texted asking if we want to go straight to her house, we politely declined. At this point, I was super uncomfortable w her insisting.  It didn't take long for Anna to text us every day, asking if we could have lunch, we ended up accepting after so much insistence, and scheduled to go on a Tuesday.  On Monday, Anna canceled and said she was helping her son with something, and insisted that we go there for dinner, my boyfriend thanked us for the invitation but said that we already had plans for the night, Anna was very hurt and said \"well, I tried\".  I already knew that at any moment she would text me, so it happened, she was always drier with me, but on that occasion, she was being passive-aggressive, she expected me to solve everything. I politely thanked the dinner invite and again said we weren't going. We even talked to my mother-in-law, who was surprised by Anna's behavior. The next day, I woke up with a message from Anna asking if we could make a video call in the afternoon or evening, but honestly, at this point, I'm tired of being polite, her insistence and behavior is almost out of line, I decided to don\u2019t reply anymore, at least not today. Am I being an asshole for finding Anna's behavior strange and not wanting to talk to her anymore?\n\nEdit 1: Anna texted me first, that\u2019s why I have her number. She\u2019s not a close friend of the family but still a friend. When I suggested the first lunch, was trying to be friendly since she\u2019s visiting my country.\nEdit 2: You guys are very creative but my bf never had anything with Anna LOL.", "created_utc": 1678800011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r5x7u/aita_for_losing_patience_with_a_friend_of_my/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Focus on spending time with your bf.", ">On Monday, Anna canceled and said she was helping her son with something, and insisted that we go there for dinner, my boyfriend thanked us for the invitation but said that we already had plans for the night, Anna was very hurt and said \"well, I tried\".\n\nShe expects you to drop whatever plans you have for her and gets huffy when you don't. What an exhausting person. There's no pleasing such people. I'd drop this hot potato and never look back.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Also, I really tried to understand this behavior but it's really weird... If even the family who is closer with her doesn't get it, I don't believe you could as well.

Have a nice week!\u201d Then phone off!", "NTA\n\nShe seems like a handful I would just stop replying to her as well especially since you don't want to talk to her, the age between Anna and yourself also adds to the strange nature of her behavior.", "NTA. The obsessive vibes I'm getting from this post is off the charts. I can't decide if it's Mrs. Robinson vibes or mother-substitution vibes. Either way, block her and enjoy your time with your boyfriend.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re right to feel frustrated. She\u2019s being very disrespectful to both you and your boyfriend. You\u2019ve said \u2018no\u2019 multiple times already, which you can because you don\u2019t owe her anything. \n\nAfter you tried to have lunch with her, she made other plans and wanted you to throw away yours by going to dinner, even knowing that you and your boyfriend had a tight schedule. \n\nAnna\u2019s behaviour is odd. I admire your patience, OP.", "nta\n\nturn off your phone and enjoy your time.", "NTA\n\nShe seems really pushy about this whole thing. \n\nTruthfully, the obsessive way she\u2019s trying to get you to come to her house at night is what\u2019s not sitting right with me (and I truthfully don\u2019t know why it\u2019s setting off alarm bells for me). Lunch/day plans she insisted and then canceled and she countered with dinner/night plans again. Even though you both have repeatedly refused any night plans. Maybe I\u2019ve watched too many movies, but I swear it feels as though she\u2019s trying to lure you into what you called a dangerous area at night. Again, probably just my overactive imagination, but I can\u2019t figure out what her obsessive need to have you there at dinner is all about. Especially because she\u2019s not a close family friend. \n\nI\u2019d just ignore your phones or block her. Maybe explain this all to his parents and that she just won\u2019t stop contacting you so she doesn\u2019t contact them in an attempt to get to you two.", "NTA. But why do you even have her number and why haven't you blocked her already,  leave your boyfriend to handle it, she's his family's friend, not yours.", "Nta and it seems that she is obsessed with your boyfriend for some reason", "NTA you were very accommodating of her and too polite for what she deserved. You tried to get the plan going and the \"friend\" just kept making it more difficult to the point it looks like she wanted it to fail from the beginning.", "INFO: First you said she is his family's friend but then your boyfriend said Anna is not a friend of the family. Then u said he is your boyfriend but then u went on to call his mom your mother in law. \n\nWhat is the actual status of your relationship OP? I am so confused. And is this Anna a relative?", "ESH. Honestly I find it very strange that you ever even tried to contact her. You said yourself you boyfriend and you had never made the relationship official in person. Why are you involved with his not so close family friends at all? That seems so strange to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who gave her your number?

And she didn't want anything to do with you then. At this point N A H. \n\nBut the minute she found out your bf was visiting she started haranguing you for info on him.
