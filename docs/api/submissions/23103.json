They left you on purpose because I would guess your step dad doesn't see you as family.\n\nI would stay with the grandparents for a bit.\n\nThis is one of those things that make it so when you're 30 you might not be talking to them anymore.\n\nI hope as you get older you see how fucked this was and how much they are gaslighting you.", "That attitude is probably why OP was left in the first place lol. All teens are such AHs", "That's one explanation for it, but it could easily be the other", "That's not a nice comparison to make... I mean, dildos are actually useful. \ud83d\ude00", "If you don't want to get called a dick, don't act like one.  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 That goes for all ages.", "She said she didn't have space for him..\nThat was the specific reason. Doesn't matter if your child has behavioral issues, you don't lie to them, about why you're not bringing them somewhere. You don't abandon them. You step up and act like a parent, get them help if they need it, or lay down some consequences if need be. You don't just lie to and abandon your child for a week just because you want to go on vacation. That is acting like a dick. And when you act like one, you get called one. You don't get to get mad at the person for calling you out on your s***** behavior.", "Have a conversation with your grandparents or dad and ask if they would be willing to let you live there till 18.\n\nI'm NOT saying you should go down this road.  However, you should be learning what options you have available if this kind of actions become the norm in your home.\n\nIs this type of behavior normal for your mom & step-dad?  If they are treating you this way then I wonder if your mom is receiving child support from your bio dad and redirecting that money towards your siblings instead (like this trip)\n\n===\n\nAlso, the reason your mom is focusing on your language is because she wants to avoid discussing why she and her husband are huge AH for purposely leaving you out.", "Sorry kiddo they did t want you there cause you\u2019re a step son. Your presence affects the small little family your mom has made. See if you can move with your dad and Grammy now.", "Please please don't let your mom be quiet on finances.\n\nThey may try and cut you out, don't let them. Mine did exactly that.", "Yes, and as a parent she should have been acting like one instead of abandoning their minor child, simply because she didn't have space.\n\nShe acted like a dick, she gets called one. Doesn't matter who you are, if you have s***** behavior you deserve to get called out on it. Your parents need to show you The same respect they expect you to show them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "You\u2019re clearly not considering you won\u2019t even acknowledge that anything else happened in the post", "NTA.

NTAH.", "Commenting so i can come back to the update lmfao", "Maybe ask your mum why she thought the first vacation did not go well. What specifically made her go from wanting to include you to wanting to exclude you?", "I am not sure I would return home if that happened to me, knowing what I know now.  That isn\u2019t a loving home.  Not sure what your options are, but if you have any, explore them.  Life is too short and too precious to hang out where people don\u2019t value your company.", "Your parents are dicks - Both of them. I would be mad and sad about this too sand I'm pretty sure most would feel the same. I'd talk to your grandparents about it so they (hopefully) can give your parents an idea why they are dicks when they get back.", "One word of advice.  Know your worth.  No matter where you go from here, be your best self.  Rejection sucks, esp from family.  But there are good things ahead for you.  Trust it, believe it, know it in your heart.", "NTA.\n\nI'll call her that too.", "Im a mum of 4 and i had 3 of them when i met my (now) husband. We had a child together and hes now 4. There is no way i would take some of the kids on holiday and say \"there wasnt room\" for one child.

We have to judge based on the information given.

But, agreed, other options are still open.", "And she could have said there wasn't room and here's some cash to do fun things with grandparents and he'd likely be fine with it.", "You're probably right", "But they already took him. It seems totally fine as long as she was honest about it.", "No. The half brothers were on the first trip as well. It\u2019s completely unacceptable", "But they don't have another dad and grandparents of dad.

Does that make you feel better. Since you know what i am thinking.", "Why do people even make those tiktoks I hate those", "NTA- I think your mother and stepfather absolutely made a bad decision and I think asking your dad to help you have a sit down with your mom to try and talk out everything would be something to consider. With your father only to make sure she\u2019s not going to railroad what you have to say, not so he can chew her out (if that\u2019s something he\u2019s prone to), if he doesn\u2019t work maybe a grandparent.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t think you should be doing is listening to everyone saying you are unloved and have been  abandoned by your mom for \u201cbetter kids\u201d. This messed up thing does not mean she won\u2019t do better in the future- I can see a million ways she could have rationalized leaving you out without thinking the consequences through. Many people consider 14 to old to do the things little kids like your brothers might want to do on a vacation. \n\nYou need to try your best to have an open conversation and tell her exactly how it makes you feel- allow her to explain her side as long as she\u2019s able to be levelheaded and tell her - as kindly as you can possibly manage how and why this hurt you. \n\nMaybe she will be stubborn and selfish , and make terrible decisions and hurt you more. But don\u2019t let other people\u2019s biases and projection keep you from thinking you have no future as part of your own family.", "NTA your parents did you wrong man.

You\u2019re allowed to not bring a 14 year old kid with you on your vacation. What\u2019s the age of the brother? What\u2019s the nature of the vacation? Don\u2019t have enough info", "He's 14.

Your mom was 1000% a huge dick. She lied to you to exclude you on a family vacation. And she lied because she knew what she was doing was wrong.

Now you'll never know if you can believe her when she tells you something.\n\nIt would be one thing if she acknowledges how wrong she was, but clearly she's not going to do that. So trust gone.", "NTA. Let me guess, M5 and M2 belong to stepdad and mom? Sorry kid. \n\nHave a talk with grandparents and dad about this before mom gets back.

Your mother took small children in preference to you on vacation??? Let me guess, the little ones belong to step dad too? \n\nI hate to break it to you, this is a tale as old as time, you are intentionally being excluded from the \u201creal\u201d family.  It\u2019s time to find somewhere else to live.  What\u2019s the story with dad or grandparents? Are any of them an option? The older you get the uglier this is likely to be.

Not only is it incredibly cruel of the stepfather to ask that, but your mother agreed with him and went along with it. \n\nI can't think of any scenario in which they aren't being unimaginably cruel here.

There's nothing wrong with giving each kid some dedicated time, like going and playing catch with one kid, taking another to the movies, taking another shopping, etc, doing something they like and having one on one time.\n\nExcluding a single kid from a family holiday is absolutely NOT okay if you're just honest about it. You're being excluded not from one on one time but family time, it's literally just saying you, we consider you not part of this family so you can't come.", "Don't forget that she also lied!", "NTA.

A few weeks later I got screamed at for over an hour because I told him not to call me 'woman' and use my name because I was \"disrespecting him\" as if it's respectful to call someone woman.
