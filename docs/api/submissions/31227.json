This is such a common outcome for kids who bounced around in foster care. Its a sad reality. Because no one wants to adopt older kid. They want the shiny little newborns. \n\nIm childfree by choice, but if i had wanted kids i would have adopted a child that was past the diapers/toddler stage.

I tried to rehome him and asked all of my friends and the sister\u2019s friends whom I had contact with, but no one was able to help.", "At this point you need to file for a restraining order", "I\u2019m sorry but you need a gun", "And reach out to the parole office to let them know about his behaviors too once the RO goes through", "I don\u2019t know if it would work as he didn\u2019t do anything yet, and I guess cussing out a relative and spitting on the floor doesn\u2019t qualify as a felony.

His parole officer would take this seriously. Contact them, absolutely."]}
