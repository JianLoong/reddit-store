I've been on the receiving end of something similar and it's one hell of an info dump...\n\nIf people aren't into a specific hobby...it's not that interesting to listen to more than once or twice, especially if the person is going into detail. It's not that she doesn't love you...it's that she isn't interested in D and D.  I'd keep it short 'yeah it was high energy today, the best thing was XYZ'. The end.", "INFO:\n\nYou want her to try harder at what? Listening to you in a way which suggests she is interested, or actually being interested in D&D?\n\nDoes she actively listen and engage in conversation with you when you are talking about other things in *your* life (that isn't D&D)? Because the two obvious options are that she isn't that interested in listening to you at all, or she isn't interested in listening about D&D in particular.\n\nAnd when you are telling her abut your weekly D&D interests, how long does this monologue (because really, that is what it is when since she's not actively engaging in the conversation) last?", "YTA. She's just not into D&D dude, and that's fine. You have friends who *are* into it who you can discuss it with. I'm sure there are subs here dedicated to it. I get that you specifically want to share things about your hobby with your girlfriend, but listening to someone drone on about something you don't care about is torture.", "YTA. \n\nI feel you, so I think YTA but softly. You need to understand that you can't force her to like D&D nor to develop a genuine interest - she isn't into it, and more: she isn't playing with you. Maybe the same way you aren't into Kpop or crochet. And here is the thing: you *don't have to* be into everything your partner does. \n\nThe bare minimum isn't asking questions and entertaining your stories, the bare minimum is accepting that your partner likes a thing you don't like, not belittle them or make fun of their hobby, and not discouraging them from engaging in this activity even if it doesn't include you. She does the bare minimum, and some more on top because she knows how important it is for **you** to be able to talk about it, so she will listen when you do.\n\n**I play D&D as well. And honestly, I hate hate hate having to listen to friends going on and on and on about their D&D games. It's like getting someone else's inside joke explained to you, or worse, someone else's situational comedy moments - second hand humour, listening to someone explain a complicated, and often not even really funny joke to me.** It's extremely hard for me to feign interest, DESPITE the fact I'm enjoying D&D myself. It's more fun watching something like critical role, where you can actively watch the game unfolding and are \"part\" of the situation itself. \n\nFind some middle ground and accept your stories aren't all that interesting to anyone who isn't actually part of your game.", "Soft YTA. Just accept that for some people (me included) listening someone talking about d&d (or any other board nerdy stuff) is interesting like a three-day seminar entitled \"The Future of Plumbing\". \nI get it, you want to make conversation, but it is rare that two people share a lot of common hobbies and interests. Just find other stuff you want to talk about. If you can't because your whole personality is about that game, then I'm sorry, but that is extremely sad and I don't understand why she's still with you.\n\nEdit: misspelling", "Very soft YTA. My ex friend was into DND and it can be so confusing and not interesting at all when getting info dumped on. If she doesn't support your other hobbies then that's a problem but maybe she doesn't care for it. Also it's incredibly hard to ask questions about a game like that where you have no idea of the concept. It's like asking qiestions about a really complicated board game, it's difficult to know what to ask or respond with.", "NAH. She's just not interested in D&D. She's listening to your stories to humor you. If you continue to demand active listening from her, you're essentially asking her to fake an interest or lie to you. I'm not blaming you for wanting her to be interested, but you're going to need to find another hobby of yours to talk to her about.", "You\u2019re asking her to pretend to be interested in something she doesn\u2019t care about because you do. That\u2019s a big ask. It\u2019s valid. But it\u2019s also valid that she doesn\u2019t care about it, and you shouldn\u2019t expect her to fake it. \n\nYou should either get past the fact that she doesn\u2019t care, or break up with her for not caring enough. Those are both valid choices. But asking her to pretend to care about something she doesn\u2019t is kindof asking her to be someone different. I think for this reason that your request is kindof an AH request. YTA. Get over it or break up with her.", "YTA\n\nIt's possible that she genuinely doesn't know what questions to ask, but it's also possible that she's just not used to actively engaging in conversations about topics that don't interest her. Bless her for listening to approx 10-minute summary of a game, weekly.", "NAH.\n\nI love DnD. It's extremely fun to play.\n\nBut I find it extremely boring to hear about other people's campaigns (unless they were running a module I've run before). I'm in the minority of DnD fans who think like this, but I just don't give a shit about other people's campaigns. Clearly many people enjoy it, otherwise Critical Role wouldn't be as popular as it is, but personally, hearing about someone else's campaign is like hearing someone explain every joke at the improv theater they went to last night - it's only fun if you were there and could participate. \n\nSo I understand why your GF doesn't care, and also why you want to gush about how fun last session was. I'd just stick to DnD recaps with my DnD friends who aren't in my campaign, and find something else to talk about with the GF that you like and she can listen to.\n\nIf she's this uninterested in _any_ interest of yours that she doesn't share, then I'd start worrying.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t an A H for wanting her to be more interested\u2026geez I wish my wife was interested in ANYTHING i do.  But you are an A H for expecting it and being upset that she\u2019s not\n\nYou cannot expect people to be interested in something they have no interest in.", "NAH.\n\nIm not into D&D, but I have friends who are. I genuinely think its great that they enjoy it.\n\nHowever,\n\nD&D is like your crazy dream that blew your mind last night, or a TV show the other person hasn't seen - the retelling of its is infinitely less enjoyable than the experience. Theres also no aspect of it that another person can give feedback or input into, because its just a retelling & therefore a very one-sided exchange. It's not quality communication.\n\nThat doesn't mean she doesn't care about you and she isn't happy for your enjoyment of it. But you just cant expect her to engage in that part of your life in detail. Which is okay, having seperate interests makes you different and unique people. She doesn't have to share everything.", "NTA I dont think you are asking for much, im not getting the y t a votes. I would be annoyed if my so couldnt listen to me about something im excited about just because they werent excited about it. I want to be able to share my life and the things I find important.", "YTA.   \nShe\u2019s not interested, so stop pushing it, or you will end up pushing her away.", "NAH i think it can be really boring to hear about things like this sometimes and it is difficult to respond. if i were your gf i would have no clue what to ask about or how to react, maybe give her guidance on how to react? maybe she feels shes being as present as you are when shes talking about her hobbies and doesnt realise how big the difference feels to you? shes making an effort, if its not enougj you will have to be more specific with her", "NAH. I don't think it's hard to listen and chime in. I think that she needs to evaluate why you're even together if she can't even listen to something you're interested in. What do you guys have in common? \n\nFrom my own experience: I think listening to my girlfriend drone on and on about her dnd campaign is also boring as fuck sometimes... but I also ask her about things I'm interested in regarding the game. A play by play of the story is just Zzzzzzz.", "YTA for getting upset at her response. You've turned it into a sore spot now. She was already engaging with it at a level she was comfortable with, but it wasn't good enough? Of course she got defensive. Would you rather she fake her interest so you can feel better about droning on? That's exhausting.\n\nPartners can enjoy stuff separately. And I understand the afterglow of a thrilling ttrpg session,    but if your partner isn't into it - stop dropping the entire Tonight's Episode Recap on them every time. You shouldn't be feigning interest either, that's a poor expectation to have.", "YTA. You mentioned elsewhere that your recaps are about ten minutes long. Expecting someone who doesn\u2019t care about a topic to last more than a couple minutes of active listening on *something they don\u2019t care about* regularly is a very large ask. I\u2019m sure if you kept it to a minute and highlights that could plausibly interest someone outside your group she\u2019d be more engaged.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s understandable to be frustrated if she\u2019s not interested, but if she\u2019s not, she\u2019s not. I think your bare minimum is a bit too high, and you shouldn\u2019t have pushed it.", "NTA, I get it D&D is not her thing, but this is not about her this is about taking an interest in your partner\u2019s hobby. He doesn\u2019t like K-pop and crocheting and yet he takes an interest because they\u2019re important to her. That\u2019s how it works \n\nBtw D&D seems so cool to me I\u2019d love to find people who play irl", "NTA. Being in a relationship takes two people. You communicated that you wanted your wife to reciprocate active listening when you are talking about a hobby you love, emphasising to her its importance to you. As a partner, she should\u2019ve taken this into account even if she doesn\u2019t feel the same way and concentrated more effort into the conversation. However it appears to me, she has disregarded your feelings even after clear communication about what you wanted. Having a partner is having someone to talk to about your ups and downs, hobbies and disinterests. So therefore, expecting the same partner to actively listen to you and respond accordingly IS the bare minimum.", "soft YTA. Have you ever included her in D&D before now besides infodumping after a game and then getting upset quietly when she didn\u2019t respond as you wanted? I speak as someone who plays now, I was kept from playing as a kid because middle schoolers didn\u2019t want to play with a girl. (Jokes on them I\u2019m Non-binary suck it Spencer) I only got to play after years of wanted to recently, turns out my great BF is a forever DM (score.) But for a lot of women, D&D was essentially kept from them growing up, either girls interested in it were dissuaded, or more likely in your GF\u2019s case, it was never even on her radar- it just wasn\u2019t a hobby for girls, if she even knew what it was. Crocheting has an obvious visual process, you don\u2019t need to know how to crochet or it\u2019s history to see the difference between a green hat and a striped sweater. Same with Kpop- it\u2019s music, anyone can listen or watch a 3 minute video. But D&D is a little arcane (lol) and super complicated. And I love the stuff! She was trying, but she came across as disinterested because she didn\u2019t know what the hell you were on about- but she was trying. And now she knows you\u2019d like more from her and she\u2019s trying harder-\n\nBut she still doesn\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re on about! My advice is a small apology for being defensive, tell her you love her, and that as silly as it sounds this hobby really is as important as Kpop and crocheting is to her, and show her the PHB and any cool maps or figures you have. Maybe take her to the new movie (it\u2019s VERY good) or maybe season 4 of stranger things. Make sure she knows you\u2019re not trying to make her play, you just realize she doesn\u2019t have the context on what you\u2019re talking about, so you\u2019d like to give her some, and if after that she\u2019s still not really interested, then suck it up that you have a girlfriend who\u2019s really not into D&D. But she IS trying, and might not really have the knowledge to SAY anything more in depth than, \u201cthat\u2019s cool honey\u201d", "Sorry, but YTA dude. Your girlfriend isn\u2019t into D&D. People like what they like and you can\u2019t ask her to care more about something she has no interest in. \n\nIf *sharing your hobbies* is important to you in a partner, break up with her and look for a girlfriend who also likes all the things you like. If *supporting you to enjoy your hobbies* is what\u2019s important to you, you\u2019ve already got that! She doesn\u2019t mind that you spend a lot of time playing D&D with your friends and she\u2019s even okay with you telling her about it despite her disinterest. If she didn\u2019t care at all, she\u2019d be annoyed by how much time you spend at it and she wouldn\u2019t patiently wait for you to finish telling her about your campaign. \n\nAlso, one final thought/question: how much do *you* care about *her* interests? Is she into stuff you don\u2019t care about, and do you ask her how it\u2019s going anyway and listen to her talk about it even if you are bored to tears? If not, you\u2019re also a hypocrite. Don\u2019t ask something of a partner that you\u2019re not willing to give them in return.", "NAH I actually am into D&D and yet it remains incredibly dull being subjected to a retelling of a game I wasn't in. I understand why you're hurt but your expectations in this case aren't so reasonable. Chat with your game mates about events, give your partner a couple of sentences and let it go.", "NTA\n\nTo me, she seems a little cold. It doesn\u2019t take much to ask a few engaging questions, especially if you\u2019ve expressed how much it means to you. \n\nThat being said you should try to understand her side of things too. If she\u2019s just not into Dungeons & Dragons, then it might be difficult for her to think of engaging questions to ask and she may not mean to come off rude.\n\nBut I do agree that what she said feels like a bitter attempt.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t have to be into D&D to be an active listener. Or feel the same excitement/disappointment whatever you\u2019re feeling when talking about something you\u2019re passionate about. That alone is enough to actively listen to your partner. It\u2019s not like your asking her to learn the game.", "Get a different girlfriend.", "NTA \nRelationships are a two way street, how would she feel if you did the same to her when she tried to talk about her hobbies???", "Nta. My partner has several interests that I don't personally find exciting or care about; but I care about him so I try and take an interest when he's talking to me about them. He does the same. She could be making a bit of an effort to make you feel important to her as you do with her hobbies.", "I used to pretend to care about my husband's DnD adventures. But he wouldn't listen when I talked about the things I cared about. So I said I wasn't going to listen to him if he wasn't going to listen to me. So just treat her the same way, when she talks about her hobbies that you don't care about just don't say anything and then say \"Interesting.\" and see how she likes it. She will either decide that she's willing to pretend to care in exchange for you pretending to care, or you will just stop talking about things the other doesn't care about, which will harm the relationship. NTA.", ">And now, two weeks after asking her she now says \"so are you going to tell me about it\", is quiet the whole time, then says \"very interesting, thanks for sharing.\"\n\nNTA. And that part even sounds like she is actively trying to mock you and do the \"I'm doing what you wanted, okay?!\" victim thing here.  \n\n\nYou need to have a serious adult talk with her, if you want to continue this relationship. People do not need to be into the same things, but they should care about their partners interests to the minimum of them having someone to talk to about it.   \nI do not understand much about cars or car cleaning stuff, but it's one of her passions, and she tells me about it, I try to question details so she can explain certain parts. Shows me videos, I make dumb jokes every now and then , we laugh.   \n\n\nIt's really simple to be a decent partner and show interest", "YTA it's super hard to feign extended interest in something you're simply not. It's be completely fair for her to ask you to limit your gushing to 5 minutes. You're playing weekly. I don't know how long your sessions are, but that's quite a lot of dedicated DnD time. Expecting your gf to put in another half hour or so just to hear your recap is a lot. Maybe branch out and find a second hobby. Perhaps something you and your gf can enjoy together.", "Yta. Sometimes, other people's interests are way more than just not your interests.\nIf my mother starts talking to me about cars, it's not that I'm uninterested.

Think about it this way: there is a popular D&D show called Critical Role where you can watch people play D&D for hours, over multiple seasons. When I say popular, I mean some people who watch it may not play D&D themselves. Now this is basically top-tier D&D content, as the host of this show does this for a living and has an entire team working on making this a good experience. \n\nBut someone who isn't into D&D will not find this entertaining, and certainly will not be able to sit through 4-5 hour long episodes.\n\nIRL, you don't have top-tier D&D. Your game master is a person who does this as a hobby, who might or might not be a good story teller themselves, and who is at best mediocre at acting, or art, or world building. The players aren't actors, established writers or entertainers either, but people like you and me who also do this as a hobby. This is at best entertaining as a player or GM, but I bet, not even other D&D players would want to watch it if you made a recording of it, let alone an entire season of it. I mean, I am a GM together with a friend, our campaigns have been ongoing since 4 years, we are having fun and our players are having fun, but there exists no reality where what we are doing is of any entertainment value to anyone who isn't part of it. \n\nNot even if they could watch us play. In the end, it's watching someone do a guided imagination with some people + some dice rolls and rules. If you don't know the rules or what the dice rolls mean, it's literally just watching someone do a guided imagination with a group of people.   \n\n\nNow imagine getting a second hand account of this. It's worse than having to listen to other people's \"guess what I dreamed about last night\" stories. It's worse than listening to someone trying to describe the images in a cartoon you can't see yourself. And all of this is 1000 times worse if you aren't interested in the setting or the mechanics of the game at all.", "Yes, expecting someone to regularly listen to you talk at them for 10 minutes straight about something they have zero interest in is boorish.", ">this one thing isn't a break up thing\n\nSo you've been together since you were 14? Yeah... you're both still really young, and you haven't been in any other relationships. I can tell you that people do a lot of growing up and changing between the ages of 20 and 25. And if you've never had a relationship with anyone else, you don't have any way to gauge whether the one you're in is healthy or strong. That's not a criticism -- some people get together very young and spend a lifetime being happy together.\n\nBut I also saw a whole lot of friends who got together in high school, and grew and changed in their 20s and became no longer right for each other (and frequently that happened *after* marriage and kids, so the breakup was a shitshow). And I cringe now remembering how much I was like you. How hard I tried in relationships where the other person just couldn't be bothered to care about anything except what they liked and what they wanted to do. How many times I showed an interest and did things, simply because it was important to my partner. And how many things I missed out on, because the other person didn't care enough to do things that I wanted to do.\n\nSo I'm not suggesting you should break up. But I do think you need to ask yourself: What if your girlfriend never shows any more interest in your things than what she shows today? If your relationship 5 years from now is still exactly the one you wrote about today, will you be happy? What about 10 years from now? Are you settling for \"close enough\"?\n\nOne of the things I learned when I got older is that it's possible to love someone very much and still not be right for each other. I hope you'll keep that in mind.

That's what friends are for, so we have other people to talk about other stuff, too!\n\nHeck, if I would go and talk to my partner about the intricate details of my everyday job, or tell him exactly what I did at work today - I would bore the living shit out of him.

My favourite is Y because....\" discussion again - but you do it because you love the child.\n\nAs a parent, you have to do that. Because a child needs encouragement and a child also hasn't learned yet how to have adult conversations and hasn't figured out when info-dumping is appreciated and when it's not.

I was later invited to a party at their house on another occasion and politely declined.  I would rather eat dirt then have that ever occur again.   YTA, just tell her 'had a good time it was fun.'  The next time she tells you about the intricate knot she is crocheting, wait til she is finished, and say interesting, thanks for sharing.", "YTA. She does not owe you interest in your hobbies any more than you owe her interest in hers. If her level of involvement isn\u2019t enough for you perhaps find someone that you have more in common with? You asking her about her likes does not automatically win you \u201cinterest points\u201d whereby she then needs to reciprocate.", "YTA- My husband talks to me about apex/fortnight and I tell him every time \"I have no idea what any of that means but I'm glad you're having fun\"", "YTA. she doesn\u2019t care about this! let it go. i\u2019m sure she\u2019s happy that you enjoy it, but ffs leave her alone. D&D is torture for people that don\u2019t enjoy it.", "NAH. I think she is doing more than most by trying to listen even though she probably would rather watch the paint dry on the walls. Some people are great at pretending to be interested and some people are not. I am not one of those people. I can't fake being interested in something that I don't care about but I will listen to you talk about it. I don't think she means it being rude she just doesn't actively care.", "Ok, people are saying that this is a big ask, but they have clearly never talked to a kpop fan. I guarantee that the op is being treated to just as detailed a convo about the members. their vlogs, events, new releases, gossip and the working details of the companies that develop the groups, lol. This is not as uneven as you think.  \n\n\nHonestly, I think you aren't suited to each other. You want someone who takes an interest in your hobbies while she doesn't seem to care about that, or only cares that you are interested in hers--and the sarcastic pretend interest is childish af. There are lots of women out there who are interested in D&D", "YTA\n\nNewsflash, dude - D&D stories are tedious as hell to listen to for non-players.  I'd rather listen to baseball stats than hear yet another campaign story.  And I write those games for a living.\n\nthe fact she asks if you had fun is enough, she doesn't have to fake caring about what actually happens.\n\nWorst part of my job is listening to somebody drone on and on about their campaign and party drama, worse is when they tell me about their plans for a homebrew system that is so fucking awesome you should produce it!\".", "Y T A comments have never been in a relationship.  If she finds your boring and your hobbies boring shy be with you?  NTA.  I say almost every couple have something that the other finds boring, you push through it and show interest because you like them.", "YTA.  She isn't interested in DnD.  A lot of people aren't.  That's ok.  In order for her to really understand your lengthy stories she would need to learn more about it than she's interested to.", "NTA\nI think a lot of the responses here are just a reflection of how different everyone in what\u2019s important to them in a relationship - it\u2019s not wrong, just different. \n\nSo this is a key importance in my relationships. I come from a family of 5, and 4 of us are neurodivergent. We have a diverse range of special interests, and we all put in the effort to show interest and lift each other up. We don\u2019t necessarily have the same interests, but man do we engage in each others\u2019 interests to demonstrate our love for each other and to make others feel interesting. My mum and dad are a perfect example. My dad loves two things - dinosaurs and board games. My mum HATES board games, but will listen and engage in conversations, and very occasionally will even play a game with him - to show interest in him, to show love for him, and to actively share in his joy and make him happy. My mum watches a lot of makeup   Videos, and dad will ask questions and even watch them with her to show that same interest in her, the same love and to make her happy. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have separate interests and engage independently, it just means that sometimes they engage together because it\u2019s important to them. \n\nI\u2019ve brought this to my romantic relationships as an adult. My partner LOVES Star Trek and is even doing her PHD in it. Star Trek is a key part of her identity. I don\u2019t like Star Trek, but you bet I\u2019m going to ask questions and engage in conversations about it - because I love her and I don\u2019t want her to feel that I dismiss parts of her that are important. You can also bet that she will listen to me rant (for definitely more than 10 minutes) about my latest game fixation or work, even though it\u2019s not her interest - because she knows it\u2019s important to me, and it makes me feel valued and interesting to her. Ultimately, we want our partners to feel interested in us. It certainly doesn\u2019t mean that we only engage in those interests together - I prefer to play games alone, or to be alone in general, but it does mean that we will engage with each other to show how much we value each other. \n\nActive listening for me is a basic in all conversations. It\u2019s not me asking her to be interested in the topic, but to be interested and engaged with me, to show her love and care for me and parts of my identity. Active listening is verbal and nonverbal - it\u2019s asking for a head nod to show engagement, some light paraphrasing or clarifying statements, or even a well placed \u201coh!\u201d To show that you\u2019re listening. I\u2019m also human, meaning sometimes I just don\u2019t have the brain power to engage in that way about Star Trek. You know what I do? Talk to my partner about it - \u201chey I love you and my brain is just not keeping up today. I\u2019m super interested in you and what you have to say and I care about you, is it ok if we have this conversation when I can pay proper attention and keep up?\u201d \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AT \u263a\ufe0f", "INFO:\n\nDo you act as interested in her hobbies as you want her to be in yours?  If not, does she insist that you act interested in her stuff?", "Maybe you and she could go to the D&D movie and have a nice dinner? She\u2019s much more likely to be receptive through a mutual experience.", "Not the asshole at all, always good if your ex has an interest in the things you enjoy.\n\nWhere ti go next depends on how big an issue it is, if its a dealbreaker end the relationship. If not move on.", "Because you're actively showing interest in her hobbies, nta. But I suggest starting to show hers only the same level of interest she does yours and watch how fast the relationship dies.", "you can\u00b4t force other people to \"really like\" your oddly specific hobbies.  Trying to force that unto other would make you unssufferable to be around.  YTA", "YTA. \n\nMy mother-in-law would do this to my wife. She would tell a detailed blow-by-blow of every roleplaying session, and my wife (a casual but not frequent roleplayer) would politely listen. In general, such a story isn't all that engaging to an outsider. Roleplaying is an activity where *you had to be there* for most of what happens to really be interesting. Unless you are a novelist or an exceptional storyteller, you may as well be telling people about that one dream you had or the time you went to the DMV and had to take your photo twice. \n\nIf your partner never listened to you at all, I could understand being miffed. But on this specific issue, it comes across as you demanding she force herself to act more interested even when she isn't, rather than respecting that she's politely interested but not in love with D&D like you are.", "I agree completely. But also from my own experience of being the glazed donut gf that didn't listen, it truly is important to teach yourself to be a better listener. My bfs job isn't boring, I just don't understand it. But I actually started listening a little better and have learned a couple things and he really appreciates it. They don't want us to magically think it's interesting or super cool they just want to know that we think they're important enough to put the effort into and truly, I find it extremely hurtful and disrespectful when I notice people not listening to me", "Agreed. Hearing about other people's D&D campaigns is seriously boring because it's not real.", "I work in the industry.  You are entirely right about it.", "I second this. Stop actively listening and participating in conversations about her hobbies.", "Imagine if someone kept rambling on about a boring tv show that you don't watch, don't follow, don't know or care about the characters, etc.\n\nThat's what you're doing, and it's the fast path to being single.", "OP, I'm an old-school D&D player; I started back in the '70s with the original edition in the three tan chapbooks, so 40+ years. I can tell you unequivocally that *nobody* wants to hear about your D&D session, not even other players. I figured that out really quickly and did my best to keep it all to myself. All you need to tell your gf is that your group had a good time, and leave it at that.", "My husband is a role player (D&D and other stuff). I'm a Larper who's not a D&D fan. A lot of our friends are one or both. \n\nI'd agree with the 2 sentences thing but try and stick to the story rather than any character specifics. \n\nWhen I get home from a weekends larp he is very good at listening to me info drop but it's as likely to be news about the others I play with as IC stuff", "Have you ever invited her to a short game?(NOT a campaign and NOT with die-hard Lawfuls who will sneer at her inexperience). Have you helped her roll up a character or two? If you don't overload and bombard her with rules and stats, she might enjoy herself enough to understand why you like it. \n\nNAH", "Yeah my wife likes to know what video games i play, i keep it to a general high level description. 'im a rice farmer and o get to use magic to defeat monsters'\n\nIf its more close to anime tropes i give a bit more detail, but 2 lines is all that's necessary.", "Ok, but, are you really going to want to listen to me excitedly talk about what happened on the latest episode of Survivor in detail, when you may not know the ins and outs of why the producer provided fake immunity idol is bullshit?  Or why it\u2019s fun the Carolyn led Sarah to the birdcage with a red ex only and that Sarah got voted out with her immunity idol only it was fake so really it\u2019s better that she didn\u2019t play it and should have probably played her SITD instead of voting?\n\nMost people are not going to want to hear me info dump on Survivor strategy and what\u2019s going on in current or past seasons.  I think it\u2019s great and interested, but most people would not.  Especially if I have to stop and explain the mechanics of the game\u2026\n\nYou can appreciate my enthusiasm without me going on and on about what happened.\n\nI am curious how long it takes OP to describe his sessions and how detailed he gets.", "She is happy he's happy - she just doesn't want a step by step retelling of stuff that's meaningless to her.", " What was a really funny joke at the time never really works outside of the game, at least to me.", "This. The extent he wants her to act interested in what she couldn't care less about is weird", "Happy birthday to your kiddo! My youngest turns 9 in 2 months and I am very much in that \"where does the time go?\" frame of mind", "Dude I'm totally buying one for my partner, these are awesome! Thanks for sharing, let your SIL know that Reddit strangers think she's super talented \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlso for anyone keeping score of the comments pro- and con- OP staying in this \"incompatible\" relationship.... I -- a non-gamer -- am excitedly and supportively buying this as a gift for my D&D and Warhammer playing spouse. You really can make it work even if you don't share hobbies, promise.", "Thank you! I keep telling her to stop growing but she says \"I can't! I'm a *child*!\" \ud83e\udd23", "You might enjoy Adventure is Nigh from the Escapist. I've never played or had interest in D&D but it was very entertaining and taught me a lot about how the game actually works. \n\nI'm currently eagerly awaiting their upcoming releases of a side quest and new season.", "I don't really think 10 minutes is a super long time for for someone to be talking about their interests to their partner? If your partner is telling you about something they're interested in, and it only takes you 5-10 minutes before you get bored and start tuning then out, that's a you issue.", "OP hasn't said she's bored or tuning him out, just that she isn't actively listening and asking questions about it.", "I mean, he said he felt like he was talking to a wall.\n\nSo maybe she wasn't bored or tuning him out, but she certainly wasn't being an active part of the conversation, the way he is when she's going on about her hobbies."]}
