I've been on the receiving end of something similar and it's one hell of an info dump...\n\nIf people aren't into a specific hobby...it's not that interesting to listen to more than once or twice, especially if the person is going into detail. It's not that she doesn't love you...it's that she isn't interested in D and D.  I'd keep it short 'yeah it was high energy today, the best thing was XYZ'. The end.", "INFO:\n\nYou want her to try harder at what? Listening to you in a way which suggests she is interested, or actually being interested in D&D?\n\nDoes she actively listen and engage in conversation with you when you are talking about other things in *your* life (that isn't D&D)? Because the two obvious options are that she isn't that interested in listening to you at all, or she isn't interested in listening about D&D in particular.\n\nAnd when you are telling her abut your weekly D&D interests, how long does this monologue (because really, that is what it is when since she's not actively engaging in the conversation) last?", "YTA. She's just not into D&D dude, and that's fine. You have friends who *are* into it who you can discuss it with. I'm sure there are subs here dedicated to it. I get that you specifically want to share things about your hobby with your girlfriend, but listening to someone drone on about something you don't care about is torture.", "YTA. \n\nI feel you, so I think YTA but softly. You need to understand that you can't force her to like D&D nor to develop a genuine interest - she isn't into it, and more: she isn't playing with you. Maybe the same way you aren't into Kpop or crochet. And here is the thing: you *don't have to* be into everything your partner does. \n\nThe bare minimum isn't asking questions and entertaining your stories, the bare minimum is accepting that your partner likes a thing you don't like, not belittle them or make fun of their hobby, and not discouraging them from engaging in this activity even if it doesn't include you. She does the bare minimum, and some more on top because she knows how important it is for **you** to be able to talk about it, so she will listen when you do.\n\n**I play D&D as well. And honestly, I hate hate hate having to listen to friends going on and on and on about their D&D games. It's like getting someone else's inside joke explained to you, or worse, someone else's situational comedy moments - second hand humour, listening to someone explain a complicated, and often not even really funny joke to me.** It's extremely hard for me to feign interest, DESPITE the fact I'm enjoying D&D myself. It's more fun watching something like critical role, where you can actively watch the game unfolding and are \"part\" of the situation itself. \n\nFind some middle ground and accept your stories aren't all that interesting to anyone who isn't actually part of your game.", "Soft YTA. Just accept that for some people (me included) listening someone talking about d&d (or any other board nerdy stuff) is interesting like a three-day seminar entitled \"The Future of Plumbing\". \nI get it, you want to make conversation, but it is rare that two people share a lot of common hobbies and interests. Just find other stuff you want to talk about. If you can't because your whole personality is about that game, then I'm sorry, but that is extremely sad and I don't understand why she's still with you.\n\nEdit: misspelling", "Very soft YTA. My ex friend was into DND and it can be so confusing and not interesting at all when getting info dumped on. If she doesn't support your other hobbies then that's a problem but maybe she doesn't care for it. Also it's incredibly hard to ask questions about a game like that where you have no idea of the concept. It's like asking qiestions about a really complicated board game, it's difficult to know what to ask or respond with.", "NAH. She's just not interested in D&D. She's listening to your stories to humor you. If you continue to demand active listening from her, you're essentially asking her to fake an interest or lie to you. I'm not blaming you for wanting her to be interested, but you're going to need to find another hobby of yours to talk to her about.", "You\u2019re asking her to pretend to be interested in something she doesn\u2019t care about because you do. That\u2019s a big ask. It\u2019s valid. But it\u2019s also valid that she doesn\u2019t care about it, and you shouldn\u2019t expect her to fake it. \n\nYou should either get past the fact that she doesn\u2019t care, or break up with her for not caring enough. Those are both valid choices. But asking her to pretend to care about something she doesn\u2019t is kindof asking her to be someone different. I think for this reason that your request is kindof an AH request. YTA. Get over it or break up with her.", "YTA\n\nIt's possible that she genuinely doesn't know what questions to ask, but it's also possible that she's just not used to actively engaging in conversations about topics that don't interest her. Bless her for listening to approx 10-minute summary of a game, weekly.", "NAH.\n\nI love DnD. It's extremely fun to play.\n\nBut I find it extremely boring to hear about other people's campaigns (unless they were running a module I've run before). I'm in the minority of DnD fans who think like this, but I just don't give a shit about other people's campaigns. Clearly many people enjoy it, otherwise Critical Role wouldn't be as popular as it is, but personally, hearing about someone else's campaign is like hearing someone explain every joke at the improv theater they went to last night - it's only fun if you were there and could participate. \n\nSo I understand why your GF doesn't care, and also why you want to gush about how fun last session was. I'd just stick to DnD recaps with my DnD friends who aren't in my campaign, and find something else to talk about with the GF that you like and she can listen to.\n\nIf she's this uninterested in _any_ interest of yours that she doesn't share, then I'd start worrying.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t an A H for wanting her to be more interested\u2026geez I wish my wife was interested in ANYTHING i do.  But you are an A H for expecting it and being upset that she\u2019s not\n\nYou cannot expect people to be interested in something they have no interest in.", "NAH.\n\nIm not into D&D, but I have friends who are. I genuinely think its great that they enjoy it.\n\nHowever,\n\nD&D is like your crazy dream that blew your mind last night, or a TV show the other person hasn't seen - the retelling of its is infinitely less enjoyable than the experience. Theres also no aspect of it that another person can give feedback or input into, because its just a retelling & therefore a very one-sided exchange. It's not quality communication.\n\nThat doesn't mean she doesn't care about you and she isn't happy for your enjoyment of it. But you just cant expect her to engage in that part of your life in detail. Which is okay, having seperate interests makes you different and unique people. She doesn't have to share everything.", "NTA I dont think you are asking for much, im not getting the y t a votes. I would be annoyed if my so couldnt listen to me about something im excited about just because they werent excited about it. I want to be able to share my life and the things I find important.", "YTA.   \nShe\u2019s not interested, so stop pushing it, or you will end up pushing her away.", "NAH i think it can be really boring to hear about things like this sometimes and it is difficult to respond. if i were your gf i would have no clue what to ask about or how to react, maybe give her guidance on how to react? maybe she feels shes being as present as you are when shes talking about her hobbies and doesnt realise how big the difference feels to you? shes making an effort, if its not enougj you will have to be more specific with her", "NAH. I don't think it's hard to listen and chime in. I think that she needs to evaluate why you're even together if she can't even listen to something you're interested in. What do you guys have in common? \n\nFrom my own experience: I think listening to my girlfriend drone on and on about her dnd campaign is also boring as fuck sometimes... but I also ask her about things I'm interested in regarding the game. A play by play of the story is just Zzzzzzz.", "YTA for getting upset at her response. You've turned it into a sore spot now. She was already engaging with it at a level she was comfortable with, but it wasn't good enough? Of course she got defensive. Would you rather she fake her interest so you can feel better about droning on? That's exhausting.\n\nPartners can enjoy stuff separately. And I understand the afterglow of a thrilling ttrpg session,    but if your partner isn't into it - stop dropping the entire Tonight's Episode Recap on them every time. You shouldn't be feigning interest either, that's a poor expectation to have.", "YTA. You mentioned elsewhere that your recaps are about ten minutes long. Expecting someone who doesn\u2019t care about a topic to last more than a couple minutes of active listening on *something they don\u2019t care about* regularly is a very large ask. I\u2019m sure if you kept it to a minute and highlights that could plausibly interest someone outside your group she\u2019d be more engaged.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s understandable to be frustrated if she\u2019s not interested, but if she\u2019s not, she\u2019s not. I think your bare minimum is a bit too high, and you shouldn\u2019t have pushed it.", "NTA, I get it D&D is not her thing, but this is not about her this is about taking an interest in your partner\u2019s hobby. He doesn\u2019t like K-pop and crocheting and yet he takes an interest because they\u2019re important to her. That\u2019s how it works \n\nBtw D&D seems so cool to me I\u2019d love to find people who play irl", "NTA. Being in a relationship takes two people. You communicated that you wanted your wife to reciprocate active listening when you are talking about a hobby you love, emphasising to her its importance to you. As a partner, she should\u2019ve taken this into account even if she doesn\u2019t feel the same way and concentrated more effort into the conversation. However it appears to me, she has disregarded your feelings even after clear communication about what you wanted. Having a partner is having someone to talk to about your ups and downs, hobbies and disinterests. So therefore, expecting the same partner to actively listen to you and respond accordingly IS the bare minimum.", "soft YTA. Have you ever included her in D&D before now besides infodumping after a game and then getting upset quietly when she didn\u2019t respond as you wanted? I speak as someone who plays now, I was kept from playing as a kid because middle schoolers didn\u2019t want to play with a girl. (Jokes on them I\u2019m Non-binary suck it Spencer) I only got to play after years of wanted to recently, turns out my great BF is a forever DM (score.) But for a lot of women, D&D was essentially kept from them growing up, either girls interested in it were dissuaded, or more likely in your GF\u2019s case, it was never even on her radar- it just wasn\u2019t a hobby for girls, if she even knew what it was. Crocheting has an obvious visual process, you don\u2019t need to know how to crochet or it\u2019s history to see the difference between a green hat and a striped sweater. Same with Kpop- it\u2019s music, anyone can listen or watch a 3 minute video. But D&D is a little arcane (lol) and super complicated. And I love the stuff! She was trying, but she came across as disinterested because she didn\u2019t know what the hell you were on about- but she was trying. And now she knows you\u2019d like more from her and she\u2019s trying harder-\n\nBut she still doesn\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re on about! My advice is a small apology for being defensive, tell her you love her, and that as silly as it sounds this hobby really is as important as Kpop and crocheting is to her, and show her the PHB and any cool maps or figures you have. Maybe take her to the new movie (it\u2019s VERY good) or maybe season 4 of stranger things. Make sure she knows you\u2019re not trying to make her play, you just realize she doesn\u2019t have the context on what you\u2019re talking about, so you\u2019d like to give her some, and if after that she\u2019s still not really interested, then suck it up that you have a girlfriend who\u2019s really not into D&D. But she IS trying, and might not really have the knowledge to SAY anything more in depth than, \u201cthat\u2019s cool honey\u201d", "Sorry, but YTA dude. Your girlfriend isn\u2019t into D&D. People like what they like and you can\u2019t ask her to care more about something she has no interest in. \n\nIf *sharing your hobbies* is important to you in a partner, break up with her and look for a girlfriend who also likes all the things you like. If *supporting you to enjoy your hobbies* is what\u2019s important to you, you\u2019ve already got that! She doesn\u2019t mind that you spend a lot of time playing D&D with your friends and she\u2019s even okay with you telling her about it despite her disinterest. If she didn\u2019t care at all, she\u2019d be annoyed by how much time you spend at it and she wouldn\u2019t patiently wait for you to finish telling her about your campaign. \n\nAlso, one final thought/question: how much do *you* care about *her* interests? Is she into stuff you don\u2019t care about, and do you ask her how it\u2019s going anyway and listen to her talk about it even if you are bored to tears? If not, you\u2019re also a hypocrite. Don\u2019t ask something of a partner that you\u2019re not willing to give them in return.", "NAH I actually am into D&D and yet it remains incredibly dull being subjected to a retelling of a game I wasn't in. I understand why you're hurt but your expectations in this case aren't so reasonable. Chat with your game mates about events, give your partner a couple of sentences and let it go.", "NTA\n\nTo me, she seems a little cold. It doesn\u2019t take much to ask a few engaging questions, especially if you\u2019ve expressed how much it means to you. \n\nThat being said you should try to understand her side of things too. If she\u2019s just not into Dungeons & Dragons, then it might be difficult for her to think of engaging questions to ask and she may not mean to come off rude.\n\nBut I do agree that what she said feels like a bitter attempt.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t have to be into D&D to be an active listener. Or feel the same excitement/disappointment whatever you\u2019re feeling when talking about something you\u2019re passionate about. That alone is enough to actively listen to your partner. It\u2019s not like your asking her to learn the game.", "Get a different girlfriend.", "NTA \nRelationships are a two way street, how would she feel if you did the same to her when she tried to talk about her hobbies???", "Nta. My partner has several interests that I don't personally find exciting or care about; but I care about him so I try and take an interest when he's talking to me about them. He does the same. She could be making a bit of an effort to make you feel important to her as you do with her hobbies.", "I used to pretend to care about my husband's DnD adventures. But he wouldn't listen when I talked about the things I cared about. So I said I wasn't going to listen to him if he wasn't going to listen to me. So just treat her the same way, when she talks about her hobbies that you don't care about just don't say anything and then say \"Interesting.\" and see how she likes it. She will either decide that she's willing to pretend to care in exchange for you pretending to care, or you will just stop talking about things the other doesn't care about, which will harm the relationship. NTA.", ">And now, two weeks after asking her she now says \"so are you going to tell me about it\", is quiet the whole time, then says \"very interesting, thanks for sharing.\"\n\nNTA. And that part even sounds like she is actively trying to mock you and do the \"I'm doing what you wanted, okay?!\" victim thing here.  \n\n\nYou need to have a serious adult talk with her, if you want to continue this relationship. People do not need to be into the same things, but they should care about their partners interests to the minimum of them having someone to talk to about it.   \nI do not understand much about cars or car cleaning stuff, but it's one of her passions, and she tells me about it, I try to question details so she can explain certain parts. Shows me videos, I make dumb jokes every now and then , we laugh.   \n\n\nIt's really simple to be a decent partner and show interest", "YTA it's super hard to feign extended interest in something you're simply not. It's be completely fair for her to ask you to limit your gushing to 5 minutes. You're playing weekly. I don't know how long your sessions are, but that's quite a lot of dedicated DnD time. Expecting your gf to put in another half hour or so just to hear your recap is a lot. Maybe branch out and find a second hobby. Perhaps something you and your gf can enjoy together.", "Yta. Sometimes, other people's interests are way more than just not your interests.\nIf my mother starts talking to me about cars, it's not that I'm uninterested.

Think about it this way: there is a popular D&D show called Critical Role where you can watch people play D&D for hours, over multiple seasons. When I say popular, I mean some people who watch it may not play D&D themselves. Now this is basically top-tier D&D content, as the host of this show does this for a living and has an entire team working on making this a good experience. \n\nBut someone who isn't into D&D will not find this entertaining, and certainly will not be able to sit through 4-5 hour long episodes.\n\nIRL, you don't have top-tier D&D. Your game master is a person who does this as a hobby, who might or might not be a good story teller themselves, and who is at best mediocre at acting, or art, or world building. The players aren't actors, established writers or entertainers either, but people like you and me who also do this as a hobby. This is at best entertaining as a player or GM, but I bet, not even other D&D players would want to watch it if you made a recording of it, let alone an entire season of it. I mean, I am a GM together with a friend, our campaigns have been ongoing since 4 years, we are having fun and our players are having fun, but there exists no reality where what we are doing is of any entertainment value to anyone who isn't part of it. \n\nNot even if they could watch us play. In the end, it's watching someone do a guided imagination with some people + some dice rolls and rules. If you don't know the rules or what the dice rolls mean, it's literally just watching someone do a guided imagination with a group of people.   \n\n\nNow imagine getting a second hand account of this. It's worse than having to listen to other people's \"guess what I dreamed about last night\" stories. It's worse than listening to someone trying to describe the images in a cartoon you can't see yourself. And all of this is 1000 times worse if you aren't interested in the setting or the mechanics of the game at all.", "Yes, expecting someone to regularly listen to you talk at them for 10 minutes straight about something they have zero interest in is boorish.", ">this one thing isn't a break up thing\n\nSo you've been together since you were 14? Yeah... you're both still really young, and you haven't been in any other relationships. I can tell you that people do a lot of growing up and changing between the ages of 20 and 25. And if you've never had a relationship with anyone else, you don't have any way to gauge whether the one you're in is healthy or strong. That's not a criticism -- some people get together very young and spend a lifetime being happy together.\n\nBut I also saw a whole lot of friends who got together in high school, and grew and changed in their 20s and became no longer right for each other (and frequently that happened *after* marriage and kids, so the breakup was a shitshow). And I cringe now remembering how much I was like you. How hard I tried in relationships where the other person just couldn't be bothered to care about anything except what they liked and what they wanted to do. How many times I showed an interest and did things, simply because it was important to my partner. And how many things I missed out on, because the other person didn't care enough to do things that I wanted to do.\n\nSo I'm not suggesting you should break up. But I do think you need to ask yourself: What if your girlfriend never shows any more interest in your things than what she shows today? If your relationship 5 years from now is still exactly the one you wrote about today, will you be happy? What about 10 years from now? Are you settling for \"close enough\"?\n\nOne of the things I learned when I got older is that it's possible to love someone very much and still not be right for each other. I hope you'll keep that in mind.

That's what friends are for, so we have other people to talk about other stuff, too!\n\nHeck, if I would go and talk to my partner about the intricate details of my everyday job, or tell him exactly what I did at work today - I would bore the living shit out of him.

Find something else to talk about, find a common interest.\n\nEdited to add: light YTA but only for not using the social cues to figure out she doesn\u2019t wanna hear it and changing the subject to something else", "NAH \n\nSomething it took me a long time to learn is that it\u2019s truly no biggie when you and your partner aren\u2019t on the same page regarding hobbies.\n\nI have not a clue about D&D, so this may sound completely whack, but maybe give her a super brief response to her \u201chow was it?\u201d and give her pointers on things to ask as a follow up, like the storyline of the campaign, your specific objective/role. However, you know she has zero interest so try not to infodump. \n\nI wonder if you could relate it to her KPOP interests - Tell her about the DM being like the groups leader, how different factions are like the dance line, vocal line, visual line etc. Maybe that might help her get it a little better? \n\nIf she\u2019s a STAY, she might be able to assign your characters into different RACHA\u2019s to better understand the dynamic.", "I actually want to learn how to play D&D. \n\nBut I would die of boredom if someone explained their story every week.", "In my case, it was my ex's obsession  with golf; he would explain how he played each hole on the course, the conditions of the course, other golfers, etc. NTA.", "Then she should also stop sharing about her hobbies, but it doesn't seem that big of a deal then to talk to him about things that only interest her.\n\nIf he can listen, ask questions, remember things about her hobbies, so should she.", "Ikr; a hobby isn\u2019t suppose to be enjoyed by everybody!!! For example, I enjoy collecting toy plushies & it makes me happy; but I know that it doesn\u2019t make others happy. Everyone finds happiness somewhere; just not in the same exact thing.", ">It's like getting someone else's inside joke explained to you, or worse, someone else's situational comedy moments - second hand humour, listening to someone explain a complicated, and often not even really funny joke to me.\n\nThis, I don't play D&D but I play video games, and I'm very used to my wife glazing over if I give her more than two sentences about what I'm doing at that moment.", "This is the answer! I also love DnD and reliving some of the sillier bits with the people I play with is one of life's great pleasures but there is so so much context it just doesn't work for other people.\n\nYou're not wrong that it would be good if she made some effort to engage with things you're interested in in general, though. Does she know how?", "God this so much. My friend is a new DM and still shaking out some anxiety she has about being a good dm and I sit there and listen to her about her campaign and her group and I politely comment here and there (we talk over discord so my eye rolling isn\u2019t visible lmao) but it\u2019s so fucking boring and I literally do not care about other peoples games and the weird shit they get up to and their inside jokes that have to be explained and that itself has like a 3 page backstory. But I also don\u2019t want to crush the spirit of a fledging DM lmao.", "As a knitter/crocheter, I would be very surprised if she\u2019s giving him weekly ten-minute monologues about her current crochet project. There\u2019s just only so much to say about it.", "It's one of those games where you have to be there and take part to enjoy it...\n\nI love playing but my ears would bleed if someone sat with me and told me about a game I missed... We go full nerd we dress up and make themed foods... It's a lot of fun", "As a DnD wife I would mabey suggest that you two are not compatible, we scaled our games down to once a month and it still takes a lot of time from my husband and myself...\n\nYou aren't interested in her hobbies and she isn't interested in yours, what do you do together besides movies and adult spicy time...\n\nIf you two were trapped at home unable to go out, or order take out and there is no power if phone signal what would you do?\n\nIm South African and because of loadsedding this is something that happens a lot, our go to is talking about the goblin crusades and what we would do in the case that a goblin uprising would happen right now, but the goblins have a very valid reason for the uprising and we are kinda on thier side but thay are still goblins so it's very complicated...\n\nAre you willing to listen to a monologue about a popular kpop star that decided to cut his hair and why this is such a big problem... The hair cut has political meaning and it might cause the group to break up entirely but this is a problem because they have a 5 year contract with a certain make up brand and if they canceled the contract world war 3 would start... The world would have to deal with the great mac and loreal war... Are you ready to choose sides in this war? Are you willing to defend you home with a make up brush and setting spray?\n\nIf not it might be better to find someone just are weird and excited about dnd as you are, at the end of the day it's going to cause serious problems in your relationship... And it's a really stupid thing to constantly fight about...", "I agree. I\u2019ve been in a relationship for almost a decade and there\u2019s definitely interests me and my partner do not share. I nerd out a lot about things I know my partner wouldn\u2019t care about otherwise - but he wants to learn about it because it\u2019s something I care about and it makes me happy. I do the same with all his interests. It\u2019s really not that much to ask for", "How often do you think she tells OP a story about her latest knitting session?", "If he's been convincingly faking all this time that he's interested in her hobbies, how is she supposed to know that he is, in fact, faking it? If he's not interested, he should just say so.", "Honestly I think that you could tell it in a way that she would be more receptive to like other people were saying. But you\u2019re telling her right now, I\u2019m guessing, without any filter or tailoring it to her. Use some of those other examples and see what gets genuine interested reactions out of her", "Last reply from me, promise, I'm just procrastinating hard at work today :D\n\nI grasp your point, I really do. In a relationship, you want to feel appreciated and you want to feel like your partner finds you interesting. You want her to ask questions about D&D, because then your eyes light up and you can rave on about something you really care about. And she should want that, too. \n\nYou are 30% right. Yes, it's very nice and polite to do that. To be not interested in a topic, but knowing how much your partner enjoys it, you entertain their enthusiasm. It's like when you are a parent and feign interest in your children's stories or particular focus of interests, if it's dinosaurs or cars or princesses - you might internally vomit at the thought of having to sit through yet another \"what's your favourite X? My favourite is Y because....\" discussion again - but you do it because you love the child.\n\nAs a parent, you have to do that. Because a child needs encouragement and a child also hasn't learned yet how to have adult conversations and hasn't figured out when info-dumping is appreciated and when it's not. You teach them that along the way.\n\nYou are not a child tho. Neither is your girlfriend. She is happy to talk about her interests because *she might genuinely think that you find it interesting*. Yeah, maybe she would be disappointed upon figuring out that this actually isn't the case and you just pretended all along. That's a hole you dug for yourself, tho. \n\nIt's as if you hold it over her head that you actively listen to her all the time. As if you are doing her some sort of big favour, when you in fact are pretending, if not lying about it. \n\nWhat is worse, and what is really what makes you the AH here is though that you know that she doesn't like to hear about your D&D stories, and you want to make her pretend anyways so that you can feel good about raving on about it. You want her to engage in a conversation so \"it doesn't feel like I'm talking to myself\". \n\nDon't forget it's D&D either, and not an easy subject. It has a lot of lingo and rules she doesn't know about, too. If I would right now go to my partner and tell him about how I'm excited that I *made a vertical raincloud plot, grouped, writing my own half-eye function in the process, and struggling a lot with having the boxplot outliers only plotted in the boxplot and not in the jittered scatterplot because that would be redundant and hard to see* \\- He would look at me wide eyed not a clue how to react, then say something like \"oh wow, that's cool\" and move on. Because he literally has no idea what I'm talking about, why it is exciting, or why this even was important to me today. He wouldn't even know what questions to ask. I would be an asshole to expect that, and even more so to do this every week.", "You can always count on people telling OP to end their relationship in this sub", "I'm currently single but I'm WAY too invested in RPGs to imagine sharing my life with someone who is actively uninterested in the whole thing.\n\nOP is really young so I really hope he thinks about compatibility more. He literally says \"It's one of my favorite hobbies and I put a lot into it.\" and you know he's going to become one of those DnDads running campaigns for the friends of his kids and whatnot. Imagine having a spouse who expresses disdain for something which has the potential to be a fundamental part of your life...\n\nEdit: dang they've been together six years??", "I doubt their respective interests in D&D and K-POP are the sum total of their relationship.  She may be a loving girlfriend who does all sorts of kindnesses for OP, and her one \u201cflaw\u201d is that she finds listening to D&D recaps to be like watching paint dry.", "Lol you can alw6count on someone pointing out the obvious in this sub too regardless of the facts...\n\nHave you never been in a relationship with someone who just doesn't suit you, and you don't realise it till much much later... Have you always just had perfect relationships?\n\nI have never once met someone who has not at a point in thier life wasted time on someone completely incompatible with themselves... And besides I only ha e the base info my judgement is based on what is shared and I think my question was pretty valid, what do you do whan you are locked in a house with no power or access to the outside world... If your answer is play on our phones or have sex then you don't have a compatible relationship", "I\u2019m only gonna say this once OP, but your girl is clearly not into D&D!!! She\u2019s only pretending to like it because you in a way are forcing her to like it. You can keep denying this; but forcing is still forcing not matter how you try to phrase it.", "I love dnd we play a lot and I can't stand critical roll it's painful to watch but the animated version, the legend of vox machina has been watched about 30 times already... Mabey op and the girlfriend isn't compatible...\n\nDnd takes a lot out of a relationship and she may eventually become resentful of the time he spends playing or the hours of prep he does... It's best to find yourself a fellow nerd as a partner... I say this out of experience.", "May I suggest Dimension 20 as an alternate?"]}
