My wife \"Jen\" and I have been together for over 20 years, and have 3 school-aged kids. While Jen has a number of great qualities and we have a good marriage, there's one thing she does in particular that bugs the hell out of me. She will take/borrow anything from me, and inevitably lose it or use it all up. Nail clippers, tweezers, scissors, deodorant, toothpaste, socks, shampoo, underwear, combs, etc. \n\nIf she wants or needs to use something, she will just do it without asking. It wasn't a big deal at first, as many of those types of things are meant to be shared in my mind. The problem is that she will not put it back when she's done, and then forgets where she did put it so it's lost unless one of us stumbles across it randomly in the future. \n\nA couple common examples. She'll take my deodorant out of my drawer and use it, then put it somewhere random so when I try to use it it's nowhere to be found. At any given time there's probably a dozen partially used sticks of deodorant somewhere in our house or her car because of this. I also use a special shampoo for dry scalp, which if I use alone lasts for about 6 months. When Jen runs out of her shampoo, she will use mine and the entire thing is gone is a few days. At the beginning it was a little quirky and annoying, but over time it became incredibly frustrating and I've even blown up a couple times (relatively speaking, neither of us are yellers).\n\nSo here's where I might by tah. I have been hiding personal sets of these types of items from her, and absolutely refusing to tell here where they are even when she asks. To be clear, Jen has her own of everything, she just loses them eventually. She also knows that I have a secret stash, and if she happens across anything hidden she will still use it like normal. The change is that when I initially started doing this she would ask when she needed something and and lost hers, and I would give in and give her whatever she was looking for. When that didn't work I took a hardline, no exceptions approach. This sometimes leads to arguments, but I no longer cave. \n\nI know this is a little frivolous and petty, but AITA here?", "created_utc": 1678320805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mczre/aita_for_hiding_things_from_my_wife/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not frivolous or petty either. She has repeatedly, without regard, gone against a specific and reasonable request from you. It's completely unacceptable behavior, especially for hygiene reasons and using your prescription. I'm surprised you don't have a locked box for your stuff at this point.", "Nta this is incredibly infuriating and your wife is being very inconsiderate", "NTA!  These little things are one of the infuriating parts of marriage. It\u2019s obviously not going to ruin the relationship but I hate how inconsiderate my wife can be with my stuff. \n\nI have a jacket that I owned for like ten years. She put it on to take out the trash once and broke the zipper and tore a hole in it trying to unstick it. \n\nI bought us both these electric travel mugs - she never remembers to charge hers so she takes mine and then\u2026doesn\u2019t charge it. \n\nIn these cases it\u2019s perfectly fine to have your stuff and she has her stuff!", "Nta.  That would be super frustrating.", "NTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t even petty, it\u2019s completely understandable.\n\nI would loose my mind if I lived with someone like that!", "NTA- just managing the relationship. Finding the ebb and flow of a 20 year marriage takes commitment, devotion and a bit of insanity", "NTA. I have ADHD and do this a lot. My husband and I both build middle kits that require clippers to cut them away from the runners. I went through 6 pair of these in less than a month bc I would use them and then set them down somewhere and that\u2019s the end of that. My husband made the rule that his clippers are off limits unless I use them under his supervision and literally every time I set them down hand them back to him. This is annoying and a big issue since he often doesn\u2019t want to deal with it so I end up not being able to build my kits unless I go buy yet another set of clippers. \n\nI also understand completely why he does it and it has helped me keep up with mine some. The last pair I bought lasted a whole 3 months before I lost them. \n\nRegardless of the reason she does it, it\u2019s a problem for you and you aren\u2019t wrong for putting up boundaries so you don\u2019t have to suffer from her lack of being able to keep up with things. I do think there might be some things you could do to help her get better though that you might want to try doing.", "NTA, it is probably saving your sanity, lol.\n\nYou would think by now she would be more careful, but she will have to figure it out.  Keep hiding your stuff.", "NTA. \n\nAn idea might be to buy travel sized products in bulk so even if she loses it, there is a further stash and products aren't sitting around half used expiring all over the house.", "NTA. You\u2019ve brought this up to her multiple times and it continued to be a problem. You\u2019ve resorted to the one thing that seems to work, so I don\u2019t blame you for that. But you really need to sit down with her and discuss things a bit more in depth. \n\nAlso speaking as someone who\u2019s researching neurological disorders, it might also be helpful to receive medical advice. While being forgetful about item placement doesn\u2019t seem like a huge issue, if this is a consistent problem, it could be the result of a memory-related deficit. The way the brain converts events into memories is pretty complex and is kinda different depending on if it\u2019s short-term, long-term, active, passive, and other things. This could be nothing to be concerned about, but I\u2019d recommend getting a referral to a neurologist.", "NTA\n\nUsing someone else's deodorant is disgusting btw.", "NTA. Has she been checked for ADHD?", "It wouldn't be so bad if she was just using your stuff. But then immediately lose it? How big is your place or how many closets and drawers do you have where nothing she loses can be found...and your stash can't be found either?\n\nBut NTA.", "NTA But I have to say it\u2019s weird that your wife would want to use your deodorant and wear your underwear. But to each their own. I\u2019m surprised it took you this long to do this. I\u2019d have done the same much earlier.", "NTA. I'm still convinced that a Jack & Jill style bathroom has saved my partner and I a ton of argument. He's lousy at putting things back where they were, but luckily he doesn't use things out of my drawers and spaces without asking. \n\nIf Jen really can't seem to control this, hiding or locking things up doesn't seem unreasonable or petty. But this does seem a bit out of the norm assuming she's generally a considerate person. Obviously reddit shouldn't be diagnosing your wife from this limited bit of information, but this kind of behavior is consistent with several conditions. \n\nWhat is her reasoning for using your things without asking? Do you have separate drawers/closet space, etc?", "NAH\n\nSo Jen sounds neurodivergent (my guess is something attention deficit, but she's needs to look into this for herself). A therapist can help her find coping mechanisms for this kind of executive dysfunction.", "For all the people suggesting Jen suffers from some sort of condition, would you genuinely be asking this if the genders were reversed? Or would you be rightfully declaring them a petty, selfish AH? \n\nSometimes women can simply be AH\u2019s. Bad behaviour doesn\u2019t need to be explained away by imaginary MH conditions.\n\n\nOP, you are definitely NTA. And your concerns are not petty.

It can be very stressful and time consuming to have to deal with this. It's a lot of extra thought to go into making sure you have the things you need, then making sure your spouse has all the things they need as well because they don't keep up with it. It's frustrating being disciplined enough to keep up with your stuff only for it to suddenly go missing or be out of place and require a manhunt to locate.   I got no advice.

We are NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut she seriously needs to get screened for ADHD...it presents very differently in women than the old stereotype hyper boy and this type of thing is a pretty common symptom.

Literally same thing happened when we received matching electric travel mugs for Christmas a few years ago.", "She\u2019s a grown woman why does she need a diagnosis?

Without getting into specifics I'll just say that it would be very unlikely a diagnosis like this would be undiscovered in 40+ years of her life.", "Why does a diagnosis need to be applied to everyone in every situation ever?

She might be able to get medication to fix it.  Do you think only children can get diagnosed with ADHD?", "I was diagnosed as nuerodivergent at 48.

You really shouldn't make assumptions about folks, even if that assumption comes from your experiences.", "Actually, for women MOST of us don't get diagnosed until our 40s, 50s, or older. We present very differently than boys and the research was decades behind. I was diagnosed at 48 for example, and only after making sure to go to a provider who specializes instead of a old white male operating on stereotypes from the 80s.", "As a grown woman with ADHD and executive dysfunction, it was my first thought as well, as she sounds just like me. I have to work hard to remember to put things back where they belong out of respect for my family members.

More an observation than upset. Frustration maybe.", "Do you think everyone needs to be diagnosed with something? Maybe people can fix small issues without being codependent on medication.

I fully believe in therapy, but no not everyone needs it and Redditors like yourself need to get a grip.", "See, my experience has been that whenever anyone, regardless of gender, is mentioned with any kind of recognizable symptoms (for OCD, ADHD, Autism, etc), ppl will ask if that may be the reason behind the behavior. I can't say I've noticed it more with women than men.

That's so surprising! \n\nLmao", "being diagnosed with ADHD can be super helpful not just because of medication but because of different methods to help with the symptoms.
