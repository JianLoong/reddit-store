My wife \"Jen\" and I have been together for over 20 years, and have 3 school-aged kids. While Jen has a number of great qualities and we have a good marriage, there's one thing she does in particular that bugs the hell out of me. She will take/borrow anything from me, and inevitably lose it or use it all up. Nail clippers, tweezers, scissors, deodorant, toothpaste, socks, shampoo, underwear, combs, etc. \n\nIf she wants or needs to use something, she will just do it without asking. It wasn't a big deal at first, as many of those types of things are meant to be shared in my mind. The problem is that she will not put it back when she's done, and then forgets where she did put it so it's lost unless one of us stumbles across it randomly in the future. \n\nA couple common examples. She'll take my deodorant out of my drawer and use it, then put it somewhere random so when I try to use it it's nowhere to be found. At any given time there's probably a dozen partially used sticks of deodorant somewhere in our house or her car because of this. I also use a special shampoo for dry scalp, which if I use alone lasts for about 6 months. When Jen runs out of her shampoo, she will use mine and the entire thing is gone is a few days. At the beginning it was a little quirky and annoying, but over time it became incredibly frustrating and I've even blown up a couple times (relatively speaking, neither of us are yellers).\n\nSo here's where I might by tah. I have been hiding personal sets of these types of items from her, and absolutely refusing to tell here where they are even when she asks. To be clear, Jen has her own of everything, she just loses them eventually. She also knows that I have a secret stash, and if she happens across anything hidden she will still use it like normal. The change is that when I initially started doing this she would ask when she needed something and and lost hers, and I would give in and give her whatever she was looking for.

These little things are one of the infuriating parts of marriage. It\u2019s obviously not going to ruin the relationship but I hate how inconsiderate my wife can be with my stuff. \n\nI have a jacket that I owned for like ten years. She put it on to take out the trash once and broke the zipper and tore a hole in it trying to unstick it. \n\nI bought us both these electric travel mugs - she never remembers to charge hers so she takes mine and then\u2026doesn\u2019t charge it. \n\nIn these cases it\u2019s perfectly fine to have your stuff and she has her stuff!", "Nta.  That would be super frustrating.", "NTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t even petty, it\u2019s completely understandable.\n\nI would loose my mind if I lived with someone like that!", "NTA- just managing the relationship. Finding the ebb and flow of a 20 year marriage takes commitment, devotion and a bit of insanity", "NTA. I have ADHD and do this a lot. My husband and I both build middle kits that require clippers to cut them away from the runners. I went through 6 pair of these in less than a month bc I would use them and then set them down somewhere and that\u2019s the end of that. My husband made the rule that his clippers are off limits unless I use them under his supervision and literally every time I set them down hand them back to him. This is annoying and a big issue since he often doesn\u2019t want to deal with it so I end up not being able to build my kits unless I go buy yet another set of clippers. \n\nI also understand completely why he does it and it has helped me keep up with mine some. The last pair I bought lasted a whole 3 months before I lost them. \n\nRegardless of the reason she does it, it\u2019s a problem for you and you aren\u2019t wrong for putting up boundaries so you don\u2019t have to suffer from her lack of being able to keep up with things. I do think there might be some things you could do to help her get better though that you might want to try doing.", "NTA, it is probably saving your sanity, lol.\n\nYou would think by now she would be more careful, but she will have to figure it out.

You\u2019ve brought this up to her multiple times and it continued to be a problem. You\u2019ve resorted to the one thing that seems to work, so I don\u2019t blame you for that. But you really need to sit down with her and discuss things a bit more in depth. \n\nAlso speaking as someone who\u2019s researching neurological disorders, it might also be helpful to receive medical advice. While being forgetful about item placement doesn\u2019t seem like a huge issue, if this is a consistent problem, it could be the result of a memory-related deficit. The way the brain converts events into memories is pretty complex and is kinda different depending on if it\u2019s short-term, long-term, active, passive, and other things. This could be nothing to be concerned about, but I\u2019d recommend getting a referral to a neurologist.", "NTA\n\nUsing someone else's deodorant is disgusting btw.", "NTA.

How big is your place or how many closets and drawers do you have where nothing she loses can be found...and your stash can't be found either?\n\nBut NTA.", "NTA But I have to say it\u2019s weird that your wife would want to use your deodorant and wear your underwear. But to each their own. I\u2019m surprised it took you this long to do this. I\u2019d have done the same much earlier.", "NTA. I'm still convinced that a Jack & Jill style bathroom has saved my partner and I a ton of argument. He's lousy at putting things back where they were, but luckily he doesn't use things out of my drawers and spaces without asking. \n\nIf Jen really can't seem to control this, hiding or locking things up doesn't seem unreasonable or petty. But this does seem a bit out of the norm assuming she's generally a considerate person. Obviously reddit shouldn't be diagnosing your wife from this limited bit of information, but this kind of behavior is consistent with several conditions. \n\nWhat is her reasoning for using your things without asking? Do you have separate drawers/closet space, etc?", "NAH\n\nSo Jen sounds neurodivergent (my guess is something attention deficit, but she's needs to look into this for herself). A therapist can help her find coping mechanisms for this kind of executive dysfunction.", "For all the people suggesting Jen suffers from some sort of condition, would you genuinely be asking this if the genders were reversed?

I have a white board in my closet called my Where Is My? Board.

Especially if it\u2019s out of character. If OP told us his wife was generally a bitch, like called people names, stole money out their wallets, kicked puppies, AND used all his deodorant, then I\u2019d be less likely to suggest ADHD, because that person just doesn\u2019t seem to care about anyone else in general. But if she\u2019s an otherwise very caring, unselfish person, that suggests that the problem here is caused by something *other* than just lack of respect for her husband and his things.

And yet...", "You need to go and you will be late if you don't leave now, as you walk out you see the deodorant, grab it and walk towards where you are leaving.

Any of these things happen because you need deodorant, but you are not paying attention to the deodorant.", "Thank you for posting--a family member was just diagnosed with ADHD and your board could be of use to them!", "This is why I bought my husband a beautiful box that sits in the entry. His wallet and keys belong there. Occasionally he leaves his wallet under the seat in his car but otherwise he drops his wallet and his keys there as soon as he walks in.

This behavior impacts you, and it seems not so much the borrowing as it is the lack of replacement so that your things are there when you need them.

If you and your wife seriously think she may have ADHD, she needs to go to the doctor. It\u2019s not the responsibility of your extended family.", "Female ADHD is often missed because it doesn't present the same way, and young girls are taught to behave from a young age in ways that masks the symptoms. If the professionals are not actively evaluating her for ADHD, they may not have picked up on it because of familiarity. This inattentive behavior is negatively affecting both of your lives. It's time to get an evaluation done: not by a family member or someone already familiar with your wife. If she has ADHD, she doesn't have to be on stimulant medication if she doesn't want to be, it's much easier for adults to learn adaptive behaviors to combat this inattentive behavior. \n\nThere are now apps that can help. They could also help even if she is not ADHD. She also could find a life coach who could work with her to develop habits that can prevent misplacing items.
