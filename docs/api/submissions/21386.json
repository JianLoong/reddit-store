It's been great waking up in the morning and getting into the pool and doing some laps. Or sitting in the jacuzzi part when I want to unwind. I'm childfree. I have twin sisters (30F) who both have kids under 8. Mike and Mitch on Megan's side as well as Rachel, Rob and Roxy who belong to Rava. \n\nI love my nieces and nephews, they're great however Robin has her moments. Very much believes she is the \"queen of the world\". It's cute at first but gets very tiring having her compared to my other nieces/nephews. She takes a lot of energy to watch compared to the others who are a bit quieter. Me and my sisters joke about this a lot, how high energy she is.\n\nSo I hosted a BBQ the other day. Rava was busy talking to our friends and family and Rachel wanted to get into my pool. I initially was going to say yes since I bought them all swimsuits to keep at my house but I realised that Robin would also want to get into the pool and I knew she would be a handful with only myself to watch her. So I said no, that I was too busy with the BBQ. The rest of the kids kept asking me through out the day and I still said no until they left.\n\nMegan texted me about the BBQ later saying it was nice to see me and asked why I didn't let any of the kids in the pool since I did ask her about what swim trunks and armbands her boys might find cool. So, I joked about the truth, that I knew Robin would want to jump in and would be hard for me to contain her energy. I thought she'd agree and find it funny but she thought it was mean of me to deny her kids access to the pool just because of Robin and it's not fair for me to punish any of them for it. I told her that I didn't think I could watch all of them at once and I did it for their safety and for her so that she wouldn't have to stop socialising with our friends and family. \n\nWe argued back and forth for a while and eventually agreed to disagree but now I can't stop thinking about whether I was wrong and I was indeed punishing the rest of them. Robin is a lot to handle on land. Around water with the other kids?

My kids are both under 5. If they\u2019re in the pool, I\u2019m in the pool. Accidental drowning is the number one cause of death in kids under 5. The appropriate response from your sister should have been, \u201cI will supervise the kids if you allow them to swim in your pool.\u201d Period.", "If you aren't able to supervise the children properly then they can't be in the pool. It sounds like the right call to me. If my sister were hosting a BBQ and my kids wanted to play in the pool, I'd expect to be the one supervising them. I guess if I were your sister, I would have liked the option, though. I feel like they must have been asking her too? IMO, it's weird that she didn't ask you then if she could allow her children in the pool under her supervision. Sounds like she expected you to supervise her kids in the pool while she socialized?", "NTA, but you need to come up with rules when you have party guests.\n\nWe have a pool and bought a cowbell on a lanyard. During parties, we would specifically assign an adult to watch the kids and have them wear the bell around their neck. If they wanted to leave or take a break, they had to hand the bell off. We made all kids and adults agree to immediately leave the pool if the adult rang the bell (for emergency, break if another adult wasn't readily available, lunch time, etc.). Any kid that broke the rules had to stay out of the pool until the adult allowed them back in. We never had an adult fail to watch the kids. Anytime the kids wanted to go into the pool, we always got shouts \"who's on cowbell duty?\" and they went around to find the adult who would start the first watch.", "NTA!!!! \n\nYoung kids and pools are a potentially terrifying combination. You really do need to have eagle eyes because they can get into trouble quickly and very quietly. \n\nIdeally you should have been able to have one of your siblings watch the kids whilst you were at the grill or vice versa. But your pool = your responsibility to ensure a safe environment. And if Megan didn\u2019t step up to be lifeguard, she\u2019s got no room to complain.", "NTA\n\nBut change the rule. \u201cI will not be supervising your children in the pool. The children can only go in the pool if you are actively supervising them.\u201d", "NTA,\n\nSupervising children takes priority and your logic is sound as to why nobody could swim.

Your sister should have no problem understanding that!", "Your pool your rules.\nOh sorry ya kid drowned while I was basting some ribs won't settle well", "NTA, your house, your pool.  At parties like this so many people get distracted while watching the kids.  I would suggest getting a pool cover for times like this.  It is a pain to take on and off but makes it easier to say no.", "NTA, and I guarantee that as time goes on there will be more and more pressure put on you by these unthinking, selfish relatives to let the kids go swimming.\n\nBut they won't be watching them. That's all on you. And then some kid will have an accident.\n\nIf you're smart, you'll stop inviting these people over. Don't let them just \"drop in,\" either.

I have a similar relationship with my sisters. Maybe in the future you can let your sister know if her kids are asking for something that you can't provide, but she can if she chooses to? My response might have been, \"I can't watch you in the pool right now, but if one of your other grown-ups can get in with you guys you can swim!\" \nBut also, maybe you don't want kids in your pool without your supervision, and that's ok too!

I just like don't want anything to happen to them if there's no one properly watching them", "Other than the parents I would not trust another adult at a party.  So easy to get distracted.", "I grew up in a house with a pool. You are absolutely in the right. There needs to be a strict policy that no kid swims without a responsible adult (or teenager) paying attention. Just make it a house rule and make the kids responsible for acquiring an adult.", "Who is Robin? She\u2019s not in the list of children. Who is her parent and why are they not responsible for supervising?", "NTA. My parents have a pool. I almost drowned when I was 3. People were outside and nobody saw me go under. Not sure how long I was down there, but im lucky my mom noticed me at the bottom of the pool and got me out in time. I dont have any brain damage, so I got really lucky. However you need to make sure everyone who goes in your pool knows how to swim. Adults can supervise you, but things can happen in a split second if you get distracted. It's hard to enjoy the time at a pool when your constantly tasked with watching a kid. And lastly, swim diapers do NOT hold all the pee and fecal matter in. So please do not allow little ones in the pool", "Next time send the kids to ask their parents to supervise as you are unable to. \n\nParents come &stay= kids can get in the pool, parents don't , then the kids don't get to go in the pool. Simple and gets you off the hook.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Make the rule that only kids with parents either directly in or at the pool watching them can go in. You don't want the anxiety before or nightmare after anything happened.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy didn't Megan offer to watch the kids while they were in the pool?", "Exactly"]}
