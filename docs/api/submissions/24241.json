She loved them and showed them off to her paternal cousins (my husband's sister's three sons), and anytime they visit our house, they would fawn over the cute hamsters for hours at end. Due to lack of space upstairs, we kept the hamsters downstairs at a spot next to the kitchen.\n\nOne day, on one of their visits, I was upstairs folding the laundry and came downstairs to get a drink, only to find that the cage was drowning in water and soggy hamster bedding, and those poor hamsters also partially drenched by the mess and hiding in higher ground. I know for a fact that none of my own kids did it because they were all upstairs taking a nap (after a long day at school doing their annual sports event), The only ones who were downstairs were the three boys, and my housemaid knows better than to meddle with the cage because she has never handled small animals like hamsters before.\n\nNaturally I confronted them all three and asked who it was that wet the cage. None of them admitted to doing it, and my housemaid couldn't tell me who it was because it all happened when she was out on a grocery run. I made them stand at the corner of the room within my sights and made them watch as I cleaned the cage and lectured them about how dangerous and irresponsible it is to do such a thing especially to small animals like hamsters. I also told them they're not allowed to leave their spot (not even to sit down) until someone fessed up and come clean.\n\nThey literally stood there quietly without saying a word for almost an hour, until their father came to fetch them home after work. When he saw them standing there and me vigilantly watching them while I cleaned the cage, he looked visibly annoyed, especially after I told them the reason I made them stand there. His eldest son, upon seeing his father, started crying and confessed that he was the one who did it, and he did it because his younger brothers dared him to do it. Even more annoyed (obviously at me rather than at his boys), he just quickly took his boys away from the spot, hastily bundled them into the car while muttering angrily at them and drove off.\n\nLater that night, my MIL got an angry text from my SIL that I was being a AH, that even though her kids had done something wrong, I had no right to scold or punish them and that I was making such a big deal about a bunch of \"tiny rats\". My MIL was on my side on this, but my SIL insist that I was overreacting and overstepping my boundaries as an aunt-in-law.

God those kids are going to be insufferable if their parents don't parent.", "NTA. If one doesn't view this as respect for animals (due to the Asian culture), there should at least be respect for other people's property, especially in their homes (Vietnamese here, but I believe respect for others, especially elders, is common practice in many Asian cultures).", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t leave her kids with someone who can\u2019t discipline them.

That\u2019s a teachable moment. It\u2019s not like you tortured them. You didn\u2019t even make them clean it up themselves.\n\nI\u2019d ban the SiL outright.

Animals should not be mistreated.  .the punishments seemed age appropriate.\n\nIf you are providing some form of baby sitting but are not allowed to use age appropriate discipline with children, I would stop doing this favor for your extended family.
