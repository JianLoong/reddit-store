It will make everything look worse when things come out in the open.  And they always do.\n\nIf your sister was so concerned abut custody, maybe she should have been acting like a parent to her 2 year old child, not pushing her responsibilities onto two teenagers.  Your mother was also wrong for not dealing with the situation and telling Thelma to step up to the plate.  And finally, your father is in the wrong here, because he obviously saw what was happening and did nothing.  You and your brother are not to blame in any way for this situation.\n\nI'm glad your sister is in a panic.  maybe she'll wake up and realize that her child needs to come first, and she needs to be responsible for him.  And your mother needs to get over herself and quit with the silent treatment - that is a form of emotional abuse.\n\nSorry you are dealing with this.  The adults in your life need to grow up.", "Definitely NTA for telling the truth.  I'm glad your father sees the wisdom in this and supports your honesty.  If your sister is so concerned about having custody of her son, she will make sure she is there to tend him.  That is what good mothers do as best they can. Somehow, I don't expect this to happen though.  Hopefully his father can provide a better home environment and parental support of this little guy and you and your brother can be free to enjoy your teenage years.", "NTA.  You told the truth.  Nothing wrong with that.  They should be mad at themselves for putting you in that situation.", "NTA. Would your mother really want you to lie? You might also remind both your mother and your sister that this probably won\u2019t be the last time CPS asks to speak with you and you won\u2019t be lying about how they are treating you. Document everything.", "NTA at all! Your father sounds like the only adult with any sense in this situation. I'm thinking good thoughts for you, your brother and Jon.", "NTA because it's called **Child Protective Services** for a reason.", "NTA.  You nephew is not your responsibility.  Good for you for telling the truth", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing by being honest and telling the truth. You didn't make them look like bad parents, they did that themselves.", "NTA at all. It is not your responsibility to take care of your sisters child. You are a child yourself. Your mom is horrible for making you be pretty much the primary caretaker of your nephew and not holding your sister accountable. Your sister needs to learn the consequences of her actions. Unfortunately she has to learn it the hard way since her parents won\u2019t parent her properly.", "I just learned what \"smash\" meant yesterday. Thanks Reddit. Your sister doesn't seem to want to parent, why does she even want custody? Is it some kind of revenge against the ex? NTA. Always tell the truth. Good on you and lil bro.", "NTA and you genuinely did the right thing.", "NTA. You didn't set this situation up; the adults did. \n\nI'm not surprised they want to blame you for the consequences of their abuse - they probably didn't expect you to tell the truth, and good on you for choosing to protect yourself and the other kids.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird they were concerned about a 16 y/o and 13 y/o being home without parents, IMO.  But you were absolutely right to spill the beans on the parental neglect of the 2 y/o.", "NTA, you told the truth and you're right to be upset with both your sister and your parents. Now they face the consequences of their actions.", "NTA\n\nI am so proud of you.  You were very brave to tell the truth.  It woke up your mom to what was happening, and it shined the light on your sister and what she does.  Your nephew is probably better off with a loving father than an absent mother.  Good luck with everything OP.", "Nta why the heck does she even *want* custody??", "NTA", "NTA and ask both your mother and sister why does she wants more custody time?! To go out and let you +your brother babysit her child? \n\nShe needs to grow tf up and take on her responsibility as a mother before having fun.", "It sounds like your little nephew would be safer and happier if his custody is with his father.  Well done for doing the right thing.  Is there anyway you can support your BIL?", "NTA.\n\nYour sister likes having a kid, not being a parent.  \n\nNo offense, but you and your brother trying to raise your nephew isn't healthy for any of you.  You're a good person for doing what you could to take care of Jon.  Admitting the truth to CPS so they can take action was the right thing to do.", "NTA.  Call CPS on your mother.  You\u2019re being parentified in your home.", "NTA you didn't sign up to be a teen parent to your nephew. Your sister needs to calm her hormones and raise her own child!", "You\u2019re NTA, but for the future, be mindful about what you say and to whom. \n\nFrom here on out, you and your brother only talk to CPS, your sister\u2019s lawyer, or her ex-boyfriend\u2019s lawyer with your father or your father\u2019s lawyer present. Don\u2019t talk to your mom, your sister, or the boyfriend about it at all. Not everyone is ethical, and unethical people may try to bait you into saying what they want you to.  Because you are still pretty young, you may not have the life experience to recognize if someone is trying to manipulate you until it\u2019s too late. \n\nFor example: I was interviewed many years ago by a CPS person (probably not in your state) who was completely incompetent (as in, their office made the newspaper for incompetence).  It was as a witness as I don\u2019t have kids. The agent tried to bait me into saying something incriminating about one of the people involved. I shut them down as hard as I could, but it was so clumsy and so obvious an attempt to manipulate me that it was like a moustache-twirling villain in an old movie. After that I refused to talk with CPS at all because I couldn\u2019t trust them. (Edit to add: please don\u2019t interpret this as all CPS people are incompetent idiots\u2026I got the proverbial bad apple\u2026only as an example about why you should not talk to anyone without your dad or your lawyer present.)\n\nYour situation really sucks and I\u2019m sorry for you and your brother. You\u2019re still a kid\u2014it\u2019s not your job to clean up messes for the adults.", "NTA this would be your parents for allowing your older sister not to be parenting her child.  Her baby daddy contacted CPS which meant that what he said was credible.  They came to visit unannounced and found he had told them the truth.  Your sister wasn't there, they had two teens and no adults watching the child at all times (even though you could babysit you were not paid to nor was your brother).  \n\nUnfortunately your parents, especially your mom needs to get her head out of her ass, to put it mildly and your sister needs to grow the eff up.  The baby daddy will get 50/50 or whatever they determine because your sister was stupid enough to put it all on social media.  \n\nYou and your brother are not to blame for the adults being stupid.", "Leaving 2 teenagers to watch a toddler. Not cool. Dangerous potentially. NTA. Your parents and sister are.", "NTA  \n\n\nthe parents actions make them seem like bad parents, this is just them having consequences for their lack of actions", "NTA\n\nYou told the truth.  If Jon\u2019s father wants custody of Jon, and can provide a loving home, then I hope Jon will be happy to spend more time at his father\u2019s house.", "NTA. She's going to lose custody of the child now. This is probably the best thing for the child. You're not making them look like bad parents. They *are* bad parents.", "Technically, you are old enough to occasionally watch your brother. Do you have to watch him a lot?\n\nAnd Thelma is a bad parent. Why have a child and never be home for him because you are looking for your next conquest? Uf the ex is not using the child as a pawn, the boy is probably better off with his dad.", "Nta, but you\u2019re letting your dad off the hook when he absolutely doesn\u2019t deserve it. He is also in charge of taking care of you, and is just as responsible for Jon as your mom.", "Gentle Yta.you  have no idea what types of problems you started.  I understand that you don't want to watch a child. But  Cps is notorious for removing the wrong kids and letting ones who really need their help die. Let me be clear you and your sibling shouldn't be watching a kid. Also Cps had no business talking to minor children without your parents consent.  Also they might come after your parents for their part. Cps is not anyone best interest.", "Child Protective Services regularly take children and sell them into trafficking. So if the child is taken particularly at such a young age, that is their life ahead of them. \n\nHowever, you, a minor did not know that and simply told the truth so obviously you are NTA. Your parents and sister are entirely responsible for this situation.", "NTA for telling your truth but think this through. \n\nYou spoke up because you resent babysitting. Fine. Plenty of teenagers babysit so unsure why this is the crime of the century. \n\nIn the meantime, there is an ex who is manipulative enough to call CPS and complain about care. You provide care so you know that the baby is safe. This was ex\u2019 tactic and strategy to win. Do you think that ex will stay at home with the baby if he wins custody? Unlikely!\n\nWhat I am saying is that it\u2019s an AH move to help stick a child with a parent who plays dirty just because you dislike babysitting. Nowhere in this story do you explain why the child would be better off living with the ex. This story is about you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is hard to be TA when being truthful; not impossible but hard.", "NTA, your sister is neglecting Jon and leaving you and your brother to handle it. You told the truth.", "NTA - your nephew deserves better care from his mother and grandmother and you deserve to live a life without being turned into a parent for your nephew.  The fact that your own mother isnt speaking to you speaks loud volume about her maturity and morals.  Glad your Dad is more level headed. \n\nBtw - would your nephew be better off with his father who is fighting for custody ?", "NTA, actually the heroes. \n\nYour sister is neglecting her son and taking advantage of you, your brother, and your parents. Your parents are wrong to expect you and your brother to watch your nephew when your sister will not. Boundaries need to be set in your home, and it's not your job to set them. Never feel bad for telling the truth, especially when it might help an innocent child. Hopefully, this is the wake-up call your sister needs to start acting like a parent. Maybe CPS will offer her parenting classes.... but this is not your worry. You did the right thing.", "Where is the sister when she isn't home?  At a job? Searching for a job? At school? Training class? Or who knows?  That might make a difference on a CPS report.", " NTA. Ask your mother and sister what is it was you lied about? What did you say that wasn\u2019t true?

What were a 16 year old and a 13 year old supposed to do? They're home by themselves with a 2 year old, and if they were to have even tried hiding anything from CPS, they probably would have figured it out sooner or later. \n\nThis is completely on Thelma for not being a responsive parent and for their mom to allow her daughter to get away with her behavior. I hope Thelma's ex is a much better person and that the kid can be happy there.", "I wonder if the sister is panicking because she was planning on the child support payments which she won't have if she loses custody.", "I have a feeling that dad's little talk with the lawyer is going to involve mommy's walking papers.  And with a CPS charge of neglect on record, I do not see her making out all that well on custody.", "Probably the child support money she'd get if she won custody.", "16 year olds may work as babysitters, but they get paid. And they get to choose when they take/don't take a job. This 16 year old and her brother are being used as free childcare while a baby's mother goes off and does whatever. Also, Occasionally keeping an eye on a kid in your family is one thing; being forced to give up your teen years is another. Take it from me. I spent most of high school taking care of my siblings and being the substitute parent. \n\nOh and OP you are NTA! You did the 100% right thing.", ">It's weird they were concerned about a 16 y/o and 13 y/o being home without parents, IMO.\n\nI agree. I was babysitting when I was 12.

Don't 16 year Olds work as babysitters?", "Child support checks?", "You're really supporting the neglectful moms over their children? Seriously?", "What are you smoking? That\u2019s not true at all. In fact, CPS doesn\u2019t want to remove children if they don\u2019t have to and make efforts to avoid that if possible.", ">In the meantime, there is an ex who is manipulative enough to call CPS and complain about care.\n\nWe have *no* idea why the ex called CPS. I'm not sure why you're automatically calling it manipulative instead of him being genuinely worried about his child. I mean, the fact that CPS is displeased with this situation should be enough to tell you that the ex had a legitimate reason to call them, shouldn't it? Can he still be manipulative? Absolutely, but we only have OP's view of things based on what they know, and they openly admit to Thelma frequently leaving her kid in their care-we don't know what the ex notices when the kid is in his care or if he's seen any other concerning behavior of Thelma's. \n\n>Do you think that ex will stay at home with the baby if he wins custody?

This way she gets money to go out and screw around cause we all know it's not going to be for baby.", "Maybe because they are forced to take care of a child in their own detrimento? It's not about them being alone, but they taking care of a child for too much time.", "Yup, sounds about right.", "Again...16 year Olds babysit...overnight on some cases.  Unless this area has some odd laws being left in the care of a 16 year old is not out of the ordinary.", "It's about parentification. Making the 16 watch a baby without compensation is not babysitting,  as babysitters get paid, and cannot ve full time nanny.", "It doesn't count as babysitting when you're being forced to be a third parent. OP claims the sister has next to nothing to do with her own child and she's doing all the watching. That's not babysitting.", "Patentification isn't illegal.  A 16 year old watching her young relatives  would not be something CPS would give a damn about.", "Doesn't matter from a legal standpoint.  The child is being cared for by someone legally old enough to be left alone and in charge of young children.", "Incorrect, it's considered neglect and emotional abuse.", "CPS knows the laws a bit better than you who doesn't even know where OP lives anyway.", "Nope.  Not even close.  The child is being cared for by a member of the family.  Is it shitty?  Absolutely.  But not illegal which is why CPS did not even attempt to take the kids.", "It pertains to the neglect they are already investigating, doesn't mean that it's not neglect or abuse. Sometimes CPS needs sufficient evidence before acting, and as they have another hearing it's entirely possible that charges will be brought to the mom and the sister for it, and will lend credence to the loss of parental rights of the sister. \n\nDepending on what state this is in, parentifcation is definitely illegal. They are darn lucky the kids didn't get taken.", "Hardly."]}
