I'm also always going there straight from work since it's right afterwards, so I'm dressed a little nicer in my work clothes. \n\nA few years ago, for a few different reasons, I decided to stop buying clothes and now exclusively make my own. A lot of my stuff tends to have a little more of a vintage/historical flair, so it's a little unusual and people comment on it occasionally. \n\nBecause of that, occasionally I'll come in with a new outfit that I'm pretty excited about since I just finished making it, and my friend or the waitress at the bar (who also knows I make everything) will ask me if it's new and I say yes and there's not usually much else to the conversation. A few times when this happens one of the people at the table (we'll call her Kelsey) will kinda roll her eyes or give me a dirty look.\n\nThis past week I wore a dress I made a few months ago that I'm still fairly proud of, and when I walked in the waitress made a joking comment to me along the lines of \"Wow, that looks like it was custom made for you by a tailor\" I answered that it was. I thought it was pretty clear from our tones that we were joking, but Kelsey must not have picked up on it. \n\nI don't remember exactly what she said because it felt rather sudden, but it was something along the lines of \"we get it, you're rich. Stop rubbing it in. Not everyone can afford designer clothes and custom made dresses.\" I told her that I wasn't rich, and that the joke was that I AM a tailor, and I made the dress for me. It's not designer, it's just not what's typically produced by the fast fashion industry. Fabric is expensive, so most of my clothes are made from fabric that was given to me by my grandmother before she passed, and tablecloths and bedsheets I either got from her or bought from Goodwill. There is also a local overstock discount fabric shop that I go to sometimes as well. \n\nShe didn't say anything for a while, so I assumed the conversation was over and I waited for Trivia to start, since the table was pretty quiet after that. After a few minutes she said something about how not everyone has time to sit around all day making dresses, and I reminded her that I work full time. Then there was a comment about how not everyone has access to the same resources to learn how to sew, or has a grandmother that could conveniently give them a bunch of fabric, which is true. I'm not denying that there is a systemic level of privilege in being able to go to college for a costume design degree and having a grandmother who could afford nice fabrics. I admitted in that area she did have a point and I apologized, and we went on with the game, though things were pretty awkward after that. \n\nI was just excited about something I'd worked hard on and was proud of, I didn't really intend to rub it in everyone's face and make them think I thought I was better than them.", "created_utc": 1700330858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yc7p4/aita_for_flaunting_my_wealth/", "score": 538, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA.\n\n>not everyone has access to the same resources to learn how to sew  \n  \nThere are, in fact, hundreds of YouTube videos and books (freely available at your local library!) that one can use to learn tailoring. Many libraries even rent out sewing machines. But that\u2019s not really the point, because Kelsey just wanted to be mad for the sake of being mad.", "NTA. She is though, she\u2019s jealous and from the sounds of it just generally hates you. I am considered poorer than many and I would have had no issue with your resourcefulness or getting excited about your clothing. She\u2019s a particular type of person that I hate. Pretend she doesn\u2019t exist, she\u2019s got a variation of \u201cmain character syndrome\u201d where she thinks everything is about her, and everyone else is the villain.

And have nothing to be sorry about.\n\nAlso if youre looking to make a side career out of designing clothes - and it sounds like everyone is into or jealous of your stuff, you could offer to tailor something for them if they pay you and take on jobs?", "Oh god, NTA.\n\nMy wife's undergrad degree is in studio art / textile design (with a minor in photography).  She makes my shirts.  They are *fabulous*, and I do absolutely flaunt them (at work and elsewhere).\n\nI have never, *never* encountered an attitude like Kelsey's.", "NTA.

That is very impressive as I barely can sew the few holes or rips my kids got in a few stuffed animals or pajamas. \n\nYour friend got bothered by something, and she kept being bothered by something at every turn. If this is normal behavior, I feel sorry for her.

No one cares.  Get a life and mind your business Kelsey!\n\nHer feelings of inferiority are on her - not you.\n\nYou do you.  Haters gonna hate.  Fuck her.", "NTA.

You shouldn't dim your own light to make others comfortable. Plus there are lots of ways they can learn to sew, if they wanted to. There are even lots of tutorials on Youtube but if they really wanted to do it they would. The truth is they're not interested in sewing they just don't want you to receive the positive and well-deserved attention your talent gives you.", "NTA. This person is ridiculous and rude. You have NOTHING to apologize for. She\u2019s jealous and chippy.", "Absolutely NTA I work full time in an unrelated field and I taught myself how to sew as a hobby. I've made a couple of things including a beautiful dress which took me forever to make and I was so proud of it. If someone told me I was flaunting my wealth cause I used my free time to learn a new skill they can go fuck themselves.", "NTA. Sounds like your friend is feeling jealous and really needs it to be your fault. If you are not flaunting your wealth, you are flaunting *something*. She would have gone on till she found it. Not everyone has hands to sew with, so you are showing off.", "NTA. I would have asked if I could pay you to make me a dress, and compliment you on skills I sorely lack in, not hate on you for investing in those skills and using what your grandmother passed down to you. Kelsey is a miserable person and she ruined Trivia night by making it awkward for everyone, especially you.", "It sounds like Kelsey just doesn't like you and is looking for a reason to justify it. I applaud the talent of being able to sew, I'm learning myself. NTA.", "When somebody is determined to take offense, you can't stop them. Ignore the jealous crap.

Someone\u2019s mad they don\u2019t want put forth the effort to learn a new, useful, skill and wants to tear you down for enjoying your own hard work. What a sour grape.", "People who are poor enough to have to make the same clothes last for years and years of growing children, worn threadbare winter coats, torn and patched up spots, etc are just as likely to learn how to sew skillfully as well as \"privileged\" people, and just because your friend got it in her head that \"new clothes = lots of money being spent = I am having wealth flaunted in my face\" and decided to keep trying to dig her way out of the hole she made when she found out she was making assumptions doesn't mean sewing is suddenly privileged behavior jesus fuck.\n\nNTA, but I wonder if your friend has a stick up hers.", "NTA Certainly kept moving the goalpost of blame didn't she. Rich, time, your granny died. What next? She was born with a predisposition to hangnails that catch on fabric?", "NTA. \n\nShe was looking to knock you down but was so naff at it that it took her three goes to even get close.  That'll be why everyone seemed awkward - wondering wth she was doing. \n\nHonestly, I'd be tempted to make something even nicer to wear to Trivia and just not mention it next time - \"Oh, this old thing?\" - but I might be a bit of a stirrer in this sort of situation. That's if she's even invited - might be unlikely after her recent behaviour.", "NTA, the other comments she made were her trying to save face and make you look bad not likely actual criticisms she or anyone else believes. You didn't do anything wrong", "NTA. You should be proud of the fact you make your own clothing. Just because Kelsey doesn't like it or can't afford it or doesn't have the resources, that doesn't give her the right to be a downer and put you down. She needs to mind her own business or learn how to sew herself, maybe she can make her own clothes so she's not so worried about what you're doing.  You aren't doing anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nShe assumed wrong and doubled down on it.\nYou should be proud, we don't let people be proud of their achievements as adults and it's sad.", "Kelsey should save up for a new wardrobe, green is a terrible colour on her.   \nNTA, she's jealous and bitter.", "There are seasons of contestants of Project Runaway and its associated series of folks that taught themselves how to sew.\n\nIt used to be that you learned some basics in Home Ec - which is called something else now. My older brother went to a private school and excelled at doing repairs - which he learned on his own.\n\nNTA", "NAH. She's taking her insecurities out on you, and would've probably kept going to find some way in which you were more \"privileged\" than her so that she could hold it over you, and guilt-trip the joy out of it.", "**NTA**   She's jealous and all her friends know it too.   You have every right to be proud of your skills.   Stop engaging with her on the topic.", "She's just extremely jealous and hoped with her poorly aimed rebuttal to feel better about herself. It's just projecting she's jealous of your nice clothes. Take it as a compliment and leave it. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s jealous. She called you out for \u201cflaunting your wealth,\u201d and got knocked down when she learned you made it. Then she doubled-down with what she thought was an insult about your privilege.  \n\nWhat you really are is resourceful and hard-working. If she has time for trivia, she has time to learn to sew.", "NTA. She could\u2019ve said it was a nice outfit but chose to be bitter instead. When you pointed out their assumptions were incorrect they just kept trying to come up with new ones until they found one that seemed to fit. They just wanted to pick a fight.", "Do  not let someone else steal your joy! Plain and simple. NTA", "NTA and it really just sounds like she\u2019s jealous. Please know that whatever answer you gave she was going to nitpick - that\u2019s on her. Be proud of your designs and flair for fashion.

Don\u2019t let it stop you from enjoying life.", "They assumed, you corrected them, that should\u2019ve been the end of it. That she kept finding reasons for her to be justified rather than accepting she made a mistake in judgment is embarrassing. This is trivia not twitter. NTA", "This is ridiculous. First accusation too much money. Second, too much time. Third, too much family support. WTAF. She is a bitter bitter horrible woman who can\u2019t back off or know when to shut up. Why did you apologise for your life to her? She does not need an apology, she needs to be told that not everyone is bitter about others around them and can\u2019t handle being around anyone that has any positive aspect to their life.", "NTA.

I mean, one most people would be able to answer. \n\nMy son's friend is on the spectrum and knows pretty much the flag to every country except Botswana, I think!", "My mother was a designer, and I always, and she always had the best tailored clothes, her own designs copies of other designs. I was always well dressed at school, and I was made fun of because I dressed a little bit nicer than everybody without really actually meaning to so I understand exactly what you\u2019re saying because when I got older and started working, my mother made me suits for work and dresses she made stuff when I was pregnant and it saved me money of course and she would get the offcut fabrics from work And she would make everything from baby shirts to ballgowns.", "Get you.  I bet they are gorgeous .   \n\nMy mother made lovely clothes , having been taught in London in the 50s.   She tried to teach me. ...  but I  am left handed so between her and school lessons I am scarred for life lol.", "Keep kicking ass OP.", "I don't blame you, a bit. I always said that I got my dress/skirt/ top, at Woolworth's. \nTechnically, true.  LOL  They had some great deals on fabrics!", "Exactly. My mom (and I love her) was full on hippie. My dad taught me to cook, my neighbor inspired me to learn to sew. It wasn't privilege, it was a desire to learn.", "Yeah, sheesh, OP wasn\u2019t having nice clothes AT Kelsey. What\u2019s the implication here\u2014no one should have anything unless Kelsey can have the same thing?  That\u2019s the mentality of a toddler.", "It sounds like Kelsey wants to win the victim Olympics.\n\nEverything that's not going on in her life is obviously someone elses fault! /s\n\nNTA.", "Hahaha hopefully you get to use it soon!", "Thank you", "Hahahaha nice! That's awesome!", "Aww that's awesome!! Good for you! And haha I Wish I got offcuts of fabric from work, that sounds awesome", "Thank you \ud83d\udc95\n\nAnd oh wow haha I can only imagine. My mom is left handed and had a similar experience", "Aww haha thank you!!", "HAHA Yeah, sometimes if people ask me where I got something and I'm pretty socially drained, I just say I got it ages ago and don't remember anymore", "Yea, jealous much? Shoot, I got my sisters cheap sewing machine when she died, and self taught myself to make basic outfits for the reenactments I went to. Eventually turned that into part of my full time job making costumes. I didn't even have youtube to teach me, just a few tips from other reenactors. Some people can't accept that others have put in the work to learn something.", "Wow!  Your clothing is spectacular!  \n\nETA: Thank you for sharing them", "My left handed sympathy to your mum \ud83d\ude04", "I miss Woolie's. JoAnn Fabrics has some nice stuff. But, their prices are so high.  I do thrift store treasure hunts, though.  Sometimes, you find designer stuff, by accident. But, I tend to look for off-beat stuff I can cannibalize. I have to go by the Senior Center, and check their store. They usually have some amazing laces, in fun colors!", "I know this was a joke but my great grandma used to teach blind people how to sew and do arts and crafts, \n\nYou don\u2019t need eyes to see \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: ment sew but phone autocorrected it \u2026", "That girl is so jealous of OP.\n\nI wonder if there's a guy involved? Like, someone at the establishment or someone from the group is interested in OP or is a fan of OP's style; but the mean girl is into that guy, and is deathly jealous. And taking any chance she gets to take OP down a peg or two.", "Hahaha I'll let her know", "Yeah \ud83d\ude2d I went to Joanns to get fabric and materials for my Zelda cosplay and it ended up being almost $100. So that's the fabric splurge for a while haha\n\nAnd nice!! That sounds awesome! I have to go thrifting soon haha", "Walmart used to have a good selection of fabrics. Kind is iffy, even on quilting stuff, now. Michael's has some.  It's getting expensive, to make clothing.  The pattern I use for hooded velvet cloaks, I got for $10, years ago. Same pattern is now $30!   A lot of the cosplay patterns are too expensive.", "I live in Chicago, so there's not really a Walmart near me, but there are a few local fabric stores in the city. One is right next to Joann and has about the same prices, one has really nice fabric that is Incredibly Expensive so I've never bought anything from there, and one has a TON of really cheap fabric of Dubious Quality \n\nOh Wow haha, Yikes. I pattern all my own stuff so ig I save money there but Wow, I had no idea patterns were that expensive"]}
