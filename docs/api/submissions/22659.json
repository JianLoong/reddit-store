We have 2 beautiful daughters ages 7 and 5 who share a room and bed. Our 7 year old has been used to co-sleeping with mom her entire life. My wife is a SAHM and used to put the kids to sleep most nights. She basically lays down with then and many times falls asleep with them. Then she would complain that she didn't sleep well, she has no free time, and we don't ever get to spend couple time together (sex, tv, conversation, etc). \n\nA few years ago I got fed up and insisted on creating a bedtime routine for the kids. I slowly weaned them off cuddling and replaced it with storybooks, prayers, and white noise. Over the course of a few months they were used to it and bedtime became a breeze. Then my wife and I started taking turns putting them to sleep. But she took shortcuts with the bedtime routine and just cuddled them to sleep. This effectively ruined my bedtime routine and ability to put them to sleep because now they only want cuddles. Sometimes my wife will half heartedly do the routine but most nights ends up cuddling and falling asleep with them. This is understandable when we're traveling or spending the night at grandparents house, but it's became almost a daily habit for her. Meanwhile my job gets harder and the kids stay up till midnight craving cuddles. I have to start the weaning process every week. \n\nLast night my wife was exhausted so I offered to put the kids to sleep. She had been putting them to sleep for the past week when I was traveling for work so they were used to the cuddles. I went through the routine and cuddled with them for a little, then left the room. Each time they walked out I gently took them back in a firmly told them it's bedtime and they have to sleep. After a few rounds of this, older daughter started crying because she wanted her mom. My miserably exhausted wife jumped in the bed with them and started accusing me of being good for nothing, not a dependable partner, abusive father, etc. I lost my temper and pulled the covers off her and the kids and told her enough is enough, she wouldn't be doing this anymore and needs to go back to her room. I'll put the kids to sleep no matter how long it takes. Kids are crying seeing mom and dad in a shouting match. My wife threatens to call 911 and accidentally hits dial. They call her back and she says she's in danger. Police show up at 1am and start lecturing us for a good 20 mins on marriage. Thankfully nobody is arrested and they left. I put down a sleeping bag in the kids room and they eventually fall asleep. I go to work the next day with barely any sleep.\n\nI feel incredibly frustrated and betrayed by my wife. We're not talking to each other now, but this has to stop. I'm resolved to fix the kids' sleeping habits as I believe it's unhealthy for their long term growth and its also hurting our marriage.", "created_utc": 1689782835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153z7yq/aita_for_forcibly_putting_an_end_to_my_wifes/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You two need to be on the same page and not argue like children in front of your kids. Your wife's behavior really doesn't bode well for marriage", "NTA but holy shit your wife is.", "ESH. You shouldn't have shouting matches in front of your kids.  But your wife calling 911 was nuts.  Y'all need marriage counseling, and she needs parenting classes.", "NTA. Your wife is not being a good partner. There needs to be compromise especially if you\u2019ve suggested a great routine for the children. These kids will become codependent in so many ways and her escalating the situation by calling 911 is insane. Obviously you shouldn\u2019t have yelled but the frustration is valid. I would have a real conversation and lay everything out on the table:  communication, the kids, escalation of anger. If you can\u2019t come to a consensus then divorce and couples counseling are options. But your wife sounds crazy imo", "NTA overall. You and your wife need to get into agreement. Her way sounds unhealthy for everyone involved. Your way sounds much better, storybooks, prayers, white noise. Perhaps add in a short cuddle. Or better yet, make bedtime your responsibility every night. As a SAHM I'm sure she is exhausted at the end of the day and can't get through a more structured routine other than laying with them.\n\nHowever, yelling at each other in front of the kids is never a good idea, of course. It had to have been bad if your wife called the police. So YTA for that.", "NTA.  But man, your wife needs help.  Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.  Get her to a therapist asap, and then Get yourselves to a marriage counselor.  Your marriage is in BIG trouble.", "This is obviously about more than a bed time routine. If my spouse called 911 on me and lied about being in danger I\u2019d start looking at a lawyer.  What if they had taken her seriously and arrested you? Lying and calling the police when you don\u2019t get your way is insane.", "ESH.\n\nYou need to keep your kids out of the disagreement. Have that conversation with her BEFORE bedtime.", "NTA.  They're too old for this coddling and need to learn to sleep independently.\n\nAnd I would probably be reconsidering things after the 911 call.  Your wife is unhinged.", "Your nta but your wife yes", "Jesus fuck some people shouldn't have kids...", "If your wife told the police she's in danger, it's time to take distance from her. This is very serious. I think it\u2019s healthier for your kids to have separated parents than have their father in jail. NTA.", "NTA - your wife is tho and she\u2019s gonna create absolutely miserable teens / young adults to be around. You\u2019re spot on about breaking the habit now.", "Your wife seems to have some attachment issues, NTAH.", "NTA, maybe ESH for yelling in front of the kids. But dude your kids are 7 and 5 and they still don't know how to fall asleep without all that production?? I totally get why you wanted a routine.", "Your wife needs a life, she's just weird", "ESH. You guys need to talk about this and come to an agreement before executing anything. She was completely wrong for derailing the routine and calling 911. But you shouldnt have started a fight in front of the kids. Honesty, it sounds like you stepped in a bit too late. You have a 7 year old now. So your wife has been surviving like this for that long. It\u2019s probably much easier for her to do this after a long and tiring day. I\u2019d say you should offer to help elsewhere as well to make sure she has enough energy to do this routine. I know you\u2019re tired with work but SAHM is still a full time job as well. You said it yourself that she had communicated that she doesnt have any time or energy. Just talk it out first and hope it goes well for you guys.", "Why do your kids share a bed?", "So, uh, how are ya'll outside of the bedtime routine? Because unless we're missing a whole lot of context, this is just a totally nutso interaction on both of ya'll and I have no idea how you're married to each other. \n\nESH bc oh my God", "ESH. What conversations have you had with your wife regarding the progress you made? Does she recognize the progress? Is she aware that she is allowing the kids to play you two against each other? I am all for bedtime routines for everyone\u2019s health but if you travel for work then you cannot be in charge of bedtime every night. You two have to be on the same page. This starts with the two of you not you overtaking this step in parenting and expecting her to abide by it just because you think it\u2019s better (and it probably is).", "Dude have a firm talk with your wife. Because tbh your wife is on the way to abusing them. She isn\u2019t letting them learn a good and dependent sleep schedule and is risking their development and is increasing the chance to develop anxiety for your daughters with her behaviour. So be firm!", "ESH good lord get a divorce", "ESH\n\nIf she wants to cuddle with the kids, you don't get to stop her. \n\nEven if she is being a colossal AH by criticizing you while undermining you. \n\nBut wtf isn't with the 911 call? She 'accidentally' hit send...and then told them she was in danger? Nonsense. \n\nThe kids sleep schedule is not the problem here. You two need either counseling or divorce.", "INFO: she seems unhinged based on this event. Have there been other times where you let her down or drove her to this drastic decision.\n\nFrom what you have provided, NTA. Kids thrive on routine. I don\u2019t care what anyone says.", "NTA.\n\nYour kids are too old to not be able to go to sleep without mum.\n\nI think your wife needs a serious conversation about why she can't stick to the routine that benefited everybody.\n\nParenting *isn't* giving in and placating kids for an easy life. These are the tough, disciplined things that need to happen to grow as people. \n\nCalled the police is insane.", "ESH. Yes, your kids need to learn to sleep by themselves, but your wife and kids should get a say in the kind of bedtime routine they want. There\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t include cuddles, and it\u2019s super weird that you want to ban your wife from cuddling the kids. You could cuddle for the duration of a bedtime story and then leave the room.\n\nYou are also more of an AH for that whole ripping the covers off your kid while shouting number. That is likely to terrorize your child, as is you refusing to let them see their mother at bedtime. Once you hit that part of your story, you sounded like an absolute monster. It\u2019s hard to believe you can\u2019t see how heinous that is to do to your kid.", "ESH - I was on board with you up to the screaming match in front of the kids.\n\nGet some couples counseling and parenting classes. I'm glad the paramedics chewed you both out.", "NTA. She has issues on this subject.", "ESH. What an embarrassment you both are. Screaming at each other in front of your children, and then calling the cops? And all of this is happening at 1 AM? Y\u2019all need to figure it the fuck out, you\u2019re fucking up your kids", "ESH. Your wife for calling 911 (because wtf) and you for pulling up the covers and start yelling, your kid must freaked out.", "She\u2019s lucky to have you in my opinion, good for you for creating a routine. She needs a reality check on her complaining.", "You two don't seem to respect each other. Reactions on both parts are assholish, ESH. Take care of your drama away from the kids, FFS.", "Nope, this cannot be the whole story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wife should stop agreeing with you if she doesn't agree with you. You don't get to \"forcibly put an end\" to anything your wife does. Unless it's violence. You are not her father. Some food for thought, my daughter used to do the \"I'm scared can I sleep with you\" routine until she was 9. She's 17 now. The other day she woke me up like that crying (nose ring stuck on the pillow case lol) after I fixed it i laid in bed and SOBBED. I hadn't heard that lil knock in so long and it BROKE me. Forget sleep. Cuddle those babies for every second they'll let you.", "Its a man woman thing, i put the kids down 5 minutes snoring, wife puts them down a hour later they are still awake.  Moms are more stimulating than dads", "NTA, we need more men to take charge in this country and teach the youthe discipline and hard work and other important values that are clearly lacking in todays young people\n\nBut also it sounds like your marriage is basically over, she sounds checked out.", "NTA. Gotta align with the wife. And I would get the d papers ready if she is calling cops on you on this bullshit", "It's time for you to go.  She will never let you parent.  She may complain but she doesn't want alone time with you.  Find someone who does.", "I must be superwoman. I was a sahm homeschooling mom of 7 kids and found time every night for a shower and time for a hobby after the kids went to bed.\n\nThis isn't about being tired, this is a woman with a Co dependency problem.\n\nAnd the 911 call?! That's really indicative of a problem! OP had never been violent before and sges now in danger?", "I like the critical thinking of your response. We have discussed this at length for several years. She knows that a good bedtime routine is the right thing to do. She appreciates the extra time for us to kick back and watch tv or get intimate. But most nights when it's her turn she completely abandons the routine and falls asleep cuddling them. Our older daughter is especially affected and has become quite codependent and clingy. Neither of us is in charge of bedtime. We take turns depending on how the other is feeling. If we are both on the same page and firm on this (or any other) routine it'll be better for everyone. I think she also is very compassionate with the kids. But she mistakes the kids' stalling at bedtime and codependency as actual anguish from our daughter. If daughter has a nightmare or can't sleep I have no problem with them cosleeping with their mom or even in our bedroom. But it can't be a daily occurrence.", "I have no problem with cuddles. I cuddle with them as well, hug and kiss them goodnight. My concern is that they are dependent on cuddles with their mom ALL NIGHT. Our older daughter can't sleep and starts crying if either of us leave the room after bedtime routine. My goal is to make bedtime a warm, happy occasion for the kids, but also an efficient process where neither my or I have to spend hours.. and in her case the entire night.", "Not necessarily. We co-slept for longer than we should because my fianc\u00e9 worked nights, we live with family that still work so I needed *my* sleep too. I didn\u2019t have anyone to take over nor could I let the rest of the household be sleep deprived either. Sometimes you just do what you need to survive.\n\nGranted, I don\u2019t agree with what the wife\u2019s done recently but it sounds as if dad stepped up too late. They need to strip it back to basics when he\u2019s got time to do it consistently, not \u2018whoever feels like it\u2019", "You need to discuss your relationship with your wife is calmer. And not at night.\n\nFrankly your entire marriage needs to be discussed. You threw covers off, she called you abusive and then *called 911*, like the whole thing is CRAZY.\n\nYou have deeper issues not related at all to night time routine.\n\nAt those ages, your kids are in school. Confirm? Your wife is probably feeling like she lost her identity somewhere, and sleeping with the 7 yr old all night is some way to make life easier for herself and also give herself purpose. If all night cuddles stop and 7 yr old is fine, that\u2019s one more \u201cproof\u201d that mom isn\u2019t really needed. Which isn\u2019t true, of course, but that might be how she is seeing it. Coupled with you being gone and maybe not helping in the house as much, there\u2019s clearly been a ton of resentment breeding now for ages. \n\nYou need to have a serious convo with her about what the heck is up, why deep down she is fighting this, what she wants to do with her time and life, and get on the same page in your marriage. You should use the 911 call as a trigger for deeper discussion, because yes, you shouldn\u2019t have argued w her in front of the kids while yanking a bed cover off, but HOLY OVER REACTION on her part. Having a cop in your house til 1 am could have ended not so happily and if she\u2019s so quick to play the \u201cabuser!!!\u201d card w the cops, your marriage has BEEN in serious trouble. And it again, ain\u2019t at all about the sleep routine.", "When you two are discussing this during the day, does she express the understanding that your daughter isn\u2019t in any distress at bedtime? Have you two talked about extinction bursts and how it\u2019s normal for the behavior to get worse before it improves and how important it is not to give in? \n\nIf she does understand all of that when it\u2019s not bedtime, maybe she\u2019s just so exhausted that she\u2019d rather give in. She might need more support during the week while you\u2019re gone so she can function better. When you\u2019re really tired it\u2019s hard to have the willpower to make good long-term decisions.", "You're in the right on this, OP. Kids need to learn to self soothe and fall asleep on their own, and they need to learn it at this stage of their lives."]}
