We had not spoken for more than four years. I (22m) was his only surviving kid from his first marriage. My mom and two siblings died in a car wreck when I was 9. My dad and I were in a car behind them so we saw it happen but were not directly involved. After my mom and siblings died my dad focused on moving on and finding a new wife.\n\nHe met Trish 2 months later and they got married after 6 months together. Trish was a single mom of two kids and their dad's were not around so my dad decided he was going to step up and be their dad. He told me I owed it to them to be the best big brother and to learn from my brother and sister who had been amazing older siblings. I said no. I told him I did not agree to being anyone else's sibling and I would only ever have two siblings. He always said I would regret it and he told me he hated me. He had three more kids with Trish and I never tried to bond with them either.\n\nWhen I was 15 dad and I had the fight that was sort of us done for good. He read my sister's diary on what would have been her 18th birthday and he didn't like what he read about her friend having half siblings and he took it out on me. \n\nAfter that it was agreed I should live with my aunt and uncle. But dad would still call sometimes asking me to regret my lack of interest.\n\nTrish is the one who told me he died. She sent me the obituary via social media. I did not go to the funeral but I did see her at my uncle's house. I left once they arrived because I was only there for my uncle.\n\nShe tracked me down a couple of weeks later and told me her kids were asking about me and she said I needed to speak to them and to try and be their older brother. I refused to do it. She told me I need to tell them I regret my actions and miss them and dad and want to be part of the family and that I owe her that much after making life harder when I left and leaving her with young kids who wanted to know why their brother wasn't around. \n\nI told her I don't owe it to her to lie and say something I don't mean. I also told her to leave me alone. She yelled and I walked away from her. She then contacted me on social media again telling me I should be ashamed for treating my dad's widow that way.

Childcare for five kids adds up BIG, she wants to dump that load on OP.", "Wow, that would be incredibly harsh and unnecessary.

It sounds like OP watched their mom and siblings die, then within 2 months, their dad was busy with a replacement mom, son, and daughter. When OP was grieving or wouldn't play along with the fantasy their dad had, they were punished then eventually abandoned. Laying it out from OP's perspective then saying \"I'm sure you're great, but I hope you can respect that I don't want a relationship with you. It's not healthy for me. I'm sorry if dad promised you otherwise, but it wasn't his to promise.
