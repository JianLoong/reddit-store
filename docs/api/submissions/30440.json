After my mom and siblings died my dad focused on moving on and finding a new wife.\n\nHe met Trish 2 months later and they got married after 6 months together. Trish was a single mom of two kids and their dad's were not around so my dad decided he was going to step up and be their dad. He told me I owed it to them to be the best big brother and to learn from my brother and sister who had been amazing older siblings. I said no.

He had three more kids with Trish and I never tried to bond with them either.\n\nWhen I was 15 dad and I had the fight that was sort of us done for good. He read my sister's diary on what would have been her 18th birthday and he didn't like what he read about her friend having half siblings and he took it out on me. \n\nAfter that it was agreed I should live with my aunt and uncle.

I refused to do it. She told me I need to tell them I regret my actions and miss them and dad and want to be part of the family and that I owe her that much after making life harder when I left and leaving her with young kids who wanted to know why their brother wasn't around. \n\nI told her I don't owe it to her to lie and say something I don't mean. I also told her to leave me alone. She yelled and I walked away from her. She then contacted me on social media again telling me I should be ashamed for treating my dad's widow that way.

Toxic is toxic, and let's be honest, anyone who is willing to marry into a situation like that is likely looking for a vulnerable meal ticket or someone easy to manipulate. Hurt people are often vulnerable. You don't owe anyone anything. She is probably looking for someone to maintain her lifestyle, or a place to dump her kids.

When you for obvious reasons did not go along, he lashed out at you and got irrationally mad and could never understand why you couldn't just get on board with this insane strategy.

He wanted desperately for it to work  and you were the awful living obstacle who refused to go along (despite him really needing you on board because from the sound of it he also always thought he did it for you as well and wanted you to be as happy as him as well) and always reminded him of the loss he never properly dealt with.\n\nIt is completely up to you what to do now. He is dead now so to him it does not matter if you forgive him or not. But you should look into whether you want to do it for yourself. You mention your uncle.
