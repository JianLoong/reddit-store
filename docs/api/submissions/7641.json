Did you all have legal documents drafted up for this?", "Why did he tell his family if he isn\u2019t going to be involved?", "NTA, but 2 things to consider -\n\n(1) Get the legal paperwork in order, and have the father sign away paternity.\n\n(2) Think about what might be good for your kid, and not just you. What do the grandparents, etc, want when it comes to \"being involved\" and is it good for your kid?  If they are offering financial support and love, and live 9 hours away - not exactly enough to overstep, you may want to entertain allowing them some trial access while the baby is too young to get attached/know what is going on b/c all-in-all this may lead to fewer issues for your kid down the line. (Do you know anyone whose dad/dad's family was not involved?  Hard to say, but this may spare your kid some heartache down the line. - So with that, I do agree somewhat with your parents.)", "NTA.  FOB (father of baby) is LC for a reason (they are \u2018overbearing\u2019 you stated) - believe him.  Do you want overbearing grandparents that insist you and your baby travel nine hours?   Block them and the FOB, and go about your life.", "NTA because this is basically a sperm donation, and that was the arrangement.\n\nA little advice, though, from one former single mom to another, the more people who love the child, truly love the child, the better the child's life will be. Now and in the future. The love and support of as many people as possible gives that child the best chance at a successful life. Again, loving and supportive people, the quality of the people certainly matters. If they aren't even willing to travel to see their grandchild, then that does not bode well for the supportiveness of the family.", "NTA. If baby dad is basically a sperm donor have him sign away his rights. There is probably a very legitimate reason he is LC with his parents. Make sure in your country they can\u2019t claim grandparent rights. I wish you well on the start of your new family!", "NTA. Honestly, the father didn\u2019t want any involvement. I\u2019m assuming you two came to an agreement before the pregnancy. Would anyone have a right to your child\u2019s time if you had gone to a sperm bank instead? Make the best decision you can based on what kind of people they are.", "NTA - if he\u2019d donated sperm through a sperm bank they wouldn\u2019t be able to track the baby down, this is the same principle. Maybe it would help to get him to explain this to them.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I would look into getting him to sign his rights away once baby is born, I\u2019m not sure exactly how it works, but it would stop things potentially getting messy later on down the line if he suddenly wants to be in the kids life.", "INFO: What's your long term strategy? I assume your friend isn't going to be a father figure, so what are you going to tell your child when they're little? What will you tell them when they're older? Are you planning on pretending that their paternal family doesn't exist? According to you, gossip channels led to the grandparents finding out, so won't those same channels tell the kid when they're older about this lost family they have? What happens when the kid is older and wants a relationship with their paternal family? Will you prevent it then? What happens if the kid resents you for keeping this whole family away (especially considering the complex issue of the father)? \n\nI just don't feel like you thought this through very well. \"Ignore it because baby daddy said it was okay.\" is only really a functional strategy while the kid is too young to have agency.", "NTA\n\nSperm donors' parents aren't grandparents.\n\nYou have no obligation to include them if you don't want. Especially given their distance, that they don't travel themselves and from what you said, their opinions will be more involved than you intended.\n\nDon't listen to the Y T A s due to people assuming big families are always better. Not the case.", "NTA", "YTA for just ignoring them. Be an adult and tell them that you\u2019re not interested", "NTA\n\nBut can I just ask why don't you want extended family, cousins, a support system for you?\n\nyou are 23 and want a in your words \"big family\" but what on your own terms, because families big or small bring drama and baggage and everything else in between.\n\nand what if this mate of yours changes his mind and wants to be the full-time dad and co raise, it's his baby too, and he does have rights...unless he's signed them away.\n\nyou don't want your baby to have grandparents, cousins, and everything else. now it's your decision to make but the reality is, your baby may grow up and resent you for the decision. that is something you have to consider \n\nyou seem to have laid plans to shut everyone out of this narrative, and have a big family but willingly cut off any support system.\n\nbut anyway, congrats on the baby", "If you had this agreement with the sperm donor that he was not to be involved in the baby's life, why on earth did he tell his family?  This is a pretty big, foundational thing to agree on, so why was that either not decided on beforehand, or dealt with by the sperm donor after-the-fact if somehow forgotten?\n\nI think it is human nature for a lot of people *(whether they are children or adults)* to compare themselves against what is seen as normal or traditional, so depending on the personality of your child, and how supportive and fulfilling the homelife you provide for him/her is, your child may or may not be resentful of not having a father-figure in his/her life.  You can never predict.  Some only children lament being the only child and blame their parents for an upbringing free of a sibling.  Some only children did not mind it.  \n\nHaving a large family, working full-time and having 4 dogs is a lot, even for a two people, let alone one.  Make sure that you have an adequate support system and that you do not let stress, both emotionally and financially, impact the type of environment you provide for this child.", "NTA - this was your choice by design. If you\u2019re happy doing this on your own, set your boundaries and don\u2019t break them for others. Sounds like you know what you want and planned accordingly.", "NTA This is the arrangement you and the sperm donor consented to. It's nobody else's business.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re the mother and even the father agrees with you. It\u2018s not your parent\u2018s business and they\u2018re the AHs for judging you for setting boundaries.", "NTA. I think you just need to be prepared 1 day that the child might resent you for not trying to have a relationship with them and may try to reach out to them.", "I'm not going to judge you here, because I totally get both sides of the argument going on, but just going to say you need to be really sure that everything is going to turn out right. What contingencies have you made in case your friend suddenly decides that he wants to be involved with (at the end of the day) his child's life? I assume that something is going to have to be done to prevent that from happening, and also so he doesn't get lumbered with child support bills if he keeps to the agreement, because he was essentially just planning on being a sperm donor.", "NTA.  You made an agreement that's working for you.  Be sure to have legal docs drawn up for bio dad to relinquish all parental rights.  Best of luck.", "Question? How did they found out if your baby dad is LC with them.. did you and him had an agreement that he was only a sperm donor? \nIf so I would block them and keep it moving.. if your baby dad is LC is with good reason.. even if they threaten grandparents right as long as your baby dad doesn\u2019t sign the birth certificate and depending on your state I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t do much.", " NTA \nI get them wanting to be involved and it\u2019s a little sad for them. But it\u2019s your choice and you should do what suits your lifestyle. \nWould be different if the dad were involved (going to be involved) and it was him facilitating the relationship between child and paternal grandparents, but since he\u2019s little to no involvement it would just be an unwanted strain on you while the child is young.", "NTA \n\nIt's your child and the family of the dad has no right to be included if you don't want that. Do you involve the Dad in the parenting?", "I\u2019m going with a slight but kind YTA,  just because in this day and age\u2014and especially in the future\u2014your child will likely be able to find out their paternity and may take great offense with you making this decision to isolate them from potential family that wanted to be a part of their life.  They probably will not think like you and may want all the aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents they can get. Because although we can all say it like you did, you in fact did not use a sperm donor, you know who this child\u2019s father and paternal family are and are actively choosing to conceal them, that could lead to this kid never talking to you again one day. My suggestion is to meet with a child therapist and find out the best way to navigate all this and how to be honest with your child about their parentage.", "NTA. You're going to make mistakes as a parent. Resign yourself to this fact. This very well may be one of them, and your kid may resent you for it, but it's your right as a parent to make mistakes. If, when the kid is older, he/she shows curiosity about the other side of the family, then revisit the topic and consider letting them meet. Till then, do your thing momma.", "Agreed on NTA- however, if there is no good reason for them not to \"be involved\", I wouldn't go out of my way to prevent them. You could still stay low-effort on your part... send pictures and invite them to the birthday parties. If they don't want to travel or put in effort, that's on them. They don't have to be a part of raising the kid, but it would be 2 more people that would love your baby, and there isn't any harm in keeping that relationship available. You can always cut it off if they become overbearing.\n\nTotally your choice though.", "NTA - yet be prepared that they may pursue having a relationship with the baby no matter what the sperm donor says.  At least in the US, grandparents have gone to court to get visitation etc.  \n\nHopefully this situation won't smack you with the hard to learn \"never say never\".  This is going to be a very fluid situation for a very long time. You may feel differently about things at different stages, the donor could also do the same.  Then add the child itself into the mix about having feelings about wanting to know a father, his family, etc.  You may feel you have full control of the narrative - but ultimately you may not and should be prepared for that.", "NTA As a parent it is up to you to choose who is involved with your child. Some states in the U.S. recognize grandparents' rights (not sure this is the case where you are from), but I wouldn't worry about that unless it becomes an issue. Your parents may be right about your child resenting you for denying them a relationship with their extended family, but there is no way to know for sure.", "NTA You\u2019re having a baby with a sperm donor. Sperm donor\u2019s families are not involved in the life of the baby.", "Hmm.. Tough. Is babys dad planning on being involved? If so... then yes YTA for closing out his family. If baby dad is not planning on being around then and involved then NTA and why did he even tell his family about the situation?", "YTA. Selfish. Not because of the grandparents, but because of the baby.", "Not sure where you live, but in much of the world, the father has an absolute right to see and be involved with his child.", "YTA - Unless these people are dangerous, to what benefit is it to your child to limit the love and support they have in their life? Why don\u2019t you want your child to have an extended family? Why do you think it\u2019s in the best interest of your baby for them to be practically alone in this world? What if something happens to you? Isn\u2019t it a good thing for them to have family and physically and probably monetary support?\n\nYou are choosing your own selfish interest over the well-being of your baby.", "wow....yta and i feel for the poor kid. so your parents are involved in your and the baby to be's life but the babies fathers family can't be. Wow.", "Info: What do you mean by ignored them? You didn't even respond? Do you have good reasons to not want them in your baby's life?", "Info, did you have a relationship with this man just to get pregnant and did he know about it?", "I think YTA. you can do whatever you want 100%. but you are literally putting yourself over the kid right now. there is no good reason for a baby not to have two more grandparents spoiling it. you don't have to go over every christmas, but let the baby know it's family. If you are going to do this ask yourself if it is actually benefitting your kid in any way", "Sorry but YTA\u2026 if you truly didn\u2019t want the dad or his family involved why didn\u2019t you go the sperm bank route????", "I would say that\u2019s being selfish although I get it. Maybe as time goes on you will be more comfortable.", "YTA\n\nA baby isn't a pet or a possession. The father's parents are this child's grandparents and unless they are abusive in some way (being \"old fashioned\" isn't abusive) it is cruel to both the child and the grandparents to keep that baby away. \n\nIt also concerns me that you seem to see having a baby as something to be checked off your list and to own. Your about to have a rude awakening on just how demanding being a parent is.", "YTA for deliberately bringing a child into the world without a dad, or paternal family. Your parents are right.

I just don\u2019t understand why someone would choose to isolate their child and choose on their behalf to not have family.", "I\u2019m not shaming her. \nBabies are not possessions. They are people who grow and interact. They are enriched by the people in their lives who love them. \n\nShe\u2019s treating this child as a transaction that only she has a say in.  Her child will grow up to resent her for that.", "99% of single parent households aren\u2019t deliberate.  It was forced on them one way or another and I guarantee the vast majority of kids raised that way would say that given the option, they would have rather have two parents.  You\u2019re denying extra love and extra help because of your pride.", "Single parent doesn\u2019t \u201csingle family member\u201d.  People say \u201cit takes a village\u201d for a reason.", "Single parent households usually happen by \"accident\".", "My household is a single parent household. My kids have lost parents and I assure you that they\u2019d much prefer everyone to be in their lives if possible. That\u2019s not to say that kids grow up without loved ones around, but when you have to build your village from scratch, it\u2019s different than when you have relatives readily available. \n\nYou need to consider your kid in this. Not just you. Comparing yourself to single family households that haven been torn apart for different reasons isn\u2019t the same. You\u2019re asking if you\u2019re the asshole for not even considering it, and yes. You are.", ">Being raised by one parent isn\u2019t the end of the world. My goodness.\n\nIt isn't the end of the world but statistics show it makes life worse in about every aspect of it. It's one thing when it happens accidentally but it's another to do it willingly.", "Agreed. Just get a consult, be sure you\u2019re all protected for ALL of your sakes. Then, it is up to you. NTA.", "You did mess up.. should have had a lawyer involved from the start. Go lawyer up now... might save you a lot of headache.", "Yah the thing is without a legal document he can change his mind. My dear you should have gotten a lawyer. Also if your in the USA some states have grandparents rights. You should consult with a lawyer ASAP", "Bc sometimes you need to talk about it w someone maybe he thought he could trust. Actual legal donors talk about it all the time", "she told the friend. she said that in another comment, mutual friend then told his parents.", "They are. OP was transparent with the donor when trying to conceive, and he was transparent with her that he didn't want any involvement.\n\nJust because the donor made a direct deposit doesn't mean the intent was any different than going through a bank.", "Read OP's comments, this is more or less a \"donor child\", only with a known donor. I truly believe the kid will have an easier time accepting they were a result of mom's choice to have a family, instead of knowing there's a bio dad out there who doesn't want contact...", "The guy is already low contact with his parents for being controlling and overbearing. Why would she want that round her kid?", "They don\u2019t suck; they\u2019re just overbearing and critical, not necessarily bad people just old fashioned.", "Sure. OP stated sperm donor\u2019s family tends to be a little overbearing and critical. If OP is the one carrying the child, putting a roof over it\u2019s head, caring for it on a daily basis, they\u2019re under no obligation to put themselves in the position of tolerating extended family. Especially if all they were looking for is a sperm donor, and the sperm donor is in total agreement with what OP wants. The only opinions that matter here is OP and the individual who helped create the fetus. I totally see your perspective but OP owes nothing to extended family whatsoever. If the baby grows up to be a young adult and wants to meet the family of their own free will, that\u2019s a different story.\n\nAlso, we don\u2019t know how donor\u2019s family is. Sometimes you\u2019d rather have no family than a family that can make things worse.", "Are you psychic? Do you know OP personally? No. You don't. Babies are people that are brought into this world my women who want them. As long as she's fit to be a mother there's no problem. She will probably raise her baby to be more respectful than you \ud83d\ude44", "Where does it say that OP doesn\u2019t have family and friends?", "Even the father of the child doesn\u2019t associate with his own family. Not every family is created equal / worth keeping in ones life. OP mentions her parents so clearly she also has a family of her own and she likely has friends as well.", "Statistics also show that children raised in happy single parent homes do better than those raised in unhappy two parent homes. The ideal is a happy home with two loving parents, but forcing a two parent home \u201cfor the kids\u201d is actually a terrible idea if the parents don\u2019t actually have a healthy relationship.", "In that case, why not let the child have all his family involved? I hated my son\u2019s father\u2019s family. I hate them. They are awful people. But I never kept them away. They were his family and he wasn\u2019t in harm. Kids benefit from all the love, the culture and stories of family. Just seems unnecessary and complicated to involve anyone if you don\u2019t want them to know. I can\u2019t judge on this. I just hope the child can have all his family.", "i don't think you are TA for not wanting to play family with some people I assume you've never even met. But -maybe- full non contact isn't the best choice. The whole way you are going about this is really cool, I am excited for you and congratulations!", "One day your baby will be an adult. He or she may have a child they don't really want and agree to give away.\n\nIf you find out about this grandchild would you like to be in your grandchild's life? If so then you have the answer. \n\nLet your baby's grandparents get to know them. There is facetime and sending gifts at holidays and Christmas and when your baby is a little older a week at grandma and grandpa's in the summer.\n\nYou don't have to drive nine hours every week. But life is hard right? Don't take away people who will love your baby from them. \n\nIt isn't right and what goes around comes around. You wouldn't like it is it happened to you. Don't do this to the grandparents or your baby.", "Yes indeed, but there it's not this situation. She willingly decided to bring this child in a one parent household. She didn't break up with the father because it was going to make an unhappy family.", "If they have an agreement it\u2019s only up to them and no one else. My cousin gave a child up for adoption the whole family wanted to be a part of its life but it wasn\u2019t up to the family. It was up to her", "It doesn\u2019t really matter either way. You could go into a happy partnership with someone you trust, have a child, and they could end up cheating on you or doing any number of things that could end up causing discord in your relationship. There is no way to guarantee that your partnership will remain a happy one. \n\nWhether raising a child on your own or in a relationship, there are truly no guarantees.", ">Whether raising a child on your or in a relationship, there are truly no guarantees.\n\nThere is a guarantee when you purposely have a child alone though. That's the issue.", "No, it is absolutely *not* a guarantee. Studies don\u2019t show that all children raised by single mothers are guaranteed to have shitty lives."]}
