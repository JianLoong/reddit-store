That said, not knowing your sister at all, perhaps a little grace towards her would be good. She\u2019s definitely struggling. She made a bad choice in getting and staying pregnant with a dead beat. And now, if she has any sense of responsibility, she is facing the end of the free stage of her life. Not saying she gets a pass for that-she should take full accountability. \n\nI\u2019m just saying that putting myself in her shoes: in addition to all the expected challenges of growing a future person she has a life that sounds chaotic and unpredictable.

She will likely never admit it but I have no doubt that she did it on purpose just to have something to emotionally blackmail you with for the rest of your life. She\u2019s using your desire for children to emotionally blackmail you into doing whatever she wants and the baby isn\u2019t even here yet.\n\nIt\u2019s never going to stop either. She\u2019s going to use the baby to make you serve her hand and foot. She\u2019s already trying to separate you from your husband (for a BS reason) and keep you isolated with just her and the baby.

But you leave her no choice, if she wants to fight her \"village\" when she's about to give birth. That's her decision.\n\nEdit: holding the 'you can't have kids' above your head, is the absolute lowest.

For the emotional and mental well being of you and your husband you need to set strong boundaries with these people.  If they can't respect your boundaries and continue to try and manipulate and use you, then you cut them out of your life until they can learn to respect you.\n\nI'm sorry to hear you are experiencing fertility issues, that is a very difficult thing to deal with.  Your sister using that as a way to attack and control you is terrible.  Adoption could be a good thing for your husband and you to look into.
