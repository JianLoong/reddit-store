I just think that the chances of finding work after graduating is not the only thing to consider when you pick a university like Cambridge... maybe I'm wrong, tho", "Sorry I didn\u2019t have the same experience as you. This was mine in the UK right as brexit happened. Things were as mess.", "Take it from someone who went to another best UK university. That\u2019s just how it works. There\u2019s plenty of US jobs too that won\u2019t take foreigners due to visas no matter the program. It\u2019s more than just the degree. As I said it\u2019s not impossible but it could be difficult."]}
