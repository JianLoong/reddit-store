She ended up not going and deferred her admission to see if this year she can get a loan (which I'm not for, but it is her life) or if she can get a scholarship for a better American college.\n\nShe seems a little annoyed at me since effectively her brother got more money but that was before I knew better. I can afford the same for her but it would be tighter now and I don't want the same thing to happen especially if it would be for a foreign degree. I suspect the same could happen to her since her brother was typically the brighter one while she just pushed herself the last years of school.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEDIT: genuinely thanks for calling me out and making me do more research on Cambridge, I think I understand better now.

Having students enter undeclared, change their major or add a second major/minor are all great ways to ensure you need to pay for more than just 8 semesters. Requiring students to apply directly to programs is actually one of the handful of things that I think needs restructured in any federal attempt to reduce student loan debt.", "Okay let me explain to folks abroad, the US university system is for profit. You pay by credit hours. You have to have certain amount of credit hours to get a degree up to bachelor degree, the higher and PHD degrees have different criteria.\n\nUp to a bachelor degree you have some credit hours that are courses that are degree specific. and a lot of other credit classes that are prerequisite and elective. While you are taking the prerequisite and electives which can take a year or 2, those credits are transferable to another degree. So any time in those first few years it is possible to change you major.\n\nIts one of the reasons why higher education in the US is so ridiculously expensive. They pad the requirements for getting a degree with a lot of useless, unnecessary classes to increase the billable credit hours.", "It depends.

Because chances are you are taking general education classes that can be transferred to any other degree.

That's part of growing up, learning and life. There are a million reasons that someone might not achieve their original academic goals. There's also a million reasons that they may change their majors. The fact you state that the major he changed to is \"less lucrative\" leads me to believe that your main measure of importance for your children's education (and potentially other areas of their lives) are how prestigious and financially profitable their interests are.  \nDoes your son even *like* computer science anymore? Does it make him happy? Is he passionate about it? Maybe he got into the classes and found that it doesn't bring him any fulfilment. Maybe he found a new direction that fills him with excitement and joy. Maybe he found a path in a different direction that made him feel alive, sparked his curiousity, his hunger for learning, and that he could see himself succeeding in.  \nDoes that matter to you? Do you care more about whether your son is happy and fulfilled, or if he's making more money in a job that looks more prestigious?  \n\n> He went out of state and I now realize that this was a poor investment.\n\nYour son is growing up and discovering who he is, what he wants in his life, and what he wants for his future and career. Failure and changes in direction are part of that, not the ending of that. You're investing in your son becoming his own adult self. Not your son becoming a computer scientist. If investing in your son exploring who he is means he fails, but doesn't give up, makes you feel like it's a \"poor investment\", then I'd seriously recommend you to have a good look at yourself and how you view your children. You don't own their futures just because you are financially contributing to them. They don't have to fulfil your expectations just because you think that is what is best. The disappointment you feel is yours alone- you had expectations that you held about them, and when your son didn't adhere to them (because he is not you, he is an individual human being), you feel like he has let you down. That's your problem. Not his.  \n\nYTA also when it comes to your daughter.  \nYou're now punishing her for the \"failure\" (again, a failure by a metric *you* established in your own mind) of her brother. Before she even had the chance to try.  \n\n>She ended up not going and deferred her admission to see if this year she can get a loan (which I'm not for, but it is her life) or if she can get a scholarship for a better American college.\n\nYou don't get to deny financial support for her and then be upset and disapprove of her seeking a loan. My brother in Christ what is she meant to do? You set her up to \"fail\" your own metric again. \"I won't help you but if you get a loan, I will not approve of that either\". Damned if she do, damned if she don't.  \n\n>She seems a little annoyed at me since effectively her brother got more money but that was before I knew better.\n\nI would be too. She's probably wondering why you are treating her differently. She's probably now racking her brain for every time you might have treated her differently to her brother before now, too. Wondering what she did wrong, was she not good enough, did she push too hard, was she too much, not enough, didn't try hard enough, maybe if she was your son and not your daughter, maybe if she was closer to you, all the \"what's wrong with me?\" scenarios and questions would be going through her head right now. Except none of it is her fault- it's you. You have punished her for your own ideas of failure, based on your son's path and decisions. She had nothing to do with this.  \n\n>I can afford the same for her but it would be tighter now and I don't want the same thing to happen especially if it would be for a foreign degree\n\nYou're really hung up on \"foreign\" degrees and universities. They're not haphazard classrooms with dodgy standards and meaningless qualifications at the end. Some may be transferrable to your home state/country, some may not. But that's for your son and daughter to figure out.  \n\n>I suspect the same could happen to her since her brother was typically the brighter one while she just pushed herself the last years of school.\n\nDamn I would be absolutely crushed if I was your daughter and found out my dad saw me this way. Your daughter worked her ass off and now your think it's likely she'll fail because she's \"less bright\" than her brother, who failed (again, by your metric)? Jesus.  \n\nSo what's really underneath all this? Are you afraid that your children are growing up and making their own decisions, and becoming truly independent and moving away from the idea you had of who they were and what they want? Are you feeling it for the first time because they are likely to be moving away, and now potentially overseas? Are you worried that your children will make you look like a failure of a parent if they're not high level computer scientists? Are you worried that you will spend your money and your children won't get a degree, and that you will feel robbed?  \nWhat do you *want*? Do you want children who will pursue their dreams, even if it means changing their minds? Or do you want children who will stick something out, even if it means they're miserable, not able to achieve the scores they need, and struggling the whole time? Do you want children who will do what they're told, even if it's not what they want or what is right for them?  \nOr do you want children who will be able to say \"No, this is what is right for me, and I'll be doing this, even if others don't agree\"?  \n\nBecause the way you're viewing your children, and judging their decisions, values and abilities, is a path that is likely to quickly lead to them resenting you. You're building a nice big gun that will be shooting you in the foot somewhere down the line. And your children are going to expect you to expect them to be disappointments, failures and to never be able to measure up to your idea of success; they will be able to tell that you don't care about their happiness or what they want. And that will fracture their self worth, and in turn, their relationship with you in a way that will take monumental effort to repair.  \nPlease go to therapy. You will be able to get guidance and support from a professional who will help you tease out some of the underlying reasons why you hold these views and values that you project onto your kids.  \n\nThey don't deserve to feel like your love and support is conditional. And if you don't figure out how to love them unconditionally and how to *show* them that, you will lose them.", "Oh my God, you're Such an AH.\n\n>, I thought college would open up opportunities and he was supposed to major in computer science but failed a bunch of classes and changed his major to something less lucrative.
