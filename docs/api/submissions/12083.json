This woman and I have been friends for years, but she doesn't teach her kids any manners at the dinner table.

Mostly they run around the house with food and get it everywhere. One time I was sitting in the living room and the older girl was eating an ice cream cone and whirling around in circles and it was flying EVERYWHERE. I tried to be tolerant when they were little, but they are now both in the double digits.   She has started asking why I'm turning down dinner invitations at her house, or not inviting her family over to mine, or going out to eat together like we used to. I told her that the way her kids eat and handle food really puts me off my own appetite, and I'd prefer to visit her when there is NOT food involved.

She pressed you for an answer and you gave it. You're under no obligation to put up with her undisciplined kids.", "NTA. Her kids are, in fact, gross. And your friend is gross for tolerating that behavior. Food messes stop being cute when the kid outgrows a highchair.", "NTA they are too old to be behaving that way, clearly shows a lack of parenting and discipline on her part. I feel bad for those kids because double digits means they\u2019ve already been cementing these bad habits for years", "NTA - she is going to limit her children's future in immeasurable ways if she doesn't at least ATTEMPT to remind them what proper food etiquette is.  This is a throwback from the 1950's that I hope we can all agree is still worth teaching kids in the 2020's.  Your protest might not make the situation much better but it might keep them from devolving even more like zoo animals.", "NTA! Manners never go out of style and should be taught.", "NTA. That IS gross and so unhygienic.", "NTA. We have a similar situation with some friends. Their kids destroy everything. They are allowed to climb on cars, crash their bikes and electric cars into vehicles etc. We only drive out beater car to their house so it's not a big deal if one of the kids runs into it with something or decides to climb on it. We try to avoid having their kids at our house often. Maybe people will learn to not let their kids act feral if they want other people to come around.", "NTA. You shared a hard truth.", "NTA! Manners maketh respected individuals!", "NTA - They are more than old enough to have decent table manners. I don't blame you for not wanting to eat with them around. Those kids are going to have a hard time when they grow up and start dating or if they have a lunch interview for a job.", "#NTA\n\nHow is she not bothered by her kids being so damn messy?", "NTA. Heck, you can put a spoon in the hand of a ONE year old so they start learning.", "NTA because your objections are perfectly reasonable and were presented politely. But there really was no way she was going to take that well. She\u2019s got to know that her kids\u2019 manners are not the norm and, for whatever reason, she\u2019s decided that that\u2019s ok.\n\nI wonder what these kids are like at school lunch and kid birthday parties or if either of them has ever had a repeat invitation to eat at a friend\u2019s house. I\u2019m surprised they got to be this old without facing social repercussions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
