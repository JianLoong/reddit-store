She pressed you for an answer and you gave it. You're under no obligation to put up with her undisciplined kids.", "NTA. Her kids are, in fact, gross. And your friend is gross for tolerating that behavior. Food messes stop being cute when the kid outgrows a highchair.", "NTA they are too old to be behaving that way, clearly shows a lack of parenting and discipline on her part. I feel bad for those kids because double digits means they\u2019ve already been cementing these bad habits for years", "NTA - she is going to limit her children's future in immeasurable ways if she doesn't at least ATTEMPT to remind them what proper food etiquette is.  This is a throwback from the 1950's that I hope we can all agree is still worth teaching kids in the 2020's.  Your protest might not make the situation much better but it might keep them from devolving even more like zoo animals.", "NTA! Manners never go out of style and should be taught.", "NTA. That IS gross and so unhygienic.", "NTA. We have a similar situation with some friends. Their kids destroy everything. They are allowed to climb on cars, crash their bikes and electric cars into vehicles etc. We only drive out beater car to their house so it's not a big deal if one of the kids runs into it with something or decides to climb on it. We try to avoid having their kids at our house often. Maybe people will learn to not let their kids act feral if they want other people to come around.", "NTA. You shared a hard truth.", "NTA! Manners maketh respected individuals!", "NTA - They are more than old enough to have decent table manners. I don't blame you for not wanting to eat with them around. Those kids are going to have a hard time when they grow up and start dating or if they have a lunch interview for a job.", "#NTA\n\nHow is she not bothered by her kids being so damn messy?", "NTA. Heck, you can put a spoon in the hand of a ONE year old so they start learning.", "NTA because your objections are perfectly reasonable and were presented politely. But there really was no way she was going to take that well. She\u2019s got to know that her kids\u2019 manners are not the norm and, for whatever reason, she\u2019s decided that that\u2019s ok.\n\nI wonder what these kids are like at school lunch and kid birthday parties or if either of them has ever had a repeat invitation to eat at a friend\u2019s house. I\u2019m surprised they got to be this old without facing social repercussions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not your fault she doesn't like the truth.", "Nta. Tell to teach them manners.", "NTA.  Kids need to understand at least basic table manners.  Just like they need to learn how to clean up, do laundry, take care of their hygiene, etc.  They need to learn these life skills from their parents.  Your friend is probably embarrassed because you called out her lazy parenting.  But someone needed to.", "NTA. \nIf anything, you were too nice.", "NTA\n\nManners matter. Your friend didn't teach her kids any. This is a sad situation because you aren't going to be the only person who has an issue with this. They'll have to learn what they should have been taught young as adults. Never a good thing.", "From your description of these children's behavior, I just bet you're not the only one who avoids your friend because of them.

Agree, OP NTA", "She said both were in the double-digits, so at least 10 years old.", "She said both double digits.", "yes, one is 10 and the other is 12.", "NTA. She asked and you were honest. I would have done the same in your shoes. Unless their are underlying mental development issues there are no excuses for that behavior. Well other than a lazy parent.", "NTA\n\nWhile reading, I thought they're like 5, and she should at least start teaching them, before they start school and so on. But, they're (almost?) teenagers?? \n\nShe *really* needs a wake-up call. Damn, aren't they already relentlessly bullied at school? If not, it's going to start at some moment for sure.\n\nAlso, I have so much respect for putting up with that *in your own home* for such a long time. Kudos to you, OP.", "NTA it\u2019s parents job to teach their kids", "NTA. You don't hate her kids, you hate their terrible manners. You didn't comment on it until she asked you. If she can't deal with the reality that her kids are gross and that will limit their social opportunities, that's on her.", "NTA, she should be embarrassed, not defensive.

It's better to tell your friend outright that she should be teaching her kids proper food hygiene; than for her to find out that you're avoiding her because her kids are gross.", "NTA, tell her you don't hate her kids just her parenting (or lack thereof) and watch her go nuclear.", "I have three kids of my own and even my youngest one doesn't act like that.

Next time get a trough and feed them from that and see how it goes over", "Nta.  Maybe fix the title bc it makes you sound bad.  However, you don't have to go anywhere.  Also I wouldn't go to a house like that either", "If a kid did that crap at my house I would have told them to stop, so what if their parents are there, my house, my rules.  I\u2019ve had friends over with children when my son was little, if they were not behaving properly, I told them the expectation at my house.  I wouldn\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s house where their children behaves like that  either but I would have said something long ago.", "Pretty much all kids are gross, the parents of the kids have just built up an immunity to the grossness.", "and use utensils", "NTA and honestly you hopefully will get her to teach them. When I was 11, I made a \"friend\" from church because our moms wanted to exchange carpooling days. One day I found her in my kitchen eating peanut butter out of the jar with her fingers. Licking, digging, licking. Girl never asked for a knife. I threw up on my own chin. Begged my mom to never make me hang out with her again. \n\nThose kids are going to wind up embarrassing themselves if someone doesn't teach them.", "NTA. I thought at the beginning of your story the kids must be about kindergarten age - but double digits is way too old to behave like that. I had a co-worker who would let her barely one-year-old run around while eating (sitting at the table is so restrictive!) and she'd smear mashed veggies on everything - at home, or out and about. Absolutely mental.", "NTA I don\u2019t like her kids either. Feel free to tell her that.", "Nta. She should teach her kids to act their age.", "As a parent of a 1yo, can confirm this is true.", "All kids r gross tbh, I hate kids too but I would be cautious around their parents tho. Ik their gross and ur NTA but yep", "NTA but she and her husband are.  No one will want these kids at their house.  They will have a difficult time maintaining friends.  Their parents have done a huge disservice by not teaching them basic hygiene, etiquette and using silverware, eww!", "Oh, double digits, NTA. They should know better. The ice cream giving me Kathryn Hahn from Parks and Rec 'PANCHO.' vibes.", "NTA, It sounds like those kids are practically feral", "I bet thier house is nasty. If they were the kind of people that kept it clean, they'd have taught them better so they wouldn't have to constantly be picking up messes and wiping things.", "I'll give a parent a chance to parent their child in my house. But if not I will. My house my rules, this is one situation where that saying totally applies. I'd the parent is unhappy and take me about it I'll make sure they know how unhappy I am with them. Idgaf.", "yes but when these kids are in the double digits they need to stop thay behavior", "This is true but parents should also be at least trying to teach their children to be less gross. My 6 year old likes to be up and moving all the time but she isn\u2019t allowed to be when she\u2019s eating and she knows why. We began explaining to her as soon as she was old enough about cleanliness especially with food because if you have food bits all around your house it will attract hugs and rodents. We\u2019ve also explained that it\u2019s unsafe to be moving around so much and eating as it can lead to choking. Kids aren\u2019t stupid and they can learn, parents are supposed to teach them the basics at the very least. \n\nNTA. Her kids are gross because she\u2019s not teaching them not to be. She\u2019s setting them up for a hard time later in life and driving her friends away. Someone needed to tell her.", "No that's not true. Can people stop with these anti children statements. You might not like kids but that doesn't equate to them being gross or less meaningful. Parents stop being pushovers. Adults and kids alike can all be little shits and gross. Age is not a determinant."]}
