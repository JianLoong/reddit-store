I thought at the beginning of your story the kids must be about kindergarten age - but double digits is way too old to behave like that.

My 6 year old likes to be up and moving all the time but she isn\u2019t allowed to be when she\u2019s eating and she knows why. We began explaining to her as soon as she was old enough about cleanliness especially with food because if you have food bits all around your house it will attract bugs and rodents. We\u2019ve also explained that it\u2019s unsafe to be moving around so much and eating as it can lead to choking. Kids aren\u2019t stupid and they can learn, parents are supposed to teach them the basics at the very least. \n\nNTA. Her kids are gross because she\u2019s not teaching them not to be.

Can people stop with these anti children statements. You might not like kids but that doesn't equate to them being gross or less meaningful. Parents stop being pushovers. Adults and kids alike can all be little shits and gross. Age is not a determinant.", "Nope, you sure aren\u2019t! I\u2019m a mom of 3 boys and they know how to eat and behave themselves. I taught them there are times to goof off and times to be serious and there\u2019s no fun in making messes with food in a home unless it\u2019s a food fight outside where everyone who is involved is ok with it.

Seriously wonder how kids like function in society, for example, at school, eating lunch.", "Even if they were slightly younger I'd still be grossed out and would refuse to be with them in any event involving food. little kids can learn manners. this is bad parenting and a big disservice to her children. I wonder if they know and follow basic hygiene.", "NTA. My 2.5 year old knows not to do any of those things. She struggles with remembering where to put half eaten food, and sometimes it does end up on my plate or back on the serving dish. But more than 50% of the time, she'll put it in the trash can or on the kitchen counter. \n\nYour friend is doing her children a huge disservice by not teaching them appropriate table manners. If they're in double digit ages, they're going to start facing some serious social consequences for this. No one is going to want to eat lunch with them at school.

The way you described them I thought they would be like.... 4?", "They're 'double digits'!  So at least 10 and above for the two kids.\n\nThis behavior should have been nipped in the bud when they're toddlers, as you pointed out.  I'm trying to wrap my head around a 10 or 12 year old eating mashed potatoes with their hands.", "Actually her friend is the most wrong, it a parent's job to parent their kids. These kids are so big and not learning means their parents are gross themselves and haven't taught their kids anything.", "Yes! I don't care if they don't which fork to use, but at least they should know that they should be using a fork.", "From your description of these children's behavior,", "If the parent was aware of my rules then I would too but if not I\u2019d step in.  I\u2019m not talking about being nasty of course more like \u201chey bud in our house we sit at the table to eat.  I\u2019ll take that and if you want to eat it will be on the table\u201d.", "We have started teaching our 2 year old how to eat correctly. Now obviously, he's 2 and still makes messes, but he tries to help clean them up when he spills, or at least notifies someone that there's a mess. We take him out to eat (at family friendly restaurants), and for the most part he does well. He may stand on his chair and do a happy dance when the food gets there, but he doesn't run around and bother other tables. If we can get that much out of a toddler, there's really no excuse for kids in double digit ages to not know how to eat neatly.", "\"Hate the kids\" she's so dramatic. \n\nPeople really aren't teaching their kids basics anymore? \n\nAt least you said something, now she knows her kids behavior needs to be changed.", "NTA at double digit ages they should have way more table manners than that.

I worked with a woman who would bring dishes to company potlucks. We all stopped eating her food after she giggled and told us that her kids were SO CUTE because they helped her prepare the food while they were home WITH THE FLU.

I never turn down cake, but I have limits of how much bodily fluid I want to ingest. \n\nShe got rather angry that everyone started avoiding her dishes and we finally had to tell her that her food hygiene was awful, particularly with her kids.

I was always getting in trouble for snagging things from the salad bowl with my hands, even if I was careful to only touch the thing I was picking up. It didn't really make sense to me I think that it's ok to pick up a carrot stick from a plate with your hands or a couple nuts from a bowl of nuts but not pick up one thing from a salad  bowl. What's the difference?\n\nAnyways, that *is* disgusting and likely to spread all sorts of cold germs and whatnot. Also leaving bits of food throughout the house can attract pests.

I served lunch during the visit, and her daughter went around grabbing food off of plates. I was so grossed out and upset that one of the other attendants took me aside to see what was wrong.

No nastiness. Just the same way I'd direct my own child. It's not the kids fault.
