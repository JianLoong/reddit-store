Yes, you made clear you didn't want a child, but now that child is here.

That you financially support the child is also good, though the bare minimum tbh. However, you go into YTA territory by seemingly not even trying to better yourself - the kid's here now, whether you like it or not.

While neither choice is *optimal* when it comes to raising a child, one is clearly better than the other if you know you don't want to or cannot be there for the child.", "As I've said to many other comments, there are several financial/medical reasons why he may not have had a vasectomy at the time.", "No one said they are. He has obviously put a lot more thought into the situation than simply throw money at the problem and make it go away.", "Since when is there a problem for men to get a vasectomie?", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve met the United States, but currently abstinence is the only way women can be confident of not being forced into motherhood. It shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 but expecting men who don\u2019t want kids to take responsibility shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask, either.", "No the government already  says that without our help lol", "I hate to break it to you, but there is literally an entire, powerful political moment predicated on the idea that women who don\u2019t want kids shouldn\u2019t have sex.", "This. I understand why so many people think child-free people should just get sterilized to avoid having kids but most do not understand how hard that actually is. Many health care professionals will flat out refuse if you are in your 20s and don't have kids because you may change your mind or your future partners may want kids. It's an issue for men and women. My friend got his vasectomy this year and because he's mid 20s and no kids he had to fight like hell for 2 years. There is also a time period after the procedure where you can't work and thats not feasible for everyone. If child-free people had the option to just get sterilized to avoid these situations, most of them would do it.", "It would be worse if OP was a woman.", "Lmao", "> I have a feeling a lot of the same people bitching about him abandoning the child are the same people who would like to limit access to adequate birth control and abortions in favor of everyone having a \"nuclear family,\" even those who don't want one.\n\n\"Anybody who thinks men should take responsibility is also a republican.\" You're a moron.", "If he put a lot of thought into it, he would have actually tried to better himself and get over his own issues so he can own up to his real duties.", "He is taking responsibility by fulfilling his financial obligation. That's all he needs to do, IMO.", "Prove me wrong!"]}
