You sound as if you're fixated on food intake, weight, and health... and not in a good way.\n\nDid you know eating disorders aren't just someone whose balemic, anorexi, or who suffer from binge eating disorder. There is also Orthorexia Nervosa (aka just Orthorexia) which is an unhealthy obsession on eating a healthy or balanced diet which often leads to overly restrictive approache, which can lead to malnutrition.\n\nI am not saying you suffer from it but it sounds very similar. Forcing your child into a diet as a punishment for an event, and not something he is doing of his own accord, is basically fat/diet shaming him. Infact, his habit of sneaking to find more food might be an indicator you are not giving him enough caloric intake based on his youth and size. Diets only work if someone willingly enters into it. Using food as a weapon of punishment is an a hole move in my opinion.\n\nEdit: fixed malnutrition", "YTA - is this post for real?  Cause if it is, this is like a play by play of how you gave your son an eating disorder.", "YTA\n\nONE processed sugar food *a month*?! When you overly restrict, you're not teaching them how to self-regulate. This is clearly the case as he ate a heroic amount of doughnuts. You're not teaching moderation, just heavy restriction. \n\nHonestly- the above is truly your call.\n\nStill- That child is, as you admit, already skinny. He ate a bunch of doughnuts because he gets 12 'processed sugar foods' a year. What kind of diet could you possibly put him on??? It's obviously not cutting back on the sweets he already doesn't get, so are you just starving him for a week, or what?", "YTA. This is how you give your kid an eating disorder. Please stop.", "Yta. Does your son understand why eating all the processed food and sugar is bad or does he just think you\u2019re trying to keep him from getting fat? Have you taught him about moderation and healthy lifestyle versus just limiting what he eats? \n\n\u201cDieting\u201d at 14 can be bad and can create an unhealthy relationship with food. Instilling healthy eating habits and showing him how to make smart decisions with food is better.", "YTA, you should never restrict or use food as punishment for a child \nnothing about that sends a message of healthy relationship with food to the child. no wonder he ate 24 donuts if this was his only opportunity to have them haha", "YTA. You\u2019re literally punishing your child by restricting food. That is a perfect recipe for an eating disorder , if he doesn\u2019t have one already. If your concern is truly keeping him healthy in the long run, this would have been a perfect time to ask him how he felt physically after he ate all those donuts and help him associate with how he feels after eating donuts vs fruit so he can develop an informed and healthy relationship with food. Otherwise, once he\u2019s out of your house, he\u2019s going to eat all the things you never let him have. And guess what? Now he has an unhealthy relationship with food and you\u2019re not around to enforce his eating habits.", "He's not fat. He isn't diabetic. He has no health issues. YTA.", "Dieting at 14 is a bad call. Don\u2019t use the term diet as it will make them anxious about food, and start an unhealthy relationship with food", "YTA. There are much more healthier ways to educate your kids about the family risk of diabetes. But what you are doing is causing a boomerang effect with your son, and creating an even more unhealthy relationship with food than diabetes poses. My grandmother was diabetic, and so far, none of her direct descendants have it, and none of us grew up with any type of sugar/dietary restrictions, unless directed by a pediatrician (a couple of my cousin\u2019s grandkids have a gluten sensitivity, so they do follow a more strict diet,  it that\u2019s it.)", "YTA. A 14yo should know better than stealing. However, I am letting him off the hook here because you have put these foods on such a pedestal that he couldn't help himself. It was like he had seen a golden egg, something so coveted he had to risk it. This is the problem with severely limiting certain foods. It can cause binge eating when they are able to get their hands on it.", "Hard YTA\nTeach him about balance and moderation and stop policing his food. This is super extreme.", "YTA. \n\nYeah, this isn't a sign of your kid being 'greedy' its a sign that he has disordered eating. He \"couldn't resist\" and stole from a care package, then ate an *obscene* amount of donuts. That is a textbook food binge. And the worst thing you can do after a binge is diet - a binge is a high, and a diet is a low, which makes the binge you just did seem even better than it was - and so the next time you have 24 donuts, all you can remember was how good it felt. \n\nSeriously, your kids are in serious danger of eating disorders. So far it sounds like they have Zero skills to regulate how much sugar they eat, because you've been doing it for them. And since diabetes runs in your family, odds are, *so does disordered eating*. Your kids are gonna move out one day, and have unfettered access to sugary foods, and they need to be able to eat 2 donuts, not 24.", "YTA. Diabetes runs in my family as well. When I was a teenager, I ate 2 packages of pop tarts without telling my mother. She found out later, told me that's why I'm fat, and made me bike 5 miles on their stationary bike in front of my whole family. She severely restricted my diet after that point and made me write down what I ate and submit it to her at the end of the day. Submitting my daily intake to her lasted about a month, but to this day I cannot eat pop tarts without feeling nauseous and I still keep a mental tally of what I've eaten. And guess what? None of that stopped me from being overweight and it actually made me struggle with binge eating disorder and severe restrictions later in life.\n\nYou say it's not a weight thing, but you told your son it's a weight thing when you pointed at his gut. Think about why he even wanted to steal snacks in the first place. Penalizing food intake at such a young age is never going to give your kids a healthy relationship with food. You are setting him up for a very challenging future if you continue with these punishments.\n\nYou also had a golden opportunity to give him a longass lecture on the importance balanced nutrition/moderation, why he should be avoiding diabetes, and to help him understand why it was wrong to eat donuts that don't belong to him. A good punishment would've been something like making him volunteer at the food bank or some other community service.", "YTA and lucky if your kid doesn't end up with an eating disorder. \n\nAnd clearly, you don't understand how diabetes works either.", "YTA, if you are putting him on a diet as a punishment. That sounds like a great way to give him an eating disorder, and make sure he sneaks foods you\u2019ve banned when he\u2019s at school or with friends.", "Yta. Forcing your kid to be on a diet is how you give them an eating disorder in adulthood. I don't know the best way you go about disciplining him because he shouldn't have done that, but forcing your already healthy weight son sounds borderline, if not outright, abusive. Also, does type 1 or 2 diabetes run in your families? Type 1 is not diet related and type 2 is a complex mix of genetics and diet. This sugar budget you have in place probably isn't doing much.", "YTA x1000 - poor kid. Have you thought about why he decided to sneak and steal?", "YTA this is how eating disorders can start and just an overall bad body image. I understand you don\u2019t want him eating sweets all day everyday but this beyond ridiculous.", "YTA. This is a recipe for an eating disorder.", "From one parent to another, I don't think a diet is the correct way to go. It might instill a bit of an unhealthy food association for him. Eating a donut is bad, now I have to diet. Boys can develop eating disorders, too, and he is at a very difficult age , which this behavior can develop very unexpectedly. I would suggest something along the lines of, you didn't ask, you know my rules about sugar, and have him do some manual labor (something that will get the calories burned off) or chores as a punishment.", "YTA. How does going on a diet saves him from the diabetes he was \u201cexposed\u201d to from the donuts? LOL. Being your child sounds very hard.", "YTA. What you are doing is abuse.", "YTA. Why do you think he did it? Perhaps because he's deprived of having sweets in moderation? Instead of not allowing any food groups, teach your children how to have a healthy relationship with food, one that includes treats in moderation. Unhealthy habits can lead to diabetes, but as you're clearly aware, genetics plays a huge role and sometimes even the healthiest people can still become diabetic.", "Stop using tough love to justify being an asshole. Forced diets don't work, shaming doesn't work. Banning him from having sweets for three days would be a reasonable punishment. Just be supportive, nurturing, and give him advice on how to take care of himself.", "YTA\n\nI understand your concern as a parent but to restrict your child's food will only lead to an eating disorder with real life consequences. I hate the word diet for a start, especially when it comes to a kid. Even if he was binge eating crap every day, you look for the cause before you start to treat the problem. The cause in this instance just sounds like a second of being a kid and seeing a bunch of donuts he could get away with eating. Your response to that wasn't reasonable in the slightest.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t think this course of action will have the results you want.", "So it\u2019s unanimous YTA\u2026 not one person who replied agreed with your tactics.  Apologize to your son and move on.  Remind him that those treats are indulgences, not a quality snack or meal and move on.", "YTA. Using a diet as punishment is a horrifically short sighted and over-reactive punishment. Food is not a punishment! It\u2019s nourishment. Also, he\u2019s a 14yo boy. His body can handle a binge every once in a while, as long as it\u2019s not common, which you said yourself he doesn\u2019t do this often!", "YTA How can he be \u201con a diet\u201d??? 1. You already have the whole family on a diet. 2. He\u2019s a thin teenager who needs to eat a lot just to grow! Honestly, limiting his food even further at this point seems abusive.\n\nAlso, 3. while your goals are laudable, you set this kid up to binge and have disordered eating by imposing such draconian rules rather than helping him develop healthy habits that will last a lifetime. You are doubling down on a failed strategy. \n\nTalk to a pediatrician, talk to a specialist in eating disorders, and get some therapy. Of course you don\u2019t want your kids to get diabetes! But you cannot strong arm them into good health either.", "YTA. The more you restrict, the more they crave. Expose em to treats while they\u2019re young and they\u2019ll develop healthy habits with snacking. Focus on portion control over restricting and it\u2019ll help way easier.", "YTA. Reducing processed sugar consumption is great, but an allowance of one processed sugary item per month is a bit extreme. Hence the extreme behaviour from your son. Also, if your son is already thin, enforcing a diet on him, might not be the healthiest thing to do. Life is all about balance.", "It's not so much a sense of entitlement as it is a teenager extremely restricted who develops an unhealthy relationship with food and is looking for opportunities to binge eat.", "YTA. Your \u201cparenting\u201d is putting your son right on track for developing an eating disorder. And it WILL be your fault.", "What else do you control and restrict for your child? I doubt controlling food is the only thing.\n\nOP, you need a therapist immediately.

Maybe look at some research at what happens to kids who's parents have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol (either way), and consider how you are doing the exact same with processed sugar.\n\nYou're not helping him develop a habit of eating healthy, but a habit of hiding food and craving the exact foods you want him to avoid", "LMAO, there's multiple people on here telling you the same thing; I'm just not softening my language b/c you're being a shit parent and you deserve to not have that sugar coated.", "Please, please, please talk to a therapist. Talk to a pediatrician. Educate yourself on the causes of eating disorders. You\u2019re so scared of one health problem you\u2019re literally causing another.", "OK you came here for answers. You got them. Listen before you screw up your kid. Jesus.", "There are multiple parents in here telling you that your child is ALREADY showing signs of disordered eating and why putting him on a diet is wrong.Why aren't you listening?", "Good parents don't restrict fruit from their children for eating too many donuts", "Dude. Pal. *Buddy.* You posted on AITH about something you are so so TA in, ask what people think, and get mad because you didn\u2019t get the answer you wanted. This is essentially an anonymous voting on whether you did the right thing or not and just about everyone here says YTA. The only thing you could do to maybe make it better is reflect on yourself and change for the better, but you are fighting everyone\u2019s collective agreement, with the idea that no one\u2019s gone outside? I genuinely think the only reason you posted this is because you wanted an excuse to sleep at night without feeling guilty about your poor life decisions.\n\nI don\u2019t think I could count the ways you have made a bad decision where there was an out to this mess. I\u2019d pop a blood vessel before I could finish. Please get help for you and your kid, preferably therapy. If you are so worried about the threat of diabetes and not control, perhaps go to your doctor and get a nutritionist or something. Your tactics don\u2019t help .", "I'm genuinely starting to question if you care about your child's health or just being right.", "You're not trying to guide him. You're trying to punish him into obedience. Of course YTA. If you want to create a situation where your son hides food and develops an eating disorder, you're on the right track. Of course, your relationship with food is already unhealthy, so the odds are against him anyway.", "You have had 14 years to guide him. He is at an age where he should be making his own food choices but you just need the control. \n\nWhat you have created is a child who is going to binge on restricted foods as much as he can because you have set up unhealthy restrictions in the home. Now he is sneaking food because of your food restrictions. \n\nInstead of teaching a healthy everything in moderation household, you set up this disordered eating and are now fat-shaming a thin child and setting him up for MORE disordered eating. \n\nYTA. You need to seek professional help for yourself.", "The direction your heading for is not health it\u2019s an eating disorder", "Speaking from experience, the moment your kids go off to college or move out they're going to go absolutely insane. I'd be surprised if they don't develop a binge eating disorder. You haven't taught them how to self regulate, and I guarantee you that your kids know that the way they eat isn't \"normal\" compared to other kids at school.", "Replying to your comment directly in the hopes that you see this. \n\nPlease don't ever use food restriction as a punishment. That was done to me as a child and it ped to an eating disorder that I'm still recovering from nearly 20 years later.", "Hey now! No sugar coating for her, she might get diabetes from it /s \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Right!  I thought she'd appreciate it, but she seemed to take offense.  Go figure ...", "Well, notice that no matter how many YTAs she gets, she still is insisting that she's right...however she's probably the cause of a lot of the diabetics in her life \ud83d\ude2c"]}
