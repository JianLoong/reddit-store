My friend agreed to watch my daughter M-W (7:30-4 at my house), & F (Noon-5pm at her home). I'd pay her $40/day (in my area, that's the daily rate for daycare per child). It's a far drive to my house (about 40 mins), so I tried to make it more worth her while. I'd pay for her gas (b/c she drove up to my house 3x a week). She'd bring her daughter, so I'd buy groceries for them for the week. We also got fun toys/playsets to make coming to our house enjoyable for her daughter. I told my friend to \"make herself at home\", which for her included taking naps when the kids did, smoke (weed) breaks, exercising & watching tv. She did her laundry at our house & my husband offered to setup an art space for her. He'd even help her if she was struggling with both kids (since he works from home).\r\n\n\r  \nRecently my friend asked if I could start bringing my kid to her apartment once we get snow. I agreed. A week later I told her my MIL could start to watch my daughter on Fridays. My friend asked \"Can you ask your MIL to watch her Tues & then bring her to me on Fridays?\" which I found frustrating. But we talked to my MIL anyways. My MIL then offered to take my daughter full time, for free. So I took her up on it. The drive to my MIL's is the same as my friends house anyways, but with less traffic. When I told my friend what we decided, she apologized for \"making things difficult\" for us & then proceeded to make her case for why she only wanted to swap days, & that she wasn't saying she didn't want to watch my kid. I told her everything is fine. Yeah, I was disappointed that she wasn't sticking to what we agreed to, but I knew I'd get over it. But she kept going & got defensive telling me the drive was putting a lot of miles on her car, she's only getting $40/day while I make way more money than she does & ending it with \"you drive down by me anyways, why can't you just bring her to my place\" so we started to argue. I tried to explain that for my MIL to legally watch my kid, she can only have a certain amount of infants in her care & that I needed to reserve as spot by a certain time. It wasn't totally about her.\r  \n\r  \nAfter our argument, I tried to let it go since I'd already agreed to having my MIL watch my kid & I didn't want to completely ruin my friendship over it. Today was the last day of my friend caring for my kid & I came home to a handwritten letter of her basically calling me out for hurting her feelings, gaslighting her for cutting her off while expressing those feelings (because when she wanted to talk about it, I needed to leave for work), I was being unfair for not putting myself in her shoes after she gave me 6 months (actually 4 months) of her time, that driving to my house was wasting her time & that she's realized I don't value her time. \r She also said she enjoyed watching my daughter & that it wasn't about the money.\n\n\r  \nI'm at a loss.

Its more appropriate.\n\n> she gave me 6 months (actually 4 months) of her time, \n\nNo she didn't. To give your time you must be getting nothing in return. You were paying her.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a business arrangement for childcare that wasn't never-ending and at the discretion of your friend.  Your friend kept changing the arrangement such that it no longer fit your needs.  Therefore, you changed your childcare.  People change childcare providers all the time.\n\nYou don't need to put yourself in her shoes cuz it's business for you.  You are not a charity.  She knew the parameters when she accepted the arrangement so complaining about driving and such is total BS.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, considering all of the extra stuff you have been doing for her while she watched your kids, it just sounds like she is just upset that she will no longer have anyone paying for all her expenses for half the week. if she really cared about you/your children she'd be ecstatic that you found a FREE childcare option that allowed you to save money to use on other things for your and your children", "NTA. Your priorities are your family's well being first and foremost, and while obviously there was no mention of any safety issues or anything, the deal you've worked with your MIL is definitely the best for your family's financial well being. \n\nThe only question I would have is how much notice you gave her (it's obviously a change in income, she merited some time to prepare). Did she know this was coming for a couple weeks in advance, or was this all a sudden shift?\n\nShe is being very dramatic, but I'd excuse a lot of that as shock if this came really quickly.", "NTA\n\nI see two possible reasons for the conflict:\n\n1. Your friend felt like you were judging her when you decided to switch to your MIL. She felt like her requests were small and felt offended when they were rejected.\n2. Your friend actually really liked getting an extra $200 + gas money + groceries. She is upset because she feels like she is being punished by losing her reward.\n\nNeither are really your fault\n\n>I was disappointed that she wasn't sticking to what we agreed to\n\nThis might not be a judgement directly, but it is really easy to hear an implied judgement. Saying \"you didn't stick to out agreement\" makes it sound like you think she is dishonest.\n\nIn actuality she is NTA at all for asking to change the terms of your agreement. There wasn't a defined contract period so at any time both you and her can renegotiate.\n\nInstead of saying you are disappointed you might just you understand how the driving could be difficult for her and leave it at that.", "NAH: On the one hand, I think you weren't actually paying her very much for all the time/commuting she was doing. At least where I am, a full day of nanny care is more like $125 per day, though maybe in your region cost of living is lower and your payment is more reasonable than it sounds to me. But I would understand if this arrangement wasn't really working for her or worth it. Clearly, she was trying to tweak things in order to make it seem more worth it on her end. On the other hand, she's the one that decided to switch up the schedule/agreement on you, and I don't think you're wrong for then reassessing and deciding that new situation isn't to your best interest -- since you clearly had other even better options for childcare. In that sense, she seems out of place for being so outraged and put upon after she's the one that decided she wanted different terms!\n\nHonestly, I think a lot of the confusion is in the fact that you were trying to compensate her in all these weird ways (gas, laundry usage, groceries) instead of just deciding a clear rate that she and you could both more clearly understand nad feel good about. So YTA insofar as you as employer had the power to set terms but mostly made it confusing. \n\nBut you were under no obligation to keep hiring her at all, so I think she's out of line for feeling affronted that you didn't want to keep her on perpetually. In that regard, NTA for putting an end to it.\n\nBasically, this ararngement just wasn't a good fit, and so I think it is for the best it ended. She can hopefully find something closer to her and better paying. You have found somebody who is willing to do the labor for even a cheaper rate and more convenient format.", "NTA, but you get what you pay for. I'd be more concerned about her taking weed breaks while she's responsible for two young children.", "NTA, but here's my hot take: i feel like since you were/are friends, she probably felt blindsided by you suddenly just making the decision to end your arrangement, without bringing it up as a possibility first and letting her get used to the idea before having it be set in stone? \n\nlike maybe she would've been like oh shit, that's a really good deal for you, you should take it. or maybe she would've made a counteroffer, but either way you would've shown her that you cared more about her feelings and any potential impact on your friendship than getting free childcare.", "massive YTA\n\nthere\u2019s no way 40$ per day is the going rate for babysitters, maybe childcare facilities with 40+ kids, but not for lone babysitters, she was dedicating 40+ hours a week (transport and working hours) to your child. I did the maths, 160$ divided by 40= 4$ per hour, im not american but isn\u2019t that like \u20ac2? barley enough to buy a fucking bottle of water \n\nI understand circumstances change, I don\u2019t blame you for changing babysitters, but you should absolutely write your friend an apology with a small sum of money. I don\u2019t think you should give her the job back, but u owe her that atleast after bailing her.", "NTA\n\nYou took your MIL up on her offer, which is convenient and saves you money. You didn't leave her hanging and communicated clearly that plans have changed. It's far better, too, to have your child cared for by a family member. I don't see that claims of you gaslighting her, and her time wasn't wasted, which is what she was getting paid for. You don't owe anyone explanations of why you chose to take your MIL up on their offer, either. You were also being fair about the pay, considering you've claimed in your area sitters make about that much.", "NTA, you changed your child care provider, it happens, she needs to get over it.", "YTA - you excuse pay $5/hr by saying it\u2019s the going rate. You\u2019re badly underpaying someone and think nothing of it. Don\u2019t you feel bad about that? The gas and drive makes it even worse.", "Im ok with downvotes. But YTA\n\nYou were exploiting your \u201cfriend\u201d (that\u2019s about $6 an hr). And even the \u201cextras\u201d don\u2019t even make it minimum wage in most states (assuming he in the states). She\u2019s right. She is putting a huge number of miles on her car which you\u2019re not accounting for and it sounds like you pay her under the table so she can\u2019t even write them off. \n\nI too wld put my child in free daycare so you\u2019re NTA for making that switch. Just for acting like you were doing her a favor", "NTA\n\nIt looks like you and your husband tried to accommodate her and her daughter in every way possible then she got greedy and demanding. \n\nYou need to let this go. Do NOT engage with her any further. It's history now and you must close the book on her. Block her number and on social media. \n\nShe showed you who she is and for you to waste any more energy on her will cost you way more than you can afford mentally.\n\nEDIT: A person watching children shouldn't be smoking/taking weed breaks.", "Your view: It seems clear that you valued her work, because you paid her $X/hour + laundry, groceries, and other bonuses. \n\nHer view: She gave her best while struggling through a tough life as a single mom, only to have a key source of income taken away. All she did was ask to make a little schedule change, and she was fired. \n\nYou need to work on your listening skills. Please, recognize that you are in a position of power with your friend, and be careful about it. Be a better friend.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone is gaslighting here it's not you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unfortunately you came across the reason it can be a bad idea to mix business and friendship, because your friend mixed up the ending of the business relationship with the end of the friendship. And she leveraged the friendship to keep her employment. \n\nAnd, someone who is watching children should not be taking breaks to smoke weed while watching the kids.", "NTA\n\nShe offered a service that doesn't fit your needs. You're not obligated to keep paying it.", "NTA  Time to move on from this 'friendship'!", "NTA.\n\nIn all honesty, the second I read that she took breaks to smoke weed I decided I wouldn't want her watching my child. I mean, if my childminder took mind altering substances whilst watching my kid I'd remove her immediately. Weed or booze, that's not really OK regardless of the other issues.", " NTA. Why would you pay someone to watch your daughter when you\u2019ve got someone who will do it for free.", "I\u2019m shocked his arrangement wasn\u2019t ended earlier if she was smoking weed while watching your child. NTA for the circumstances you ended the deal for.", "As a mom. I can only guess she's mad for the easy ride she had and wanted you to feel guilty. If she can't see how this helps your daughter more than she's not a friend", "Not only paying her, you were supplying all sorts of things - groceries, laundry facilities,  gas, art space, etc. She got greedy and then got mad when she realized she was losing out on a very generous situation.", "I gave her about a month notice. She is also a stay at home parent normally, which is why she said it wasn't about the money.", "I do think you have a good point there.", "OP said that's the DAYCARE rate (aka where the teacher has a bunch of kids with multiple paying parents) , so an actual sitter would actually probably cost significantly more. Nanny costs are always higher than daycare rates.", "I did \"think something\" of it. That's why I paid for her gas and groceries and tried to create more benefits for her. \n\nI asked someone else this: as a parent, what would you think is a fair pay for someone that isn't a licensed or certified caregiver, whom you allow to nap, watch tv and exercise on the job while they also care for their own child, and you also purchased groceries and gas for? Plus they would go secretly smoke weed while caring for your kid.", "I would hardly call OP essentially cutting her grocery/gas expenses in half exploitation. the $40/day is certainly an unreasonably low rate for an actual sitter/nanny, but we are talking about a friend that is coming over, eating for free, gas paid for, doing laundry, napping, smoking weed AND being assisted by the husband when needed since he WFM. That just sounds like what friends would do for each other, its certainly what I'd do for my friends, the $40 is just a bonus on top at that point.", "It depends on where I think.

I think the judgment there applies on both sides. Not impressed with either  here.", "I'm sorry but you are making assumptions. She is not a single mom. She is a SAHM and her boyfriend is the primary income source for them. I also am not sure where you got that she struggles and lives a tough life.\n\nAnd I never got a chance to listen to her. In my original post, I said she decided to try to talk to me about her feelings as I was leaving for work and then wrote me a letter telling me how she felt instead of asking to have a face to face conversation. I did ask if she would meet up with me after I read her letter so we could discuss her feelings in person, as I do value them and her.", "So if no changes had been made and MIL offered to take care of the child for free would OP have been in the wrong to change sitters? Or is she permanently obligated to this agreement simply because she is her friend?", "Yeah, well, of course it's about the money and it should be. Nobody drives 40 minutes to spend major hours watching somebody elses kid just for the heck of it. She was being dishonest or unrealistic/naive  with herself if she thought that. My sense is both of you were being way to sloppy with this because it was \"friends.\" Next time you should only hire childcare with a clear contract with normal salary (not paid in laundry water), and she should only accept jobs that have a clear agreement about a normal salary (so that she knows it is sustainable and worth her time as agreed-upon).", "That's plenty of notice, she really has no basis to complain - she can be disappointed, she might have enjoyed quite a few aspects of this (gas, groceries, laundry, plus obviously the money she claims it's not about), but you're not harming her by no longer giving her those perks.\n\nShe's acting very immature and making this very personal. That's not your fault, that's squarely on her not being able to control her own emotions.", "You massively underpaid her and got really bent out of shape over a simple schedule change request. \n\nYour employer stats aren\u2019t looking great.", "Nanny costs are usually higher but we still need to take into account the free food, gas money and that her daughter was coming with her, not to mention extra accommodation. That should make up the difference between nanny and daycare rates.", "Didn't catch that!! Thanks for pointing that out to me. I still don't think NTA.", "3 times a week for months? A favor for a friend is once in a while. Also babysitters always eat for free that\u2019s not an extra. The laundry sure. But she agreed to it. The gas is really the only extra. \n\nI work from the comfort of my own home and get to do all the things the friend is doing without kids and make a lot more than $40 a day.", "I completely agree with you. I wasn't aware of the weed smoking until recently. I found out she would go out into my garage to have a quick smoke while our kids were napping and my husband was in his daily meeting. When I asked my husband about it he said she never smelled like weed and \"didn't seem high\".", "I apologize for the assumption. \n\nI did, and still do, think changing sitters is obviously the right thing for you. \n\nI was (badly, it seems) trying to make the point that your friend is stuck in her feelings, and can\u2019t see the facts. She\u2019s simply not dealing with the facts, so if you respond rationally, it will only upset her. I encourage you to just listen to her, not to do what she wants.", "EXACTLY! It's free childcare! Not only that she will be bonding with family as well. It seems like an easy choice to me.", "How is asking my MIL about making the change she requested happen getting bent out of shape? Sure, I was frustrated but I understood why she wanted it and so I asked regardless.\n\nI guess as a parent, what would you pay someone that isn't a licensed or certified caregiver, whom you allow to nap, watch tv and exercise on the job while they also care for their own child, and you also purchased groceries and gas for?

She's making more than she would if she just stayed home, and not paying for herself or her daughter's own groceries for half the week. at the end of the day the only \"loss\" on the friends end is the wear and tear on the car, which an extra 240 minutes of driving a week is not going to destroy her car, especially since it was only over a few months.\n\nand also who cares if its 3 times a week for months? the friend also \"agreed to it\", and is now just mad she found an alternative. if the friend was really being \"exploited\" she would be happy to not have to do it anymore, very clear the only reason she is upset is because she got nothing but benefits from that arrangement from her perspective and now she won't", "I think I made the assumption about a tough life based on her behavior. It seems to me she responded like someone who is overwhelmed.", "There\u2019s no need for the frustration re the schedule though. It comes across as quite high and mighty. \n\nIt would depend on the area and COL, but I\u2019d be paying at least $20 p/hour. The rest of the paragraph is just waffle. What you were offering falls a long way short. If they\u2019re not worth that as an \u2018unlicensed care giver\u2019 (there\u2019s that disdain again) then they\u2019re not fit to leave your child with. \n\nYes, she was wrong to smoke weed, but that\u2019s a separate issue.", "I appreciate the apology. I do think you are correct about her being in her feelings. Another poster made a good point about her feeling blindsided, so I'm going to take your advice and just listen to her.", "That wasn't my intention, but I'm sure many parents would be a little frustrated when they have to change up their child's schedule. Especially when there was already an agreement to completely change it in the near future.\n\nI don't think that by not being licensed/certified meant she wasn't fit to watch my child. Any job I've ever had I've only ever been paid more due to my qualifications. Which she doesn't have. Not to mention I've also agreed to the pay when I've accepted a job. Which she did.", "NTA, but this is why it's best not to do business with friends.\nYour friend is too sensitive on the subject. It seems like it was nothing personal. Grandma said she'd take her for free, so why wouldn't you go that route?", "I'm not sure your math is correct. I came up with 30.5 hrs total. M-W (each day): 8.5 hrs working, 1.5 hr travel, F: 5 hrs working, no travel.\n\nYou also forget that I paid for her gas and groceries. And allowed many things that most average paying employers would never. She also doesn't have required qualifications that many of those daycares with 40+ kids ask for. Not to mention she agreed to the pay because for her it wasn't about the money as she is a SAHM.", "And letting her smoke weed whilst watching her child.   Am I the only person that sees something wrong in that."]}
