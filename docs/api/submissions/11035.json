{"id": 11035, "submission_id": "11d1gje", "title": "AITA for not splitting the cost of a holiday dinner?", "selftext": "  \n\nThis happened quite a few years ago but it\u2019s still brought up every now and then and I'm perceived to be the bad guy.\n\nI was a staff member in a college organization. We had decided to host a holiday party for staff, interns, and general members. The expectation was to split the total cost of the food among everyone attending and we would each pay $10. I was fine until they started suggesting lots of peanut dishes. I\u2019m allergic to peanuts and reminded the others. I can still be in the room with peanuts but if I inhale it too closely or eat a small bit, I\u2019d have a bad reaction. When they remembered they assured me that there will be \"alternatives\" so I can still eat. \n\nI didn't want to risk cross-contamination though so I said I will pack my own food. This alarmed them. They insisted that I don't need to do that, because there will be other options. After the meeting ended, the president Kaylee texted me to remind me I don't need to pack food.\n\nThe day of the party, I packed my own food anyways because I've had reactions before when the food was all cooked together or nearby. One of the other staff members encouraged me to eat this one dish because it was so good and she was \u201cpretty sure\u201d it had no peanuts. I asked Kaylee to be sure where the alternative was, she said she and the VP, Nick, decided against ordering it because I\u2019d said I'd pack my own food. I said, Okay...Just found it weird since they were so insistent that I didn't need to, and if I hadn't done so already as a precaution, I wouldn't have had food until I got home.\n\nNick even came over during the party to ask why I was eating from a meal prep container, and I told him what Kaylee said. He said, \"Oh yeah I forgot about that.\"\n\nAfter the party I got a Venmo charge for $30. I texted Kaylee and Nick together to ask why it was double what we initially agreed on. They said they made the executive decision earlier that night to have staff members pay for interns' and members\u2019 portions too as a present. At this point, I was frustrated because they didn't make that transparent beforehand. Furthermore, I didn't even get to eat the ordered food. I didn't think I should've had to pay at all considering they went back on their word to accommodate for my food allergy. \n\nI told them this was unfair to me and declined the Venmo charge, and things were tense after that. Decisions involving the whole staff kept being made without my knowing and I was informed after the fact. They offered rides to mandatory off-campus events to everyone on staff and interns except me, and I got a stern talk from Kaylee about not finding an alternative means of transportation.\n\nI resigned at the end of the year since the same people would be in charge the next year. Again, this happened years ago but I still talk to 1-2 people from this group due to mutuals. Sometimes they bring this up as the \"hill that you refused to die on for some reason, remember when you were so stubborn?\"\n\nSo was I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1677468442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d1gje/aita_for_not_splitting_the_cost_of_a_holiday/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d tell them I\u2019m sorry my hill to die on metaphorically wasn\u2019t the one I wanted to die on literally.", "ESH. Was it that big of a deal thet you could not chip in $30 and end up being th eoffice pariah and them for upping the ante unilaterally.  But knowing what happened perhaps this will effect what you do in  a similar situation in the future", "The 1-2's people perspective is that if I had relented to their insistence and agreed to not pack my own food, then Kaylee and Nick would've had no reason to go back on their word about food accommodations. This framing made me feel uncomfortable, but I guess even after all this time, they think I made our executives look like the bad guys that night by not eating the food they bought and cooked, and then not paying my share.", "If I'm really close to peanuts (like if someone next to me is eating it), I get itchy but it isn't life or death. If I actually eat it though, my throat starts closing up. Maybe because I told them it wasn't usually life or death for me, they didn't think it was that serious?", "As a college student.. yes $30 is a big deal especially when it contributes nothing to you lmfao", "As a recent college student, $30 was definitely not considered affordable for me at that time... I don't think it is good to assume that it is affordable for others.", "That's so bad, all you did was pack a safe meal for you to be able to eat that day. Even if they were insisting they should've respected you for even wanting to bring your own food. Peanut allergies are no joke, they should've not had any food with peanuts knowing that. If they really wanted the food containing peanuts then they need to have safety precautions with signs and warnings not a \"I'm pretty sure there's no peanuts\". If they did make themselves look bad in front of the executives then its their fault, their actions caused this situation to be much bigger than it needed to be imo. From what I've read I think you did your very best and you prioritized your safety over their wants. You agreed on $10, they suddenly asked you for $30, you respectfully declined and stated your reasons why.", "This is your fucking life they\u2019re so flippant about. They\u2019re all so gross I don\u2019t understand why you even talk to them. I don\u2019t have any allergies but literally ensure my events are allergen free or at least safely managed if even a friends plus-one has an allergy. You deserve better friends.", "They are the bad guys, especially for retaliation by not including you in the loop for information  and not providing you with transportation. That's illegal retaliation.", "Continued exposure will escalate the allergic reaction.  You may get itchy now, but keep exposing yourself like that and it may escalate to anaphylaxis.", "This is true.. for you, but I believe the OP could afford the $30 and save themselves a lot of grief. Kind of like extortion isn't it?", "It\u2019s not true for me but for a lot of college students it is. Some people don\u2019t want to blow money on things that have no relevancy to them. OP also shouldnt have to throw in money when 1. the prices were changed from $10 to $30 and 2. he wasn\u2019t accommodated and was still expected to essentially pay for possible anaphylaxis. No way.", "So it boils down to \"Is it worth $30 not to be perceived by everyone in your office as a jerk and that is something they will keep reminding you about for months to come\"", "Given the context of the situation, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it. It says more about them than of OP since no one took OP into consideration. I rather people be mad at me than be a pushover. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Are you forgetting that this person has a peanut allergy and could potentially have a serious reaction?? Is how OP could be viewed by the others valued more than their life??? How would you like it if you had a life threatening allergy and everyone around you was being inconsiderate and their response to your safety concerns were petty? That's a toxic working environment, even restaurants and ice cream places are more considerate and careful. My job is more considerate of allergies of coworkers and I work in retail. You can easily still sue here if something went wrong. OP could've ended up in the hospital, so to prevent that took safety precautions everyone else didn't want to take insisting they have peanuts near them. Then was made to look bad because they expressed their concerns and gave valid reasons why not to pay the $30. It was originally agreed on $10 also. You previously stated that it seems OP could afford it.. how would you know that?? You don't know if that person is living paycheck to paycheck or has additional bills to pay, an extra unexpected $20 can be a huge deal. OP doesn't have to say they can or can't afford it, so unless specifically said don't assume and jump to conclusions about the money. Regardless, OP is valid for not paying because they were not at all respected and $30 was NOT originally agreed upon."]}
