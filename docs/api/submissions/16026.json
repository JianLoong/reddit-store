They\u2019re nice down-to-earth people and we all get on quite well. \n\nFriday night we had dinner at their house. Today we went out- local sightseeing, back for late lunch and drinks. \n\nWas going well. Nice lunch, nice wine with it- we all had quite a bit.\n\nThen went to a nice pub for a few more drinks. It was partner\u2019s round so he went to the bar. \n\nWe found a table next to the window, MIL sat down leaned against the window not realising it was actually open, and fell backwards. Luckily only into a big window box/ flower planter thing a few inches below the window. \n\nShe screamed with the initial shock and then fell into the flower box. \n\nUnfortunately seeing this and then her on her back waving her arms and legs like a beetle (she obviously wasn\u2019t hurt), I started laughing hysterically and couldn\u2019t stop.  My wife is quite small and struggled to help her mum (who is quite heavy) up. I couldn\u2019t help because I\u2019d totally lost it (not being horrible but it was funny).  Her partner came back with drinks and helped her out (he was quite pissed at me though). She was embarrassed and wet and muddy and we ended up leaving soon after.  Side-eye from my wife all the way back. As soon as we were alone I got the hissy fit from her about being disrespectful to her mother. \n\nWe\u2019re now back at their house. We\u2019re sat here in silence - I wasn\u2019t the pub leaving the window open, or the MIL drinking too much but I\u2019m the bad guy for not leaping into action. \n\nHonestly AITA here?", "created_utc": 1682798726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1335b1u/aita_for_laughing_when_my_mil_fell_out_of_a/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
