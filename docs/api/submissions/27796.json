He came to visit me over the summer holidays. My parents booked a place for them and us in a coastal town. But suddenly he was in a rush to get back to my home town and our university town. Supposedly his dad booked a room a guesthouse for him in our uni town, so he had to go stay there. (Not the same town as home.) I couldn't understand why his dad would book a room for him when he knows we are on vacation and that bf is staying with us. I explained that if he were to go stay there, I am not going to be driving after him every day, but I'll say goodbye before his flight.  My mom has a sixth sense or something, but she got the idea to ask him about a friend (female) and when he will be seeing her while I wasn't present. His response? He was heading to visit her the following day and will be staying with her (in her flat) for couple days. He didn't speak to me once while there. Made some lame excuses. And then she posted very cosy looking photks of the two of them on social media. Do I have proof he cheated? No. Though he blatantly lied to me. He didn't tell me about any of his plans because he knew I'd react \"like that\". I couldn't trust him after that. I tried to still make things work, but I was not happy. Broke up with him. He didn't even seem bothered that I did and blamed me for everything wrong in the relationship and that I wasn't as fun anymore.

You paid for his flight to go on vacation and now he is pestering you to go meet up with a bestie girl alone.  I have to keep checking your ages to make sure he\u2019s not 20. If you can\u2019t justify why this is a GOOD man, let him go hook up with Monica.  Might be a good test.  You aren\u2019t his mommy, he doesn\u2019t need permission.

There is none of that here. \n\nShe isn't surprised in the slightest that her BF's childhood friend in at the location of their holiday? Surely you'd mention that? Unless of course there was a conversation beforehand, one that is important when setting up the premise she has. \n\nAlso\n\n\"Earlier today he asked me if I would *allow* him to meet up with her alone so they could catch up\"\n\nIf a guy had posted this, people would be leaping over themselves to question the word \"allow\" They'd use it to question whether in fact, the guy is controlling, jealous, and abusive. Because it sure as hell can sound that way if you really want it to. \n\n\"He keeps saying I don\u2019t let him do anything\"\n\nSure... I imagine that was the entirety of his argument to go and meet his childhood friend /s", "This annecdotal nonsense is meaningless.  You have no reall basis for claiming what the average reponse is. As it stands I can vaguely remember one similar story where the friend was established and in need, the situation was oppenly discussed and the partner was not excluded form the contact. \n\nThat is not the same as meeting up a stranger, excluding your partner because you are activly trying to hide things from her and then sneaking of in the middle of the night behind their back.\n\nYou missunderstanding something here. OP is not saying she is or not allowing anything, he is. Often guys have their head so far up their own ass with this \"your not the boss of me\" BS that any form of reasonable compromise is painted as being controlled and being allowed. Again wanting to come along and meet some one who is such a big deal is not unreasonable."]}
