I\u2019ve never met this girl, but ive heard about her in passing. \n\nSince we arrived she has been blowing up his phone. Earlier today he asked me if I would allow him to meet up with her alone so they could catch up. I asked why I couldn\u2019t go and he said because he wanted to tell her things and didn\u2019t want to make her feel bad in front of me. I said no. I told him we could all go out together to eat or to a bar. This was around 11pm\u2026 he did not solidify any plans so I figured we were staying in for the night. I took a shower, did my skincare, and went asleep for the night. Its now 2am and he very silently whispered \u201cok babe I\u2019ll be back\u201d almost as if to not wake me up. But I heard it, woke up and was like where are you going? He told me he was going out with her. I immediately got up and got upset asked him why he was sneaking out and it started a huge fight. He ended up not leaving and now I\u2019m starting to feel bad about maybe being so anal about it.\nHe keeps saying I don\u2019t let him do anything and I\u2019m lame for going to sleep at 11pm while we\u2019re on vacation (we were out all day on an 8hr excursion so I was pretty tired).

He totally thought he could say he told you he was leaving and you didn\u2019t say anything so he thought it was fine. He assumed you were dead asleep and wouldn\u2019t hear it. Leaving at that hour to meet up with another woman who you had already expressed you didn\u2019t want him to is really not ok. You came on vacation together and didn\u2019t know anything about this childhood bf. She\u2019s not part of your mutual vacation plans and it\u2019s odd he wants to meet her alone during the vacation you\u2019re on together.", "NTA. Ur completely valid for questioning him for wanting to hangout with another girl near midnight and trying to sneak out for her at 2 am. \n\nAlso, another red flag, what does he have to tell her that he can\u2019t tell u?? Ur literally his gf. And what does he want to say that would make her feel bad in front of u?", "You are not lame at going to sleep at 11:00 pm, particularly after an all day excursion.\n\nHe was sneaking out at 2:00 am to be with her.  Are the bars open that late where you are staying?  It seems VERY suspicious. \n\nYou are not be controlling.  You are very reasonably asking to be included as you have not met her and you have PAID for this trip.\n\nNTA.", "Sneaking out at 2am is totally innocent behavior /s. \n\nNTA. I would be convinced he\u2019s up to no good.", "lol NTA. He's clearly trying to F\\*\\*k around. Not allowing you to come allong is a big red flag, he should be happy to introduce you as part of his life.  Sneaking of at 2AM while you are asleep is just beyond insane its all but catching him red handed. \n\nYeah maybe he prefers parties to excursions but he could have communicated that and he knew what the plan was. Just sounds like a childish and overentitled f\\*\\*kboy.", "1. Who paid for the vacation is irrelevant.\n\n2. He\u2019s behaving rudely and suspiciously. He should want to introduce you to her, over coffee or lunch.\n\n3. A request to meet her in hotel bar to drink and catch up for an hour or two is fine after you have met her, for a limited period of time, with the understanding you can join them or not if you find the reminiscing boring. Personally I love hanging back listening to people talk about my guy when younger but not everyone does.\n\n4. The slipping out at 2 am is totally suspicious.\n\nNTA and wtf is wrong with your bf? And her too, frankly.", "Sounds like he conned you into shouting him a holiday to hook up with an old girlfriend and you're keeping tabs on him more than he expected. He doesn't seem like a keeper to me. NTA.", "Why would he be sneaking out at 2 am to meet up another woman unless he was up to no good?", "Hon. He was going to fuck that girl. On the vacation that you paid for. NTA unless you stay with him, then you're the AH to yourself because oh boy this is just the beginning if you stay with him.", "NTA, dude is shady.", "NTA, you 2 are supposed to be on \"vacation\" together.  And I assume you 2 planned that.  Now, while on vacation, he changed \"his\" plan.", "You are totally the A for ruining his plan to cheat on you /s\n\nDefinitely NTA", "INFO: Who suggested this specific location where Monica just happened to be?", "NTA.  He\u2019s cheating and you know he\u2019s cheating.  The only question is whether you\u2019re going to tolerate it.", "Reverse the ganders and you are \"controlling\" and \"abusive\"\nYour partner wanted to meet with his friend to catch up talking about private things and you had to be jealous and controlling and couldn't give him few hours to catch up....I've read enough stories on reddit about guys that didn't want their gf to see their male friend and the guys where AH...so YTA on that part", "ESH. He wants to meet with his friend for a couple of ours and you did not allow it. Who are you to dictate his movements? He is sneaking out at 2am in the morning. What? Your both acting like teenagers. Maybe address the elephant in the room and communicate with other.", "ESH. I think you could have both worked to find a compromise. The compromise you offered wasn't really a compromise as you didn't allow for any alone time. Equally,  your bf didn't try and see it from your pov, and instead of trying to work something out, he tried to sneak out like a teenager. \n\nIt is understandable that your bf wants to catch up with his childhood friend on his own whilst he is there.  It is also understandable that you might feel insecure about this. You paying for him is neither here nor there for this particular conflict,  unless he was to spending the whole vacation with her then yes he would def be ta. One evening where you all meet up for dinner then he stays for an hour for catch up time shouldn't ruin the holiday. \n\nThis all said, I'd want to know what's going to be telling her that is going to be upsetting to her her and I think it would have been reasonable for you to ask him this before making a decision about them meeting up.", "YTA So the guy wants to meet his childhood best friend and you say no...\n\nYou laid out your boundaries which he obviously thought were restrictive so he snuck out to do what he wanted to do. \n\nFact #1 You don't trust him.\nFact #2 He doesn't respect your boundaries. \n\nThis relationship is probably over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s trying to cheat on you. Dump him.", "Nta - his behaviour is suspicious and wrong", "I feel he is the AH here. He sounds horrid.", "NTA. He was headed out for a hook up, probably someone he met online. He used you for the free flight. When you get home, dump him.", "So what if you hadn't heard him and stopped him when you did? Do you think he'd have told you in the morning? My guess is, he'd have snuck out at 2 and been back at 5 and you'd be none the wiser when you wake up in the morning. He didn't get away with it this time. But what about the next time? And the one after that? Are you going to have to supervise him 24/7/365 for you to have this farce of a relationship?
