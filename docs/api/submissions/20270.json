Yeah sucks you were speeding, but to be fair lots of people speed.  Did he tell you to slow down anytime during the drive?   I can see him blaming you more if he asked you to slow down, and you didn't, but since you didn't say anything in that regard I'm guessing he did not.  You bailed him out that was nice of you.  He was an idiot for leaving the pipe in plain view whether or not it belonged to you.  You had given it over to him to store, so at that point it was his action that left it in plain sight.  To be frank, you were all at fault for getting caught but you all knew what you were doing was against the law and just need to deal with the consequences.  The issue is the weed was his, so he's the one going to get the felony charge.", "He got a felony possession charge over carts?!
