Both pets have lived with other animals, dogs and cats, in the past.\n\nThis past week I came home one day and I could not find my cat. After 10 minutes of looking I found him behind the toilet in the bathroom not looking good. I helped him out from behind to find a huge cut and bleeding on his right shoulder area. There was lots of blood I immediately took him to the vet. \n\nHe ended up needed to stay overnight and get stitches. I contacted my Ally while at the vet and she said \u201coh yea my cat got him pretty good, so I locked yours in the bathroom.\u201d My vet bill ended up being over $600 when all said and done and my cat had to be monitored for about 14 days after. I talked to Ally about it and she admitted that she left the cats alone together because she wanted to play video games and hers attacked mine and she didn\u2019t know what to do she locked mine in the bathroom so she could continue her game and forgot about him.\n\nWhen I got home from the vet I took the bill to Ally and said we are splitting the bill. She instantly got upset and said there is no way she should have to pay for that when it is my cat. I told her that her actions and pet caused the accident and she needs to be more careful when introducing pets. Ally is refusing to pay half the bill. I told her that if she can\u2019t own up and pay half the bill that I cannot have her living with me. \n\nIf I can\u2019t trust her to be alone with our pets I don\u2019t want my cat getting more hurt in the future because of her. Our coworkers are now telling me that I am in the wrong because I shouldn\u2019t be giving her a pay or move out ultimatum.

Just because it is her cat does not mean all vet responsibilities fall on her. It is the roommates fault there were bills in the first place!", "Maybe you should try reading the post again, the cat WAS  in her own room, the room mate let it out. \n\nAlso the your animal so all the vet fees are your responsibility is laughably untrue, otherwise we wouldn't have courts and lawsuits. \n\nSpeaking of, an ultimatum is better than a lawsuit!", "In 35 years of taking in homeless (often feral) cats I have never had them fight to the point of hurting themselves to the extent that they needed medical care.  Closest I came to that was when a kitten bit one of the older cats on the bum and it got infected--and that was because the older cat was immunocompromised and undergoing chemo.  So in my opinion, roommate's cat has some concerning issues.  Frankly, the local feral cats typically treat each other better than that!\n\nAnd in no instance is it ok to just throw an injured cat into the bathroom and forget about it.  That indicates a total absence of personal responsibility and regard for living creatures.  For those reasons alone, I'd get her out as soon as possible.   She doesn't have the potential to be a good roommate (or, arguably, a good human).", "Your cat is traumatized and will now never feel safe in it's own home.  Her and her cat gotta go if you want a healthy cat.", "Another vote for goodbye to this dangerous,  very thoughtless person.  I wouldn't even qualify her as a roommate.", "I edited my post to reflect that. Thank you", "You should add this in an edit to your post. Anybody who is saying something other than \"NTA\" seems to think you were just letting you cat roam free unsupervised and that you were irresponsible. But it's clear with this detail that you were responsible and your roommate was negligent.", "I made my comment before OP said that in reply to a different comment and I'm not psychic lol.\n\nBut yeah that changes the situation completely. OP is NTA Ally should pay 100% of the bill because it's 100% her fault and she should leave too and find a different living situation if she won't pay that bill.", "Maybe you should read the post again because I did and that isn't there. It's in a comment OP made later. After I posted this.", "Yes, these cats cannot live together safely. Your cat needs to be your priority and you need to kick out the roommate immediately.", "Of course, things get lost in all the comments.", "Even without that information, giving you the benefit of the doubt, even if both cats were wandering free, the room mate would STILL be legally responsible because she observed the incident and made zero efforts to notify either OP or a Vet. She locked it in a bathroom and forgot about it to game."]}
