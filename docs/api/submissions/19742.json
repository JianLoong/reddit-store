I am solely on the lease and she lives with me but has not signed a lease yet It has only been 2 weeks. We both have one cat and have been slowly introducing them to each other. Both pets have lived with other animals, dogs and cats, in the past.\n\nThis past week I came home one day and I could not find my cat. After 10 minutes of looking I found him behind the toilet in the bathroom not looking good. I helped him out from behind to find a huge cut and bleeding on his right shoulder area. There was lots of blood I immediately took him to the vet. \n\nHe ended up needed to stay overnight and get stitches. I contacted my Ally while at the vet and she said \u201coh yea my cat got him pretty good, so I locked yours in the bathroom.\u201d My vet bill ended up being over $600 when all said and done and my cat had to be monitored for about 14 days after. I talked to Ally about it and she admitted that she left the cats alone together because she wanted to play video games and hers attacked mine and she didn\u2019t know what to do she locked mine in the bathroom so she could continue her game and forgot about him.\n\nWhen I got home from the vet I took the bill to Ally and said we are splitting the bill. She instantly got upset and said there is no way she should have to pay for that when it is my cat. I told her that her actions and pet caused the accident and she needs to be more careful when introducing pets. Ally is refusing to pay half the bill. I told her that if she can\u2019t own up and pay half the bill that I cannot have her living with me. \n\nIf I can\u2019t trust her to be alone with our pets I don\u2019t want my cat getting more hurt in the future because of her. Our coworkers are now telling me that I am in the wrong because I shouldn\u2019t be giving her a pay or move out ultimatum.

Kick her out whether or not she pays. Your cat was seriously injured and she didn't call you or a vet or make any effort to attend to his wounds.

This is not a person who can be trusted to be alone in your home with your pet.", "NTA, she should be paying all of it since it was *entirely* her fault it happened, you're being generous asking for only half. It's not even like she lost control of the situation, she just gave up on taking care of them.\n\nHaving said that, while I can understand you not wanting to live with this person, you should look at your local laws.
