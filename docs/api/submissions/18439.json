I'm glad that my bf and I have a somewhat easy time finding things we both want to enjoy, but we still have the odd argument about some things. \n\nI think it's unfair to expect someone to watch a whole tv series if they dislike it. Tv series are so long and just too much to get through, especially if you are watching more than one episode at a time. Neither I nor my bf would expect each other to go through that because it ruins each person's experience. It's absolute torture (for me at least) to imagine sitting through hours and hours of content just because someone I love watches it. Couldn't be me.

It's unfair.\n\nBut there has to be some things you have in common or some other compromise you two can get through without being mean.

And he can give me that much time so I can share something I love with the man I love. And there are so many other shows that y'all can watch together. There has to be something you both like!

I suggest trying a kind of 'cultural exchange' where you both get to pick an hour of entertainment for you to watch together and see if there's anything that you can find in common. Like, if you put on an hour of car shows and talk to her about why you enjoy it, then she puts on an hour of fantasy stuff and she talks to you about why she likes it.

To be in a relationship, you need to have something in common, something you both enjoy. Find it and go do that, it doesn't have to be watching TV.

I don't feel the need to repeat what others have said. \n\nI just want to put out there that taste is subjective. Everyone's taste and opinion is right... for them. (This is separate from facts, which conservatives need to figure out the difference.) So even though I think your taste in movies sucks, it's just right for you. Clearly you're not the only one who likes that crap because they keep making more of those stupid Fast and Furious movies. But guess what? I don't love you or care about you, so I don't have to be supportive of your taste in movies. If I don't like my husband's taste in something, I'm not going to bad mouth it. What people like is a facet of themselves. When you berate their favorite things, especially things they want to share with you, it's natural to take it personally. If she's adamant about sharing something with you, I wouldn't say you have to watch a whole season with her. You can just respond kindly, \"I really do not enjoy this show. I'm glad you enjoy it, but it feels frustrating to spend a lot of time on something I do not enjoy.\" It's not hard not to be mean. \n\n2 suggestions: \n1. Find something to do that you can be with her while she watches. My husband plays his PS5 remotely next to me while I'm watching something he's not into. I'll also knit next to him while he plays a game I'm only interested in for the cut scenes. \n2. Try to find things you might enjoy together. It doesn't have to be shows, but there might be some you both could like. What comes to mind for me is Initial D. That's an anime about racing. Or maybe Attack on Titan if you're looking for action. There's plenty of anime that has cars and explosions that maybe you both could enjoy. \n\nI am curious. Do you love her? And why are you with her?", "First of all you need to differentiate YOUR taste in TV shows, from what \u201cGOOD\u201d TV shows are.\n\nMany excellent shows can exist outside of your subjective taste. So when your wife likes a TV show - its doesn\u2019t mean its a bad TV show just because you don\u2019t like it. A show can have quality and worth even if it isnt about cars and \u201chard action\u201d.  Stop acting so superior when your taste in media is probably Fast and Furious.\n\nNext, if you don\u2019t like the same TV shows, then simply don\u2019t watch TV together. Do another activity. Don\u2019t ruin the things she likes just because you don\u2019t. Its so immature. And learn to say that the show isn\u2019t your taste without being an AH. Throwing tour weight around and whining and whinging like a 6 yo child. Grow up.\n\nLastly, the way you are going about doing things that you don\u2019t explicitly like is very childish. Sometimes you watch a show with your wife because you like her and want to spend some time together. Grow up. YTA.", "> I love my wife.

We are mostly good at it together but when we lapse or things get off kilter boy can we tell.", "Women be shopping, amirite fellas??  \n\nUgh.", "Exactly this happens with us with movies. He doesn't like movies that are too action packed, like the Fast and Furios saga, but my mom and I enjoy them. So my husband would see the advertisement for it and go \"you can totally watch that with your mom\".", "Not related but I love how \u201cthe whales Star Trek\u201d is loves so widely outside of the fandom.", ">Have posted this before but while I was growing up, I heard a lot of \"if you don't fight with your partner you're not REALLY in love.\"\n\nI was once at a bus stop and two older teenagers were talking about this very thing. Also stuff like, if he's jealous that means he loves you kind of garbage.\n\nI so wanted to tell them otherwise but knew they'd just see me as the weird old lady so I just was sad in silence.", "Seriously, they make women out to be a completely different species with bizarre biology and brain function.

The one who likes it watches it independently, the other is free to play on their phone/read/do chores/be somewhere else while it's on. If the show changes significantly, the one who doesn't like it _may_ choose to watch with the one who does like it.\n\n3) We both agree that it's not something we want to watch and then spend the next hour fruitlessly scrolling through streaming sites to find something we *do* want to watch.\n\nIt works because we communicate and respect that we have some similar and some differing preferences.\n\nOP, YTA.", "I thought that \u201cThe One With The Whales\u201d was the official name.", "The people who say things like this tend to either only learn the ability to have empathy if you do it back to them, or are so fragile and thin-skinned that they flip out in rage if you do it back to them.", "FR. I am 40 years old and there was this little boy who probably did have a crush on me when I was in grade two, and he was awful. One day he pushed me down some concrete steps, and I ended up breaking bones. I was a gymnast and a dancer and it put me out of my favorite hobbies for three months. It was a horrific incident, I was so upset and mad. And all everyone kept saying to comfort me was, \"he did it because he likes you.\" Wtf. I went through domestic abuse as an adult - thankfully I am out of that now - but when I look back at childhood incidents with abusive boys, and how they were handled by the adults around me, I'm not surprised that I ended up thinking it was normal to be treated like garbage by men who \"liked\" me.", "I wonder how he reacts when he sees a firetruck.", "I know, I have been there and so has she but to a much worse degree tho, and I think that she\u2019s kind of having these internal rationalizations, like it\u2019s not THAT bad at least.

He\u2019s so downright cruel at times (these are not the worst comments, he has said stuff I HATE about her kid with special needs like \u201cyou have to break his will\u201d) but the wedding is in like 20 days so I\u2019m supporting her as much as possible, but I\u2019m not ever the friend who\u2019s gonna help you downplay your partner being verbally abusive. Luckily she is still coming to me when she is distressed even tho I don\u2019t make excuses for him. We\u2019ve spent HOURS talking about this, but whenever she confronts him he does the expected thing and spins her in circles and she leaves the convo feeling like it\u2019s her fault \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
