I'm glad that my bf and I have a somewhat easy time finding things we both want to enjoy, but we still have the odd argument about some things. \n\nI think it's unfair to expect someone to watch a whole tv series if they dislike it. Tv series are so long and just too much to get through, especially if you are watching more than one episode at a time. Neither I nor my bf would expect each other to go through that because it ruins each person's experience. It's absolute torture (for me at least) to imagine sitting through hours and hours of content just because someone I love watches it. Couldn't be me. And I can imagine sitting there and wanting someone to like your favorite show but knowing they hate it, it isn't a good feeling. Y'all are torturing each other with this arrangement. It's unfair.\n\nBut there has to be some things you have in common or some other compromise you two can get through without being mean. Like, if I want to watch a movie really bad but my bf isn't interested, he will watch it with me because it's at max 2 hours of his life... Not 40. And he can give me that much time so I can share something I love with the man I love. And there are so many other shows that y'all can watch together. There has to be something you both like!

I suggest trying a kind of 'cultural exchange' where you both get to pick an hour of entertainment for you to watch together and see if there's anything that you can find in common. Like, if you put on an hour of car shows and talk to her about why you enjoy it, then she puts on an hour of fantasy stuff and she talks to you about why she likes it.
