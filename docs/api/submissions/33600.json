I noticed that she got her boyfriend one which i honestly thought was cute, but also noticed that she hadn\u2019t got one for mine (context: i\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year, sister has been dating hers for a week).\n\nI asked her, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get one for my bf too?\u201d and she only said, \u201cBecause i only wanted to get one for my boyfriend.\u201d I didn\u2019t argue, because i kinda understood (but still found it a little rude). I just asked her where she bought them. It was store that\u2019s about 45 minutes away from our house.\n\nThe next day, I went to the store (even though it was a while away, I had other christmas shopping to do anyway) and bought the exact same little mug ornament with my boyfriend\u2019s initial, and put it on the tree.\n\nWhen she saw it, she said, \u201cYou really drove all the way to get your boyfriend an ornament? you\u2019re such a dramatic bitch.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything cause i was shocked that she was upset because i bought an ornament so my boyfriend could feel included. \n\nI asked my mom about it and she said \u201cWell it seems kind of petty that you drove all the way to the store just to buy that ornament.\u201d When i didn\u2019t even mean it that way.\n\nI just honestly don\u2019t see how trying to include my boyfriend in his first christmas at my family\u2019s house is an asshole move? I wasn\u2019t ever even mad at my sister for not buying one, or said anything rude about it.", "created_utc": 1703298248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ovem3/aita_for_buying_an_extra_ornament_for_the_tree/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, you went through some trouble to get an ornament to represent your boyfriend, but you combined it with other errands. \n\nI can understand your sister being annoyed (she\u2019s embarrassed b/c she knows she should have bought one with/ your BF\u2019s initials) b/c that\u2019s a sister thing, but your Mom calling you petty was out of mine. \n\nI mean, my CAT gets her own ornament on my parents\u2019 tree so what do I know LOL", "It's clear your sis doesn't want to include or like your BF at all. \n\nYour sis calling you dramatic B and your mom calling you petty is sign they both are onboard for disliking your BF.\n\nNTA", "Your mom and sister interpreted it as a passive aggressive move. It doesn't sound like it was at all, so you are NTA. It's a bit baffling why they would jump to that conclusion.", "NTA \n\nLike you stated in the post you weren\u2019t mad or upset she didn\u2019t buy one for your bf but that doesn\u2019t make sense why YOU buying one for your bf to feel included is considered \u201cpetty\u201d to them. You bought it with your money, didn\u2019t make a big deal about sister excluding your bf, and just wanted to be considerate of your bfs feelings.", "NTA. Your boyfriend probably would have noticed and that\u2019s a shitty feeling. I would have done the same thing.", "NTA, I hate Christmas and how it makes people act shitty it\u2019s pretty cool that you went out of your way to make your BF feel like part of the family.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks to be left out. You did the right thing.", "Nta what\u2019s up with your family that both your mother and sister saw that as a dig instead of you caring about your bf?

They sound adorable and I kinda want some lol", "Nta. \nThe way I see all partners get an ornament or none do. Anything else is rude.", "NTA but can see where your sister gets her mind set from. It was a very thoughtful thing for you to do to make someone important to you feel included. Very unfortunate to have a mind set like theirs", "NTA, I really dont see how this could be AH behaviour. Honestly it seems kinda fake how un-assholeish you were being", "It sounds like you just wanted your BF to feel included. It's hard for me to see that as petty. Your sister calling you \"a dramatic bitch\" was unnecessarily mean. I guess she felt insulted in some way by you purchasing the ornament yourself? Maybe she felt called out on her \"thoughtlessness\" towards not including your BF or something? I dunno. It kinda sounds more like she's the one \"being dramatic\". She can't have it both ways. If they are \"just ornaments\" and don't mean anything then why does she even care that you bought one? If she hadn't responded so rudely, I'd go with NAH, but her response pushes it into NTA for me.", "NTA. There is nothing petty about this and I\u2019d say you\u2019re the least dramatic out of the bunch.", "NTA. Your sister needs to get over herself.", "NTA!\n\nYour sister is being the drama queen!\n\nwhy does she not want your bf to be included when you've been with yours way longer than she was with hers?\n\nplus didn't you also say you had more shopping anyway? why are they making such a big deal about it?\n\nI think that maybe your sister did what she did deliberately to cause drama!", "[deleted]", "ESH. I don't know why you expected her to buy a personalized ornament for your bf, a year isn't exactly 'part of the family' yet, and it probably was a little petty for you to go get the exact same kind of ornament she got since it takes away from the uniqueness of her purchase. But she overreacted by calling you names. Low stakes problem.", "Esh here's the thing she decided to buy something cute for her family  members for the Christmas tree.  She did same for her BF because he's her BF.  I'm sure she didn't think she had to buy your BF the same item she bought for hers.  She is under no obligation to provide him with the exact gift/sentiment she provided her family members and her own BF.  You made her gift yours.  You just had to buy your BF the exact thing she got hers.  This was her way of including her BF in his first Christmas with your family.  Instead of you having your own method, you copied her.  So she's irritated.", "YTA why copy it? Just go to a local store and buy one cause even if you didnt mean to be it comes off as petty", "I can see why that is petty if she felt like you were trying to make her feel bad. Imo...you should have simply said thats a great idea, do you mind if i got the same thing for my bf. Not said anything about why she didn't buy your bf one. Also, why didn't you buy your bf a different ornament that reflects his personality since you have known him for a year with initials (could have painted on yourself if need be). \n\nSoft yta.", "Mild ESH.

You drove to the store for one ornament,  but I'm predicting it's your sister who wasted her time: I don't know a lot of guys who wouldn't run like an Olympic sprinter if they had a personalized ornament on a girl's family's Christmas tree after a week. Did she get ones for their future babies too??", "NTA\n\nIf anyone was being petty it was your sister. She should have either bought them for all boyfriends or no boyfriends. You were being inclusive.\n\nAnd, frankly, it's not their concern. Not your sister or your mother's.\n\nEDIT: Also, were I your sister's boyfriend, I would think the whole ornament thing was too much since we'd only been dating for a week.", "NTA\n\nyou were doing something thoughtful and sweet for your BF\n\nDid you mom and/or sis have a fight with your BF? Do they dislike him? \n\nIt's the only reason I can think of why they'd be upset to have him included on the tree...otherwise very weird", "She should snag the ornament with the boyfriends initials on it and bring it out next year.

This was not a unique ornament that her sister bought for her bf.", "Some families are much quicker to accept and pull in closer than others.  Just around the year in my case with my wife\u2019s family, they announced that we were going on a family vacation and that I was not only included to be able to go on the trip with them, but considered in their budget and covered the cost for all to go. It really depends", "i didn\u2019t buy just the mug, i said in the post that i had to buy christmas presents anyway :/", "I respect how serious you are about your Christmas ornaments!", "The sister was the one who found the ornaments and bought them though. Of course it's okay for her to buy a cutesie personalized mini christmas mug (gag) for her new bf while she was buying ones for the rest of her family. I don't know why OP also expected her sister to spontaneously buy one for OP's bf too.", "When visitors come over and see the (questionably) cute ornaments, it's no longer accurate to describe them as 'look at these cute ornaments daughter 1 purchased!' Now they're more accurately described as 'look at these cute ornaments my daughters 1 and 2 purchased!'

I was just pointing out that clearly meant nothing to the sister. \n\nOf course the sister doesn\u2019t have to buy an ornament for OP\u2019s bf, but I understand why OP thought she would when she did for the new bf.", "They each have the same ornament with their initials on it. She bought one for her boyfriend so that he would also be represented on the tree, on which his girlfriend, her sister, and her sister\u2019s boyfriend already have matching ornaments.", "I don't since I don't think either of them have been dating their bf's long enough for them to be considered de facto family members. Sister was buying it as a cutesie offhand present to her new beau, not as a way to welcome him into the family. But ofc perfectly happy to agree to disagree :)", "A year is too soon for me too, I\u2019m just pointing out with that is the sister bought ones for all of the family, plus her bf. That does make it seem like a family thing. If she just got her and the bf ornaments that would be a couples thing and OP would be weird for copying that."]}
