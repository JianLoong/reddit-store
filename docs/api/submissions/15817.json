But I understand how the friend would be upset with the situation.", "Yes, because how are you supposed to know your aunt is in a coma when the information is being purposefully withheld?", "yeah except OP paid their share when they paid for the room.  you dont pay for a hotel room after you stay there for the week. you have to pay for entire duration of your stay before you get the room. and if they wanted to move to a different city after OP left they would only need a 2 person room now which means its the same price per person still.\n\nedit: meant to say have to give payment information before you get the room, not pay. the actual charge doesnt happen to your card until the end. but point still stands that they split the bill for the 3 person room with OP so they paid their share", "The guy you are replying to is just looking for a reason to be upset. Lmfao \u2018demand\u2019 your parents give you a reason genuinely sounds like it is writen by a 16 year old. If my mum called essentially begging me to come to her I wouldn\u2019t think twice.", "LoL?! You\u2019re the only one talking about the friend\u2019s reaction as it mattered a lot in this post LMAO!! \nThe 1st comment refers to the parents lack of communication and only says the friend should not have been an AH, and the 2nd says he would feel betrayed if he were in the friends shoes because of the parents lack of communication\u2026", "first comment) calling him an AH is talking about his reaction because the reason they think he\u2019s an AH is because of how he reacted                    second comment) they were saying how they don\u2019t think the friend\u2019s an AH for his behavior \n\nand even if i was the only person to talking about it, you still replied to a comment that was specifically mentioning the friend\u2019s behavior. why respond to a comment like that if that\u2019s not what you want to discuss?", "?? The first comment talks about the parents lack of communication, lack of a reason to leave everything and go. The 2nd says doing THIS is an AH move, he didn\u2019t pass a judged the friend\u2019s reaction at all. You\u2019re the one who focused only on the friends reaction, which everyone here appears to agree it was exaggerated. \n\nMy reply to you was to try and make you understand what it means leaving something planned without a reason, it doesn\u2019t matter who asked, if it\u2019s a good or bad, valid or invalide reason, any excuse it\u2019s better than not giving a reason. Not giving a reason is an AH move, which resulted in a AH reaction. If you have plans with someone, you need to present an excuse to not do it or to leave earlier from it, it\u2019s social convention rules.", "You're 21, old enough to travel, vote, drink, marry, etc. Why are your parents treating you like a child, and why do you allow it?\n\nIn my opinion, ESH. Your parents, your friend, and to some extent, you.", "NTA\n\nAll this talk about the parents being AH's and not enough about this one dude who clearly didn't give a crap about your situation. Do you even like him?", "Good Lord, you paid for the hotel in advance so your 'friends' weren't out a penny.  I think there's a lot of AH's here but you're not one of them...", "*wouldn't have", "For some reason they thought I'd worry less, which is completely not true", "I think that\u2019s a huge assumption to make, can you imagine spending money and planning an entire two week trip in another country with two good friends and one of them decides to leave in the middle, and won\u2019t even explain what\u2019s going on? I\u2019d be disappointed that the group dynamic was all thrown off.", "I was able to pay my share for all the hotels we stayed in including the last one where it was only the 2 of them. The only thing they had left to pay for were individual expenses for any activities they did after I left", "I think the other female friend has a crush on this guy, and he's upset to have to spend half his trip alone with her.", "Before I left we had one hotel left that we were to go to. I still paid for my share of the last hotel since I knew it was what we agreed upon. The 3 of us had been friends since we were in elementary school and my 2 friends definitely hang out independently and have gone on trips with just the 2 of them before", "My mom did this when my dog died \u201ccome to the vet asap something happened\u201d but I get it. I was insanely worried but had I known my pup had passed I would have been too sad to safely drive there. She had to get a family friend to pick up my car from the vet since I was in shock and couldn\u2019t do it. OPs parents might have thought that worry about an unknown might be better and let OP keep a clearer mind than worry about a family members potential passing would.", "Agreed, w/o knowing WHY they wanted you to come home, why ruin an amazing trip.  My mom pulls this all the time but I've gone VERY LC with her the last few years so it's at a minimum now.", "I definitely agree!!", "You need to reimburse them for the remainder of the hotels. They went from expecting to pay 33% to paying 50% because you bailed for mysterious reasons. That's a legitimate reason to be annoyed at you. I would hesitate to go on a trip with you in the future.", "You misunderstood OP just paid for the last one they were at that time. The following rooms would be more expensive, also all other cab rides to activities etc. It clearly affected her friends in multiple ways why else would they be this annoyed lol, OP being vague on this makes it quite obvious.", "Yep especially at this age where you dont have a lot of money. OP probably ruined the entire trip.", "Either that or they think you might not agree to come home. There is no chance I am going anywhere at all under those circumstances, even if i were at home. So, I definitely would not leave vacation.", "Depends on finances for me, personally. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford last minute international tickets. But if I were close enough to get there cheaply, I would cut my vacation short if my fam needed me.", "Yes it was payment for the last hotel of the trip", "OP did not have an explanation to give, they did not know why their parents wanted them home.", "You misunderstood. She paid her share for hotel X but not for the Y Z and Q that mightive followed. Also all cab rides just became more expensive etc.", "I mean depends on your parents and your relationship w them. I don\u2019t trust my dad and stepmom as far as I can throw them so in that case I\u2019d consider the thought process you mentioned and what I should\u2019ve said in my comment is that if my sister (someone I trust who does not make insane requests on the regular) did this - I\u2019d trust her judgement and go even if I was upset by the vagueness, because I trust her enough to assume that she was just freaking out and there was actually something serious going on. It sounds like OP trusts their parents judgement.", "OP, it\u2019s SO WEIRD that your parents would have you leave a trip without an explanation, and I bet your friends were weirded out too. It might\u2019ve sounded like you were trying to ditch them. And THEN they ended up with a much more expensive trip. You\u2019re NTA, but I see why they\u2019re mad/confused.", "I went NC with my dad as a teenager and went LC with my mom after my children were born, I wouldn't trust her if she told me the sky was blue...", "Bro if my dad told me water was wet I would never touch water again for fear he was somehow tracking me through the ocean.

Ive stayed in nearly every EU country except scandinavian ones and a few in africa and asia and you always prepay for your rooms. Atleast that was the case for the last 30 years...?", "We've had to give our credit card number to reserve but always pay upon checkout.  In fairness we've mostly been in Italy, Ireland, and France.  Apartments and B and B's in Italy and France do require advance payment--and the OP admits they were not paying in advance.", "ESH except your poor aunt (I hope she's ok). Your parents chose a bizarre way to communicate with you. Your friend should have let it go. \"Family emergency\" is a reason you tell your friends.", "I think it's funny when people use a throwaway for things like this, the people who were on the trip with you are going to know it's you.", "NTA. And he had no reason to complain unless he was afraid to travel without you.", "Yeah, the friend probably thought he'd done something to upset OP and felt upset that rather than talk to him about it she'd cancel a trip and hide the reason.\n\nPeople don't ask others to stop an expensive holiday and come home without giving reasons.", "It\u2019s not bizarre. Their mindset sounds somewhat similar to not giving people bad news while they\u2019re deployed (though obviously different in practice so don\u2019t @ me): when people are far away from home and they learn there\u2019s a crisis happening with their loved ones, panic/grief/irrational behavior/fear can easily take over along with feelings of complete powerlessness because they don\u2019t have their support system, they don\u2019t know if they can get back in time, etc. In this context, a young, panicked, upset female tourist in a foreign country becomes a much easier target than one who\u2019s just a bit confused and miffed about not knowing why they\u2019ve been called back home. \n\nBeyond that, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to read behind the lines. Obviously something bad has happened but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to know the severity until you\u2019re on the return flight.", "I'm an aunt, and if in the future my nephew leaves a Europe trip to come sit next to me at the hospital, I will be pissed!!! Especially if I've had a chronic disease.", "Exactly the OP is not an asshole but I don\u2019t get this at all. Parents won\u2019t say why? So weird. \n\nAnd then why come home. I\u2019m sorry but my grandmother had congestive heart failure for a long time. Meds would get it under control then not. If all of us had put our lives on hold for that, none of us would have done anything. \n\nPlus, the aunt is in a coma. You can\u2019t talk to her. She doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re there. And if she dies, funerals usually don\u2019t happen much faster that a week anyway. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to sound glib about her death, but people need to live their lives. If there was something her aunt needed and she could help, that\u2019s one thing. Otherwise, stopping your life to wait for someone to die is not necessary.\n\nIf this was a once in a lifetime trip I\u2019d go farther and say, the parents just shouldn\u2019t have told her at all, unless the aunt died.", "\ud83e\udd23Thanks grammar police", "I think your parents are a bit AHs. I think they should at least told you why you needed to come home.", "This! I genuinely don\u2019t think the parents wanted their young daughter traveling alone looking sad and vulnerable", "From OP:\n\n> I was able to pay my share for all the hotels we stayed in including the last one where it was only the 2 of them", "I get it completely!  Good luck to you!", "NTA. I can understand being disappointed that plans change, but your friend (22M) 'demanding' a reason is a bit dramatic for him. You paid your share for the hotels for the full 2 wks although you wouldn't be there to partake.  His response after being told that it was a family emergency/hospitalization is not only disingenuous but rude.", "how tf are there so many people here calling you the AH lol this blows my mind.\n\nYou're definitely NTA", "Yes that was what I said. The friends most likely felt OP was screwing them over since she was taking off and leaving them to pay more for their lodgings for the rest of the trip and with no explanation they may have felt she was leaving them in the lurch for no reason.   OP could/should have pressed the parents for an explanation.", ">The friend certainly is an asshole for his reaction to hearing your friends aunt is in a coma and will maybe die. \n\nAnd afterwards you say, \"my aunt is in a coma\" but your parents wouldn't tell you over the phone?\n\nI recognize it is true, but goddamn does it sound like a lie.", "Maybe I'm reading this wrong but it wasn't more expensive for them as OP gave them her portion of the payment for the last hotel that she wouldn't be at. OP is NTA nor does the friend have a leg to stand on for being angry. Disappointed, sure, but to react the way he did? He's the AH.", "NTA.\nMen often demand and feel entitled to judge if  a reason for something is valid. \nYour decisions which ultimately do not impact him/no massive impact do not require his permission or approval.\nYou did right by your friends as best you could given everything and that is that.\nLife is messy, emergencies happen and trips get cut short.", "Info: How was the trip going before you got this phone call? Also how did your other friend respond? The dynamics just seem really odd here. \n\nReading your post initially I got the vibe you were ok with leaving. It does sound like the \"parent call during a bad date demanding you get home by curfew\" move and that you were ready to take this excuse to leave.\n\nMaybe I'm totally off base here but if there was some tension it's possible your friend picked up on it and took you leaving personally.", "NTA.   You had to leave the trip because of a family emergency, and I guess you must be close to your aunt for them to have called you to come back home.  Your friend was taking this a lot harder than he needed to, since he could continue with the trip, which has me wondering \u2026 why?  Was there a chance that he wanted some development in the relationship with you, or that he didn\u2019t want to be left alone with your other friend for the remainder of the holiday?  I ask because his reaction seems far stronger than it needed, saying that it \u201cruined\u201d the trip.", "INFO\n\n> My aunt has a history of CHF, (congestive heart failure), and was currently in a coma.

If you grew up in some families, this would seem incredibly weird and unlikely.
