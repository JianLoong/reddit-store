If I were you, I would be scared to death about what is so urgent *and* secret.\n\nI can see how your friend could find this situation confusing. Doesn't mean he should have been an A H about it.", "NTA. Although I disagree with your parents not giving you a reason why over the phone.

Were you paying as you go and splitting the cost three ways? Or was the result of you pulling out with no warning going to mean that suddenly the trip you guys had agreed on together got way more expensive for your two friends?\n\nIf the cost was not going to change for them, then no biggie. If this was going to impact them in any way... then I can't blame them for being annoyed with the weird way you and your parents handled this. I mean, if they called and said, \"There is an emergency. THIS IS THE EMERGENCY. Please consider coming home now.\" then I think most people could understand that. But to not give any information, I think it would make it look to your friends like you were looking for any excuse to bail, and then just made up the thing about your aunt (who I hope is okay, btw.) \n\nSo I feel like all of you could have handled this better.", "NTA if you felt this was a valid reason to leave. I personally wouldn't budge for anyone without a concrete reason--even my parents.  However, \"family emergency\" is a valid reason.  You don't owe friends any more of a reason than that.", "Whew.

Sorry to hear about your aunt and I hope she is doing better.", "If I was in that situation and someone left a trip a week early without a reason, I'd think they just wanted to bail.

I personally also think its ridicilous to feel like a trip got ruined because one person has to leave but thats individual so i wont judge that comment. However demanding a reason because he supposedly deserves it and His reaction to the news make him an AH.

Yeah. Selfish and inconsiderate to ditch the friends who planned to split costs.", "They planned to split costs, OP fucked them over. The people you\u2019re on vacation with are somewhat entitled to an explanation if you leave in the middle of the trip - what if there\u2019s a danger they\u2019re unaware of?

And some news may not be the best for over the phone deliverance.\n\nI do think Ops friend had a right to be annoyed, but his further behavior is not acceptable. He was okay to ask for a reason, but when told the reason at a later date, he shouldn't be acting like a child over it.\n\nI do agree that OP should have been told at the very least it was a family emergency or something had happened. But it didn't end the trip for the friend, he still could have enjoyed himself. If he didn't that's his fault", "so if your friend\u2019s parents urged them to come home without a specific reason, you wouldn\u2019t be a a little concerned on what happened. you would just be worried about your trip being ruined", "I totally agree. \nYou\u2019re the AH for leaving a planned trip earlier without explanation.", "I disagree with that... I know my parents and if they called and told me to go to them without giving a reason I would be mortified that somebody is dying.

Not demanding an explanation. Would I be unhappy? Yes, definitely. But it all comes down to who your friends and family are. I trust their judgement, I trust their reasons and I know they aren't making some bull\\*\\*\\* excuse but it's something serious.

So you kind of screwed them over a bit with no explanation.  Mild YTA here but more your parents for making things so weird.  With paying more for hotels they had less for food and tourist attractions.  I can see where it ruined the trip to a certain extent and you definitely owe them an apology.", "absolutely incorrect. in another comment OP said all of the hotels were being paid for as they traveled around so OP had already paid for their share of where they were staying at the time. nobody had to pay any more than they already were.", "\u2018\u2019We had been paying as we go as none of the hotels had us prepay.
