However 22M was extremely upset. He kept asking for a reason on WHY I had to leave early and I kept telling him that my parents just insisted.

If I were you, I would be scared to death about what is so urgent *and* secret.\n\nI can see how your friend could find this situation confusing. Doesn't mean he should have been an A H about it.", "NTA. Although I disagree with your parents not giving you a reason why over the phone. I personally wouldn\u2019t of left my vacation until they did, but that\u2019s me. But this was a family emergency, and you friend is being insensitive of the situation and selfish. Hope your aunt is ok!!", "INFO: \n\nHow was payment for the trip arranged? Had you guys prepaid for hotels and other costs and were you still going to be covering your full share? Were you paying as you go and splitting the cost three ways? Or was the result of you pulling out with no warning going to mean that suddenly the trip you guys had agreed on together got way more expensive for your two friends?\n\nIf the cost was not going to change for them, then no biggie. If this was going to impact them in any way... then I can't blame them for being annoyed with the weird way you and your parents handled this. I mean, if they called and said, \"There is an emergency. THIS IS THE EMERGENCY. Please consider coming home now.\" then I think most people could understand that. But to not give any information, I think it would make it look to your friends like you were looking for any excuse to bail, and then just made up the thing about your aunt (who I hope is okay, btw.) \n\nSo I feel like all of you could have handled this better.", "NTA if you felt this was a valid reason to leave. I personally wouldn't budge for anyone without a concrete reason--even my parents.  However, \"family emergency\" is a valid reason.  You don't owe friends any more of a reason than that.", "Whew. Sounds like your friend wanted you there because he has a crush. Wouldn\u2019t work out anyway because he sounds like a real peach/s. \n\nNta. They could have broken a nail and all your friend needed to know was YOU CHOOSE to leave.", "INFO: Why wouldn't your parents tell you why?", "You are 100% NTA, but oof that 22M friend is top-level AH.", "NTA. It sounds like family comes first to you, and that's totally okay. If he's *not* okay with that and is going to make you feel bad about this, that's no friend.", "NTA, your friend doesn't seem like much of a friend to you however.  They seem like one of those friends who are good if they are always getting everything they want.", "NTA but your male friend is an asshat!!", "NTA. You need to get it across to your parents. It wasn't right to make you come home without knowing the reason. You should have known all the facts. Then it's your choice.", "NTA. Your friend is one though. What a selfish inconsiderate asshole.", "NTA - you had a family emergency, simple as that. If this was me Id have my parents at least give me some info though, Id worry more if they gave no info.", "NTA for prioritizing your family's needs over your vacation. Your friend sounds unreasonable. He could have continued to enjoy the vacation without you there. You also don't owe your friend any kind of explanation.", "Absolutely NTA. Sorry to hear about your aunt and I hope she is doing better.", "If I was in that situation and someone left a trip a week early without a reason, I'd think they just wanted to bail. Having someone leave early can put a damper on the trip for everyone else. I can understand why friend was upset. You parents should have told you the reason and let you decide what you felt you needed to do.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's a completely reasonable explanation. He probably was just upset because he's into you and the only reason he's on the trip is because you are there. If not, his reaction is kind of strange.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And no, OP doesnt have to give him a reason why she has to leave. And even then he got a reason, just didnt know in detail whats going on (which he also doesnt have a right of knowing), Just like OP. I personally also think its ridicilous to feel like a trip got ruined because one person has to leave but thats individual so i wont judge that comment. However demanding a reason because he supposedly deserves it and His reaction to the news make him an AH. OP knew the parents good enough to know that something is wrong and if thats reason enough for OP, so be it", "You're right his reaction to the reason was cold."]}
