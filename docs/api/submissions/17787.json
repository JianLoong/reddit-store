You have also depicted he was the chill dad. She has moodswings as well according to you.\n\nYTA Cause he knows his wife and she can be herself with him. Beeing family for such a long time the partnership and knowing eatchothers limits is the best. Sometimes adult children don't realise that they are kind of selfish and cross boundaries. If he said you have made her cry and he doesn't want you to do it again and you say that she doesn't cry and she's though..  Having a stroke is a big deal to adjust your body too. Sometimes people can't say \"stop, leave me alone\". Crying could be cause of need to rest.

Not hitting you but maybe throwing something near you? Emotional abuse. Screaming degrading someone ? Emotional abuse. It is every bit as damaging as physical or sexual violence but because the emotionally abused person has no bruises or marks people dismiss them [the abused] as being liars or over dramatic or it was \"just a couple having a rough patch\" or any number of things.
