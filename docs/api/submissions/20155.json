But it\u2019s also okay that she wants to go to the festival. \u201cThe first weekend of our lease\u201d isn\u2019t exactly an anniversary worthy event.

It\u2019s ok that she doesn\u2019t view move in weekend as some big life event but it\u2019s not okay if she expects you to do the heavy lifting.", "NAH.

It\u2019s one weekend, get over it.", "INFO\n\nDoes she expect you to do everything in the house and is there a deadline that she has to be COMPLETELY moved out?", "NAH\n\nListen this is just a difference in the way you're moving in together. To you, you want to spend the whole weekend together, creating memories immediately, and she likely views it as you now live together, the memories will be made whether she's there all weekend or not. \n\nI totally understand why you're feeling slighted, because you're excited, but I also get where she is coming from. She likely has been talking about this prior to signing the lease and having about two weeks between signing a lease and moving in is quite tight.", "INFO:  Does she go to this festival every year?", "YTA because of your attitude. \n\nNeither of your were unreasonable at first- but you insulting her and her interests pushed you into AH territory.", "INFO:\n\nDid you agree to spend the weekend before she bought the ticket?\n\nGonna say YTA, just communicate it next time.", "NAH\n\nBoth of your perspectives are valid and it sounds like there was a miscommunication somewhere. I really wouldn\u2019t make a big deal out of this.", "NTA, but you both need to work on your communication skills. It sucks that she'll be out of the house for your first weekend together, but it seems you weren't clear with her about your intentions for the weekend until she already had other plans. It isn't unreasonable to expect her to be home, especially so close to moving in, but it seems she's put her foot down. If you expect something from her, you have to communicate that. On the flip side, she needs to be more considerate of your shared time now that you live together.", "YTA - You are moving in on Tuesday, so the essential stuff will be done by the weekend. So this is just about you having an expectation of what that weekend would look like and being upset that she couldn't read your mind/didn't have the same vision for the weekend. The fact that you jumped right to calling her selfish and insulting her plans makes you the AH.\n\nYou need to learn how to communicate. TBH, it sounds like you guys have moved way to fast in moving in together. Make sure your relationship can last a year before financially committing to live together for that amount of time.", "ESH. She could be more mindful about the time you spend together especially in regards to this relationship milestone, but I also think you should communicate how important that time spent together is to you.", "Slight YTA - this isn't really a thing for everyone, and I think you're making it into a universal standard that doesn't exist. There isn't really \"first weekend in a new home\" memories to be built. You build those memories over time over the course of multiple weekends. \n\nIf I were you, I'd be more concerned about unpacking since a first weekend in a new place tends to be a lot of unpacking/cleaning/picking up household items tasks. But, that doesn't seem to be your concern. You seem more concerned with a fantasy of making memories versus her going to a festival she has historically attended. \n\nIt's a miscommunication and in my mind, not a deep one. You had an idea of something in your head that was not clearly communicated, assumed that it was a universal standard, and then got upset when it wasn't. IMO, you should just let it go.", "YTA. It is a small LOCAL festival which means that she will still be home. Your new home isn't a safehouse and y'all aren't mob informants. It is unreasonable to expect her to stay indoors all weekend.", "NAH, you want to spend it with her - but she doesn\u2019t want to spend it with you. I\u2019d personally be disappointed if my other half went away the first two days we are in a new place, but I don\u2019t think it makes her selfish - just with different priorities", "NTA- but this is a fine line because it could be something else...  1)you know what they say about assumptions... you made one.\n\n2)However, are you roommates or partners? If roommates, then yep, you straight up made an assumption for no good reason... but partners... well, part of being a partner means you are supposed to be able to assume that your partner wants to be with you for milestone stuff or has some general thoughts about your feelings. \n\nI think you have an interesting thing here. It could mean something or it could mean nothing. Maybe you like her more than she likes you?  Maybe she just isn't sentimental about things like \"first weekend together\".  However, the communication about this sucks from both sides. You accuse her of being selfish, she thinks you're unreasonable... how about y'all communicate better and assume less.", "YTA. If you expected her to be home for the weekend, you needed to COMMUNICATE that to her in advance. You can't just ASSume. Calling her selfish is what pushed you into AH territory. As you didn't communicate with her, your reaction is unwarranted. She's not being selfish - she can't read your mind.", "Slight YTA. She\u2019s not telepathic. You should really discuss these things before having these expectations.", "YTA. You're making assumptions, not communicating, and then lashing out when you don't get what you want. You're waving some red flags here.", "YTA. Seriously, you\u2019re adults with lives, don\u2019t make a big deal out of this.", "YTA\n\nShe has been going the last two years and changed her mind about going again this year.  Everyone knows what you mean by \"creating memories\" in our new home and her being \"selfish\".  Get over it, you have plenty of time to christen the new place.", "YTA.  My vote would have been N A H since it originally was just a difference in perspective in the importance of this weekend, but you crossed the line into TA territory when you decided to insult her and degrade an event she had a history of attending and presumably is looking forward to.  Not exactly creating positive memories for your first week in your new home together.", "NAH.\n\nYou both had different expectations and didn't communicate with each other.\n\nShe, apparently, doesn't think it is a \"small crappy annual festival\".  Don't voice that judgement to her.\n\nIf you're as compatible as you think you are, you will have lots of time to create many memories together.  First, learn to communicate better and don't just assume she wants to do what you're thinking.", "Nta you should be disappointed she's dumping all the moving in responsibilities on you and hanging with her friends. Can you delay moving in and just goto the festival?", "YTA, you\u2019re the only one being selfish and unreasonable.", "YTA -- While I totally understand the sentiment of wanting to spend your first weekend in your place together, life happens and not everything works out like a picturesque romantic movie. \n\nIts a local festival so its not like she will be far and you saying \"she would rather go to this small crappy annual festival\" is incredibly childish and makes you seem like a whiney, immature brat expecting her to only like what you like and live off of your schedule. \n\nIf you want something romantic, plan something for next weekend. \n\nWould you rather let the vibes in your house be warming and full of love while you support your partner or would you rather it be full of bitterness as you whine about how your partner is going to a \"crappy\" event with her friend?", "NTA, I understand your disappointment.", "I\u2019m really not sure what she expects, she ignored me after I said it was selfish of her", "She went the last 2 years but wasn\u2019t planning to go to this one until today", "I thought it was assumed that we would as we have a lot to do with moving in. I could understand her going for 1 day but to go the whole weekend feels unfair on me", "Yep", "\n>It sucks that she'll be out of the house for your first weekend together...It isn't unreasonable to expect her to be home, especially so close to moving in\n\nThis is utter nonsense. She will be home for their first weekend in their new house. The festival is local. OP's expectation is that she does not leave the house at all for the entire weekend.\n\n>she needs to be more considerate of your shared time now that you live together.\n\nOpposite. When living apart it takes more effort to carve out time together. Now that they live together, shared time is the default. They need to be more considerate of each other's individuality and interests.", "What\u2019s the best way to let it go after taking such a firm stand on it?", "She will be gone from 12pm to 2am (or later) both days. We weren\u2019t going to be indoors, there\u2019s plenty that we wanted to do outside in the new area right by the beach and theres a garden", "It makes me question moving in together if she\u2019s a bigger priority to me than I am to her", "We\u2019re partners. She\u2019s talked a lot about how excited she is to move in with me and have talked about all the things we want to do when we get there. But yes you and everyone else are correct that I shouldn\u2019t have assumed we would be doing any of these things on our first weekend", "She told me last week she wasn\u2019t bothered about going to this festival then suddenly the day after we get our move in date she has decided to go", "LOL well yeah.  That was pretty rude.  Her wanting to go is not selfish.", "It's a local festival, local. That means she's not going to be out of town. What are you crying about?", "\u201cUnfair on me.\u201d\n\nThis seems childish and and overreaction. You never made plans. You are going to be spending day and night together for at least 12 months. I don\u2019t understand what is so special about this weekend that\u2019s not going to be the same as every weekend. You didn\u2019t get married or have a child. It\u2019s a new apartment. \n\nYTA for assuming and then being hurt about her not reading your mind.", ">I thought it was assumed that we would as we have a lot to do with moving in.\n\nWhen you assume. You make an ass out of u and me.\n\nAssumptions are the mother of all \\*\\*\\*\\* ups.\n\nAlso I re-read the post again. \n\n>this small crappy annual festival.\n\nWay to show passion in your partners interests... If you said this too them then 100% YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook at it this way. YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIVES TO SPEND TOGETHER. \n\nI get moving into a new place is exciting and a big step but seriously, its not that deep.", "That doesn\u2019t change the fact that you acted like TA by calling her selfish and saying the festival is \u201ccrappy\u201d just because you and she had different views on the importance of spending the first weekend together.", "I\u2019ve never lived with her or any partner before, it\u2019s a big deal to me"]}
