{"id": 3586, "submission_id": "z8qai3", "title": "AITA for refusing to offer my spare room to my cousin, who was recently kicked out of her parents' home for being gay?", "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nRebecca (32F) recently came out to her mother (50s or 60s F), and it didn't go well. Her mother harbours strong homophobic beliefs, so I (30M) wasn't surprised that she reacted poorly. I was surprised, however, at how badly her mother took the news. To make a long story short: her mother kicked Rebecca out, and all but disowned her.\n\nThis happened last Saturday.\n\n**The dispute:**\n\nThis afternoon Rebecca called me to ask if she could stay in my guest room until she figures her situation out. I spent the day mulling it over, but ultimately decided to decline the request.\n\nHere's a summary of why:\n\n* I'm not close to Rebecca. In fact, if anything, we have somewhat of a strained relationship. As we were rather close to age we were often pitted against each other in terms of achievements and progress by various members of our extended family. As I grew up I mellowed out, content to live life on my own terms. Rebecca, however, always took every opportunity to tear me down. Her latest slew of attacks against me involved her demeaning my job, and claiming that my job added no value to society.\n* I have no faith that Rebecca will figure anything out within anything remotely resembling a reasonable timeframe. She's not exactly a functional adult. She's on her third degree after dropping out of her first two. She can't hold down a job, even the simplest part-time ones. As far as I am aware, she's been unemployed for almost two years at this point. Rebecca has relied entirely on her parents for almost every facet of her life, be it having meals cooked for her, the cleaning and ironing of her clothes, everything. Rebecca is very much a child despite her age.\n* I'm not Rebecca's only option. Several of my cousins have their own places, even if they're just renting. Rebecca can go stay at theirs until she figures her situation out. And, unlike me, my cousins actually have a relationship with Rebecca, and think fondly of her.\n\n**The fallout:**\n\nWhile I didn't expect Rebecca to be happy with my decision, I didn't anticipate her blowing up at me either. She called me selfish, took family for granted, and even attempted to label me as a homophobic. Like I said above, I was never that fond of Rebecca, so her words did not bother me all too much.\n\nWhat did hurt me were the words of some of my other cousins, who I do care about, also accusing me of being inconsiderate. They say that as I'm the only one of my cousins who own my own place, and that I have an unused room, I should be offering that room to Rebecca. I don't know. Should I? How much do you owe family, even if you don't like that family?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669811441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8qai3/aita_for_refusing_to_offer_my_spare_room_to_my/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given your other cousins are focusing on the fact that you should take her on becuase you own your home and Rebecca's total lack of life skills, I wonder if you would ever get her to leave??\nIt gives the other cousins a very easy out with no care for you which is disappointing.

I also don't agree that Amy kind of agreement, written or otherwise, would get her to stick to that agreement. Cause how will you be able to enforce it when she's in already.

Then she would be almost impossible to evict. That's why OP is smart to avoid the situation.", "You realize she's 32, not a teenager/young adult right? \n\n> In regards to the second bullet point, surely the fact that you don\u2019t have faith that she\u2019ll figure something out fast would make you MORE willing to take her in not less? \n\nThat's absolutely a reason not to take her in. There's no end date in sight and most wouldn't want to be responsible for a grown adult who's made poor life decisions.", "Why does OP suck for not taking in a 32-year-old who was still living at home? \n\nNTA.", "Loving is entirely different than opening your home to someone you don't feel would be a good house guest.", "Right! She is accustomed to doing absolutely NO adulting. Hasn't worked in two years. \n\nWhomever takes her in will need a whole skateboard, helmet, stick of dynamite Looney Tunes ACME kit to get her out their house\ud83e\udd23", "I mean, honestly, they may have been looking for a reason to kick her out. She handed it to them. \n\nLike, it\u2019s horrible to feel forced to stay in the closet and not live your true self. BUT when you are 32, unemployed, and completely unable or unwilling to even prepare your own food\u2026you maybe should consider if THAT will be the straw that breaks the camels back. *I* would have asked her to leave about 10 years earlier if she contributed nothing to the household, so I can kind of see why they latched on to any excuse to evict her. Even OP seems surprised that they kicked her out for it, so they may have taken this gift and run with it.", "A permanent guest because I would not expect a guest to clean my house or cook meals or contribute to my bills. So yes, she would be a guest. A permanent guest that needs taking care of", "They\u2019re basically agreeing to adopt a 32 Year old child.\nHard pass.\nI feel for anyone who gets this reaction from their parents but this woman should very much already be supporting herself. NTA.\n\nSorry gut this woman had 14 years to get herself settled and find her own means of supporting herself.\nYes parental rejection hurts no matter what but this specific issue shouldn\u2019t really be an issue at this stage in her life.", "You don\u2019t have to tear yourself down as stupid just because you don\u2019t know a random term", "From what I've heard in the community bi-gay is bi but has a strong preference towards guys. Again I might be wrong, so I'll leave it to the orig commenter. But mostly commenting to come back to it and possibly learn more too! \ud83d\udc9c", "Not insensitive. Just that I am bi on one form of attraction but gay on another.\n\nThere\u2019s physical, sexual and romantic attraction. I\u2019m Bi on Physical and romantic (I\u2019d date both men and women) but sex I\u2019d probably only have with men (few exceptions).\n\nAnd you\u2019re not stupid, even after 8 years of identity discovery I only learnt the term like 4 months ago", "True", "I meant strong preference to the same gender as them sorry!!"]}
