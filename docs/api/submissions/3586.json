{"id": 3586, "submission_id": "z8qai3", "title": "AITA for refusing to offer my spare room to my cousin, who was recently kicked out of her parents' home for being gay?", "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nRebecca (32F) recently came out to her mother (50s or 60s F), and it didn't go well. Her mother harbours strong homophobic beliefs, so I (30M) wasn't surprised that she reacted poorly. I was surprised, however, at how badly her mother took the news. To make a long story short: her mother kicked Rebecca out, and all but disowned her.\n\nThis happened last Saturday.\n\n**The dispute:**\n\nThis afternoon Rebecca called me to ask if she could stay in my guest room until she figures her situation out. I spent the day mulling it over, but ultimately decided to decline the request.\n\nHere's a summary of why:\n\n* I'm not close to Rebecca. In fact, if anything, we have somewhat of a strained relationship. As we were rather close to age we were often pitted against each other in terms of achievements and progress by various members of our extended family. As I grew up I mellowed out, content to live life on my own terms. Rebecca, however, always took every opportunity to tear me down. Her latest slew of attacks against me involved her demeaning my job, and claiming that my job added no value to society.\n* I have no faith that Rebecca will figure anything out within anything remotely resembling a reasonable timeframe. She's not exactly a functional adult. She's on her third degree after dropping out of her first two. She can't hold down a job, even the simplest part-time ones. As far as I am aware, she's been unemployed for almost two years at this point. Rebecca has relied entirely on her parents for almost every facet of her life, be it having meals cooked for her, the cleaning and ironing of her clothes, everything. Rebecca is very much a child despite her age.\n* I'm not Rebecca's only option. Several of my cousins have their own places, even if they're just renting. Rebecca can go stay at theirs until she figures her situation out. And, unlike me, my cousins actually have a relationship with Rebecca, and think fondly of her.\n\n**The fallout:**\n\nWhile I didn't expect Rebecca to be happy with my decision, I didn't anticipate her blowing up at me either. She called me selfish, took family for granted, and even attempted to label me as a homophobic. Like I said above, I was never that fond of Rebecca, so her words did not bother me all too much.\n\nWhat did hurt me were the words of some of my other cousins, who I do care about, also accusing me of being inconsiderate. They say that as I'm the only one of my cousins who own my own place, and that I have an unused room, I should be offering that room to Rebecca. I don't know. Should I? How much do you owe family, even if you don't like that family?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669811441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8qai3/aita_for_refusing_to_offer_my_spare_room_to_my/", "score": 895, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also don't agree that Amy kind of agreement, written or otherwise, would get her to stick to that agreement. Cause how will you be able to enforce it when she's in already.

Unemployed for the last two years is rough.", "Houseguest is the wrong term.  Overgrown toddler is the right term.  Her cousins don't want an overgrown toddler living with them so they are trying to pawn Rebecca off on OP.", "Plus, given her first response to OP refusing to house her is to accuse him of homophobia, I'm not even sure that what she says is the reason she got kicked out is true either.", "Absolutely. A houseguest who expects to be waited on hand and foot since she essentially still needs to be raised like a child. The request is for a lot more than temporary boarding. NTA", "Not even a house guest. They\u2019ll have an adult child, whose gonna be expected to take up the mantle of mommy and daddy who cook for her and cover her financially. \n\nHard pass indeed.", "You know there was a global Pandemic and a recession? \nA Lot of people had to move back to their family.", "Exactly.  Not a roommate.  A roommate takes care of themselves and does 1/2 the chores.  Rebecca will do neither.", "When OP said his cousin was kicked out I was expecting like 16-18 year old range. Not a 30-year old woman.", "The woman is 32 years old and still living with mommy and daddy and can't even hold down a part time job. They know what they're in for if they take her in. They're just mad OP isn't a total sucker.

People just love to be generous with someone else's money/property.", "Maybe OP should be the first to say: no thanks, I\u2019ll pass.", "I tend to think that the LGBT stuff is irrelevant here.  It is a condition that caused her need, but it is not the cause for OP's denial of meeting that need.  \n\nOP is being perfectly reasonable in saying no to Rebecca.  Living with someone requires a relationship with level of trust and respect that she and Rebecca do not share.  While being sensitive to the fact that Rebecca just came out is important, it does not alter the fact that OP and Rebecca do not have the established relationship that would make living together even a moderately ok idea.", "Pretty sure 90% of the reason her parents kicked her out was because she is a leech, and if you are a leech, bring who you are (a leech) is a solid reason to get kicked out", "If OP decides to be charitable and give her a chance, I wonder if they'd perhaps consider an alternative to financial contibution for a set amount of time. Ex: Rebecca does all the cooking and cleaning (and other tasks to maintain a household) until x-date by which she needs to have a job (or a student loan?) to be able to contribute financially. That way it would give her a bit of leeway, because obviously as of this current moment she probably doesn't have a job and needs a bit of time to find out.\n\nIf OP chooses to be charitable.", "None of this make OP an AH, OP has no obligation to provide her with anything.", "OP is not required to set herself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "The second bullet point is referencing the fact that she\u2019ll probably mooch of OP for decades just like she was doing at her previous living situation. OP has the right to want a peaceful life without worrying about another human being for years or decades", "No, you're not.", "My first thoughts reading the title were how could someone be so cruel to a homeless teen. Saw the age and I knew it would be a NTA.", "Yeah, from the title I was expecting a naive 15yo who had a reasonable expectation that their parents would continue providing for them and with nowhere else to go and no way of reasonably supporting themselves. This is a grown woman who has never been self-sufficient in the 14 years since she legally became an adult. She's also old enough to know that coming out to her homophobic mother would result in her getting kicked out of the house, so the fact that she did so without having an exit strategy in place is suspect. \n\nI say this as someone who didn't realize she was queer until her 30s (and was still in school at the time), it is not homophobic to not take her in. NTA", "I was fully expecting someone younger than 20 based on the title, lol", "a 32 year old claiming ops job adds no value to society yet her whole existence probably adds no value to society.", "Put up or shut up \nNTA", "I thought the same.", "I was questioning it even before the cousins\u2019 comments.", "That doesn\u2019t shock me. There have been dozens of posts here where the OP was called a homophobe because they refused a reasonable boundary by a gay person in their life.", "Yes - the cousin seemed to have a life plan of living at home until her parents die and then inherit the house.  How can you transplant that lifestyle to someone else?", "Boom!", "Yes - this is always the unspoken part of situations like this.  Anyone offering criticism is welcome to step up and be Rebecca's new mommy & daddy.", "I understand the spirit of what you're saying, but I don't think it makes the mom sound as reasonable as you may have thought it did. \n\nAt that point she's just pretending to be homophobic instead of simply being honest with her daughter about needing to move out.", "\u201cRebecca is an AH, who just so happened to be LGBT\u201d \n\nand \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of supporting LGBT people\u2026 But Rebecca has seemingly done little to earn such aid\u201d", "I think it might be relevant in another situation where OP was on the fence, just not in this case", "You aren't dumb.
