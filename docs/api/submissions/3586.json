{"id": 3586, "submission_id": "z8qai3", "title": "AITA for refusing to offer my spare room to my cousin, who was recently kicked out of her parents' home for being gay?", "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nRebecca (32F) recently came out to her mother (50s or 60s F), and it didn't go well. Her mother harbours strong homophobic beliefs, so I (30M) wasn't surprised that she reacted poorly. I was surprised, however, at how badly her mother took the news. To make a long story short: her mother kicked Rebecca out, and all but disowned her.\n\nThis happened last Saturday.\n\n**The dispute:**\n\nThis afternoon Rebecca called me to ask if she could stay in my guest room until she figures her situation out. I spent the day mulling it over, but ultimately decided to decline the request.\n\nHere's a summary of why:\n\n* I'm not close to Rebecca. In fact, if anything, we have somewhat of a strained relationship. As we were rather close to age we were often pitted against each other in terms of achievements and progress by various members of our extended family. As I grew up I mellowed out, content to live life on my own terms. Rebecca, however, always took every opportunity to tear me down. Her latest slew of attacks against me involved her demeaning my job, and claiming that my job added no value to society.\n* I have no faith that Rebecca will figure anything out within anything remotely resembling a reasonable timeframe. She's not exactly a functional adult. She's on her third degree after dropping out of her first two. She can't hold down a job, even the simplest part-time ones. As far as I am aware, she's been unemployed for almost two years at this point. Rebecca has relied entirely on her parents for almost every facet of her life, be it having meals cooked for her, the cleaning and ironing of her clothes, everything. Rebecca is very much a child despite her age.\n* I'm not Rebecca's only option. Several of my cousins have their own places, even if they're just renting. Rebecca can go stay at theirs until she figures her situation out. And, unlike me, my cousins actually have a relationship with Rebecca, and think fondly of her.\n\n**The fallout:**\n\nWhile I didn't expect Rebecca to be happy with my decision, I didn't anticipate her blowing up at me either. She called me selfish, took family for granted, and even attempted to label me as a homophobic. Like I said above, I was never that fond of Rebecca, so her words did not bother me all too much.\n\nWhat did hurt me were the words of some of my other cousins, who I do care about, also accusing me of being inconsiderate. They say that as I'm the only one of my cousins who own my own place, and that I have an unused room, I should be offering that room to Rebecca. I don't know. Should I? How much do you owe family, even if you don't like that family?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669811441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8qai3/aita_for_refusing_to_offer_my_spare_room_to_my/", "score": 3070, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also don't agree that Amy kind of agreement, written or otherwise, would get her to stick to that agreement. Cause how will you be able to enforce it when she's in already.

Cousins mom has probably looking for an excuse to kick her out for a decade!", "Very fucking likely. \n\nGranted, OP said they were known to be homophobic, but to my mind, that means you get your shit in order BEFORE coming out. ESPECIALLY when you contribute nothing to the household and are in your 30s.", "Wouldn't that mean your a picky pansexual who doesn't want to be in a monogamous relationship? That doesn't sound too complicated... your sexuality is pan, or bi if you wanna differentiate it between sex instead of gender. Being very picky is not really about sexuality, nor are your views on monogamy. Being a geek or a gamer are hobbies and those have nothing to do with your sexual orientation.", "NTA. She\u2019s 32 and was still living at home, unemployed and not even helping out around the house?? You were right to tell her no. You\u2019d never get rid of her if she moved in", "Absolutely agree!  This girl - sorry, grown 32yr old woman - has been unpleasant, rude, belittling and obnoxious to NTA for years.  Really, she has more neck than a giraffe (hope this British idiom work in the US!) to even ASK!  Do NOT feel guilty for saying \"No\"!  Congratulate yourself for not caving in to familial pressure when your cousin appears to be a set of really poor choices and lack of awareness on legs.  Don't let her through the door!  \n\nYou could, just to encourage a little reflection, ask her why she thought her appalling behaviour towards you over the years would make this request appropriate, let alone likely to get a her a place to live!"]}
