If they'd reached out to say that they were having issues you could have extended them some grace, but without any communication you were doing the best thing with the information you hade (that you paid and had been ghosted).  \nYes, there are times when your mental health makes it difficult to reach out, but in a professional situation a simple \"I am currently in poor health and will reach out as soon as I am able\" goes a long way.", "NTA you couldn\u2019t have known they were having mental health issues.  Anybody else would have thought they were being scammed.  Sorry they are having mental health problems but refund your money or deliver the pictures.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you signed a contract, they have already breeched it by going way beyond the initial timeline to provide the photos. You reached out multiple times and they kept giving dates then not meeting them.", "NTA - I would reply and let them know the letter is coming, that you were concerned since you hadn\u2019t heard from them. You can feel bad about being direct, but that isn\u2019t your fault. They didn\u2019t communicate and these pics are far more important to you than they are to them.", "Former wedding photographer here. NTA I don't care what their excuses are, they should have kept an open line of communication with you. The proofs should have been available within 2 weeks maximum! Proofs are so small that you don't even need to do the full amount of editing. Three or four fully edited sneak peek pictures within a couple days, the lightly edited proofs within two weeks max and then they would fully edit the ones you order, and the ones they want for their portfolio....2 more weeks maybe. \n\nI used to edit entire weddings and it took 4 hours a night for 2 weeks straight. So while you're adding weddings every week end, it's pushing everybody back to the 6 to 8 weeks that they originally mentioned to you. That's the hard way but that's the way some do it so whatever.\n\nI don't believe their mental health issue though. And I have no reason for that, but I just think they're overwhelmed... Because it gets overwhelming... But they don't get to just not edit your wedding. They were paid for the job, and if you have to force them by legal means to give you what you paid for then go for it! You've been more than patient!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't know about his personal issues and even if he's going through a hard time, he could at least have sent you a message to warn you and keep it professional.", "NTA. Maybe they should of be honest and up front about their issues from the beginning. It *may* of given them a little more grace under the circumstances. But their mental issues doesn\u2019t negate the terms of the contract signed. And they ignored and lied to you over and over again.", "NTA \n\n1) A contract is a contact. If you were really stressed from the wedding, could you 'forget' to pay her, no you couldn't.\n\n2) There is a good chance that she only told you that to be manipulative. She said that to make you feel bad/guilty. She could have communicated delays better too.", "NTA. If the photographer couldn't cope they shouldn't have taken the job.", "NTA\n\nTheir mental health issues, while regrettable and relatable, do not negate the terms of your agreement.", "NTA- as someone with mental health issues myself it's not an excuse to delay your photographs by months without even giving you a heads up or proper notification of a delay. You've been given so many excuses and empty promises that I'd just take this as another excuse. They may not even have any mental health issues and may be using that as yet another excuse.", "NTA.  His mental health issues are not your problem.  You paid for a service and it's very late.", "NTA. Try to get the raw photos.", "NTA. Health issues are unfortunate, but they're running a business and should have contingencies.\n\nThey could have sent you the raw files and a partial refund for the editing. They could have outsourced the editing to someone else. They could have just said \"hey sorry ive had some health issues and there's a delay, I need another month or so\", you sound pretty understanding. It would have at least been contact.\n\nMost photographers get paid in advance, so if they've taken your money, they can either provide the service or refund you. Presumably, there's a point in the 6-8 weeks where you know you're behind schedule and can inform the client.", "NTA.\n\nDudette, \"mental issues\" are the new catchphrase to get out of doing something/make excuses for why something is not done. You paid the photographer the money, you had an agreement. They must honor it, or get sued.", "NTA. A job is a job. Frankly it\u2019s pretty unprofessional that they told you about their personal issues.", "NTA - I\u2019m a wedding photographer, and had seen a few photographers doing this. They take more wedding that they could handle, and they are burning out and cannot mange to keep themselves to deadlines. I get that it\u2019s mentally hard for them but it\u2019s their responibility to keep themselvs to the contracts they signed.If they can\u2019t keep up with the deadlines they could hire someone to do the editing\u2026 but they clearly don\u2019t give a shit about delivering your photos as soon as possible. It would be the minimum of them to communicate better. It\u2019s really bothering me because it\u2019s a really  unprofessional behavior\u2026 \nYou waited way more than you signed up for, so don\u2019t feel bad for that letter. And please don\u2019t let them not to deliver your photos!", "NTA - the no response triggered the letter. You had no idea (if it\u2019s even true) about said issues.  No reason for you to fret over it.", "Omg we had this same issue with ours--and the same excuse! You already paid them and they violated their contract with you--so demand away. NTA", "NTA. You have a contract. Photographer didn\u2019t explain the reason for the delay before the deadline. But, even had the photographer explained the reason, the contract sets out the terms and he/she should\u2019ve offered something for the delay - extra photos, money back, etc.", "NTA. Whatever issues they have, should remain private. They're professionals, they should act like it.", "NTA, I don\u2019t know anyone that doesn\u2019t have mental health issues \u2014 severe ones at that \u2014 yet we all have to pull through and function and complete our commitments/jobs.", "NTA. If they can\u2019t live up to their commitments then they should have informed you as a client immediately.", "NTA, but why risk anoying him?

And with compensation to you.", "Ask him for the raw files", "NTA. The photos have been taken. If the photog couldn't deal they could have hired someone to help edit the photos. They could have been transparent. You have to do what you have to do. I would demand the raw photos, or take them to small claims.", "NTA. Did their mental health problems preclude them from cashing your deposit check?", "NTA. If they wanted more patience, maybe they should have been more honest from the start.

I think NAH; if the photographer was too ill to get in contact with OP, they\u2019re not being an AH. But also, with no available info, the OP wasn\u2019t an AH to react as they did.\n\nI do think that now the OP knows what happened, they should warn the photographer about the letter and let them know that they understand about the delay.", "Also, you can give her a heads-up about the letter of you think she called before receiving it.", "Yeah no, I\u2019m sorry but mental health is no excuse to just completely ignore your client, especially when you have dates set via contract to have the end product. And when the end product is something as important and personal as wedding photos. As someone who struggles with mental health a fair amount, they should\u2019ve reached out sooner to say they were struggling instead of just disappearing and leaving OP clueless. The photos are 3 months behind at this point with little to no communication. The fact OP had to get a lawyer involved at all is unacceptable. Mental health struggles or not, that\u2019s not how you run your business. It\u2019s your responsibility to keep up with your workload and/or communication with your client. NTA OP", "They could hire someone else to do the editing. It\u2019s a common thing.
