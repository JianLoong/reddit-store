Really point 1 is enough to sway the judgement your way, since if she didn't communicate she has no right to be upset that you are doing separate things. \n\nBUT You have a right to your vacation choice anyway.

I camped there once about 15 years ago for a friends birthday. It was absolutely beautiful, and I have recommended it to many people. However, camping on the beach is only fun until you go to sleep night one.. then you wake up and realize the sand is now everywhere and this is life now. We had a like 3 hour car ride back home after, and it was just miserable. Nothing packed back up as well as it was for the drive down, so the car was more cramped, and being constantly covered in a fine layer of sand for 24 hours was very itchy. Can't fault you at all for not wanting to do that.", "Vacations are meant to recharge your batteries. Relax so you can face the doom that is your job. You want to write and not sleep on the ground. She wants to rough it. She should have discussed it with you beforehand. You could have gone glamping if she insisted on camping. Nature can be inspiring. NTA and it sounded horrible.", "NTA \n\nYour vacation has to work for you; camping and bad backs just don't work", "How do people think camping is vacation and not torture? NTA.", "NTA.  You and she have widely differing versions of 'vacation'.   You will not enjoy what she's planned.  And she'll have her mom and sister with her.", "This is nonsense. Why would you want to go on a vacation and do something you don't want to do... in fact even that you HATE doing? Even if it's free?\n\nPersonally, for me I wouldn't even go on that vacation If you PAID me to.\n\nThere is absolutely no upside to going on this friend's vacation. She needs to let it go.\n\nGo on the trip that you want to go on, and have a blast..\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \nIdk why she is upset, she booked this trip and is surprised you won't drop everything to go? She isn't going alone, she has her sis and mom, but it's also her own fault for not communicating with you. You mentioned how if there was a way for you to compromise but how can you when you have zero idea she was planning a group trip? \n\nI've learned the hard way that even though you can be wonderful friends does not mean you are great travel companions. \n\nI went on a trip with a group of 5, 2 I've travelled with and 2 new people, 1 of the girls was the worst but she keeps thinking it was an amazing trip and we need to do another one again when 4 of us collectively agreed to never travel with her again due to the stress she brought. Still friends just refuse to travel. I've also heard stories of ppl ending friendships over a trip.\n\nSo enjoy your vacation. If she wants to end your friendship over this then oh well.", "NTA that you didn\u2019t like her vacation.", "NTA but buried in this petulance is that your friend would like to actively plan a vacation with you like you used to.", "NTA well, you can't read her mind. She is already traveling with family, why should you go, too? To be the 5th wheel? To feel miserable because this isn't your type of vacation? You don't have to ask permission to go on your own holiday.\n\nYou could also be pissed at her? Why didn't she ask to accompany you? It's easy for her to guilt you into believing that you made a mistake. If it was that important for her that you take your vacation together, she would have talked to you about it much earlier, asked about ideas for locations and a budget. She didn't do anything if this.\n\nEnjoy your holiday!", "Dude, it could be the last chance I have to see my best friend ever and I wouldn't go with them on your friend's idea of a \"vacation\" lol. Not everyone has the same taste and your friend needs to deal with that. NTA.", "NTA for very good reasons.  I cannot believe she has disregarded your physical issues like this - if you are that close she obviously knows about them.  Please let it go & enjoy your vacation.", "This is absolutely what I was feeling guilty over. You are correct. I didn\u2019t even sit down or call her, or anything, to try to discuss a compromise. She just seemed so deadset on this beach thing that I didn\u2019t even consider offering to find a way to be there too. I could have rented a room nearby and hung out with them during the day.", ">But you didn't even try to talk to her about changing her plans so that you both were comfortable going somewhere\n\n\nWhy should she do that? \n\n\nAnd please, Op worked 4 years for this vacation. She should really vacation as she likes."]}
