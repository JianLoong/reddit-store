{"id": 22028, "submission_id": "14xnu32", "title": "AITA for asking my partner not to wear a harness to meet my work colleagues?", "selftext": "One night my partner and I had plans to attend a pride party in the city. I had also made plans the same evening to grab drinks with my work colleagues. I work in a formal environment, surrounded by a majority of conservative people. i've been working there for two years, this was the first time I agreed to an invitation to go for drinks with colleagues my age. Nothing bad about them, they're just not my crowd. \n\nMy partner mentioned several times that i don't introduce her to work colleagues. While this is accurate, it comes form my lack of active social involvement rather than any deliberate exclusion. I hardly ever go to post-work social events or gatherings. However. t he drinks that night seemed like the perfect opportunity to introduce her and have a drink before heading to the event.\n\nWhile getting ready, my partner tried on a harness over her t-shirt and asked for my opinion (It was a fake leather harness with metal details). Initially, I thought she was joking, but when I realized she wasn't, I politely said that perhaps the harness might not be suitable for meeting my work colleagues. Her response was abrupt - she left the room without a word. Later, she returned to tell me to go to the drinks alone and that we'd meet at the party later. Her reaction took me by surprise as I didn't think my request was unreasonable. Deciding to let it pass, I left to meet my colleagues.\n\nLater that night we met up at the party venue and had the biggest argument we've ever had since we got together 8 years ago.\n\nThe core of my partner's argument was this: She felt I had not supported her in her desire to express herself. All her life she had conformed to societal expectations of how a woman should dress and behave. My request for her not to wear the harness was representative of me conforming with patriarchal norms. She said I was uncomfortable because I couldn't fully be myself around my work colleagues, that I cared too much about their opinions, and I shouldn't. After all, a harness is just an accessory, not necessarily kinky at all.\n\nFrom my perspective, this argument was not about feminism. I was baffled that I had to justify to my partner of 8 years why wearing a harness for the first time meeting with my work colleagues might be inappropriate. I felt we did not live in a shared reality. Couldn't she see how it could make me uncomfortable? Why did her disappointment over my perceived lack of support override the reality of our social setting? couldn't she see that i am the one who bears the consequences of that choice, or did she simply disregard my feelings about it?\n\nIt has been a month since this argument. Since then she brought our argument up when talking about feminism. In her view, my defensiveness towards her accusing me of conforming with patriarchal norms comes from my tendency to distance myself form hypermasculinity, and not because I actually think I did nothing wrong.", "created_utc": 1689166552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xnu32/aita_for_asking_my_partner_not_to_wear_a_harness/", "score": 743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, we don't live in such a world, and there are moments when we must weigh the risks and rewards of such bold expression moment to moment. The professional world and kink world (whether or not she meant it that way, some people may perceive the harness as a kink item) typically don't mix, and you're right to be mindful about how this would impact your standing in this social sphere. Ultimately, your income and future prospects are extremely important, and challenging the patriarchy through fashion in front of colleagues just isn't worth it in that moment.\n\nI was always taught to have boundaries between my private and professional life. I will never lie to anyone about having a wonderful girlfriend (lesbian relationship here) unless our immediate safety is on the line, but I'm also not going to share our interests in the bedroom with my colleagues. When we do appear together in front of people I work with or who may be relevant later, we also don't cuddle like lovelorn teenagers. I can't imagine this is considered professional among straight couples either. Having such boundaries is just the realistic price of maintaining a favorable image in my field.\n\nMy work is also my passion, so maintaining a professional image within that realm is crucial to me on multiple levels. Whether your work is also your passion or just your source of financial security, she should show some empathy towards you in this situation. Then go on a date to a nice restaurant and embrace scandalizing some pearl-clutchers with your patriarchy-smashing style.\n\nWe don't always agree with our partners on everything, but, because we love them, we should remain open to compromise.

It is ok, and somewhat expected, to dress for the occasion. Drinks with colleagues your partner has never met is not the time for leather-wear suitable for a party. It's also ok that you can't \"be yourself\" around colleagues. Frankly, who wants to be? The people you work with don't need to know the depths of your life, personality, style, opinions, etc. They only need to know you to the extent your professional rapport necessitates -- this will be different for everyone depending on your field and position. I work in a field that functions on out-of-office engagement: building connections over drinks, attending events (from parties to conferneces), traveling domestically and abroad. Some (*some*) colleagues will know more about me and have a higher level of comfort with me than if I worked in a more rigid setting. \n\nIt sounds like your workplace is formal and any engagement with your co-workers will, understandably, fit that model. You also mentioned feeling no particular affinity toward your colleagues. You're correct that your partner is not taking any of this into account and is also not consider your feelings or how your professional life will be affected by her personal decisions. This isn't a matter of style, expression, or utilizing feminism in the face of patriarchy. Additionally, strapping on your best leather gear (a style of expression I'm rather fond of \ud83d\ude09) isn't going to undo the aesthetic codes that have been imposed on Western work life. In addition to the things noted in your post, your partner needs to be reminded that there's a time and place for everything and that every moment isn't a fight against \"the norm\" or a reconciliation of trauma.

All of that culminates to: you already don\u2019t feel secure with them.\n\nI see why your partner is upset, but their fashion at a singular event/occasion does not innately have more worth than your comfort and security at work.

While kink absolutely has a place at pride, drinks with your colleagues was not a pride event. It was a professional networking event, and because of that there's decorum. Even if it was casual, it was still meeting people you work with. These aren't friends, their professional acquaintances, and things like that can have an effect on your career. It's unfortunate that that's the case, but it absolutely is, and will be for a long time, unless a whole lot of people get cool with a whole lot of stuff quick. \n\nLike, if she wants to be angry about this, that's her hill to die on. But at the end of the day we still exist and have to work in a society where if someone shows up to a non kink event in a harness, people are gonna judge. If it's a work event, it's real easy to just not do that. Your partner needs to have more consideration for your day to day professional life in this case. Like others have said, you didn't say to not where the harness that night, just not to that event in particular. \n\nIf it's been a month and it's still an issue, maybe try a session of couples counselling.

I\u2019m a feminist and am well aware of the sexist standards women are held to in terms of dress, particular in workplace settings. I don\u2019t believe a partner has the right to dictate how the other dresses. However- that doesn\u2019t give someone free reign to just do whatever they want when the comfort of others are involved. There are still levels of appropriateness depending on context. You weren\u2019t asking her to wear a business suit, heels, and a full set of makeup and sacrifice her own comfort for the sake of impressing your coworkers. You were asking her to not wear an accessory unnecessary for the setting that very well may raise eyebrows with people she is meeting for the first time, who you have to see on a regular basis. Yes, ideally we should all be able to wear whatever the hell we want and not be judged- but that\u2019s not reality. And while she is welcome to take on that judgement however she wants when it only affects her, in this instance it isn\u2019t all about her- it impacts you too. Being considerate and respecting your partner\u2019s comfort is a two way street. It\u2019s not like you told her to never wear the harness, or insulted how she looked in it, or told her she can\u2019t express herself. She can\u2019t think of any other way to express herself than by wearing a harness to a gathering with your coworkers? It would have cost her nothing to put the harness in a bag to wear later. \n\nAlso, the \u201cnot being yourself\u201d around coworkers comment is ridiculous. It is perfectly normal to not expose the people you work with to every aspect of your personality and interests. I have a super morbid sense of humor- but I don\u2019t go around telling my coworkers those kind of jokes because certainly there will be someone who is made super uncomfortable. My husband and I swear like sailors normally, but we reign it in at work because again, our coworker\u2019s don\u2019t need to be exposed to that side of us and it isn\u2019t considered appropriate in a work environment. You may or may not be into kink in your sex life, but thats often the perception that other people have when they see harnesses as accessories- that isn\u2019t something people typically want to announce to their coworkers and it is NORMAL to maintain that kind of privacy. \n\nShe\u2019s using the feminism argument as a way to manipulate you into feeling guilty, like you\u2019re a \u201cbad feminist\u201d, so that she can have her way- and that really grinds my gears.", "Unless you work in a barn or a dog training facility, I dont know who in their right mind would even think to bring up wearing a harness for meeting your co-workers for the first time.

Talk it out immediately. Stay as calm as you can, and make sure you really listen to her and she to you. Both of you understand that while you try to stay calm, this has the makings of a passionate talk with a lot of emotion. Sometimes, they cab take over.

But it's important to figure out what's going on, especially if this type of outburst and feelings are unusual. I can give you so many ideas on to help keep a convo calm and make sure everyone is heard and gets a chance to speak. I'm happy to share if anyone wants. What I will say though is this. When dealing with these tough conversations that have a lot of emotion involved l, it's easy to think and feel the worse. It's easy to allow the emotions Jump you into thinking the other is putting you down and not caring. Combat this by making sure you tell the other something you love about them anytime a \"i dont like this\" comment is made. Start the conversation off. Each says 3-5 things (pick a number and make it the same number for both) that you love about each other. Do the same anytime you come back from taking a break.

I had also made plans the same evening to grab drinks with my work colleagues. I work in a formal environment, surrounded by a majority of conservative people. i've been working there for two years, this was the first time I agreed to an invitation to go for drinks with colleagues my age. Nothing bad about them, they're just not my crowd. \n\nMy partner mentioned several times that i don't introduce her to work colleagues. While this is accurate, it comes form my lack of active social involvement rather than any deliberate exclusion. I hardly ever go to post-work social events or gatherings. However. t he drinks that night seemed like the perfect opportunity to introduce her and have a drink before heading to the event.\n\nWhile getting ready, my partner tried on a harness over her t-shirt and asked for my opinion (It was a fake leather harness with metal details). Initially, I thought she was joking, but when I realized she wasn't, I politely said that perhaps the harness might not be suitable for meeting my work colleagues. Her response was abrupt - she left the room without a word. Later, she returned to tell me to go to the drinks alone and that we'd meet at the party later. Her reaction took me by surprise as I didn't think my request was unreasonable. Deciding to let it pass, I left to meet my colleagues.\n\nLater that night we met up at the party venue and had the biggest argument we've ever had since we got together 8 years ago.\n\nThe core of my partner's argument was this: She felt I had not supported her in her desire to express herself. All her life she had conformed to societal expectations of how a woman should dress and behave. My request for her not to wear the harness was representative of me conforming with patriarchal norms. She said I was uncomfortable because I couldn't fully be myself around my work colleagues, that I cared too much about their opinions, and I shouldn't. After all, a harness is just an accessory, not necessarily kinky at all.\n\nFrom my perspective, this argument was not about feminism. I was baffled that I had to justify to my partner of 8 years why wearing a harness for the first time meeting with my work colleagues might be inappropriate. I felt we did not live in a shared reality. Couldn't she see how it could make me uncomfortable? Why did her disappointment over my perceived lack of support override the reality of our social setting? couldn't she see that i am the one who bears the consequences of that choice, or did she simply disregard my feelings about it?\n\nIt has been a month since this argument. Since then she brought our argument up when talking about feminism. In her view, my defensiveness towards her accusing me of conforming with patriarchal norms comes from my tendency to distance myself form hypermasculinity, and not because I actually think I did nothing wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Access to healthcare, food in our bellies, and a roof over our heads are materially more important than making a political statement. I hope your partner can understand that this wasn't her gamble to make. She's not the employee who could be fired because \"your performance isn't adequate\" or because you have bigoted teammates who would treat you differently and sabotage you. Ask her if 1 hour of her getting to visibly wear that harness is worth the 4 months of stress it might take for you to find another job. \n\nAnd you've been together 8 years.

We're getting a one-sided very limited version of events.\n\nAnd again, if it was as simple as an outfit it wouldn't be going on for months. And if it is that simple OP needs to run. Such a simple fight lasted so long is perhaps the biggest red flag ever.\n\nAlso that was talk about femininity and traditional gender expression. So I think the exploration of the harness is a form of growth.\n\nNow you probably going to say is fine. All well and good but still a time and a place. And sure I would agree with it. But OP laughing and then just saying no that's not appropriate, is a bad way to handle that. It doesn't support her journey.\n\nYou need to be tactful about these things.", "We always get a one-sided view of things, and that\u2019s what we have to judge. All you\u2019re doing is speculating and trying to find deeper meaning where there may be none. \n\nI\u2019ll agree, laughing was not the most tactful reaction. Neither is ditching your partner and turning not being able to wear an inappropriate accessory into a months long argument. Not every action your partner does needs to be supported, especially when they\u2019re wrong."]}
