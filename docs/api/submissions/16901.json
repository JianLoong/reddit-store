While your girlfriend may not have had bad intentions, sharing your password in a public setting like a dinner with her family can potentially compromise your security and privacy. It's understandable that you were frustrated with her for doing so.  \nHowever, it's important to communicate your concerns in a calm and respectful manner, rather than getting frustrated and causing a tense moment. You could have explained your concerns to your girlfriend privately before the dinner or calmly brought it up during the dinner without making it a big deal.  \nMoving forward, you should consider changing your password to something more secure and unique to avoid potential security breaches.

I don't care that it's just wifi, it's not cool to share someone else password, specifically for this reason. She overstepped. And I'm a firm believer in saying it almost immediately when someone crosses a boundary. Not to have an argument about it, but just a quick mention of \"hey, please don't do that\" in the moment is important. Arguing beyond that indeed is making it awkward for the others. But waiting until you're alone together allows for people to literally forget that they did the thing, or to downplay it etc. So in the moment, short and sweet is always better. \n\nHowever, for your own sake you should certainly get a password protector app and set up stronger and different passwords for each account.

First off, making your passwords similar is, by a cyber security standpoint, not smart. And, yes, this is a major point that must be addressed. And, yes, I will get to what you are asking about. This is very much tied to it. Second off, once your password has been given out to anyone, it is considered compromised. You have no idea if anyone you pass it off to will be goofy enough to share it. And you got a bit of a lesson there that, yes, people will spread that faster than head lice. Also, you have no clue if her family will or won\u2019t try to compromise anything of yours.

First off, change your passwords. All of them. Including social media and email. If you must have things that are similar, pick your favorite words and favorite numbers, make two lists, choose one from each list and don\u2019t repeat. Do not choose anything related to your username. Make it hard to brute force and guess your credentials. Now add in characters and uppercase letters.

And C. While I know it\u2019s obvious but have you actually told your gf to not share it? The reason I ask is because most people are really careless with wifi network keys. They don\u2019t consider it a big deal since it is really high on the list of shared passwords, right up there with phone passcodes and Netflix logins credentials. PSA, don\u2019t share those either, folks! Y\u2019all have your credit card info there! \n\nLook, I don\u2019t think anyone in this story is a bad person. Careless, yes, but the the AH rating is merely because everyone here is making frustrating choices that are easily fixed once pride is told to take a backseat. GF does owe you an apology because blabbing passwords is a massive breach of privacy and common sense, not to mention trust. You owe gf an apology for going off in front of everyone. I do get your frustration. I absolutely do. But dressing them down in public only makes them double down and get defensive. And only gets you more upset. Apologize for that and then calmly explain that even if the password is \u2018sparklyunicornfarts27\u2019 and she can\u2019t stop squealing over it, it has to stay secret.

That\u2019s definitely important to share for privacy sake.", "Yeah, but I wouldn't ask my friend Bill if I can use Ana's bathroom. I would ask Ana.", "It\u2019s really a matter of what you consider private.

I have an extra network in my bedroom due to walls, and I don't have to pay any more than normal, I just had to buy a cheap router.
