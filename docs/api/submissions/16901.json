When i gave it to  her, she thought it was \"cute\". Now i know this is my own failings as a user, but most of my passwords for all my stuff is a similar variation of this certain string. So later on we were at dinner with her close family; mom, aunt, uncle, grandma. My gf went on to mention my password and saying something like \"isn't it so cute?\". I got frustrated and told her to not mention my private passwords. When she said she just wanted to show how cute it was, i said then she should just say its cute but not say the actual password itself. This caused a little bit of a tense moment before the aunt changed the conversation. Then me and my gf were cold with each other for hours afterwards and we still don't know who was in the right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know she had no bad intentions, and i don't expect her family to come hack my wifi or anything else, its just a really bad practice to be blurting out passwords like that plus its so similar to the passwords for my banking app and such, so that's why I caused the tense moment.

There was no need to have what should have been a private discussion between you and your girlfriend in front of others. \n\nAlso, this is an excellent learning opportunity as to why passwords that you're likely to need to share with others -- like your WiFi password -- shouldn't be similar to passwords that you will absolutely never share with others -- like banking passwords. \n\nAlso also, there's absolutely no reason why your girlfriend would have expected your WiFi password to be (or be similar to) passwords you use for actually secure things, so you probably owe her an apology for making an issue of it in the first place.", "YTA, but not for the reason you think: ***Your WiFi password should not be similar to any other passwords you have, and you should change all of them to avoid this issue.***", "YTA. The chances of someone remembering your password AND being able to access your banking info are extremely slim to none. Your reaction was overkill. You could have mentioned it privately later to your girlfriend.", "YTA- it\u2019s common to give Wi-Fi pass to guests. It\u2019s your mistake for making the password similar to important ones.", "You are not the asshole for speaking up about the situation at dinner. While your girlfriend may not have had bad intentions, sharing your password in a public setting like a dinner with her family can potentially compromise your security and privacy. It's understandable that you were frustrated with her for doing so.  \nHowever, it's important to communicate your concerns in a calm and respectful manner, rather than getting frustrated and causing a tense moment. You could have explained your concerns to your girlfriend privately before the dinner or calmly brought it up during the dinner without making it a big deal.  \nMoving forward, you should consider changing your password to something more secure and unique to avoid potential security breaches. It's important to prioritize your own security and privacy, and communicate with your girlfriend about the importance of keeping personal information private in the future.", "YTA. Wifi passwords are only local and aren't that important. Also, you can change it. For you to get pissy over this is immature, not cute.", "YTA \n\nGet password manager and use real good password for banking.

I think getting so upset was an overreaction on your part, especially in front of guests and for something that is so easily remedied. \n\nNext time, you just have to have a polite talk with your gf about it after.\n\nIt sounds like the reason you were so upset was not because she shared it, but because it's similar to your other passwords, but that's on you. \n\nsoft YTA for the overreaction.", "YTA, WiFi passwords are commonly given to guests, they're not particularly private. They had no way of knowing it was similar to any other password until you made a bigger deal out of it, you could have easily brushed it off as a cute WiFi password you thought of. Don't be use the same password for everything, it's ridiculously unsafe and defeats the purpose of passwords.", "ESH\n\nYes she shouldn't have said the password out loud but you shouldn't have gotten mad at her. You could have easily pulled her aside afterward to discuss not sharing the password with anyone else. But no you caused a whole scene in front of her family.", "YTA for making this an issue. Who makes their wifi password the same as their other passwords!!! This is like basic af, like nobody with common sense would assume you did that and that your password was super secret.

I get it,  all my passwords are almost the same.  All of them,  except my wifi.... because other people will at some point need it and I don't need to risk them having my passwords for other things.  Change the wifi to something not close to your banking one my dude.", "So all your passwords are the same including the one you give out to guests. Something i assume she doesn\u2019t know because its insane. And then you berate her in front of her family and make a big deal out of it? No one would have assumed you use it for all of them if you didn\u2019t make a scene. YTA", "Gently, Yta and mildly, an idiot. Get a nice passcode for your WiFi, and change your password schema to something others can guess from simply getting on your WiFi, for preference get some randomly generated passwords that are unique for each log in.", "YTA. This is something you should've done in private and she likely would've been more receptive. Instead you embarrassed her in front of her family and unnecessarily made the situation awkward. \n\nAlso a wifi password is generally a pretty innocuous thing to share and it's not her fault you decided to use variations of it for other, more important things. I think most reasonable people don't do that for what I hope are now obvious reasons", "YTA. Wrong place, wrong time!", "YTA", "Bro.
