He would spend hours just walking on the sand and finding coins and stuff.  Every once in a while he would find jewelry but what I remember most is him helping someone out.  \n\nIt was the end of the day and there was a family taking through the sand obviously looking for something. My grandfather went over to see if he could help. They had lost their car keys. He went back to our car and unpacked his metal detector and found them in about five minutes. The family tried to give him money but he refused.  \n\nI got into the hobby but not as seriously as him. When my family gets to the beach I want to swim and have fun. But I do usually spend at least an hour looking for stuff with the detector my grandpa gave me. It reminds me of hanging out with him. \n\nNone of the other grandkids ever showed an interest so I'm the only one who got a detector. They all kind of think I'm a dork. \n\nSorry for the long intro.\n\nMy family got together for Memorial Day and I spent an hour on the beach with my detector.  I hit the jackpot. I found a diamond ring. It was huge. I put it in my pocket and kept going.  \n\nWhile I was having some food a guy came up to us and asked me if I was the kid with the gadget. I said I was. He asked if I found a ring. I said I had. He said it was his wife's. My dad asked him to prove it.  He pulled up a picture of the ring I found on from his wedding the day before.  \n\nI gave it back to him and he freaked out. I guess it was a family heirloom and worth a lot of money. But mostly his wife was literally puking her guts out for losing it.  He pulled out his wallet and gave me $500. I said no it wasn't necessary but he insisted. He gave it to me and walked away.  \n\nMy cousins and sister think I should share the reward but I didn't think that was fair so I said no.  They think I'm being greedy. My dad said I should share but it was my choice. My mom said her dad would be proud of me for trying to not take a reward but that I deserved it.", "created_utc": 1685812292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zj2a4/aita_for_not_sharing_a_reward_with_my_family/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't share.", "NTA-ish.  Your cousins and sister are being really entitled, and I'd be inclined to say no just because of that, but families often share windfalls and it would have been nice to give each $10 or $20 just to be generous", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason to share with anyone -- your choice only. This is all about what you alone did. And kudos to your mom for what she said.", "NTA and I'm puzzled why they would make a claim for it. That's really weird.

They had literally nothing to do with you finding the ring so they certainly don't have any claim on the reward. How bizarre and entitled for anyone to even suggest this.\n\nNTA\n\nThose who suggested sharing it are major AHs and so is your dad to be honest. \n\nYour mum is right.

Your cousins are young and think what is yours is theirs....that's not how life works. You learned and applied a skill while they chose not to. \n\nSo proud of you and you are not a dork. These folks will never forget how you turned their horrific wedding week experience into a win! You were gracious to decline the award but yes, you deserved it!
