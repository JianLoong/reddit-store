That story of the lost and found ring is now part of there history. That story will live on forever. All because you did something your Granddad had a passion for and shared with you. You consider that 500 as Pennie\u2019s from heaven. And bless your heart for returning that ring. Such a heartwarming day. Granddad would be so proud of you. Heck, I\u2019M proud of you.

What he gave them was so much more valuable than the monetary value of the ring itself!\n\nOP did such a nice deed, not expecting anything, and his family, having done nothing, expects everything to be shared.\n\nJust how silly.
