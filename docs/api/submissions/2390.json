I have a part-time job that pays pennies and so, Hailey stepped up and said she would take care of all my needs for the next six months (enough for me to settle and get a better paying job). She said that it would be easier for her to bring me weekly cooked meals in bulk as she has a housekeeper and rarely gives me any money other than that.\n\nOf course, I was more than grateful for her help at the time. But the problem is that the cooked meals taste.. really bad. Like, sometimes they're bland or too salty, at other times they're undercooked. As a result, I've often had to make another meal on the spot or eat out. Two months in, I'm now all out of savings and couldn't keep doing this. In addition to this, there are other hidden costs like buying course textbooks and printing out project sheets..etc.  So, I reached out to mom and asked her if she could lend me some money to which she said yes.\n\nWhen Hailey found out though, she was very upset that I went to mom \"behind her back\". She said I made it look like she wasn't taking good care of me. I apologized and told her that even though I told her my food preferences she can't possibly meet them all the time and that I would need to make my own food from time to time. I asked her if she could give me the money she spends to make the meals instead of cooking for me from now on so I could take care of my own meals, to which she said she can't afford to.\n\nWhen I told my other sister what happened and asked for advice she was livid and said that it was rude of me to ask Hailey for money instead of meals because that might be the only way she's capable of helping and that I caused her and mom to fight. I still don't understand why what I did was so wrong. I really just didn't want to trouble her anymore with the cooking.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit to add info: The food is not thrown away. I eat it anyway but it doesn't make me full nor like I ate my fill. I would be hungry two hours later and end up making something like an omelette, canned tuna sandwich, noodles, or just bread with butter and jam with milk. She's not the one who cooks, it's her housekeeper that does the cooking in bulk, refrigerated meals that I then keep in the fridge.", "created_utc": 1668516817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvwdig/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_help_by_giving_me/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not unappreciative of what she has done but it doesn't meet with the expectation that she provided to mom and me.
