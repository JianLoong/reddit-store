I would've been an arsehole if I'd known whose food it was and taken it anyway.\n\nBut once you take delivery of the food,  food safety laws will usually dictate that the restaurant or uber eats can't take it back. They can't guarantee that it isn't now laden with bacteria that will kill the person who eats it. *(A huge amount of trust goes into ordering food!)*\n\nCorrect protocol when this happens is to contact uber eats, get a refund, and -- if you can afford it -- reorder. If hangry dude couldn't afford to reorder until the refund was processed, that sucks... but if you hadn't eaten the food, for all he knows it's been sitting out at the perfect temperature to grow bacteria.

This then becomes the restaurant\u2019s prerogative if they replace the meal.) or the driver read the address wrong (driver error.)

Someone ordered donuts to my work. We have over a thousand people in there so normally I just put it to the side and someone eventually comes asking for it. Did the same thing but no one ever picked it up. The name didn\u2019t match anyone in our directory and I even had the Uber eats guy call and text the person multiple times (there were 3 different \u201cfront\u201d doors and desks) to let them know which door it was at but no one came. They were there from like 10 AM till we closed at 4. The (very) few times an order was never picked up we just tossed the food but since it was donuts I just offered it to the staff leaving for the day. \n\nNext day I get a call from someone in the building asking about the order. Long story short her girlfriend made the surprise order to her (hence why the name didn\u2019t come up) and she was pissssed. I explained over and over about how they tried contacting her girlfriend multiple times, they sat there all day, just contact Uber eats and get a refund since technically it wouldn\u2019t be a lie to say you never got them. \nNope. She harassed me, took photos of me, made complaints to HR and eventually called the cops on me. \n\nThankfully both Uber eats and the cops said I was fine and I had done nothing wrong. Even HR sided with me since technically accepting food orders is not one of my responsibilities. Unfortunately for people on my building though I stopped accepting any deliveries unless we were able to get you on the phone on the spot.", "NTA - A good friend of mine who used to live with me did this shortly after they moved out. A week or two after they moved a massive order of a large pizza and a large pizza box filled with chips and another with sausages and chicken tender and a 2L bottle of coke. I asked the driver if the food was for X and they didn't have the receipt or name on them, I asked them to check and they said \"bro this is the address on the order, either take the food or don't but I aint going to another address\". Whole house was well fed that night. about 20 mins after eating all the food I get a call asking if I had received an order... yes yes I had and it was eaten. I asked my friend if they wanted to come over and grab it and they said no... they learned a 30-50eur lesson , I got free food and the driver got paid.   \n\n\nThank you for sharing your story OP, you reminded me of a great night from only a few years back.", "I was in a similar situation last year. I was leaving the house and saw a delivery package on our front porch. I took a quick look at it to see if it was one of my roommates or the people who lived upstairs, and it wasn't, so I just left it there, thinking that maybe it was a neighbor's. When I came back an hour later, it was still there, so at that point, I figured it was OK to grab. It was some kind of Brazilian shrimp dish with rice. I ate it and it was pretty good, and never heard a thing about it. See the difference? I gave it enough time to work itself out, which you didn't. That's why you are TA in this scenario. YTA", "Just pay him for his food , I wouldn\u2019t have ate it honestly. It happened to me once and I left it in the main entrance in our apartment block and eventually the owner took his food.

The guy is right.", "Yta you should have just declined the food lol", "$50 for food!? Wtf? That's too much. Hopefully it was for like 4 people\n\nNTA btw. I'm just blown away at the extent of the food price", "That reminds me. My BF makes and sells something custom on eBay and has a buyer who last minute added a new address in the NOTES section for the purchase. But eBay creates shipping labels based on what you put in the address section. So my bf shipped it to the address indicated on the autogenerated label and it arrived per tracking and now this person is claiming they didn\u2019t get it and they want a refund. \ud83d\ude44 he won\u2019t answer any questions to resolve it though. Why are people like this?", "So the food should've been thrown away, since it couldn't be delivered in a timely fashion?", "I now need to know everything about the tiny stomach dragons.", "Is this how you justify greed? What becomes of food you didn't order and pay for affects you how? The delivery person could contact the correct person or be contacted by that person for delivery, take the food ba mcl to the restaurant, give it to a homeless person or whatever...it's none of your business. \n\nDon't pretend yol take food for ethical reasons...at least admit it if you're an opportunist...live your truth", "Idk why you seem to be taking this so personally but I don\u2019t believe for a second that the reasonable expectation of someone is that they will take time out of their day to correct someone else\u2019s mistake for\u2026 reasons? I also highly doubt that you would honestly jump thru all of these hoops if actually put into the same situation but I digress\u2026\n\nOkay, OP contacts Uber support. Then what? They probably tell them the same thing the driver did. There\u2019s no way that Ubereats is going to contact the person who ordered to coordinate a handoff or advocate that they give food that\u2019s already been handled by a stranger back. Best case scenario, you\u2019ve just saved the person ordering from reporting that they need a refund but they are going to do that regardless because they won\u2019t know that OP called. Waste of their own time. \n\nCalling the restaurant is even dumber because restaurants that partner with delivery apps do not have any control over food or service once the order leaves the shop. Restaurants don\u2019t get info about the delivery or the driver beyond having the general info like name and address. Because they made the food and did everything right on their end as far as giving it to the correct driver, they cannot initiate a cancel/refund/remake on their end. Calling them would once again be a waste of OP\u2019s time. \n\nYour expectations are weird and unreasonable. Is it annoying to have made a mistake when ordering? Yes. But this person had ample opportunity to correct their mistake as Ubereats flashes the address used many times throughout ordering. If they were following along on the delivery map they should have seen both that it was the incorrect address and that the driver was not driving toward their location. That\u2019s 100% on them.", "The driver delivered to the address listed. That driver likely makes below minimum wage after taxes and mileage and if they\u2019re lucky enough to be making a decent wage, they are cranking orders out as quickly as possible to be able to make a normal amount of money. That isn\u2019t the drivers fault, it\u2019s Uber\u2019s and it\u2019s a problem you\u2019re going to run into when using these services since they abuse and take advantage of workers to the benefit of the corporation and consumers. \n\nMost deliveries before tip sit around $3-8. Most deliveries take between 30 minutes to an hour to complete. Asking someone to waste their own time to correct a mistake that you made is rude and entitled. Calling this driver lazy is a lazy excuse in itself. \n\nWhy are you so hung up on making the driver and OP into the assholes when they only reason they are in the situation is because of this random person who can\u2019t pull their head out of their own ass far enough to pay attention to something that *they ordered.* Take responsibility for your own mistakes- expecting others to clean it up is the very definition of childish.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know why you seem to be taking this so personally\u201c \n\nSays the person who just wrote the Gettysburg Address about a Uber order lol. \n\nFor the record, yes I would make an effort to resolve the matter. It only takes a couple of minutes. I mean, look how much effort you put in to try to convince me that I\u2019m wrong!\n\nSurely you could expend that much energy to connect the food with its rightful owner. \n\nIf I speak to Uber directly and they tell me to keep the food, then I\u2019m going to keep it. At least I have more confidence in the platform rather than some wacko driver.", "Why are you so hung up on my opinion? I\u2019m allowed to have my opinion. You don\u2019t have to agree with it. Yes, a driver is lazy if he makes no effort to fix his mistake after being told it\u2019s the wrong address. At the very least, he could\u2019ve double checked the order to make sure he was at the correct location. And if it\u2019s a shitty job, then he should not take that job.", "> I told him I didn't order food, but we both double checked the address in his app, and he was at the right place.\n\nHe did double check the order. Plus the guy will get a refund for not getting his order, which the uber driver can confirm, so all he really missed out on was not getting a refund AND his meal. Kind of makes me wonder if that's what he was going for in the first place.", "NTA but why did you take it? A random guy shows up with food and says it's delivery but he must have the wrong address and you just take it and eat it? Obviously it turned out fine but why would you trust that food? I would assume it was some weird poising scam because even if you aren't aware, the delivery driver would know he can text the person who ordered the food and get the correct address, and that i think they are supposed to give people a certain amount of time to reply to help the driver find them or Uber will tell the driver that the driver can keep/eat the food. The driver is in the wrong, not you, but there is protocol, and giving food to someone who did not order or pay for food just because they happen to be at the incorrect address at the right time is not the protocol for any delivery service. So fuck yes, just eating some random food that gets delivered to your house by mistake is insane. But like, technically I guess you didn't do anything wrong since you're not obligated to know the rules of a delivery company.\n\nAlso I just feel like I should throw out there if you see a big white van with no windows that promises you free candy if you get inside of it - that is not free candy. Just buy your own.", "The AH here is the Uber driver. He didn't text the person to tell them they couldn't find the place. He probably marked it as delivered and now the dude can't get a replacement order so he's taking it out on you.", "NTA.

They can\u2019t legally redeliver it after it was given to you", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't order it, didn't pay for it, and shouldn't have accepted it. \"hehe free food\" No, it's food you essentially stole. Driver was an AH as well, for being too lazy to message the person and get it sorted out.", "I'm going with ESH, but the delivery guy was probably the worst since he never should have left it with you.", "Similar sort of scam happened to a buddy of mine living in an apartment building, the guy was relatively clever about it and got away with it for months. He'd just rotate through different apps and restaurants so as not to raise any red flags, and then he'd pick a different neighbour each time as well so they didn't have too many repeat events.\n\nEventually one of the neighbours clued in, 3rd time it happened, and started asking other people. When they discovered the extent of it, they used the information to evict the person from the building. Don't know if they bothered taking it to law enforcement or anything, probably not worth it really.", "Throw in a stolen credit card and this is 100% a solid scam to turn stolen funds into untraceable money.", "Once the driver has the food I don't think you can change the address.", "Where do I get these dragon eggs?

The company can\u2019t take it back and the guy can just get a refund", "I've never had food mis-delivered to me, but my understanding of the food delivery places is that the driver is done when the driver delivers the food to the destination.  They aren't heading back to the restaurant -- they are going on to make their next delivery.  They are done with the food.  If they can't deliver it, they can eat it, they can throw it away, they can say, \"Well, this is where I was paid to deliver the food, you take it.\"\n\nWhich, in this case, is what OP said happened.\n\nAs many other commenters have pointed out, once the food is out of control of the driver, it isn't safe to give it to anyone else.  And it isn't something that you can leave sitting around the apartment, waiting for someone to show up, as the bacterial load grows.\n\nAs far as ethics go, if I order one of an item from Amazon, and get three, I contact Amazon.  If a package mistakenly winds up on my porch, I'll make sure it gets to the appropriate recipient.\n\nAnd if someone tells me that I can have some food because otherwise it'll be thrown away, I'll generally eat it."]}
