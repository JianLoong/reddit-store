I would've been an arsehole if I'd known whose food it was and taken it anyway.\n\nBut once you take delivery of the food,  food safety laws will usually dictate that the restaurant or uber eats can't take it back. They can't guarantee that it isn't now laden with bacteria that will kill the person who eats it. *(A huge amount of trust goes into ordering food!)*\n\nCorrect protocol when this happens is to contact uber eats, get a refund, and -- if you can afford it -- reorder. If hangry dude couldn't afford to reorder until the refund was processed, that sucks... but if you hadn't eaten the food, for all he knows it's been sitting out at the perfect temperature to grow bacteria. Or you've been sticking body parts into it. Or licking it.\n\nNTA, even if hangry dude was legit and just weirdly trusting of complete strangers' food handling. \n\nBut I'm guessing this was a scam -- dude buys meal, puts in the wrong address, waits for delivery, gets a refund because he didn't get his food, waits 20-30 minutes, goes to wrong address to intimidate resident into giving up the cost of the meal. Profit!", "NTA- i would have done the same thing. It\u2019s mostly the drivers fault for not checking with the buyer after you said it wasn\u2019t your food.", "NTA, but with a side of everyone sucks here. Like you tried to get the uber driver to take it back, they didn't. Rando shows up to your house later and is angry that you ate his food when it was he who made a mistake entering his address.", "NTA", "NTA. These company\u2019s have rules on this. Delivered food, cannot be returned to the driver, once delivered. The driver cannot come back and pick up a wrongly delivered order. \n\nEither the buyer entered the wrong address (it happens, and is their error. This then becomes the restaurant\u2019s prerogative if they replace the meal.) or the driver read the address wrong (driver error.) Either way, you do not owe the driver anything.\n\nIt might even be a scam. Driver gets $50 from you, tells restaurant order was wrongly input (claiming buyer error. Restaurant rushes new order,) and driver delivers order correctly. \n\nNTA.\n\nI had one recently. Ordered two all day breakfasts. Got my order, and also got someone else\u2019s chocolate milk, tied to my bag. I contacted the driver, told him the bag had a house number close to mine, but no actual address. He told me to keep the milk. And he was already in the process of retrieving another one from the restaurant to go to the right house. So\u2026 free drink.", "NTA: when Uber eats makes a mistake with a delivery, they send a refund *and* offer to redeliver the same meal\u2026\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t had eaten it, it would have been wasted anyways. \n\nAlso, sounds like the guy who actually ordered the food realised the mistake he made, so he was hoping to get the refund, the original meal and the new meal.", "Could this be some kind of a scam?? I remember reading one about the person who \"bumped\" into a guy walking and eating nachos. The nachos fell down and asked the person for money to replace the ruined food. \n\nOr does this sort of thing happen all the time with uber eats? I have never ordered from them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Also there is no way I am leaving a bag of food outside my door hoping someone will come and claim it.  Most likely it is going to be claimed by an animal and then that is just another mess I have to clean up.

They spoke with the driver and confirmed the address, and told the driver that they hadn't ordered any food. The driver told them to keep it. OP did nothing wrong here.\n\nI strongly suspect the buyer was banned from the delivery service and was trying to circumvent the ban by getting food delivered to a different, but nearby address.", "OP confirmed with the driver that it was delivered to the correct address, and tried to give it back. The driver told OP to keep it and enjoy the free food.\n\nIf the buyer wanted food delivered to his house, he should have entered the correct delivery address. Clearly he knew how to check it, he managed to get to OP's house and knock on the door.\n\nMy guess is that the buyer had been banned from the delivery service prior, and they were trying to circumvent the ban by getting the food delivered to a different but nearby address."]}
