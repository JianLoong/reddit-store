I think I'm kind of an asshole here but I'm not sure. Anyway, here goes:\n\nI started a new job in September after a tumultuous year of looking for work. It is a warehouse position, which I have never done before, and has quite the learning curve. Over time I have realized the other employees have not kept good care of the tools and some days this has left me in a tight spot. \n\nMy wife loves her own job. She recently started a new position and adores it. For her, work is pretty much life. It is her central focus and she honestly doesn't have a lot of hobbies or social life outside of work. I am the opposite. To me, work is just a means to an end. A way to make money to pay for the lifestyle I want for my family. I'll go 9-5 but my focus is always on personal life and hobbies outside of work. \n\nLately my wife has been using every occasion to get me new tools for my job. She keeps buying me work related gifts and while they are appreciated, they honestly feel like a husband buying their wife a washing machine for Christmas. Since I like to keep work and personal life separate, the idea of a work related personal gift doesn't make sense to me. I am also into nerdy stuff like MtG, Warhammer, DnD, and video games. Sometimes I worry my family and wife think these types of gifts are too juvenile and therefore it doesn't even cross their radar. But honestly they are the types of gifts I'd most like to receive. \n\nWe recently just celebrated our first anniversary and my wife got me a new tool bag with a plethora of tools for my job. I am very appreciative and many of the tools will also help around the house, but admittedly I was a little disappointed. I got her a nice personal jewel necklace and it kind of feels like my gift was missing that personal touch. I know this is just because my wife loves her job and would be ecstatic to receive work tools, but I am not that way. \n\nThe other day we were in the hardware store and my wife said she was shopping for Christmas gifts and needed me to go to a different aisle. I did sigh, but I decided to mention to her, \"hey, while I do appreciate the work gifts, I'd really love some personal fun gifts as well\". She immediately went pale and became upset. She said that I was lying about liking her gift for our anniversary and that I am unappreciative of the stuff I have received. I tried to explain that wasn't the case, I'd just like some personal fun as well, but she wasn't having it. Now I worry she will freeze every time she shops for me and be paralyzed with what to get. \n\nAITA?

You were right to share this and it sounds like you did so in a very sensitive manner at an appropriate time (ie, not immediately after opening a work gift). She sounds like she just reacted insecurely, give her some time to come around, but you\u2019re definitely NTA for communicating respectfully.", "NTA.  But it's way past time for you two to have an adult conversation about how you see work and the kinds of gifts that you like to receive.", "NTA. If it was bothering you she should hear about it. \n\nHopefully she will realize that doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t appreciate her gift. I would be happy with tools or nerdy stuff, but I\u2019d probably enjoy the nerdy stuff more too.\n\nI think you should explain the washing machine analogy to her after she calms down. Idk maybe don\u2019t, but it made sense to me lmao.", "NTA- the joy of gift giving is the figuring out that perfect gift that truly fulfills the recipient\u2019s desire/s. She\u2019s not stepping out of her own mindset. She also shouldn\u2019t be upset that you\u2019re expressing what you\u2019d prefer to receive as gifts. Does she expect you to receive a lifetime of gifts that didn\u2019t bring you joy? She needs to think about the person she\u2019s gifting and stop applying the well\u2026 \u201cif this was me, these are the types of gifts I\u2019d want to receive\u201d. (Work related gifts). Just have another conversation with her. I know her feelings were hurt (that\u2019s life and marriage), but she needs to get past it.", "NTA, I think it's terrible to get gifts for my job. Especially for something like an anniversary. Then you don't buy tools, unless your partners hobby is DIY, but i would choose something personal.\nYour comparison hits the nail on the head, you don't buy a washing machine for her, because it's not personal, it's something for the family, so why does she give you impersonal generic gifts?", "NTA but she probably reacted so strongly because you blindsided her with this in public. probably would have been better to say something earlier", "NTA - it's reasonable.\n\nAnd I think you're onto something about your family not thinking your interests are 'adult' enough.", "NAH. I totally see where you\u2019re coming from - I used to be in finance and if my husband got me calculators and pens for Christmas I\u2019d feel the same way. But it also makes sense that her feelings would be a little hurt and she\u2019d be self-conscious about her gift-giving for a bit. Give it some time, I don\u2019t think anyone did anything wrong here and hopefully your wife will find joy in picking out new kinds of gifts for you, she seems like a very giving and thoughtful person.", "NTA.\n\nYou probably should've told her sooner actually.  The fact that she got upset and accused you of lying for saying what you'd prefer is pretty shitty on her part", "Uh do people not do Christmas lists anymore?", "NAH. But make a \"Wish List\" box and put slips of paper in there all year long as you think of gifts you like.  This makes it possible for others to at least get some ideas without the uncomfortable feeling of coming to you to ask what you want.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with wanting both practical and fun kinds of gifts.\n\nIt sounds to me like your wife's had some really ungrateful gift receivers in her past that informed her response. Keep reassuring her, using the tools, and buying gifts for her that exemplify both ends of the spectrum so she can see you mean it, for her and you. Good luck.", "NTA but kids aren\u2019t the only ones who make Christmas lists!  My mom still asks for lists of what we\u2019d like, we usually put like 10 things so she has options (obvi we don\u2019t go extreme nothing that costs like 150+ and we don\u2019t expect the whole list she just uses it as a base she\u2019ll still get things not in the list etc) but it\u2019s so much easier for her to buy us stuff as we\u2019re older and it\u2019s also good for us who never know what we want, or have particular tastes.  \nThis whole mind reading thing of getting gifts, I don\u2019t know what my friend wants it\u2019s easier to just ask or be told", "NAH. You communicated your wants and needs in a respectful manner. She was probably upset because she thought you didn't like what she got you previously. Just give her some time to process it.", "NAH - I get where you're coming from... you don't want work to be your life, and I'm with you, I don't want work related gifts at all, I want gifts that reflect me and my hobbies and pursuits, not my job which I try to leave behind at the end of each day.\n\nAt the same time, your wife is buying things based on what she imagines she'd appreciate. She's doing a good thing, and this is just one of those things newlyweds have to sort out in time and with experience.  I know it took my wife several years to figure out the kinds of gifts I really enjoyed, but I appreciate everything she's ever done for me and make sure to tell her so every chance I get.\n\nNo either of you are assholes, you're just newlyweds, so figure out how to communicate better and learn each other better.", "You\u2019re not an asshole, but 1 thing comes to my mind -\n\nYou can\u2019t choose the gifts you get. But you can ask for things you like. While it\u2019s not awful, but at the store a couple weeks before the holiday is not the best time to get \u201cpicky.\u201d Emotions are high and people get excited when they think they have found a good gift. Just something to keep in mind. Plant those seeds in the off season so that it\u2019s more of an understanding rather than a \u201cnot this but that.\u201d Which while you weren\u2019t in the wrong, can lead to the issue you\u2019re experiencing!", "NAH.  You said it yourself: your wife has a hard time separating the personal from the professional.  For her, supporting you in your job probably *is* the most sincere expression of love she can demonstrate.  That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong to want other things, or that she should be taking the request this personally, but just keep trying to talk through each other\u2019s love languages and hopefully you can come to some kind of mutually satisfying compromise.", "NAH I understand where you are both coming from. I think this is just some conversation you should have. \n\nMight I suggest the \"rule\" for gifting children gifts? Something you want, something you need, something to wear and something to read. Tailor it as needed. Maybe something you want, sonething you need and an experience to do together? Set some guidelines to help her remember to get that variety in your gifts.", "NAH.  You can say something but gifts aren't obligations so she can still gift you as she sees fit.", "NAH\n\nI think your problem sounds more like you need to come up with and ask for wishlists.\n\nI think she was unsure of what to get you so went the problem-solution and things you wouldn't purchase for yourself even though it would help route. She probably went overboard because it ended up an easy idea. She also could have thought that it was a personal gift because it was something you could use; some people don't believe that jewelry or flowers are personal gifts- everyone is different. Some people also are not the best gift givers and you can't exactly hold those people to your own expectations.", "NAH.  I think you should explain this to her exactly as you laid it out here.  It makes perfect sense and would explain to her why work gifts feel so impersonal to you, even though you know she put a lot of thought into it, which you appreciate.\n\nThen you should make her a list of things you would actually like.  Because shopping for men can be really hard.", "NAH, sometimes when picking gifts we think about wants and needs from our own perspective a little rather than the perspective of the gift receiver. Your explanation of your wife's views on work vs your own helps explain her thought process for the gifts. You can still appreciate a gift even if it wasn't something you wanted specifically, those are not mutually exclusive.\n\nP.S. as a fellow lover of MtG, Warhammer, video games, and (currently learning) DnD, I hope you have a very nerdy holiday season! \ud83e\udd13\ud83c\udf84", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seriously, it gets old.  Getting something frivolous and fun is ok and requires a bit more thought about what the person would actually like.", "NTA years ago my Uncle gifted my aunt cleaning supplies for her birthday - only the best for her! We all laughed our butts off when he unwrapped his spanky new vacuum cleaner for Christmas. But really, if you guys have a hard time with this what my husband and I have done for years is we do a small gift on Christmas. Then a couple of weeks later we take a day with an agreed amount and we make a day of it. We shop for what we want, do lunch - and the best part is everything is on clearance\n You really get a lot of bang for your buck. When the kids were little we would go during the week, just the two of us, it was lovely.", "NTA.  She is taking your preferences personally.  It isn't about her.  This is about what you like.  You may need to explain it in another way.  Start with you know how much she likes her job, but yours is more an end to a means for you.  That you appreciate the tools, but your employer should be the one purchasing work tools, not your household.  You need to equate it to the vacuum cleaner for a present.  While it may be appreciated if one is really needed, it is not something most people would ask for as a present.  This is coming from someone who has been happy to get appliances as presents and still would be unhappy to get a vacuum.  If she has a hard time shopping for your hobbies, suggest you do an Amazon account for hints for her of things you want.  It can be hard for someone who does not have the same hobbies to know what to pick.", "NTA\u2026 but why don\u2019t you both get into the habit of doing a Christmas list.\n\nJust write out a list of stuff you want, it can be detailed or as vague as you like. \n\nThat will give someone a jumping off point. \nEven if they don\u2019t get something off the list, they will have an idea of what you would like", "NTA\n\nHave you told her what you just told us? Because I think you've got a good handle on the situation. You understand that your wife views work differently than you do, so got you work gifts in the spirit of the golden rule. You did appreciate the thought behind the gifts, but you want to keep work separate from family. \n\nShe was probably really excited about her gifts to you, and may be disappointed in herself for not getting it right. So hearing this may make her sad. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Look, you're newlyweds. There's a learning curve to marriage. Here's a really good rule that has served my husband and me well for over 30 years: none of the problems are you vs her. They are all y'all vs the problem. So here the problem is you not getting gifts that really meet your practical needs or need for understanding. She will want you to have those needs met. The solution is that the two of you communicate, and be willing to set aside defensiveness. It takes a little practice, but you've got a lifetime to work on it!", "NTA a gift is supposed to be about the one receiving it. She should be thinking about what you would like when she\u2019s picking gifts, not necessarily what you need (unless they\u2019re the same thing). There is also nothing wrong with communicating that with her. It\u2019s not like you rejected her previous gifts or got an attitude.", "NTA. I work in an office, if someone gifted me a notepad or any kind of stationary I\u2019d appreciate it but it wouldn\u2019t be something I\u2019d like to receive. I\u2019d prefer thriller or mystery books to read.", "NTA. Your wife won't know what kind of gifts you like if you don't tell her. You communicated your feelings to her, and that's absolutely essential in any relationship. \n\nHer reaction, lashing out at you over previous gifts instead of being apologetic, kinda makes her an AH.", "NTA  this is what wishlists are for.", "NTA.  I rarely say this, but she is pretty sensitive to criticism, isn't she?  One solution would be for each of you to make a \"wish list\" of possible gifts, including a lot of price ranges.  Make it clear you don't expect everything on the list, but these are options of gifts you would enjoy as a hobby.", "I'm into those same things but would never anticipate a gift like that from my family whose eyes glaze over anytime I mention a cool thing a primarch did in a book. You're a grown adult take the work related gifts and buy anything you want. NTA", "NTA but also can you tell me what gifts you do want bc I need to get gifts for someone into all the same shit as you and am clueless.", "NTA.     But give her a wish list and maybe add an itty bitty tool on it too.\nNewlyweds, it\u2019s a learning curve.  First yr we were married my husband got me stuff for the bathroom. I told him thanks, I really like it, but never buy me anything for the house unless I asked for it. Not sure you guys age. I was 21.", "NTA, but haven't y'all heard of Amazon wish lists? I'm sure she has no clue what you would actually like and needs to be told, with links!\n\nA calm conversation about this is also needed", "Nah", "Info - do you have an amazon wish list that you could share with family? If not, I recommend it as it could solve everyone's problem. Even if the item is not bought off amazon, it will tell her exactly what you want.", "NTA.\n\nIt is exactly the same as someone buying a stay at home parent a vacuum cleaner/washing machine or something.\n\nJust because she's upset that she has been getting you things you don't like doesn't mean she's not an asshole for getting you those things in the first place.", "NAH\n\nI'm sure your wife's feelings were a bit hurt, but better to be honest now and not have to have a ton gifts you don't really want. \n\nAlso, stop telling her what tools you are lacking at work. Doesn't she ask you what you actually want for Christmas?", "NAH you just need to communicate better man", "I'd agree if she didn't get upset and accuse him of lying before.  That to me pushes her into ahole territory", "NGL, your comment is coming across a bit sexist to me.\n\nI highly doubt you would be absolving OP of the blame/not calling him an asshole if he was hurt his wife didn't like him gifting her a vacuum cleaner.", "I love this idea", "So you'd be saying NAH if OP bought his wife a vacuum cleaner because he thinks he'd appreciate it in her spot?", "Carrying cases can be wonderful for all of the nerdy gear. For MtG, a nice quality custom deck box is great and useful. For Warhammer and DnD, a way to easily and safely transport miniatures is a must. They make specialized carrying cases that come with magnetized trays that allow for convenient transport and organization. I know those aren't \"fun\" but they can make tabletop gaming in general much easier and are sure to be used. \n\nI'd love to receive dice or dice towers. New comfy computer chair for gaming. Even booster packs of cards, while small, can be a joy to open and see what you get. If they're into painting miniatures, new paints or brushes are great. They also make these cool holders to assist with painting that a miniature can be temporarily mounted on. Playmats are really cool for MtG. If they have a favorite card it usually isn't too hard to find a playmat with the art of the card on it, especially if it's a popular one.", "I agree to a point but I also think that could just be a defensive gut-reaction - like OH SHIT he hates all my gifts!! Anger is easier than embarrassment, if she holds onto the anger though and doesn\u2019t get his point, I\u2019d say she\u2019s an AH.", "It's been working for my family for years. And it's great for kids, who can fill up their box all year long and then I have specific birthday/holiday suggestions to pass along to extended relatives as well.", "Since the OP mentioned that, if his wife is not a professional housecleaner it would have been a YTA for the mysognistic gender role stereotyping and for being petty rather than, as I suggested, working on the communication.\n\nJust as if his wife was buying him chainsaws becuase \"real men know how to use a chainsaw\".\n\nBut neither of those things happened.  What happened is two newlyweds, who are very different personality wise, have different ideas on what to get each other and they, as newlyweds, need to work on the communication and learn what each other really like to buy better gifts.\n\n>Lately my wife has been using every occasion to get me new tools for my job. She keeps buying me work related gifts and while they are appreciated, they honestly feel like a husband buying their wife a washing machine for Christmas.

Sometimes I worry my family and wife think these types of gifts are too juvenile and therefore it doesn't even cross their radar. But honestly they are the types of gifts I'd most like to receive.\n\nShe's bought several gifts like this, but only NOW has he said anything at all, the rest of hte time he's smiled, thanked her gratefully, and, most importantly, not said a thing, according to his narrative.  Is she a mind reader or is she supposed to just intuit she wants the latest Warhammer 40K rule book?  He says he likes those things but fears shed think they're juvenile... and even admits that this is probably why it never even occurs to her how much they would mean to him.\n\n>I know this is just because my wife loves her job and would be ecstatic to receive work tools, but I am not that way\n\nThe OP even agrees with my take on why she's buying things like this... and says he's not like that, but again no indication he's tried actually communicating.\n\n>I did sigh, but I decided to mention to her, \"hey, while I do appreciate the work gifts, I'd really love some personal fun gifts as well\". She immediately went pale and became upset.\n\nFINALLY, some communication, but at this point he's gladly accepted several gifts along this line, so she, quite reasonably, now feels as though he has hated everything she's gotten, thinks shes a shit gift giver, and has only been humoring her with every gift.  He did not intend to hurt her feelings, and isn't an AH here, and this is an opportunity for him to start talking to her about more intimate parts of his life.\n\nShe, likewise, isn't an AH because A: as he says, this is what SHE would like to receive, and in absense of any other direction, people tend to follow what they know, and B: until now she had no idea he didn't want that stuff because he never told her.\n\nSo, NAH, neither one was being spiteful or malicious or trying to hurt the other, it's a simple misunderstanding, and one of those things newly married couples have to learn about each other over time and experience and, as I said, talking with each other honestly and regularly.", "Honestly sounds like she might have trauma with not being \"good enough\" in some way, if she froze (fear response) and went pale (seems a deeper response than mere embarrassment. If I were OP, I'd perhaps come at the situation from that angle. Reassurance and a talk of some kind to explain the situation and more reassurance, and a talk about why her response was so ingrained (obviously if that's being read right)."]}
