This is really my first time running into some thing like this.\n\nSo onto to the story, I was working with 2 other people, one being my manager (38M) and other co-worker (20M). It was a normal day just making orders and etc. And then a mother (I think in her early twenties?) And a child (3F). I ask what she wants to order, just a BLT. Then she says to her child, \"Okay, ask the nice man what you want.\" Now I don't mind people having their child order, but the difference was that she didn't help her child at ALL understand what anything meant or what she was saying, while other parents I've seen have helped their child pick out what they want.\n\nThe child looks at the menu for a 2 minutes and starts to speak. She said she wanted bread with cheese and meat. So I ask her what type of bread? And it looked like her brain blew up because she didn't know there was more than other types of bread. So I tried to dumb it down to her while showing her different types of bread, \"So we have this bread that...and this bread...\" And it seems she doesn't understand at all. So I ask if she would like a kids meal? And the mother  gave me a death stare, but I didn't care the kid didn't understand anything so I asked her again. She looked pretty excited when I said that, so I started to prepare that till the mother stopped me. \"What are you doing?\" She said, and I told her I was making a kids sandwich since that's what I got from her expression. And she started to get pissed saying \"My kid can order a bigger\" and \"She didn't say that\" and while that was true, her expression said otherwise. But it continued for a while till she wanted my manager, I got him and I got in trouble which surprised me abd my manager gave them a discount.\n\nAfter that my manager told me to go home and not come back till I get a text from him. This situation feels so weird and I don't think I was in the wrong.

You ask what they want then you explain to them what to say to order. \n\nThis only frustrates service workers and the kid.", "Hi, friend. I\u2019m a mom of two young kiddos, and all I\u2019m saying is\u2026 as much as I\u2019m willing to give my kids independence, there\u2019s a time and place\u2026 And subway is not it. \n\nIt is not the responsibility of a teenager employed by an establishment to help a child figure out what it is they want to eat. That is the job of their parent. As far as I can tell as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, there\u2019s different responsibilities divided between guests and employees. Employees are responsible for getting customers what they want, even if that includes guiding them to what they want via suggestions. Customers are responsible for communicating effectively. If the customer cannot do that, there\u2019s only so much a service employee can do. \n\nAs for your manager\u2026 it\u2019s really odd he responded like that. Ultimately, if you no longer have a job working under him\u2026 consider yourself lucky. Restaurant jobs are a dime a dozen, and if your employer isn\u2019t keen on having your back in situations like that, you shouldn\u2019t be loyal to his minimum wage anyway. \n\nNTA, you\u2019re doing fine.

If I could barely figure out what my 3 year old wants sometimes (and she has an extensive vocabulary and speaks pretty clearly) why tf would I expect her to decide between all the options offered at subway?\n\nI\u2019m curious to know if your manager has any kids? Because clearly he has high expectations on a 3 year olds ability to place a full sub order at subway with so many options. My daughter could barely decide if she wants a pink or purple sippy cup some mornings \ud83d\ude44", "NTA I don't get what they (mother and manager) expected you to do.

A small child wouldn't know all the options available and you don't have the time to teach everything on the menu to them. \n\nOnly solution for this scenario would have been to ask the parent for clarification, \"Kids meal mum?\" Since they're the ones paying. \n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nStart searching for something else, even at another Subway store if necessary.  Don't go back at all.", "NTA\n\nIt's great she's trying to build the kid's confidence but at 3, she needs to help them so you get a comprehensible order.  I would recommend you start looking for a new job.", "NTA.

That's just life.", "NTA. Parents need to actually order for their kids", "Fuck that parent. Get a different job.\n\nNobody needs to be abused by toddlers, and the fact that Mr. Manager didn't back you up is bullshit.", "NTA - This is just bizarre.  From what you've written, you didn't do anything inappropriate.  If it becomes an issue, you may want to discuss the situation with higher ups, and if there isn't a policy in place on how to handle these situations, one should be created.", "NTA - the kid had no idea what bread and couldnt give you a clear order (well obviously.. without help of its mother).. you helped that child to find what it wants, smth the mother should have done..\n\nThe AH were that mother and also your manager for not sticking up to you...", "NTA. Could the child even read the menu at that age? I could read at 3 yrs old but I know reading a menu and ordering a meal at that age would have been beyond anything I was ready for.\n\nAs unfair as it is if you're in that situation again it may help to start giving less and simpler options such as do you want white bread as opposed to saying do you want white, wheat, rye, Italian herb, etc.", "NTA. You did the best you could. My kid is almost 5 and I don't think he could order when there are that many options. Even if he could, I'd do it for him if there was anybody else in line because it would just take forever.

I think you handled it really well with suggesting a kids meal and that the mom just blew the situation out of proportion, also I would suggest sitting down with your manager and talk about what happened (get ur version of the story out) and what you could do better in the future", "NTA.

You can guide them along and they'll think they're making decisions. If the kid acts confused about all the choices, make the choices for them. \"How about some yummy white bread?\" \"I bet you like ham!\" You can ask them \"mustard or mayonnaise\" and hold up the two bottle so they can visually pick one. There's a good chance the kid will go along with it, and normal parents will correct you if there are any problems.", "NTA the poor kid's brain prob froze from too much info/choice. The mother is an AH for putting that pressure + disrepect on both you and her kid. And your manager is also an AH for not having your back.

You have no idea if the kid is lactose intolerant, or any other kind of allergy.", "INFO \u201cbut it continued for a while till she wanted my manager.\u201d  What exactly was it that continued? \n\nI don\u2019t really like children so instinctively I want to blame the parent. But I also believe that you don\u2019t argue with customers. I would have asked what the kid wanted and then just stared at them until they answered. So I\u2019m wondering what escalated this.

Typically there's so much more for me to do other than make the sub so these slow orders really set the whole store back. People don't realize every thing they see in front of them has been prepped but someone's actually hands and energy, and that there's always more to do than just serve them. I've ignored children that were ordering because I literally couldn't hear what they were saying. Instead I turned to the parent and ask what they would like for their kid.
