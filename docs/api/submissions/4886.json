This is really my first time running into some thing like this.\n\nSo onto to the story, I was working with 2 other people, one being my manager (38M) and other co-worker (20M). It was a normal day just making orders and etc. And then a mother (I think in her early twenties?) And a child (3F). I ask what she wants to order, just a BLT. Then she says to her child, \"Okay, ask the nice man what you want.\" Now I don't mind people having their child order, but the difference was that she didn't help her child at ALL understand what anything meant or what she was saying, while other parents I've seen have helped their child pick out what they want.\n\nThe child looks at the menu for a 2 minutes and starts to speak. She said she wanted bread with cheese and meat. So I ask her what type of bread? And it looked like her brain blew up because she didn't know there was more than other types of bread. So I tried to dumb it down to her while showing her different types of bread, \"So we have this bread that...and this bread...\" And it seems she doesn't understand at all. So I ask if she would like a kids meal? And the mother  gave me a death stare, but I didn't care the kid didn't understand anything so I asked her again. She looked pretty excited when I said that, so I started to prepare that till the mother stopped me. \"What are you doing?\" She said, and I told her I was making a kids sandwich since that's what I got from her expression. And she started to get pissed saying \"My kid can order a bigger\" and \"She didn't say that\" and while that was true, her expression said otherwise. But it continued for a while till she wanted my manager, I got him and I got in trouble which surprised me abd my manager gave them a discount.\n\nAfter that my manager told me to go home and not come back till I get a text from him.

I\u2019m a mom of two young kiddos, and all I\u2019m saying is\u2026 as much as I\u2019m willing to give my kids independence, there\u2019s a time and place\u2026 And subway is not it. \n\nIt is not the responsibility of a teenager employed by an establishment to help a child figure out what it is they want to eat. That is the job of their parent. As far as I can tell as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, there\u2019s different responsibilities divided between guests and employees. Employees are responsible for getting customers what they want, even if that includes guiding them to what they want via suggestions. Customers are responsible for communicating effectively. If the customer cannot do that, there\u2019s only so much a service employee can do. \n\nAs for your manager\u2026 it\u2019s really odd he responded like that. Ultimately, if you no longer have a job working under him\u2026 consider yourself lucky.
