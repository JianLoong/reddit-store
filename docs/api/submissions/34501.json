I asked him why he was being defensive and he says he wasn\u2019t.

I want to preface that it sucks that educators are very underpaid and massively unappreciated, especially subs and everything in between. It sucks that he can\u2019t do something he loves because there\u2019s no stability in the contracts and budgets are low to begin with. But he also has to consider what\u2019s worth his time in relation to himself and his family. It would be one thing if he were a bachelor and didn\u2019t have pressing financial needs, but clearly he isn\u2019t meeting those needs with this job choice. He either needs a second job to supplement this employment choice or he needs an entire career change. It might be scary but he needs to grow up and step up because you\u2019re going to burn out more and more each time you dig him out of the hole.", "NTA\n\nIt feels unreliable because it is unreliable. Unfortunately, you can't make him care. Do what you have to do to see to your own future. Ideally he'll do his part and come along with you, but if he chooses not to, you have to either decide to support him or decide to let him go.\n\nYou only have control over yourself. You can't make people want things, no matter how much you love them. If a secure retirement is not important to him, you can't change that.", "NTA - it\u2019s obvious you were triggered and don\u2019t trust him to take care of it. It sounds like previous experiences have you on guard. In fact, maybe he lets you down so often that you\u2019re almost hyper vigilant to it. And he knows that and is triggered as well. He feels immense pressure and you feel the emotional burden of being the sole person that is \u201ckeeping this ship afloat.\u201d Probably a core problem that you go round and round on - and that\u2019s okay. Neither one of you are AHs. If you both can identify your triggers and work on them (individually and together) you may deepen your relationship. He may find himself feeling confident enough to take accountability and you may learn to let go a little \u2014 to trust him. We all have patterns that we need to unlearn, and our intimate relationships give us an opportunity to work them out in a safe space.", "NTA\n\nIt needed to be said.\n\nIt feels like a build up of intense frustration because you've been doing the figuring out for years.\n\nYes, educators & particularly subs are under paid/undervalued.\n\nBut- you absolutely do need a concrete plan.  \n\nSorry to be so blunt, but how can you trust him on this & generally in long term financial planning when he hasn't given you any basis to?", "NTA He absolutely needed to hear it. \n\nEspecially when he does this \"credit cards were opened without my knowledge\"\n\nBeing the solely responsible for both your expenses is a lot of pressure. His lackadaisical approach to finding a stable income *for years* does not inspire confidence in your future partnership planning nor his reliability as a partner. If he can't find a FT teaching position, then supplement it with something else in the meantime.  \n\nIf you get sick, you're both f'd. If you die, he's f'd. If you meet an unexpected big expense (house repair, car trouble, etc) you're both f'd. \n\nWhy is a man with 16x debt, opening cc without your knowledge, and relying on your sole income even asking out loud why he should care.\n\nHe should know that even if you love him now, there might come a time you cannot afford to be married to him, or that the money issues will eat away at that love. It drains a person to live with a partner who doesn't act like it. \n\n~~I don't know how old you are~~ You're in your 30s, if you want kids and other things, iiwiys I'd be setting deadlines as short as months in my head and letting him know. My life cannot depend on how my partner wants to pace his life, nor be saddled with debt depending on his feelings about work. GL!\n\neta: just saw your ages in the title.", "NTA, simply because he\u2019s leaving important matters until the last minute, not communicating with you, and making you feel like the bad guy when you ask.", "How old is you husband? Sounds like someone I know. She graduated college 15 years ago, worked part time job until the nearby University didn\u2019t need GRE to get in. She completed the MA in education along with a teaching credential. She worked as a teacher at 5 different schools who never renewed her contract. She chalked it up with her new innovative ideas. Then she decided to get her MA in Administration so she can implement her ideas as a principal. The school that finally kept her for 2 years said a vice principal position is open but she then turned around and said, it\u2019s too much work and not worth the 1.75x pay raise she would make. She is now working part time as a resource teacher. She has no plans to go full time at all. She likes working this way as she lives with her parents and if she continues working, her loans will be forgiven anyway. It sounds like your husband has no plans to work full time as you are the breadwinner. Do you have kids? If not, that\u2019s even worse. Good Lick but you are NTA.", "Unless he has lottery money he's not telling you about, don't know how he thinks things are going to be okay.", "NTA\n\nYour point was entirely valid - he does wait for other people to sort things out for him, and he's not taking responsibility for himself. \n\nMaybe he'll sort himself out if you ask him to sign a postnup waiving alimony and any rights to your retirement.", "INFO -- has he actually been employed all of these years?   Be it through sub jobs rather than something tenured?    \n\nI can't get a sense if there is actually financial pressure or you feel he is underemployed or that he isn't applying for the jobs you think he should?   \n\nYou said he interviewed for a position and got it?   His current assignment has been extended FOUR times and neither of you knows when they extend or for how long?\n\nSo much missing context.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think what you said was wrong. He needs to wake up. I bet you have put off having babies with him because he can't support himself let alone kids.", "And yes, extended four times. He doesn\u2019t have the best memory. He wouldn\u2019t be able to recall the when or how long details off the top of his head. Naturally, I wouldn\u2019t know if he doesn\u2019t. I just know the person for whom he\u2019s subbing is supposed to return from leave soon.", "Yes, he\u2019s been working as a sub, which means there is no income during winter break, spring breaks, and a large chunk of summer. Usually, he\u2019s scrambling last minute to find a summer job. Last summer job paid woefully little to the point that credit cards were opened without my knowledge/ a conversation to pay his living costs. \n\nHe has a graduate degree in what could translate into educational leadership, so it\u2019s fair to say that he\u2019s under-employed.\n\nI\u2019m not that picky. It could be any permanent teaching job with a steady schedule + benefits so I can cut almost $300 of insurance taken out from my paycheck / month just for him. \n\nI also pay most of our other bills. More than half of the mortgage, the water (which is crazy expensive where we live), phone plans, internet, streaming services, car payment, and the large majority of our groceries, and other entertainment expenses. He has his share of the mortgage, the car insurance, and the electricity. \n\nHe also has 16x the consumer debt I do.", "I'm a sub. As a sub, I get paid between 60- 85 dollars per day for a job that runs 8-4 and has a 30 minute lunch and sometimes a 30 minute break. I am fortunate to be a long term sub, so I'm at the high end of the pay scale right now, but there are no benefits, no pay during holidays, and always the possibility you won't get a job on a given day. It makes me a financial burden, especially since I have a grad degree. I was a sahm for a long time, so I'm working for an employment history atm.
