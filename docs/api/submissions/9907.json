He was the best man at his wedding, before we met.\nEven though in the recent years before our wedding, they definitely weren\u2019t best friends anymore and I could count on one hand how often we\u2019d seen them. \n\nDespite this, it was my husbands choice after all & he was asked to be best man. He said yes, but then said he refused to go if he couldn\u2019t bring his daughter. (It was a child free wedding, for a few reasons 1. We would have tripled the number of people had we invited all the kids in our family & friends group and the venue didn\u2019t have capacity. 2. The venue opened right up on to the sand on the beach and they\u2019d had incidents with small kids running off and the venue management strongly suggested no young children).\n\nWe explained this & then he said that his wife wasn\u2019t coming as she had a party to go to instead. He only dropped that in when the whole \u201cno kids\u201d thing arose, and he couldn\u2019t go if he couldn\u2019t bring the 4 year old. \n\nHis mother had offered to watch her, as she was also invited (ceremony only) and said she\u2019d just take her home from there, or not go at all because it was it was more important for him to be there. \nBut he was being an asshole & flat out said he just wouldn\u2019t bother if she couldn\u2019t be there. \n\nIn the end, my husband said she could come but only as long as his mother kept her eye on her due to the safety concerns with the deck and beach access. So we ended up having her at the reception too\u2026 \n\nIt was really awkward explaining her presence to my family, friends, his family etc. everyone was quite good - we told a white lie and said it was unplanned and she had no one to look after her. \n\nHis wife was at some friends birthday thing, bit even a big event - just sent a clear message that she didn\u2019t give a fuck about my husband & our wedding and would prefer to skip it. And get mad that he couldn\u2019t take the daughter. \n\nHe was ok most of the night. Didn\u2019t want to do a speech, but my husbands brother took care of that\u2026 and it was lovely. \n\nI\u2019m just really annoyed that my husband tried so hard to hold on to this clearly failing \u201cfriendship\u201d & feeling like he had to return the favour of making him best man at his wedding.\n\nAfter that he was noticibly cooler, but my husband being the good guy he is made excuses and said he was just having a hard time. We saw him a few times in a few years after, him and his wife split a couple of years after, each time - the convo was the same. Stuff they did as teenagers. Then awkward silences.\n\nHe never seemed to take interest in anything we were doing, never asked questions. I thought maybe he didn\u2019t like me, so I kept a wide berth. I knew my husband wouldn\u2019t tolerate it If it was that\u2026 so I just let it play out. \n\nAfter a while, My husband would send a message here and there - no response or limited response. \n\nWhen we announced my pregnancy 1.5 years ago and when our son was born 10 months ago, not a word from him. \n\nSo he just doesn\u2019t try anymore.
