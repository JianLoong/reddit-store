Don't throw away a 25 year friendship based upon assumptions.", "NTA. He knows what he is doing. I would tell him how you are feeling.", "NTA. This friendship doesn't really feel like it's equal to me. You see him as your best friend hence the best man role and then you don't even get to go to his wedding just the part after. Seems like he isn't much of a friend period let alone a best friend. I would stick to my guns on this and not allow him to be your best man, stick him somewhere in the back and try not to dwell on it and enjoy your day with your future wife. Good luck.", "NTA. At the very barest minimum he owes you an explanation for why you are not invited.", "INFO: How many people are invited to his wedding?", "NTA it sounds like you are more invested in the friendship than he is. Adjust accordingly.", "Have you talked to him?  Does he have a good reason for not inviting you, like it's family only?  I think YWBTA if you don't talk to him before deciding to kick him out of the wedding party.  If he's such a good friend you should at least have the conversation before blowing up the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
