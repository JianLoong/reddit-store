My (30f) sister (33f) lives very close by, less than 10 minutes. I moved a few hours for work 5 years ago, so when her husband got a job offer here 2 years ago it was a nice surprise. We didn't get to meet up much, and we were always like twins so it was great to be able to see her again, plus they're planning to have kids soon so it was nice for them to have a future aunt nearby.\n\nNow here comes the issue at hand. About a week after they moved in to their new home, they invited me over for dinner. When I got there and they opened the door I was pretty freaked out at what I saw, more soecifically what they were wearing. Latex, both of them were in latex clothing. My sister in a longsleeve sundress kind of thing, my BIL in a tanktop and pants, all made of latex. \n\nI didn't really know what to do, and they led me inside. I probably had my mouth hanging open and I'm sure they could tell I was freaked out, so they sat me down. They explained this wasn't anything \"weird\" (not the term I'd use) but just a lifestyle they enjoyed. They like to wear latex in their house, they compared to people who are always nude at home. I had the most awkward dinner of my life, made up an excuse to get out of there, and left early.\n\nSince then I've been to their place maybe three times in total. Every time they were in latex clothes of some sort, always just modeled after regular clothes. I tried to give it chance really, but something about it just makes me uncomfortable. The longest stay was christmas eve and day, and let me tell you exchanging gifts while your sister is in a rubber \"nightgown\" is weird. \n\nThey've been asking me to visit every few weeks for a while now, and finally I decided to stop being polite. I told them they were free to do whatever they wanted in their own home, but that their lifestyle made me uncomfortable. I said they were always welcome in my home (they don't dress like that out of the house) but I didn't feel welcome in theirs.

You tried, even when it made you uncomfortable. You told them after trying, and made it a boundary. They should respect your boundary. You even told them you are ok with them doing whatever they like in their own home, you just don't want to see it because it makes you uncomfortable so for everyone's comfort you will simply not go to their home. The fact that they dress normally (as we'll call it) outside their house means that they are well aware that the vast majority of the people they'd encounter would look at them weird and probably be uncomfortable if they saw clothes made entirely out of latex. They are willing to respect the comfort of the general public when outside their house. They also need to proverbially read the room. While I can respect the idea that you should be able to do as you like in your own home, it's just polite to consider the comfort of invited guests. You wouldn't wear pajamas to a dinner party you host (unless it's specifically a pajama party) because now your guests are going to feel like they are imposing on you since you look ready to relax and go to bed instead of sitting around and socializing. My guess is that what is happening is that they expect their families would simply accept it and put up with it BECAUSE they are family. All of a sudden, one of the people they thought would be supportive and not say anything has spoken up and said something that was not in agreement with what THEY wanted to hear and believe.", "NTA", "You're acting like latex offends your morals.\n\nMaybe they dont like your polyester.\n\nYTA.", "It's weird, yes, but are they covered?

You are NTA regardless of the reasons for their behavior.\n\nThat said, the secondary question (\"Am I being close-minded?\") is harder to answer and depends on their true intent, which may not be something you have access to. You can try to talk to the sister one-on-one and hope that she gives you the full story. As others have said, latex is ***incredibly*** uncomfortable. It's hard to imagine there's anything but a kink at play (especially since it sounds like the outfits are fucking custom made???), but if you don't want to be close-minded, the best way to ensure you aren't is by having an open and honest conversation with the sister and having her explain whatever's happening in-depth.\n\nUnder the presumption that it *is* a kink, they're the AH by a huge, incredibly uncomfortable margin.\n\nUnder the presumption it isn't a kink, you're still not the AH, but neither are they; they're just weird.\n\nUnder the presumption this story is a fabrication to get internet points (or get your creative writing skill on), you're the AH for lying.
