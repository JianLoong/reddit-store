About a week after they moved in to their new home, they invited me over for dinner.

You tried, even when it made you uncomfortable. You told them after trying, and made it a boundary. They should respect your boundary. You even told them you are ok with them doing whatever they like in their own home, you just don't want to see it because it makes you uncomfortable so for everyone's comfort you will simply not go to their home. The fact that they dress normally (as we'll call it) outside their house means that they are well aware that the vast majority of the people they'd encounter would look at them weird and probably be uncomfortable if they saw clothes made entirely out of latex. They are willing to respect the comfort of the general public when outside their house. They also need to proverbially read the room. While I can respect the idea that you should be able to do as you like in your own home, it's just polite to consider the comfort of invited guests. You wouldn't wear pajamas to a dinner party you host (unless it's specifically a pajama party) because now your guests are going to feel like they are imposing on you since you look ready to relax and go to bed instead of sitting around and socializing. My guess is that what is happening is that they expect their families would simply accept it and put up with it BECAUSE they are family. All of a sudden, one of the people they thought would be supportive and not say anything has spoken up and said something that was not in agreement with what THEY wanted to hear and believe.", "NTA", "You're acting like latex offends your morals.\n\nMaybe they dont like your polyester.\n\nYTA.", "It's weird, yes, but are they covered?
