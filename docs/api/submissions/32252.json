{"id": 32252, "submission_id": "189jj8a", "title": "WIBTA If I (A Groomsman) Pretended To Be Sick to Dodge my Step-Brother's Wedding?", "selftext": "So for context, I'm typing this about a week before my SB's wedding. I've never had a great relationship with my SB, in fact we've honestly hated each other ever since our parents got married. My entire life, I've essentially been SB's emotional punchingbag, while my SM made it worse by always taking his side and demonizing me if I ever talked back to him or, god forbid, went to my dad for help instead. I could rant for hours about things I've dealt with thanks to him and my SM, but I'm trying to stay in character limit. I will say though that it got so bad at times that I overheard my SB arguing with SM multiple times when they thought I couldn't hear them, trying to convince her to throw me out of the house when we were teens because he couldn't stand me. I'm convinced she probably would have, if it wasn't for my dad. Despite all this though, I've mostly grit my teeth and dealt with it all for the sake of peace.\n\nCut to today. We're both adults, and my relationship with SB has mellowed out from \"Outright hatred\" to \"quiet tolerance\" ever since he moved out. A few years ago, he met someone nice and ended up getting engaged to her. Surprisingly, he asked me to be one of his groomsmen, and while I didn't really want to accept, I did anyways because I knew there'd be fallout if I didn't. To some extent, I even wondered if this was maybe his way of saying sorry for how he used to be, though he's never apologized directly for anything.\n\nWe're close to the wedding day now, and due to certain events I've been stewing on all that old resentment again. I've never gotten an apology from SB, and the more I think about the wedding, the more frustrated I get thinking about it all. I've kept my mouth shut and tolerated whatever abuse came my way for years, now years later I have to pretend we're chummy and be this man's groomsman for his wedding, as if he and SM didn't make me feel like an unwanted outsider in my own family for years?\n\nI'm honestly debating whether or not to pretend I'm sick on the day of the wedding. I just don't want to be there for someone I honestly don't like. But then I wonder if I'm being petty for blaming him for stuff in the past and not giving him credit for mellowing out in the years since; Apology or not. Plus, I feel like that would be punishing SIL too when she hasn't done anything. And, lastly, I know my dad really wants me to be there to make family memories. It's a big event for him too, especially since he's the best man, and I'm honestly more worried about disappointing him than hurting my SB or SM.\n\nSo, reddit, WIBTA if I pretended to be sick to dodge my step-brother's wedding?\n\nEdit: To clarify what I meant by there being potential fallout if I didn't agree to be a groomsman, since this may or may not affect people's thoughts. I currently live with my family while I finish college. My SM has threatened to kick me out for very minor arguments before, so part of me worried that if I said no and told SB why, this would lead to an argument with SM that would end in me eventually being kicked out or threatened with being kicked out. This also means low or no contact isn't really an option for the time being, for those suggesting it in the comments.", "created_utc": 1701570969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189jj8a/wibta_if_i_a_groomsman_pretended_to_be_sick_to/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The action I could take that might make me the asshole would be faking sickness in order to avoid my step-brother's wedding, especially since I'm one of his groomsmen.\n\n2.) I might be the asshole if I did this, because my brother has mellowed out over the years and he doesn't use me for an emotional punchingbag like he used to. So this might just be me getting petty and resentful for something that's in the past. I could also be the asshole because missing the wedding would effectively be punishing my sister-in-law by extension by causing unexpected problems on her special day, despite the fact she's done nothing wrong to me. Lastly, my dad is really looking forward to this and wants to make memories with us all being one big happy family, and missong the wedding would definitely disappoint him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All you had to say was I am flattered you want me to be a groomsman but I'd prefer to be a guest. Congratulations to you and your fiancee. Instead you agreed to be part of the bridal party.", "YWBTA. You had every opportunity to gracefully decline being a groomsman or even attending their wedding as a guest. They have now planned for you to not only attend but be part of their day and service. It will have an effect on the wedding overall (walking down the aisle, cost of your plate and drinks, etc). I understand there is resentment there from past issues but you should have dealt with that beforehand. \n\nIf you choose to attend, set yourself for success to have the best time possible. Keep in mind that the groom and bride will be busy and you won\u2019t be spending tons of time with them, that other family members or guests will be there as a buffer or for you to enjoy time with including your dad, politely avoid people you don\u2019t get along with, enjoy your time off of work and other life duties, etc.", "YTA if you skip it at this point.\n\nBut also, 100% cool to put in minimal effort + go no contact after the wedding.", "I'm so on your side on this, but YWBTA because you've had a lot of time to say no.  Just go, deal, and then completely cut contact.  I don't care about family memories or whatever.  Your future SIL doesn't deserve the stress and you said you'd be there.  Just do it and then cut these clowns out of your life.", "YWBTA. You took the easy way to avoid confrontation when you accepted, and you're looking at the childish non confrontational way again. You won't be fooling anyone, just go and deal with consequences of your decision, its just one day. Next time be an adult and dont agree to do things you dont want to do.", "I\u2019d straight up ask the groom why he asked you to be in the bridal party given he showed his dislike for you for so many years", "YWBTA.   Attend  , then leave quietly during the reception .  Be honest later if you are still upset.  You should of cancelled when they could get a replacement", "YWBTA if you showed up sick or decided to bail now. Not going doesn't tell him anything about how he treated you before but makes you look irresponsible/ petty etc and wouldn't be the start of a fruitful convo if it were to ever happen. You could also bring things up", "NTA. Here\u2019s what I would do. Just go to the event since it\u2019s so close. The time to cancel has long past. If you drop out now, you become an easier target for SB and SM. Just grit your teeth, let them have their wedding and then distance the next time there\u2019s any contact.", "YTA for not declining  to be a groomsman months ago..You are NTA for having so much resentment and going forward you do not have to play happy family for your father's sake. Go very low contact with them after the wedding. Maybe see a therapist to process all the baggage. At some point you do need to have talk with your dad because he needs to know you are done pretending all was well growing up. Leave the wedding as soon as you are able. If you are going to get \"sick\" do so immediately after the ceremony so you can dip out of family pictures.", "NTA \n\n\nBut... I do think people will think you are if you don't go. Especially the family and SIL. Personally, I think if you can find it in yourself to get it together enough to just do it, it's a few hours, you won't have any backlash or afterward drama and you just get to carry on.", "NTA, but you should have thought about this before agreeing. Since you still live with stepmom, I think pretending to be sick is going to be your best way out without jeopardizing your living situation.", "YWBTA - but so what? He was an ah to you for years. \n\nBut the time for declining was when he asked you. You would find out why he asked, if he\u2019s trying to make amends and It might have been good to get it all out. \n\nI\u2019m a little more confused why he asked your dad, his step dad, to be his best man. Are they that close? How is your dad that close to a guy who made his sons life miserable? Does sb not have a father? \n\nThis guy and his mother actively hated you and wanted to kick you out- did your dad do anything at the time? Other than refuse to kick you out?  Did he try to get your sb to lay off? Did he say anything to your sm? \n\nIm getting weird vibes of sb laying claim to your dad and maybe doing or saying something during the wedding to make it seem like you\u2019re the outsider in this little family, in front of your extended family. ( I\u2019m probably way out of line, but it\u2019s just a weird vibe I\u2019m getting, and I hope I\u2019m wrong)", "NTA\n\nCovid is going around again. What a shame. I heard you can test positive if you take a skinny pink marker and draw a light dash on the test. Also your fever will be quite high if you take the temperature of a light bulb\u2026 or for those rub on your forehead thermometers, use your armpit. \n\nPlease take care. What a shame.", "YTA for even going along with this. Time to stop being a push over and learn how to stand up for yourself.", "YWBTA.. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a grown man, but sound like a kid not able to have a conversation.", "NTA, but you were wrong for not just saying 'No' and why.  Your adult SB needs to realize that you have no relationship and you owe him nothing, including being in his wedding or even attending.  As for your SM, it is time to be an adult and just let her freak out that you aren't doing what she wants.  Talk to your father beforehand, though, and let him know why you won't be in your SB's wedding or even attending.  Don't fall into the lie of 'being sick.'  Bite the bullet and end this drama.", "YWNBTA.  But if you're worried about losing your housing (your dad doesn't sound like a very strong advocate for you) then it may be in your best interest to go.  You best believe she won't buy any story that you're sick unless you're in someone's emergency room that day.", "NTA but your dad is for allowing these two to treat you like this.", "NTA.", "As much as I want to say your NTA here idk if I can because you did say that you would be apart of the wedding. But I also would almost love it if you did pretend to be sick because it sounds like your SB and SM are both jerks. Overall I\u2019ll say YWNBTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Suck it up, and try and have a good time. Hopefully, there's an open bar. Good luck, OP.", "YWBTA.  You\u2019ve made a commitment, and bailing could throw a monkey wrench into the day.", "YWBTA the time to decline has passed - so he was an AH growing up - stooping to that level isn\u2019t going to change the past. You are also shooting yoirself in the foot here - you live with your father and SM - you think they wont know you aren\u2019t sick? Do you want to live in your car? \n\nWhy don\u2019t you just ask him why he asked you to be a groomsman? It seems odd - if I was him I\u2019d be worried you are going to make a scene.", "YWBTA \n\nIf you didn't want to do this, you should have said no when you were asked. Backing out at the last minute would be a dick move.", "YWBTA. You should have declined the offer ages ago. It will reflect worse on you if you pull out now, and as you've pointed out, your FSIL and dad will be disappointed. Just grit your teeth and go through with it. Don't speak to SB and SM at reception. Mingle with nice guests Have a decent time. Go LC after it's over.", "YWBTA...in everyone else's opinion anyway. I totally understand your reluctance though. I wouldn't want to act all buddy-buddy for any reason with my former stepbrother who was super shitty to me for many years and it would stick in my craw too. \n\nBuuuuut...you mentioned stepmomma wanting to kick you out of the house for other reasons in the past. Do you not think she might get mad enough to go through with that if you dip out of participating in her son's wedding, after you initially agreed to do it? That's totally possible. \n\nIt would really be in your best interests to go ahead and suck it up for a few hours and attend this event. You could always \"get sick\" after the ceremony and a brief appearance at the reception. \n\n\"Not feeling well\" could be your cover for not looking happy and chipper on the day and you could make out like you're doing it for step bro anyway, in spite of your illness. Then after you've powered through the obligatory things and dropped hints here and there that you have a \"stomach bug\", people will more readily accept your not staying for the duration. Pro tip: eating something you know will upset your stomach the night before will definitely help. (For me that would be a big serving of hummus or a couple ears of corn on the cob, lol) People will buy your stomach bug story if you are dashing for the bathroom frequently and stinking it up. If you don't want to do that, a small spray bottle of liquid ass in your pocket for bathroom trips would do nicely. \n\nWho knows...you looking green around the gills and stinking up the bathroom wherever you are might make the people you're concerned about WANT you to go home to \"recover\" without you looking like an asshole at all.", "I'd add 'abuse the bar tab' to the list if it's an option to that 100% cool list.", "And he can always go home after the cake cutting, too. He just needs to make an appearance, sit at the head table, and slip out before the first dance. He doesn't need to party it up into the night.", "He might want to stay sober so he's less likely to say or do something to screw up his living arrangement before he's finished school. \n\nBut do plan on pushing SB into drinking more so he can't perform later and have your cell phone ready to take videos of any sloppy drunks."]}
