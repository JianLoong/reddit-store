I feel like one of us lacks perspective on this, so I am hoping y\u2019all can help. \n\nMy parents are coming to visit us from another state for the 4th of July. I know this always causes my wife stress, just because she wants the house to be spotless when we have people over. Towards this end, we already have a cleaning service scheduled to come in a few days to help get things clean enough so she isn\u2019t stressed out.\n\nYou should also know we have a new puppy and this thing is in the stage of putting everything in her mouth.\n\nNow, normally we\u2019re kind of a bit cluttered. We have people over all of the time and our most common solution to the clutter recently is throwing anything that is a little unsightly into one of our front rooms. We normally just keep the door shut and well, out of sight out of mind, right?\n\nAnyway, one of the items in there has been an artificial Christmas tree. For a couple months we\u2019ve talked about it a few times as something we need to take care of. It was always \u201cwe\u201d need to take care of it. I know y\u2019all don\u2019t know my house, but it\u2019s pretty difficult for a single person to get an object the size of an artificial tree into our attack.\n\nAnyway, yesterday my wife and I go out to eat. Before we order my wife goes \u201ccan you just take care of that tree?\u201d And I was like \u201csure, I will just need help getting it into the attic.\u201d Anyway, after some of the slowest service on record it\u2019s actually pretty late when we\u2019re headed home so I end up telling her I am just going to have to handle the tree in the morning.\n\nWell, morning comes around. My wife reminds me that I said I would do the tree and then tells me she is going to be outside handling some things.\n\nSo, I get up. Handle tree solo and clean up some dog mess, because of course.\n\nAnyway, then my wife comes in in a bad mood and I am trying cheer her up, but I decide not to mention the tree\u2026 because, well, idk. It seemed like it would make her happier to find out later.\n\nAnyway, she just asked me about it and I told her it was the first thing I did today, but she is mad. She says she would have been doing other things in there if I had said something.

I don\u2019t even think it was a lack of communication on your end - I would just cut her a bit of slack because it does seem like she gets very stressed out when your folks are around", "NTA you said you would do it if she helped.....she disappeared do she wouldn't have to help.....so you did it yourself.\n\nBecause of this, she thinks you're the bad guy?\n\nNah!\n\nHowever, if this isn't normal for her, just chalk it up to her being stressed and let it go.", "Sounds like she handles the mental load.

My mom was a everything needed to be perfect for company person and got stressed out because of it.  Life was chaos and totally caused by her even though she'd blame it all on us.  It seems she's just taking her stress out on you in which case makes her the AH not you.  You told her you would do it and you did it.  Tell her she's the jerk for not believing in you.", "NTA, she asked you to do it, and you did it, if she was concerned about \"other things\" she could be asked if you had done it.

My wife of 20 years is used to it by now.", "When my wife (girlfriend at the time) and I first moved in together, we had very different ideas of what \"normal\" looked like for chores. She grew up without a dishwasher, and was used to dishes taking a long time. I had lived by myself, and had a routine of loading (and running if it needed it) the dishwasher every night, then putting dishes away in the morning. She'd do different cleaning tasks on different days, and I would clean everything on Sunday, to start the week strong. There was more than just that, but we really didn't mesh for a few months.\n\nThis may be a similar situation, where you each have a different expected chore routine. Does she regularly tell you chores she did? Is she used to you saying what you've finished? Learning these trends, and even talking about them in plain terms may be helpful for both of you to synchronize better.\n\nIt may also be that she's stressed, and communication is a victim of that. If you have time available to help, looking around for what needs doing is sometimes useful, but I've found it more helpful to ask \"What chore(s) are you not looking forward to doing?\" Then tackle those. There's probably a few that top the list, so keep notes.\n\nNAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
