She grew up without a dishwasher, and was used to dishes taking a long time. I had lived by myself, and had a routine of loading (and running if it needed it) the dishwasher every night, then putting dishes away in the morning. She'd do different cleaning tasks on different days, and I would clean everything on Sunday, to start the week strong. There was more than just that, but we really didn't mesh for a few months.\n\nThis may be a similar situation, where you each have a different expected chore routine. Does she regularly tell you chores she did? Is she used to you saying what you've finished? Learning these trends, and even talking about them in plain terms may be helpful for both of you to synchronize better.\n\nIt may also be that she's stressed, and communication is a victim of that. If you have time available to help, looking around for what needs doing is sometimes useful, but I've found it more helpful to ask \"What chore(s) are you not looking forward to doing?\" Then tackle those.

Why does your wife not rate that common courtesy? \n\nIt sounds like you don't respect your wife's concerns and are only thinking about how you wanted her to help you with the tree instead of seeing the big picture and being a team player here.

I don't know if your wife is the same as me in that regard, but I'm trying to imagine as if I'm your wife.  In this situation, I've already asked you twice to take care of the tree.  Once before ordering dinner the night before, and then again the next morning.  So I don't want to have to ask again.  \nNow, you mentioned you'd need help with getting the tree in the attic, which I'm happy to help you with, but I'm doing whatever I'm doing and not once have you come to ask me to help you.  So I can only make an assumption you haven't done it yet, and that might actually be feeding into my bad mood.  If a long time goes by and now I'm asking you a 3rd time, only to find out it's already done, now I just feel stupid for being in such a mood that I didn't need to be in, and had you just told me it was done, maybe I would've never been in that mood to begin with.  \n\nSo, I could see it being a little triggering. And maybe you'd need to apologize, but so does she for taking a bad mood out on you.   But exiting my imagination and I'm back to being myself now... If this was my husband telling me he took care of something I've asked him to do... I'd feel that weight lifted.  Even if it wasn't a heavy weight thing, I would still feel that sense of relief of an errand or chore being handled.  Even if I was in a bad mood, him handling something, even if I don't find out about it till much later, just makes me feel so much better that it's done!", "NAH thats a stupid argument and I believe she is just stressed.
