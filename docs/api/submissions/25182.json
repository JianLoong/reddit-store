I completely support your decision to not fix it for him.  I have been in your shoes with an ADHD teenager and she had to learn the hard way that it was her responsibility and if she did not like the outcome she needed to figure it out.  Highschool is a serious preparation time for entering adulthood.  This is a good lesson for him.  There is a wonderful program that is called Love & Logic.

In 3 years you will be an adult living on your own.  I know you're excited for the \"freedom,\" but you aren't mature enough yet to understand that you ONLY get freedom when you're responsible enough to handle it.  If you don't turn in your presentations at work, you don't get a detention, you get fired. I have 3 years left to teach you responsibility. I'm sorry if these lessons feel harsh, but you will learn that your actions and inactions all have consequences.  If you don't like it, go get a job and pay your own bills and rent.\" \n\nI hated my dad for it. I balmed him for losing a gf when he grounded me before homecoming.

This is the consequence of that choice. \n\ni'm wondering what the issue is there, and if it can be resolved. Does he feel that you don't understand because you don't have ADHD? What about misogyny? Why does he see an identical action from you as \"nagging\", but not when it comes from his male parent?\n\nThese are questions that need to be answered before he shoots himself in the foot again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
