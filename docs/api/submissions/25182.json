He's now upset because his own stubborn attitude has cost him, but in typical teenager fashion, is trying to blame someone else.\n\nThe real world isn't going to care whether he's got ADHD or not, and this is his first lesson in that.", "What are the odds your son is categorizing your reminders as \u201cnagging\u201d and ignoring them due to misogyny?

You did your part.  His ADHD did not prevent him from completing his task, his ornery teenage stubborn attitude did.  He has to take ownership of the situation.  I completely support your decision to not fix it for him.  I have been in your shoes with an ADHD teenager and she had to learn the hard way that it was her responsibility and if she did not like the outcome she needed to figure it out.  Highschool is a serious preparation time for entering adulthood.  This is a good lesson for him.  There is a wonderful program that is called Love & Logic.  I found it extremely useful when not only raising my kids but using it in the education field I was in.  It is and amazing tool for parents.  Good luck.", "NTA. He's almost an adult, and he needs to learn that actions (and non-actions) have consequences. You're not going to be there to write sticky notes in college, at his eventual job, or in his grown-up life. Your son is mad at you because he's too embarrassed or immature to admit it was his own fault. \n\n It sounds like you really care and aren't doing this to be spiteful or petty. Use this as a teachable moment to bridge the gap from kid to young adult. Eventually, you're going to have to take off the training wheels and hand over the post-it notes. Good luck.", "NTA. \n\nLet me share something my dad once told a teenage me that has stuck with me for almost 30 years since: \"You're welcome to think that I'm mean or tough on you, but you're 15. In 3 years you will be an adult living on your own.  I know you're excited for the \"freedom,\" but you aren't mature enough yet to understand that you ONLY get freedom when you're responsible enough to handle it.  If you don't turn in your presentations at work, you don't get a detention, you get fired. I have 3 years left to teach you responsibility. I'm sorry if these lessons feel harsh, but you will learn that your actions and inactions all have consequences.  If you don't like it, go get a job and pay your own bills and rent.\" \n\nI hated my dad for it. I balmed him for losing a gf when he grounded me before homecoming.  I got our whole extended family to give him shit for it. I was a dumb kid and he was right. His tough love gave me the life skills to breeze through college and grad school and start my own business.  Definitely not the trajectory I was on with my mom's coddling.", "NTA. Your son obviously doesn't respect you. I bet if his dad left a sticky note on his door about the trip to Cedar Point, he would've done it right away. I know people with ADHD tend to forget things very easily, but he shouldn't be blaming you for it.", "NTA - Your son has decided, for whatever reason, to not view you as an authority. This is the consequence of that choice. \n\ni'm wondering what the issue is there, and if it can be resolved. Does he feel that you don't understand because you don't have ADHD? What about misogyny? Why does he see an identical action from you as \"nagging\", but not when it comes from his male parent?\n\nThese are questions that need to be answered before he shoots himself in the foot again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
