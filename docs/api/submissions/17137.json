He does this every payday.

Then maybe his paycheck would be better. Saturday shifts we get paid overtime for the entire shift. The entire time he has worked at this job he has done maybe one weekend shift (the one time he didn't complain about his paycheck). We also only have two people working on Saturdays instead of the regular six people that work during the week. I don't know why the manager still puts him on weekends because we know fine well he won't show up and will call in a replacement.  We are also getting paid well over minimum wage so it's actually good pay. Of course he freaked out on me for pointing out he never shows up on weekends and we all know what he's doing because he tells us all about it on the following Monday. A couple other coworkers agreed with me but some said I should have just left it alone. So AITA?\n\nEdit to add I'm the assistant manager but was acting manager on said day as our manager was away for the day.
