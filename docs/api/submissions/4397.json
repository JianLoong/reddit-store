This should have never been your responsibility to start with. \n\nYour mom is an asshole. She\u2019s infantalizing one child and parentifiying the other.", "INFO: is there any underlying situation that would make it likely that this 9- (almost 10-) year old would require help showering? \n\nBecause without some developmental delay or disability, 9 is well past the age of independent bathing or showering.", "My family doesn\u2019t like it when I lock the door when I shower because I have epilepsy and higher chance of having a seizure in the shower. It runs in the family and my grandma has had an experience where my cousin had a seizure and the door was locked which traumatized her. So she requests that nobody lock the door when they shower not just those of us with epilepsy. But nobody has ever demanded to shower with me or that I keep the door open when I shower. OP\u2019s family is nuts.", "I was showering independently by the time I was 6. I'm a lot older than OP and her sister so there's certainly a generational factor, but come on, an almost ten-year-old should be trusted to clean herself and knows how to call out for help if something weird does happen. It's VERY bizarre to make a 17yo be responsible for cleaning the naked body of a 9yo, too.", "Right?? I started at 6!", "Also, why is it the sisters responsibility and not the Mums?", "In that case, it should not be a 17 year old helping her. And even then, this would be sketchy.", "This is a fantastic recommendation, books like that are *really* helpful for kids that age.", "My 7yo helps her 5yo sister take a shower.  It's really not that hard.", "This is a good middle ground, I don\u2019t really understand the downvotes??", "Yeah, I had two \"puberty\" books and a manners/etiquette book (stuff like \"here is what to do if you have gristle in your mouth\" \"here is how to resolve differences in when you would like to eat\" \"here is how to introduce people\") around that age and they were all immensely helpful and I still remember the illustrations that went with some of the tips.", "EXACTLY where my thoughts went!  Jeanette McCurdy!", "That\u2019s horrible. I wonder why?", "Haven't read it myself, but heard a lot of about her memoir. This is just a whole lot of yikes.", "Depending on age, if a child had an insulin pump, a parent might want to supervise to make sure it did not become dislodged."]}
