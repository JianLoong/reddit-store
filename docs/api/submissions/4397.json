I was curious to know what \"the experts\" said, and nine to ten is the very far end of recommended ages. Some folks said six years old. It depends on the kid, and whether they get themselves clean and rinsed.\n\nFrom my own experiences mothering I veas thinking on the older side, then I remembered that when my daughter was those ages, she took only baths. Because of the possibility of drowning in a tub, gauging solo time there is different.\n\nYou're clear! Do some googling yourself and show all those tiresome elders in your family the results. I'll bet they're still thinking in bath terms.", "1. Why is an almost 10 yr old not showering by herself? 2. Why is it YOUR responsibility??

And this is NOT YOUR KID.", "She's 9 and not deficient and she needs to be bathed? When you have a kid of your own, will you still be supervising baths when the child is 10?

I blame their parents for not preparing them for puberty.", "NTA!  \nBy 9 I was doing my own laundry and had been showering alone for years!  \nWhy is it your job to parent your sister?

It\u2019s not rocket science. Tub or shower..get wet..soap up..rinse..dry off..get dressed. You could certainly check in on her, or just knock on the door, and ask if she needs anything, but to stand vigil and watch her take a bath is a bit much. She\u2019s probably, or will be soon, in Fifth grade. You\u2019ve been coaching her for a couple of months. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s got the hang of it by now.", "NTA, if your mom is so worried about your sister\u2019s shower then she should be the one supervising it.

Once my kid hit 7 or 8 I showed her how to shower and for like a year we would still help her wash her hair but after that? Kid it's on you. Now the fight for me is to get her to shower regularly, since she's a teenager going threw phew-burty. My friends get mad at me and make it sound like I'm abusive for \"forcing\" my child to shower at least 3 times a week and use deodorant every day.

This is so bizarre!!", "This just made me think of the fact that my brother was one of those 9 year olds who did indeed flood the bathroom lol. \nI don\u2019t even remember if he did it on purpose or was just never paying attention but he was always managing to have the shower head the wrong way and the curtain half open so the floor was always a sopping mess. \nBut even then the supervision was just setting up the shower to prevent as much wet mess as possible and reminding him that he had to clean up any water that went outside the tub.", "My nephew just turned 9, and he sometimes needs reminders to wash his nooks and crannies. But that does not mean that someone supervises him while he showers! Whoever is watching him reminds him before he goes to shower to wash those bits, and then asks him if he did when he gets out. That clearly works well enough...he doesn't reek!", "You can ignore your mom. Seriously. This is a highly unusual expectation that a 10-year-old have a supervised bath or shower. I work with kids and by the time they are the age your sister is, they are seeking privacy. Its just an aspect of concrete operational development that begins about the age of 7, after all.

Am I reading this right?", "NTA - i think at this age unless it\u2019s a safety issue, or the child is asking for help, there is no reason to be inside the washroom with her. You can always wash hair in a sink if that\u2019s the issue. Otherwise she should know how to soap herself down.", "NTA - my kids could shower by themselves with minimal supervision from around 2.5 years old (I was present i the room for safety) and wash hair properly from around 4.5.

That's weird. I don't remember what age I started showering alone, but early enough that I only recall needing help with washing my hair. Even that I learned to do before nine, though I probably wasn't as thorough to start off with.", "NTA. You are not lazy, you are sensible. You took your own showers at an earlier age and all was well. Your sister has no disabilities and did fine on her own.

Please discuss this with someone at her school or an unbiased adult.", "What\u2019s your sisters opinion on this? At 10 doesn\u2019t she have any complaints abt privacy?", "I understand if your sister is disabled and is completely unable to shower herself.

You shouldn\u2019t have to do that especially if it\u2019s not even necessary. And everyone needs privacy! I\u2019ve never Im my life have heard of such behavior.
