On the invite we made it clear this was a black tie, adults only event and asked for all RSVPs to be returned by the end of June.\n\nAs is always the case when you put a rule in place, we\u2019ve had people (family and friends) have to decline the invite due to childcare.

Come to this week, we\u2019re less than two months out from the wedding and BIL messages my partner saying they\u2019re having a challenge sorting childcare and are wondering whether an exception can be made for his two small children (6m and 2m) to attend the day. He insists they won\u2019t need an extra seat (though our venue would charge us for children regardless and he did not offer to pay any incurred costs) and to \u2018think about it\u2019.

She felt we were being \u2018unreasonable\u2019 to not ask the venue to accommodate and proceeded to then pass on to BIL that my partner was talking behind his back.\n\nThe brothers are now in a big fight \u2013 BIL feels that my partner is moaning over a \u2018reasonable\u2019 request and that an exception should be made for family, MIL agrees. My partner and myself are not going to budge on this, we don\u2019t want children there because they would disrupt the day and his kids are the exact age that this rule is made to avoid. \n\nAre we being unreasonable?

As for MIL this was a chance to see both her sons and her grandkids even if not at your wedding having them nearby. I am going to try and argue her case more than the brothers cause the brother is being short sighted and selfish. Imagine you are your mother in law, you have 2 children, 1 of whom lives overseas with your grandchildren the second is getting married and because its child free your son from overseas cannot and will not attend and you wont get to see your grandkids or both your children together on a very important day. Even though you know your wrong your going to at least TRY to argue for the selfish reason of wanting your family together doees not make it less selfish but cerrtainly understandable.  \n\n\nYour wedding is child free and should remain so, it is YOUR wedding but it seems like the only 2 options being conscidered are or were find your own babysitter, or do not come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of posts go on reddit from people who have child free weddings but work with family to ensure everyone can still attend by having arrangements made for the children elsewhere or rotating babysitting duty among the parents (and no that is not nescessarily yours to pick up the bill for but it is an option that seems to have not been looked at from your post) not even by family members.  \n\n\nHow would fiance and you react if BIL suddenly said he can come he found a babysitter and you then found out MIL wont be attending because she is babyistting her grandchildren.  \n\n\nGuessing fiance would be hurt and so would you, at least on some level.  \n\n\nIt sucks but its the cost of having a child free wedding or a destination wedding. Your going to offend some family members because they will WANT to be ther ebecause they love yous your your rules are preventing them, yes they should respect your rules if they love you but as a family member being told you cannot attend because of some rule or reason your going to try and fight against the rule or reason. I dont think anyone is trying to ruin your day they just want to be there to celebrate with you, stand your gound but there are other options to be explored that have not yet been explored. Like asking another family member who RSVP'd no due to children can they watch BIL's children on the day for a few hours for him to attend the ceremony at least.", "Info: Is BIL the only guest with children, who was coming from abroad? I generally think you are NTA for setting these rules for your wedding, but leaving kids for the evening with a babysitter and traveling for few days away from the country can be quite different arrangement especially with children that are small (2 year old one). As such, I don't think it was rude for him to ask if he really tried to find a solution and failed.", "NTA\n\nBIL has had 10 months to make childcare arrangements. It\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Clearly the ahole does not care about other people's wishes or request so I would be inclined to return the favor.  Clearly you would not be missing out on anything if this person decided to cut you out of his life and less drama in the future.  I see this as a win-win.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you planned an event. With clear and simple rules. That\u2019s the end of it. You said no children. So no children. No one is the exception and you are correct it would be a slap in the face to every other guest who did manage to find childcare and do as you asked. And it is rude to feel entitled to be special enough to not have to do what every other adult has done.", "Nta\n\nBil had no intention of looking for childcare, in fact, pretty sure his plan *was* to put your fiance on the spot to force him to say yes. You told him long enough ago that he could either find childcare or decline invite, take this as \"decline\", remove him from the seating, and tell him if he shows up that's what happened.", "NTA and I appreciate that you recognize that if people can\u2019t come they can\u2019t come.\n\nMy SIL had a child only event which pretty much only excluded us. We declined and she had the nerve to pitch a fit because we didn\u2019t want to go and pay the expense of 24 hour childcare for 4 days. \n\nMy MIL still goes on about it and will still tell my husband he could have just gone without me. He likes to piss her off and say, \u201cor I could have sent her without me.\u201d\n\nSo no, NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and you can have who you want or don\u2019t want.

My sister does this to me and then my mom comes and scolds me and tells me I am not a good sister or worse. It\u2019s hurtful and has turned what were actual misunderstandings or minor friction into major conflicts. Not even between me and sibling, but me and my parents. I know it\u2019s easy to just vent and hope your parents are on your side, but as you can see in this situation, it just made things worse. Not saying to not tell them anything, but best not to try pulling them into one\u2019s \u201cside\u201d or saying anything that you wouldn\u2019t want repeated.", "NTA", "NTA. Others have put in the effort to find childcare for the period of the year the wedding takes place, which includes other family members as well. It would really be a slap in the face for them if you make an exception. It would sour the mood, and it would negatively affect the relationship you have with those who took the time to find childcare.", "NTA it is pretty entitled for BIL to assume an exception will be made just for his children", "Not to shoot myself in the foot, but you forgot to vote haha! But I appreciate the alternative point of view, thank you.\n\nEDIT: Also to note, it does say in the post but the brothers are now arguing and during that BIL has said he feels an exception should be made as they're family - so they've not entirely accepted the no.", "Thanks so much for taking the time to comment! From my understanding my partner's biggest gripe is how late his brother has left it to decide to ask when he's had the invite for so long and assured him previously it wouldn't be an issue (although these things happen).\n\nMy partner and his brother don't have a particularly close relationship, they will see each other maybe once a year, and there's not a huge amount of effort from either side. Neither have ever expressed having a problem with this set up.\n\nR.e. MIL I said the same thing - I understand why she's biased on this because those are her grandchildren and I imagine she'd love to see them, but that doesn't make it appropriate to then say we're unreasonable in sticking to our guns on the child free day. My sole issue with her is that she took her son venting to her and passed it on which would obviously cause a conflict (to be honest it isn't the first attempt to drive a wedge between them but that's a separate issue!)\n\nI did ask my partner r.e. your question of what if MIL turned around and said she couldn't come as she had to babysit, and his response was that he didn't think he'd be bothered. In all honesty he's currently still angry and questioning both of their invites, I've told him not to do anything drastic.\n\nI completely agree that destination weddings, or inviting guests from abroad, will often lead to logistical problems - we've been told their only options are MIL or the wife's family. If we were pressuring his brother and saying he must attend then I would agree that we need to be offering up some more solutions, but in my partner's view there's three options that he is happy with - they sort childcare, his brother comes alone or they don't attend. If he's happy witht those then I'm happy to stand by him as it's his family.", "Thanks for your input and happy to be told I'm being unfair, I just could never imagine asking somebody to bring my children to a day that was so clearly marked as child free.\n\nThey are the only ones invited from abroad yes - which is why we gave them so much notice and checked in early if there'd be any issues with them coming r.e. the kids. I completely agree nobody wants to leave their very young children in another country, my understanding is they were going bring their children with them and leave them with the wife's family, and it's either become an issue of availability or they've only just realised what the logistics will be (as her family live in our country but quite a few hours drive from where the venue is).\n\nIt sounds like a really difficult situation and we're totally fine if he says only he can come or if neither of them can attend anymore, I just don't think asking for an exemption should ever have been an option.\n\nEDIT: Oh and also not sure if it matters, but as they're coming from abroad we've also paid for on site accommodation for BIL and his wife which we informed them of.", "I agree - I advised not to involve MIL in the issue when the messages were received, my partner chose to vent to her regardless and she (predictably) went to BIL which started  a bigger issue.", "He has a very lucky very understanding fiance, who is advising him correctly in saying don't do anything drastic.  \n\n\nSadly this might end up just being one of those situations where a fight occurs that has no real resolution do not let it be a damper on your wedding or the build up to your wedding.  \n\n\nHe is rite to be pissed at his brother leaving it so late but the fact his brother is argueing so much over it kind of to a degree does show he wants to be there so he obviously cares for you both on some level he also wants his family there. Even if not much effort is put into his relationship with you both. Might not be much but it is something to at least conscider and try to appreciate.(Yes I am giving him the benefit of the doubt that whats important is being at your wedding and not a family get together his children can attend)  \n\n\nWith regards to MIL, I don't know the conversation she had and I dont know how or why she brought it up, but I could easily see a conversation happening were BIL could have called MIL to get her to support him and she said fiance already spoke to me about it and is pissed at you for leaving it so late but I will try and talk to him.  \n\n\nShe is going to talk about family to family, and thats what she did. Depending on who brought the topic up and how it was discussed is what would make me determine if MIL was TA or BIL was TA for trying to involve MIL and your never going to get an answer to that question even if you ask them, cause they are family and are each going to try and protect the other.", "To your last point, there's three sides to every story - in this case MILs, BILs and then somewhere in the middle of that is the truth. My hope in advising to give it some time and let emotions settle, is that by that point BIL may also have calmed down and then be willing to talk it out and settle on the resolution. Emotions always run high when it's family and in this case it may well feel like a bit of an 'us or them' situation, which isn't our intention and hopefully that's eventually seen."]}
