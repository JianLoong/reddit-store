As for MIL this was a chance to see both her sons and her grandkids even if not at your wedding having them nearby. I am going to try and argue her case more than the brothers cause the brother is being short sighted and selfish. Imagine you are your mother in law, you have 2 children, 1 of whom lives overseas with your grandchildren the second is getting married and because its child free your son from overseas cannot and will not attend and you wont get to see your grandkids or both your children together on a very important day. Even though you know your wrong your going to at least TRY to argue for the selfish reason of wanting your family together doees not make it less selfish but cerrtainly understandable.  \n\n\nYour wedding is child free and should remain so, it is YOUR wedding but it seems like the only 2 options being conscidered are or were find your own babysitter, or do not come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of posts go on reddit from people who have child free weddings but work with family to ensure everyone can still attend by having arrangements made for the children elsewhere or rotating babysitting duty among the parents (and no that is not nescessarily yours to pick up the bill for but it is an option that seems to have not been looked at from your post) not even by family members.  \n\n\nHow would fiance and you react if BIL suddenly said he can come he found a babysitter and you then found out MIL wont be attending because she is babyistting her grandchildren.  \n\n\nGuessing fiance would be hurt and so would you, at least on some level.  \n\n\nIt sucks but its the cost of having a child free wedding or a destination wedding. Your going to offend some family members because they will WANT to be ther ebecause they love yous your your rules are preventing them, yes they should respect your rules if they love you but as a family member being told you cannot attend because of some rule or reason your going to try and fight against the rule or reason. I dont think anyone is trying to ruin your day they just want to be there to celebrate with you, stand your gound but there are other options to be explored that have not yet been explored. Like asking another family member who RSVP'd no due to children can they watch BIL's children on the day for a few hours for him to attend the ceremony at least.", "Info: Is BIL the only guest with children, who was coming from abroad? I generally think you are NTA for setting these rules for your wedding, but leaving kids for the evening with a babysitter and traveling for few days away from the country can be quite different arrangement especially with children that are small (2 year old one). As such, I don't think it was rude for him to ask if he really tried to find a solution and failed.", "NTA\n\nBIL has had 10 months to make childcare arrangements. It\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Clearly the ahole does not care about other people's wishes or request so I would be inclined to return the favor.

With clear and simple rules. That\u2019s the end of it. You said no children. So no children. No one is the exception and you are correct it would be a slap in the face to every other guest who did manage to find childcare and do as you asked. And it is rude to feel entitled to be special enough to not have to do what every other adult has done.", "Nta\n\nBil had no intention of looking for childcare, in fact, pretty sure his plan *was* to put your fiance on the spot to force him to say yes. You told him long enough ago that he could either find childcare or decline invite, take this as \"decline\", remove him from the seating, and tell him if he shows up that's what happened.", "NTA and I appreciate that you recognize that if people can\u2019t come they can\u2019t come.\n\nMy SIL had a child only event which pretty much only excluded us. We declined and she had the nerve to pitch a fit because we didn\u2019t want to go and pay the expense of 24 hour childcare for 4 days. \n\nMy MIL still goes on about it and will still tell my husband he could have just gone without me. He likes to piss her off and say, \u201cor I could have sent her without me.\u201d\n\nSo no, NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and you can have who you want or don\u2019t want.

My sister does this to me and then my mom comes and scolds me and tells me I am not a good sister or worse. It\u2019s hurtful and has turned what were actual misunderstandings or minor friction into major conflicts. Not even between me and sibling, but me and my parents. I know it\u2019s easy to just vent and hope your parents are on your side, but as you can see in this situation, it just made things worse.

But I appreciate the alternative point of view, thank you.\n\nEDIT: Also to note, it does say in the post but the brothers are now arguing and during that BIL has said he feels an exception should be made as they're family - so they've not entirely accepted the no.", "Thanks so much for taking the time to comment! From my understanding my partner's biggest gripe is how late his brother has left it to decide to ask when he's had the invite for so long and assured him previously it wouldn't be an issue (although these things happen).\n\nMy partner and his brother don't have a particularly close relationship, they will see each other maybe once a year, and there's not a huge amount of effort from either side. Neither have ever expressed having a problem with this set up.\n\nR.e. MIL I said the same thing - I understand why she's biased on this because those are her grandchildren and I imagine she'd love to see them, but that doesn't make it appropriate to then say we're unreasonable in sticking to our guns on the child free day. My sole issue with her is that she took her son venting to her and passed it on which would obviously cause a conflict (to be honest it isn't the first attempt to drive a wedge between them but that's a separate issue!)\n\nI did ask my partner r.e. your question of what if MIL turned around and said she couldn't come as she had to babysit, and his response was that he didn't think he'd be bothered. In all honesty he's currently still angry and questioning both of their invites, I've told him not to do anything drastic.\n\nI completely agree that destination weddings, or inviting guests from abroad, will often lead to logistical problems - we've been told their only options are MIL or the wife's family. If we were pressuring his brother and saying he must attend then I would agree that we need to be offering up some more solutions, but in my partner's view there's three options that he is happy with - they sort childcare, his brother comes alone or they don't attend. If he's happy witht those then I'm happy to stand by him as it's his family.", "Thanks for your input and happy to be told I'm being unfair, I just could never imagine asking somebody to bring my children to a day that was so clearly marked as child free.\n\nThey are the only ones invited from abroad yes - which is why we gave them so much notice and checked in early if there'd be any issues with them coming r.e. the kids. I completely agree nobody wants to leave their very young children in another country, my understanding is they were going bring their children with them and leave them with the wife's family, and it's either become an issue of availability or they've only just realised what the logistics will be (as her family live in our country but quite a few hours drive from where the venue is).\n\nIt sounds like a really difficult situation and we're totally fine if he says only he can come or if neither of them can attend anymore, I just don't think asking for an exemption should ever have been an option.\n\nEDIT: Oh and also not sure if it matters, but as they're coming from abroad we've also paid for on site accommodation for BIL and his wife which we informed them of.", "I agree - I advised not to involve MIL in the issue when the messages were received, my partner chose to vent to her regardless and she (predictably) went to BIL which started  a bigger issue.", "He has a very lucky very understanding fiance, who is advising him correctly in saying don't do anything drastic.  \n\n\nSadly this might end up just being one of those situations where a fight occurs that has no real resolution do not let it be a damper on your wedding or the build up to your wedding.  \n\n\nHe is rite to be pissed at his brother leaving it so late but the fact his brother is argueing so much over it kind of to a degree does show he wants to be there so he obviously cares for you both on some level he also wants his family there. Even if not much effort is put into his relationship with you both. Might not be much but it is something to at least conscider and try to appreciate.(Yes I am giving him the benefit of the doubt that whats important is being at your wedding and not a family get together his children can attend)  \n\n\nWith regards to MIL, I don't know the conversation she had and I dont know how or why she brought it up, but I could easily see a conversation happening were BIL could have called MIL to get her to support him and she said fiance already spoke to me about it and is pissed at you for leaving it so late but I will try and talk to him.  \n\n\nShe is going to talk about family to family, and thats what she did. Depending on who brought the topic up and how it was discussed is what would make me determine if MIL was TA or BIL was TA for trying to involve MIL and your never going to get an answer to that question even if you ask them, cause they are family and are each going to try and protect the other.", "To your last point, there's three sides to every story - in this case MILs, BILs and then somewhere in the middle of that is the truth. My hope in advising to give it some time and let emotions settle, is that by that point BIL may also have calmed down and then be willing to talk it out and settle on the resolution. Emotions always run high when it's family and in this case it may well feel like a bit of an 'us or them' situation, which isn't our intention and hopefully that's eventually seen.", "NTA - but this is probably a good time for your soon to be hubby to learn not to run to his mother to vent for everything. Most of the current drama (it seems) is the result of your MIL sharing gossip and taking sides here. \n\nCan you connect BIL to some of the other guests who have arranged childcare? Or connect him with local resources?", "Going against the grain here, but I think ESH.\n\nI totally respect the decision not to have kids at your wedding and holding everyone to that - if you made an exception for him, you could have expected anger from every other parent there. However, I think it\u2019s unreasonable that the BIL even asking created so much anger. Based on how you wrote it, BIL asked in a polite and reasonable way, and all that had to be said was \u201csorry, no exceptions, hopefully you can find childcare\u201d. I\u2019m of the mind that if people aren\u2019t allowed to ask polite questions without being \u201centitled\u201d, then there would be a lot more hardship in relationships. You never know until you ask!\n\nOn the other hand, like a lot of people have pointed out, BIL had a huge amount of time to work this out and your fianc\u00e9e took the extra step to remind him about the policy, so he is an AH for not being on it.\n\nAnd MIL acting as pot stirrer between the brothers is just petty. I imagine wedding planning is stressful enough, you don\u2019t need MIL taking a firm stance to make sure there will be tension at the wedding (if BIL attends).\n\nI hope the wedding goes well!", " ,So BIL lives in another country, with small children, and presumably all of his family are going to be at the wedding.    It is the brother of the groom.   Honestly, I can't imagine how he would find childcare, unless someone in the country of the wedding helped him.", "YTA\n\nYou've never MET your niblings and you want to ban them from your day? You think TWO KIDS - niblings you've never met - will disrupt and ruin your day? You think ASKING for an exception is rude - when your request is international travel WITHOUT them? \n\nHe asked and asked you to THINK about it. He's obv aware of the rule and clearly INTENDED to follow it. \n\nHonestly you are kind of the worst. It was a reasonable request - meaning he understood it wasn't a clear yes. \n\nYour reaction and description of being so offended by it all ESPECIALLY when you haven't met them is just beyond. \n\nEvery other guest is likely NOT the parents of your niblings and can likely understand that international travel and actual immediate family would get special consideration.

I would be totally offended to learn my child was exclude when you allowed his children to attend.  Nope stand your ground. It is your wedding.  You have set perfectly common and reasonable rules.

Why would she purposely create even more dissention between her sons? Is she really that clueless? Regardless, she's an AH.  \nYou and your fianc\u00e9 are a bit harsh, it's not really \"rude and entitled\" to ask but it would be \"rude and entitled\" if they just brought the kids along. I am 100% in favor of child free weddings but they are travelling from abroad. Maybe you could set them up with a babysitter in town.", "NTA - but have you offered to try and find him childcare near the wedding?\n\nHe's coming in from abroad which means it's not just a one day trip for him. It's probably at least a week for him. It can be hard to find someone to watch your kids for a week or more. \n\nI don't know if it's entitlement or just he would really like to come and is stuck. \n\nIt sounds like you want to exclude him and this is a very good reason to do so.", "NTA", "NTA - Invite the MIL to stay home and watch the grandbabies during the wedding since she's so keen on stirring family drama. Then invite the BIL to stay with them as well and enjoy your wedding free of assholes.", "NTA.  If MIL feels so strongly about it, she can set up some child care with someone she knows in the area.  \n\nIt is rude to even ask - it created exactly the awkward situation you described.  And your MIL is pretty awful for complaining about your partner \"talking behind BIL's back.\"", "Your BIL has known for almost a year that the wedding is childfree. It is very unfair of him to ask to bring his children so close to the actual date, and put his brother on the spot like that. He should just have said \"sorry, childcare fell through, we won't be able to come\" or something like that. This is his problem, not yours.\n\nAnd your MIL is a real treasure. I'd tread very carefully there in the future. \n\nAnd also, if she agrees with BIL, she can stay home and look after his kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you make an exception every single person who had to pay for childcare will be pissed off.", "NTA. \n\nIt's perfectly acceptable to have a child free wedding, and perfectly acceptable for people to not come because of it (not finding child care, having a new baby, etc). \n\nBIL has had a significant amount of time to plan for this, and simply didn't. Your partner handled this correctly and the answer is simply \"no.\" You aren't being unreasonable or entitled, you are planning the wedding you want to have. Think of it this way, every wedding creates ways in which people can't attend; that ranges from a wedding that requires travel that people can't afford, or not being able to get off work or having a competing event that day. You said child free, people can make their choices from there, just like everyone makes choices for every event they are invited to. \n\nNow, the next thing is you have to stop talking about it. You and your partner need to give MIL in particular a firm \"no\" again and also \"we aren't discussing this anymore.\" I'd suggest a joint convo or text (depending on how you all best communicate) that conveys: This is a childfree wedding and we are not making any exceptions, especially this late when other people who are also close to us have not been given exceptions. . BIL, since you are out of the country if you need any help finding child care or anything like that, I'm sure MIL would love to help you out with that. You two are welcome to plan to bring the children to this AREA but the children are not to be at wedding events. This is a childfree wedding, no exceptions, and we need to move on from this discussion. We love you, we don't want this to be an issue that causes fights, and for the last 8 months you have all been fine with our childfree wedding. \n\n And then, do not entertain discussion. And if BIL does bring the children with him on the trip, have some people who will assist if the children magically show up at the wedding. My guess is this was the plan all along- oh just wait until it gets closer and we will just bring the children. MIL probably wants her precious grandbabies at the wedding and they all thought they could guilt you at the last minute. Don't let them.", "Your event, your rules. Especially since this is a formal event. Your MIL clearly favors your BIL and is meddling in things that are none of her business.\n\nYou're not being an asshole by telling them they are being rude. They're also incredibly pushy and selfish to expect you to eat the cost of this.", "NTA.  Expect that he will show up with his children regardless of rules.  If that happens, stick MIL with babysitting off-site or send them all home.", "NTA Your BIL and MIL are big ones though.", "NTA.  Tell BIL neither of you are being unreasonable and it\u2019s fine if they do not come as their children will not be allowed in.", "BIL deliberately stalled with the intention of forcing the issue, bringing in other relatives to try to pressure you into letting him and his kids rule the wedding, irritate guests who abided by your decision, and maybe even encourage a few to bring their kids, too.\n\nAnd behind all of this is MIL, who regdeds your wedding as her private little party with her grandchildren.\n\nNTA, but BIL and MIL are. If I were you, I would rip the scheming MIL a new one and disinvite her and BIL and co., warning her that security will keep her out.\n\nShe f'ed around. Let her now find out.", "I don't understand people who don't invite their family members to their wedding.", "ESH. I've been on both sides of this--I had to deal with special requests for my own wedding and I now have to deal with finding childcare or leaving my family at home to attend weddings in my home country. I'm just getting a sense that you and your future spouse are taking a very indifferent attitude here, rather than being gracious hosts and trying to find a way to make this enjoyable for your most important guests\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHosting a child free wedding and sticking firm to that is totally fine, but it sounds like you've given no consideration to your immediate family in the planning. In your position I would have been working with the BIL all along to help him find a childcare solution. It can be extremely difficult to find childcare in the city you live in, much less in another country. Also letting you know 6-7 weeks in advance that they are having trouble is hardly last minute. You have weeks to figure all this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour BIL sucks for not being more communicative with his family that he was having trouble finding childcare and instead just asking for the exception.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour MIL sucks for stirring the pot rather than jumping in to mediate and/or to help find a childcare solution.", "It is not rude or entitled to ask. It is however rude and entitled to *keep* asking and he should accept the answer gracefully. Maybe he even would have accepted it gracefully--but your fiance \n talked smack behind his back (again I don't personally think asking once is bad so there should have been nothing to talk smack about) and I'm not surprised a big fight broke out after that because your fiance is bringing other family into it and making a big deal of it.\n\nI guess ESH", "I do think OP and her fianc\u00e9 should offer to help the BIL find childcare; since he lives abroad, it isn't really surprising he doesn't have a list of OP-local acceptable babysitters on hand. But that is as far as I think they should go.", "Given that:\n\n\\- BIL lives abroad\n\n\\- OP & her fiance have never even met the kids in the first place\n\n\\- BIL waited until after everything was finalized to make his 'reasonable request' \n\nI'd bet money that MIL just wants to see her grandbabies and was in on this plan all along. A reasonable solution would be for MIL (who lives in the country the wedding is taking place) to find a trusted babysitter among the people she knows for the day of the wedding so that the BIL can bring his kids for the trip, leave the kids with someone who was vetted by their grandmother, enjoy the wedding, and still respect everyone's boundaries. If BIL & SIL are not comfortable with that, then the SIL could stay home with the kids.", "I mean, it's okay that he asked (with the assumption that he really did try and figure out childcare - from abroad would be challenging.).  But it's clear he and MIL figured OP would cave.  So much unnecessary drama.  Pretty sure MIL must know someone who can watch the kids.", "I'm hoping everybody's calmed down a bit in the past day or so and that we can then reach out and get it resolved in a way that doesn't compromise the day we wanted without leaving BIL in a bind!", "Thank you - we're not sadly but appreciate the thought in mentioning it!", "I think that's a balanced and fair response - my partner's anger is probably contributed to by past events and their family dynamics, details that I won't go into for the sake of their privacy, which is probably why his reaction seems OTT from outside.  Involving other parties, MIL or otherwise, was never going to end well!\n\nIn my own case I think I was just amazed somebody would think to ask that when it's so clearly outlined for you. I've not expressed outright to BIL that I found it rude (I did say it to my fiance and would not mind if BIL was told of my opinion) but wanted to understand what general consensus was on it/if I'm in the minority.\n\nThank you!", "His wife's famiy live in our country where the wedding is happening (they're the only ones who live abroad) - I believe they were intending to leave them with the wife's family to attend the wedding, and it's either become an issue of availability as they've just checked or they've only realised now what the logistics will be as her family live quite a few hours drive from where the venue is.\n\nIt is the brother of the groom, but the groom has said he's happy for them to not attend if they can't sort childcare (this was said before the argument) and we'd be fully understanding as it is a big ask. Even now if they had to bow out we'd get it.", "Appreciate your view on it all; not every family has the same relationships so without any context I appreciate the whole niblings dynamic can look unusual. To be clear this rule wasn't to specifically exclude them - about 50% of guests are impacted by this and have decided accordingly what they're doing. My fiance has said he doesn't think BIL is more important than any other guest to make that exception for and we haven't pressured BIL over anything, we understand whatever he decides to do. Kids attending changes the dynamic of the day and it's not what we personally want.\n\nThis wasn't asking if we should change our mind, we won't be making exceptions, just asking if that's unfair to find it rude. The feedback on how this can be perceived is good to know, as it's against the grain of things so far, so thank you!", ">get over yourself\n\nPot meet kettle.\n\nIt's obvious by \"ALL\" your aggressive typing in caps and condescending lecture to OP that you are super offended that 2 children she has no relationship with are not her priority on her wedding day.\n\nNot sure where your anger is coming from but I feel like you are projecting different cultural expectations on someone else.\n\nJust because OP has a different expectation that you doesn't mean she is \"the worst\" or lacking in \"empathy\".\n\nHer responses here been very kind and open to considering all judgement even from people like you who included multiple backhanded insults.\n\n >You think TWO KIDS - niblings you've never met will disrupt and ruin your day\n\nLol you are completely right no kid much less 2 have ever in the history of weddings ever ruined a ceremony or event with non stop crying or bad behavior...\n\nI have personally never seen videos of children jumping on the bridal train as she walks down the aisle or kids destroying the cake at the reception.", "To be clear, we as a couple decided we didn't want children attending.", "From the conversations I've seen it's scenario B, which has exacerbated things as they've had the date/timings for so long and are only now looking into it which of course will make it more expensive.\n\nI can't blame MIL for wanting to see her family, I don't appreciate being told we're unreasonable and we'll just have to make this exception.", "In fairness I wouldn't say entitlement from BIL is normal - but the last minute nature of his planning definitely is. He's very laid back under the assumption things will get done and work out. Which is fine in some cases, but we already did our utmost to help them manage this occasion (as we aren't unaware it's a big ask for them to come) and it's still not been looked at until last minute.", "Fair enough, it\u2019s why I asked! Thanks for your verdict - and we\u2019re hoping to sort some options for him when we\u2019re in touch again (at the moment BIL has blocked my fianc\u00e9 so may have to come from me)", "Up to this point BIL has been saying that they had it sorted ( we thought they were leaving them with the other set of grandparents) so we hadn\u2019t needed to, now we\u2019re trying to find out what the situation is so that we can help - we certainly will if he\u2019s keen to attend still and they\u2019re in a tight spot!", "I agree with you, and want to add the mother (grandma) is not being smart about it. If she was honest, the BIL's family could get there a few days prior. Grandma then could introduce them to the neighbor babysitter. The kids could get to know said babysitter, thus everyone enjoys the day of the wedding.", "Totally fair - I imagine the context you and your partner have about BIL is what makes this clearly rude or not. If this is a pattern of his to disregard rules and be bad at organizing his things, I can appreciate that the emotional response would be intensified.", "I also don't think asking is rude. Some people would feel slighted if their brother just assumed the answer was no and didn't try to attend. Some people would prefer the sacrifice of a few kids to the absence of a family member. Not everybody, and no judgment either way, but it's not hard at all to imagine that some people might be mad if bro just said \"couldn't find childcare for this international trip so I won't be at your wedding.\" So how's he supposed to know which option you prefer without asking? Especially since it seems like he accepted the no without causing too much fuss.", "Presence = priority? wtf unhinged a little. \n\nAnyhow not sure what's cultural about being offended by a request made with the understanding it was not going to be a clear yes but also not my problem.\n\nZero angry just astounded people really don't think of others especially immediate family on what is generally a day that celebrates family.", "I can say that sometimes as a parent you think you've got it all worked out and then suddenly you don't. People back out and leave you stuck. It happens all the time.", "They are quite opposite, my partner is very organised, BIL is a lot more spontaneous, so they've clashed before. Fiance asking earlier in the year r.e. childcare was his attempt to try avoid this sort of issue so when it turned out it wasn't sorted after months then the frustration came out - rightly or wrongly.", "Yep that's totally fair! I think my mindset possibly is pretty harsh/black and white when there's a lot of grey areas involved.\n\nI will say that after the request has been declined BIL has gone on to multiple times say he feels exceptions should be made for family, but given that's in the context of arguments between brothers it is hard to know whether it would have continued to be brought up anyway or if that's purely being said in the midst of anger. MIL is the one who's pushed it more, saying 'you'll just have to make this exception'.", "And happy cake day!", "Yep definitely appreciate that, but I think as someone said further down you should then let us know childcare fell through and you\u2019re struggling to sort it - I don\u2019t think asking for the exception should\u2019ve been the first call in that situation. But that\u2019s just my personal view, and think this post has shown not everybody agrees which is fair!", "Gotcha - that makes sense then. If the belief is the BIL failed at getting childcare because he didn\u2019t try earlier enough or perhaps diligently enough, I\u2019d be angry too. And sounds like MIL perpetuates this by having your fianc\u00e9e be the bigger person to compensate for BIL\u2019s poor planning skills.", "i think if any expectations were made this would be a time, BIL lives abroad so he can\u2019t just leave his kids there for multiple days. and their whole family will be at the wedding so he can\u2019t leave the kids there. i\u2019m not saying they should let him bring the kids but i don\u2019t think him asking was rude"]}
