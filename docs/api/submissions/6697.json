I was pretty sure she was going to do this, and it didn't bother me. I waited for her to come back to start eating, and when she sat down I tried to talk to her about her day. She asked if I was trying to make a point. I asked what she meant.\n\nShe asked if I cared that she wasn't going to eat what I made. I said that I didn't and would have it for lunch. She got frustrated, focused on her salad and wouldn't engage with me. After dinner, I said we shouldn't make dinner for each other anymore.\n\nShe asked why I thought that, and I said it's clear that she gets upset when she makes food for someone and they don't eat it. It would be better for us just to make separate meals so we each know we will get what we want and no one's feelings would be hurt. She said it wasn't okay for me to make a unilateral decision about our relationship. I said that I wasn't, but I didn't want to cook for her anymore or have her cook for me if it was going to make her upset. We kind of went round and round on it, until the conversation petered out. She texted me at work Thursday that she was going to make salmon. I decided that if she tried to cook for me I would just let her so she'd feel like she won one over on me and we'd draw a line under this.\n\nShe ended up making salmon only for herself, which I was surprised by, because I was expecting her to try to convince me to have some. I made myself a quick omelette and sat down with her. She asked if I was upset she didn't cook for me, and I said no. Again, she accused me of making a point. She asked if I was going to cook for her Friday, and I said no. She was put out.\n\nFriday she was upset that I made only enough curry for one person and called me greedy. At this point I'm over it all, so I just ignored her.", "created_utc": 1673083469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105kxmz/update_no_longer_cooking_for_my_girlfriend/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Orignial post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10355i9/aita_for_wanting_hot_food/", "ESH.

It's fuckin' awesome.", "You are now literally doing the same thing the gf did, arguing that the desire to eat hot food in the cold is wrong and dumb. Are you actually the gf?", "Mh yes, let's worship our partner like gods for making a salad while it's their cooking day. Because there is nothing more important than the fact that your partner was so absolutely gracious and generous to make you peasant some eatable food while bathing you in her glorious presence. \nHow dare you even think about wanting something warm after a cold day outside you fool? Don't you know your body is hot enough? Don't be ridiculous. \n\nIt's mind-blowing how the comments put her making a salad the absolute pinnacle of love-showing that you are not allowed anymore to have an opinion on what you would have preferred to eat, because her feelings are of course way more important than yours and every word against her food is just him being \"a rude asshole\". If you can't handle that you're not always spot on with what you cooked, you should not be in charge of food.", "What adult person gets upset/offended over someone \"making a face\" which btw usually it is an immediate reaction/consequence of showing feelings in general over another adult that would rather eat something else and STILL remains upset that said adult eats something else? If you ask me OP offered a reasonable solution: each coocks whatever they want to eat that day and no one gets snow-flackey over food. \n\nAnd yes, most YTA comments come from people that are coddling his GF because she is a woman. Reverse the situation where OP is a woman (the one that makes a face when seeing the food and wanting to eat something else and goes and has something else to eat) and the one that guiltrips her over this is a male (her boyfriend). How many would have said that she is NTA and her boyfriend has control issues and is abussive?", "This is so true. My wife hates cooking and any outdoor work, so I do all of that. I absolutely detest vacuuming (I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you why), so she does that and most laundry. It works well!\n\nIf one of us can\u2019t do our chore for whatever reason, the other one sucks it up and does what they usually don\u2019t like to do.\n\nGood relationships are built on what I call the \u201cthree coms\u201d. Communication, compassion and compromise. This posters relationship seems to be lacking in all the categories.", "My husband and I split up the individual chores. He loads/switches the laundry, I put it away. He loads the dishwasher, I put away. I cook dinner, he cleans up after. Even cleaning the cat boxes gets split up. Works for us, feels like we\u2019re each doing the thing the other person hates (I\u2019m too short to reach the bottom of the washer so it\u2019s endlessly frustrating trying to get the last damn sock that just lives down there if I have to do it).", "Reread their first sentence"]}
