I was pretty sure she was going to do this, and it didn't bother me. I waited for her to come back to start eating, and when she sat down I tried to talk to her about her day. She asked if I was trying to make a point. I asked what she meant.\n\nShe asked if I cared that she wasn't going to eat what I made. I said that I didn't and would have it for lunch. She got frustrated, focused on her salad and wouldn't engage with me. After dinner, I said we shouldn't make dinner for each other anymore.\n\nShe asked why I thought that, and I said it's clear that she gets upset when she makes food for someone and they don't eat it. It would be better for us just to make separate meals so we each know we will get what we want and no one's feelings would be hurt. She said it wasn't okay for me to make a unilateral decision about our relationship. I said that I wasn't, but I didn't want to cook for her anymore or have her cook for me if it was going to make her upset. We kind of went round and round on it, until the conversation petered out. She texted me at work Thursday that she was going to make salmon. I decided that if she tried to cook for me I would just let her so she'd feel like she won one over on me and we'd draw a line under this.\n\nShe ended up making salmon only for herself, which I was surprised by, because I was expecting her to try to convince me to have some. I made myself a quick omelette and sat down with her. She asked if I was upset she didn't cook for me, and I said no. Again, she accused me of making a point. She asked if I was going to cook for her Friday, and I said no. She was put out.\n\nFriday she was upset that I made only enough curry for one person and called me greedy. At this point I'm over it all, so I just ignored her.", "created_utc": 1673083469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105kxmz/update_no_longer_cooking_for_my_girlfriend/", "score": 2183, "replies": ["Orignial post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10355i9/aita_for_wanting_hot_food/", "ESH.

Sometimes we want something different, and we prefer our own cooking anyway. We generally ask if the other wants in on what we're making, and if not  it's not a big deal.

Now where do we go from here huh?", "She's trying to make some point by being passive-aggressive. Her stating that he unilaterally made a decision is deflecting. He made a statement, that she asked questions about. They could have had more of a discussion, but she went straight to the \"you can't make those decisions for both of us\" card.\n\nIt's possible that there is something bigger going on with her, but if so, she needs to come out and speak about it instead of picking fights over stupid things.\n\nThe gf is clearly the asshole here, and I don't know how you can't see it.", "He didn't expect it of her? Nowhere even in his original post was he being irrational. \n\n\n\n\nIt was her day to cook, she made something, he voiced a mild dissapointment that it wasn't something warm and tried to explain that he had been cold all day and wanted something to warm him up inside. He then decided he'd make himself something else (and didn't make it her responsibility whatsoever) to satisfy that craving. She's the one who got argumentative. She's the one who got mad that he just got up and made himself some soup instead of complaining. She's the one who keeps trying to be petty and make a point after the fact even though he's not being argumentative and standing by the fact that her making meals separate from him doesn't bother him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe decided if she's going to be upset and passive aggressive he doesn't want to cook meals together anymore which doesn't fix the core issue that his girlfriend behaves like a teenager but is reasonable after all this annoyance over food.", "He explained that it got to the point of argument because he kept trying to argue why he doesnt want salad. That was uneccessary. He could have just said he doesnt like to eat cold food on days like this and leave it at that, just heat up a soup. He wanted to prove that he's \"right\" at not liking cold food on a cold day as much as she wanted to prove that it's normal. The difference is that it's something she made, and he made her feel bad about it by detailing how much he doesnt like the idea of eating it.\n\nOP asked if he was the asshole and majority agreed that the way he presented that he doesnt like that food was assholeish. And his comments and further reactions solidified that. That's not an excuse for the girlfiend's behaviour, but the issue started because of his insistence, unearthing a deeper problem on both of their sides. She can't communicate well and instead employs manipulative tactics and he clearly isnt invested in the relationship and is more interested in being \"right\" than to ever make a compromise or empathize.", "There\u2019s a whole paragraph about the conversation they had about it\u2026", "Can I ask what you think chicken salad is?\n\nWhere I'm from it's grilled chicken on salad, so I feel a bit out of the loop on this one.", "She\u2019s going about it the wrong way though.

That was uneccessary. He could have just said he doesnt like to eat cold food on days like this and leave it at that, just heat up a soup.\n\nHow are you seeing \"he kept trying to argue why he doesn't want salad\" as *him* being the one to continue to push the issue? It's pretty clear she was the one continuing to press as to *why* he didn't want the salad. That's even more apparent after this update where he keeps trying to calmly eat his food and she keeps trying to escalate the fight. It was not unnecessary because she made it necessary. \n\n> The difference is that it's something she made, and he made her feel bad about it by detailing how much he doesnt like the idea of eating it.\n\nHe absolutely didn't. Saying he doesn't want to have cold food after a cold day is not detailing how much he doesn't like the idea of eating it, it's literally just expressing a preference. He did not go on a rant about the food.\n\n> OP asked if he was the asshole and majority agreed that the way he presented that he doesnt like that food was assholeish.\n\nYeah, he got absolutely torn to shreds in that post for stuff like \"he made a face\" when we have NO IDEA what kind of face he made. Was it a look of pure disgust? Was it a slight frown? Was it confusion? Making a face just means changing your expression.", ">The difference is that it's something she made, and he made her feel bad about it by detailing how much he doesnt like the idea of eating it.\n\nOh, so... because it's something she made he should lie? Shit like is the exact reason that after years of relationship / decades of marriage when neither party gives a shit anymore you realise you in fact didn't know the person you were with. \n\nFuck lying just to shield someone's feelings. You wanna be soft? Tell you don't like it, and that reason you don't like it is only for you and no one else. If your partner can't handle the idea that you don't hold other people to your tastes or the standards you apply to yourself, maybe you should take a good, long look at your partner. \n\n>She can't communicate well and instead employs manipulative tactics and he clearly isnt invested in the relationship and is more interested in being \"right\" than to ever make a compromise or empathize.\n\nYou say thay so casually as if it wasn't such a big, humongous red flag that she uses manipulative tactics, and as if not enabling narcissists and ignoring them wasn't the best way to deal with their tactics...", "OP made another post before this one.\n\nThe TLDR: They had fun in the snow, came inside for dinner, OP cleaned off coats while GF cooked, OP was given a chicken salad, OP made a face, OP said he didn't want to eat something cold, GF said they are warm enough in the house, they argue, neither accepts the other's POV, OP makes soup for himself, GF is mad, which all leads to this post.", "The size of the effort absolutely matters! She mixed some chopped ingredients in a bowl ffs! That is at most five minutes of effort. Saying that doesn't sound good for any reason isn't dismissive, its the truth and it shouldn't hurt your feelings that it doesn't sound good unless you're A five year old making your first attempt at cooking for your parent! If you get so upset by someone saying they would rather eat something other than your minimal effort that you act like a petty little kid for days you are an asshole. And OP tried having conversations explaining, but she didn't want to hear it. \n\nSometimes I don't feel like eating chilli in the summer. Does my wife care if I say it just doesn't sound good? He'll no, because she's mature enough to understand people can have different preferences. Does she throw a tantrum if I fix myself some boxed mac and cheese instead? Again no, because its what sounded good to me. \n\nAnd who cares if it's just a FEELING? So what if you aren't actually warmer? Your body is tricking you into feeling warmer, which is more comfortable. Who cares if its just an illusion? Are y'all seriously so self centered that OP must suffer because the gf spent a few minutes mixing stuff in a bowl?\n\nAll you people down voting are basically saying OP needs to force himself to eat what's put in front of him. Does he need to finish everything on his plate too? Because that's steps one and two toward eating disorders.
