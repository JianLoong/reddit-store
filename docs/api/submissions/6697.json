I was pretty sure she was going to do this, and it didn't bother me. I waited for her to come back to start eating, and when she sat down I tried to talk to her about her day. She asked if I was trying to make a point. I asked what she meant.\n\nShe asked if I cared that she wasn't going to eat what I made. I said that I didn't and would have it for lunch. She got frustrated, focused on her salad and wouldn't engage with me. After dinner, I said we shouldn't make dinner for each other anymore.\n\nShe asked why I thought that, and I said it's clear that she gets upset when she makes food for someone and they don't eat it. It would be better for us just to make separate meals so we each know we will get what we want and no one's feelings would be hurt. She said it wasn't okay for me to make a unilateral decision about our relationship. I said that I wasn't, but I didn't want to cook for her anymore or have her cook for me if it was going to make her upset. We kind of went round and round on it, until the conversation petered out. She texted me at work Thursday that she was going to make salmon. I decided that if she tried to cook for me I would just let her so she'd feel like she won one over on me and we'd draw a line under this.\n\nShe ended up making salmon only for herself, which I was surprised by, because I was expecting her to try to convince me to have some. I made myself a quick omelette and sat down with her. She asked if I was upset she didn't cook for me, and I said no. Again, she accused me of making a point. She asked if I was going to cook for her Friday, and I said no. She was put out.\n\nFriday she was upset that I made only enough curry for one person and called me greedy. At this point I'm over it all, so I just ignored her.", "created_utc": 1673083469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105kxmz/update_no_longer_cooking_for_my_girlfriend/", "score": 17808, "replies": ["Orignial post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10355i9/aita_for_wanting_hot_food/", "ESH.

Person X does something Person Y and several members of the sub dislike. And there is some highly upvoted comment that basically amounts to \"do the same thing back to person X and they'll see they don't like it!\"\n\nBut the thing is, people are different, and often person X is doing it beacuse it's not a big deal to them. Sometimes I even see that I wouldn't really care if someone/my partner/whatever relationship did that. Not everyone is going to mind the way person Y does. And a lot of the time that bad advice is going to result in this, person X being fine with it and that's why they do it. \n\nThe point isn't \"everyone in the world would hate it if they made dinner and someone ate something else\". The point is \"this hurts girlfriends feelings specifically\" and that matters beacuse OP loves her and cares about her feelings. That's how the conversation needs to be framed. They need to talk and girlfriend needs to explain/OP needs to understand that this isn't about what would make OP feel bad beacuse he wouldn't care. But it can still matter to her, people are different.\n\nLikewise, his reasoning of they won't cook for each other if it just upsets her is silly beacuse it's going to upset her more for them to make separate meals forever side by side. To girlfriend, making group meals makes you feel like a unit/couple/family. And stopping group meals feels like a step back in the relationship, like you are no longer a family/partners but just individual roommates. I would also be pretty sad living with my husband and we just make our own meals (imagine this is before we had kids). And what is the plan if you ever want to have kids? To girlfriend, cooking for someone and being cooked for is a way you should love, connection, and partnership. That's why this is so hurtful for her OP.

I've always envied those people who are able to mask their feelings and can don a poker face.\n\nEven when I **try** to keep a blank face and have said nothing to something I'm not keen on, I've still had people ask with concern whether something is wrong. Apparently my face is an open book....", "I feel like it took two entire posts of me scrolling to find this", "I am neurodivergent. My face sucks sometimes. So I get your point about policing faces. But his attitude matched his face and he was a jerk about it and doubled down at every opportunity. She made a dish she commonly makes for dinner on her turn (per a comment) and he refused to eat it or even apologize for not eating it because it was cold food on a cold day (when he hadn\u2019t expressed a desire for hot food), made soup instead, and refused to do anything damage control, even eating the salad with the soup, apologies, afterwards trying to make up, etc. I think it\u2019s fine he didn\u2019t want to eat the salad, but he did it the worst way possible and said it basically didn\u2019t matter she was frustrated he didn\u2019t eat food she made for him, even though lots of people would feel unappreciated in that case (I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a big deal but lots of people would be bummed). \n\nIt\u2019s not that he made a face to me, but he *knew* he made a face, he refused to eat her salad (when people asked why he didn\u2019t eat some with his soup because soup and salad are a thing, he said her didn\u2019t want any cold food in really curt ways even to commenters; if it\u2019s relevant, this was  a salad *with* cooked chicken and other stuff, not \u201cchicken salad\u201d as you might picture), the tone of his posts and comments was very stubborn and rude like it was obvious he didn\u2019t want cold food and softening for her feeling was out of the question, and he didn\u2019t apologize for the face. \n\nEspecially after the comments on that post, that he couldn\u2019t address her initial hurt here with \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a little stubborn and the miscommunication, let\u2019s talk a little more about dinner from now on\u201d and be cool. (No one is saying he has to choke down a whole meal he doesn\u2019t want, but he couldn\u2019t take a little of her salad or even apologize he wasn\u2019t feeling it and wanted soup etc., explain he understood that she feels frustrated she already made it and he rejected it.) \n\nYes, she\u2019s being petty too but OP got lots of feedback on how to address this last time he also ignored, and to the face he seems to be conscious of this (he brought it up, she didn\u2019t have to tell him about it it seemed like he knew he made it) like a neurotypical person. (I never know what my face is doing and I DO apologize if I make one that hurts someone\u2019s feelings because it\u2019s not my intent!) So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s policing his face as much as his very conscious attitude towards her in the situation and refusal to empathize at all, though he seems to understand how she feel so more refusal to care than any kind of an oblivious thing that could happen innocuously with neurodivergence.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t usually leap to break up, but I feel they should because he honestly must not care at all. If I made my husband frustrated by not eating food he made me, I would apologize even if I really felt I couldn\u2019t eat the food at that time for physical reasons or whatever and got him, it just seemed a stubbornness thing. Like he didn\u2019t get why anyone should be offended (and some people wouldn\u2019t be) so he wouldn\u2019t adjust at all. People like that can\u2019t be in relationships, you have to be able to adjust.

This decision for him to eat something in addition to what she made was a shock for her, implying he normally eats what she makes and vice versa.  But on this one occasion he wanted something hot.

In the the initial post she kept talking down to him about his craving too... \u201cthe temperatures is warm now so you shouldn\u2019t want to eat something warm\u201d as if she is reasoning with a child. Sorry no one is going to talk me out of a craving especially if I am not putting the other person out in satisfying it.
