I was pretty sure she was going to do this, and it didn't bother me. I waited for her to come back to start eating, and when she sat down I tried to talk to her about her day. She asked if I was trying to make a point. I asked what she meant.\n\nShe asked if I cared that she wasn't going to eat what I made. I said that I didn't and would have it for lunch. She got frustrated, focused on her salad and wouldn't engage with me. After dinner, I said we shouldn't make dinner for each other anymore.\n\nShe asked why I thought that, and I said it's clear that she gets upset when she makes food for someone and they don't eat it. It would be better for us just to make separate meals so we each know we will get what we want and no one's feelings would be hurt. She said it wasn't okay for me to make a unilateral decision about our relationship. I said that I wasn't, but I didn't want to cook for her anymore or have her cook for me if it was going to make her upset. We kind of went round and round on it, until the conversation petered out. She texted me at work Thursday that she was going to make salmon. I decided that if she tried to cook for me I would just let her so she'd feel like she won one over on me and we'd draw a line under this.\n\nShe ended up making salmon only for herself, which I was surprised by, because I was expecting her to try to convince me to have some. I made myself a quick omelette and sat down with her. She asked if I was upset she didn't cook for me, and I said no. Again, she accused me of making a point. She asked if I was going to cook for her Friday, and I said no. She was put out.\n\nFriday she was upset that I made only enough curry for one person and called me greedy. At this point I'm over it all, so I just ignored her.", "created_utc": 1673083469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105kxmz/update_no_longer_cooking_for_my_girlfriend/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Orignial post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10355i9/aita_for_wanting_hot_food/", "ESH.

A relationship isn't about who wins or who bests the other or getting one over on the other. It's not a competition. You're both being petty as fuck. If you're in a position to, get some councilling defo as a couple, and if you can individually.", "Just break up already jeez!", "YTA\n\nThis is pathetic. You should have apologised the first time for hurting her feelings. Now you\u2019re just digging yourself a hole. You should just break up since you obviously don\u2019t like her enough to see beyond this silly point scoring.", "This is stupid man. Just put your ego aside and hash it out. It\u2019s not worth deteriorating a relationship over.", "You can stick to your guns.\n\nYou'll lose the relationship, but if it's really worth it to you, keep doing what you're doing.\n\nBut you do realize this isn't about the food *at all,* right? \n\nYou hurt her feelings and showed zero remorse. She's trying to repeat your actions to you so that you can empathize with where she's coming from. Instead you're choosing to go out of your way to keep making separate meals so you can pretend those feelings weren't valid.\n\nAnd you were rude. You should have apologized.\n\nCouples share meals. Maybe not every meal, but most, when they are in the same location.\n\nSo you can keep stubbornly making separate meals (which is obviously not what she wants), but you won't stay a couple. Mostly because it emphasizes on a daily basis how little you care about her feelings. \n\nBut hey, you do you.", "ESH. Dude, it's not about the food. It's about the thought. She made you food, you didn't want it (You could have said it before she cooked it btw) and she was upset she wasted her effort for her. Then the mind games began from both sides.\n\nFor once, be the mature one. Tell her you are sorry you wasted the food she cooked, that you both should start discussing what to eat before cooking and move on.\n\nBreaking up over a salad is really stupid.", "After reading your original post, you're pretty much the AH. If someone makes the effort to make you food, you don't pull your face up and complain. \nI wouldn't want to cook for you again either. \n\nBut on the other hand, your girlfriend is being petty with how she is behaving. Clearly you both don't see eye to eye when it comes to food. Think it's best you both make your own meals from now on.\n\nSo my comclusion:\nESH", "YTA. Your gf is clearly upset about this, even if you aren't. If her feelings matter to you, you need to find a way to make both of you happy.\n\nYou started this fight by making a face when she tried to serve you a chicken salad.

You need to decide if Being Right is worth the damage it is doing to your relationship.", "You both sound so annoying, she keeps deliberately trying to get a rise out of you, and you just keep pretending as though you're being totally reasonable and level-headed instead of just ... talking about it?  \nLike you could have just apologised, explained that you didn't mean to upset her and that you just wanted something warm, but instead you've trapped the both of you in this dumb back and forth. You're insufferable", "ESH. You've both been pretty immature. Judging by your comments it sounds like you aren't happy anymore so maybe better to call it a day?", "ESH. You\u2019re both insufferable.

That\u2019s ridiculous. You didn\u2019t ask her to cook you something else.

You need to talk calmly and find a middle ground.", "ESH on this one but the first incident you were definitely the a h \n\nYou should have apologized and talked it out. It's a logical solution that you should stop making each other food though she's being passive aggressive which isnt right either. You should apologize and explain you aren't trying to win and make a point just that this is the best solution.", "You sound insufferable", "dude either grow up for break up.

What? \n\nThen she accuses you of trying to make a point when that's what she has been trying to do. Let her stew in her own unhappiness, if that's her prerogative.

I can cook and eat whatever I want. She is perfectly allowed to be upset, but that's just not my problem. Life is too short to not eat what you want.", "No one is happy 100% of the time. If this all blows over our relationship might continue to be mutually beneficial. If it doesn't, then I'll break up with her.", "Haaa.  Good one!", "No, because I know why she is upset. She is upset that I didn't eat the salad. She was never going to eat what I made, I already knew that.", "You started the drama, and now you are acting like she is the problem. She is trying to resolve the issue you created. In your original post Reddit called you an *hole. Your update just attempts to ignore the original and rewrite the narrative. She isn\u2019t playing mind games, she is trying to work out a broken part of your relationship. You are a person who will be surprised when she breaks up with you. I can your Reddit post now, my girlfriend dumped me for no reason. Sit down, talk through the situation to resolve it for both side. From both your posts, you are telling her how things will go.

The Iranian yogurt is not the issue here.", "Yeah she\u2019s really manipulative, every way you turn you\u2019re not reacting how she wants and she\u2019s pissy at you.

Sorry.", "A relationship is  a contract. There must be meeting of the minds in order for a contract to be valid. Having said that, there will always be compromises in relationships that will test both parties, which can be superficial, and sometimes goes  to your core. Some are petty, and some are really testy. So choose your battles. Petty things can be a big deal for some if that petty stuff happens  to be their pet peeve. IMO, you were NTA on you first post. And neither are you on this second one. But you seem to be so easily frustrated and ready to move out, in your own words, if she continues her mind games. YTA if you do that. You\u2019re no longer cooking for her, well & good as long as there are no conflicts. She\u2019s no longer cooking for you either, fine.  Too many cooks spoils the broth anyway.", "No, it's not the best way to handle the situation at all.

Cooking separately is not why she is upset.\n\nIt is about the fact that you hurt her feelings and apparently don't give a damn.

Couples can plan the food being cooked in their home. If you'd have told her before she cooked you wanted hot food, rather than expecting her to read your mind. This whole food war would not have happened.\n\nThis is nothing to do with the food.\n\nThis is all because you can't communicate without making it into a mind game.\n\n\nWhen she texted about the salmon, you could have just texted back \"im nit fancying fish tonight, im having xxx\" or \"that sounds great, can you make me some\"\n\nIf you communicated rather than deciding she wanted to upset you, maybe your relationship would be better.\n\nBut no, you've decided she wants to be unhappy.
