When they greeted me, they immediately brought up my career success especially now that my name has gotten a bit of mention and congratulated me. I was unaware that they knew about my career development but they even congratulated. When I pretended not to know Izzy, I wasn't nasty or rude. I just nicely pretended that I don't know who the f-- he is. He works a low wage job and the look he gave his brother was kind of a \"she's snobbing us\" thing.\n\nI'm thinking that I could have just left the supermarket when they showed up and that could have solved everything. Dean and my family aren't close, but I would hate to be a \"she's changed because of money\" narrative in his mind.\u00a0\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
