Needless to say, meals are tough at this house but I usually find something to make that everyone likes. \n\nJaxon recently decided he wants to be vegetarian and that I have to cook vegetarian meals every night. I said no. Doing that would get rid of most meals I can make for James and I don\u2019t have enough time to make two meals (I work until 5:30 and can\u2019t make it in mornings either). He said if I make suppers according to James\u2019s taste I should make some according to his. (He never said he didn\u2019t like the food I make before, he ate everything on his plate without complaint, I know he liked what I made before.) I said it was different, James can\u2019t help his sensitivities and Jaxon can. He still said it was unfair, so I said if he wants it so bad he could make it himself. I would buy some stuff for him but if he didn\u2019t like our food he could make his own. \n\nHe told his dad \u2018Mark\u2019 (we divorced 6 years ago and he only sees them two days a month) and Mark said I was being an AH for only accommodating one kid, and maybe I was in the wrong? I probably could have made meals for Jaxon every few nights but I refused. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: Jaxon knows how to cook, and the side foods I make is usually vegetarian. I try to make foods both kids like but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work.

I am the twin (fraternal) brother of an autistic man. Growing up it was hard for me to feel like what I wanted and who I was always took second place to my brother\u2019s immediate needs. As an adult now I understand he can\u2019t help it while sometimes \u201cI can\u201d but you need to make both your sons feel like they matter. I get that you can\u2019t make two different meals every night but maybe you could have told him you want to support him and talk out some ways to do that without straining either of you overly much. Could jaxon help cook every other night? Could you get him some microwaveable or easy to cook meal stuff at the grocery and tell him to go nuts with it? The important message here is to make him feel heard. \n\nHe will be dealing with his younger brother\u2019s differences for the rest of his life. It\u2019s important to make the fact that you love and care about them both equally clear early on. James will always take extra work, your brother knows that, you know it. He\u2019s only 15 and this may be more of a cry for additional attention and love than about veganism. I\u2019m not a psychologist or a member of your family but that\u2019s my take.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Look around your community and see if there is a vegetarian cooking class you guys could take together. This would get you one-on-one time with him learning something he's interested in. If you don't have any classes available learning together online and cooking a meal together once a week. Would be a very good thing. Kids need individual time from parents. He wants to be heard and valued. He's been very loyal and patient and understanding. Please make time to give attention concentration to his likes and dislikes. After a while of this maybe teach him his brothers dietary restrictions and see if he can come up with a meal that would suit both of them.", "Op there is more at play here than a YTA or NTA, may be your son is acting out to get your attention.

Why not go for the middle ground here; Jaxon cooks some nights but you still cook for him sometimes?\n\nI'm vegetarian and my partner eats meat; it's rare that we have to make two separate meals. He has chicken with something, I'll have haloumi or tofu. It doesn't need to be a battle.", "YTA - Not a massive one though, but \"I probably could have made meals for Jaxon every few nights but I refused\" suggests you're not cooking him meals out of anger. This could be a prime teaching moment for teaching your eldest how to cook, and your youngest trying new foods/textures. A sibling of a child with additional needs will often feel neglected, so making some minor accommodations for him isn't going to hurt.", "YTA. It sounds like your older son is trying to receive equal treatment to his younger brother. How many other times was the younger favoured or accommodated over his brother. I\u2019m sure this is caused by a much deeper issue, and I\u2019d suggest you reflect on how you treat your boys", "YTA because you aren\u2019t finding a compromise to make both your sons feel valued and prioritized. It is reasonable to say you can\u2019t make two meals and reasonable to say that switching full time to vegetarian and working with your other kid\u2019s dietary restrictions is too restrictive. Maybe start with doing some vegetarian meals. Maybe bulk up the vegetarian friendly parts and offer he could also find something to make as a replacement protein if he wanted to add more. But refusing to accommodate him is just going to make him feel like his needs always come after his autistic brother. He will come to resent you and his brother because of it. \n\nFor the record, I do truly believe you are trying your best and that this is a really big ask, if it would require two entirely separate meals.", "When Jaxon grows and goes no contact with you, this will probably be on of the reasons \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yta\n\nIt's annoying but it's not about the food.\n\nThis is a common problem for \"normal\" siblings of special needs kids.

Plus he's 15, show him how to make a few things then he can start cooking meals with you, if this phase of vegetarianism lasts more than a few months Than he can start cooking food on his own as well.", "With great compassion and empathy YTA.  I was a single mother with a daughter who toyed with vegetarianism for a few months and an autistic son who has a very picky palate.  They are now adults but I get where you are coming from.  Single parents never have enough time and cooking twice is panic inducing.  Then toss in a special needs child and you are the walking dead most evenings.\n\nBut vegetarian is not the same as vegan which can be very complex to cook. \n\nYou can make your usual meals vegetarian if you just change how you prepare it.  I\u2019m not talking changing ingredients because, trust me, I know the type of meltdown that can cause, just how you cook it.  Let\u2019s say you make a pasta with meat sauce for dinner.  Instead of adding the tomato sauce to the meat, cook them separately, once the tomato sauce part is done put aside enough sauce for Jaxon and then add the sauce to the meat for you and James.  If you are making baked chicken cook Jaxon a plant based piece of \u201cchicken\u201d but serve the same sides (with meat removed if they have any)\n\nYou can bake Jaxon\u2019s plant based \u201cmeat\u201d at the same time if you buy a small baking pan for Jaxon\u2019s food so the juice and taste from his food doesn\u2019t get onto James\u2019 food.  Because we both know that can induce a autistic meltdown too.  You\u2019ll figure out how to cook your usual menu so that you separate Jaxon\u2019s food before meat is added and it may only add 5 to 10 minutes to your overall cooking time.  A few extra minutes cooking is doable, isn\u2019t it?\n\nBTW, I did not figure this out on my own as I was too overwhelmed by the thought of cooking twice that my mind shutdown.  A coworker who was vegetarian pointed me in this direction and it worked beautifully.  Both my kids ate healthy nutritious meals and I didn\u2019t have to really change up our usual menu.", "YWBTA if you *never* make a dinner that Jaxon can enjoy, but if he's old enough to decide to be a vegetarian, he's old enough to figure out how to feed himself on the daily. NTA", "YTA for not compromising. I think he should help with the cooking/his new diet but you could also take the time to learn to cook some dishes that both the boys would like, or to make a couple of filling and healthy sides that Jaxon could eat while avoiding the chicken/whatever. Mac and cheese, cheese pizza, pasta without meat, rice and veggie casserole, baked potatoes, tacos with beans and veggies, etc. It sounds almost like you want to punish your son for inconveniencing you with his new diet.", "YTA. I dearly wanted to say N. A. H. but you came in with the whole \"your brother can't help it.\" That's not cool. A family has to work together and it can't be all about one kid. It's reasonable for a teenager to learn to feed himself but it's also reasonable for him to expect his parents will sometimes prioritize him. This treatment could result in your sons drifting apart as they grow up. It's kind of serious. At the same time, it's clear you overwhelmed and two separate dinners is a lot. \n\nIs there some convenience food that's an option for the younger brother sometimes? Like on Tuesday and Thursday can he have whatever simple safe food he has that's low effort? In my house that would be PB&J or oatmeal.", "I'll never understand why parents award the child having a meltdown and punishment the child not having a meltdown. I'm a darker, female Jaxon tho, and my bro was lightskinned, male james. he didn't have to eat salad but I did. he didn't have to emotionally regulate all the time but I did. If I asked for anything I was greedy, but for him it was a \"need\". we do not talk anymore. yta.", "YTA\n\nYou make dinner for your whole family based on only one child\u2019s needs but Jaxon now has different needs than his brother. \n\nYou\u2019re telling him that you will cater to his brothers taste but not his and your ex is right that you\u2019re only accommodating one child here. It\u2019s not fair and will lead to resentment.", "YTA for at least not finding a middle ground. Jaxon may not be able to \u201chelp\u201d his aversion to meat or convictions about the benefits of being vegetarian. He can eat dinner minus the meat sometimes, but it seems reasonable that he could cook himself a protein if not a whole dinner. Doing a veggie option for everyone a couple of times a week shouldn\u2019t be a problem, even if it gets repetitive. I would expect that Jaxon has to put up with other things that impact him due to his brother\u2019s needs, so this seems a simple enough area to give him something.", "NTA\n\nA 15yo should be learning how to cook anyhow (and as your 10yo gets older, he should be learning how to cook to accommodate his limitations as well). My 16yo with sensory issues makes his own meals part of the week now.\n\nOnce thing you could do is come to a compromise though--make a vegetarian side that everyone is willing to eat, and have your 15yo make his own main/protein.", "NAH, this is a tough one. \n\nI would guess that Jaxon feels like James\u2019 needs are always prioritized over his, which is pretty common with the siblings of special needs kids. That being said, you\u2019re not a short-order cook and unlike James, Jaxon is old enough to start cooking for himself. Maybe there\u2019s a way to include both boys in the meal prep process? You could gently show James how his food is made, while Jaxson cooks his vegetarian meals alongside you. There\u2019s room for compromise here, I hope", "NAH - I can see both sides. A good compromise would be to spend some time on the weekend with him cooking large batches of vegetarian food that can be frozen in portions and reheated when you don\u2019t have a friendly option on hand. He learns to cook, and you aren\u2019t trying to make 2 meals at 5:30pm after a long workday!", "YTA, but not a big one \n\nYour son is trying to call for your love and attention, because he feels unimportant to you. \n\nThis is a good moment to show union, work with him, not against this.... And just be gentle, because what you're about to do from here on, is the thing he is gonna remember for ever.\n\nIf you can go to family therapy, it will help.", "NTA, I feel for you.  When I grew up it was eat it or don\u2019t. Now I feel like a short order cook accommodating each person\u2019s preferences. It\u2019s too much. Jaxon\u2019s arbitrary new food choices make it harder for you. He can help with the cooking.", "NTA.  I have two sons and the younger one is autistic (no food issues, but I understand some of what you have to deal with).  Accommodations must be made for James for health reasons.  Jaxon is understandably jealous of those accommodations, but he's being unreasonable about this.  Learning to deal with it is part of the process of maturing.  I wouldn't necessarily call Jaxon TA because he's an adolescent and he's going to have to work through this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour ex, OTOH, is TA.  Not only does he spend insufficient time with his sons, he's judging you in absentia.  If he doesn't have \"boots on the ground,\" he doesn't get to have an opinion.  When he's there in the trenches day to day, THEN he will have more grounds to form a proper judgment.", "Nah \n\nYou probably overwhelmed and tired so I understand that you don\u2019t want / don\u2019t have the time to do two different supper.\n\nBut I also understand that it\u2019s your son\u2019s way of asking for a bit of attention and time out of you as he probably feel a bit left out.\n\nSit down with him and try to find a good way to work together. You could do meal prep together on Sunday and prepare a few dishes (or ingredients for dishes like Downshiftology on YouTube does) and mix them up during the week. Researching them and doing them together is going to show your son that you want to be present for him and also give him some great skills for the futur. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other but you three as a team.", "NTA, but there is probably a compromise here by making vegetarian friendly side dishes that Jaxon can eat extra of while avoiding the meat portion. Another option may be a cock pot, I know you said you can't cook in the morning but dumping a few things into a crock pot and putting it on low then leaving it isn't too difficult.", "YTA.  Assemble a couple of vegetarian dishes that Jaxon can prepare as needed. Poor kid has school and huge competition for attention.  Don\u2019t leave him on his own to cook his own dinners.", "I think this is a good opportunity for Jaxon to learn, and for you to teach him. I know you are a single parent, and that comes with a lot of extra work all around (not just at your job, but at home) and the parent of an autistic child is its own thing that I can't address (it's not in my wheelhouse), but maybe this won't be too hard or time-consuming.\n\nIf you have a good solid day off from work every week, maybe turn that into a meal planning and prep day? Jaxon needs to be involved, obviously, and you can make a calendar of meals for the coming week. Prepping ingredients ahead of time (chopping veg, pre-making sauces, etc) and making little index  cards of what to add and when might ease weekday assembly.\n\nIt's something I have done with my own kid, and even though my challenges are different from yours, it has helped our household immensely.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nNAH", "NTA \n\nBuy Jaxon a vegetarian cookbook.

Ie don't fry in animal fat, use separate pans if you can, and explore where you might be able to find crossover meals. Assemble yourself items like tacos, burritos, pizzas are amazing. Pasta dishes where meat can be cooked separately and added will make it accessible for everyone. Swap vegetable stock for chicken base in dishes where you use it. Look up some faux meats and try to have some on hand so he can participate in the main parts of meals, too. \n\n\nHe is a 15 year old boy so he probably doesn't have a ton of cooking experience and will need your help to learn the basics and also help figure out meals, a balanced diet, and more.

But I think your suggestion - especially as at that age I would help my parents (who worked different shifts) with my brother including basic cooking - is reasonable for his maturity and as a \"consequence\" of his choice.\n\nOnce I had handled the basics I stepped up a bit more. Honestly, it was nice to help out the family and learn some cooking skills at the same time! If Jaxon is going to continue being vegetarian he is going to have to learn on his own at some point, so why not now?

As a teenager I became vegetarian because I believed eating meat was was not very sustainable after being shown an energy pyramid in science. My mother made some accommodations like serving two spaghetti sauces or just one cooked without meat and frozen meatballs warmed up in a separate dish.

You could get meals ready to make the work nights easier for everyone.", "People seem to be focusing on James\u2019 textural issues, rather than the fact that he\u2019s allergic (or possibly intolerant?) to specific foods. This is not a picky eater situation. Depending on how his body reacts, we could be talking bowel issues, asthmatic type symptoms (like I have) or even anaphylaxis. OP has a lot on her plate due to James. That said, if Jaxon is vegetarian and not vegan, there\u2019s plenty he can still eat, that can be made gf, although avoiding potato in premade gf is challenging and imagine Jaxon is good with potatoes as a filling vegetarian choice. I think OP should invite Jaxon into the kitchen to help with manning and food prep.", "NAH. I'm autistic and have celiac disease, its hard to accommodate both of those things. But your other son (15) is needing to feel something from you, to feel accommodated too, it might be best to cater to him for a while if you can.", "Normally I'm fully in support of kids learning to cook their own meals, but\n\n>James has a lot of food issues, he\u2019s autistic so he can\u2019t have certain textures/tastes without a meltdown and he\u2019s allergic to gluten (and mango, banana, apple, strawberry and potato). Needless to say, meals are tough at this house but I usually find something to make that everyone likes.\n\nSuggests that this is a cry for attention more than anything else. I'm not gonna call you an AH, but I suggest you reexamine the situation.", "No one stinks. Hes feeling second class. Compromise. Accomodate on weekends and he need to cook for himself on weeknights. Or make wnough that his food lasts thru the week. As a parent of an autistic child i feel the struggle.", "I still cook for my son he\u2019s 22. My oldest is 27. Will always cook for them and serve them.", "NTA, but I wonder if that really is what he is after? Or whether he just wants more attention away from his little brother... You probably need to talk to him more about why he wants to be a vegetarian and how to go about it.", "NTA", "100% NTA.  There will be the \"its so easy to make the adaptable meals\" argument made here all over the place.  SOOOOO easy then the older kid can make his own versions of meals to accommodate his new \" Im a vegan\" phase.", "I let the kids suggest what they want the next day, and if I can make it I will. Plus the side is always salad/gluten-free pasta so he can eat that. Jaxon had foods he didn\u2019t like and foods he did.", "Agreed.\n\nNAH \u2014 I think OP is managing the best that she can and trying to keep her own sanity with a lot going on. However, I think Jaxon also wants to feel accommodated to, which is not uncommon for siblings of those with special needs.\n\nPerhaps y\u2019all can split the week?", "all the more reason to not cater to it.....", "So true.  People on here think it's this big problem with separate 10- course meals every night because \"Someone dares to not eat meat.\"  I love to cook, am vegan and absolutely no one close to me is.  It is so easy to make adaptable meals with the protein switch-out.\nOP is YTA and I so feel for their son.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t read this as actually being about the food and more a cry for attention.", "And this is where our cultures clash, see in our households you eat what your mother made whether you like it or not and if your allergic to it you make YOURSELF something to eat. Doing this for your children only adds to the entitlement that most Americans carry all of their lives. Imagine caving to your child's commands because youre afraid of their meltdowns", "It is seem he wants attention.", "I mean I try not to let James have a meltdown because not only is it stressful for me, it must be hell for him. I\u2019m not \u2018awarding\u2019 him, I\u2019m helping him not be overstimulated by something he can\u2019t help. That\u2019s autism", "Jaxson doesn't have NEEDS- he has WANTS- single parent life can often mean that OP can only do so much. SO much entitlement its mind numbing....", "What is the 'easy compromise' then?  For a single parent who is also navigating raising a special needs child?  Can't wait to hear......", "That's a weird take. I bet he is jealous. It sounds like this isn't the first time he has been told to suck it up because of his brother. He deserves to be taken seriously about his convictions  and not treated as though his own personal development is an unreasonable burden. People have an actual need to be understood and valued within their families. It's weird that so many people are acting like the only two solutions are a 15yo being told to prepare all his own meals or a busy mother having to cook 2 separate meals every day. \n\nAlso, it's kind of nice the kid wants OP to cook. It means he likes her food and feels cared for.", "I told my mom at 7 I wanted to be a vegetarian. She just said no so OP is already leagues ahead being at least willing to provide the supplies necessary to prepare his own food. NTA, maybe if ex husband is so bothered about you not making 2 dinners he can cook it himself", "You cook every day for them? Who's going to feed them when you're not around??", "Does he ever get special meals though, for like his birthday, or is it always catered to his brother?", "Ma\u2019am. Just figure out a way to make it fair. You say 2 night a week Jaxon gets exactly what he wants. Ok. So there are 5 days left. 2 of those days need to be James days because that\u2019s being even. On those days, have a supply of veggie burgers or yogurts some other quick proteins for Jaxon and make the side veggie. He\u2019s old enough to prepare that part himself. And goddamn it, you deserve a day with something easy. The other two days alternate between making a veggie dish that can be easily augmented with meat or having jaxon nuke a protein supplement. \n\nJaxon could, ps, trade a chore for preparing some of the meals that all members of the family can eat.", "Don't listen to these people you're a great parent and trying your best, children don't make the rules you do", "Op needs to fix the cause not the symptom, talking to the kid in a safe space without judgement would be a good start.", "So by your logic the older kid who can cook and accommodate is choice to be a vegan at 15- its so easy to make adaptable meals.   Problem solved and Op NTA.", "But isn\u2019t that exactly what you are doing for James at the expense of Jaxon?  Caving to his picky palate and telling Jaxon to cook for himself?  \n\nps I am not American and did not appreciate your backhanded attempt to insult me via your prejudices.", "OK boomer", "The problem is that James is a tad too young to be preparing his meals to the standards that he likes, and thus 'meltdowns' can have serious health consequences. Some autistic children will not eat the food if they do not like it to the point that they can suffer from malnutrition and poor growth. This is obviously ignoring the fact that some parents will still have the food their child are allergic too and if they don't reconigise (especially with things like gluten) will probably eat it because they dont know its bad. No sane parent would risk that for their children. \n\nMy culture believes in making reasonable adjustment to help people strive in life.", "Which is perfectly normal & I'm inclined to give him a little slack for maybe feeling like he's often invisible when his brother has many more needs. OP's update seems like she's doing her best & the real AH is her ex for putting all of it on her.", "Info. Is Jaxon\u2019s reason for going veggie ethical? If so, how do you think he would emotionally feel having that ignored or forced into ingesting animal products? \nFor convenience might I suggest working on cooking some meals that can be large batched like lentil shepherds pie or lasagna. Easily reheated from frozen. And you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about James allergies as he wouldn\u2019t be eating it.", "Respectfully as an autistic adult, your doing your child no favors by regurgitating the same meals over and over for him never having him try anything new.", "He\u2019s 15, his need is to feel seen and to be as important as his brother", "More likely Jaxson is forgotten son to her and he just want attention from his mother.\n\nHer son will drift from her :)", "Well my 27 moved out already he\u2019s surviving lol. And my 22 yo will most likely starve if I\u2019m not around \ud83d\ude2c", "When it\u2019s a special occasion, I let Jaxon choose the meal and whenever James is gone during supper he picks then as well.", "SO dramatic- parents are not required to drop everything to address every teen attention grab melt down.  The amount of parent shaming here is disgusting.  Jaxson is most likely fine and can come up with a less GRAND way to be jealous of his younger special needs brother.", "Vegetarian, not vegan. She can still use dairy, eggs and honey. Not that hard to avoid adding meat to a dish until after his portion has been dished out.", "I'm not OP idk those people \n\nPs its not prejudice just fact, proven by the downvotes the truth hurts", "I'm literally in my 20s, I was just raised with discipline", "Well then he needs to go about it in a way that his single mom can accommodate.   She isn't a short order cook - 15 is old enough to start communicating that he wants more time. Op NTA", "True, but as some food items can kill his brother and others will just make him starve himself he can take priority in this area. If this is purely about attention she can give him more attention in a different area. If he does want to be a vegetarian they can come to arrangement that on days she has both sons over she will cook him a side dish if he cooks the main part of his dinner. I agree that attention should be split between children with disabilities and their siblings, but areas that can seriously endanger the child is not an area that should be divided.", "What is your suggestion for this single mom to accommodate a ridiculous attention grab in BECOMING VEGAN then?  She has a lot on her plate and her ex is as unsupportive as they come.  Your accusation that one of her children is \"forgotten\" is SO dramatic not to mention irresponsible.  How many autistic children have you raised as a single full time working parent?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  It's amazing to see the down votes but NO ANSWER to the question posted.  Entitlement raging ......", "I'm sure he'll make some poor woman very miserable one day.", "I don't think OP is a bad mother. However by addressing 'every teen attention grab melt down' it stops them from growing. If this continues he can come to resent his brother, especially with dad telling him that he's right for whatever reason. Effective communication is great for reducing building tension and resentment.\n\nAlso, being jealous of special needs siblings is actually quite normal in most cases", "Exactly!  A 15 year old is choosing this and by YOUR account should have no issues adding some food to his plate.  OP NTA.  :)", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think you're confused by words.", "Not in the least bit lol.  You are clearly not seeing that it would be just as easy for this kid to do what you suggested.  It's not on OP to accommodate.  Do you need more help with this?  comprehension can be tough at times.  :)"]}
