We are all in medical school. Even though I'm in med school, I'm also freelancer online. When the pandemic hit, I bought a male and female cat as pets. I didn't neuter them early, and they multiplied to 10 cats. They are neutered now. My family was initially against having pets, but they eventually came around - or so I thought.\r  \n\r  \nNote that I was caring for all of them and paying for all their needs. Not only my cats - I'm paying for all my siblings' allowances, any sudden expenses, groceries, or simply for anything financial-related that my mom can't afford, I would take the hit. Before enrolling in medical school, we were promised financial support by our mother and relatives. However, we ended up having to constantly beg for it, which became exhausting. As the eldest sibling with additional skills in programming, web development, and project management, I chose to work as a freelancer to help our situation.\r  \n\r  \nNow that I'm a graduating medical student, I took a year off due to burnout and relocated to the city to focus on earning money as preparation for internship. I left my 10 cats at home and earnestly asked my siblings to take care of them while I'm away. I believed it was a reasonable request since I made the move for all of our futures.\r  \n\r  \nThe 1 year off wasn't as productive as I thought it would be. While I was profitable, everyone became dependent on me, including my parents.\r  \n\r  \nOne day, I decided to go back home because I missed my cats. I was surprised when I counted them and realized 1 is missing. I kept looking for the missing cat, got worried and asked my siblings about it. At first, no one was talking, until I got angry and said, \"Do you guys think I'm stupid? I am so sure that I have left 10 cats in your care, but when I came back there are only 9 left?\"\r  \n\r  \nEventually, my brother confessed that he has given away 1 cat to his classmate. He said he took pity on them, because their population is too much and they would be better off with someone who can take better care of them.\r  \n\r  \nI was in shock. When did he have the right to give away 1 of MY cats? How did this happen when I'M THE ONE paying for my pets' needs? Why was my cat given away without MY permission?\r  \n\r  \nI cried and sobbed all day. I told my whole family about it but whole family sided with my siblings. They said I am overreacting, that it's just a cat, that I have many cats anyway. No one sided with me, nor understand why I'm so upset. I felt lied to, disrespected, betrayed. \r  \n\r  \nAnother 2 months passed. I had to go back to the city then back home a few times.\r  \n\r  \nSurprise, surprise... another cat was given away. When I counted, there are only 8 cats left.\r  \n\r  \nTHEY KNEW I WAS SO UPSET THE FIRST TIME. THE SECOND TIME IS JUST...\r  \n\r  \nMy partner has long mentioned that my siblings don't appreciate what I've been sacrificing for them and at first, I brush off the comments as not true.

I'm starting to believe no one in my family does.", "created_utc": 1684803526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13p9amc/aita_for_not_trusting_anyone_in_my_family_anymore/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were right in saying the cats deserves better. The remaining 8 do too, in fact. You just abandon them to your family for months at a time. You should have found the cats happy loving homes where they could have the attention they deserve. You claim to care so much about the cats, and if you did, you\u2019d want that for them. As for you supporting yourself financially, that\u2019s a different situation entirely. It\u2019s toxic. But YTA for the cat situation. Your family was doing the best thing for the cats. They deserve better than a sporadically visiting owner.", "YTA! You left for a year if I\u2019m reading this correctly? And you made the unreasonable request that your family take care of 10 (10!

It was unfair of you to burden them with the care of ten cats, paid or not, since you gave them no choice ... and unfair to the cats.", "YTA you have ten cats but don't take care of them? Wtf?", "ESH. Because no you should not be single handedly funding your entire family. But you also shouldn't have 10 fucking cats.", "Yes, you are well on your way to becoming the family \"cat lady\".  You had too many cats.  Get over it.

You need to do better regarding the cat situation. Other people are right, 10 cats is too much. You should've been preparing to have people adopt most of them or figure out how you were now going to become a part time cat care taker. Your siblings are ALSO in med school and they didn't even want the cats so it's not fair to expect them to take care of TEN. \n\nHowever your siblings and family are also assholes for just giving away your cats without even so much as telling you. That fucking sucks and especially when you're financially supporting everybody. \n\nI would say you've gotta figure out a better situation for the cats, they deserve better than this and please make sure to spay/neuter any future pets you have as soon as you can.

I was a kid then, maybe 11yrs old so I had no say in anything that happened. But as a past and current cat owner, been a cat owner probably 85% of my life, I would get rid of 8 of those cats and leave you with the two adults. You left these seemingly beloved animals FOR A YEAR. How do you even bond with them? Those aren't your cats at that point, its a burden you've left with your family. On all sides its an asshole move.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nYou expected your siblings to take care of ten cats just because you sent money? Just the fact you never knew one was missing shows how little you cared for them. Not okay. Take care of your animals.", "There are 2 separate situations going on here and I think you're doing yourself a disservice by making them the same thing. \n\n1. You are financially supporting the family as the eldest child. You have worked very hard and sacrificed a lot of your time, money, and life for a family that has become dependent on you even though you have 2 siblings and parents who are presumably capable of working since they were doing it before. This is not sustainable. I'm sure some of your burnout was you carrying the knowledge that you were the only one working, *when everyone should have been working*. For continuing to depend on you so much and not fixing their situation within their means, it's your family who are AH's. You should stop supporting them for your own sake.\n\n2. You created a situation in which your family had to take care of TEN ADULT CATS for an unspecified period of time. Your entire family had to restructure their lives around caring and cleaning up after TEN CATS that they didn't want. That's like two generations of cats you did not responsibly care for, and no matter how much you adore them, *you are not the one taking care of them*. You are not present. You are not feeding and cleaning up after them. Your dwelling is not the one that is suffering damage and smells like cat excrement all the time. Your belongings are not the ones that are covered in cat hair. You are not structuring your entire life around them, and you \"\"earnestly asked\"\" your siblings to take care of cats they didn't want when they're ALSO going through med school and are trying to establish their own futures. Were you even paying your family to take care of your cats or did you just assume they would do it? Regardless, in this aspect, you are the AH. You placed an unfair burden upon your family without their consent and didn't give them any kind of concrete timeline for when you would be back to take the situation out of their hands. \n\nSo now we get to the part where they gave away two cats. Two cats that they've been looking after since they were kittens, that they never wanted, that the actual owner has abandoned for multiple months at a time, and who now have people who are willing to take care of them. Your family didn't even sell the cats, they just gave them away. That's how stressed and disgusted they were by the burden you placed on them. Yeah, they absolutely should have told you first about the situation and you guys could have come to some kind of agreement. But I honestly can't blame them for thinking that they had to act in their own self-interest regarding these cats, because they knew you would probably say no and leave them still taking care of 10 cats for time immemorial. I'm honestly astonished that you came back to any cats at all.\n\nLook, you're clearly a very caring person who works very hard, but you are working so hard that you are actually not caring for the things you claim to care about. You abandoned your cats to make money for your family, and you forced your family to take care of 10 cats they didn't want. You need to pick something to actually value. Now at this point in time it looks like you've picked your cats, so congratulations, hopefully you'll be able to focus your efforts and make sure to actually do well by them, and I hope your partner is willing to join you in your life of working so hard that you burn out and need to be taken care of and is also willing to take care of your eight cats at the same time.\n\nOne last thing. My entire comment is undoubtedly coming across harsh but I really do mean it when I say that you are a very caring person. You very obviously have a lot of love in your heart. But people are not going to love the same way you do and expecting them to do so, even when and especially when they are your family, is going to break your heart so many times. Also please accept that you are not going to save everyone even though your entire life has been bent towards saving your family, saving people in medical emergencies, and saving these cats. You can certainly try, but at the and time you have to know *when to let go* and not just in anger, stress, and grief. That's so unhealthy. It is so painful. Please do better for your future.", "NTA. While yes 10 cats is a lot! You are financially supporting your entire family, the least they can do is take care of the cars. Which are low maintenance, prob the feedings & litter are the most time consuming which is nothing compared to working hours at work. They could simply TALK to you and you can come to a compromise or solution. Your feelings are valid, I\u2019d be pissed if someone gave away a loved pet of mine.", "I am going against the grain to say NTA. I actually do think 10 cats is a crazy number of cats but context is everything. OP asked them to look after his cats while he financially supported them. All they had to do to avoid being homeless and having their expenses paid was look after the cats. They were all very happy to take his financial support but not willing to do the one thing he asked in return. They didn't even bother to have a conversation about it with him. They just gave his pets away while sucking his bank account dry. OP's family are ungrateful leeches and they had no right to give away his pets when he was supporting their lifestyle in return for looking after his cats.", "When they were kittens, I brought up the idea of rehoming them to the family. Everyone agreed, except for my mother (who is living somewhere else) firmly protested. I asked the reason, and she says we do not abandon the pets, out of \"pity\". She went on a mad tantrum because of this, to the point that she asks if she will abandon us, her children, and what we would feel?\n\nAfter a few years, part of me still regrets it. Right now though, I definitely cannot give them away as they are now all adults and are attached to me. I already lost the opportunity in my conscience to rehome or give them to someone else.\n\nWhen the 2 cats were given away, my mother comforted me, but at the same time comforted my siblings as well. Up to this day, I do not know who she is siding with, I'm assuming she's not siding with anyone. I had a toxic relationship with my mother way before the cats entered the scene, with these kinds of decisions, tantrums and acting as if her words are law.\n\nI know I'm YTA on this for instinctively obeying her, but I won't anymore.\n\n\\---\n\n**Other details I couldn't add to the original post due to the 3,000 character limit:**\n\nYes, I was irresponsible at first, for not neutering them. It was my first time to take care of animals, and thought I could control it. It's my fault for being ignorant. I have since corrected my mistake and neutered all of them, but I'm left with 10 cats - now 8, after 2 were given away.\n\nWhen I was considering my plan to move to the city and make more money, I brought up my worries to my siblings/family about how I didn't want to leave my cats. I'm the one who took care of them for the past 3-4 years. They will be lonely without me. My siblings told me, that if nothing is done about our financial situation, the future will get ugly - I didn't want the family to be in debt or my siblings stopping medical school.\n\nHence, they eased my worries by saying they will take care of them and I should just go ahead to earn more money. They are stressed out and couldn't study due to our financial problems. I know how big of a mental burden it is, growing up in poverty during my childhood, then having to study medicine, so I empathized with my siblings on that.\n\nBefore I actually move out though,  I didn't think of just ditching my pets. I earnestly asked my siblings if this was okay. Discussed the financial arrangements, essentially telling them I'm doing this for the family. I DO NOT WANT to leave my cats, but given the situation where I am the sole income-earner and supporting them financially, I had to do it.\n\nThe main house was large enough to accommodate 10 cats. But I was still anxious so before leaving them, I hired a couple carpenters and bought materials TO BUILD THEM THEIR OWN MINI HOUSE OUTSIDE THE MAIN HOUSE - IN THE GARDEN, where 10 cats are comfortable to run around. I had it installed in a shaded area, with an electric fan, lights and electric fountain. I had considered hiring a caretaker, but my family thought it's a waste of MY money.\n\nMore info: I was only supposed to leave my pets to my siblings for 1 year. I was supposed to earn more money within that period of time. So I crazily worked 3-4 full/part time jobs to make 5x more the income, both for the present and the future.

Right now though, I definitely cannot give them away as they are now all adults and are attached to me. I already lost the opportunity in my conscience to rehome or give them to someone else.\n\nWhen the 2 cats were given away, my mother comforted me, but at the same time comforted my siblings as well. Up to this day, I do not know who she is siding with, I'm assuming she's not siding with anyone.

Wow. Take all the cats, and cut off the money spigot to the family, or turn it down to a \\*fixed\\* amount that is small enough to be easy for you, not more than a few percent of your income.  If it takes a while to get your living arrangements to make that possible, don't tell the family until you come to get the cats. Then tell them maybe you'll see them for the next holiday, but if they start berating you then you won't visit them again for a year and you'll cut off the allowance entirely.  Then see how that feels and re-evaluate.

Without actually socializing, just bare minimum care of food and litter and water really."]}
