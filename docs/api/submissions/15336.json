I live in a popular student apartment building in a tiny studio that is being shown to potential renters as my lease is ending soon. Initially, I was given a 24-hour notice before the showings. It started off with twice a week, and then to five times a week, and now my studio is being shown daily. Despite the inconvenience, I didn't mind this until my landlord started to encourage the students to ask me questions about my unit. I tell him every time that I\u2019m busy studying and I continuously have to tell the students to not bother me. He started letting student rummage through my closet, cabinet, and even the storage under my bed. One evening he just entered my room without notice to take pictures. Unfortunately, this is all legal as it was baked into my lease agreement.\n\nI started getting paranoid because I wouldn\u2019t know if he brought people into my room when I was out. I would notice things were moved around and my door was left unlocked sometimes. I reached my breaking point when I had to put a sign on my door telling students to take off their shoes, because I noticed shoe prints and dirt all over my carpet and in my bathroom. At the next showing, my landlord tore down the sign in front of me and told the students to just keep their shoes on as the showing would be quick. I\u2019m awful with confrontation so I just stood in front of them smiling until they took their shoes off. After that incident my landlord started to only show my place in the early morning. \n\nAfter re-reading the lease agreement, I discovered that there was no mention of how my unit should smell, so there was no limit to how many air fresheners I could use. So, I purchased a bunch sickly-sweet air freshener of all types, from plug-ins to automatic sprays, and even the one you pop open that has the blue crap in the middle. I placed them throughout my room. As soon as the next showing started, I popped on my N95 mask and I squirted out a thick cloud of strawberry Febreze to seal the deal. The students refused to come in. I continued this for the next three showings, and no one could last more than a minute in my room. Success smelled so sweet, so I went back to the drugstore and bought more. I did have to air out my room every night but it was worth it. \n\nMy building is really old, and the air vents in my bathroom are connected to others, which meant that the fruity scent sort of permeated through the entire building. I am on the 4th floor and people on the 20th floor started smelling my room. Students started texting in the building's group chat about it. The smell became so strong I could smell my room from the lobby. My landlord started berating me with emails accusing me of driving away potential renters.  \n\nWhile my friends found this hilarious, my parents thought I took it too far.

It's an unfortunate by-product of a decision made out of desperation. It would be worth looking into the rental laws in your country/state. In most places, the terms of a lease agreement cannot supercede rental laws, and many places have laws not only preventing landlords from entering your apartment without 24hrs notice, but also requiring that anybody who isn't the landlord must have the tenant's permission to enter. Anything your landlord is doing that prevents you from normal use and enjoyment of your home could also be against the rental laws in your area. A lot of lease agreements have illegal clauses baked into them, so it really is worth making sure you know your rights.", "NTA.\n\nsuper proud of this OP, iv had this issue before so thanks for the tip. \n\nyes your petty for this but the games the game.", "Nah your landlord should just file for eviction.", "YTA you're being very petty. Why do you care about the carpet or anything when you're leaving soon? Don't speak to anyone who comes to view it. You signed the lease, you should have read it properly first.", "YTA I don't understand why you are doing this. The apt needs to be leased and you are being an asshole about it. What is your problem??", "I would have hated you if I was living next door - but could not not admire your solution! :-)", "ESH. Still to things that won't affect other people in the building but still freak out the visitors. I'll give you some ideas. Fill your studio with dildos and signs with political messaging on controversial issues. Stop wearing clothes in your apartment. Have posters with graphic nudity. Turn on your tv and have The Human Centipede and other gross movies playing. Stop washing before people are over so they have to deal with your body oder. Blast weird and objectionable music.", "ESH", "ESH.  Your landlord was out of line, but that was only affecting you.  You have been triggering asthma attacks, migraines, and allergies in your whole building!  You're a major AH!", "So, no vote here.\n\nBut um, there were better ways to do this. First: just because a landlord puts something in a lease and you sign that lease, that doesnt automatically make it legal or binding.\n\nDont know where you are but most places have extra protection for leases. Like if you signed away your 1st child in a lease, a judge would never enforce that. Well, there's usually laws and regulations about showings and landlords entering the apt that override anything tricky clauses the landlord may have snuck into to take advantage of unsuspecting renters.\n\nSecond: just start talking to these students. Tell them exactly what is going on right now. Tell them exactly what is going to happen when it's their turn to move out. Tell them he has been entering without warning and barging into your bedroom. Tell them every problem you've had while you were there. \n\nThird: there's any number of \"shocking\" stuff you couldve done before gassing an entire building lol. I mean, just walk around naked while they are there. (and again, tell them he never warned you and he is a bad landlord).\n\nMight be worth checking with a lawyer or a tenant advocacy group. Law schools sometimes offer free consultations.\n\nGood luck!", "Synthetic fragrance is a major asthma trigger for a lot of people (including myself).

Your landlord probably needs to give you 24 hours notice before entering or showing the space. Every time. I'd start there. ESH.", "ESH, though kudos for your petty response! Personally, I'd ignore the lease and only allow viewings at times to suit you. Tell your landlord that you will refuse any more viewings if he allows strangers to touch your personal property. Tell him no viewings unless you're present, and redirect any questions back to him or the managing agency.

Never let them know when he'd show up and with whom. However my friend and her roommates were a bunch of messy/dirty people. Like you couldn't walk into their rooms as there was stuff everywhere. Dirty smelly dishes all over the house. Dirty bathroom with stains on a toilet and a bath. And it wasn't done to spite the landlord, that's just how they lived. \n\n\nAfter two weeks of that and everyone ghosting the landlord he realized he needed to change his approach.

No screws or holes in the walls or any of that.\n\nPlus any of the hidden cams you can get. Lamps and clocks and phone chargers... Seriously: how would you enforce this?\n\nOr what if you just left you laptop/webcam open and recording? Technically not a security cam. Or there's apps to turn your old smartphones into \"security\" cams. I say \"security\" because those apps promote themselves as more like nature cams or pet cams. And they warn that the system is very much not secure for real emergencies. Again, technically not a security cam.\n\nAnd if you did catch the landlord entering and, i dunno, stealing your laptop on your hidden cam, I dont think an addendum to your lease is gonna matter in the face of footage of the theft.", "why even bother reading the post if your gonna use something that didnt even happen why not just use the info at hand and make a real argument based on the facts and story presented", "Synthetic fragrances are a common trigger for allergies, asthma, migraines, and similar conditions.", "where did he say that happen in this post did i miss something ?", "We don\u2019t have any information that a medical emergency *actually happened* the comment was that OP created the risk.", "> My building is really old, and the air vents in my bathroom are connected to others, which meant that the fruity scent sort of permeated through the entire building.
