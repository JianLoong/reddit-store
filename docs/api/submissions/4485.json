It is the same course, except that one is full time and the other is morning. The full-time one has always been her dream and it's in the capital, so the cost of living is much more expensive. \n\nIt is worth mentioning here that over the years, we always explained to our children that my husband and I would provide them with the basics in college, but they would also need to manage a little (Example: if they want a new cell phone, they can work part-time to get one , as their personal expenses we would pay). \n\nWe sat down with our daughter to talk about housing options etc. \n\nWe were realistic with her: The option of her dreams despite being public is a more expensive cost of living. Because she is full-time, she wouldn't be able to have a part-time job and we would be \"tight\" financially by helping her pay there, so she wouldn't have fun money and she wouldn't have money for other things. The other college is part-time, she can work and it would be cheaper for us, so she wouldn't be so financially tight. \n\nShe asked  about the college fund and we were just like \"?\", because in my country it's not such a common practice, because the best colleges are public and honestly I really don't know where she got that idea, because we never brought it up that. \n\nShe looked shocked by this and started saying that basically we were telling her to choose between going to her dream college but she can never do anything because she doesn't have money left or go to her second option and have more financial freedom. \n\nAnd we agreed, we said it's our reality and although we want to help her with college, we can't spend everything on her while we have 2 more kids and a house to maintain. \n\nShe started to complain saying that due to our lack of financial planning (it is not, because if it weren't for our financial planning, she would never be able to go to that college), that we destroyed her expectations for college and enjoy a little,  that she was being harmed (edited)\n\n I felt offended, although we have financial conditions, this is the reality we can offer if she wants it and she sounded ungrateful. \n\nShe's acting cold with us and I'm lost. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670778156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zizpp5/aita_for_breaking_my_daughters_expectation_of_her/", "score": 875, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is very generous for you to pay her basic living costs. Not all families are able to do that. Is there another option where she could defer for a year and work to save up for college \u2018fun money\u2019 while living with you?", "There's always option 3, she could take a year off and work, save money for her \"dream college\". \n\nOr option 4, earn a scholarship. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're giving her reasonable expectations, and while she isn't happy with it, you can't extend yourself beyond what you can give.", "NTA. The reality of the world she is going to have to learn to survive in is that hard choices exist, you can\u2019t have everything that you want, and sometimes you have to build your expectations off of your own economic reality, and not off things other families are able to do. I went to school with adults whose families paid everything for four year, while being someone who worked multiple jobs both on and off campus. It doesn\u2019t feel great to face other people\u2019s privilege, but that\u2019s life. \n\nShe gets to be disappointed, because this is disappointing. She doesn\u2019t get to be hostile and she doesn\u2019t get to blame you for capitalism.", "NTA, time for your little girl to grow up and realize that sometimes perusing your dream means you need to make sacrifices. You're doing what you can and still have two other children to raise. She has options and if she \"wants it all*, she needs to figure out how to make it work. Welcome to adulthood.", "NTA. It's always tough to hear that you can't have your cake and eat it too, but that doesn't mean that you don't need to be told the truth. And that's what you did here, you told your daughter the truth.", "NTA. She\u2019s acting her age which is understandable. You\u2019ve told her the reality of her situation and it\u2019s up to her to pick the option she prefers. \n\nIt will probably take her a bit if Ime to come to term with the reality of her situation so give her some space.", "NTA\n\nCollege funds aren't a thing where I live either, people either Save up themselves to pay for it (but that's really really uncommon), Work part-time (this is what usually happens), Get grants ect to help with cost of living....or they take out student loans/living costs ect.\n\nYou never said she COULDN'T go to her dream university you were just being realistic with her about the financial situation in regards to her living situation while at school.\n\nIs she able to save up some money before school starts and maybe see if there is any grants she can apply for to help with living costs?", "NTA in my opinion. Its not like you lied and misrepresented what you had stored away, in that case I'd say you'd be the asshole. Is there a reason you guys didn't have this conversation sooner though?", "NTA, you're realistic. Reading your story, I thought that you're Brazilian and I saw a lot of friends in the same situation. (edited)\nStudy full time is complicated and require a lot of money. If you're really Brazilian, your daughter can look for \"scholarships\" that helps full time students to maintain during college, but it's very complicated", "NTA.\n\nShe made an assumption and it backfired. That's not your fault.", "NTA if she wants to go to her dream college so bad then she can take out loans, or secure a job to help pay for school.", "She is feeling entitled to what she invisions as the perfect life for herself, which is common for middle-class 18-year-olds. She doesn't understand yet how much hard work it takes to maintain that lifestyle. Have a serious discussion about budget, expenses and income and decide together what the plan is. Either is doable (and honestly I'd pick the one in the capital, that has more \"opportunities\") if she understands what needs to be sacrificed for the more important stuff.", "NTA. You can only do what you can do. If she wants to go to a particular school so badly, she can take a year off and work to afford it herself.", "NTA.  This is something you've talked with her about before.  You're also not saying she can't go, but that if she does, money will be tight, right?\n\nI'm wondering if there would be other ways for her to bring costs down.  For example, students in the US sometimes work as an RA (sort of like a supervisor/prefect) in a university dormitory so they can get free or cheaper living accommodations.  She may well also be able to work limited hours outside of school as well, such as tutoring high school students who live by the campus.  \n\nShe needs to start researching these options immediately -- and she is the one who needs to put the work into it, not you.  If she really wants to go, she needs to show it by being serious about finding ways to make it affordable.", "NTA, but I hope you\u2019ve learned from this to have this discussion *long* before when you had it with Julia. It sounds like she wasn\u2019t clear on the situation - knowing sooner might have made it a little smoother now. She still might have been upset, but to apply and be accepted, she\u2019s now left knowing that she had to leave that chance on the table. \n\nMy kid is not quite 11, and she and I have already talked about this. She knows what I can pay for (not in dollars because inflation, but instead that we will look at what the top end public schools in my state would cost including room and board - if she wants to go somewhere more expensive than that, it\u2019s on her to earn scholarships or take out loans for the difference), and she can plan and dream accordingly. \n\nIt\u2019s 100% fine to set realistic expectations, but I would set them early as opposed to at the moment of a decision.", "NTA. You have told her how you are able to help. She can accept it or find a different way. My folks paid books, tuition and a fixed amount for living expenses. I had to figure out the budget.", "No, you are NTA and does she know parents are not required to pay for any college education? It is a privilege if you can do that for her. She is acting spoiled and entitled. You gave her her choices. She can choose from that. If she does not like it, well lots of people have it way worse. She needs to suck it up.  But you are NTA.", "NAH, I\u2019d say, but at least NTA. You\u2019re just giving her reasonable expectations, but she also has the right to feel a little upset when her expectations aren\u2019t met. Just give her a little time and talk to her, she\u2019ll come to see you are doing the best you can.", "NAH. If you guys are in Brazil (which it sounds like from the description) there are some options for scholarships... That said most scientific institutions are desperately underfunded and these scholarships have been frozen for a while. If the capital here is UnB there are certain arrangements to make the situation cheaper. There is the pensionato in asa sul which is a cheaper housing option for the ladies, it might help having a bit more cash on hand. If the situation is truly dire the university has accomodation possibilities as well. It's not an AH move to manage her expectations, but you all should do some research regarding her options before flat out refusing her too.", "definitely NTA, your daughter\u2019s expectations are pretty unreasonable. the vast majority of parents cannot afford to cover their children\u2019s post-secondary schooling expenses and she should be grateful you\u2019re able to help! at the end of the day, as long as she applies herself and makes good connections, it\u2019s not going to matter what school she goes to.", "NTA. She can go to her dream school. I have no clue what \"fun\" she thinks she needs to do while in school. I assume there are activities & organizations she can do that are funded by the school. If she thinks it's on you to provide money for clubbing or trips, she's being a spoiled brat. Even at a full time U, she should be able to get a part time job on the weekends, or work during summer break.", "I have mixed feelings about this.\nOn the one side, yeah, you are her parents and you should have prepared any amount you can spare to your kids and their future.\nOn the other hand I imagine your kids never lacked any sort of food, shelter or other important things they would need (not counting phones, toys and other luxuries).\n\nI am tending to say NTA as you provided as much as you can for now and got rational together with your daughter to talk about the situation and the circumstances instead of saying it is to expensive and declining her dream college.\n\nShe has the right to choose now.\nEither her dream college and missing out on \"fun stuff and luxuries\" or another college but having access/time/money to the \"fun stuff\".\n\nNTA \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\nYou did your best and still trying, good parents and a slightly entitled spoiled kid.", "This is about responsibility, not money. Your daughter was planning on her dream, and expected you to be fully responsible for making it happen.  That\u2019s unrealistic, and she must learn that. \n\nIf she wants her dream, she can take responsibility and make it happen. She could look for scholarships.  She could take a year or two to work full-time, and save for her own college fund. Or, she can choose the part-time school. \n\nShe has options, and she is in control of making her own choices. She is incredibly lucky to be in this position. \n\nGrowing up is hard.

But realistically, you can't stop her.\n\nI'd somewhat recommend cutting back her hours in the more senior years - 3rd and 4th year presuming a 4 year degree - but I know folk who got top grades and they worked practically full time on top of \"full time\" study.\n\nMy full time study experience boiled down to the equivalent of working part time with relatively few hours, and it can vary from week to week.\n\nBetween 12 and 18 hours of class contact time (lectures and lab sessions) plus around another 12 hours a week of self study and homework with some weeks being more, but most weeks being less. \n\nUnless full time study in your country is something different, she has time for a part time job to earn her beer tokens. \n\nBut beyond that, you're doing OK.

Don't let them coast by for so long with no idea about how finances work. That's leaving them unprepared for the real world. & I would suggest making it a conversation using tangible examples. \n\nFor instance, as a kid when my shoe size got into \"adult\" sizes, my parents sat me down & plainly said that they can't afford the expensive basketball shoes that I wanted (Jordans) considering how frequent my shoe size was changing. Completely reasonable, but as a 10 year old I wasn't the most understanding. They could get me some shoes (maybe even 2 pairs) from a store like Payless, but if I wanted Jordans I would need to pay for them, meaning I would need to get a job. So 10 year old me thought about it, & then went & got a shitty job for a few hours after school a couple days a week & 1 weekend day. Soon enough I was walking around like a little Jordan/Nike ad with all the shit I bought, as that was all 10/11 year old me spent $ on. Thankfully, I grew out of that & learned how to save $ for proper expenses. & overall I think working as a child was tremendously beneficial for me in many ways, chief among them because it shattered that sense of entitlement early on.\n\nSo I'll lean towards NTA, but if you're expecting your kids to be able to \"act like an adult\" at 18 years old, part of that is teaching them about things like handling finances/managing a budget well before they're 18.", "I'm not sure if I'm getting the wrong end of the stick reading OP's post, or your comment.\n\nFrom my understanding OP is offering to pay basic living expenses - food, bills, and rent ONLY.\n\nTuition isn't mentioned, which I presume to mean that as a public university in OP's country, means that its \"free\". \n\nAnything beyond that, her daughter is expected to pay herself - new phones, nights out, extracurriculars, etc.\n\nWhat they're saying is that if she studies full time, then she won't be able to work and earn her fun money.\n\nBut if she wants to work for her fun money, it's at the lower university.\n\nAnd her daughter is then asking - \"well, where's that savings account for me to have fun at uni?\"\n\nTo which OP is like \"??? what do you mean, were paying all your necessary expenses and the rest is up to you...\"\n\nSo her daughter is now complaining she won't get given fun money. \n\nSo, am I missing something in my interpretation?", "Work study was like a grand or less a semester at my school and most jobs didn\u2019t pay any better than working outside the school. It\u2019s beer money basically", "Can't speak for OP but as I understand the daughter wanted the full university experience, studying and having fun with parties, maybe a car or whatever the girl had in mind.", "I got much more, part was Federal, and the rest was paid by the department hiring me. I got about $10k per semester.", "I did work study at university, which paid for half of my tuition (in the US, uni isn\u2019t free).  That was a big deal.

I don\u2019t understand why she couldn\u2019t work part time at college option one though. Lots of people go to college full time and still work on the side.", "I guess the real ah is the education system for making it so expensive.", "Which is fine, but it's not something OP can fund while paying for her living expenses in a higher COL city. So, she can have her dream school and minimal to no luxuries, or she can have the \"university experience\" at a different university.\n\nPersonally, I'd be over the goddamn moon to have had just my uni fees and living expenses covered. This girl is already incredibly lucky to have parents who are able and willing to make it work even if it would just be food bills and rent.", "Or work over the summer for spending money. That's what I did in college, I had scholarships and loans to pay for school itself and then I saved up like $2,000 a summer to be my spending money each school year.", "NTA - why can\u2019t she work part time if she\u2019s going to school full time ?    \nMANY people have a full time job AND a part time job.     \nI\u2019ve worked full time and had 2 part time jobs.    \nThere\u2019s no reason your daughter can\u2019t do the full time course and work evenings or weekends.    \nIt\u2019s not like full time school is 16 hours a day 7 days a week", "NTA she can work part-time. I did all through university and grad school without any problem. A lot of people do the same thing.", "NTA. Our deal with our kids is that we\u2019d pay for a four year degree at a state school. If they didn\u2019t want to go that route we\u2019d put that amount of money toward another college. We\u2019d also fund a trade school up to that amount. That included books, lab fees, etc. if they chose to live away from home we\u2019d give the X amount toward rent. The choice was theirs but our budget was firm. Post graduate degrees were their responsibility. Not one of them complained, and none graduated with debt which I think gives them a huge advantage. One is pursuing his PhD but is paying for it himself one semester at a time while working full time as a teacher. I think it\u2019s very fair to stick to your budget while still giving her options.", "INFO; is there a community college she could go to first? Less cost, same education. Plus, when she transfers to either school for a bachelors, her gen eds will be out of the way, and transfer students get scholarships most of the time. I did it and worked the entire time (15-20hrs a week) and lived off campus cus it was cheaper than on campus (might be different for other schools, since mine was in the middle of nowhere)", "NTA- tell her to get a student loan like grown ups do. I had to take out >200k for medical school but it is worth it every single day.\n\nExpecting a college fund is entitled.", "Info: why can\u2019t she work part time while going to school full time? Tons of kids do this.", "NTA - you have provided reasonable options. She's just being a crummy teenager. Hopefully, she'll grow out of it. Congratulations on supporting. Whether she knows it or not, you helped her get into her dream school.", "NTA", "I guess it is a dream college. Now for the reality one", "NTA.\n\nI'm of a different mind than most people here, but I also admit that I'm an AH. I grew up with The School of Hard Knocks, and it taught me something important- no one owes you anything, and if you want anything, you not only have to earn it, but accept that earning stuff doesn't necessarily mean you'll get it.\n\nMy suggestion? See if she's adult enough to have an adult conversation with you. See if she wants to be thought of as a child who needs your support, which also comes with rules and restrictions, or not.\n\nIf she thinks she's a full adult, then she can be given an ultimatum- she has every right to choose how to spend her own money that she earns at a job. She can even spend it on a college of her choice, and a rental space of her own choosing to free her of your restrictions.\n\nEdit: There are people I've met (no idea how they do it but they do) that work, go to school, and are the only caretaker of their own space.\n\nThink of 70 years from now, or whatever year it is after you've passed. If she hasn't already learned the lesson this suggestion is trying teach, where will she be?", "NTA\n\nTell her other students get no help whatsoever.", "NTA.  what is it about her dream college makes it her dream? is it the education she will receive there, or is it the social life?  which college will give her the best education for her future. she can always move to the capital after getting her degree from the part time school. then live her best life there on her own dime. this is her education about the reality of life, delayed gratification and finance.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t let her watch American TV. That\u2019s where she learned to be entitled. But TV shoes offer false narrative. Yes some kids have college funds. But most of us don\u2019t. We take out loans to pay for college. And we work part time while being full time student.  It\u2019s the sacrifice she has to make if she wants dream school.", "NTA but being a full time student doesn't prevent someone from working part time. It's possible to have a full time course schedule and a part time job, especially if she can arrange her course schedule to be mostly on the same days. I took five classes at a time in undergrad and still worked 15-20 hours a week because most of my classes were Tuesdays & Thursdays, giving me Mondays and Wednesdays for homework and Friday-Sunday for a part time job.", "this girl sounds unbelievably entitled. i live in the US and my parents aren\u2019t paying for anything regarding my college, which is exorbitantly expensive here. i have to sort out housing, tuition, and needs/wants all myself. i would be so thankful to my parents if they covered my basic living expenses. she needs to be grateful for what she\u2019s being given. NTA.", "NTA. She should be so grateful you're helping  at all! So many people in the world don't have that kind of luxury! \nIt seems so odd to me that she would just assume you had a college fund for her when you've never mentioned anything about one.  Where you're from (culture/country/economic status wise) is it common for parents to help out with college/university? Like,  did she assume certain things because that's how it is for her peers? I could kind of get her additude if that was the case, but she'll still have to learn at some point that life doesn't work out the same for everyone...", "NTA, all you can do is ve clear about your means and what you're able to help with, you shouldn't need to apologize for it.", "Once you graduate high school real life sets in.

Dumping this on her *now* is too late.", "I worked while studying full time for my fun money while my parents covered the most basic expenses. If it's just money for going out or a new phone a shift or two on the weekend or some extra tutoring is probably all she'll need to do to have a decent standard of living", "Pq parece ser brasileiro? Eu sou br e n\u00e3o peguei essa vibe nao. Parecia pra mim que fosse algo europeu, n\u00e3o sei", "The way OP writes, I believe she\u2019s from Brazil.\nIn Brazil, full-time colleges really mean all day. Mine was part-time (at night) and I had 6-8 classes a semester, 6h of classes every week night, plus some on weekends.\nI worked all day and went to school at night.\n\nFull time colleges there is usually something like 8-10h a day.", "Girl, I\u2019ve worked FULL TIME while going to college then university full time. My full time college was 6 classes and my university was 4 classes per semester. It\u2019s all doable!

Still had Saturday off and a few nights to study and do homework and party on Friday.) \n\nParents are a little TA imo, for not trying to find alternatives with her daughter. What about roommates? What about meal planning? You can always cut expenses elsewhere when you want, trust me.", "I worked full time (salaried and on-call 24/7) and went to college full-time. Granted, there was no time for anything extra. But yeah, she can still work part-time and still have time for doing fun stuff", "I don't know about your country, but in my country being a fulltime student is indeed a 40 hour- a week- fulltime job.", "Sure, but if you reduce tuition costs you free up money for living expenses . . .", "Coming from an American perspective this is just kind of humorous because if you dont get help, you basically starve to go to college and spend all your free time working anyway lol. \n\nI would say NTA because she can still go  she just has to level her expectations and take a hand in her own future which I wouldnt say is a bad thing. \n\nAlso, she could work part time or get a scholarship or something.", "I feel like you have set expectations for your daughter by continually stating \u201cyou would always provide the basics in college\u201d you have said that you will support her in her college career without caveats. \n\nGiven your assurances I feel like her emotions and objections are wholly justified. She worked hard made it into her dream school and now you\u2019re reneging. Of course she is going to feel betrayed. \n\nI would encourage you to give her a $amount you can contribute and let her make her own choices. \n\nBe aware that a part time course means double the time in college so double your contribution to her living expenses and double the time she is without a good income in her chosen profession. \n\nHaving a full time course means you will likely pay significantly less overall, as the duration of your support is halved and she will be earning an income in 3/4 years not 6/8. \n\nBeing kinda poor in college is a wonderful lesson in resilience and budgeting, and full time students are likely to make better connections with their cohort for their future careers. Not to mention the clout that comes from graduating from a top institution. I feel like you\u2019re doing your family a massive disservice by not encouraging her to take the better school.", "When I was in college, my course load was considered \u201cheavy\u201d (more than a normal full time student load but I was handling it well and getting the grades so they let me have at it resulting in graduating a semester early).  AND I had a part time work study job in the business office which involved working with external auditors and generating payroll so it was not a lightweight \u201cwork when you feel like it\u201d position.  AND we were required to do volunteer work in the community.\n\nBefore anyone freaks out about a lack of social life, I had a very active social life as well.\n\nIt\u2019s very doable but does require effort.  BTW, I chose a private school over a state one, so there was a significant difference in tuition/room & board/etc.  My parents could afford half of my tuition each year and I had to raise the rest.  \n\nIf your daughter wants this school badly enough, she needs to earn it.", "although ur daughter is reasonably upset that her dream college is being put into a risky play, youre nta. i think perhaps u can help her look into scholarships and other financial aid assistance from the school", "NTA. Also I went to school full time and worked part time and at times more then 1 part time job. Especially in summer I would try and work as much as possible to save to pay for school", "NAH, but it sounds like there was clearly a communication breakdown when you said you would be able to pay for college in previous years.

Life is about making choices, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s so shocked they aren\u2019t all going to be easy and fun. If she wants to go to a more expensive school, she will have less money for other things. That\u2019s perfectly reasonable.

It's hell but it's what I have to do right now", "You're assuming OP is in the US. It's not an option everywhere", "At the college I went to, full time was 15 to 18 credits, which translated to 24 to 30 hours in class per week.

It was basically the equivalent of having 2 full-time jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was SHOCKED to learn that at many universities, 12 credits means 12 hours in the classroom, and that\u2019s considered full time!", "NTA.\nSometimes your parents can't afford to pay a lot of money towards your education so you can take a education loan. Idk about where OP is from but in India if you are going to a tier 1 college with good placements, you can definitely and very easily get education loans.\nAlso Julia can definitely work part time. No joke, it is doable. Never did myself but had friends who tutored part time after attending university from 8:30am  to 5 pm 5 days a week on perquisites and if needed more time in labs. It is hard but possible", "Obviously NTA.  I don't know what country we're talking about,  but I went to school in the US,  went full time and worked my way through college.

OP should research to see if that\u2019s an option where they\u2019re from. A lot of these replies are US based, working 3-4 jobs and doing night classes is not a thing where i\u2019m from at all. We have a lot of academic or income based scholarships, my dorm was 130\u20ac a month and student restaurants were 3\u20ac a full meal.

There are plenty of families who can\u2019t afford to help their children out with college at all, and some who refuse to. You\u2019re doing her a great favor by providing these options, and you didn\u2019t say no to the one she wanted to go to, just that she may have to live a little less comfortably than she does now.
