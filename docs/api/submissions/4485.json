Because she is full-time, she wouldn't be able to have a part-time job and we would be \"tight\" financially by helping her pay there, so she wouldn't have fun money and she wouldn't have money for other things. The other college is part-time, she can work and it would be cheaper for us, so she wouldn't be so financially tight. \n\nShe asked  about the college fund and we were just like \"?\", because in my country it's not such a common practice, because the best colleges are public and honestly I really don't know where she got that idea, because we never brought it up that. \n\nShe looked shocked by this and started saying that basically we were telling her to choose between going to her dream college but she can never do anything because she doesn't have money left or go to her second option and have more financial freedom. \n\nAnd we agreed, we said it's our reality and although we want to help her with college, we can't spend everything on her while we have 2 more kids and a house to maintain. \n\nShe started to complain saying that due to our lack of financial planning (it is not, because if it weren't for our financial planning, she would never be able to go to that college), that we destroyed her expectations for college and enjoy a little,  that she was being harmed (edited)\n\n I felt offended, although we have financial conditions, this is the reality we can offer if she wants it and she sounded ungrateful. \n\nShe's acting cold with us and I'm lost. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670778156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zizpp5/aita_for_breaking_my_daughters_expectation_of_her/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is very generous for you to pay her basic living costs. Not all families are able to do that. Is there another option where she could defer for a year and work to save up for college \u2018fun money\u2019 while living with you?", "There's always option 3, she could take a year off and work, save money for her \"dream college\". \n\nOr option 4, earn a scholarship. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're giving her reasonable expectations, and while she isn't happy with it, you can't extend yourself beyond what you can give.", "NTA. The reality of the world she is going to have to learn to survive in is that hard choices exist, you can\u2019t have everything that you want, and sometimes you have to build your expectations off of your own economic reality, and not off things other families are able to do. I went to school with adults whose families paid everything for four year, while being someone who worked multiple jobs both on and off campus. It doesn\u2019t feel great to face other people\u2019s privilege, but that\u2019s life. \n\nShe gets to be disappointed, because this is disappointing. She doesn\u2019t get to be hostile and she doesn\u2019t get to blame you for capitalism.", "NTA, time for your little girl to grow up and realize that sometimes perusing your dream means you need to make sacrifices. You're doing what you can and still have two other children to raise. She has options and if she \"wants it all*, she needs to figure out how to make it work. Welcome to adulthood.", "NTA. It's always tough to hear that you can't have your cake and eat it too, but that doesn't mean that you don't need to be told the truth. And that's what you did here, you told your daughter the truth.", "NTA. She\u2019s acting her age which is understandable. You\u2019ve told her the reality of her situation and it\u2019s up to her to pick the option she prefers. \n\nIt will probably take her a bit if Ime to come to term with the reality of her situation so give her some space.", "NTA\n\nCollege funds aren't a thing where I live either, people either Save up themselves to pay for it (but that's really really uncommon), Work part-time (this is what usually happens), Get grants ect to help with cost of living....or they take out student loans/living costs ect.\n\nYou never said she COULDN'T go to her dream university you were just being realistic with her about the financial situation in regards to her living situation while at school.\n\nIs she able to save up some money before school starts and maybe see if there is any grants she can apply for to help with living costs?", "NTA in my opinion. Its not like you lied and misrepresented what you had stored away, in that case I'd say you'd be the asshole. Is there a reason you guys didn't have this conversation sooner though?", "NTA, you're realistic. Reading your story, I thought that you're Brazilian and I saw a lot of friends in the se situation.\nStudy full time is complicated and require a lot of money. If you're really Brazilian, your daughter can look for \"scholarships\" that helps full time students to maintain during college, but it's very complicated", "NTA.\n\nShe made an assumption and it backfired. That's not your fault.", "NTA if she wants to go to her dream college so bad then she can take out loans, or secure a job to help pay for school.", "She is feeling entitled to what she invisions as the perfect life for herself, which is common for middle-class 18-year-olds. She doesn't understand yet how much hard work it takes to maintain that lifestyle. Have a serious discussion about budget, expenses and income and decide together what the plan is. Either is doable (and honestly I'd pick the one in the capital, that has more \"opportunities\") if she understands what needs to be sacrificed for the more important stuff.", "NTA. You can only do what you can do. If she wants to go to a particular school so badly, she can take a year off and work to afford it herself.", "NTA.  This is something you've talked with her about before.  You're also not saying she can't go, but that if she does, money will be tight, right?\n\nI'm wondering if there would be other ways for her to bring costs down.  For example, students in the US sometimes work as an RA (sort of like a supervisor/prefect) in a university dormitory so they can get free or cheaper living accommodations.  She may well also be able to work limited hours outside of school as well, such as tutoring high school students who live by the campus.  \n\nShe needs to start researching these options immediately -- and she is the one who needs to put the work into it, not you.  If she really wants to go, she needs to show it by being serious about finding ways to make it affordable.", "NTA, but I hope you\u2019ve learned from this to have this discussion *long* before when you had it with Julia. It sounds like she wasn\u2019t clear on the situation - knowing sooner might have made it a little smoother now. She still might have been upset, but to apply and be accepted, she\u2019s now left knowing that she had to leave that chance on the table. \n\nMy kid is not quite 11, and she and I have already talked about this. She knows what I can pay for (not in dollars because inflation, but instead that we will look at what the top end public schools in my state would cost including room and board - if she wants to go somewhere more expensive than that, it\u2019s on her to earn scholarships or take out loans for the difference), and she can plan and dream accordingly. \n\nIt\u2019s 100% fine to set realistic expectations, but I would set them early as opposed to at the moment of a decision.", "NTA. You have told her how you are able to help. She can accept it or find a different way. My folks paid books, tuition and a fixed amount for living expenses. I had to figure out the budget.", "No, you are NTA and does she know parents are not required to pay for any college education? It is a privilege if you can do that for her. She is acting spoiled and entitled. You gave her her choices. She can choose from that. If she does not like it, well lots of people have it way worse. She needs to suck it up.  But you are NTA.", "NAH, I\u2019d say, but at least NTA. You\u2019re just giving her reasonable expectations, but she also has the right to feel a little upset when her expectations aren\u2019t met. Just give her a little time and talk to her, she\u2019ll come to see you are doing the best you can.", "NAH. If you guys are in Brazil (which it sounds like from the description) there are some options for scholarships... That said most scientific institutions are desperately underfunded and these scholarships have been frozen for a while. If the capital here is UnB there are certain arrangements to make the situation cheaper. There is the pensionato in asa sul which is a cheaper housing option for the ladies, it might help having a bit more cash on hand. If the situation is truly dire the university has accomodation possibilities as well. It's not an AH move to manage her expectations, but you all should do some research regarding her options before flat out refusing her too.", "definitely NTA, your daughter\u2019s expectations are pretty unreasonable. the vast majority of parents cannot afford to cover their children\u2019s post-secondary schooling expenses and she should be grateful you\u2019re able to help! at the end of the day, as long as she applies herself and makes good connections, it\u2019s not going to matter what school she goes to.", "NTA. She can go to her dream school. I have no clue what \"fun\" she thinks she needs to do while in school. I assume there are activities & organizations she can do that are funded by the school. If she thinks it's on you to provide money for clubbing or trips, she's being a spoiled brat. Even at a full time U, she should be able to get a part time job on the weekends, or work during summer break.", "I have mixed feelings about this.\nOn the one side, yeah, you are her parents and you should have prepared any amount you can spare to your kids and their future.\nOn the other hand I imagine your kids never lacked any sort of food, shelter or other important things they would need (not counting phones, toys and other luxuries).\n\nI am tending to say NTA as you provided as much as you can for now and got rational together with your daughter to talk about the situation and the circumstances instead of saying it is to expensive and declining her dream college.\n\nShe has the right to choose now.\nEither her dream college and missing out on \"fun stuff and luxuries\" or another college but having access/time/money to the \"fun stuff\".\n\nNTA \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\nYou did your best and still trying, good parents and a slightly entitled spoiled kid.", "This is about responsibility, not money. Your daughter was planning on her dream, and expected you to be fully responsible for making it happen.  That\u2019s unrealistic, and she must learn that. \n\nIf she wants her dream, she can take responsibility and make it happen. She could look for scholarships.  She could take a year or two to work full-time, and save for her own college fund. Or, she can choose the part-time school. \n\nShe has options, and she is in control of making her own choices. She is incredibly lucky to be in this position. \n\nGrowing up is hard. Take this opportunity to teach her a positive lesson about responsibility and taking control of her own future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughter had a dream of a certain college, and you advised her that college is not a \"gimme\" for her.\n\nMy parents, in the US, also let me know that they would help, but would not completely fund my education.  I worked my tiny, hiney off to early scholarships to ensure I could attend a decent college.  I attended college and did okay, and still obtained a college loan.  A college loan in the 1980's is nothing like a loan now.\n\nIt seems like you've tried to inform her, probably very gently, and she didn't want to hear it.  But it is hard for her to absorb that she cannot have what she wants right now.", "NTA. She\u2019s immature and doesn't like having constraints. No one likes them, but she is just now learning to deal with life's limitations. You\u2019re not responsible to soothe her distaste for certain realities. You need to let her cry this out alone until she's ready to look at how she wants to handle it. This is part of development and building maturity. \n\nStep back, let her process the information, and then she can come to you with her plan when she's ready.

I did it all 4 years.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s having to learn now she can\u2019t have everything she wants but that\u2019s reality.", "NTA, virtually everyone is living under financial restrictions. You've been honest from the get go.

This is not the reality for most of us, and while it is an uncomfortable discovery for Julia, it is a good thing for her to come to terms with and recognize so that she can make a realistic plan and move forward.", "NTA.  She has a choice and it\u2019s on her.  Go to dream college and not have fun money.  Go to 2nd college, part time job and have money.  Maybe save money and transfer later to dream college.", "NTA\nParenting is hard and 18yo are not fully grown ups yet. She seems to have led pretty privileged life this far and that's also could be the reason she is so angry right now.", "For one, why CAN'T she work part time while studying?\n\nI know that different countries do things differently - but I've studied in Scotland, England, the USA, and I've done a post-grad.\n\nAll of them were considered to be full time.\n\nAnd there was definitely time for a part time job, in fact the vast majority of students I knew had part time jobs.\n\nHell, a girl I knew was studying full time, plus she also had a full time job, plus another 2x part time jobs on the side.\n\nI can understand that you would rather that she didn't work and just focused on her studies. But realistically, you can't stop her.\n\nI'd somewhat recommend cutting back her hours in the more senior years - 3rd and 4th year presuming a 4 year degree - but I know folk who got top grades and they worked practically full time on top of \"full time\" study.\n\nMy full time study experience boiled down to the equivalent of working part time with relatively few hours, and it can vary from week to week.\n\nBetween 12 and 18 hours of class contact time (lectures and lab sessions) plus around another 12 hours a week of self study and homework with some weeks being more, but most weeks being less. \n\nUnless full time study in your country is something different, she has time for a part time job to earn her beer tokens. \n\nBut beyond that, you're doing OK. You're offering her a good bit more than what other families will offer, even if they're able to offer more than you. \n\nYou're offering to pay living expenses - rent, bills, food. \n\nYou're not saying that if she goes part time that you'll suddenly be giving her extra money - she's having to earn it. \n\nI'd possibly include a phone bill on top of that because they're pretty much essential these days.\n\nBut other than that, everything else should be up to her. \n\nMaybe agree on money for one extracurricular - because they're pretty good. A sport or a club or something is good for socialising and exploring hobbies.\n\nWhat about tuition? You haven't mentioned tuition at all. Is it free because it's a public university?", "She sounds very entitled. If she really wants it that badly, she could take a little time off, get a job and save some money. She could get a part-time job in school, or she could search for scholarships and grants.", "Massive YTA. All of you should have had a conversation about family finances and what you could afford before she applied to college, instead of her putting in the hard work only to be disappointed in the end.", "YTA. All of you sh", "Option 3 would only be an option if colleges in their country allows you to defer admission. Not every college allows that.", "There's always work-study jobs. Full time school isn't like a full-time job. 12 credits is full time, usually 3-4 classes.\n\nI've worked part time retail while going to school full time. It IS doable.", "ThT bei g said, where was thiz conveesatikn a year ago and during the application prossess", "This. \n\n& I would add that OP should be having these conversations with the younger children now. Don't let them coast by for so long with no idea about how finances work. That's leaving them unprepared for the real world. & I would suggest making it a conversation using tangible examples. \n\nFor instance, as a kid when my shoe size got into \"adult\" sizes, my parents sat me down & plainly said that they can't afford the expensive basketball shoes that I wanted (Jordans) considering how frequent my shoe size was changing. Completely reasonable, but as a 10 year old I wasn't the most understanding. They could get me some shoes (maybe even 2 pairs) from a store like Payless, but if I wanted Jordans I would need to pay for them, meaning I would need to get a job. So 10 year old me thought about it, & then went & got a shitty job for a few hours after school a couple days a week & 1 weekend day. Soon enough I was walking around like a little Jordan/Nike ad with all the shit I bought, as that was all 10/11 year old me spent $ on. Thankfully, I grew out of that & learned how to save $ for proper expenses. & overall I think working as a child was tremendously beneficial for me in many ways, chief among them because it shattered that sense of entitlement early on.\n\nSo I'll lean towards NTA, but if you're expecting your kids to be able to \"act like an adult\" at 18 years old, part of that is teaching them about things like handling finances/managing a budget well before they're 18.", "I'm not sure if I'm getting the wrong end of the stick reading OP's post, or your comment.\n\nFrom my understanding OP is offering to pay basic living expenses - food, bills, and rent ONLY.\n\nTuition isn't mentioned, which I presume to mean that as a public university in OP's country, means that its \"free\". \n\nAnything beyond that, her daughter is expected to pay herself - new phones, nights out, extracurriculars, etc.\n\nWhat they're saying is that if she studies full time, then she won't be able to work and earn her fun money.\n\nBut if she wants to work for her fun money, it's at the lower university.\n\nAnd her daughter is then asking - \"well, where's that savings account for me to have fun at uni?\"\n\nTo which OP is like \"??? what do you mean, were paying all your necessary expenses and the rest is up to you...\"\n\nSo her daughter is now complaining she won't get given fun money. \n\nSo, am I missing something in my interpretation?", "Work study was like a grand or less a semester at my school and most jobs didn\u2019t pay any better than working outside the school. It\u2019s beer money basically", "Can't speak for OP but as I understand the daughter wanted the full university experience, studying and having fun with parties, maybe a car or whatever the girl had in mind.", "I got much more, part was Federal, and the rest was paid by the department hiring me. I got about $10k per semester.", "I did work study at university, which paid for half of my tuition (in the US, uni isn\u2019t free).  That was a big deal. I also took a full course load, and still worked a part time job, because I needed to put gas in my car, but things, and eat.  Even working for a grand a semester would at least give her SOME money. She wants to be fully funded to go to her dream school."]}
