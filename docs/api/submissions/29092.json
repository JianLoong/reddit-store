But she never apologized to the people she bullied or anything.\n\nMy relationship with mom is not great anyway. I was basically raised by my aunt those first 9 years and even though I slept under my mom's roof. I was at my aunt's house every day. She fed me. She cared for me when I was sick.

The fact she cut me off from my aunt and cousin and refused to allow any contact for so long makes me really angry.", "Yep.

Not liking or befriending someone doesn't mean you're behaving badly.", "OP has the right to choose  her or his friends. \n\nRegardless of age, not wanting to give Hannah a second chance does not make OP an AH.\n\nHannah is reaping the rewards of her behavior. \n\nHannah, her Dad and OP's mom are the AHs here.", "Has she ever apologised, sincerely for her behaviour?", "OP never says whether Hannah has offered an apology for her past behavior. That matters. If she has, then maybe trying to see her as she is now could have some merit.

If someone, I don\u2019t care how old they were, bullied the sibling of my heart, it would takes a lot of work on the part of the bully to build any type of relationship.  Is possible that you can forgive but certainly not forget.  Plus you mom criticizing you behavior is out of line.  Maybe if she had actually been a mom and raised you, and saw how you felt about the fianc\u00e9 and his daughter before they married.

Evil is conscious harm to another, except in self-defense. Most people fall into the middle category, including many who thing of themselves as basically good people.\n2. The parameters of OP's current course of action is unclear from her post. **If OP is co-existing with Hannah without obvious meanness or disdain within the family unit, that is neutral behavior**, but it's hard to tell when she described herself as barely tolerating her and when her and her mom are having constant fights about it. OP says that people will start to be Hannah's friend but drop her once they find out about her past bullying. **If OP is the one telling Hannah's new friends how awful she used to be or encouraging others  to do it so Hannah can't keep any new friends, OP is a bad person for that.**\n3. **OP is also harming herself by not getting counseling to work through and resolve her feelings about Hannah in particular and her blended family generally.** She is carrying around this hate with her every day in her living space, which is supposed to be a haven, and it's likely to affect her future relationships. She should work through that in a healthy way. **Counseling may also result in the counselor telling her mom to back off about this, which would reduce OP's stress.**\n4. **If OP forgives Hannah, she is a good person.** But as others have said, deep-seated trauma makes forgiveness difficult. I think people should just drop the \"forget\" part of \"forgive and forget\". The only constructive meaning that word has in this context is in the sense that one should stop bringing up the past wrongs of the other party. OP is bad if she's doing this, but I don't get the sense that she's starting each day announcing \"Hannah delendo est\" at the breakfast table.\n5. I don't think embracing/befriending/besistering? Hannah would make OP a good person if she's not inclined to do it. But I think **OP would be a good person if she could come to an entente cordial within the household, reducing everyone's stress and awkwardness.** As noted above, I think OP would be a good person - and be acting in her own best interests - if she would gently steer Hannah in directions where she might develop other friends, so mom would stop pestering her.\n6.
