Bullies can change just as much as anyone else.", "Comments like this getting downvoted are so confusing. I guess most people are really young. Someone was a jerk as a preteen and then seems to have genuinely changed and is a better person now. Better hold that grudge forever. The OP is still a kid she will either get over it soon enough or be the jerk. I can\u2019t imagine hearing a 30 year old saying well I don\u2019t see my step sister because she was a bully when she was 12 but then changed a bunch and is great now. Life is too short for this kind of crap.", "I think the initial change is because she had nobody and the most convenient person (me) didn't have any interest in her. Do I think she might have realized bullying is wrong? I think it's possible by now. It has been 3 years since she started being nicer to others. But she never apologized to the people she bullied or anything.\n\nMy relationship with mom is not great anyway. I was basically raised by my aunt those first 9 years and even though I slept under my mom's roof. I was at my aunt's house every day. She fed me. She cared for me when I was sick. Picked me up from school. Was the one they called if I needed to go home early. She was the one who spent time with me. Sometimes mom would join us. But it's not like she and I did our own thing together.", "It makes me mad that mom essentially allowed me to have a start where I had a daily parental figure (aunt) and a sibling (cousin) and knew that I relied on them but then once mom was a little older and married, she thought I would choose my siblings bully (Hannah) over the person I loved as a sibling (cousin). The fact she cut me off from my aunt and cousin and refused to allow any contact for so long makes me really angry.", "Yep. She only ever had one friend and people she was shitty to did not want to be her friend after she had some wake up call type thing. She was shitty to so many kids. And her friend even worse and she always defended her friend.\n\nShe had no control over what my parent did. Or her parent. But just because my mom married her dad, to me, it did not mean I would start to like her or even care to welcome her into my life.

OP doesn't want a relationship with Hannah, so they don't have to put work towards that. Bully reaped what she sowed.", "I don't see where OP is being openly nasty to Hannah, so I'm not sure why you're calling her an AH. Not liking or befriending someone doesn't mean you're behaving badly.", "OP has the right to choose  her or his friends. \n\nRegardless of age, not wanting to give Hannah a second chance does not make OP an AH.\n\nHannah is reaping the rewards of her behavior. \n\nHannah, her Dad and OP's mom are the AHs here.", "Has she ever apologised, sincerely for her behaviour?", "OP never says whether Hannah has offered an apology for her past behavior. That matters. If she has, then maybe trying to see her as she is now could have some merit. But if she knows she\u2019s hurt people and has never apologized or attempted to make amends, then that\u2019s not the past, that\u2019s ongoing.", "Yeah you are so not the AH.  If someone, I don\u2019t care how old they were, bullied the sibling of my heart, it would takes a lot of work on the part of the bully to build any type of relationship.  Is possible that you can forgive but certainly not forget.  Plus you mom criticizing you behavior is out of line.  Maybe if she had actually been a mom and raised you, and saw how you felt about the fianc\u00e9 and his daughter before they married. She could have gotten you individual therapy and family therapy before the marriage.  Then it would have been a smoother blending of families or it could have shown that it\u2019s just not going to work.", "How long ago did she stop bullying people? The incidents with your cousin in the story are from when she was 10 or younger it looks like\n\nIt sounds like you've been put in an awkward situation, one that the adults should have resolved or helped with years ago, no one should expect you to gel as family by proximity\n\nI will say though, a lot of the negative feelings are pointed at Hannah when the story was meant to be about your mother, she may have been a bully as a kid but she's not the family scapegoat", "If she cured cancer would you forgive her for being a childhood bully? If she apologized to you and your cousin and went to his pride parades? If she donated a kidney to your beloved aunt? Or are you going to hate her forever for behavior she likely learned from someone abusive or neglectful and has grown out of? Will you be happy if she commits suicide out of loneliness and despair?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be Hannah\u2019s friend. But damn, you are an asshole for holding this girl eternally responsible for childhood wrongs. You\u2019re 17. It\u2019s time to grow up. And it\u2019s time for you to think about what kind of person you want to be as an adult.\n\nHere\u2019s how to handle this like a good person. Tell Hannah that even though you know she\u2019s grown and changed, you and a lot of the other kids your age are still having difficulty letting go of her childhood bullying and cruelty. Tell her that you think the person she is now deserves to have friends. Suggest that a fresh start somewhere like in a college a couple of hours away or a job where no one knows her might help her meet new people who won\u2019t hold her past against her. Maybe also have this conversation separately with your mom and stepdad so they can encourage her.", "my bad I didn't explain properly, obviously NTA overall just that OP should be careful not to point her hatred in the wrong direction\n\nEvery adult here (except maybe the aunt) has acted badly, and Hannah is the one suffering the negative effects", "This is a good question. Simply changing is not enough. She hurt OP and her cousin/best friend and she needs to apologize for that to be deserving of their friendship.", "It took a little while after her friend left and she realized I wasn't going to be her friend. So she was definitely 14 but closer to 15.", "I don't think I will hate her forever. But just because I don't hate her at some point doesn't mean I would want her in my life or would play sisters with her. My cousin is the only real sibling I have. The two of us have bonded since we were babies and we have each other's backs. Hannah was the asshole who hurt him and others I love. Hannah is someone I would have chosen to yeet from my life in a second if I had the choice.\n\nShe could grow up into an amazing person and for everyone's sake I hope she does. But she will never be my person.", "It seems Hannah has done nothing to redeem herself until her partner in crime abandoned her, and she found herself friendless.\n\nAnd even then, what did she do?\n\nStop bullying others????\n\nAct like a human being?\n\nBig deal. \n\nI think the only reason Hannah is not bullying anymore is that bullies are cowards who run in n packs. \n\nHannah has lost her bully support system. \n\nHannah hasn't changed. \n\nShe just hasn't found a new bully buddy. \n\nOP has every right to choose who is in her life. \n\nThe only AH here is Hannah.", "Agreed", "So basically, it's been three years since she shaped up and had her, as you call it, wake up call.  \n\nSorry, but NTA.  Bullying can scar people for an entire lifetime.  I know several functioning adults with successful careers and family lives who still have visceral reactions to things that happened to them in high school.", "You\u2019re jumping to a lot of unfounded, negative, and unkind conclusions here. Clearly, you\u2019re Hobbesian while I am Lockean.\n\nBut the real difference between your approach and mine on the moral issue is that your moral determination hinges on mere lack of obligation while mine hinges on virtue. Your inquiry is whether OP HAS to do something. My inquiry is whether OP\u2019s course of action makes her a good person.\n\nOn the good/neutral/evil axis of the alignment table, I am a good person and you are a neutral one.", "I disagree. \n\nI think you assume too much.\n\nWhat about OP's course of action makes her a good person, a bad person, or a neutral person?\n\nIf she forgives, forgets, and embraces Hannah, in your world, she is a good person?\n\nIf not,  she is a bad person, or. at least, a neutral person?\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy as long as OP does nothing obviously mean or hateful towards Hannah, can OP keep Hannah at a distance?\n\nWhy?"]}
