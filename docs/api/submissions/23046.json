{"id": 23046, "submission_id": "158l2o6", "title": "AITA for not wanting people at the hospital during or after giving birth?", "selftext": "I(27F) and my husband (25M) are expecting our first child, a son, this fall. From the beginning of this pregnancy I knew I did not want people other than my husband in the room while I gave birth along with not wanting visitors at the hospital after the fact. The hospital we are giving birth at doesn't even keep you more than 48hours so long as everything goes well during labor. Plus, I will be navigating breastfeeding along with my self care portion of it all as I plan to give birth naturally. My husband is very much on board of whatever I need to make this experience the best possible for me and accepts the fact that if I'm not comfortable with people at the hospital then they won't be there.\nHowever, even though I have closed off visitation from the hospital we have told all family and close friends, that once we get home and are settled in we are more than happy to have everyone come visit us at home. To me, this will be a better environment as I'II be more comfortable, in more space, and our family will have more time to visit with us. My mother has been very demanding that she be allowed to be at the hospital as it's her first grand baby and it's her \"right\" to be there. (Note: I have two younger siblings who are minors that live with her and my step father whom would not be allowed to come visit in the hospital as it's against hospital regulations unless they are a sibling of the new They also live out of town so if she came, it wou more than likely mean my siblings would not be able to come visit until weeks later as finances for travel are tight in their home) I have stated my concerns and choice to my mother on several occasions and it's a constant fight with her. At one point she dropped from doing my baby shower. Now my cousin and friends are generously throwing me one.\nThings lately have been a bit better with my mom and I was actually enjoying talking and sharing life with her. I felt like had my mom back since we have recently been fighting due to my hospital boundaries I set. Today, I mentioned to her that we are doing our hospital tour this evening and that I was excited. She took this moment to yet again try to manipulate/bully me into changing my mind. I told her she was upsetting me and that I have already decided what I wanted and to drop it. I ended up texting her that I can't keep having the same conversation because I will NOT be changing my mind. I told her I want her there after, at the house, and that I want to continue to share my experiences on this journey but that I needed to be respected on my choice to not have people at the hospital. In response, she states she will not be told when and how to be apart of my life and that it's all or nothing. She told me she wishes me the best of luck but she cannot continuously pour her heart out for it to be stomped on. Thus, saying she won't be my life which means I won't have access to my siblings. So, am I wrong?", "created_utc": 1690228403, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158l2o6/aita_for_not_wanting_people_at_the_hospital/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your birth.  Your rules.\n\nAdvise the hospital staff of your wishes to get them on board with keeping out any unwanted visitors.  \n\nAnd no one has a \u201cright\u201d to be in the delivery room with you.", "NTA\n\nStand by your boundaries.\n\nShe cancelled your baby shower over this?  Your mom is blowing smoke to try to bully you into doing what SHE wants.  She sounds like a manipulative bully.  Please keep in mind there's a good chance you may have to go limited contact with Mom at some point.  She has two young children to take care of - your child is not her responsibility.\n\nIf you plan to announce things via social media, make sure hubs and you do it.  Otherwise, I can see Mom taking it on herself to share information that isn't hers to share.\n\nYour cousin sounds like a sweetie.\n\nGive yourself a week minimum to settle in after you get home before you have visitors. (Voice of experience)\n\nHappy Baby and Happy Shower\n\nHugs", "NTA. She said she will not be told when and how to be apart of my life and that it's all or nothing. Um, that's not what you're doing? That's super manipulative and by her logic, you can't create any boundaries at all that aren't in line with what she wants.\n\nYou are asking for TWO days for no visitors in the hospital. Not sure why she is making such a fuss about this.", "NTA - stick to your guns.  Having a baby is exhausting and painful and messy and scary.  Before, during, AND after.  And figuring out how to breastfeed can be a new form of torture if you and/or the baby have any difficulties.  You'll be at your most vulnerable and just want to bond with your husband and baby.  This is 100% okay to do, and your mom is so far out of line that it's breathtaking.\n\nBe sure to tell the hospital that you do not want any visitors, regardless of who they are.  Maybe even tell them that you don't want your mom (by name) to have access to you or the baby while you're there.  The hospital will prevent her from trying to sneak in against your wishes.", "NTA. You have a right to choose who will be there, and when you start accepting visitors.\n\nIf you give in to her now, she will learn that this type of emotional blackmail works and keep using it to get her way", "NTA. No one has the \"right\" to be with a mother when she's giving birth. It's her decision. I've seen other queries on here where the mother only wanted her own mother and not the husband, so is she the AH for keeping him out...or wanting her sister instead of the husband or mother, so is she the AH...etc. No. It's whoever she wants to be there with her. Or if she wants no one at all.\n\nBut your mother's reaction is very weird. I've never heard of someone saying if they can't be there at the birth they will go NC with the mother. I would not deal with this now, but focus on the pregnancy, the birth, and the period after...then reach out to her again. Maybe talk to a counselor to help you sort it out emotionally.", "NTA. You can manage your labor and delivery in whatever way is safest and most appropriate for you and baby. \n\nIMO your mother will never cut off contact with you because that would end all the drama and she is clearly in it for the drama.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t tell anyone when you go into labor and start taking longer to return calls or texts so when you don\u2019t reply while in labor they don\u2019t assume.", "Congratulations on your bundle of joy!\n\n***\"It's all or nothing\"***\n\nLooks like Mom has made her own decision, so for the time being, go NC with her.  At this point in your life, you don't need the stress she causes.  Definitely don't tell her when you go into labor, so she doesn't show up at the hospital.  Later on, you can reach out if you so desire.  When she complains, just remind her of her words:  \"It's all or nothing\".", "NTA.  There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cit\u2019s my first grandkid so I have rights to see them in the hospital.\u201d", "First of all, please know that you are NTA. At all. The birth can be painful, it can be chaotic if things don\u2019t go as planned, breastfeeding takes a minute, etc. Definitely protect your peace. \n\nI gave birth during Covid so only 2 people were allowed to be at the hospital at all, and the nursery was closed. It\u2019s just a different world now. Only having the parents of the baby at the hospital is so normal. I bet if you asked the hospital, they\u2019d even have a quick one-liner you could feed your mom about how they suggest only parents, or they \u201crequire\u201d visitors to wait outside anyways, etc. I hate lying but in this case\u2026 you could just put it on the hospital. \n\nThat being said - I\u2019m so sorry your mom ended up saying she\u2019s \u201call or nothing.\u201d Being \u201call or nothing\u201d is what my ex-MIL used to say to always get her way and ignore any boundaries. It\u2019s no way to have someone in your life. Don\u2019t feel bad for wanting a normal, healthy relationship with boundaries with your mom. Stay strong \ud83d\udcaa.", "NTA. Don\u2019t tell anyone when you give birth. Take a few days to soak up the love with your husband and contact family once your settled in at home with your baby.", "Absolutely positively NTA. This is your baby, your child birth, and 100% your decision. I don\u2019t blame mom for being disappointed or whatever, but that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean she gets to try and change your mind. A few days after your and baby are home isn\u2019t that far away. As a mother, she herself should understand!! \n\nAnd her being petty and canceling your baby show is completely childish and spiteful in my opinion. Now she\u2019s continuing to manipulate and gaslight you I to what she wants by \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d -\u201call or nothing\u201d attitude. It\u2019s completely selfish but as long as she gets what she\u2019s wants it doesn\u2019t matter what you want you even your siblings.", "Nope, NTA at all.  YOU are the one going through major surgery. YOU get to call ALL THE SHOTS.\n\nI don't have kids. When my niece was born, my parents came up for the night before the birth (planned induction). My mum and dad both stayed at my sister and BIL's house to take care of fuzzy brother (the dog) until sis and baby came home. After that, Dad went home for a few days and I came over to do the early days stuff. Mum and I went shopping to get out of the house to give the new parents just an hour to be together (we bought the \"Frozen\" DVD b/c it was out that week and it would've been the first Disney Movie baby would have).  That night, we washed and folded all of the clothes and just let the parents sleep while singing \"Let it Go\" under our breaths.  About a month later, my BIL's Mum came to stay. She lives across the country, so sis was like, \"Can you come help 'Mom Clean'? I came over and helped.\"  BIL's Mum is a dear and helped take care of that little sweets.\n\nThe next year (15 months later), my nephew was born 3 weeks early. Mum and Dad were planning to come up when he was due, but ended up racing up while I went to the hospital to grab my niece.  I had to come to the hospital to take care of her while her parents were in the delivery room.  While sis was still in hospital, I worked half days from home and went to the hospital to run errands and get snacks.  Worst thing was, my boss had arranged someone to specifically come to work with me and tried to work around my impending nibling's schedule. No one ever counted on him coming early.  We'd paid all this money for this consultant to come out and he was on the plane when I texted my boss like, \"So...I'm at the hospital....\"    \n\n\neeps!!!  \n\n\nBasic rule: If you're asked to come to the hospital, be helpful. If you're at the house after, SERIOUSLY BE HELPFUL. \n\nIf you can't be helpful, stay away until you're either not expected to be (like after the first birthday) or you can pull your shit together and be.", "NTA. Your mom is a bit much. Your response should be, \u201cif that is how you want it, then she can have the consequences of her decision\u201d \n\nDo not give her any more information. Put her number on mute, and don\u2019t respond to her. She is trying for emotional blackmail. She can use a good time out for awhile. This will also teach that if she chooses to use emotional blackmail in the future she will lose.\n\nEnjoy your new baby", "NTA. I allowed a lot of people to be present at my first birth and didn't even allow my mom to be present at my second. Doing it with just my husband and I was 100 times better. I even waited a few hours to tell anyone that my second child had been born so that my husband and I had time to just enjoy our new baby without being inundated by people wanting to visit.", "NTA - you are the one going through an incredibly invasive and personal procedure to bring YOUR child into the world. You get to decide who is going to be there. Mom needs to take a step back and be glad you are letting visit you in the home afterwards. Some people do not allow others to do that.... so she should keep that stuff to herself.", "NTA\n\nShe's not the one having the baby, meaning she has nothing to do with the birthing plan. It's *your* baby so *you* do whatever will make this a stress-free situation.", "NTA. Your life, your rules. \nYour mum is making this about her and has no consideration for you and your wishes. And that is unfair. Giving birth is hard work, you need to recuperate. And it's fully understandable you want to have some time alone with your baby at first. It's not like you don't want her to meet her grandchild, just not right away. And that's totally fine.", "Your body, your rules.", "Soft YTA \n\nI get not wanting anyone in the room during your birth but after the birth... especially for your mom's first grandchild, I don't think it's unreasonable for your mom to want to be there.\n\nI come from a more traditional family though where this is more of an expectation. I was in the hospital the day my nephew and cousin were born. We had about 10 people from the immediate family show up for each. \n\nTo me, showing up to the hospital is just an act of love and they want to be there for you. Think you're being a little harsh not even letting your mom come to the hospital unless your relationship was toxic before your pregnancy", "NTA I was the same, I really didn't want anyone there except my husband. I did have an old friend visit unexpectedly my last day at the hospital but it was a really sweet surprise", "NTA, is there a way to not tell her your giving birth or even announce your babies birth until after your home? Once your home and comfortable then you can let everyone know you gave birth and are recovering at home ready for visitors if you would like.", "NTA. She tried to emotionally manipulate you with that last comment. Leave her out of things until the baby is born.", "NTA.  Your mom is being extremely manipulative and controlling and I can see why you are setting firm boundaries.  My mom was lowkey the same way.  When I got married out of state i'd get the calls that since she couldn't be there for the dress fitting then she'd just not show up to the wedding.  Anyway, you are right about the hospital spitting you out barely 48 hours after giving birth.  During that time you are navigating being a new mom, nursing (if you want to), the baby is being taken to get tested, etc... you will be tired, want to rest and the list goes on.  It isn't optimal visiting time and wanting people to visit your home when you're ready makes a lot of sense.  Stand your ground.  I can guarantee your mom won't want to cut the baby out of her life so she's going to have to eventually come around.  Best wishes to you!", "Don't even need to read the post.  Giving birth is a huge event, it's exciting, terrifying, wonderful and testing.     \nBirth really does, take you and your character to the limit.    \nAnd while the room may have medical staff flitting about, it's honestly really personal.  \n\nDo yourself a favour, stick to your guns, you don't  need the added presuure of her in the lobby pestering to come in, or her inside up in you ear.   It is up to hear if she wants to let her ego damage the relationship between the two of you or hers with her grandchild.   Not her birth, not her place to try and call the shots.  This one is all about you, your husband and the life you have made.\n\nGood luck for your birth, and your journey into parenthood.", "I ended up texting her that I can't keep having the same conversation because I will NOT be changing my mind. \n\nNTA.   Tell her to stop texting  or you will be blocking  her...and do it.\n\nAs a first time grandma,  I would never demand  to be allowed at the hospital.\n\nI'd be so pissed, I'd tell my to eff off if she kept it up", "NTA. \n\nHow is she continuously \u201cpouring her heart out\u201d while also cancelling your baby shower? \n\nAlso, nice of her to say you can\u2019t decide when and how she\u2019ll be a part of your life by turning around and telling you when and how you can have her in your life.", "NTA\n\nNo one has the right to be there aside from you, baby, and the medical staff.  (And the latter still limited)", "NTA. Does your mother always throw tantrums when she doesn't get her way?", "I am sorry that you are dealing with this at all, let alone from a parent. Your mom should be more supportive of your decisions on what you want than anyone else. NTA", "NTA. Your point, if I understand clearly, is you want to reduce the number of people in your hospital room to staff and your husband. This makes sense, as some people tend to talk over medical professionals in these circumstances, and you might want an absence of interference from non-professionals. Besides that, your home is a much more comfortable place to take in guests who will want to see you and your new child, right?  If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ve set a very reasonable boundary. Something some grandparents don\u2019t get is that grandparents don\u2019t have rights.", "NTA.  Pretty simple, you just don't call anyone you don't want around when you go into labor.  They can find out after the fact.", "NO. She\u2019s being very manipulative with her behavior. Stand your ground. Double down and follow through. Alert the staff she\u2019s not to be admitted. If your mother has a key to your house - change the locks. Garage keypad -change the code. She is setting the precedent to walk all over you to do as she pleases with your child.  Her \u201cright\u201d ends and begins where you say it does when she acts like that", "NTA\n\nAnd you are perfectly within polite society to not even tell her that the bundle of joy is here until you are all safe home from the hospital!", "First, ur Mom thought the threat of canceling the baby shower would change your mind. It didn\u2019t. Now she\u2019s going nuclear, threatening to remove herself from your life if you don\u2019t give in. DON\u2019T REWARD BAD BEHAVIOR. And don\u2019t react if she brings it up again. Just \u201cwe\u2019ve already discussed this. Please change the subject.\u201d And don\u2019t engage. Nobody can make you discuss anything you don\u2019t want to. Setting these boundaries and not giving in to her temper tantrums is good practice for what you will have to do when the baby comes. Because she will be offering nonstop unsolicited advice and will not be happy with how much time she gets with the baby and the rules. I just know this. All you need to do is state your wishes clearly and stick to your boundaries and resulting consequences for violating them cheerfully. Don\u2019t let her ruin this experience for you. \n\nAlso, I can sense you desperately want a good relationship with your Mom. We all do! But it sounds like your Mom is very emotionally immature. And maybe even mentally ill. Google some info on what it means to grow up with emotionally immature parents. Think you\u2019ll find it enlightening! Good luck!", "NTA-she is trying to manipulate you into doing what she wants by saying she won\u2019t be in your life.  Giving birth is not a spectator sport. You do what is right for you.", "NTA. \n\nThis is your pregnancy and your birth plan. It has nothing to do with your mother's wants and demands. You've set your boundaries and have been clear, repeatedly.  Stick with what *you* want. \n\nYour mom isn't owed any involvement more than you deem fit and is being manipulative and trying to emotionally blackmail you to get her way.", "NTA in the slightest. My mom had a similar attitude; that she had the \"right\" to be there. She lived an hour away, didn't drive, and wanted ME to go pick her up when I was in labour. When I shut that down, she wanted my husband to. I asked if she seriously expected him to leave me alone, drive an hour to get her, then an hour back? I told her that if she was that delusional, then she may not get to meet her grandbaby at all", "You're not wrong. Are you sure we don't share a mom? I am expecting twins. I have already stated I don't want anyone in the hospital room during my c-section or for the first month the babies (twins) are born. I know my mother will ofcourse try to force the issue by flying down, crying and other manipulative crap.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "My dog! The birth of a child is a precious, tender moment between parents to treasure in both your hearts. This will be the happiest day of your marriage.  Nobody else should be in on it if both of you wish to keep it private! You will be tired afterwards and need to sleep. Your husband will be over the moon and no doubt will want hold his child. Alone. Before the birth, you need to concentrate on each other, and yes, it will hurt. You don't need 20 people running in and out of your room, chasing your gurney down the hall to the delivery room, and hovering after! Stick to your guns and tell them no means no!", "I told my mum that every time she crossed my boundaries an extra week was added on to the length of time she was not allowed to visit she gave up when it got to 4 weeks. My husband wouldn\u2019t let her in the door when she turned up.", "NTA minimising some who thrives on emotional abuse and manipulation is a good thing. I know it sucks that it will affect your access to your siblings. Maybe you can keep in touch some way. But please don\u2019t let her manipulate you, she could do a lot of damage to your marriage and your child and they are your priority", "NTA\n\nThis is your choice, absolutely, no-one else's. You're the one doing all the hard work!\n\nWhen I had my first baby (very long and tiring birth) I had no peace at all from visitors who could just arrive at the hospital and stroll in. I actually left hospital as soon as I could, went home and didn't open the door to anyone!", "NTA\u2026 I am a labor and delivery nurse of over 20 years, and trust me, you need to STICK TO YOUR DECISION. Nobody needs to come to the hospital, including your mother. We as nurses encourage patients to just keep it to them and their partner ALL THE TIME. Mom does better, baby does better, and breastfeeding goes better. Your mom is being very manipulative, and that only reinforces that she should NOT be there. It is NOT about her, it\u2019s about you, your partner and your baby. Do NOT give in!!!", "Yes it\u2019s normal. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to bully you. After the baby is born invite them over. If she refuses, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA \n\nInfo: how old are your siblings?", "NTA at all. Your mother is a bullying narcissist.  She will continue this crap as long as you let her. The other kids will grow up seeing her actions, and they will eventually reject her, too. Temporarily,  you will be separated from some of your family. However, play the long game. You will eventually have them back in your life as they will tire of her bullying and manipulation.", "Your birth, your rules.  My husband and I are trying at the moment and we\u2019ve decided that we don\u2019t want anyone there.  Don\u2019t even want to tell anyone when we\u2019re headed to the birth because we don\u2019t want the calls.  It\u2019s a very private moment and you don\u2019t want to be stressed with visitors waiting for you to be ready.  Hold your ground, do what works for you \ud83d\ude0d I had a MC earlier in the year and felt that prepped us for how I could feel after birth.  We didn\u2019t want anyone around", "NTA. Your mother sounds insufferable with her \"it's my way or the highway\". Tell her to enjoy the highway without her first granchild. Continue to stand your ground. Don't give in to your mother's toxic, manipulative, abusive attempt at controlling your birth experience.", "I agree, this is super weird behavior from the mother. Maybe she's from the generation where men stayed out of the delivery room and it was normal to have your mother there for support? I certainly didn't want anyone other than my husband in the hospital. We even asked family not to come for the first few weeks of baby's life while we were figuring things out with the new baby, new routine, breastfeeding, recovery from giving birth, etc. It sounds like OP's mother is trying anything she can to manipulate her daughter into doing what she wants. This is incredibly toxic behavior and I would take a stand now before she starts trying to control everything about how you're caring for/ raising your child. 100% NTA", "The thing is that what your experience is with your family, is exactly that- your experience. Each mother gets to decide what kind of birth experience they want for themselves. In OPs case, she wishes to bond with the baby as an immediate family as she navigates breastfeeding for the first time. OP will also be wearing a diaper, and bleeding from the large wound on her genitals. She will be tired, she will be up every 2 hours to feed her child. OP has every right to decide what is the best way for her to navigate all these things. That does NOT make her an asshole. OPs mother is an asshole because she is leveraging her relationship over this situation because OP has made the right decision for herself.", "and if that\u2019s what your comfortable with then that\u2019s fine. But the OP isn\u2019t comfortable with that. I don\u2019t understand how protecting yourself and your new born for 2 days makes anyone TA", "Oops forgot the judgement,  NTA.", "It's up to OP but OP has to then deal with the possibility that her closest family feels slighted and rejected, which can impact their relationship in the future. OP asked, I'm giving her my opinion, and I stand by that she was being a little harsh not even letting the mom come to the hospital (before the baby shower thing anyway).\n\nBut I'll agree pulling the rug from the baby shower was a bit low on the mom's part so that could change the stance", "It is not OPs job to manage her families feelings right now, she has enough to do. If her family truly loved her they wouldn\u2019t pressure her knowing how difficult birth is."]}
