We met on a dating site and hit it off right away. Things were going great, and after about five months of dating, we took the big leap and moved in together. \n\nI am a Hindu and adhere to several religious dietary restrictions, one of which is abstaining from consuming cow meat. Cows hold great religious significance in my faith, and therefore, I cannot include beef or any cow-related products in my diet.\n\nFrom the beginning, I made it clear to Liam that my religious beliefs were of utmost importance to me and that I couldn't compromise on them. Liam is an atheist and a meat lover. I had no issue with him consuming meat as long as he didn't force it upon me or cook it at home. Initially, he respected my dietary choices when we moved in together. However, over time, he began to disregard them, despite my reminders and discussions about the matter. \n\n\nOnce he brought home a steak and used the same pots and pans as mine, and I had to end up replacing them. Initially, he was quite apologetic, but such occurrences became more frequent. He started becoming dismissive, and said that I 'should have gotten used to it by now', even though we had clearly agreed otherwise when we first moved in. It's happened three times just this month, and each time, I let it slide, thinking it was an honest mistake.\n\nNow, Liam and I love going out on dates to fancy restaurants, and we take turns paying the bill. I'm totally fine with him eating on steaks or barbecues at those places as long as they have at least a few vegan, vegetarian, or non-beef options. Last week, Liam 'surprised' me with a dinner at an extremely fancy restaurant, only to discover it was a steakhouse. \n\nWhike he ordered everything off the menu I ended up with a salad because even the fries were cooked in tallow/ beef oil. When we got home, I told him he should've been more considerate of my dietary restrictions. \nInstead, he argued, accusing me of being ungrateful for his gesture of taking me to such an expensive restaurant. I emphasized that his behavior had become disrespectful and dismissive lately, but he continued to insult me, calling me an 'ungrateful b*tch'.\n\n\nI was fed up, so I packed my bags and left. As I walked out, he called me an asshole and sent me a bunch of nasty texts the next day.\n\nLooking back, I guess I might've overreacted a bit. It's not like I should've freaked out about him going to a steakhouse. What really got to me was how he repeatedly disrespected my religious beliefs. So now I'm wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689287318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yyjyx/aita_for_moving_out_after_my_boyfriend_took_me_to/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a very good reason to get out of there.", "Nta. This isn\u2019t like a Mormon and non Mormon where one religiously drinks coffee while in the relationship and the other settles for ginger ale.

Asking why you\u2019re not over it yet as if somehow you\u2019ll grow out of this pesky religion thing and start eating cow to please him is rude at the very least.", "NTA.  I'm an atheist too, but I am respectful enough to ask my friends who have dietary restrictions due to their faith if they mind, and if they do, refrain from eating the thing.

He is passively aggressively breaking up with you, now he can whine you dumped him. What a jerk.", "NTA,NTA,NTA do not let him gaslight you to believe you are. He is only going to get worse.

Rather than openly address the major incompatibility you have as a couple, he\u2019s chipping away at you with repeated episodes of disrespect. Face it, you\u2019re done. You did NOT overreact!

When we moved in together, he studied up on the rules of kashrut so he could be absolutely certain he wouldn't contaminate any of my dishes or accidentally cook me something I couldn't eat. He eats whatever he wants when we go out, but he always makes sure to pick restaurants with vegetarian options for me.\n\n**I never had to ask him to do any of this.** I never had to remind him to pick a restaurant where I could eat. I never had to remind him to use his own pan to cook himself bacon. I never had to remind him not to make us pasta on Passover. He holds himself accountable because he loves me, he knows that keeping kosher is important to me, and most importantly he respects me. You deserve a partner who respects you too.", "NTA at all - he was deliberately doing this. Good for you for getting out", "Beef lover here and I proclaim you NTA.\n\nMembers of my family have assorted dietary restrictions, some of which are health related and some of which are purely life style.\n\nWhat I NEVER do is ignore them, whether they are life style or not. If you don\u2019t eat X because of life style, your gut bacteria changes. It ends up not being able to well tolerate the excluded foods. A vegan might lack the gut flora to digest dairy well. It won\u2019t kill them too eat it, but could cause them discomfort.\n\nThis is like taking a Jew or a Muslim to a Hog Roast.", "NTA, he clearly does not have much respect for you, and likely never did. It is not an overreaction to break up with someone who does not respect you, that is a proper reaction.", "NTA. He has zero respect for your beliefs. Not letting him cook beef at home (in pans designated for it, not the everyday ones) seems a bit much to me. I don\u2019t know very much about the Hindu faith, so it may not be.\n\nRegardless, taking you out to eat to a place where you had only one menu option was way over the line. I do have a question, though. Most steakhouses have other meats on the menu. Was the menu actually that exclusive, or is there some other reason you didn't choose, say, chicken.", "NTA.\n\nThis is just ALL the red flags. He's not just inconsiderate, he's actively disrespectful of important parts of you and your values. Don't just move out, dump him.", "He sounds horrible, controlling and clearly has significant issues with emotional/anger management.", "NTA. You two are on different paths and it is hard to be together when your aren't walking together.  Doesn't matter if it is religious, political, etc. Eventually, the respect turns to inconvenience and then to a problem. Sometimes it is quick, sometimes years.  It is hard to be with someone who doesn't hold the same values as you.", "NTA. You have clear boundaries, you're entitled to them, and you're entitled to enforce them when they are not being respected. He was clearly encroaching on them and expecting to wear them down over time. Good on you for not tolerating it.", "It's actually breaking my heart that after all of that, you still think you over reacted.. you said it yourself, he has grown dismissive and disrespectful towards you, and yet it seems like you've done nothing deserve this treatment. To be clear, no one deserves this kind of treatment period, but to try and assuage any guilt you feel over moving out, you did absolutely nothing wrong here\u2013 other than not take him seriously sooner. \n\nBy take him seriously, I mean take his words and actions seriously. He said he thought you would get use to it by now, it being him cooking beef in the home you share and using your dishes to cook with, resulting in you having to buy new ones for yourself. I think he should have gotten use to it by now, it being not eating beef inside the house/cooking it. He simply thought that with enough time passing, your religion and dietary needs wouldn't matter anymore. He was wrong. \n\nHe called you a b*tch. Because he won't respect your religion, dietary needs, or YOU. He is actively choosing to disrespect you and hurt you by not listening. He's been pushing and poking at the boundary you made the entire time, wondering where the breaking point is. Good people don't do this, they don't go searching for the moment their partners snaps on them and leaves. He's not a very good person, especially not the person for you. You deserve so much better than him, or anyone who won't respect you and your boundaries. \n\nHe's the b*tch here and you're NTA. Please don't listen to him when he says he's sorry, because it is only another way he is poking the boundary, waiting for you to come back so he can repeat the cycle.", "NTA", "NTA. He dismissed your beliefs, and that would be a deal breaker for me. Side note, I didn\u2019t know that about beef, so that was interesting to learn.", "NTA. Taking you to an expensive steakhouse isn\u2019t treating *you*, it\u2019s treating *himself* and requesting your uncomfortable companionship while doing so.

Dude get therapy if you think you overreacted and his behavior is justified. NTA but you need to figure out what\u2019s okay in a relationship and make better choices", "NTA but maybe look for someone with either similar religious views or someone who doesn't eat meat. You're doing yourself a disservice by dating someone with very different views than yours.", "NTA. He showed you who he really is:  a man made entirely of red flags.", "NTA good for you!!!! You did not over react and this relationship was dead in the water. He had no respect for you or your religion.

Living by religious guidelines that aren\u2019t yours when they\u2019re so strict you can\u2019t have meat in the home is super annoying and can be a dealbreaker for some.

Absolutely NTA, and good for you for leaving. It's sad how many posts you see from women who put up with so much, and don't seem to even consider leaving.", "NTA. It's not about the steakhouse, it's about the ongoing disrespect.", "Major ESH! You for enforcing a \u201cNo beef at home\u201d rule and dating someone who was clearly different from your religion. And him for being a major dismissive uptight asshole and thinking your religious beliefs are below him.", "He sound immature. Run", "NTA. I have friends who know I'm a hindu vegetarian and check restaurant menus beforehand and check products for gelatine/carmine before they offer it to me, even though I haven't asked them to.

In my opinion, to forbid him from cooking beef in your shared house is unfair.  If you do not wanting him to use your pans for it, that\u2019s also fine, he can buy his own for that.  \n\nBut now your boyfriend is trying to force you into giving up your beliefs by eating what he thinks is good.

His reaction to you moving out is the icing on the cake.", "omg\u2026 i would not say that you over reacted whatsoever. him taking you to a STEAKHOUSE when you don\u2019t eat any sort of beef is just straight up rude and inconsiderate and he knows it. he doesn\u2019t respect your decision to adhere to not eating beef and that\u2019s fucked up. i know it seems like such a silly thing to break up over but, you can probably imagine other instances that he would do the same thing with in the future.", "NTA, he\u2019s doing it on purpose and is manipulating you into eating beef", ">but he continued to insult me, calling me an 'ungrateful b*tch'.\n\n>I was fed up, so I packed my bags and left.

You're also not mad about the steakhouse (at least, you didn't move out because you went to a steakhouse for dinner). What it sounds like is that this man repeatedly disrespected you, your boundaries, and your beliefs, and the steakhouse was just the straw that broke the camel's back. When you didn't get upset with him and didn't leave him the first time he tested you, he got a green light in his head that he can do whatever he wants and you would just let him.
