They are. Imagine complaining about your technique instead of expressing their undying gratitude for saving their child. They really are some shitty parents.", "NTA. I have lifeguard training myself and what you did is 100% correct. People totally underestimate how much strength it costs to tug a person to safety. You also have to know the right grips and how to overwhelm a paniking person or you are just as likely to drown yourself. Without these grips you wouldn't have been able to do much anyway.\n\nOne of the first rules you learn is: Never ever endanger yourself in a way that you have to be resuced as well (more work during an emergency is really bad)\n\nAlso giving him a floatie was perfect thinking. This bought you time to get a professional while not endangering the kid.", "NTA \nI'm a Lifeguard. Drowning People sometime wanne use there Savior to stay on top of the water and cling to the Savior. If you don't know what you do, the drowning person (or kid) will drown YOU. \nLifeguards work with reach, throw, row, go. Go as normal swimming is the last option because it's the most dangerous.", "NTA why the hell is he assuming you are good enough a swimmer to save someone? Obviously you didn't jump in because you knew you weren't up to it. What an ass.", "ESH... Your actions were perfect. I learnt something new today because of this post. The dad was an asshole for his statements but I think it would've been better if you could've explained the same reasoning you've written here so that the next time it happens to them (hopefully it doesn't), they don't jump in and possibly make things worse.", "Jumping on the top comment to say that OP is ABSOLUTELY NTA and did it exactly right! If you are not trained as a lifeguard DO NOT JUMP IN THE WATER TO SAVE SOMEONE. A kickboard that he had readily available is an excellent thing to throw at the struggling swimmer before he went to get professional help!\n\nIf you don't know how to save a struggling swimmer (that is, you are not a trained lifeguard...I don't care how strong of a swimmer you are, you need more than that to help a struggling swimmer!), if you jump in, lifeguards now have \\*2\\* people to save! The struggling swimmer could easily take you under if you don't know what you're doing!\n\nI was a lifeguard from 16-24. I am still a strong swimmer. I would probably do the the same as OP today! Throw the struggler any nearby flotation device and alert lifeguards to the situation! I would only jump in and attempt a rescue myself if no lifeguards were present and it was an immediate life or death situation. I would probably still adhere to \"reach or throw, don't go\" until it became critical, since it's been forever since I was tested on actually getting a limp body out of the water, and more importantly, dealing with someone who is fighting me because they are drowning and their wits aren't about them (that was a big part of the lifeguard test...someone would pound on us, try to stuff us under the water, and we had to figure out a way to get them out of the water while they were in full panic mode attacking us because they didn't understand that we were there to help!).\n\nAlso, if you are going to reach for someone who is struggling on something like the side of the pool, SIT DOWN before you extend your hand! If you squat on the edge, you are likely to be pulled in as they struggle! That was one of our first lessons as a lifeguard...this big burly guy would squat on the edge of the pool, reach his hand out to the smallest woman bobbing in the shallow end, and demonstrate that she could pull him head first into the pool with little effort in that position!", "Yup, I nearly drowned when I was 9 cause I got myself in to deep water when I couldn\u2019t really swim well (had been doing well in the shallow pool so went in the big one) a kid tried to help me and I nearly drowned him too, his grandmother dived in and manhandled me out the pool basically. I am still grateful to this day that this strange woman did that, even though she hurt me a little, I\u2019m alive, and I still feel guilty as well that I nearly killed another kid.", "Drowning folk have no friends. Their mind is not in a logical place and they will take you down with them in their panic.", "Not only that, but I don\u2019t know about your instructor, but mine spent a decent chunk of time basically drilling us on water wrestling techniques so if a panicked drowner DID get ahold of us we knew how to escape so we could re-approach safely instead of struggling with them.\n\nStuff op wouldn\u2019t have known how to do", "Same here. I understand freezing when faced with danger to my own person, but watching my child drown? No fing way.", "You do hours of training how to get out of the clinging hands of a panicking person and more hours of training how to transport them. No layman should ever attempt a rescue. \n\nThrow a floatie. Get help. In that order.", "Well, I was never trained to wait until the victim was unconscious, but those big red flotation devices are on the lifeguards' laps for a reason. Get to the victim, stuff it under them, drag them to the side. If they fight you, do a side-kick with them in a head lock (getting them to safety is more important than whether they briefly lose consciousness due to your arm around their neck!). If they're close to the edge of the pool, no shame in diving under, grabbing their legs, and just thrusting them onto the pool deck! They shouldn't mind the scraped face because it saved them from, you know, dying from breathing in water...", "I was trained to approach them from behind and grab them before they could turn around.  If they did grab you, I was trained to do the \"tuck, grab, suck, duck, chuck\" method.  Tuck your chin so they don't punch you in the nose, grab their arms if they've wrapped them around you, suck in a breath of air, and duck under water.  The last thing a panicked swimmer wants to do is go under, so they typically let go, if they didn't, we were to pinch them in the back of their elbows and trigger the \"funny bone\", then they reflexively let go and you throw them off of you while swimming away from them.", "NTA and you did the right thing.\n\nI wouldn't judge the father too harshly though, people do get scared and act stupid but that's his mess to deal with. Hopefully he learns something from this accident for the future.", "Nta. You did well mate", "NTA", "Definitely NTA - if they were that worried they could have gone in themselves!", "NTA. At least you did something instead of nothing. Good on you for calling it out", "Fuck those idiots, why didn't one of *them* jump in instead of waiting for you to save the day? Stupid, entitled *and* ungrateful.\n\nNTA", "I suspect they were terrified and were yelling at what was in their face.  Of course you are NTA.  (and I may be adding what a bunch of idiots in my head)\n\nNote to self: look into relationship dynamics when a freezer (fight, flight, freeze) marries a freezer.", "NTA  Those parents have no business being parents if they would not jump into a pool and rescue their own child and then rag on you for not jumping in.  What FOOLS I feel sorry for the kid.", "I am a strong swimmer - swim 1.2 miles in the ocean against current kind of strong. I swim 2-3 times a week.\n\nI have a five year old daughter. She weighs 45 lbs. I can barely keep my head above water swimming with her on my back (we tried in a 4 ft pool where I can easily just stand).\n\nYou did the right thing.", "Nta that kid has terrible parents. Good on you for saving his life they would of let him die", "NTA!\n\nYou saved a life and that's all that matters. The parents were probably in shock and were in a heat of the moment situation and didn't really mean to snap at you at the way they did.", "NTA- You did what you were supposed to do.  I know sometimes fear can leave someone feeling paralyzed, but dad has no right to be mad at you when 1) He didn't go in himself (but apparently that was \"your job\") and 2) Neither him or mom went to a lifeguard for help.\n\nAnd that leaves me to think what could've ended up happening if you hadn't been there, so he should be beyond grateful that you did something to save his kid.\n\nYou're definitely NTA, but dad certainly is.  And I don't want to necessarily call the lifeguard who went and got the kid out of the water an AH, **but** that's concerning if people are screaming and a child is drowning, and no lifeguard stepped in until you did something.", "NTA. They couldn't do ANYTHING? \n\nSimilar situation, my brother jumped into a fairly fast moving stream when we saw a little girl go under. He pulled her out and the parents never noticed, then proceeded to yell at her for being away from them. I'm not sure they ever knew what happened.", "NTA. You did well, congratulations.", "The lifeguard wasnt doing his job because he had to be called to save the kid. The parents didnt attempt to help their own son or go search for the lifeguard. You were a stranger that give the kid something to help him float and went find the person that wasnt doing his job you are NTA the rest of them are the AH", "NTA. \n\nYou helped save their son, they shouldn't have criticized how you went about doing it.\n\nYes, sometimes we get paralyzed and don't know what to do. But clearly they weren't making enough commotion for the lifeguard to hear or see the kid drowning.\n\nIf you aren't a lifeguard, or a strong swimmer, or know first aid, you didn't need to be the one jumping in there to save the kid the way the lifeguard did.\n\nYou did the right thing. Lifeguards are trained for that sort of thing.", "NTA A drowning person can definitely drown YOU trying to keep their head above water. Your gf was right. And as far as saying \"at least I did something,\" you're right, they're being choosey beggars. You didn't have to do anything. They did because they have a duty as parents. You didn't have to get involved at all.", "I was trained as a life guard and the first step in a rescue was always try to provide a floatation device before risking person. You did everything right as untrained bystander in this situation. NTA and I wouldn't feel bad about the comment, emotions skyrocket during stuff like that.", "I would say a very light Y T A  or E S H. Can't decide \ud83d\ude05\n\nI understand the panicking from the parents and just freezing, But yelling at you was not ok, questionning what you did when you saved his child not ok either. Yet it might come from the aftermath of the chock. \n\nThat said you had a great reaction, you did what was needed and that was awesome but shouting at them was not ok. But I can understand your reaction from your stress and just having acted. It might make them feel a lot more guilty though\n\nMy final rulling is NAH a very stressful and scary situation", "NTA. But those parents sure are.", "As they stood there motionless", "Get therapy.", ">\"Panicked\" people are clearly allowed to act how they want to\n\nUm, no they're not. Sure, yelling-from a distance-is fine bc no ome's getting hurt or anything, but it's not like they're allowed to go crazy like destroy property or something. \n\n>as you can see from the replies on here, no one will have your back if another dad takes his \"panic\" so far as to be violent.\n\nThese replies don't have anything to do with how ppl who are actually witnissing the situation will react. Plenty of ppl are willing to step in and stop a fight, or call the authorities-whichever they feel safest doing. The lifeguard present is definitely not going to be able to just sit there and do nothing but watch. \n\n>They will let him do what he wants to you and tell you you should just be happy it wasn't worse because he was \"panicking\".\n\nUm, are you high or something? That's not at all what ppl would be saying if they saw the dad try to fight OP. Even if not everyone there would be willing to step in and stop a physical fight, no one would say he was happy it wasn't worse. They'd see the guy help the kid and be on his side. I have no idea where you're getting this idea, bc ppl usually have more sympathy for the victim than the assaulter, especially if the assaulter is attacking someone who helped save a drowning kid.", "Yes. My sister\u2019s dear friend died this way as a fit 21 year old. After rescuing several people from a rip tide, the last person he attempted to rescue inadvertently drowned him by climbing on him before drowning herself. It happened this time of year. Hard to believe he\u2019s been gone 25 years now. RIP Dan; you were a hero and people still think of you often.", "Even as a lifeguard I never jumped in for a save except in training. Lots of save. All were done with shepherds crooks in pools or swimming areas of lakes.\n\nThe safest way is the driest way.", "That might excuse them freezing, it doesnt excuse them berating OP.", "Clearly, since he stood there like a useless lump the entire time", "I, too, had to rescue a younger sibling and mom didn't help.  I already commented the story in this thread so I'll just try to summarize.  Basically jumped in for brother, he pushed me under and all I could do from that point was start pushing him as hard and as far to the shallow end as I could.  Kept repeating that process til he was good, but it seemed like I was underwater for hours when it happened.", "'No adults around' Ah, the good old 1970s. I remember looking out the window with my brother one morning, after a heavy storm, seeing that the cliff across the lagoon had fallen down, and saying to my brother 'Let's go play on the landslide.'", "And the 1980s - them there were golden days!\n\nNo adult supervision and the world was our oyster. \n\nNTA.", "Amazing! Why is this not on the school curriculum? (My school had a pool). It would be way more useful than just learning butterfly and crawl.", "To be fair, born in the 90s and was trusted as a teen as long as I took my damn younger brother with me... moron wouldn't listen to me, went beyond his ability to *prove he could*, nearly took us both under as he panicked in a rip tide and I went after him. \n\n\nNever have I felt so exhausted as I did after finally getting us both back on the beach - and I have kids! Also, he has never again swam at a beach.\n\n\nNTA", "Because then you have a bunch of minimally trained kids thinking they can be heroes.", "Whoa, now that's a tale. Glad you both survived and that you got to experience the freedom of being a kid. \n\nI live in the UK, and there was a programme probably on 5-0 years on TV that I've only managed to catch once or twice. But it has a number of family units and shows them living in different time periods. I caught the 1970s/80s and the children on the show got to out after school without adult supervision. I remember one of the little girls on the show saying how much she loved the freedom. It made me sad.", "Fair point."]}
