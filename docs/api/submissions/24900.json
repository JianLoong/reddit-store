My ex is the type to just freeze if anything happens to our kid but I'm the one who behaves calm and ready for emergency situations. I'm first aid trained and he isn't and I think you're right, it does lend a kind of confidence.", "No.. I should clarify if my point was not clear.

But the little girl died in that movie -  glad you were able to save the baby!!", "Yeah that's what my 6th grade teacher said.  He was a lifeguard by profession, and taught middle school as his side job.   \n\nHe always said a sharp elbow to the nose would disrupt the flailing long enough to get behind them and put them into the float position.  He also had been unsuccessfully sued twice.", "Hilarious, I was trained by pool lifeguards.  So it's entirely likely that there's a bunch of people taught wrong.\n\nThough I will say, we were taught that if you have to approach someone conscious, that you should push a flotation device at them with your foot.  That came after the whole \"Throw the ring at them and pull them in if they grab it\"", "Really, someone's untrained friend is qualified to throw a ring, but a semi-trained lifeguard isn't?", "SAME lol I had to re-read it a couple of times to understand it because the first mental image was just...", "Okay but for future reference ESH means Everyone in the story is an asshole.

The twins, around two, had started playing closer and closer to the pond, and that second, no one watched. I am not a competent swimmer at all. But adrenaline made me push the other kid further back while I waded into the water very quickly and pulled him out, approaching him from behind. He hadn\u2019t ingested water yet or not much, and I had been fast. So nothing happened.\n\nIt was automatic, and pure instinct. The parents were grateful.

I loved it. The final test was to tread water for 10-15 minutes without touching the wall. I like to think the training does help and save lives. \n\nI still love the water and prefer to swim in deep Lakes.", "NTA\n\nIf you can't swim well and you jumped in, two people could have drowned while they stood there panicking. Drowning people tend to grab, and even seasoned swimmers can be drowned trying to rescue someone who is panicking in the water. They often bring a flotation device for the victim to grab, too. You did things right.\n\nI get they were upset. I get fight, flight, fawn, and freeze. But getting mad at you for not putting yourself in danger is unreasonable.", "You did perfect. Way to be smart and save the kids life, and keep yourself safe! NTA", "You did the right thing. And I\u2019m sorry. If my kid is in danger, I would never be too scared. I\u2019m terrified of heights but I would climb whatever to help him. Dad is projecting his guilt onto you.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Putting yourself in danger just means two people to rescue instead of one.\n\nThey were just lashing out in fear. Shrug it off, you helped save that kid's life.", "NTA! The father is an AS?!!?$!", "I was not a great swimmer but adequate for myself. A friend jumped off the high dive for his first time and froze after diving. I look and see he froze, and I look over to the lifeguard who also froze. So I jumped in to get him. Now here is why you don't do what I did. When I got to him, he lunges at me and wrapped his arms around my neck. Well you can't swim, with you facing someone with their arms around your neck. and we both started to go down. So I push him with all my might up out of the water and toward the pool edge under the lifeguard. When I pushed him up, I went under. He went about 1-2 ft and we had 12 to go. So I do it again, the lifeguard is still frozen. Then again and again.  I get close about 3 ft away and yell to the lifeguard get the hook and help me. She finally shakes out of it and got down to help. I was close to petering out and had little strength left to get him out of the pool.", "NTA. You saved the kid while his parents did nothing", "NTA. When I was in the 6th grade, my orchestra dedicated our concert to a peer who tried to jump into a lake to save a 4yo that was drowning. The kid lived but she drowned trying to get him out of the water because she wasn\u2019t a strong swimmer. She was only 12. Completely reasonable response from you. \n\nParents are the AH for literally doing NOTHING and watching their own kid struggle then shaming the person who threw him a floatation device before getting help. I feel like they could have done that as the bare minimum if they were so paralyzed they couldn\u2019t get their asses in the water themselves.", "NTA and you are a hero. I will cut the parents some slack in that they likely were in shock that they almost lost their child - they're likely consumed with guilt that they did not prevent this, and are looking for someone, anyone to take the blame because they cannot stomach the failure themselves. I'm proud of you op- and your girlfriend gave good advice.", "I almost drowned at 14 at a family friend's house because of this. I was at the deep end trying to get courage to swim more. So was an older adult friend of the family (40s). She nearly took me out when her hands slipped off the side of the pool and started freaking grabbing the nearest thing, me. To this day I have a deep seated fear of deep ends.", "The parents were panicking and useless.  Instead of admitting they were wrong after you saved their son!!!, they again panicked and blamed you.  Scared people aren\u2019t always logical.  \n\nOP you did great.", "Yeah, I took the training as a teenager. We were literally taught to swim fast until you\u2019re just out of their reach, and then flip over and approach feet first (pushing the flotation device forward with your foot). If they ever try to grab YOU instead of the device, KICK THEM IN THE FACE AS HARD AS YOU CAN AND MOVE AWAY. Repeat until you get them to take the device or they lose consciousness and you can safely bring them to shore. \n\nDrowning people will panic and drag you under, your first priority is making sure you\u2019re able to get YOURSELF to safety.", "Right! Even if you are a good swimmer, don't go in the pool if you don't have too. You are right there watching the kid in the pool. You can assess the situation.

Then we were able to get a hold of them and haul them back on board. \n\nBest part: they had a properly fitted and buoyant life jacket! They weren't gonna sink, and they're a strong swimmer anyway! But the unexpected water in their face (went in head first originally) was enough to make them completely lose their shit.", "Yeah, anyone being told to wait until someone is unconscious to rescue them is being trained wrong. There are a lot of incompetent lifeguard instructors out there, that\u2019s for sure. If you can reach or throw something to someone, that is definitely a great first option. But if it is too far and you need to swim to them, you can submerge the guard tube and shove it under the person\u2019s arms.

I have so many questions!", "NAH. You did the right thing. Unless you are properly trained to pull a panicking person out of the water, you\u2019ll probably do more harm than good. Tossing a float is safer for all of you, including the guard because he may have ended up having to pull both of you out when the kid tried to drown you. \n\nI won\u2019t call the dad as asshole either, though. A frantic parent isn\u2019t thinking logically. Once he\u2019d had time to calm down, he probably wouldn\u2019t have said that to you. I used to work at a hotel pool, so we made sure everyone who worked a job touching the deck knew at least basic CPR and first aid. We had a baby swallow some coins, and the grandmother panicked. One of our bartenders ran over to perform the Heimlich, and she literally had to fight the grandma to get the kid out of her hands so she could help. She basically had to punch an old lady so she could do what she needed to do. The kid ended up being fine, and the family came back later to apologize.", "How is OP supposed to know the answers to your questions?", "I know people can't necessarily predict how they'll react in an emergency, but I secretly judge them for reacting wrong in certain cases. Like - I doubt the parents had any control over themselves in that moment, but I feel judgmental anyway. And really, I think the reason they were yelling at OP was because they were also judging themselves. They were ashamed. I'd feel pretty bad about my failure if I were them. \n\nOn that note, we do have a significant amount of influence on how we'll behave in emergencies. We can't do much to change our reaction in the moment itself - by then, it's kind of too late - but we can do a whole lot if we mentally prepare beforehand. \n\nFor instance, in the case of the parents, they could have learned how to swim if they didn't know how (which is unknown to us Redditors). Then, they could have practiced quickly jumping into a pool to go retrieve something from the water. They could have imagined the scenario of their child drowning and imagined themselves running to the water, jumping in, and properly grabbing their flailing child. \n\nIf they'd done all that, the mental training probably would have kicked in and allowed them to save their child in real life.", "I hope the parents in this story and anyone reading this take it as a sign to look into first aid, in water and otherwise. \n\nWe're putting together a fire plan at my house and though imagining the worst is unpleasant it's a relief to have a plan.", "For me it was just that that was me and dad\u2019s favorite thing to do in the pool growing up (he\u2019d flip me through the water as I tried to restrain/tip him, even as early as 8, but he knew well how to do this all safely) and it was something so ingrained that when I got to my lifeguard course and the teacher went over stuff I was the only one who could escape his \u2018demonstration\u2019 without help", "I was told (1969) to keep something between the victim and you.

Mum's parenting talk was; you can do what you want, so long as you can look your grandmother in the eye when she inevitably asks you questions about the gossip she heard. \n\n\nI think that was a pretty decent level of freedom, and thankfully Nan was a pretty cool woman. However I didn't feel the need to experiment with alcohol until I was over the legal age and moved out of town!!", "NTA  You did the right thing too.
