If you are not competent to rescue do not attempt to rescue.  Lots of cases of parents drowning to try to save a child.\n\nSo if you weren\u2019t a good enough swimmer to rescue someone and you need to keep in mind that a person who is drowning will try to drown you in a panic as you try to rescue them so being able to swim pretty good isn\u2019t enough then doing what you did is the best option.\n\nGood for you for not panicking and for remembering good advice for what to do in an emergency.", "NTA. You ended up rescuing the kid through your actions and acted on the great advice of your sister.\n\nEdit to add: people react differently in tense situations. Brush the parents reaction off, you did good. The kid is alive because of you.", "NTA every class I've ever had, including lifeguard certification, tells you never to just jump in. Panicked people are very dangerous. \n\nLifeguards go in and toss a flotation device or a buoy with handles, to the person in distress. They don't just swim to them with nothing, nor do they get too close. \n\nYou did exactly the right thing.\n\nAnd good job assessing your girlfriend's and your actual ability realistically like that, not letting your masculine impulse get you in trouble.", "NTA. I get that people freeze sometimes, so I won't judge them too harshly.

I am pretty shocked a mother didn\u2019t jump in after her child.", "NTA if you don't know how to help people who drowning the best choice is call for safeguard. You did the best in this situation if you jump in yourself your might don't do right way and put both of you in danger.", "NTA - Reach, Throw, Row, Go is the first thing taught in life guarding classes.

One of the first things to do is blame others than yourself. They felt bad for not even trying to save their own kid and that some bystander had to step in. And you did step in and save the kid. I notice a lot of stories being \"was I the ahole/bad for saving the person in this scenario?\" And the answer is always no, you are never bad for saving the life of a living being. But we have the stages of grief for a reason. They apply to even outside of death. And this applies to you right now.

I hope that facility reassesses their guard situation.", "NTA !", "Oh no you fine. I think you had a right to defend yourself. The parent was just struggling to find an outlet for their feeling useless while their kid was in trouble, and unfortunately, he picked you as his outlet. You saved the kid\u2019s life and deserve just as much credit for that as a lifeguard does. Also, for someone who is not a lifeguard or trained and saving people, it can actually be more dangerous for you to jump in yourself to help them. That\u2019s how secondary drownings happen. Hopefully the father, if you ever see him again, will apologize. Parents do crazy things when their kids are in trouble. Don\u2019t take his outburst personally. You did good.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  They're just taking their self loathing out on you.  You don't need to coddle them for failing to act on their son's drowning.

Maybe they'll do better next time.", "This! Congrats OP, the parents may not say it but you are a hero. You did something amazing.

People do crazy things when they\u2019re scared or frightened. We all can agree that dad should apologize and that being scared or frightened for his son\u2019s life did not excuse yelling at the person who assisted in saving his kids life, but he is still a dad who watched his kid almost die. I think we can cut him a little slack. Also, congrats to OP for saving somebody\u2019s life! That\u2019s not a badge that anybody wants to receive, but it is a badge that OP should wear with pride!", "Uh huh tell me so much more about what you know about human nature. And then how much it varies from whatever else you happen to say bud.", "Ahhh, look.  I've been on site for a few accidents.  I've had a guy full of adrenaline freak out on me - and then just faint!  It messes up your whole ability to process things rationally.  Honestly, people in the accident seem to sometimes handle it better than bystanders, especially if they are emotionally involved.  Yeah, lashing out in fight/flight/lots of swirly hormones making you go nuts is actually pretty normal.\n\nThat isn't to say it's nice, right or good.  But.  It's not at all unusual and I've seen it a bunch of times.  Heck, I've seen assholes who suddenly switched to being accommodating and nice, who were assholes again afterwards.\n\nPeople who are freaking out don't think.
