They are being selfish, and you are absolutely right to stick with your original plans.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents sound like entitled AHs though.  This date means a lot and if they really care about you then they will accommodate.  I would be prepared for them not to attend.

It's a yoga retreat, not a major life event. And you offering to pay for the change was very nice, considering the alternative. \n\nBut I'm also gonna say you're being a little unreasonable. If you were rushing to have the wedding because someone was terminally ill, or there was something special like a solar eclipse happening the day of the wedding, I could see why you'd be so specific. But like... 9 months is a pretty short amount of time considering all of the planning that you'll have to do, and the planning that your friends and family will have to do. This is the person you're gonna spend of the rest of your life with.

As the oldest there was a certain amount of fending for oneself because \"don't bother us, we have the little ones to think about\". In adulthood, a move to the other side of the world to start afresh, abusive (DV) marriage, now divorced, a JustNoMiL to deal with, depression, anxiety, decade-long estrangement from my dad and then he died before we were able to reconnect.\n\nAll of that is shit, but I have had a LOT of therapy and I have good people around me. I have triggers that I recognise and deal with and sometimes can lapse into melancholy (depression hasn't reared its head since my split from my husband - strange that), but pretty much OK - life is good. Nothing like half the drama I read about on here.\n\nI also look to this sub for tips on how not to behave regarding blended families (myself and partner have two kids each). So it's educational!"]}
