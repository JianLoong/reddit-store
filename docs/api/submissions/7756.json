They are being selfish, and you are absolutely right to stick with your original plans.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents sound like entitled AHs though.

It's a yoga retreat, not a major life event. And you offering to pay for the change was very nice, considering the alternative. \n\nBut I'm also gonna say you're being a little unreasonable. If you were rushing to have the wedding because someone was terminally ill, or there was something special like a solar eclipse happening the day of the wedding, I could see why you'd be so specific. But like... 9 months is a pretty short amount of time considering all of the planning that you'll have to do, and the planning that your friends and family will have to do. This is the person you're gonna spend of the rest of your life with. If the date is *that* important, why not postpone the wedding another year?\n\nEDIT: Your downvotes make me stronger.", "Against the grain, but YTA. Your mom has something planned that she already put money into and/or would lose money to move.

Yes your wedding is important, but so is her pre-booked trip.

I like it.", "No, hire male and female yoga instructors and give them shirts that say \u201cmom\u201d and \u201cdad\u201d to do poses in. Lol.", "Dad's not even going, so have to figure out another way to represent him. Sitting in front of a TV?", "Lol I just saw these yoga frog statues at rite aid and I am now picturing those in the chairs.\n\nNTA- I\u2019m sorry your parents are putting their own selfish desires over their child\u2019s wedding but I wouldn\u2019t move it to accommodate them. \n\nClearly this Just isn\u2019t a priority for them. Have a beautiful wedding, don\u2019t try to rearrange one of the most important days of your life for someone who doesn\u2019t see the significance of it.", "Save the seating, get life sized picture boards. Creepier the look on their face, the better! \n\nI originally thought formal wear , but yoga clothes would be appropriate here.", "Draw faces on the balloons!", "LoL, fixed, but I'm now thinking that whenever they try to contact, OP needs to put fingers to ears and sing IANTA over and over again until they go away.", "*applause*", "No fucking wonder i never have shit to post about on here. God damn.\n\nETA: Sorry, didn't mean to flex on you guys with all my healthy relationships", "True, my Dad had to hire a private ambulance but he made it to my wedding. There was no stopping him. \n\nMy parents made a ton of mistakes and communicated mostly through either yelling or hugging but none of the extreme selfishness or vindictiveness like some of the parents on here.", "... or a male friend dressed as a yoga instructor.", "Maybe I've seen too much reddit bs however part of me really wonders if the yoga retreat was booked before the announcement or if op's mom booked it after hearing the date...", "If it's half the wedding budget the parents might feel bad.", "Narcissism probably", "It's their own damn wedding why would you need to run it by anyone, come on now.", "Yeah there is the pandemic-fallout of a ton of post-poned weddings but location is still a factor. \n\nWe had a long engagement and by the end O felt like I was losing my mind.\n\nI have a friend who planned her wedding in 2 weeks. It was an off-season Sunday wedding with a lunch reception but it was stunning.", "Read OP's post from a few months ago. Their parents have zero interest in making any effort in OP's life but OP is responsible for bending to all their whims. If they did move the date, I'm sure a few days out they would be contacting that u/friendlylocalnpc needed to move the wedding again because an appointment just opening up at mom's manicurist. NTA OP.", "The paid for it part is irrelevant considering OP offered to reimburse her.", "How about a downward-facing dog away from cameras", "LMAO I AM HERE FOR THIS PETTINESS", "I feel like that would be cheaper than half their budget. Either Op is on a super shoestring budget or this retreat is da bomb if rescheduling is half a wedding budget", "Or a photo of their faces taped to the ballons", "Hahahaha that's amazing, that may be the best way to 'go NTA' with someone hahaha", "I have a few shitty relationships, particularly with one aunt and one cousin, and even my sister, but I've been reassured by the rest of my family that I am NTA, and I'm LC with Aunt and Cousin and NC with Sister.

They don't get to make demands if OP is happy with doing that.", "I guess I am in the minority on this. \n\n\nFor me, I would rather touch base with both sets of parents and siblings if you have a close relationship with.  I am close with my family. I couldn't imagine picking a day that conflicts with something they had booked. It's so much different if it's far away, but rushing it simply for the anniversary date isn't good enough for me to discount our families.\n\n\nAs I mentioned 9 months, it's possible trips have been planned or other obligations.  If you don't care about having your family there, then it's a non-issue.", "Me too. We cleared the date with all immediate family before confirming. With three siblings in healthcare, figuring out a date that worked was the hardest part of wedding planning."]}
