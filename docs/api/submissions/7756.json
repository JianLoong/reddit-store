If your mother puts a yoga retreat over your wedding date, then that's on her.

I cannot FATHOM being a parent and putting a freaking yoga retreat above my daughter? Blegh.", "NTA.  Your parents are being absurdly self-centered.  The polite thing for them to do would be to reschedule or cancel the retreat without ever telling you so as not to impinge on your wedding planning excitement. \n\nJust to make sure, because this is honestly so over-the-top it\u2019s baffling to me - is your mom *attending* the retreat, or is she leading it?", "NTA.  You offered an extremely reasonable compromise (paying for them to change dates).  There will be other retreats.  There will only be one wedding (hopefully).  They are being selfish, and you are absolutely right to stick with your original plans.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents sound like entitled AHs though.  This date means a lot and if they really care about you then they will accommodate.  I would be prepared for them not to attend.  Stick to your guns this is your day and you deserve for it to be on a day that means a lot to you.\n\nYes you were right in them saying they care more about Yoga than you.\n\nAlso if they come back wanting you to pay to change the date of their Yoga retreat inform them that it was a one time offer that is no longer available.", "My mom did the exact same shit. Our anniversary fell on the weekend so we planned the wedding for that day. We were asked to change the date for similarly nonsensical \u201cconflicts.\u201d I said no.

It's a yoga retreat, not a major life event. And you offering to pay for the change was very nice, considering the alternative. \n\nBut I'm also gonna say you're being a little unreasonable. If you were rushing to have the wedding because someone was terminally ill, or there was something special like a solar eclipse happening the day of the wedding, I could see why you'd be so specific. But like... 9 months is a pretty short amount of time considering all of the planning that you'll have to do, and the planning that your friends and family will have to do. This is the person you're gonna spend of the rest of your life with. If the date is *that* important, why not postpone the wedding another year?\n\nEDIT: Your downvotes make me stronger.", "Against the grain, but YTA. Your mom has something planned that she already put money into and/or would lose money to move. That\u2019s why you check with close family and friends you really want to be there before setting everything in stone, especially when planning a wedding on shorter than average notice. Yes your wedding is important, but so is her pre-booked trip.

Here it goes.\n\n\nWhen you plan a wedding, you need to make sure your VIP people can make the date. 9 months out some.have booked vacations or have other responsibilities.  That will cost tons of money and time to fix.\n\n\nIf your mother is a VIP for you, then you should have asked. Sorry, not sorry. \n\nObviously, you can not cater towards everyone but your mother?
