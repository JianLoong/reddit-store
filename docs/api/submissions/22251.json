I agree with the other poster who said they would have left as soon as they realized it was the same place just to avoid the details you are leaving out or glossing over\n\nI assume you know more of the people at that dinner than just the bride, and inevitably when they saw you and started talking to you it was stealing the focus from the wedding party.  I sense that's exactly what happened, when you were on the dance floor some of the wedding party joined you and thus their nice, intimate rehearsal dinner got derailed. Plenty of time to get drunk and dance at the reception after the wedding. The rehearsal dinner is for the closest of the close people to the wedding party to have that time to talk, catch up, be with each other, etc without the distraction of the reception around them.", "NTA you went to a bar and had fun. It was coincidentally the same place a friend was at with their family. The reason for them being there is irrelevant. People other than brides are allowed to go to bars and have fun. The brides do not own all the rights to going to bars, having fun, getting drunk, chatting to other people at those bars and dancing to music. It sounds like a great night. \n\nIf the bride wanted nobody else to be there then she should have booked a private venue or had it in someone\u2019s home.", "Me too", "There is nothing else I could think of\nGoing to that bar was a coincidence because none of us know that the dinner was  happening there.\nWe all got mad drunk and I didn't even try to engage with the bride's family.", "If it's a small town, there may be other bars but this one might be the \"good one\".", "I\u2019m from saskatoon and most small towns only have one bar.

Do you think the bar or the church has better attendance?", "Because I would want to be a good friend and not be around where I wasn\u2019t invited.

OP was one of those random people.", "This is the way NTA", "I\u2019m just that type of person.  It\u2019s one thing to be freer with your family and strangers around, than knowing you know someone there who has friends watching your group.", "Let's be honest here:  If you being in a the same bar with her was enough to \"steal her thunder\" it doesn't sound like she had very much thunder in the first place.

So I don't see how anyone would know you were a guest at the wedding.  (yea some of the guests might know you--SO WHAT!)\n\n\\#4  Was she dancing too?  Do you twerk better than she does?  What is the issue with you dancing?  Were all her guests(and fianc\u00e9) drooling over your HOT moves?  I don't even get the problem here.  Can you spell it out for me(if she spelt it out for you).\n\nIS she even worth your fretting about her messages?  At this point I'd be taking the gift and offering to friend who gave me a really good evening out and bunk off on the wedding.", "How did you \"steal her thunder???\" Dang her I was thinking maybe you announced your pregnancy, got engaged, something at her wedding/reception! Having drinks and partying at the same place she was at (that you were strictly not invited to) is not stealing her thunder!\n\nOH WAIT! YOU HAD FUN!! AND IT SHOWED!!!

That would entertain me.", "Okay... how drunk is mad drunk? \n\nMaybe she is being ridiculous, or maybe you were way drunker than you think.", "You said in original post she contacted you the night after which would have been after the wedding.", "That sounds even worse then. If they were having a small intimate dinner it would have been better to leave, or at least follow your first instinct to stay out of sight and off to the side.", "I mean not really but I'm just trying to figure out the whole \"stole my thunder\" thing.", "Yeah I don\u2019t understand how that comment has 30 upvotes.

I really don't think that is a normal reaction.", "They didn't go there to watch the bride and her family like some sort of live entertainment. \nNo one was watching them. So that's not really a point.\n\nThat's like saying everyone there was watching them, which is also not what was happening. \n\n\nI for one have certainly never watched a friend when I happen to be in the same public space as them. That's an odd thing to do or think people are doing.", "I guess I respect privacy.  \n\nI just think that for me personally, it\u2019s really important in my relationships with my friends.  I would have suggested to the other friends that I would like to please change venues as I would have been more protective of my bride friend, for this one night.  Maybe the family didn\u2019t want friends there, to distract the bride from her family.  It doesn\u2019t matter why, really, I would respect my friends wishes.  To make sure her party is free from any prying eyes that may ask questions or gossip about her later.  \n\nI have only a few friends but they are long term, the newest being only 20 years.  The other two are over 42 years.  We trust we have each others back.", "If it\u2019s truly a small town and it\u2019s like the only bar, the bride doesn\u2019t get dibs on the only bar in town.", "NTA - you didn't steal her thunder at all.  You coincidentally ended up at the same spot and had fun with your own friends.\n\nHowever, YTA for not saying hello and laughing over your ending up in the same spot.

How](https://story.How) did she say you stole her thunder?", "Where is this bar/church stop out of curiosity?

You never know.", "That's why there are private venues to be rented out. There is zero expectation of privacy in a public space. If the bride was concerned about other people being there, she could have rented that bar out so that it was closed to the Public.", "I\u2019m not saying that they had an expectation of privacy.  I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s what I would do.  I don\u2019t know why the bride got upset, unless she is like me, and maybe would have done the same.", "NTA\nIt's a public place you had a right to be.... and it's not like you upstaged her at her wedding.", "The real question is: were you wearing white?", "Later that same night, I believe.", "NTA. How could you \"steal her thunder\" unless she somehow expected everyone in the bar to spend all night buying her drinks and congratulating her and somehow instead people talked to you? And danced themselves instead of with her?", "It sounds like the bride is more upset that you were having more fun than she was."]}
