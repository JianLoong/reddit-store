You didn\u2019t steal her thunder it\u2019s a local bar and she\u2019s only bitter because she knows you and has someone to blame. What would she have done if it was someone else ? Nothing.", "LOL She chose to have dinner in a public place, if she wanted a private dinner she could have rented the hole place or do it on a house. \n\nAlso why did you feel you had to hide from her when you arrived at the (very public) bar? \n\nNTA .", "NTA\n\nYou didn't know she would be there and you had fun with the people you went with plus a few others.\n\nIf she went to a bar with music for this dinner, that was her choice, no matter if she knew other people than her wedding party there or not.", "NTA - Just because she knows you, doesnt mean that you stole her thunder.

Did your friend and ex coworkers know that you weren\u2019t invited to that party so decided to make yourselves a spectacle and draw attention to yourself more?

What would happen if it was a random person \"stealing her thunder\"? Would she send them a message that it was her party and they stole her thunder?", "we're you in all white? \ud83d\ude05  we have to me missing something.", "NTA, you were free to be there but also free to face the consequences.  I agree with the other poster who said they would have left as soon as they realized it was the same place just to avoid the details you are leaving out or glossing over\n\nI assume you know more of the people at that dinner than just the bride, and inevitably when they saw you and started talking to you it was stealing the focus from the wedding party.  I sense that's exactly what happened, when you were on the dance floor some of the wedding party joined you and thus their nice, intimate rehearsal dinner got derailed. Plenty of time to get drunk and dance at the reception after the wedding. The rehearsal dinner is for the closest of the close people to the wedding party to have that time to talk, catch up, be with each other, etc without the distraction of the reception around them.", "NTA you went to a bar and had fun. It was coincidentally the same place a friend was at with their family. The reason for them being there is irrelevant. People other than brides are allowed to go to bars and have fun. The brides do not own all the rights to going to bars, having fun, getting drunk, chatting to other people at those bars and dancing to music. It sounds like a great night. \n\nIf the bride wanted nobody else to be there then she should have booked a private venue or had it in someone\u2019s home.", "Me too", "There is nothing else I could think of\nGoing to that bar was a coincidence because none of us know that the dinner was  happening there.\nWe all got mad drunk and I didn't even try to engage with the bride's family.", "If it's a small town, there may be other bars but this one might be the \"good one\".", "I\u2019m from saskatoon and most small towns only have one bar. Heck, we even had bars that don\u2019t even have a town!

She doesn't own the bar. If she wanted a private event, she should have been in a private space.", "Lol, that's awesome. Do you think the bar or the church has better attendance?", "Because I would want to be a good friend and not be around where I wasn\u2019t invited.  Give them their anonymity.", "> not be around where I wasn\u2019t invited\n\nOP was invited there by the friend.", "It's a public bar/restaurant you don't need to be invited.  If the bride wanted to control attendance, maybe she should have booked a private venue.", "What anonymity since it was a public bar where random peope come and go. OP was one of those random people.", "This is the way NTA", "I\u2019m just that type of person.  It\u2019s one thing to be freer with your family and strangers around, than knowing you know someone there who has friends watching your group."]}
