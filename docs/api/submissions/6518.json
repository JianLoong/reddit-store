His mom has never really been in his life so I truly did the parenting solo. My approach, especially when he got older was that I will give him the freedom to make his own decisions, but, the consequences are his as well. \n\nHe met his now wife when they were both barely 19, 6 months later they were married, he said it was fine, he was in love, she was great. He told her she didn't have to work and, rather than get an apartment, they were living in the renovated basement of one of his childhood friends, paying him rent.  \n\nHe lost his job in November. I will say this, it sounds like it was kind of a shitty situation because the manager who hired him quit a month after hiring him, and it sounds like the new manager was looking to clean house, so, they started with him.\n\nHe immediately calls me, tells me he's fired and wants to come home. I thought at that moment that, this was a massive blow to him, and that I'd be a terrible dad to turn him away. I also figured that he would be super motivated to find another job and get out of my place.\n\nIn the almost 2 months they've lived here, he hasn't looked for a job, nor has she.From what I gather, they sleep until lunch, then just hang out.\n\n When I bring up jobs and rent, he tells me he just needs a little \" breathing room\" or his wife will tell him I need to give him \" time to bounce back\".\n\nYet, when I ask them to do chores, oh, then it's \" I can't do all these chores & job hunt\" and with her it's \" I've never done (insert any chore here). \n\nA couple of nights ago, I told them they were going to start paying rent, whether that means he or she take a job they don't want, I don't care. He argued it would screw up his resume, her response is just \" I don't want to\". I said that they can pay me using their savings.

Your son is acting very entitled and is taking serious advantage of your generosity. Asking him and his wife to pay rent and do chores is the least they can do to help with their upkeep. And seriously, even that is very generous offer; my parents didn\u2019t make me pay rent, but that was because I was going to college/university full time and I was responsible for most of my tuition outside of scholarships/grants/loans. I also still worked almost full time as well!", "Nta. You shouldnt have to support two adults refusing to improve their own situation. Good dad for being a safe fall back when he lost the job, but with neither of them looking for work you are NTA for pushing them to do something more.", "NTA The two of them want an adult life but are expecting the benefits of being cared for like children. Time for them to step up and provide for themselves.", "NTA.", "NTA, and I\u2019m glad this is coming up after two months and not have two years. If they are old enough to be married, they are old enough to provide for themselves.", "He is right it isn't fair...to you.\n\nThey are he and she mooches. They need to pay rent, do house work and be good guests. Otherwise they can start the hunt to  find a fair landlord who will cater to them and not expect payment. Maybe the new landlord can pay them, seems fair.", "OP be firm.  Give them a deadline to get a job and pay some reasonable rent. Or they'll be out. Right now they're just taking advantage of you. NTA", "NTA.  But...\n\nYou just don't start with \"now you have to pay rent.\"  You start with your boundaries.  \"If you are going to live here rent free I expect a, b, c.  If that doesn't happen, pay rent.\"  Give them a timeline, like a day.  \n\nHave you explained that not looking for a job is unacceptable?\n\nIn addition... they are married, I would expect them to be on their feet.  If they are old enough to get married, they are old enough to live on their own.\n\nAnd, as someone with kids similar age (they live at home with clear, specific boundaries that they follow) sometime to love them you have to do the tough thing for them.  They won't realize it's out of love.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to get a job *and* contribute to the household.\n\nHaving a large employment gap is way worse than having a job that you\u2019re \u201cembarrassed\u201d of for whatever reason. It shows you have work ethic and want to be employed, and if you\u2019re transitioning into another field you can tell the hiring manager that you were working at x place until you got the job you really wanted. \n\nAnd if for some reason he\u2019s embarrassed, just don\u2019t put it on your resume.\n\nAnd as for her - she can learn.

A family friend went through something similar and forced his daughter and son-in-law to pay him rent. When they finally moved out, he gave them all the money back plus the interest it had accumulated since he had been putting it in a high-yield savings account.\n\nI'm not saying you should feel obligated to give any of the rent money back, but if you don't charge them rent, they will never grow up and take financial responsibility for themselves.", "NTA - this stuff is literally why people have savings. Not working is one thing but refusing to help out around the house and being unwilling to learn how to contribute is quite another and they are crossing a line with that attitude.\n\nIt would be worth pointing out to your son that having an unexplained gap in his resume will look a lot worse than having taken a \u201cfiller\u201d job - employers like proactivity even if it\u2019s not in a directly related field, and he might even find a new direction by taking a job he doesn\u2019t feel too invested in to begin with.

If this is to help give them the push they need to get back on their feet, maybe you could gift the money back to them at a later time.", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. These individuals are taking advantage of your kindness and their behavior towards you and disrespect of your home is wholly inappropriate. It is normal for kids to push envelopes and see what they can get away with, but they are married adults and I encourage you to continue to create (and enforce!) boundaries with them.", "NTA\n\nSet a timeline for when you expect them to start paying rent, draw up an agreement. ie, it's January, and you expect them to start paying rent in March.  Set a timeline for when you expect them to move out, ie, they will move out by August 2023.  Assign chores in lieu of rent?  Keep it simple and direct, and let them sort out who will look for a job and who will continue to be a lazy ass.  Keep in mind, you might eventually have to evict them, are you ready to do that?  \n\nOne thing to consider, if you can afford it.  Take that rent money you're asking for and save it in a separate account.  Then choose how to give it back to them, either as a car, or as a deposit for that apt they'll have to move into, etc.  (I'm not sure you can trust them with lump sum cash though.)", "NTA and if you don't force this you will be enabling both of them. Tell them bluntly that they will pay you $X per month in rent, each of them will have assigned chores, and they have 6 months to be out of your house. No excuses and no exceptions. ANY failure on their parts to do those things prior to the 6 month deadline will result in them being out on their asses immediately (or 30 days if they force you to evict them). Remind your son that he is an adult and you expect him to act like one.", "I would think him having a gap in his resume would look worse to future employers than having some short term/not glamorous job on there.

I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re asking them to build something crazy as a chore\u2026 but even then, they could probably YouTube it.\n\nAbso-frickin-lutely you are NTA. \n\nMy brother has always been unemployed, even now in his mid 30\u2019s, and my parents made a *huge* mistake in not enforcing that when he was younger and still living with them. I\u2019ve been working since I was 14. The contrast between us is vast. Be firm.", "NTA, he's an adult and so is his wife.  It's one thing if they're trying to get a job and it's a real tight labor market but it's really not.  They need to get off their asses and get going which unless there's some downside unfortunately some will just sit back and enjoy the free ride.", "Absolutely NTA. You did the right thing by taking him in when he was down. Now, he is taking advantage. I personally feel when you get married you have to take on the responsibilities of an adult, regardless if you want to or not. Her saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d is not only disrespectful, it\u2019s concerning. Stand your ground, it\u2019s not fair for you to have to support 2 20 year olds.", "NTA, they\u2019re taking advantage of you.  What resume?  He\u2019s barely 20. Tough love time.", "NTA - you need boundaries, and they need to experience the consequences of their actions.  You gave the, a place to stay because your son freaked when he got fired.  \n\n20-20 hindsight is a wonderful thing\u2026 if instead you had said to your son, son, you are an adult now with a wife, you need to figure this out.  You need to get a job any job to make some income,  there are jobs out there, you might not like it but you have to do what you have to do to earn enough to pay the bills.  son, I need to see your budget.  What is your income and expenses.  If you don\u2019t have one, then since your wife doesn\u2019t have a job, her job is the house work including finances, so have her put together a budget of income and expenses.  You are married now, you have to learn to solve these things on your own with your wife.  And having a stay at home wife is a nice thing if you have the money to afford that luxury, but If you are unemployed and need a place to live, then you were living paycheck to paycheck, and that isn\u2019t sustainable.  What is sustainable is her getting a job to earn some income to build up your savings, until you have 3 months of savings in the bank.  I would also suggest that the income from your wife is what you can use to build up savings for a house, vacations, etc, whi,e your income pays the bills.  This is what adults do.\n\nSo, you didn\u2019t have that conversation before they moved in.  You bailed him out of his mess, so he hasn\u2019t learned the consequences of not having his wife work, which they can\u2019t afford, and it doesn\u2019t sound like she knows how to keep house either.\n\nI would suggest that you tell him, that he is an adult and married,  he and his wife don\u2019t get to lay around and do nothing at your house that you are working to pay for,  they both need to go out and get jobs, any job to start earning income now.  That they have 1 week to get any job, there are lots of jobs in food service. Now is not the time to be picky,  they are unemployed, and they both need to be employed to earn enough to move out.  They are married adults, they chose this.  They need to work and save money to get their own place.  They are no longer kids.  This is what adults do, you get fired, you get another job, any job to pay the bills.\n\nCharging the, rent isnt going to solve the problem, they will just lay around until their savings is gone and then cry that they don\u2019t have any money.  As long as they are under your roof that you are paying for, they need to follow your rules.  If they don\u2019t like it they can move.  The first order of business is for both of them to get jobs, and then show you a budget plan for getting out on their own again.  I would suggest that while they are still In Your house you need to discuss with them career paths and learning marketable skills to get better jobs.  Tradesmen make great money.", "NTA \n\nBut you now have two adult leeches in your house that are egging each other on and enabling each others behaviour at your expense. \n\nYou are in for some trouble my friend!", "NTA. Tough love is what they both need. Give them a timeline, they both need to be working and contributing to the household. His wife needs to work, they are both broke there is no reason why she's at home not working for their own place. Give them 6 months to save and move out, whatever time frame you give them you need to stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nWow dear God, your son is really taking advantage from you.\nOne thing is taking time to recuperate, but two months and not looking for job neither helping with chores? What a lazy mf lol", "NTA. You have a shared list of job opportunities yet? Sounds like he needs structure and a nudge.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your DiL needs to grow tf up. And your son, too. \n\nI'd give them a month and if they weren't both employed with a goal in life they're out the door. If they're not working at all you should be coming home to a sparkling home and dinner waiting for you every day, full stop. They're taking advantage of you, and it sounds like she's taking advantage of him, too.", "NTA - it's well past time for your son and his wife learn to be adults.  Stop enabling them.\n\nAnd next time your daughter in law channels Bartleby the Scrivener, with her \"I don't want to,\" tell her that she can start to contribute or get out.  And while they are looking for jobs, they have to help our with chores. \n\nYou aren't doing your son any favors by coddling him.", "NTA. You did the right thing by letting them stay for awhile. You\u2019re not in the wrong for expecting help with chores or rent two months later.\n\nTo be fair to them though, 20 is still so young. Too young to be married, possibly too young to be easily making it on their own, and many 20 year olds today still haven\u2019t moved out of their parents house or finished their education or learned basic life skills yet. So technically it may not be wrong of you to help them out a bit more. \n\nBut your son made the choice to move out early, and become a working adult and get married super young. So he needs to learn and accept the responsibilities that come with being an adult. And good parenting requires teaching them independence. \n\nBut It\u2019s super messed up that they won\u2019t even help with chores. That\u2019s a red flag. That to me, is completely ungrateful, worrisome behaviour and without knowing them I can\u2019t jump to conclusions but it almost sounds like they have the potential to become lazy ungrateful people who will just continue to take advantage of you. \n\nSo I think you should definitely set firmer boundaries with them. Chores or rent or they\u2019re out of there!", "NTA \nGive them a deadline and if they don\u2019t start paying evict them.
