His mom has never really been in his life so I truly did the parenting solo. My approach, especially when he got older was that I will give him the freedom to make his own decisions, but, the consequences are his as well. \n\nHe met his now wife when they were both barely 19, 6 months later they were married, he said it was fine, he was in love, she was great. He told her she didn't have to work and, rather than get an apartment, they were living in the renovated basement of one of his childhood friends, paying him rent.  \n\nHe lost his job in November. I will say this, it sounds like it was kind of a shitty situation because the manager who hired him quit a month after hiring him, and it sounds like the new manager was looking to clean house, so, they started with him.\n\nHe immediately calls me, tells me he's fired and wants to come home. I thought at that moment that, this was a massive blow to him, and that I'd be a terrible dad to turn him away. I also figured that he would be super motivated to find another job and get out of my place.\n\nIn the almost 2 months they've lived here, he hasn't looked for a job, nor has she.From what I gather, they sleep until lunch, then just hang out.\n\n When I bring up jobs and rent, he tells me he just needs a little \" breathing room\" or his wife will tell him I need to give him \" time to bounce back\".\n\nYet, when I ask them to do chores, oh, then it's \" I can't do all these chores & job hunt\" and with her it's \" I've never done (insert any chore here). \n\nA couple of nights ago, I told them they were going to start paying rent, whether that means he or she take a job they don't want, I don't care. He argued it would screw up his resume, her response is just \" I don't want to\". I said that they can pay me using their savings. They said that wasn't fair.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672884770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103ml3r/aita_for_asking_my_son_his_wife_to_pay_rent/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son is acting very entitled and is taking serious advantage of your generosity. Asking him and his wife to pay rent and do chores is the least they can do to help with their upkeep. And seriously, even that is very generous offer; my parents didn\u2019t make me pay rent, but that was because I was going to college/university full time and I was responsible for most of my tuition outside of scholarships/grants/loans. I also still worked almost full time as well!", "Nta. You shouldnt have to support two adults refusing to improve their own situation.

They need to pay rent, do house work and be good guests. Otherwise they can start the hunt to  find a fair landlord who will cater to them and not expect payment. Maybe the new landlord can pay them, seems fair.", "OP be firm.  Give them a deadline to get a job and pay some reasonable rent. Or they'll be out. Right now they're just taking advantage of you.

If that doesn't happen, pay rent.\"  Give them a timeline, like a day.  \n\nHave you explained that not looking for a job is unacceptable?\n\nIn addition... they are married, I would expect them to be on their feet.  If they are old enough to get married, they are old enough to live on their own.\n\nAnd, as someone with kids similar age (they live at home with clear, specific boundaries that they follow) sometime to love them you have to do the tough thing for them.  They won't realize it's out of love.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to get a job *and* contribute to the household.\n\nHaving a large employment gap is way worse than having a job that you\u2019re \u201cembarrassed\u201d of for whatever reason. It shows you have work ethic and want to be employed, and if you\u2019re transitioning into another field you can tell the hiring manager that you were working at x place until you got the job you really wanted. \n\nAnd if for some reason he\u2019s embarrassed, just don\u2019t put it on your resume.\n\nAnd as for her - she can learn.

When they finally moved out, he gave them all the money back plus the interest it had accumulated since he had been putting it in a high-yield savings account.\n\nI'm not saying you should feel obligated to give any of the rent money back, but if you don't charge them rent, they will never grow up and take financial responsibility for themselves.", "NTA - this stuff is literally why people have savings. Not working is one thing but refusing to help out around the house and being unwilling to learn how to contribute is quite another and they are crossing a line with that attitude.\n\nIt would be worth pointing out to your son that having an unexplained gap in his resume will look a lot worse than having taken a \u201cfiller\u201d job - employers like proactivity even if it\u2019s not in a directly related field, and he might even find a new direction by taking a job he doesn\u2019t feel too invested in to begin with.

If this is to help give them the push they need to get back on their feet, maybe you could gift the money back to them at a later time.", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. These individuals are taking advantage of your kindness and their behavior towards you and disrespect of your home is wholly inappropriate. It is normal for kids to push envelopes and see what they can get away with, but they are married adults and I encourage you to continue to create (and enforce!) boundaries with them.", "NTA\n\nSet a timeline for when you expect them to start paying rent, draw up an agreement. ie, it's January, and you expect them to start paying rent in March.  Set a timeline for when you expect them to move out, ie, they will move out by August 2023.  Assign chores in lieu of rent?  Keep it simple and direct, and let them sort out who will look for a job and who will continue to be a lazy ass.  Keep in mind, you might eventually have to evict them, are you ready to do that?  \n\nOne thing to consider, if you can afford it.  Take that rent money you're asking for and save it in a separate account.  Then choose how to give it back to them, either as a car, or as a deposit for that apt they'll have to move into, etc.  (I'm not sure you can trust them with lump sum cash though.)", "NTA and if you don't force this you will be enabling both of them. Tell them bluntly that they will pay you $X per month in rent, each of them will have assigned chores, and they have 6 months to be out of your house. No excuses and no exceptions. ANY failure on their parts to do those things prior to the 6 month deadline will result in them being out on their asses immediately (or 30 days if they force you to evict them). Remind your son that he is an adult and you expect him to act like one.", "I would think him having a gap in his resume would look worse to future employers than having some short term/not glamorous job on there.

I\u2019ve been working since I was 14. The contrast between us is vast. Be firm.", "NTA, he's an adult and so is his wife.  It's one thing if they're trying to get a job and it's a real tight labor market but it's really not.  They need to get off their asses and get going which unless there's some downside unfortunately some will just sit back and enjoy the free ride.", "Absolutely NTA. You did the right thing by taking him in when he was down. Now, he is taking advantage. I personally feel when you get married you have to take on the responsibilities of an adult, regardless if you want to or not. Her saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d is not only disrespectful, it\u2019s concerning. Stand your ground, it\u2019s not fair for you to have to support 2 20 year olds.", "NTA, they\u2019re taking advantage of you.  What resume?  He\u2019s barely 20. Tough love time.", "NTA - you need boundaries, and they need to experience the consequences of their actions.  You gave the, a place to stay because your son freaked when he got fired.  \n\n20-20 hindsight is a wonderful thing\u2026 if instead you had said to your son, son, you are an adult now with a wife, you need to figure this out.  You need to get a job any job to make some income,  there are jobs out there, you might not like it but you have to do what you have to do to earn enough to pay the bills.  son, I need to see your budget.  What is your income and expenses.  If you don\u2019t have one, then since your wife doesn\u2019t have a job, her job is the house work including finances, so have her put together a budget of income and expenses.  You are married now, you have to learn to solve these things on your own with your wife.  And having a stay at home wife is a nice thing if you have the money to afford that luxury, but If you are unemployed and need a place to live, then you were living paycheck to paycheck, and that isn\u2019t sustainable.  What is sustainable is her getting a job to earn some income to build up your savings, until you have 3 months of savings in the bank.  I would also suggest that the income from your wife is what you can use to build up savings for a house, vacations, etc, whi,e your income pays the bills.  This is what adults do.\n\nSo, you didn\u2019t have that conversation before they moved in.  You bailed him out of his mess, so he hasn\u2019t learned the consequences of not having his wife work, which they can\u2019t afford, and it doesn\u2019t sound like she knows how to keep house either.\n\nI would suggest that you tell him, that he is an adult and married,  he and his wife don\u2019t get to lay around and do nothing at your house that you are working to pay for,  they both need to go out and get jobs, any job to start earning income now.  That they have 1 week to get any job, there are lots of jobs in food service. Now is not the time to be picky,  they are unemployed, and they both need to be employed to earn enough to move out.  They are married adults, they chose this.  They need to work and save money to get their own place.  They are no longer kids.  This is what adults do, you get fired, you get another job, any job to pay the bills.\n\nCharging the, rent isnt going to solve the problem, they will just lay around until their savings is gone and then cry that they don\u2019t have any money.  As long as they are under your roof that you are paying for, they need to follow your rules.  If they don\u2019t like it they can move.  The first order of business is for both of them to get jobs, and then show you a budget plan for getting out on their own again.  I would suggest that while they are still In Your house you need to discuss with them career paths and learning marketable skills to get better jobs.  Tradesmen make great money.", "NTA \n\nBut you now have two adult leeches in your house that are egging each other on and enabling each others behaviour at your expense. \n\nYou are in for some trouble my friend!", "NTA. Tough love is what they both need. Give them a timeline, they both need to be working and contributing to the household. His wife needs to work, they are both broke there is no reason why she's at home not working for their own place. Give them 6 months to save and move out, whatever time frame you give them you need to stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nWow dear God, your son is really taking advantage from you.\nOne thing is taking time to recuperate, but two months and not looking for job neither helping with chores? What a lazy mf lol", "NTA. You have a shared list of job opportunities yet? Sounds like he needs structure and a nudge.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your DiL needs to grow tf up. And your son, too. \n\nI'd give them a month and if they weren't both employed with a goal in life they're out the door. If they're not working at all you should be coming home to a sparkling home and dinner waiting for you every day, full stop. They're taking advantage of you, and it sounds like she's taking advantage of him, too.", "NTA - it's well past time for your son and his wife learn to be adults.  Stop enabling them.\n\nAnd next time your daughter in law channels Bartleby the Scrivener, with her \"I don't want to,\" tell her that she can start to contribute or get out.  And while they are looking for jobs, they have to help our with chores. \n\nYou aren't doing your son any favors by coddling him.", "NTA. You did the right thing by letting them stay for awhile. You\u2019re not in the wrong for expecting help with chores or rent two months later.\n\nTo be fair to them though, 20 is still so young. Too young to be married, possibly too young to be easily making it on their own, and many 20 year olds today still haven\u2019t moved out of their parents house or finished their education or learned basic life skills yet. So technically it may not be wrong of you to help them out a bit more. \n\nBut your son made the choice to move out early, and become a working adult and get married super young. So he needs to learn and accept the responsibilities that come with being an adult. And good parenting requires teaching them independence. \n\nBut It\u2019s super messed up that they won\u2019t even help with chores. That\u2019s a red flag. That to me, is completely ungrateful, worrisome behaviour and without knowing them I can\u2019t jump to conclusions but it almost sounds like they have the potential to become lazy ungrateful people who will just continue to take advantage of you. \n\nSo I think you should definitely set firmer boundaries with them. Chores or rent or they\u2019re out of there!", "NTA \nGive them a deadline and if they don\u2019t start paying evict them.

I\u2019m single, but when I moved back from LA after the entertainment industry tanked during COVID, I had a job within 2 weeks also. I needed to bounce back, and this was me bouncing back. NTA.", "Oh, wow. Honestly, that sounds like an amazing idea.", "I think you made a good comment for OP. I liked what you said.", "Lmao mess up his resume that\u2019s classic", "NTA. sadly it seems like your son has made a stupid decision which is going to cost him. Youve offered to support him as long as he is actively looking for a job and working towards improving his situation. \n\nWould suggest you look at moving them out. Maybe that will open his eyes to the reality of his situation", "NTA.\n\nThey're taking advantage of your kindness. Especially since they're not even helping out around the house.", "Nta. They are leeches", "NTA. They need a reality check. Your son is either naive or stupid or both, to think that at 20 years old they are in a place his wife doesn\u2019t need to work. Especially when there isn\u2019t children+childcare in the picture. Which lets hope that isn\u2019t the next announcement\u2026", "NTA At least the wife is honest. I am cackling over a 19yo thinking that he can screw up his resume. Were you suggesting cat burglary or stripping as occupations?", "NTA pay or leave once kids are married they need to support their family", "NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYou gave him the breathing room. Two months was very kind. \n\nWhen you do charge rent, charge a reasonable amount (not a bare minimum) and then save half of it to give back when he moves out. That will likely be the only way to get him out.", "NTA. You son decided to get married and advise his wife that she didn\u2019t need to work. He lost his job and hasn\u2019t made an effort to get a new one. He needs to face the consequences of his actions. \n\nTough love is what needed here. The longer he is able to mooch around with no job, the harder it will be to get motivated and get one in the future", "NTA for sure. Yikes.", "NTA - but did you ever give your son advice on any decisions he made? If not, that\u2019s shitty parenting.", "How would working be worse for his resume than not?\n\nNTA though I wonder if making their own mistakes has included useful advice or actually letting them go free range. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. But if there's no water it won't drink.", "NTA, and it'll screw up his resume even more the longer he stays unemployed, at least with an \"irrelevant\" job he can show that he did what he had to do to pay the rent, any future employer will respect that. \n\nIf they won't do anything, drop them off at a shelter.", "You have yourself a couple of free loaders here and they will not do anything unless you force their hands so given the complete lack of ambition between the two of them I don\u2019t see how you could possibly be an asshole here.  Old enough to get married, then old enough to get a job!\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nLike some others have said, it's time to lay out the rules.  Give them a date and amount for rent, list out the household expectations, and make them sign the agreement or they have 30/60 days to vacate.\n\nHere's the thing, OP.  That's not being mean or unfair, it's actually a loving decision.  It sounds like your son is caught in a cycle of helplessness and passive resistance.  He got married at 19 and doesn't sound like he has the maturity to handle the role he thought he wanted - provider and husband.  It's easier to move back into your home where they can regress and act like teens and not have all these adult responsibilities being a buzz kill.\n\nBut enabling that is not going to help him in the long run.  He has to be able to handle the decisions that he makes and allowing him to hide in your home isn't going to do that.   So he's going to need a firm nudge that will eventually have to become a hard push if needed.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA- rent and chores sound fair. They are adults now.", "It would be reasonable to expect, in that circumstance, that you could tell her that if she wishes to live as a child in his house, or they both do, then you will be treating her as your own child and giving parental advice and instruction for the duration, and expecting her to learn the required chores and/or get a job along with your son. This could include, for example \u201chomework\u201d sessions each evening to ensure they complete a quota of job applications (no matter what for) under supervision.\n\nIf they wish to live there as adults then they can make the required changes themselves with less supervision, and you could offer them a discount on the rent for helping with the chores, but the expectations you set for them should apply to both of them equally and should be non-negotiable.\n\nApart from anything else, they are still quite early in their life together and the lifestyle they have fallen into is one that leaves them open to boredom, low self-esteem and depression in the longer term - but they don\u2019t know that yet because they haven\u2019t the experience to reach that stage, so it\u2019s going to be beneficial to all of you if you help them to avoid the worst consequences of their own apathy.", "I'd still expect rent (and the other stuff), but save and let them use it a start up fund when they move out.", "NTA. And having seen a sibling behave similar I'd be wary of believing his version of being fired unless you know the manager who did it personally. Given his laziness it could be he and said manager were cut from the same cloth and fired for that reason. \n\nMy sibling certainly gave a good story but reality is somewhat different.", "Nta. Buy them a tent and tell them as married adults it\u2019s time to go build their own life. It seems drastic but this level of entitlement is also absurd.", "NTA - They are adults and need to provide for them selves.", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like they both want to stay children and be taken care of. They need to pay rent including utilities. Life is real", "NTA. Make it clear they have 30 days to either provide rent money or pack up their things \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAlso, of his wife refuses to do any housework and has never done basic chores before, why is your son fine with her being sah??? What does she bring to the table other than entitlement???", "NTA, Are you feeding them? Stop doing that.", "NTA. His wife is lazy AF and his is taking full advantage your hospitality.", "NTA most people don\u2019t have the luxury to just not work for months on end with no true employment prospects in sight. Welcome to the real world, son and DIL. It\u2019s also dangerously optimistic for a couple to agree to one of them simply not working and sitting on their ass all day unless they\u2019re a trust fund baby \u2014 breadwinners die, lose their jobs, or become ill all the time. They should\u2019ve learned this as it just happened to them.\n\nTime for tough love.", "I think you're NTA.\n\nAnd I'm super-stuck on how a 20YO person have never done a single chore ever.", "Nta. They either pay rent or this is their 30 day notice. End of discussion. No one gets to live somewhere for free.", "NTA. Welcome to reality and being an adult! They need to either work, or help out around the house. The next time she says she doesn\u2019t know how or she\u2019s never blank before, tell her she\u2019s gonna learn today! Grown enough to get married then grown enough to take on the responsibilities of having a family. Don\u2019t feel bad for making them pay rent. Sit them down and tell them things are going to be this way and if you don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s the door. Harsh but life isn\u2019t easy on anyone.", "NTA \n\nYour son and his wife are acting worse than children. If they are old enough to be married, then they're old enough to get jobs and pay rent.", "Yeah it\u2019s crazy she is sah when she apparently has zero idea how to do housework \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f What does she bring to the table??? Because it sounds like she is just a parasite", "According to my son, she brings, \" being hot\", \" fun\", and \" spontaneous\"", "Doesn't sound like he knows what spontaneous means", "That's his answer?!  Your unemployed son has a trophy wife? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI'd make sure to explain to the two of them that until they can buy a house of their own, (good luck with that,) they are going to have to live in shared housing, IOW, with roommates. No roommates are going to be happy living with two people that don't pay rent and utilities or help keep things clean. Explain to them that you're actually doing them a favor by teaching them how adults manage to live together happily. \n\nNTA.", "So in other words, she brings absolutely nothing to the table \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f All I can say is yikes, at least these two garbage people found each other instead of ruining someone\u2019s life that is actually a productive member of society \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I would make them both get jobs. Either both jobs out of the house, or one out of the house and one as a home maker - clean, cook and do laundry. There is a lot that can be done in 8 hours a day", "\u201cYour unemployed son has a trophy wife?\u201d\n\nLmaooooo"]}
