I know that we shouldn't talk about personal stuff with coworkers but everyone are doing it. \n\nThen one weekend the topic of relationship comes up. The sous chef, who is my supervisor, talked about how he went down on his gf and she didn't let him continue and vented about it to us (we're all guys, ranging from 20s to 30s).    \nThen he asked about each of our relationship.    \nIt was Dee's turn.
