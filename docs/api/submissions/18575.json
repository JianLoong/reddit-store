He passed away suddenly two months ago.\n\n  \nMy grandparents started a watchmaking company over 50 years ago, they ran it for over 40, and retired a decade ago, my uncle took over.\n\n  \nWhen I went to live with my uncle he just started working for the company full time after graduating college, insted of having a babysitter he would take me to work if I was not in school.\n\n  \nUncle met Melissa when I was 10, she was very nice to me, they got married when I was 12, and had their first child a few months later, when my cousin Mark(20) was born things changed, she stopped packing my lunch and other stuff, I know that she is not my mom but before she would just look at me with a smile and after she would barely acknowledge my existence. They had two more sons.\n\nAnyways, I worked there part time as a teen helping around, and uncle taught me a few things.\n\nUncle took over the company in 2012, my grandparents gave it to him, he took it from 145 emploeeys to almost 1000 in 10 years, even started a watchmaking school, I went to college then uncle hired me full time as a desingner.\n\n  \nTime went on, Mark would work for like 4 hours a week and get a full week's pay, and I've heard all my cousins and my aunt talk about how watchmaking is stupid, and that It's too much for something that only tells you the time(this comment is particularly ignorant, as we don't make only watches anymore and I thought Mark paid just enough attention to know that, but it seems I was wrong), so it never seem like they were intrested in the company.\n\n  \nBack to now, after my uncle's funeral, my aunt informed me that they were selling the company, as is useless to them, but they were willing to let me make an offer first, I was heartbroken, I just lost my uncle and was probably going to lose my job because there was no way I could get the money.\n\n  \nLast week my uncle's will was read, all the money was divided in equal parts among me, my cousins and mu aunt, she got his part of the house, and I got the company, 100% of the company, they were furious.\n\n  \nI now have some friends saying it's their right to be upset for not getting something they understood were getting, extended family calling me a thief because it was their father's company, and my cousins texting me things like \"just give it to us\", \"we're contesting the will\", \"metting our lawyer tomorrow\" or \"we're going to destroy you for what you're doing\", my grandparents are on my side but I just feel like I'm being harassed by all this people.\n\nEdit: I can't fire Mark right now, if I do it would be a huge risk, he has \"flexible hours\" writen on his contract and he's salaried, and with all this drama...\n\nI am getting lawyers to deal with this, and I don't actually talk to my aunt and two oldest cousins(the youngest is 11), I just open their messages to take screenshot.", "created_utc": 1685476581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0boq/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritence_with_my/", "score": 3811, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In the USA, the surviving spouse has all the control over property in like 99 percent of cases. If there is a beneficiary other than spouse, it is divided 50/50. In some states, this may require filing for an \"elective share.\" I'm sorry if I'm wrong, OP, but I'm going to say YTA for lying. If a business owner with 1000+ employees dies, it makes the news.

Cousins were brandishing rifles and threatening him with death.  Boyfriend graciously packed up and ran off to live in Brooklyn.

They want to contest the will? Let them--you file a counterclaim and lambaste their claims as frivolous, the result of unfulfilled avarice, and beneath the court's need to render a decision on.\n\nThat said, these people don't sound like they've actually talked to an attorney and they might very well not have a leg to stand on and just be trying to buffalo you into agreeing to do something you don't have to.\n\nFor example: Did you uncle formally adopt you? If he did, you're just as much a statutory inheritor as all of his other children. And how long before your uncle died was the will made? If it's more than a few months before he died it's going to be exceedingly difficult to prove your uncle was defrauded into changing his will, or taken advantage of because of dementia.... And there aren't a ton of other reasons to overturn a will besides those or if it unfairly disinherits statutory inheritors. But it doesn't sound like his will does that--it sounds like the business was important to him and he wanted you to have it because it was important to you, too.\n\nMost of all, keep your correspondence with them to a minimum, preferably to none, and have your attorney do all the talking. They're sloppy--keep screenshots of everything they send you and just don't respond to them. Again: This is why you've got an attorney.\n\nGood luck--inheritance fights can get nasty, especially if your uncle's family are already calling you a \"thief.\" Honestly, I'd block the lot of them and only communicate through lawyers from here forward--that's not a series of relationships worth saving.", "NTA.

They weren\u2019t disinherited, had they been then they\u2019d have a case. They received an equal parts of his personal assets so they can\u2019t do anything**. Not to mention your uncle wasn\u2019t mentally incapacitated he wasn\u2019t old, he wasn\u2019t mentally ill, etc. They can try to blow all the money they want but they\u2019re not going to win, nor should they. **You seem to have been under the impression that he was blind to their passive aggressive comments about the company, he clearly wasn\u2019t. Even if that had absolutely nothing to do with it he clearly wanted it to go to YOU**.\n\n **He knew you\u2019d be the only one to carry on the legacy, instead of selling it. It doesn\u2019t matter what everyone else wants or what they think you should do. It only matters that it\u2019s what your uncle personally wanted, going against his wishes would be a disrespect to him**. So would you rather disrespect your deceased uncle or annoy the rest of them? I know I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I went against his wishes. **Not to mention he likely knew with your mom dying with you so young, that you\u2019d likely never get another inheritance and this was meant to set you up for life. More so because his sister died before she would\u2019ve been able to Inherit her half of the company that later would have gone to you.**\n\n**You were always meant to half atleast half or the company at the end or the day. I\u2019m guessing he gave it to you entirely because if you shared it 50/50 with your cousins they could force you into selling** and he didn\u2019t want that. Not to mention with him being your mothers twin he likely felt more like a father to you. Twins have a way deeper connection than most siblings do, and with him literally losing his other half in life he must have felt like you were all he had left of her. **Don\u2019t diminish the bond you had or let others diminish it simply because they don\u2019t like it or because they\u2019re pissed they\u2019re not getting the big payday they wanted**. I also need to say their assumptions are not your responsibility.\n\nThat they all just assumed without actually talking to him or not knowing his general plan was stupid. Especially considering **if he and your \u201caunt\u201d were married and he was able to gift the company to you 100% they likely had a pre/or postnuptial agreement. With that said it\u2019s even dumber for them to just assume they should all get it 100% or even 50%. Just because they thought it should\u2019ve been theirs is not a good enough reason** to give it to them. It\u2019s not what your uncle wanted period, we\u2019re talking about his estate here so his and only his wishes matter. If you feel the need to give his kids something, I wouldn\u2019t it\u2019s not what he wanted.\n\n**IF you do DO NOT give them more than 30% ownership. Split that 30% between all of his kids, none to his wife that way they can still get some monthly profit from it without having the power to push you to sell, or taking control of the company. This is still really risky though and if you want to help them the smarter way would be to just gift them a tiny bit of your profits monthly instead of giving them any ownership. What they want is money not the company, you also run the risk if you give them 30% collectively that they sell their 30% to some large asshole investor that'll give you some major problems down the line**. \n\n**P.S. Go hire an attorney like yesterday, and not anyone that someone in your family directs you to. Do your research find the best, and use them.
