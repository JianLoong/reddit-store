They had two more sons.\n\nAnyways, I worked there part time as a teen helping around, and uncle taught me a few things.\n\nUncle took over the company in 2012, my grandparents gave it to him, he took it from 145 emploeeys to almost 1000 in 10 years, even started a watchmaking school, I went to college then uncle hired me full time as a desingner.\n\n  \nTime went on, Mark would work for like 4 hours a week and get a full week's pay, and I've heard all my cousins and my aunt talk about how watchmaking is stupid, and that It's too much for something that only tells you the time, so it never seem like they were intrested in the company.\n\n  \nBack to now, after my uncle's funeral, my aunt informed me that they were selling the company, as is useless to them, but they were willing to let me make an offer first, I was heartbroken, I just lost my uncle and was probably going to lose my job because there was no way I could get the money.\n\n  \nLast week my uncle's will was read, all the money was divided in equal parts among me, my cousins and mu aunt, she got his part of the house, and I got the company, 100% of the company, they were furious.\n\n  \nI now have some friends saying it's their right to be upset for not getting something they understood were getting, extended family calling me a thief because it was their father's company, and my cousins texting me things like \"just give it to us\", \"we're contesting the will\", \"metting our lawyer tomorrow\" or \"we're going to destroy you for what you're doing\", my grandparents are on my side but I just feel like I'm being harassed by all this people.", "created_utc": 1685476581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0boq/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritence_with_my/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your uncle did what he wanted, with no remorse. You straighten up and do the same.", "NTA clearly your uncle heard everyone's opinion of the \"stupid\" watch company, and set down his will with that in mind.

Your Uncle raised you in the company, probably knew that they would sell it...so he gave it to you.  You keep it.  They got the house and money.

Either way, I am sorry for your loss and wish you all the luck for the future.", "NTA, \n\njust lawyer up as well. Family as you know it, will no longer be as it is. Make sure you get the buy-in from Gramps, he\u2019s the founder so surely his support probably means something. \n\nIf you want a more peaceful life, you probably need to continue some of your uncle\u2019s legacies, like continue to pay the full wage for the leech Mark as your uncle had done.

Such a nasty surprise for them...\n\nIt is a family business. Your uncle, your mum's twin, your legal guardian and surogate father since you were four, wasn't stupid.

They do have a right to be angry but they have no right to take it out on you.", "NTA.

That company is rightfully yours - your grandma and grandpa, the founders and ORIGINAL owners - are on your side because they know how much you deserve it. \n\nYour aunt & cousins only care about money and not the family business, which is so damn sad.

I agree with your uncle\u2019s decision to give you the company, as you are obviously the one that wanted to keep it up and running. Maybe to save yourself from probate though, offer them a certain percentage of the proceeds from the company quarterly. Hope you guys work it out", "NTA. Don't give them the company, your uncle left it to you for a reason! Hire a lawyer if you need to, and block their numbers for right now. You don't need the harassment.\n\nI'm sorry for your losses.", "NTA. There's no questions to be had here. It was his company to do with what he wished, and what he wished to do with it was leave it to you. And it sounds like for good reason, seems like you're the only one that would see it as something more than an asset to be sold off for cash.\n\nHaving said that if they're contesting the will hire a lawyer. Do not talk to or take advice from your aunt's lawyer, do not talk to or take advice from the estate lawyer, hire your *own* lawyer and only talk to and take advice from *them.* And do not sign *anything* unless *your* lawyer has read it and advised you on it.", "NTA. \n\nCompany is yours, full stop, uncle left it to you.

He's essentially your father. You care about the watch making business, and they don't. It makes sense he gave it to you, and, most importantly, it actually was his right to make that decisions. \n\nYour cousin and your aunt are assholes, and completely unjustified. If they actually cared about your uncle's wishes they'd let it be, but clearly they only care about the money. They can contest the will all they want, but that doesn't mean anything will come of it. Them being his blood children or his wife doesn't give them automatic right to his possessions when the will says otherwise, and to successfully contest a will you need actual justification, such as if he left something to a stranger, or wasn't of sound mind at end of life and was coerced or tricked in to it.
