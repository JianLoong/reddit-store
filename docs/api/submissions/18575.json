They had two more sons.\n\nAnyways, I worked there part time as a teen helping around, and uncle taught me a few things.\n\nUncle took over the company in 2012, my grandparents gave it to him, he took it from 145 emploeeys to almost 1000 in 10 years, even started a watchmaking school, I went to college then uncle hired me full time as a desingner.\n\n  \nTime went on, Mark would work for like 4 hours a week and get a full week's pay, and I've heard all my cousins and my aunt talk about how watchmaking is stupid, and that It's too much for something that only tells you the time(this comment is particularly ignorant, as we don't make only watches anymore and I thought Mark paid just enough attention to know that, but it seems I was wrong), so it never seem like they were intrested in the company.\n\n  \nBack to now, after my uncle's funeral, my aunt informed me that they were selling the company, as is useless to them, but they were willing to let me make an offer first, I was heartbroken, I just lost my uncle and was probably going to lose my job because there was no way I could get the money.\n\n  \nLast week my uncle's will was read, all the money was divided in equal parts among me, my cousins and mu aunt, she got his part of the house, and I got the company, 100% of the company, they were furious.\n\n  \nI now have some friends saying it's their right to be upset for not getting something they understood were getting, extended family calling me a thief because it was their father's company, and my cousins texting me things like \"just give it to us\", \"we're contesting the will\", \"metting our lawyer tomorrow\" or \"we're going to destroy you for what you're doing\", my grandparents are on my side but I just feel like I'm being harassed by all this people.\n\nEdit: I can't fire Mark right now, if I do it would be a huge risk, he has \"flexible hours\" writen on his contract and he's salaried, and with all this drama...\n\nI am getting a lawyer to deal with this, and I don't actually talk to my aunt and two oldest cousins(the youngest is 11), I just open their messages to take screenshot.", "created_utc": 1685476581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0boq/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritence_with_my/", "score": 1375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A company of 1000+ employees is going to have some shareholder interest and a plan in place for interest in the event of a death. In the USA, the surviving spouse has all the control over property in like 99 percent of cases. If there is a beneficiary other than spouse, it is divided 50/50. In some states, this may require filing for an \"elective share.\" I'm sorry if I'm wrong, OP, but I'm going to say YTA for lying. If a business owner with 1000+ employees dies, it makes the news.
