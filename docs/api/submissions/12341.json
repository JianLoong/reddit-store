Please don\u2019t crucify me\u2026\n\nESH.\n\nIt kind of sounds like you have created a situation where you cannot be pleased, and your husband cannot win. And you both seem really bitter about it and blame each other for it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to consider a compromise. Can you move closer while remaining in low contact with the members of the family that you don\u2019t want to be around? So he can be home more? I know not all the details have been shared about this initial break up, but this sounds like it\u2019s being made more complicated than it needs to be\n\nOkay, now onto the actual conflict at hand. I think it\u2019s preposterous that he is blaming you over a very simple misunderstanding that a toddler made. At the same time though you don\u2019t seem to be very supportive about the situation either, or really acknowledge that he is hurt, and trying his best to prove to her that he actually does live there while also working hard and traveling to provide for the family. \n\nI think a good, long talk about these lingering issues would be a good idea and maybe try to understand each other better and see what kind of solutions or compromises are available rather than battle it out. Best of luck!", "Info: What have you said to your daughter, when the topic comes up?\n\nHow feasible is it for your husband to cut his hours/travel?

If so why? Is there a way to move closer to his workplace so travel can be cut down?\n\nRelationships are a give and take thing. If moving closer to his HQ will allow him more time with his family I'd say that's a worthy thing to pursue.", "INFO\n\nespecially the last part about you and the HQ. What if you wanted to live where you did and now he has a 2 hour daily commute, and he needs to do it to support the family? Not saying this is the case. \n\nthings to consider. Is he the primary breadwinner and is the income needed to support the family? Is he happy with his job, and could he easily get just as good of a job where he works less, makes as much, and is happy? This may be possible but isnt easy. Not saying he is the breadwinner but assuming this is the best he can do and he is doing it to support the family then he is doing the right thing, right? And if he is working/commuting more to support things you want, like living further from where he works, that is more sacrafice on his part. \n\nThings to consider, that ran through my head. As noted none of this may be the case, you could easily be making far more, and working closer to your job.", "INFO: Are you working and if not why don't you move somewhere more convenient for him?", "Info: Why are you the reason you don't live closer to his work? If his job requires him to be at HQ a lot then you either need to find a way to move closer or he needs to find another job. But you've left a lot of details out here so it's hard to make a call. Do you work too? Would it be fairly easy for your husband to get a job closer to home? Is he just traveling to HQ or is he traveling elsewhere (i.e. it doesn't matter where you live because he'll have to travel no matter what)? When your daughter insisted he lived elsewhere, what did you tell her?\n\nI understand your frustration with him being away a lot so it sounds like you let your daughter's comment stand uncorrected as a means to drive your point home and punish him.", "From the info you've given it sounds like his being away so often is a necessity and in that case you should absolutely do more to reassure your daughter. YTA.", "YTA. I'm sorry, but this is on you. I grew up with my dad being a long haul truck driver. I would see him for about three days every 2-3 weeks. I ALWAYS knew he lived with me and my mom and counted down the days until I could see him again. My mom would say things like \"daddy will be home in two days,\" or \"we are going to go on a trip when dad gets home\" when he was gone. She always emphasized we were his home.", "In the moment, you say \"no honey, that's dad, he lives here but he works hard for our family and he has to sleep in hotels for work sometimes.\". Once your daughter is in bed, then you have the adult conversation with your spouse. \n\nI dunno if YTA fits here, but probably. It seems to me that you don't want to correct her because it gives you a point in the fight with your hubby. That's pretty rude to your spouse, and also not fair to your daughter, don't involve her in this.", "With the facts as they are presented, YTA. He works away a lot, I can relate to that. Why is it because of you that he has to travel so much? What have you done / said to reassure the children that he's their parent and does want to be a part of their life? Why was there a fight about his travel? On the flip side, how did he manage to be home more as a consequence of the argument if this was unachievable before it happened? Too many questions to answer here really...", "From what I\u2019ve just read YTA. He\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing to support the family, YOUR family. Do you actually think he likes being away from his family like he is? It sounds to me like you resent him and are not putting the effort into your daughter and explaining that Daddy is away at work and will be home, how else would she think he doesn\u2019t line there? On the other hand maybe he just wants to be away from you", "YTA for piling on. Why don't you move closer so you can be with your husband more and he can be with his kids? If he is the primary earner and paying the bills why wouldn't you want to move and support your husband.", "YTA.\n\nHave you ever tried, I dunno, correcting your daughter when she says that?", "YTA you resent that he is not home more often and therefore are most likely not doing anything to help your daughter understand that her dad lives with you. I think you are using it as a sort of punishment. Like would the sentence \"daddy is coming home soon\" not ever come up? I feel like you didn't correct the daughter at all when she thought that. Comfort your husband instead. Why are you punishing him for working far away when you chose to move away?", "YTA. Based on the info provided it sounds like you are letting your bitterness that he\u2019s gone so much get in the way of making this easier for your kids.", "YTA because you are a parent here as well. It is *equally* your job to educate your child. If she cannot believe her dad, then *you* have a responsibility to teach her.\n\nAnd no, she absolutely is *not* too young. My child had to learn a similar lesson at the age of 2. It's easy to explain things if you actually try.\n\nUntold numbers of families live in similar situations. Their children typically still know their parents live in the home.\n\nYou're being deliberately obtuse to punish your husband for his time away, and it's going to end up harming your child.\n\nYou should try communicating with the other adult, like an adult, rather than weaponizing your child.", "YTA if it's your fault that y'all don't live closer to his work. Also, I hope you corrected your daughter. If not, that makes you at even bigger A.", "Info: Did he take the job knowing he had to travel? Why does he blame you for not living in the same city? How would it be your fault that your toddler doesn\u2019t think her father lives there? Are you saying anything negative around your 3 year old about him working far away? \n\nWithout any more information I\u2019m going to go with NTA.  \n\nLots of people are in relationships where one of them has to relocate for work or be gone for work. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault really a lot of times because sometimes it\u2019s the only job you can get. Or the only one that will pay you enough. \n\nMy family did this for about 2 years and it was hard but we made it work. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of way your husband could communicate with his children while he\u2019s gone. He could do FaceTime bedtime stories. He could come home for weekends or more often if that\u2019s an option. Maybe you and your children could visit that city on the weekend.\n\nWhat he shouldn\u2019t be doing is getting angry at what a toddler thinks and blaming it on you. Toddlers think and say all kinds of stuff.", "YTA if he\u2019s just doing his job. If he\u2019s picking up extra shifts, going out after work, etc that\u2019s a different story.", "ESH - you should move closer to the company or part way there? Is he a flight away? A long drive? This is headed to divorce if you don\u2019t move or he doesn\u2019t switch jobs or go partly remote. Also your kids won\u2019t know their dad - he will be like a visiting Grandparent. Sounds like he has some control and can do more to be at home which he should be doing.", "YTA, thats a pretty mean thing to say to a significant other when they're feeling down. Doubly so if he actually did move away from his job for you", "YTA. Sounds like he is doing everything he can to be around his family while providing financial support, and you are acting like he is an asshole for it. If you absolutely can't get yourself to move closer to where he works, you could at least be supportive of him and try to help your daughter understand that he loves you and her and his home is where his family is.", "NTA and it makes me laugh and cry at the same time. Its funny coming from a 3 year old on when her daddy is going home as he's married to his work and sad on how little she gets to see him and on all he's missing out on. Pretty soon she will be grow up and will have friends and get on with her life. Either way he needs to be at home more if he wants to change the perception with his daughter and nothing you do is going to work. Next time he brings it up, ask him if he wants you to get a blow up doll to replace him or how you are supposed to tell the little girl daddy lives at home when he's never at home. Hope the little angel is keeping well and is getting plenty of time from mommy.", "ESH. Your husband should prioritise spending more time with your kids, especially during their formative years. However, you should be trying to make your kids understand that their dad isn\u2019t somebody who \u2018just visits\u2019 and is, in fact, a permanent and important part of their lives. After all, i\u2019m assuming he\u2019s working with the goal of supporting the family. In my limited opinion based off the info provided, you two need to converse and get your priorities straight. Talk through the issues and try to fix them, or at least come to a compromise where both of you and the kids will be happier.", "NTA for not trying to convince the 3 year old that he lives there but this is with the assumption that you actually did correct her.  However, you are the asshole for using your 3 year olds confusion to make your husband feel bad about something that he already feels bad about.  \n\nIt sounds like you want your way and only your way without compromise.  This may or may not be the truth - I only see what you wrote here but ponder it because I don't see this marriage going far without you two coming together on this matter (and that doesn't mean him doing all of the work to suit you).", "NAH, 3 year olds just think different. My wife worked evenings getting home a bit after our daughter was in bed, and my daughter was convinced she didn't sleep because she thought she worked all night. She also thought a \"sister\" was just a good friend and you could ask someone to be your sister and they'd move in to your house. She tried to adopt a lot of kids at playgrounds. \n\nI'm not sure there's much you can do to convince your daughter he doesn't have another house. Maybe try to show her picture so of hotels and explain them. In a year she'll figure out how things work anyway.  Probably in her mind if you sleep somewhere it's your home, and if he's not sleeping there he must have a different home.", "NTA\n\nThe 3 year old is just noticing the situation and asking questions. Could you have helped with it, yes but why? When he is not there that is when you should talk to her and tell her he is working and needs to travel for work a lot. I can understand his side, but she is too young to really understand the situation. \n\nFurther , you are in a partnership. If his work HQ is elsewhere and your job keeps you here then that is the situation. If you created the situation I can understand his side, but if this was already in place prior then that is the situation. If he does not like it, then you 2 need to sit and talk about it and see which one is going to make a compromise and start looking for work close to home or close to HQ so you can move. Its a compromise so I do not think, based on what is here, that he should be upset with you because your work he in city A and his is in City B", "YTA based on what's presented here. \n\nBut I'm also sensing there's a lot you left out that would NOT help your case.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like he is working long hours and stuff to provide for the family. \n\nYeah, the kid has things wrong, and it sucks.  But your reaction is pretty shitty.  It sounds like you are using your childs words, and how hurt he was, to advance your own position of him cutting back on hours.", "NTA, and I say that as someone empathetic to your husband's situation.\n\nIf you had said this, or encouraged your daughter to say it, my answer would flip instantly, but it seems to just be a natural child's question. It hurts your husband because it's really how your daughter feels, but that isn't your fault and I don't see where you could have \"done more\". As long as you explain the how and why to your daughter consistently, you're doing your part.\n\nI hope your family's situation can change soon - this is obviously hurting your husband and having a negative effect on your daughter's perception of him. You and your husband need to have a good conversation about how to improve things if you want your marriage to last.\n\n/source: been the dad in this situation, it really, really sucked the life out of me", "NTA", "NTA, he feels like he\u2019s failing as a dad and projecting that on you. i remember having this exact same thing happen to my younger sister after my dad switched jobs while we were kids\u2014he was wildly upset when she wasn\u2019t reactive/excited after he got back from a specific trip, and it\u2019s like, what do you expect? they\u2019re young kids. they don\u2019t understand (nor should they have to) how the world works and tell themselves stories to uncomplicate it.\n\nhe wouldn\u2019t react so strongly to such a simple & understandable comment on her part if he didn\u2019t feel it were somewhat true, at least in spirit. maybe discuss intentional family time together or setting aside a routine \u201cfamily day\u201d when you\u2019re both away from work. this is an opportunity to connect as parents and spouses", "YTA.

It's tough on him, and he often acts out because he misses me. A quick phone call from me, more often than not, will change that. Idk what kind of work your husband does, but a quick phone call during breaks or lunch really isn't that hard to do. I'm able to call while working, even if it's for a few quick seconds to say hi and let my family know I love them and I'm thinking about them. If his kiddo is saying stuff like this, he needs to put in a little more effort to talk to his kids if he can, and let them know that he is gone so he can take care of them. You ALSO need to be assuring your children of this as well. I guarantee you, if he could find a job where he made the same exact money and could be home, he'd do it in a heartbeat. I know I would.\n\nTLDR: ESH, both of yall need to do better at reassuring your children, he needs to make more time to speak to the kids, and you need to be more supportive of your husband as well as take more time to reassure the kids about why he's gone so much.", "Considering you're also the reason he's working so distant from home, YTA \nYou should help your daughter understand the situation instead of being only a bystander.

OP blames her refusal to move back on his family, but living in the same as someone does not automatically mean having to interact with them. if she refuses to make the sacrifice of moving closer so that her daughter can have both parents in her life & still isn\u2019t making any effort to explain these things in a way her daughter understands, she\u2019s TA. if his job is paying the bills & he can\u2019t be home, she has a certain responsibility to explain to this kid that her dad DOES love her and miss her. sounds to me like she hasn\u2019t done a thing to even try to explain why he\u2019s gone so much. \n\nYTA", "Thats true. What I find issue with is that, while he made those decisions,  he has clearly made that sacrifice for their relationship. And it doesn't really seem like he had any issue with it, as he they have been living like this for a while. OP states that they got back together before they had the kids, so for at least 3 years, he's been commuting to the old city, while living with her. He's been \\*voluntarily\\* making these choices for the sake of their relationship. The *bare minimum* that she could do would be to not kick him when he's down then.\n\nLike, she essentially said \"Gee honey, I know you aren't home often because of all you do for *me* and *our* children. But that's *your* fault, what did you expect?\". Maybe your view is different, but I think that's disrespectful as hell, and I'd be upset too.", "This isn't important at all.\n\nThey have a child now. That's all that matters. You don't get to act like a stupid angry teenager when you're a parent. I know a sub filled with stupid angry teenagers isn't the place for me to say this, but that's the truth. The child is important. She is intentionally keeping the child and the child's father separated.\n\nShe is an asshole.

Thus we should assume her portrayal of her inlaws and their actions to be nowhere near accurate.  And since liars tend to have other negative traits we and safely assume that there's much more to her inlaws' dislike of her than her \"woe is me and my poor innocent self\" story is telling us.", "How? You just assumed she moved to another city jobless? What\u2019s \u201creaching\u201d about it?", "Where did you come to the conclusion that she\u2019s encouraging it? You just made that up", "So she should uproot her life for their daughter (more for him), but he can\u2019t uproot his life for them? If we\u2019re just making things up now,, \u201csounds to me\u201d like she\u2019s already uprooted herself twice for him (moving to another city bc of his toxic family, giving up her job to take care of their daughter bc he obviously can\u2019t be any help with his job). Maybe it\u2019s time for him to start making some sacrifices if he wants to bond with his daughter", "I mean or he could just get a new job closer to his family where he sees them every day? Why are we negating that like it isn't a perfectly normal option. That's what most everybody does when they move. It seems like he's already got one foot out the door at this point and maybe he kept the job so he'd still have a link to his family which, again, back to the boundaries thing.", "lol. sure, pickme. as long as op stays in the kitchen and does as she's told everything will be fine.\n\nThe only ah move on OP's part was not staying broken up before kids came along. Husband decided work and his ancestry mattered more than his family that he supposedly chose.", "This is a thing that drives me nuts with AITA. I disagree with someone and then 4 comments later they say something like \"I'm not talking about the OP, I'm just talking in general\" and I'm like \"then why are you even on this thread opening your mouth?!\"", "No but maybe the could look for another job if they\u2019re unable to actually be a parent that is present in their kids life?\n\nI could be biased though, I had a dad that chose to keep working a job that meant he was never here. I went no contact with him around 10 years ago now. OP\u2019s husband could and should do more to be there.", "Pssst, he's old enough that when he quit jobs in his 20s, he could find another one the same day. He's just a little out of touch.", "Let me just spend all my time refreshing the user page of the OP of a 5 hour old post for if she inevitably decides to share any pertinent information. Sounds like a totally normal use of time.", "She said her husband couldn\u2019t convince their daughter that he does live with them. She at no point makes any mention of having tried to reinforce that dad does, in fact, live there. And then she blames him for being upset about it.", "He could, but there are so many reasons to not leave a job. We don't know what he does/ what his field is. Maybe there just aren't that many jobs in his industry in the new city. Or maybe all of the available positions in the current city are not union jobs, but his current position is. Maybe he's in a more senior position in his current role, and if he moves to another job, he will have to essentially take a demotion. \n\nA lot of people don't take new jobs when they move, nor do they just leave because its more convenient. Ill use my family as an example, my mom worked in DC for like 8 years, and we live in Central MD. She was driving to work everyday, and would sometimes have a two hour trip both ways with traffic. She did that because the pay and the benefits were good, she had a senior position at her job and my parents were saving up to send me to college. Could she have just \"found another job\", theoretically yes. But there were clearly others reasons for not doing so. She has provided no info as to why her husband has to work out there, so I won't blame him for it, unless the reason is simply \"I don't want to leave my co-workers\" or something stupid like that.", ">as long as op stays in the kitchen and does as she's told everything will be fine.\n\nWho said anything about...\n\nWhat the fuck are you even talking about?\n\nWhat were you smoking when you wrote this?\n\nThe OP is the abuser in this relationship.

Moving is hard, changing jobs is hard, setting up appointments for FaceTimes is easier but work may end up getting in the way, etc.\n\nComing up with a few fun, goofy ways to reassure the daughter that her father is just busy with work and providing for the family seems as easy as it gets IMO.", "Or maybe OP could get over her own hang ups and move back to the city that he works in", "Yeah more productive just to tell everyone who did see it that they can\u2019t read", "But if we don't know the reasons then we can't blame the wife either, there's not enough information for us to pass judgement. I would imagine it would be a very frustrating scenario if in the 3 years my husband refused to look for other work simply because he got complacent at his company. Also when you have kids a demotion isn't really as bad as missing out on your child's life to the point that they only see you as a visitor in their home. That's not on the mom, that's on him. She can't prevent a 3 year old from not missing her dad when he's gone weeks at a time. You said he's sacrificing for his family by working away from home but wouldn't the real sacrifice be reducing travel time or taking another job to stay home with his kids? You can't get that time back.", "> The OP is the abuser in this relationship. Fact.\n\nYeah I'm done entertaining the delusions of some 15 year old edgelord."]}
