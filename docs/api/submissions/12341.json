You mention being angry with his travel and long hours but near the end admit that you are the reason you two don\u2019t live closer to the HQ.

Please don\u2019t crucify me\u2026\n\nESH.\n\nIt kind of sounds like you have created a situation where you cannot be pleased, and your husband cannot win. And you both seem really bitter about it and blame each other for it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to consider a compromise. Can you move closer while remaining in low contact with the members of the family that you don\u2019t want to be around? So he can be home more? I know not all the details have been shared about this initial break up, but this sounds like it\u2019s being made more complicated than it needs to be\n\nOkay, now onto the actual conflict at hand. I think it\u2019s preposterous that he is blaming you over a very simple misunderstanding that a toddler made. At the same time though you don\u2019t seem to be very supportive about the situation either, or really acknowledge that he is hurt, and trying his best to prove to her that he actually does live there while also working hard and traveling to provide for the family. \n\nI think a good, long talk about these lingering issues would be a good idea and maybe try to understand each other better and see what kind of solutions or compromises are available rather than battle it out. Best of luck!", "Info: What have you said to your daughter, when the topic comes up?\n\nHow feasible is it for your husband to cut his hours/travel?

If so why? Is there a way to move closer to his workplace so travel can be cut down?\n\nRelationships are a give and take thing. If moving closer to his HQ will allow him more time with his family I'd say that's a worthy thing to pursue.", "INFO\n\nespecially the last part about you and the HQ. What if you wanted to live where you did and now he has a 2 hour daily commute, and he needs to do it to support the family? Not saying this is the case. \n\nthings to consider. Is he the primary breadwinner and is the income needed to support the family? Is he happy with his job, and could he easily get just as good of a job where he works less, makes as much, and is happy? This may be possible but isnt easy. Not saying he is the breadwinner but assuming this is the best he can do and he is doing it to support the family then he is doing the right thing, right? And if he is working/commuting more to support things you want, like living further from where he works, that is more sacrafice on his part. \n\nThings to consider, that ran through my head. As noted none of this may be the case, you could easily be making far more, and working closer to your job.", "INFO: Are you working and if not why don't you move somewhere more convenient for him?", "Info: Why are you the reason you don't live closer to his work? If his job requires him to be at HQ a lot then you either need to find a way to move closer or he needs to find another job. But you've left a lot of details out here so it's hard to make a call. Do you work too? Would it be fairly easy for your husband to get a job closer to home? Is he just traveling to HQ or is he traveling elsewhere (i.e. it doesn't matter where you live because he'll have to travel no matter what)? When your daughter insisted he lived elsewhere, what did you tell her?\n\nI understand your frustration with him being away a lot so it sounds like you let your daughter's comment stand uncorrected as a means to drive your point home and punish him.", "From the info you've given it sounds like his being away so often is a necessity and in that case you should absolutely do more to reassure your daughter. YTA.", "YTA. I'm sorry, but this is on you. I grew up with my dad being a long haul truck driver. I would see him for about three days every 2-3 weeks. I ALWAYS knew he lived with me and my mom and counted down the days until I could see him again. My mom would say things like \"daddy will be home in two days,\" or \"we are going to go on a trip when dad gets home\" when he was gone. She always emphasized we were his home.", "In the moment, you say \"no honey, that's dad, he lives here but he works hard for our family and he has to sleep in hotels for work sometimes.\". Once your daughter is in bed, then you have the adult conversation with your spouse. \n\nI dunno if YTA fits here, but probably. It seems to me that you don't want to correct her because it gives you a point in the fight with your hubby. That's pretty rude to your spouse, and also not fair to your daughter, don't involve her in this.", "With the facts as they are presented, YTA. He works away a lot, I can relate to that. Why is it because of you that he has to travel so much? What have you done / said to reassure the children that he's their parent and does want to be a part of their life? Why was there a fight about his travel? On the flip side, how did he manage to be home more as a consequence of the argument if this was unachievable before it happened? Too many questions to answer here really...", "From what I\u2019ve just read YTA. He\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing to support the family, YOUR family. Do you actually think he likes being away from his family like he is? It sounds to me like you resent him and are not putting the effort into your daughter and explaining that Daddy is away at work and will be home, how else would she think he doesn\u2019t line there? On the other hand maybe he just wants to be away from you", "YTA for piling on. Why don't you move closer so you can be with your husband more and he can be with his kids? If he is the primary earner and paying the bills why wouldn't you want to move and support your husband.", "YTA.\n\nHave you ever tried, I dunno, correcting your daughter when she says that?", "YTA you resent that he is not home more often and therefore are most likely not doing anything to help your daughter understand that her dad lives with you. I think you are using it as a sort of punishment. Like would the sentence \"daddy is coming home soon\" not ever come up? I feel like you didn't correct the daughter at all when she thought that. Comfort your husband instead. Why are you punishing him for working far away when you chose to move away?", "YTA. Based on the info provided it sounds like you are letting your bitterness that he\u2019s gone so much get in the way of making this easier for your kids.", "YTA because you are a parent here as well. It is *equally* your job to educate your child. If she cannot believe her dad, then *you* have a responsibility to teach her.\n\nAnd no, she absolutely is *not* too young. My child had to learn a similar lesson at the age of 2. It's easy to explain things if you actually try.\n\nUntold numbers of families live in similar situations. Their children typically still know their parents live in the home.\n\nYou're being deliberately obtuse to punish your husband for his time away, and it's going to end up harming your child.\n\nYou should try communicating with the other adult, like an adult, rather than weaponizing your child.", "YTA if it's your fault that y'all don't live closer to his work. Also, I hope you corrected your daughter. If not, that makes you at even bigger A.", "Info: Did he take the job knowing he had to travel? Why does he blame you for not living in the same city? How would it be your fault that your toddler doesn\u2019t think her father lives there? Are you saying anything negative around your 3 year old about him working far away? \n\nWithout any more information I\u2019m going to go with NTA.  \n\nLots of people are in relationships where one of them has to relocate for work or be gone for work. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault really a lot of times because sometimes it\u2019s the only job you can get. Or the only one that will pay you enough. \n\nMy family did this for about 2 years and it was hard but we made it work. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of way your husband could communicate with his children while he\u2019s gone. He could do FaceTime bedtime stories. He could come home for weekends or more often if that\u2019s an option. Maybe you and your children could visit that city on the weekend.\n\nWhat he shouldn\u2019t be doing is getting angry at what a toddler thinks and blaming it on you. Toddlers think and say all kinds of stuff.", "YTA if he\u2019s just doing his job. If he\u2019s picking up extra shifts, going out after work, etc that\u2019s a different story.", "ESH - you should move closer to the company or part way there? Is he a flight away? A long drive? This is headed to divorce if you don\u2019t move or he doesn\u2019t switch jobs or go partly remote. Also your kids won\u2019t know their dad - he will be like a visiting Grandparent. Sounds like he has some control and can do more to be at home which he should be doing.", "YTA, thats a pretty mean thing to say to a significant other when they're feeling down. Doubly so if he actually did move away from his job for you", "YTA. Sounds like he is doing everything he can to be around his family while providing financial support, and you are acting like he is an asshole for it. If you absolutely can't get yourself to move closer to where he works, you could at least be supportive of him and try to help your daughter understand that he loves you and her and his home is where his family is.", "NTA and it makes me laugh and cry at the same time. Its funny coming from a 3 year old on when her daddy is going home as he's married to his work and sad on how little she gets to see him and on all he's missing out on. Pretty soon she will be grow up and will have friends and get on with her life. Either way he needs to be at home more if he wants to change the perception with his daughter and nothing you do is going to work. Next time he brings it up, ask him if he wants you to get a blow up doll to replace him or how you are supposed to tell the little girl daddy lives at home when he's never at home. Hope the little angel is keeping well and is getting plenty of time from mommy.", "ESH. Your husband should prioritise spending more time with your kids, especially during their formative years. However, you should be trying to make your kids understand that their dad isn\u2019t somebody who \u2018just visits\u2019 and is, in fact, a permanent and important part of their lives. After all, i\u2019m assuming he\u2019s working with the goal of supporting the family. In my limited opinion based off the info provided, you two need to converse and get your priorities straight. Talk through the issues and try to fix them, or at least come to a compromise where both of you and the kids will be happier.", "NTA for not trying to convince the 3 year old that he lives there but this is with the assumption that you actually did correct her.  However, you are the asshole for using your 3 year olds confusion to make your husband feel bad about something that he already feels bad about.  \n\nIt sounds like you want your way and only your way without compromise.  This may or may not be the truth - I only see what you wrote here but ponder it because I don't see this marriage going far without you two coming together on this matter (and that doesn't mean him doing all of the work to suit you).", "NAH, 3 year olds just think different. My wife worked evenings getting home a bit after our daughter was in bed, and my daughter was convinced she didn't sleep because she thought she worked all night. She also thought a \"sister\" was just a good friend and you could ask someone to be your sister and they'd move in to your house. She tried to adopt a lot of kids at playgrounds. \n\nI'm not sure there's much you can do to convince your daughter he doesn't have another house. Maybe try to show her picture so of hotels and explain them. In a year she'll figure out how things work anyway.  Probably in her mind if you sleep somewhere it's your home, and if he's not sleeping there he must have a different home.", "NTA\n\nThe 3 year old is just noticing the situation and asking questions. Could you have helped with it, yes but why? When he is not there that is when you should talk to her and tell her he is working and needs to travel for work a lot. I can understand his side, but she is too young to really understand the situation. \n\nFurther , you are in a partnership. If his work HQ is elsewhere and your job keeps you here then that is the situation. If you created the situation I can understand his side, but if this was already in place prior then that is the situation. If he does not like it, then you 2 need to sit and talk about it and see which one is going to make a compromise and start looking for work close to home or close to HQ so you can move. Its a compromise so I do not think, based on what is here, that he should be upset with you because your work he in city A and his is in City B", "YTA based on what's presented here. \n\nBut I'm also sensing there's a lot you left out that would NOT help your case.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like he is working long hours and stuff to provide for the family. \n\nYeah, the kid has things wrong, and it sucks.  But your reaction is pretty shitty.  It sounds like you are using your childs words, and how hurt he was, to advance your own position of him cutting back on hours.", "NTA, and I say that as someone empathetic to your husband's situation.\n\nIf you had said this, or encouraged your daughter to say it, my answer would flip instantly, but it seems to just be a natural child's question. It hurts your husband because it's really how your daughter feels, but that isn't your fault and I don't see where you could have \"done more\". As long as you explain the how and why to your daughter consistently, you're doing your part.\n\nI hope your family's situation can change soon - this is obviously hurting your husband and having a negative effect on your daughter's perception of him. You and your husband need to have a good conversation about how to improve things if you want your marriage to last.\n\n/source: been the dad in this situation, it really, really sucked the life out of me", "NTA", "NTA, he feels like he\u2019s failing as a dad and projecting that on you. i remember having this exact same thing happen to my younger sister after my dad switched jobs while we were kids\u2014he was wildly upset when she wasn\u2019t reactive/excited after he got back from a specific trip, and it\u2019s like, what do you expect? they\u2019re young kids. they don\u2019t understand (nor should they have to) how the world works and tell themselves stories to uncomplicate it.\n\nhe wouldn\u2019t react so strongly to such a simple & understandable comment on her part if he didn\u2019t feel it were somewhat true, at least in spirit. maybe discuss intentional family time together or setting aside a routine \u201cfamily day\u201d when you\u2019re both away from work. this is an opportunity to connect as parents and spouses", "YTA.

It's tough on him, and he often acts out because he misses me. A quick phone call from me, more often than not, will change that. Idk what kind of work your husband does, but a quick phone call during breaks or lunch really isn't that hard to do. I'm able to call while working, even if it's for a few quick seconds to say hi and let my family know I love them and I'm thinking about them. If his kiddo is saying stuff like this, he needs to put in a little more effort to talk to his kids if he can, and let them know that he is gone so he can take care of them. You ALSO need to be assuring your children of this as well. I guarantee you, if he could find a job where he made the same exact money and could be home, he'd do it in a heartbeat. I know I would.\n\nTLDR: ESH, both of yall need to do better at reassuring your children, he needs to make more time to speak to the kids, and you need to be more supportive of your husband as well as take more time to reassure the kids about why he's gone so much.", "Considering you're also the reason he's working so distant from home, YTA \nYou should help your daughter understand the situation instead of being only a bystander.

This wasn't about the reasons for their breakup, or how he should \"take responsibility\" (which is laughable to say because you have no idea how much responsibility he actually bears here, or how much he's taken, none of us do, OP has given us very few details), or whose family was at fault (as OP said, people from both sides of their family were, so...you're wrong). You, like the OP, are dragging their entire relationship problems into his relationship with his daughter, which is WHY she's being an asshole. It doesn't matter what problems they have. She should have his back as a father. She should not be making \"well your parents were assholes to me\" as evidence that she shouldn't support him when it comes to their daughter.\n\n> he couldn't work through it as a rational adult\n\nHe was being a rational adult. He waited until a moment when he could talk it out privately and brought up how it hurt him.

When you have a family where one person travels for work, you absolutely need to rely on your partner to maintain your presence at home. That's what it's like to be a partner.

He isn't abandoning your family for weeks at a time, he is working to support it. If your daughter has convinced herself of something bizarre and upsetting why is it not your responsibility as a parent to reassure her?\n\nIt is natural that he couldn't convince her, but you know you could. I'm hoping you didn't refrain from saying something to get just to prove a point to your spouse... but it seems like that's what happened. Convince your daughter her father lives with you, put her to bed, and have the adult conversation. Don't use her as fuel for your resentments and don't risk her developing her own resentments.\n\nWhen I was 3, my father lived and worked abroad, and I apparently didn't even recognize him when he visited. But my mom reassured me my dad was still in our lives and we soon moved with him. It was a non-issue in my life.", "YTA. Straight up. HE'S WORKING!!! That's all on you to make sure your daughter knows. It doesn't sound like he's happy with the situation, that's a conversation for you 2 to have, but in the meantime you should helping to make your daughter aware that daddy is working.", "Yeah she's a mother and so she feels validated she's letting a child think something without teaching, or at least trying to teach her daughter. Sounds like she doesn't appreciate the sacrifice that's been made on the other end. YATA", "NTA. What child does not get something confused and mixed up?  When I was little and we were visiting my grandparents.  My uncle, who lived in Miami, was always talking about Miami.  I somehow came to the conclusion that \u201cMiami\u201d meant the same thing as \u201cmy hometown\u201d, rather than referring to a specific city.  Luckily I wasn\u2019t very vocal and I think I\u2019m the only one that remembers that confusion.  I do think that there is much more going on in this situation other than a three year old getting confused about where dad lives.", "NTA. This may get buried but I hope you read it because I can SERIOUSLY relate to this situation. I \\*was\\* your daughter. And I think you should tell him this story.\n\nUntil I was 5.5 years old my unmarried parents had a unique living situation where my dad lived with his family (parents, brother, SIL, nephew) and I lived with my mother in an apartment. The two homes were over an hour away from one another, so my mom and I would often visit on weekends and my dad would usually visit on his days off which were in the middle of the week. I was keenly aware of the fact my dad did not live with us, and ironically it sounds like I saw him more than your child sees your husband. Additionally, my mom had a few stories of when I Was about this age and my dad said \"I'm going to work\" as he was leaving and I said \"No you're not, you're going home.\" And once I guess I was upset he was leaving and he said he had to go back because Grandma was sick and I said \"But you're not her daddy, you're mine.\" \n\nWe finally moved into a home together when I Was 5 and I distinctly remember coming home one day and seeing him on the couch and I said \"What are you doing here?\" He said \"Oh, I'm not working today.\" Even at that young age, I realized he didn't understand what I meant, and the truth would hurt his feelings. I meant why was he in my home, and the fact was, I'd found the adjustment to him being around everyday more challenging than my parents realized. I had seen my dad as a bit of an...invader in my home, and wasn't wholly comfortable with him being there for a long time. And one time, my dad was shocked when randomly, when I was 7, I asked him \"Why didn't you ever visit me in \\*town I lived in with my mom\\*?\" He couldn't believe it, and it really upset him because in his ADULT mind he visited me frequently. \n\nMy grandma on the other hand? My mom's mom? She lived around the corner from me and my mom, and I saw her EVERY day. I was very close with her. I missed her terribly when we moved into our own house over an hour away (closer to my dad's family). Even when I'd lived with my dad for as long as I hadn't, I was still closer with and honestly...loved Grandma more. When she died when I was 12 I actually thought in my head I'd have been less upset if my dad died. And I want to add...he was a GOOD father, a loving one that played games with me, took me places, watched kiddie shows with me, provided well and I rarely remember him even getting angry with me. But we did not have that same bond. \n\nWhen it comes to kids, it's pretty hard for some parents to hear but with young kids? It IS quantity...not quality time that matters. Do the math of how much time your husband has spent apart from your child and with her, and explain to him what a big percentage of her life that has been. \n\nYou and your husband need to have some hard discussions, because he's going to permanently damage his relationship with your children if he keeps up this lifestyle. And honestly, if you are the reason he has to be away from them so much, you may also be TA.", "INFO. Where does he spend most nights?", "So my husband is in the oil and gas trade and is often gone months at a time. Our 6 year old is both on the spectrum as well as a recently diagnosed Diabetic. I used to be a hospital administrator but because I'm often called into her school (2-3 times a week) and with my husband often gone, we decided that I would be a stay at home mom. My daughter is my little mini me, my barnacle. My husband works for several months at a time but the flip side is that he has summers and the holidays off and is able to be home with us full time. It's a given that our daughter is closer to me but not a day goes by that I don't remind her that her Daddy works really, really hard and that he would love to be able to be with us more but that he's working to make sure we have food and clothes and toys etc. This has enabled her to understand that he DOES live with us but that he has to be away for work to support us. It's also instilled in her a sense of appreciation for the sacrifices he makes for our family.\n\nThe OP is definitely TA here. She needs to be supporting her partner and helping her daughter to understand the family dynamic. Instead, she's clearly allowing what feels like her frustration for being a part time single parent influence how she helps shape the narrative to her daughter. She's forgetting that this situation of her being a part time single parent is of her own making by refusing to compromise on where she lives. She's not only hurting her husband, she is doing her daughter a disservice by not doing everything in her power to help her daughter understand the situation that her father not being home more often is NOT because he doesn't live his family but BECAUSE he loves his family.", "YTA. You admit you're the reason he doesn't live close to the HQ, and honestly, I've been in a situation; not once did the family wonder if \"daddy lived here\". Sounds like you're not doing your part to keep your daughter's observation corrected.", "Please, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here \n\nFrom other comments and posts it seems like his family treated you bad. Bad enough that you can\u2019t stand to be around them. So you broke up with him and moved far away. \n\nYou got back together and he moved to be with you. But the thing is, he works with his family at HQ city. The family that treated you so poorly you don\u2019t even want to risk having to see them, which I think we all know is pretty likely it will be forced on you if you live close.\n\nAnd he refuses to leave that job. He would rather stay away from you and your daughter for weeks at a time so he can work with people who treat you poorly because it\u2019s important to those people that he work there. Essentially prioritising keeping his grandfather happy and working with people that don\u2019t respect you over being with his wife and daughter \n\nAnd now he\u2019s mad at you for not doing enough to maintain his relationship with his daughter, yet he couldn\u2019t even stop working with the family that treated you bad enough you broke up with him and fled?\n\nYeah. This is easy. NTA at all. \n\n*This is all hinged on husband\u2019s family being awful but I am comfortable making that assumption", "I almost want to say Y T A for leaving out so much key information. We shouldn't have to dig around in the comments.\n\nIn this situation, you're NTA. I wouldn't continue this relationship. This guy is choosing his parents over his kids. He's a loser", "Switch the genders of the parents and most people would be saying it\u2019s still the mom\u2019s responsibility because she\u2019s not home and what does she expect. NTA. Who can successfully reason with a 3yo when that lil kid\u2019s life and emotions don\u2019t match what is being said to them? It\u2019s the husband\u2019s job AS A FATHER to still be involved with his kid and reassure her he loves her. Maybe then he\u2019d realize his kid is 3 and that more than his grown man feelings are being damaged. The bar for fathers is so freakin low and it\u2019s still too high somehow. He\u2019s literally choosing a nepotism job over his kid.", "YTA for me as well.\n\nOP seems to be responding vaguely on purpose. The wife moved to their current location after breaking up with her husband a few years ago. The husband was forced to move to her location after they got back together. OP says she forced the move because Husband's family broke them up and she doesn't like them. OP even says that she always knew her location would cause more travel time.\n\nShe's not clarifying on the breakup. Without it, either she or the husband could've been the cause. We can only form judgement on the behavior of the two people.\n\nHusband still works at the original job because he's obligated to do so by family.\n\nOP doesn't say that her husband needs a new job. She just complains, blames husband for everything, and, like you said, is weaponizing their child.", "She moved away when they were broken up. And then refused to move back cos of their toxic parents. He knew what her conditions were when they got back together. So why is she obligated to move back under these circumstances?\n\nAlso, it's not her job to convince the child that dad lives there when he mostly doesn't. She can't change what the toddler experiences. Only the husband can.", "*Before* they married or had kids.\n\nSo the husband *moved to her city* and married her.\n\nOne of the reasons she had moved away was because his family was harassing her to the point of interfering with her job... which is a pretty good reason to stay away from a place.\n\nMeanwhile, he refuses change jobs because \"it's important to his grandfather\"... so the same people that made her life hell and wanted them to not be together are now in charge of his work schedule, and for some odd, unknown reason, he keeps having to travel a lot for work. What a coinkydink!", "My husband went to the extreme as a kid. He told everyone his dad was dead. Parents had split, and mom had full custody.", "How DO you spin it in a way you\u2019re sure they are wrapping their heads around?", "Per her other comments, his family actively tried to sabotage her job. If this is something they were capable of, it absolutely makes sense to have physical distance between their homes.", "Did you miss the part where part of what made her move was that they harassed her to the point of deliberately interfering with her job? Her personal maturity isn't the issue - their attempts to sabotage her job is not within OP's control.\n\nHaving a mother chased out of employment and forced to be on guard for the next attempt to destroy her life would be more harmful to the child than living in a different city than their father, where the mother can work and live without having to watch her back all the time.", "Sure, but he\u2019s still choosing his job over his child", "You don\u2019t typically see the steady, happy relationships needing to turn to the internet for advice.\n\nIt\u2019s a selection bias. You don\u2019t put armor on the planes that come back where the bullet holes are.", "It's exhausting. lol", "No he's choosing a financial future for the whole family over being there every night. Lots of people with families do this.", "Forgiven and no harm done, truly. \n\nI get most households are opposite sex and I actually truly am not offended when there is a heteronormative assumption made, although I do always kindly inform, just to raise awareness of the bomb-ass two-mom households out there! I did comment on another post this week! I spend too much time here. :D", "Sounds legit to me. I have no idea why these two people got married. She knew he wasn't switching jobs and he knew she wasn't moving. I guess the husband expected OP to be more understanding.", "Reddit users don\u2019t really understand how things work in the real world outside of their safety bubble.", "Yeah, this is an entire mess for sure.", "I completely agree!! That\u2019s why I worded my response the way I did."]}
