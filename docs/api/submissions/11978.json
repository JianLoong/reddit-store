I met the brides mom for the first time and had quite a few interactions with her before and after the ceremony. \n\nWithout being too specific, she made some racist remarks. I discretely told her that what she said was racist. Well, she didn't take that well and kinda blew up at me for accusing her of being racist. I intentionally used verbiage to indicate that her remarks were racist, not necessarily her as a person. I also purposely didn't bring it to other peoples' attention. My goal was to give her the benefit of the doubt while also informing her of how her words might be misinterpreted. \n\nShe demanded an apology so I said \"sorry for pointing out your racist comments\". Probably not the best thing to say, but I also wasn't going to admit to calling her racist because I very intentionally did not. She walked off, clearly unsatisfied with how things went down. \n\nI did not interact with her much for the rest of the wedding, but I heard from my friend, the groom, that she was in a bad mood for the rest of the night. When we talked, he acknowledged that what she said was racist and that she has said that kind of stuff on occasion. He was upset with me for not keeping my mouth shut and casting a shadow on what was otherwise an amazing day. The bride is pretty unhappy with me. I apologized to my friend for causing friction because he's my friend and we are at least on the same page about the racism. He's not asking me to apologize to his wife/MIL but I'm wondering if I should.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTl;Dr - called out racist remarks from brides mom at a wedding and caused some stupid drama", "created_utc": 1678470833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nvvqo/aita_for_calling_out_racist_remarks_from_the/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of older folks in the old border States and certain parts the Midwest use the phrase \"cotton picking second\" which has roots in slavery and it was heavily used to demean black people In the years following the civil war)*, \n\nOr it could have been a specific ethnic slur that warranted immediate correction. If you won't tell us you are by default TA.", "This is a bit closer to the meaning of my earlier comment. \n\nIf you wanted to follow this tack of generalizing from the principle, then this could also be a government that says you can't be schizophrenic or depressed, and it's also a government that assigns permanent meaning to transient beliefs. A person is neither inherently racist or non-racist. I mean, evolutionary biologists might disagree, but whatever. That's beside the point, which is that people change. Someone may be racist at one time in their life and then they may change and start working in anti-racism at another time. Should that be illegal?", "Irrelevant, if someone makes racist comments there's no gradient of acceptability.  Your Insistence that you're entitled to  a full transcript of someones ignorance in order for you pass your omniscient judgment is absolutely laughable.", "You are using a really particular, relatively new, rather narrow definition of the term \"racism\" that not everyone subscribes to. If you have to manipulate terms to make your argument correct, you might actually not be correct.", "Got it. Thanks!", "Oh sorry dude do I need to spell it out? You caused a scene over something I\u2019m forced to assume wasn\u2019t that bad and therefore it was inappropriate to say something AT THE DAMN WEDDING because you refuse to be honest. Until you admit what she said, by default YTA for causing a scene", "Fair judgement", "\u2026.because in another comment OP admitted that he knew she made the comments because she didn\u2019t realize they were hurtful, so that means she\u2019s not being racist", ">No one here is doubting what she said was racist. You said it was. Ok we believe you. But what specifically was said? Was it bad enough that you should approach.\n\nThere were multiple comments. I wouldn't have said anything if it was just an isolated incident", "I didn't cause a fight. I informed her and she decided to blow it out of proportion. It wasnt a hill for me to die on but I sure as shit wasn't going to grovel for her forgiveness", "Probably. I genuinely don't understand why its so critical to know exactly what was said. Why is it so difficult to assume that her comments were mildly racist and make a judgement based on that? I don't want confirmation that her remarks were racist. I've re-iterated that they were more in the mild/ignorant category. That's the premise of the question. If people think mild racism/ignorance with \"good\" intentions should be disregarded, then say so.", "They were more like the first thing and it was handled quietly", "Who manipulated terms?  My argument is rooted in fact and still acknowledged the fact that one can still discriminatory/prejudice towards white people. By your own logic you also \"might not actually be correct\".

And if you were so bothered by them why did you keep interacting with her?\n\nBecause I feel (again without knowing what she was specifically saying because you will not give examples) if I were in your shoes I would have just removed myself from the situation rather than potentially causing a scene.\n\nEdit to add: I have been in many wedding parties as a groomsman. I don't think I have ever said more than one or two words to the mother of the bride in any of them.", "Do people who aren\u2019t racist usually respond gracefully to being accused of racism? You have admitted in another comment that she was unaware her comments could be insensitive so she\u2019s obviously not racist. Your little twist of \u201cI said her words were racist, not her\u201d doesn\u2019t work in the real world. Responding with \u201cI\u2019m sorry for calling out your racist remarks\u201d doubles down and now you\u2019ve really accused her of being racist. Do not being the word \u201cracist\u201d into it if you want to have an honest discussion.", "Ok. \n\nIn the context of the wedding and knowing she was the mother of the bride you should have ignored what you saw as mild racism / ignorance. It wasn't your place to intervene.\n\nIt wasn't the time to do so. \n\nNot every battle should be fought. \n\nYou messed up and you should sincerely and porously apologize to your friend and his wife.\n\nYou should apologize sincerely to the mother of the bride. You may have not literally called her a racist, but she clearly took it as you calling her a racist. No matter your intentions you clearly messed up and insulted this woman. \n\nI think the reason people are getting annoyed at you is because your actions are pointed to by actual racists. They say 'look at people like OP, guess we can't say ANYTHING anymore.'. It makes calling out actual racism that much harder.\n\nYour refusal to tell us what you said, which is likely us wanting to believe that it warranted a response, is seen as you knowing it was such a minor remark that it SHOULD have been left alone.", "Yep, YTA. As everyone has pointed out. Take the learning experience that calling the mother of the bride racist at the wedding over a \u201cmicroaggression\u201d at best was wrong. Tell the groom what she said, he can decide how to handle it. We\u2019ve all clearly explained that what she said is important because the time and place is relevant. As I said, if she was sitting there saying \u201cI hate that my daughters marrying a n-word\u201d I\u2019d agree you should call her on it. But if she\u2019s just there saying \u201cI got extra fried chicken to make sure the grooms side gets plenty of food\u201d then it\u2019s fucked up to call her racist at the wedding. That\u2019s something that you take her aside after and say \u201chey this made me uncomfortable, I just wanted to let you know in case you were unaware\u201d not barging up to her at the event and declare \u201chey what you said was really racist.\u201d You can\u2019t semantic your way out of the fact that you did call her racist to her face and she\u2019s not.", "I don't think you're being genuine", "So an antiquated phrase? Since I don't know the exact phrase used (and frankly that is the key crux in all of this to whether you're YTA, ESH or NTA) the following is based on what little I know.\n\nI would say based on what you've written, you handled it very poorly. It should have been a \"hey could you not say that it's making me a little uncomfortable.\" Bam done. \n\nMost sensible people will say okay and move on, throwing the word racist on top of anything with the older generations (mostly boomer and to an extent Gen x) will cause a blowup no matter how well intentioned or correct you are. If MIL was throwing hard slurs left right and center you'd have been much more justified and a solid NTA as theres absolutely no place for that and no excuse of ignorance.\n\nSo instead I will say an YTA bordering on ESH. MIL shouldn't have blown up on you, but you instantly escalated the situation to 1,000 with extremely poor phrasing and timing for the level of remarks spouted.\n\nIf you're willing to provide exactly what was said or a close approximation of it I will reevaluate happily but until then this is where I'm at in my evaluation of the subject.\n\n\n*Some minor edits for word errors, like the word answer instead of as there's Really need to check my voice to text better", "My point is that not everyone accepts your definition of racism as a phenomenon that *specifically requires* \"systemic structures that actively oppress\" (your terms) the target of the racist speech/act/behavior. A lot of people use a broader definition that doesn't require that at all.\n\nSo you are exercising a more narrow use of the term than many people practice, and you can't just decide that everyone needs to buy into your restrictions on the term - a term which had a meaning of its own before the \"systemic structures of oppression\" caveat was added.\n\nNot really trying to debate ideologies here -  there is a lot of disingenuous argumentation in the Wild Wild World of Reverse-Racism. And recognizing the existence systemic, structural repression of minorities is important. But just changing the definition of a common word so that it can't be true that a white person can be the object of that term is just a little dishonest (if well-intended), IMO, and just makes the whole conversation more difficult.", "He knows he was an AH, that\u2019s why he refuses to give all of the relevant information.", "I mean, the same has happened to me. I accept the criticism and make a mental note for the future, I've even thanked people for pointing it out.\n\n\"ahhh im sorry, didn't realize that was offensive.
