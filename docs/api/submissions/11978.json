{"id": 11978, "submission_id": "11nvvqo", "title": "AITA for calling out racist remarks from the brides mom at their wedding?", "selftext": "I was recently at a wedding where I was one of the groomsmen. I met the brides mom for the first time and had quite a few interactions with her before and after the ceremony. \n\nWithout being too specific, she made some racist remarks. I discretely told her that what she said was racist. Well, she didn't take that well and kinda blew up at me for accusing her of being racist. I intentionally used verbiage to indicate that her remarks were racist, not necessarily her as a person. I also purposely didn't bring it to other peoples' attention. My goal was to give her the benefit of the doubt while also informing her of how her words might be misinterpreted. \n\nShe demanded an apology so I said \"sorry for pointing out your racist comments\". Probably not the best thing to say, but I also wasn't going to admit to calling her racist because I very intentionally did not. She walked off, clearly unsatisfied with how things went down. \n\nI did not interact with her much for the rest of the wedding, but I heard from my friend, the groom, that she was in a bad mood for the rest of the night. When we talked, he acknowledged that what she said was racist and that she has said that kind of stuff on occasion. He was upset with me for not keeping my mouth shut and casting a shadow on what was otherwise an amazing day. The bride is pretty unhappy with me. I apologized to my friend for causing friction because he's my friend and we are at least on the same page about the racism. He's not asking me to apologize to his wife/MIL but I'm wondering if I should.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTl;Dr - called out racist remarks from brides mom at a wedding and caused some stupid drama\n\nEdit since everyone is so insistent on knowing what she said:\n\n1. Claimed that much of the wedding staff were \"probably illegals\" and referred to them as Mexican (when they could be any variety of latino/Hispanic) \n\n2. Told me I'm \"handsome for an Asian\"\n\n3.

These are mutually exclusive of each other, you can be mad he used a term you deem offensive but you can also acknowledge what he experienced at the wedding was racist. Don't convolute the both cos it just makes you look as ignorant as the people you are accusing of.", "Tbh I don\u2019t either? PoCs are p good recognising the microaggression. And this was hardly micro but if it was you would then have ppl insisting it wasn\u2019t microaggression at all", "True. I can't believe weddings have become some kind of gate pass to bigotry!", "You don't notice the hypocrisy in your comment?", "So you think people aren't allowed to defend themselves against racist comments, nor 'the help', only people that actually matter in your eyes?", "\u201cSorry your mom said racist things about me\u201d also valid; OP don\u2019t apologize, your friends suck.", "Yea", "The amount of people saying he was an A H is alarming.", "Not to mention, Latinx is a term that was specifically created by queer Latinx to identify themselves because Latino is a gendered term.\n\nWhile some Latinos don't like Latinx, there are still quite a number of Latinx that do like it and use it.", "ohh that makes a lot of sense, i can see how it would be difficult. thanks!", "That's because it wasn't meant to be used in Spanish. It was specifically created by English-speaking U.S. Latinx people for use in English conversation.", "It will never cease to astound me how certain people can just say that about racism.\n\n\"It was bad but not that bad!\" or \"it wasn't bad enough for you to call it out!\"\n\nInsane. Crazy. All racism is bad. All racist remarks should be called out. If it's said in ignorance then tell the person it's a racist remark. You're not attacking their character or telling them to go to hell by doing so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome peoples tolerance for racism is just insane to me.", "Nope", "You need to give the apology too. You were a guest stirring a pot of crap (aka rascal MIL) the groom and bride knew was going to stink so they were smiling and nodding to make their special day less confrontational. YTA", "Agreed. I don't work in anything math related and people still say to me \"but you must be good at math, why choose do [non-math focused career]?\"", "Yeah, you would've saved yourself a lot of grief if you just laid out what was said from the get-go. I don't think that I would've been able to hold my tongue about those comments at a wedding either and you did it with much more tact than I would have.\n\nImo, I think that goes past ignorance and is just blatant racism, so I would vote NTA. Could it have waited until later? Sure, but the level of her comment was worse than I was imagining from your previous explanation.", "I've said this before and got downvoted to hell. It's no different than straight white people saying \"I don't use pronouns\". Most of the people complaining aren't the ones who would be using it to describe themselves.", "\u201cThe time to stand up to racism is when racism happens. \u201c \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "This comment was left before he posted what was specifically said. But let me be honest and say no.\n\nThere are times where it doesn't make sense. There are time when it does more harn than good.\n\nDo I wish that wasn't that case? Obviously yes.\nBut we're dealing with the world as it is. Not as we want it to be.", "Well you win the prize for being wrong. OP is NTA.", "Shockingly, the person putting serious time into defending a racist might not have been arguing in good faith", "her comments are undeniably racist. to the point where i don't know why you're surprised she didn't take it well when you called her out. that's the kind of life long old person racism that you really have to sit down and work through to make a change, not just say 'hey that was kinda offensive if you think about it.'\n\nnot that i'm saying you're an AH for calling out racism, but like... they're kind of right? you just met this lady and you might never see her again. if you want to make a stand against her racism you can make a stand, but if you're making a stand then people are going to take sides. just make a mental note of the kind of lady she is, and proceed accordingly.", "So...if people are racist but don't think they're racist we need to make sure they're comfortable? Who in the history of the world has ever said, \"I'm a racist?\" (Probably there's one exception to prove the rule, but no one ever thinks they're racist. Just other people.) Healthy people can take constructive criticism, even when it makes them uncomfortable, and do not take it out on the person pointing out THEIR hurtful behaviour. But the world is set up around not offending racists, instead of reducing harm to people of colour.", "I couldn't understand why people refused to take my word (and everyone I talked to) that she said racist stuff", "He didnt call her racist, he said she made a racist comment,\n\nShe didnt deny the comment was racist, just made the claim she wasnt.\n\nMaybe in the saw way people who makes racist comments on certain ethnic groups feel that saying they have friends in that group is some sort of defense", "**A battle that didn't help anyone, except letting OP feel good about themselves.**\n\nThis comments shows a huge level of, I am so sorry I dont want to say stupidity, but I cant think of another word.\n\nYou think the person replied to make himself better. People go to weddings to celebrate friends / family love, to relax have a good time and feel comfortable. They dont go to listen to people making racist comments and get into arguments.  Its depressing to hear or see people being abusive whether you are the target or not and whether you stand up to them or not.", "Absolutely disgusting take imo, the only time is if it's dangerous to do so.\n\nCompliance like this is how racists get to keep doing their thing with no worries.\n\nAnd is also more reason for me to stay true to not letting my guard fully down around white people, awesome. Can't forget that there's degrees of racism that you guys are ok with.\n\nOh no, no one better tell that lady that her words were racist! She'll probably feel bad and that matters most :/", "This is where we are. POC continue to either tolerate racism towards us or call it out and then apologize for making the yt racists uncomfortable. The irony of you being a \"model minority\" and having to justify taking a stand makes me so enraged for you. I really don't think you should apologize to anyone.", "Say he left. Would you have preferred that?", "the other two comments were still racist either way", "A lame joke, for sure. In your case, due to choices you made to follow a certain career path and/or hone your math skills. \n\nIn OP's case, due to an unchangeable part of themselves (being their race/ethnicity). \n\nIn OP's case, it is not only just a lame joke, its a racist micro aggression stemming from the stereotype of Asian people being smart or good at math.", "As I said in my other reply to you, fake friendo created this situation knowingly. He admitted to knowing the kind of shit she says. So, yes, he *is* fucking racist. And he can cry about it.", "Sure were"]}
