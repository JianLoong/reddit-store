God bless!!", "Woah, it\u2019s these misogynistic views we need to abolish. Poor you for having a father that thinks like this. \nIt\u2019s your wedding, if you want your mum to walk you down the isle it\u2019s your choice. \nNTA at all", "NTA. While it is considered \"traditional\" for the father to walk their daughter down the aisle, it is no way any kind of requirement or obligation. Weddings are about the bride and the groom and the honor of walking the bride should be done by the person of their choosing. What a vile thing for your dad to say. Even as a joke, it's not funny to say you're his property. I hope you have a lovely wedding!", "NTA. \nYour wedding, your choices. \n\nAlso that comment was wildd. Especially from your dad. Im ngl me and my gf make these jokes at each other but we have a weird sense of humor and we\u2019re not father and daughter lmao.", "Clearly NTA because you don't say things like \"you're my property\" in jest. I had a gf once whose father said he'd have traded her if the offer had been five camels more. While incredibly racist, it was also derogatory. If you accept shit like that as 'it was said in jest\", you're forever trapped in this emotional blackmail shit. \nYou want to give him a chance, do so, but for the love of everything, make it clear to him that this is the absolute last chance he'll get. \n\nAlso, show him up your female fianc\u00e9e (\"borrow\" one if you don't have one) and see how much he wants to still do it...", "NTA - even before the asshole comment, you are perfectly within your rights to select anyone to walk you down the aisle.  Since your mom has been your primary  parent for so long, it makes sense that she be the one to do this.  \n\nJust stick to your guns.  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding and marriage!! \ud83e\udd42\ud83d\udc97", "NTA. Oh H*LL NO.  He has shown you what he really thinks. Believe him. And besides that, YOU get to pick who walks you down the aisle, not him.", "NTA\n\nI understand your dad may like the tradition, it's your wedding and the entire day should be what you and your husband want.  Don't make yourself uncomfortable to please your parents.  I hope he's not contributing to paying for the wedding and would use that as some kind of leg to stand on.", "NTA \n\nHis put his sexism on show and then tried to backtrack", "NTA\n\nThat statement would have gotten him banned, imo", "NTA\n\nIt's your day. You get to decide who or both or if anyone, is gonna walk you down the aisle. His comment was out of line. But do make sure this is the absolute decision that you want to make as it is one you will not be able to take back once it is done.", "NTA. I suggest communicating. traditional mindsets are hard to erase but im sure after careful explanation your dad will understand your viewpoint. after all if he truly wants to walk you down the isle he will become more open minded. wish you luck!! im glad ur mom is there for you also - don't he afraid to choose her if that's what seems ideal. :) it will be perfect\ud83d\udc4c", "This whole tradition of 'giving the bride away' needs to die.

I wanted someone that knew us and loved us to officiate. It was beautiful and nobody batted an eye. Do what you want OP. \u2764", "NTA.  Don't let him near you.  Your mom should have the honor of walking you down the aisle.\n\nYou are NO ONE's property.  This wasn't a joke.  He actually believes this or he wouldn't have said it.", "NTA, but you do know that that is how the tradition originally started? Back in the day, when women were indeed viewed as property of men? Maybe he was making a joke (a bad one, for sure!) Anyway, we've come a long way since then and therefore you can choose whoever you want to walk you down the aisle.", "NTA - Being a father/mother is a title that must be nurtured and constantly improved upon and earned. I'm walking my sister down the isle because our father is selfish deadbeat. Choose who matters most to you. It's your wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt is your day and you have the right to choose who walks you down the aisle (if you even want anyone to walk you down the aisle). Dad is using sexist remarks to make you feel bad and force you to follow tradition. \n\nI would have a talk with Dad and state your intentions for the wedding plans. Tell him that he is still invited to the wedding, but that your choices still stand.", "NTA, you don\u2019t owe him a thing, walk yourself down the aisle, have your Mom do it, your grandma, whatever. If he doesn\u2019t like it, that\u2019s up to him to figure out.", "NTA. What type of father calls their daughter their property? A crappy one that\u2019s who. This dude trying to brush off his horrible comment as a joke shows he shouldn\u2019t even be invited to the wedding, let alone walk you down the aisle.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a joke unless both people thought it was funny.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding.  Your trying to do what\u2019s most meaningful to you.  You\u2019re not a bride I\u2019ll and you are most certainly not his property.", "NTA.\n\n>My dad was adamant that he would be the one to give me away and when I asked why she said \"you are my property because I'm your father so I have to be the one to give you to your husband\".\n\nI doubt he was joking. This is the exact historical reason behind a father giving away his daughter at a wedding.\n\nThe history behind the custom is precisely why I did not have anyone walk me down the aisle at my wedding. I am not property.", "NTA Your wedding, your choice. A lot of people have their mom or another person walk them down, even if their dad is technically alive and available. It's your relationships to celebrate.", "NTA.... I did a double take at the \"youre his property\".... WTF?!?!?!?! I would be LIVID. He shouldnt be allowed to do jack with that comment coming out of his mouth.", "NTA. You choose, and if you want your mom to do it then it is fine.", "NTA. tbh I never likes this whole \"giving her away\" thing, it's just like he said: it makes you sound like his property, and now you're gonna be your husband's property lol. if I were you I'd walk the isle alone", "NTA at all. Even if it was a joke, it was a very bad one. \n\nI generally never liked the idea of being \u201cgiven away\u201d but I love my dad and we have a great relationship so I did want to honour him by having him walk me down the aisle. So, I asked him if he would be ok if we skipped the whole \u201cwho gives this woman blah blah blah\u2026\u201d stuff and he was completely ok with that. Instead of that, our officiant asked the attendees if they would support and encourage us in our marriage so the whole room said \u201cwe will\u201d. It was nice because I was never property to be given to anyone and my husband doesn\u2019t now \u201cown\u201d me. Plus it was nice to hear everyone say they supported our marriage and would be there for us. It helps that we knew no one would be a douche-canoe and yell something stupid at that point in the ceremony- if I had any fears about that type of thing I would have skipped that part all together. \n\nYour situation is obviously different than mine because you have a more strained relationship with your dad, so I am not saying he should have the honour to walk you down the aisle but just letting you know that if you don\u2019t want to be seen as property being passed from your mum or dad to your soon to be husband, you can skip that part of the ceremony completely. Have the wedding you and your fianc\u00e9 want, that shows who you two are as a couple and individually. Do things that are comfortable to you. \n\nPS. I also know people who didn\u2019t have anyone walk them down the aisle, even some who had 2 loving parents willing to do it. It\u2019s all up to what makes you comfortable.", "Repeat after me Women aren't objects.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding your choice. And that was a horrible thing to say, even if he meant it as a joke(which I find myself doubting it was). Have the person that means the most to you walk you down the isle.", "It that was supposed to be funny, I am not laughing! If you want to be escorted down the aisle, I think asking your mother is a loving thank- you. Best of good wishes.", "NTA. Walk with your mom to meet your husband. She's the one who carried you when you needed it on your way to where your path meets your husband's. \n\nYou are not his property to give away. I hate that wording. Being 'given away' is exactly what that old timey nonsense is meant to harken back to; when a girl was legally her father's property, then transferred to being her husband's property. Throw the whole phrase away and refuse it's use!", "NTA, that\u2019s a stupid tradition left over from when you would have been considered his propriety. The world is better off without it.", "Ask him to explain the joke.", "NTA.  You don't have to accept that at all.", "Holy shit. What an inappropriate thing for him to say. You\u2019re NTA at all but he sure is.", "NTA - be prepared for him to pull funding if he is paying for any of it.  I suggest not using his money.", "NTA\n\nA suggestion - you and your fianc\u00e9 walk down the aisle together. Because you\u2019re equals.", "NTA Well, he could have talked all day without saying something like that ( as my dad used to say) On his own head be it.", "NTA. My partner and I have been discussing this for when we decide to get married. I don't want my dad to walk me down the aisle because I'm not his object to be given away. So we're going to get married in a nontraditional venue that doesn't even have an aisle to walk down. Just to eliminate it as a possibility altogether (and hopefully avoid hurting feelings at the same time.)\n\nBest of luck to you. I understand the heartarch and obligated empathy that comes with considering this question.", "Nta. You do you. If your mum walking you down the aisle makes you happy, so that. If the thought of being given away makes you unhappy then walk alone", "My wife and I walked with our parents to symbolize their support on our way to partnership together. But, we already had to be a little non-traditional because two brides.", "Its him, he's the joke"]}
