This is my first Christmas without my children since my divorce. \n\nIt was very important for my fianc\u00e9 to be with his family for part of Christmas because we fear it might be his grandmothers last one. So the plan was to drive to his family\u2019s house and spend a couple days and celebrate Christmas Eve with them then head over to my dads house Christmas Day to have dinner. \n\nAgain, this was my first year without my kids, so it was very important to me to be around my family as well. According to the plan, everyone was getting what they wanted and needed.  \n\nThe night we got into town at his mom\u2019s house we went to dinner and I suspect my husband got food poisoning because he was up all night in the bathroom. The next day he\u2019s still in and out of the bathroom and the poor man had it coming out of both ends. Christmas Eve was the next day and even though he wasn\u2019t feeling great he was there at the table, eating, and enjoying time with his family.  \n\nChristmas morning rolls around and we wake up and I ask how he\u2019s feeling. He says \u201cstill shitty\u201d. I ask if he\u2019s even up for going over to my dads house. He said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to miss Christmas with your dad\u201dand I responded \u201cwell I could just go for dinner and come back late tonight\u201d. He said no it was fine and we would head over in a bit\u2026\n\nWell, he went off on me in the car on the way over. Told me he was testing me and my loyalty but I dropped the ball and I\u2019m not acting like a true partner because I was just ready to abandon him when he was sick. Even though his mom and stepdad were home he says it was not their responsibility to take care of him. It was mine. That I should have called my dad and said my fianc\u00e9 was sick and I wasn\u2019t going to be at Christmas. \n\nWithout going into more detail about the fight that ensued, I just want to know\u2026 \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1672326530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy7lk8/aita_for_not_canceling_christmas_with_my_family/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
