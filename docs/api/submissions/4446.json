{"id": 4446, "submission_id": "zigu6i", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she can't cook in my house and not begging her to stay after she threatened to leave?", "selftext": "Today we were hosting a Christmas lunch at our house. Both (my husband and I)our parents were coming over and my siblings. This was more so informal hosting, my mom was bringing lunch and we were providing dessert and coffee. \n\nI've had a very hard week and my sister (Sam) is well aware of this and I asked her if we should just have the lunch at my parents house. Truly because i hate having people over when my house isn't impeccably clean and I didn't have the time to clean on Friday. Sam said no she rather be at my house. So Sam and my other sister (trish) came over to sleepover Friday night. We all went out for a late late dinner and got back to our house around 1am. Trish and I wanted to stay up and watch a movie even though it was late. Trish doesn't come up as often as Sam, so it was nice to make some hot chocolate and hangout. \n\nI asked my sisters before we went to bed if they could help me clean the house on Saturday before lunch. Sam was super annoyed. I told her that I offered to go to my parents house so I don't have to ask for help to clean. She said she didn't know that's why I was suggesting it and would've said yes if she knew why. \n\nSince sam was annoyed I decided to clean what I can at night (this was like 2am). Sam texts Trish that we are making too much noise and she can't sleep.  All I did was put dishes in the dishwasher. In the morning we all woke up pretty late and I got to cleaning and didn't ask anyone for help.  While I was cleaning, Sam wakes up and goes to make breakfast. I kindly asked her not to cook as I've already cleaned the kitchen and didn't have time to clean up after her. \n\nSam got mad at me and snapped and said I'm being ridiculous. So I left the room and she came upstairs mad and stomping everywhere so I angrily said \"if you are going to cook then clean up after yourself\". She goes \"omg you are impossible I'm going to leave if you continue\". I said \"okay then leave. Who's stopping you\". She packed up her bag and left in her pjs. \n\nMy MIL said I should've just told her to stay and made amends but I said I'm tired of her behaviour and her being so rude. If she wants to leave she's free to go. My parents thought my sister was being dramatic but I could've asked her to stay. \n\nCouple of notes:\n- Sam comes over often and she has a key to our house. She's free to make food usually and do whatever. She uses our house as an escape. She makes a mess but idc usually \n- had Sam woken up earlier and cooked I wouldn't have had a problem. She woke up an hour before everyone was coming and also didn't want to help in any way to get the house ready \n- my husband was going to go out to get breakfast, he just had to take care of the dogs first but she didn't want to eat out because she's on a new health kick \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdited: edited letters to names\n\nEdited to add: Sam is 23, trish is 22. I'm 29.\n\nAnother edit: thank you everyone for your feedback! I will be changing the locks. Sam is not welcome in my house anymore to sleepover. She can come when there is a gathering, but I will not be allowing her to sleepover.

She calls me usually to complain about my parents and Trish being messy and not cleaning up after themselves. I know they don't so I support her rants and I know how hard my parents can be. But when she's at my house she's annoyed at how clean I am. But it's my house? And she's a guest? When I'm a guest in someone else's house I follow their rules so idk why she has such a hard time understanding this. I understand we are sisters so she can treat my home like hers, but to a frigging limit. \n\nI usually let things roll of my back and not bother with her attitude. She went to Trish to say she's leaving and sorry for not staying to celebrate Trish's birthday at night. Trish didn't ask her to stay either.\n\nThere wasn't enough characters for me to write the whole story. It was a family Christmas lunch and celebrating Trish's birthday. I live 1.5 hours from my parents. They all love to come up to our house because it's impeccably clean. I know I'm a clean freak. The house is put back together within the hour after guests leave. Whenever Sam has slept over after a gathering she hates helping to clean up as well. \n\nWhen she comes over she never wants to do anything with us, if she does it's very rare. She wants to basically come here, use our house and stick to her schedule. Which I don't care about much because I know that's how she is. We carry on about our day and if she joins us for a movie or a hangout while staying here then okay. \n\nYou are right though, I need to stop letting this continue. She can't bounce between houses and cozy up to whoever she's not fighting with. She has a bf now and I believe she's trying to get him to ask her to move in with him. He owns his home and doesn't expect her to pay into the mortgage if she moved in.", "The dishwasher was already full and running. I was happy to have my husband run out and get some bagels and coffee but she was mad that she couldn't have eggs. We have an open concept home and eggs would stink up the house right before guests come. \n\nI did a load at night and in the morning I did another load. If she woke up before I was done cleaning the kitchen I wouldn't have had a problem of her making eggs. This was basically while I was starting to set the table, get drinks ready, and finish up rest of the house. \n\nShe could've woken up before 11am. She knew everyone was coming at noon. She also went to bed as soon as we got home, while I was still up. She slept from 1am - 11am. If I tried to come up and say \"hey can you make your breakfast now or can I make you something before I cooked?\" She would've 1. Been annoyed at me for waking her up 2. Would've said she prefers to cook her own breakfast. \n\nEven when we do cook she prefers to make her own food when she comes over.

Good guests always pitch in and help.", "My responsibility to clean up after her? Okay fine. But also my house my rules", "Yes I will be taking it back or changing the locks", "Yes exactly that. I've been having a rough time lately battling depression and grieving (I was pregnant last year at this time and went into preterm labour beginning of this year and gave birth to a baby girl but she didn't survive because it was too early), so her being an A H in my own house was a bit too much for me. \n\nWhen she woke up she didn't speak to anyone. Was already upset about something. Most likely because her sleep was disturbed due to me doing dishes. \n\nHer attitude has always been a point of trigger for everyone in the family because it's so unpredictable. She'll be raging out of nowhere and we are all victims to it. \n\nI'm also very sensitive to her being like this because she moved in with us last year. She begged my husband and said she won't be a bother. I left it up to my husband to make the decision so it's impartial. He said okay here are the ground rules, clean up after yourself, don't mess up our routine, and help out where you can. We did charge her rent, $200. She agreed to the terms. But of course weeks into living at our home her nasty attitude started to come out. She started to not speak to us because she was annoyed by us asking her to clean up after herself. She did cook meals and would cook enough for all of us, but rarely cleaned up. I told my husband that because she cooks just let it go. So he did. I also got her a job at my company. A PT virtual role. \n\nEventually she got a bf who also visited often and we let him sleepover whenever, including when we weren't home. We allowed her to use our car, only deal is she has to pay for gas. \n\nBut of course she stopped speaking with us, only being in her room, and it became miserable to live in my own home. So I told her to clean up one day and she goes \"don't worry I'm leaving your house soon\" and I said \"okay cool\". She packed a bag and went to stay with her bf for a few weeks. Called me dad and said she wants to move back home, and he said fine. \n\nAnyways, she ended up moving out without even uttering one word to us, and later breaks up with this bf and I come to find out he hated my guts, even though he was frequently at our home and had no problem staying rent free and using my food and utilities. She became tolerable again because she wasn't with him anymore. \n\nSo yeah, it's been a rollercoaster with this one. She snaps at Trish and my parents regularly at their home. We all tolerate it is because she fell into drugs when she was 18 and now has been 2+ years sober. We all came together and helped her get clean and my husband paid her way through a private rehab centre. \n\nSo yeah... it's been a wild time and I would hate for her to ever fall back into where she was when she has come so far. She doesn't say thank you or recognize anything done for her, but her being sober and continue to strive to do the best in her life has been really good to see. \n\nButttttt with all of that said, I'm drawing a boundary now. She's not welcome here without an invite, she cannot sleepover, I'm taking the key back, and will not be a doormat to her", "I'm very close with my MIL. She was asking why she wasn't here and she was telling myself, my husband and Trish that maybe Sam wanted to feel like we wanted her here.

We were supposed to celebrate Trish's birthday as well at night and Trish wanted to go out where I live. Sam is the one who has the burden of driving Trish here on Friday and then back on Sunday, so I left it up to her as she also didn't seem to be onboard about celebrating Trish's birthday. My suggestion was Sam and I go on a gift together but Sam doesn't believe in gifting anymore. Trish also doesn't need anything. She really wanted to just go out and have a fun time with her sisters and BIL.  \n\n- my plan was to clean Friday night. The whole week was a mess and I've been struggling heavily with my depression that's caused by the anniversary of the death of our daughter, which Sam is aware of as I've called her crying etc. Friday after work I crashed and woke up around 8 and asked my husband and our friend if they wanted to get a late dinner. I invited my sisters since they were coming up already. We came home at 1am. I asked if they'd help in the morning and Sam said no. So I did what I could at night. My husband literally couldn't care less if sound is being made. It was also for a total of maybe 20 minutes. \n\n- she woke up at 11, an hour before guests come. My husband was going to go get breakfast once everyone got up but she didn't want to eat out. She wanted eggs \n\n- time management is my fault. I'll accept that.

Hence why she finds ways to stay attached.", "Exactly. Letting her have the key, come and go as she pleases, making a mess and leaving it for OP to clean up has given Sam a sense of entitlement.  From what OP has posted here, Sam shows no gratitude for the PRIVILEGE of having a key to OP's house.", "So Sam likes to play silly games like, 'beg me to stay.' Homie don't play that.", "My fault, thought I had deleted my post but apparently not. Gave my reaction when I quickly glanced through it and saw more details later on. NTA!", "Oh for sure! It's always adjusting and growing. He does help. He was very tired from driving back and forth. We went out to where my sister's live for the dinner and then came back, so like 2.5 hours worth of driving. He woke up and helped. He does all the cooking in the house and take care of the dogs in the morning. I clean, do laundry and manage the household", "NTA It sounds like Sam has got way to entitled to your home and getting rather possessive over it and treating you as an inconvenience. Time to take back the key and limit her visits.", "This. OP, I was glad to read the edits. Someone can't come over and take and take from you, but not give anything back. Have her over less, and don't give her another key. If she wants to act like a guest, let her be a guest.", "Thanks for the explanation. I stand by my original comment. Your MIL expressed a 'this isn't my business and doesn't effect me' opinion. It's cool to just shrug those off. Hopefully Sam will go live with her boyfriend and you can be freed.", "After reading this I imagined a whole scenario where the phrase \u201cbutt entitled\u201d would work. *That reads way more dirty than I intended*. What I imagined was butt insurance like J-Lo had."]}
