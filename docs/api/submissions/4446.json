{"id": 4446, "submission_id": "zigu6i", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she can't cook in my house and not begging her to stay after she threatened to leave?", "selftext": "Today we were hosting a Christmas lunch at our house. Both (my husband and I)our parents were coming over and my siblings. This was more so informal hosting, my mom was bringing lunch and we were providing dessert and coffee. \n\nI've had a very hard week and my sister (Sam) is well aware of this and I asked her if we should just have the lunch at my parents house. Truly because i hate having people over when my house isn't impeccably clean and I didn't have the time to clean on Friday. Sam said no she rather be at my house. So Sam and my other sister (trish) came over to sleepover Friday night. We all went out for a late late dinner and got back to our house around 1am. Trish and I wanted to stay up and watch a movie even though it was late. Trish doesn't come up as often as Sam, so it was nice to make some hot chocolate and hangout. \n\nI asked my sisters before we went to bed if they could help me clean the house on Saturday before lunch. Sam was super annoyed. I told her that I offered to go to my parents house so I don't have to ask for help to clean. She said she didn't know that's why I was suggesting it and would've said yes if she knew why. \n\nSince sam was annoyed I decided to clean what I can at night (this was like 2am). Sam texts Trish that we are making too much noise and she can't sleep.  All I did was put dishes in the dishwasher. In the morning we all woke up pretty late and I got to cleaning and didn't ask anyone for help.  While I was cleaning, Sam wakes up and goes to make breakfast. I kindly asked her not to cook as I've already cleaned the kitchen and didn't have time to clean up after her. \n\nSam got mad at me and snapped and said I'm being ridiculous. So I left the room and she came upstairs mad and stomping everywhere so I angrily said \"if you are going to cook then clean up after yourself\". She goes \"omg you are impossible I'm going to leave if you continue\". I said \"okay then leave. Who's stopping you\". She packed up her bag and left in her pjs. \n\nMy MIL said I should've just told her to stay and made amends but I said I'm tired of her behaviour and her being so rude. If she wants to leave she's free to go. My parents thought my sister was being dramatic but I could've asked her to stay. \n\nCouple of notes:\n- Sam comes over often and she has a key to our house. She's free to make food usually and do whatever. She uses our house as an escape. She makes a mess but idc usually \n- had Sam woken up earlier and cooked I wouldn't have had a problem. She woke up an hour before everyone was coming and also didn't want to help in any way to get the house ready \n- my husband was going to go out to get breakfast, he just had to take care of the dogs first but she didn't want to eat out because she's on a new health kick \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdited: edited letters to names\n\nEdited to add: Sam is 23, trish is 22. I'm 29.", "created_utc": 1670737180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zigu6i/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_cook_in_my/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But either get your keys back or change your locks.  Stop catering to Sam, she certain doesn\u2019t appreciate you.", "NTA. Sam sounds insufferable.", "NTA. You don't make your own rules in someone else's house, family or not. She should've bitten her tongue, swallowed her entitlement, and done what was asked.", "INFO: \"I've had a very hard week and my sister (Sam) is well aware of this and I asked her if we should just have the lunch at my parents house.

Sam said no she rather be at my house.\"\n\nWhy did Sam get to decide?", "Honestly it was a mistake. Gave her a key because she was doing a solo trip north of our home and she wanted to stay here instead of renting a place near her hike. We weren't going to be home that weekend so we gave her the key to stay at our place over the weekend.", "Oh she brought her own food lol she hates my mom's cooking because she thinks my mom's kitchen is not clean enough. You can't win with her. My parents house is too messy and my house is too clean. But also doesn't want to move out and get her own place even though she works because she wants to save 70% of her income.", "Sam has always has issues with someone in the family. She calls me usually to complain about my parents and Trish being messy and not cleaning up after themselves. I know they don't so I support her rants and I know how hard my parents can be. But when she's at my house she's annoyed at how clean I am. But it's my house? And she's a guest? When I'm a guest in someone else's house I follow their rules so idk why she has such a hard time understanding this. I understand we are sisters so she can treat my home like hers, but to a frigging limit. \n\nI usually let things roll of my back and not bother with her attitude. She went to Trish to say she's leaving and sorry for not staying to celebrate Trish's birthday at night. Trish didn't ask her to stay either.\n\nThere wasn't enough characters for me to write the whole story. It was a family Christmas lunch and celebrating Trish's birthday. I live 1.5 hours from my parents. They all love to come up to our house because it's impeccably clean. I know I'm a clean freak. The house is put back together within the hour after guests leave. Whenever Sam has slept over after a gathering she hates helping to clean up as well. \n\nWhen she comes over she never wants to do anything with us, if she does it's very rare. She wants to basically come here, use our house and stick to her schedule. Which I don't care about much because I know that's how she is. We carry on about our day and if she joins us for a movie or a hangout while staying here then okay. \n\nYou are right though, I need to stop letting this continue. She can't bounce between houses and cozy up to whoever she's not fighting with. She has a bf now and I believe she's trying to get him to ask her to move in with him. He owns his home and doesn't expect her to pay into the mortgage if she moved in.", "The dishwasher was already full and running. I was happy to have my husband run out and get some bagels and coffee but she was mad that she couldn't have eggs. We have an open concept home and eggs would stink up the house right before guests come. \n\nI did a load at night and in the morning I did another load. If she woke up before I was done cleaning the kitchen I wouldn't have had a problem of her making eggs. This was basically while I was starting to set the table, get drinks ready, and finish up rest of the house. \n\nShe could've woken up before 11am. She knew everyone was coming at noon. She also went to bed as soon as we got home, while I was still up. She slept from 1am - 11am. If I tried to come up and say \"hey can you make your breakfast now or can I make you something before I cooked?\" She would've 1. Been annoyed at me for waking her up 2. Would've said she prefers to cook her own breakfast. \n\nEven when we do cook she prefers to make her own food when she comes over. She brought food that was prepared and it was in the fridge, she could have eaten that, but no she must eat eggs in the morning.", "Change your locks", "Ms Entitled Princess 2022 lol! Some people, water isn't wet enough! Change your locks, and don't let her back in till she apologises. Life's too busy for this time-consuming drama.", "Yeah? And? A good pan could literally be wiped out if all she's doing is making some eggs. I still think you're being way too uptight about this.", "NTA she wasn\u2019t being a very considerate guest.", "YTA your house, your responsibility", "Also you might want to rethink her having a key. She\u2019s too comfortable in your home, to the point that she is acting like it\u2019s hers and you are her parent figure who cleans up while she eats your food, messes your kitchen and doesn\u2019t clean up after herself like most guests, even family, would do as a matter of course. This is not a teenage crash pad, it\u2019s your home. NTA", "Sam was already making a fuss about coming up on Friday and wanted to come up with my parents to save on gas. I said that's fine and I said if that's an issue then we are fine to come down. The whole reason for Sam and Trish to sleepover was so we can do something for Trish's birthday. Trish wanted to come up and go ice skating or do something fun where I live, but unfortunately she doesn't have her own car, plus wanted Sam to hangout as well with us. \n But Sam as usual hates doing anything for anyone else but herself, so she was already being fussy about this plan and she was also making it a big deal with Trish, so that's why I offered.", "Retrieve the key or better yet change the locks.  You are not a hotel (maid) for your sister. Nta Sam us a huge one every  time  she comes staying  and even  more so for this occasion."]}
