NTA! The whole point of the initial consultation is to make YOU feel comfortable that he was going to give you what you wanted, and he didn't. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA: I admire your bravery. I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to do that.

If you wanted something adjusted its on you to specify that especially if this is the first time getting a cut", "Because you just showed him a picture and expected him to just know that you didnt want the cut in the picture. Next time you go to a new stylist tell them EXACTLY what you want, not just a vague picture", "Why wouldn't him picking up the equipment be the time for you to say something else?", "Yeah I understand that logic. It was less about that specifically and more about the general vibe he was giving that he didn\u2019t care", "It wasn\u2019t that that was the issue, it was more so just the vibe he was giving that he didn\u2019t care at all about.", "It usually would be, but the fact he just replied \u2018okay\u2019 just gave off the vibe he didn\u2019t care that much and that was a bad sign to me", "yeah this just seems like you were intimidated by his demeanor for some reason and failed to communicate. If you got a good cut at the end of the day i guess it's a minor thing but I'm gonna say you were the AH in this encounter", "Not intimidated, more so just didn\u2019t want my hair in the hands who didn\u2019t care, but fair enough, I see where you\u2019re coming from", "Barbers probably get good at quick but informative glances at reference photos; that doesn't mean they're ignoring it. \n\nTrusting your gut is important though.", "NTA\n\nI'm about to get a haircut myself after 20+ years of letting my hair grow. If the stylist/barber barely took the time to glance at the pic I brought along and just started getting ready to hack away at my head, I'd be hopping out of the chair too.\n\nConsidering your friend got a bad haircut from the barber, I'd say you were right on the money about how he'd have done you.", "I know right. I stopped getting my hair cut after I came out of the hairdressers looking exactly like a dandelion puff ball. Two elderly ladies sniggered and elbowed each other when they passed me\u2026"]}
