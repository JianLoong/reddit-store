I pulled up sources that weren\u2019t in my textbook simply because my textbook and I are not in the same state as one another. One of the linked studies was actually in my bookmarks from using it for an assignment on early-onset psychotic disorders.\n\nAlso as someone with both severe enough mental illness that it\u2019s warranted ER trips and siblings with more severe diagnoses for the same illnesses and (imo due to presentation of symptoms for them specifically) worse diagnoses than what I have, I\u2019m a strong advocate for getting early intervention for mental illness. Given that the longer you wait to start treatment, the worse prognosis the patient has, \u201csaddling\u201d an 8-year-old with a diagnosis like this is much better than leaving the diagnosis and associated treatments until the child is older. If a child is presenting with psychotic symptoms, you want to start the diagnosis and treatment process ASAP, as the younger a patient is at the point of first psychotic symptoms, the worse the patient\u2019s prognosis is. Like, period. \n\nIt actually likely would have helped if your parents and you had known about the BD when you were younger than the age you were diagnosed. My parent didn\u2019t get dx\u2019d until their thirties, I was tentatively dx\u2019d at 20, and My diagnosed siblings were 14 and about 8 when they got tentatively dx\u2019d and started treatment. The one dx\u2019d at 8 is actually doing better in the whole mental health department than the one dx\u2019d at 14, and part of it is due to the fact that they are younger and are learning skills to cope at a younger age. That sibling is also the one who has more severe diagnoses on top of that. The reason for the tentative post of the diagnosis is that my doctor didn\u2019t want to have a formal diagnosis linked to me, so I got an NOS mood disorder dx, with treatment for BD. My younger siblings got the tentative dx due to age, since they don\u2019t like to diagnose under 18s, but one sibling still got the tentative part of the dx removed and it being a full diagnosis at 16 due to symptom severity. So yes, the younger, the better, when it comes to this kind of thing. Especially given that to diagnose childhood-onset schizophrenia, you have to make sure the diagnosis isn\u2019t a mood disorder (like bipolar) with psychotic features. \n\nWhile I do agree that a second opinion can be helpful, it\u2019s entirely possible that they already have that second opinion, and know that childhood-onset schizophrenia is extremely rare. The first results on childhood-onset schizophrenia ALL point out that its rare. Any direct family (parent, sibling, child, grandparent) having schizophrenia can increase the odds of developing it. There will be additional factors than simply the grandfather having schizophrenia, but if a patient is presenting with psychotic symptoms and has a family history that involves schizophrenia, they\u2019re going to evaluate specifically to make sure it isn\u2019t schizophrenia.

Just my opinion.", "This is called \"gaslighting\" and it's abuse.

I am someone who has been hospitalized multiple times. I have read a LOT about schizophrenia, mainly because I hear voices. I was terrified of getting the diagnosis, as I already have a BP1 diagnosis and paranoia is a bitch. I also am not completely onboard with the ways I have been treated by practitioners, in hospitals, and by law enforcement as a result of my mental illness. I can't work full time. It's disabling. It has affected everything about my life. I have to monitor my thoughts incessantly just to avoid losing control of my life completely, losing my housing, job, etc, which have all happened before.\n\nIt probably wouldn't have been possible to diagnose me at that young of an age. Would I have benefitted from a diagnosis? I don't know. I was medicated from age 14 on, and put on addictive drugs without my consent or knowledge that they were addictive. My first psychiatrist gave me whatever sample she had in the office, pretty indiscriminately. I was on a hell of different meds that didn't work with no one who would take my issues with certain meds seriously for decades. And this was AFTER I was diagnosed as well.\n\nSo my perspective here is that we really don't know what the effects of antipsychotics are on brain development. And knowing people who grew up being prescribed ritalin, klonopin, or other strong drugs, I see a high propensity for addiction (in myself and among my peers). Many of these drugs are not approved for children (antipsychotics), but they are prescribed nonetheless. Would we be addicts if we hadn't been fed addictive drugs as children? Maybe. Correlation is not causation, etc.\n\nI just think a lot of harm happens to psychiatric patients, and when you're a child, you can't advocate for yourself. You don't have the tools to express what's happening when you're given pills to manage your emotions. I can't imagine what it would be like growing up on antipsychotics. I'm not saying OP's kid is on them -- I just know that as an ADULT, I didn't feel empowered to refuse or even express what the problem was with drugs they put me on. I also can't imagine, given what practitioners tell people about schizophrenia, like that you're going to have it all your life and you'll never be \"normal\" and any of the other messages that you get when they tell you you have a SMI -- being forced to deal with that as a small child and that being part of your personal narrative forever. It's fucking sad as hell.\n\nSchizophrenia is really not well understood. There are promising new therapies that may catch on for voice hearers, like Avatar Therapy. There is strong evidence that anyone can hear voices here and there and it not be attributable to schizophrenia. If you want \"proof\" I can provide it, but I'm trying to have a conversation, not write a research paper here.\n\nKnowing how compromised the rights of psychiatric patients already are in the US, I worry about how someone so young is treated, and how a child can develop an autonomous identity in the context of being diagnosed schizophrenic from a young age. Maybe I was reactive in some way here, but I'm speaking from the heart with all the experience of nearly 30 years with a diagnosis of an SMI and all the abuse I had to endure as a result.", "Wow\u2026 I wasn\u2019t expecting my comment to turn into a heated debate over very early onset schizophrenia. Everything you stated aligns with what I\u2019ve learned & what my daughter goes through. \n\nAsshole Enthusiast, I\u2019ve read through your comments and understand why you are taking a different stance. However, our journey does not look anything like what people would assume it does\u2026\n\nTo start off with, she wasn\u2019t meeting her milestones, screamed for hours on end, refused to be touched by anyone but me, was always hiding, stimming, no eye contact\u2026 cue her original diagnosis, autism, when she was 2 1/2 years old. Very early onset schizophrenia looks almost identical to autism in very young children. \n\nAt 4 1/2 she began saying words, but it wasn\u2019t until she was 7 that she was able to verbalize her hellish reality. Many little kids have imaginary friends, so I never really thought much of that. She couldn\u2019t focus on anything or have a conversation longer than 20 seconds, but that\u2019s not abnormal for an autistic child either.  But when black shadows were chasing after her, \u201c ripping at her skin,\u201d the voices told her everyone hated her and wanted her die, she began pulling out chunks of her hair due to the anxiety, but it\u2019s her delusional thinking that truly breaks my heart. From my standpoint, there is nothing more horrific than the things she has convinced herself of. I don\u2019t want to share much on that, but the hardest thing I have ever done was walking away from my daughter and leaving her at the pediatric behavioral health psych unit because she tried to kill herself. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself\u2026\n\n\nThere were countless tests, doctor appointments, anything and everything was ruled out. But that\u2019s the kicker when it comes to schizophrenia, there is no test to prove it. Yes, grey matter blah blah\u2026 that takes 10 years. Typically, a psychiatrist (team) evaluates a patient for 6 months to get a diagnosis, but being so young he evaluated her over 8 months. She was in a constant state of psychosis. \n\nThe number one question I\u2019m asked is how do I really know her team of doctors diagnosed her correctly? The week she turned 8 years old she started taking antipsychotics. On the third day it was like I was meeting my daughter for the first time. She had a real conversation with me for the first time in her life. She could talk about the things she liked, where she wanted to go, what she wanted to eat\u2026. It was like miracle drug that gave me my daughter. But like all miracle drugs there are horrific side affects. Again, I get ahead of myself. Her imaginary friends that she had for years disappeared and she was heartbroken. A mom in one of my support groups told me to have a funeral for them, which we did, she drew pictures and spoke about the things she had done with them. It worked for awhile, but they never stay gone and one of them went from being a friend to being the voice in her head telling her to kill herself. Fast forward to now\u2026 she\u2019s 14 now. She has tardive dyskinesia making her foot turn in, she struggles running and with stairs, her tongue and leg muscles tic, there are days we don\u2019t understand her (something we call word salad in our community), days I can\u2019t let her out if my site due to safety concerns, I can go one but there is no need\u2026 genetic testing didn\u2019t really steer us toward finding the right cocktail of meds to keep her stable but that\u2019s a constant change with her going through puberty. \n\nAnyway, she was 1 in 40,000 kids to be diagnosed when she was 8 years old. She has biweekly intensive therapy / social skills and monthly psych. All case studies show that the earlier mental health interventions are in place, the better off the person is. But the very few case studies ever done on very early onset kids show that these kids have the most severe symptoms as they get older. I have tried to Jam Pack my kids life with adventures and the best memories possible because I don\u2019t know how long we can keep her in reality. The number 1 cause of death for schizophrenics is suicide, typically in their 30s. That scares the hell out of me\u2026 \n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m saying is that this journey F*cking sucks and I\u2019ve had MANY doctors opinions and they all lead to the same conclusion\u2026 that my kid will probably not live in the same reality as me in her early / mid 20s. Unless there is some amazing medical breakthrough soon, she will get lost and there is nothing worse than mourning your child (or what could have been) when they are physically there but not mentally. \n\nGoing back to my father being schizophrenic and not being told about it\u2026 I hadn\u2019t given a lot of details in my first post, but after doing a lot of research on his side of the family I found out mental health issues was and is a very prevalent. Though you may feel differently, psychiatrists do believe genetics is a very important factor. Many people are triggered by drugs and/ or traumatic events. It just so happened my fathers was triggered being a gunner in the Big Windy. My daughter did not have a triggering factor, so it\u2019s believed she was just born this way. \n\nNot sure what else to say. I love my kid and I\u2019m going to make her life as good as I possibly can\u2026 but I did just yell at her to clean her room. \ud83d\ude0a", "In some places there's still a lot of stigma around having a child without being married.

The meds always seemed to make me worse so they were constantly switching to others. But I was always on a high dose of one antipsychotic or another. I started using substances around 11 and abusing them by 12. So I was in and out of psych hospitals throughout my adolescence, teens, and 20s. When I was 30yrs old I decided I no longer wanted to be an addict so I went to an intensive 60 day inpatient rehab. While talking with the psychiatrist at that rehab during my second session he asked me if anyone had ever mentioned the possibility that I had ADHD and I said no. He then said he was getting the impression that it was very possible that I didn't have Bipolar disorder and instead had ADHD. Also that he theorized it was the antipsychotics I was taking that was causing me to exhibit my periods of deep depression. He then asked if I would be okay with tapering off my antipsychotic med and possibly transition me to a stimulant if need be. I decided to give it a go since I was medically supervised. Within 3 days of completely getting off my antipsychotic my anhedonia and depression lifted and 3 or 4 days after that he started me on a stimulant.
