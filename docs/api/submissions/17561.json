Fast forward to my 8 year old getting diagnosed with schizophrenia. I\u2019m sure you can imagine how f**King mad I was when my mother shrugged her shoulders and told me she wasn\u2019t surprised.

Whatever you went through, your dad probably went through a lot worse and normalized it.

A word from your own father could have helped you at least understand yourself. I understand being mad and reacting the way you did, and he's the \"adult,\" so you'd think he'd be able to take it or at least empathize with your position.   \n\n\nI just want to point out that people who lived their whole lives without treatment, and if your dad went through the army with untreated ADHD, he \\*suffered\\* for it, have a tendency toward denial about the trauma it caused.  He has probably normalized all he went through as \"not a big deal,\" and so he's going to have trouble empathizing with you or seeing where seeking a diagnosis earlier would have been the right thing to do.  \n\n\nThat said, if I were you, I wouldn't worry about being the asshole or not. Your reaction was understandable, and your dad seems pretty checked out of your life and uninterested in your feelings. His perspective is probably limited by his own denial, and it's not likely he's going to see what a huge mistake he made if his reaction to your outburst is any indication.", "NTA He might've very well given you a worse start in life depending on how bad your grades were from what they otherwise would've been.

It also seems like you live with your mom, so he may have been unaware of how severe this has become for you. However, he should have mentioned some of the signs to your mom, and taken you in for an assessment a few years ago.\n\nYou were over the top.
