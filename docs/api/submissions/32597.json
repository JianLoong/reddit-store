{"id": 32597, "submission_id": "18dmq7o", "title": "AITA for not keeping my ex-wife stuff for over 2 years while she \"figured it out\"", "selftext": "So me and my ex-wife were married for a little over year when she came home from a girls trip and decided she didn't want to be married anymore. Wouldn't really give me a reason for this, didn't want to discuss it unless it was with a therapist, which I didn't want to do unless she told me first because I didn't want to be blindsided by something with a stranger present. Long story short, I could have been a better husband, she could have been a better wife. But we separated, divorced, and that was fall of '21. \nFast forward to now. We've had very minimal contact (for taxes or mail, stuff like that) but have been very civil with each other. So this past summer I hadn't heard from her for months and wanted to clean out my garage. Some totes of clothes and decorations that I'll never use. So away it went to the trash or donated. \nNow when we first separated I gave her plenty of time and opportunity to remove her items from the house(anything that wasn't blanetly mine like my PC or guns or stuff like that. I honestly just wanted her out of my life so I told her to take whatever she wanted), even leaving the locks unchanged for a whole year after divorcing because up till then her name was still on then deed to the home.\nI guess she moved away after the divorce to another state? I'm unsure as I just didn't ask and didn't care.\nSo recently she text me and said she would be in town and asked if she could come get her stuff and remove some of the house hold items as well like a gas grill and a table. Items we got when we were together and have been left with me and used by me for the past two years and the items that I've gotten rid of. So am I the asshole for just telling her no? I don't want to be mean about it but it's been two years since we divorced. How long was I suppose hang on to this stuff? She never asked me to hang on to it for her. Plus the common house items that I've been using, am I just supposed to let her have those and buy new stuff? I'm very confused about what she expected after two years of being divorced.\n\nEdit: There was a previously discussed time for her to get her stuff. (I'm going through text messages trying to figure out what to tell her) It was last Christmas and she never showed up because she said she got caught up with family and had to fly to New York for the New Years party. That was also the last time we spoke till now. \n\nUpdate: \nI told her her stuff was gone several months ago since she didn't contact me to get it after so much time had passed. I do have one item that I'll return to her because it was her family's and I didn't know it was left here. No response thus far.\n\nLegally I'm fine, I talk to my attorney.\n\nMorally, I feel bad but it is what it is. I truly figured she'd moved on so she didn't want the stuff. \n\nSpeculation about the divorce:\nI don't know why she left and I don't care at this point. Chalked it up to things don't always workout.\n\nWhy didn't I go to therapy? No, I didn't abuse her. I just wanted to know if I needed to get checked for an STI. She had already made her mind up about the divorce. I didn't see a need to talk about it and hear about all the ways I \"failed\" as a husband. I felt bad enough at the time and it wasn't going to change her mind on leaving so why do it.", "created_utc": 1702041789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dmq7o/aita_for_not_keeping_my_exwife_stuff_for_over_2/", "score": 2408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my ex-wife of 2 years that she couldn't have items that she left at the house since we've been divorced like the gas grill and kitchen items. Plus the items I threw away because they had been in my garage for the past two years. \n2.I feel bad that I threw her stuff away but I didn't know she wanted it. She hadn't said anything to me about me holding on to it till she could come get it. And the house hold items like the grill, I know I make more money than she does and could buy new items so I feel bad about telling her no she can't have them. But she left them here, we bought them together, so I don't feel like I should give them back after this much time has passed.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I came home, checked to see what was there, and fielded a couple texts over the next few days for specific things as she got set up. Then she came in and got something while I was gone and I changed the locks.\n\nAfter that initial like 1-2 week period, the only time I even reached out to her on anything was if I found something that was clearly sentimental and that clearly she had meant to take and overlooked- I found her deceased fathers army jacket folded up and put away- called her to get it, because I\u2019m not a raging asshole.\n\nWhen I sold that place a year ago, anything of hers still there went to the dump, unless someone wanted it- there wasn\u2019t anything clearly of major personal importance.\n\nYou\u2019re in the same boat- you\u2019ve been divorced for two years, she\u2019s had multiple opportunities to get her crap, and you offered her a full and fair chance to take what she wanted when she left.

At the end of the day, she could have gotten anything that was that important to her. \n\nIf she goes on an on, ask her how much she was planning to pay you for storage for 2 years because in the real world she would have been out thousands of dollars to store her stuff commercially. Oh, no intent to pay you but she intends to hold you liable for not continuously holding on to items that she has repeatedly failed to collect or call about?\n\nand then close with... well, just add it to the list of reasons you didn't want to be married to me and go and leave me in peace, please.

It sounds like you did everything you could to end things amicably, make the divorce process as easy as possible for both of you, and gave her ample time and opportunity to get her stuff.  At this point, I don't think I would even respond to her.  Legally, no matter what state you are in, I don't see how you could be held liable for anything after 2 years. And let's be real here, if she didn't care about these things for 2 years, I doubt she cares enough to pursue legal action now.   Ethically, you have done more than enough.

Two years is a really long time. If she wanted that stuff, she would have gotten it forever ago.\n\nShe apparently just thought she could use your house as a free storage service. Pretty disrespectful, imo.", "NTA. She's had two years and never gave any indication she wanted you to hang onto the items. Even if she did ask you to store things, you wouldn't have been obligated to do so after 2 years (or period).\n\nI'd tell her no and make sure she can't access your stuff.

So, hypothetically, she could have claimed she still lived there for that year, even though you're divorced and she has no claim to the house. Wild, right?

Pretty sure I didn't legally HAVE to do this, but there were family photos, stuff from his childhood, things he collected, clothes, and just tons of stuff (we were married for 30 years).

Wouldn't really give me a reason for this, didn't want to discuss it unless it was with a therapist, which I didn't want to do unless she told me first because I didn't want to be blindsided by something with a stranger present. Long story short, I could have been a better husband, she could have been a better wife. But we separated, divorced, and that was fall of '21. \nFast forward to now. We've had very minimal contact (for taxes or mail, stuff like that) but have been very civil with each other. So this past summer I hadn't heard from her for months and wanted to clean out my garage. Some totes of clothes and decorations that I'll never use. So away it went to the trash or donated. \nNow when we first separated I gave her plenty of time and opportunity to remove her items from the house(anything that wasn't blanetly mine like my PC or guns or stuff like that. I honestly just wanted her out of my life so I told her to take whatever she wanted), even leaving the locks unchanged for a whole year after divorcing because up till then her name was still on then deed to the home.\nI guess she moved away after the divorce to another state? I'm unsure as I just didn't ask and didn't care.\nSo recently she text me and said she would be in town and asked if she could come get her stuff and remove some of the house hold items as well like a gas grill and a table. Items we got when we were together and have been left with me and used by me for the past two years and the items that I've gotten rid of. So am I the asshole for just telling her no? I don't want to be mean about it but it's been two years since we divorced. How long was I suppose hang on to this stuff? She never asked me to hang on to it for her. Plus the common house items that I've been using, am I just supposed to let her have those and buy new stuff? I'm very confused about what she expected after two years of being divorced.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Craziest part of it was, we'd have the best sex ever that night when she got back from Karens (they were neighbors) and then she would breakup with me at breakfast. \n\nThe thing that ended our relationship for good was an engagement ring. We were engaged for 2 months.", "I agree. If she had cheated, she would likely be honest and ask for forgiveness or hide it forever. People don't tend to want a divorce if they've cheated a single time. You don't leave a spouse for someone else after a single trip and encounter with someone.", "Which I also addressed", "Not a valid excuse to break a marriage", "Nobody who asks for your grill and table two years later is polite or realistic about her stuff being thrown away. \n\nSounds entitled that OP is just waiting around for her.", "I mean I don't think you're wrong in this situation, but I'm getting very bad vibes from \"Won't tell unless in therapy\" and followed by \"where I couldn't walk away or cuss and yell\". Like this is very much a subject that I don't feel like we are getting the full story.", "No, but if you hadn't been 'on her' about getting it out, and just let it slide, she probably assumed it was no big deal.  So you text or call, and say 'hey, I need the space in my garage, when are you going to get it?' then, if she doesn't respond, you say 'beginning of next month, I'm clearing the garage.  coordinate if you want to get it, or it is going to Goodwill'.\n\nJust throwing stuff out is an AH move, even if it were 5 years.", "How do you locate the statute of limitations? Out of curiosity I tried to look it up, and got everything, but the answer I was looking for\u2026", "Of course Texas is like that, fuck your life but give all the rights to your property.", "That's totally unreasonable in my opinion. Do you know what the law is if you move and you still have your ex's stuff?", "Depends. Are your kids in college yet?", "I wouldn't want to go to therapy with someone who'd already decided to end our relationship either, seems pretty natural to me.", "Need to ambush somebody with a secret? Sounds like an abuser.", "> Her actions, are that of someone who has cheated.\n\nCheaters absolutely do not suggest couples therapy. She would have either carried on with the affair on the down low or just ended things.", "Her actions aren't those of someone who cheated on a trip. Almost everyone would either ask for forgiveness or hide it forever.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be married anymore\u201d isn\u2019t a valid reason to end a marriage?? It doesn\u2019t sound like they have kids or anything. What\u2019s the problem here?", "lol no she\u2019s an adult. Hes not her dad.", "Funny you mention it, my ex and I have been apart for 11 years now, and he still has some of my stuff (I moved back to Canada and he's in the states). We've discussed my stuff on and off and he's been selling items as necessary with my full blessing.", "Oh man I get that too, so rude! What do they even think?", "Try this:  [https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-laws-handling-abandoned-property.html](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-laws-handling-abandoned-property.html)", "I have seen a few who did.", "Doesn't sound like she wanted couples therapy. She didn't want to be married and only wanted to disclose why in therapy. That's not couples therapy.", "Nah it\u2019s not if you actually believe in marriage and not just the legal kind.", "Not if he didn\u2019t inform her. This is highly dependent on where they live.", "My ex waited a couple of years then asked me ( through our son) if I still had my wedding and engagement rings. He was wanting to propose to his then gf. Needless to say, he didn't get them.", "That's real property, and most states are about that long. \n\nWhere I live, it's 10 years on real property and 14 days after notice on personal property.", "True, however I'd like to point out that we have heard only from the husband of the marriage as to how things went. He even alluded to being a bad husband with a bad wife. We may never know why she did what she did, but she certainly had to. Expecting to house your shit with your ex-husband for 2 years, now that we can honestly say is nuts.", "I bet.", "> Doesn't sound like she wanted couples therapy.\n\nOP: \"Why didn't I go to therapy?...I didn't see a need to talk about it and hear about all the ways I \"failed\" as a husband.\"\n\n\nHow did you come to the conclusion that she's the one who didn't want to go to therapy again?", "Geez, the new woman isn't even worth her own rings? You did that poor woman a favor by refusing.", "Should have given them back when divorcing", "I think it\u2019s the reverse; FL is the new TX.", "She wanted therapy as closure, that's not couples therapy.", "Unless they were a family heirloom, I agree.", "I had a friend move from WA state to Texas and in the time he's been in Texas she's backslid from a decent liberal minded libertarian to a rabit Trump supporter.\n\nAND this person has a Ph.D in psychology. There's definitely something in the water in Texas.", "So your issue is that when I said \"cheaters do not suggest couples therapy\" you needed me to add \"as closure\" to the end of it? That's the point you were making this whole time?\n\n\nIf I had said \"cheaters don't suggest therapy\" you would have been fine with it?", "Not a family heirloom.", "i live in Texas.  the red sucks and is crazy", "I'm sorry.\n\nCome to Canuckistan! :)"]}
