Your mom has issues.  She shouldn't be insulting children: whether it is a 4 year old nephew or you, her own child.  Please don't take anything she says to heart.  You were just being honest and helping your aunt and uncle understand why thier son was upset.  Your honestly probably helped a lot because then they could actually talk to him about what was said and explain how those words are not true and not his fault.

I have no doubt your mom would've been caught eventually, but rather than let a little boy go through that you stopped it. She was and is behaving horribly. \n\nIt is not your fault. She chose to be cruel. She says she hates you and you betrayed her. But she betrayed her whole family by smiling to their faces and pretending to be someone they can trust. If she hates you for doing the right thing that means something is broken inside her, not you. \n\nI think it was incredibly brave of you to tell your family what your mother has been doing.

Who the hell reverse-blames their own child when the consequences of her actions finally reach her? Your mother is a lot of things, but an AH is the only one I'm allowed to call her here. \n\nDon't feel guilty. Protect yourself from her antics.

Again, this is a four year old whose only crimes as you've explained is, \"he's energetic and talkative.\" That is some disgusting behaviour from a grown adult, not to mention pretty severe.\n\nYou have to remember, your cousin has no real power to resist his aunts influence. He's at an age of absolute vulnerability, and your mother was exploiting that knowingly by doing this all behind the backs of your family. She knew **exactly** what she was doing.\n\nI need this all to be remember, because you feel guilty for not covering for her, but consider that if you had covered for her this would continue. There are some things you can't play secret keeper for, and when it involves your mother abusing a child that is absolutely one of them.\n\nFrankly, she's only levying insults at you now because she's experiencing consequences, but do remember that she's not a child. Your mother is a grown woman who is experiencing a grown woman's consequences for being evil. Don't feel guilty, and don't feel sympathetic to her.

You did the right thing.", "NTA - you told the family a bully has been abusing a child, why would you ever be the AH? Only by enabling this behaviour and not saying anything, that's how", "NTA. Everything you say about her shows complete lack of remorse. She couldn't care less about being cruel to a kid. What she does care about is people finding out.", "NTA. What's wrong with mom? The fact that she was so incredibly upset with you shows that she knows how horrible she is wrt Jack and she feels guilt and shame.

You are Jack's hero. There's something wrong with your mom, and her guilty feelings are not your problem. She deserves to feel really bad. Maybe if she feels bad, she will stop doing it.

I think you are one of the best people I've ever read about on this entire sub. You are special.

I don't know if I can ever look at you the way I used to.\" If she is ever mean to you, call your aunt and uncle and ask them to let you stay there for a little while. You might want to consider asking them to hang out for a bit so that you have some support from family members that will have your back.\n\nHow is your dad handling this? Is he supporting you or is he being a coward and supporting her in order to avoid conflict? If he doesn't have your back, he is a coward and then you will definitely want to get support from your aunt and uncle.", "NTA. You kept Jack safe. No matter what your mothers sas, you were protecting the heart and mind of a little four-year-old boy who isn't old enough to protect himself. He depend son people like you, to keep him safe and happy.\n\nAll you did was tell the truth.

You are being guilted by a grown adult who hurt a FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD, and by your own words has been doing it for... how long? How about how every time you see her you are reminded of how she spoke to a defenseless child and how little she cared about that? How about the fact that she betrayed her own family by treating that little boy so terribly and HER OWN BEHAVIOUR caused all this? If she hasn't said that, Jack wouldn't have cried, the family wouldn't have gathered, you wouldn't have had to say anything to protect that poor kiddo.\n\nAnd speaking of, if you haven't already I think you need to sit down and have a serious talk with Jack's parents.

Don't talk to me about hyper 4 year olds; they can really wear you out!  But letting yourself engage in mental games against them is really underhanded.  There are consequences to shitty behaviour.
