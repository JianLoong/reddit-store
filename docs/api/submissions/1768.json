Your mom has issues.  She shouldn't be insulting children: whether it is a 4 year old nephew or you, her own child.  Please don't take anything she says to heart.  You were just being honest and helping your aunt and uncle understand why thier son was upset.  Your honestly probably helped a lot because then they could actually talk to him about what was said and explain how those words are not true and not his fault.

I have no doubt your mom would've been caught eventually, but rather than let a little boy go through that you stopped it. She was and is behaving horribly. \n\nIt is not your fault. She chose to be cruel. She says she hates you and you betrayed her. But she betrayed her whole family by smiling to their faces and pretending to be someone they can trust. If she hates you for doing the right thing that means something is broken inside her, not you. \n\nI think it was incredibly brave of you to tell your family what your mother has been doing.

Your mother is a lot of things, but an AH is the only one I'm allowed to call her here. \n\nDon't feel guilty. Protect yourself from her antics.

Again, this is a four year old whose only crimes as you've explained is, \"he's energetic and talkative.\" That is some disgusting behaviour from a grown adult, not to mention pretty severe.\n\nYou have to remember, your cousin has no real power to resist his aunts influence. He's at an age of absolute vulnerability, and your mother was exploiting that knowingly by doing this all behind the backs of your family. She knew **exactly** what she was doing.\n\nI need this all to be remember, because you feel guilty for not covering for her, but consider that if you had covered for her this would continue. There are some things you can't play secret keeper for, and when it involves your mother abusing a child that is absolutely one of them.\n\nFrankly, she's only levying insults at you now because she's experiencing consequences, but do remember that she's not a child.

Everything you say about her shows complete lack of remorse. She couldn't care less about being cruel to a kid. What she does care about is people finding out.", "NTA. What's wrong with mom? The fact that she was so incredibly upset with you shows that she knows how horrible she is wrt Jack and she feels guilt and shame.

You are Jack's hero. There's something wrong with your mom, and her guilty feelings are not your problem. She deserves to feel really bad. Maybe if she feels bad, she will stop doing it.

I don't know if I can ever look at you the way I used to.\" If she is ever mean to you, call your aunt and uncle and ask them to let you stay there for a little while. You might want to consider asking them to hang out for a bit so that you have some support from family members that will have your back.\n\nHow is your dad handling this? Is he supporting you or is he being a coward and supporting her in order to avoid conflict? If he doesn't have your back, he is a coward and then you will definitely want to get support from your aunt and uncle.", "NTA. You kept Jack safe. No matter what your mothers sas, you were protecting the heart and mind of a little four-year-old boy who isn't old enough to protect himself. He depend son people like you, to keep him safe and happy.\n\nAll you did was tell the truth.

She's the one who was nasty to a 4 year old and it doesn't matter who stopped her.", "NTA. You stood up to a bully who was picking on a 4 year old. The only asshole is the bully, and she's making herself into an entire rectum and colon, too, for trying to be the victim here.", "NTA...However, your mom is being a King Kong sized one! The actual issue here is that your mom NEEDS HELP!  What is behind the hate driving this \"compulsion to hurt this particular little child?\" This is a symptom of a much deeper problem.", "NTA.  Stop letting her behavior affect you like this.  You did the right thing and called her out for her disgusting behavior to a child.  She should be called out and embarrassed.  But the saddest part, she didn't learn a damn thing.  She isn't taking responsibilities for her actions, and got exactly what she deserved.  How is she going to treat your future children?", "You didn\u2019t cause the fallout, she did, with her actions.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long she expected to keep it up, the kid would have told his parents eventually anyway, probably after a lot more damage to his self esteem has been done.", "NTA At all! Now she knows how she made Jack feel. She said you care little about her, yet there's a grown ass woman who cares so little about a 4 year old family member that she gets off terrorizing him & making him cry all the time. Everyone should know how she's treating this little boy & should protect him from her!", "NTA you didn't betray her you told the truth that she's bullying a child and has been for some time. She got what she deserves and can't hack it. I wouldn't let her near any children again. Don't let her guilt you into apologizing because she's the one in the wrong and she knows it.", "Why if it isn't the consequences of her own actions. Your mom decided to bully a CHILD and is now feeling sorry because she got caught and has to face the consequences. You did the right thing by speaking up, definitely NTA.\n\nAs a petty person, I'd get Jack some Robin merch.", "Your mom can sit on one \ud83d\udde1 and rotate. You\u2019re awesome and what you did is the right thing. Your mom is a bully", "Mom fixations on OP\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d says she\u2019s not actually sorry and didn\u2019t learn a thing from this.", "NTA at all your mother is a full grown adult bullying a child, she is the only one to blame for your family calling her to task, be proud of the fact you stood up for a defenseless kid, and if she continues to try to manipulate you speak up about it too, she needs therapy", "My aunt is an abusive narcissist, and let me tell you that the cruel words stick with you. I hope Jack\u2019s parents keep him away from OP\u2019s mom in the future. \n\nNTA, and you may have saved Jack a lot of problems by revealing this while he\u2019s still so young", "Indeed. And the last part just sounds extremely manipulative of the mom. \"oh poor me, I did something wrong and my daughter told on me. I must now make her feel guilty about what I did.\"", "It's called abuse. OP's mom is an abuser.", "I also am extremely proud of you! I really hope you practice running your difficulties by your relatives. It would help you to talk and it sounds like they would do what they could to protect you.", "Answered above - he\u2019s being very supportive.", " conscience, but yes.", "\"I think you need to sit down and have a serious talk with Jack's parents. She may try and apologize and beg forgiveness on a \"first offense\" basis, and Jack's parents deserve a full picture of how your mom has historically behaved so they can protect him properly.\"\n\nThis is a really good point.", ">\u201cI didn\u2019t betray you. You were being cruel to a four year old. You made him cry. If you don\u2019t want people to hate you, be a better person and stop being mean to little kids\u201d.\n\nTHIS \\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^ I can't upvote you enough!!!", "Personally I would respond that every time I look at her, I see a hateful asshole that delighted in bullying a 4 year old and making them cry.", "Is he by any chance disabled, adopted, of a different race, noticeably darker (or lighter) than the rest of the family? Or is he just this year's appointed scapegoat?", "That's what I thought. And OPs parents are getting divorced too.", "Can I ask - how old are you? I'm sorry that your home life is so awful rn, but you absolutely did the right thing. Here's my poor person medal! \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "Violence?", "Your mother's treatment of Jack reminds me of my mother's treatment of me, down to the rest of the family being oblivious.\n\nI do not have the words to express how vile and contemptible I find people who are like that. That poor boy is going to have a lot of trouble trusting people.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing. I wouldn't associate in any way whatsoever with a person capable of behaving like that.", "Go dad!!!", "yeah i think what you are trying to figure out is recognizing that your mom is a narcissist \ud83d\ude33", "I\u2019m 16f :)", "Dad separated from mom over this and is being very supportive of OP.", "They made the reasons why it was gaslighting pretty clear. Did you not read the rest of the comment, just saw gaslighting and decided to speak up?", "Gotta put your own oxygen mask on before affixing others'.", "With the boy in question being 4, the little brothers are younger and might not be communicative yet.  \n\nWhat I fear, based on the comment the mom made to the 4 year old about him being the villain is that she might see his race as not being on the same level as you and your mom.", "Ah GREAT! Then she needs to avoid mum and stay with dad.", "It\u2019s certainly a thought.", "Ableism, adoption, or colourism are other possibilities.", "Your mom is mentally abusing a 4 year old, but she is also mentally abusing and manipulating YOU.  You are just another version of jack to her.  I suggest going to therapy to learn how to deal with and set boundaries of narcissistic and manipulative parents.", "NTA. Your mother has been bullying a child. She is crying tears of embarrassment that her atrocious behavior has been revealed. Ignore her.", "Your manipulative mother is trying to blame you for her actions. I learned a little too late in life about how important it is to call out bullies rather than being silent and enabling them. Maybe your mother will learn a valuable lesson here and start practicing social manners. She knew what she was doing was wrong by signalling you to be silent.", "Your mother is sick in the head.", "Your bully of a mother got caught and now she\u2019s lashing out at the only person she thinks will tolerate her bullshit. So, don\u2019t. She made her bed by being cruel to an innocent child, and being duplicitous in trying to hide it. Your family is right to be furious. What you did was brave and the absolute right thing to do. NTA.", "NTA, your mother is abusing a child. She deserves what she gets.", "And also the only thing that would\u2019ve changed is that then her mom AND OP would\u2019ve been the bad guys, if Jack had this immediate reaction to her being unbelievably cruel and mean to him for no reason, he or the other kids would\u2019ve told his parents anyway. Mom needs to own up to the fact she majorly fucked up instead of blaming her daughter for doing what was right", "nah, someone can be evil without having any mental health issues. there are just bad people out of their own free will.", "I\u2019m so glad there\u2019s another one that\u2019s read far too many Reddit stories!\n\nWhen I then saw the parents are separating\u2026 it\u2019s totally possible (in Reddit drama fashion) that Jack is her half brother.", "Apparently, both Jack and OP are good like Robin.", "Right and then she doubled down blaming op when she got caught.", "Nice!", "Your mom is bullying you now because she's facing the consequences of her own actions and won't accept that responsibility.   \n\n\nIt's not your fault. You did nothing wrong. You refused to be complicit in the bullying of a 4 yo boy and that's a good thing.", "Go live with your dad, and only reconnect with mom when she is back to being healthy. You are to young to shoulder grown ass problems", "Yeah nah, your mom is racist af. NTA.", "I think there's a lot of bad blood and that op doesn't know any of it. She's 16, so she's still in the age range that older family members will keep shit from her. Maybe her mom is having a mental health episode, but it wouldn't shock me if she thinks the kid was the result of infidelity or some shit that led to this.", "Op stated in other comments that the kid is mixed race, but both he and his siblings are 'white passing' according to their mom. Op's mom is Jack's aunt through his dad, who is her brother. There's also a substantial age difference between op's mom and op's uncle. \n\nIf anything, I think the ages have something to do with it. That or she thinks Jack is an affair baby. Curious about any updates we could get with this one."]}
