I\u2019ve warned my mom over and over that this is all gonna bite her in the ass but she insists that she\u2019s just \u201clovingly\u201d teasing him. \n\nWell it was my grandma\u2019s birthday and the whole family was there. Jack was playing with the other kids and he was pretending to be Robin and another kid was pretending to be some villain.\n\nMy mom then suddenly goes \u201cyou guys should switch roles, I think the bad guy suits you more than Robin. Robin\u2019s strong, good and handsome... you-\u201c\n\nJack cut her off and immediately sits down and just starts sobbing his eyes out. I was horrified. I began comforting him and so did the kids that were playing with him but he was inconsolable and his parents ran over. \n\nThey asked me what happened and I looked my mom straight in the eye. She was begging me not to say anything but I told them quite literally everything. \n\nThey lost it. My aunt was crying and my uncle screamed at her for so long a crowd formed. Not even my dad dared to step in after he realized what happened. My grandma kicked her out and now the entire family isn\u2019t speaking to her. They said some really mean things about my mom too which no doubt probably broke her (and no one deserves to hear) but I just don\u2019t know. \n\nMy mom\u2019s been crying for ages and told me that I betrayed her and caused all this. She said that she hates me right now and that every time she sees me she remembers how I betrayed her and how little I care about her. It honestly hurts to see my mom like this but it\u2019s also deserved. The things she\u2019s saying to me are making me feel INSANELY guilty though.

You didn't betray her, were you supposed to keep her little secret?  You don't want to start down that road with her.  You did the right thing.  They wanted to know why Jack was crying and you told the truth.  Do not start covering up for her, that will not end.", "Huge NTA. She\u2019s bullying a 4 yr old!?! How is that ever right?!  You would\u2019ve been the A H if you didn\u2019t stick up for your 4 yr old cousin.", "NTA. As someone who has a toxic and manipulative parent who *always* plays the victim, I can tell you that the only person here at fault is your mother. This isn't the first time your mom has been TA, which is why your family was so quick to react the way they did. Don't let her gaslight you into believing that you share any of the blame here, it's all on her.\n\nGood on you for looking out for Jack, I'm sorry your mother said such awful things to you.", "NTA - Just to recap, SHE'S mad at YOU, because you were asked a question, and answered honestly? Don't let her pawn the guilt off on you - it's a result of her own actions", "NTA how can someone be so mean to a 4 yo damnn", "NTA\n\nShe sounds manipulative. I know it's fashionable to throw the word narcissist around these days, but I wouldn't be surprised if it fits here. It must be really hard for you to have upset your mum like that because you obviously love her, but you were right to stand up for your cousin, what she was saying to him is just mean and unnecessary, so she can't complain now and blame you, just because you told everyone the truth.", "NTA.  Your mom has issues.  She shouldn't be insulting children: whether it is a 4 year old nephew or you, her own child.  Please don't take anything she says to heart.  You were just being honest and helping your aunt and uncle understand why thier son was upset.  Your honestly probably helped a lot because then they could actually talk to him about what was said and explain how those words are not true and not his fault.  Without your honesty he wouldn't get a chance to hear that important message and your moms words could have deeply hurt his self esteem and self image!  Thank you for sticking up for the 4 year old!", "NTA but your mom sure as hell is one\n\nBullying a 4 year old? WTF? How low can one go?", "NTA - I know her words are hurting you because she's your mom, but what she was doing was wrong on so many levels. You stopped it before it got even worse and spared Jack years of pain by speaking up now. I have no doubt your mom would've been caught eventually, but rather than let a little boy go through that you stopped it. She was and is behaving horribly. \n\nIt is not your fault. She chose to be cruel. She says she hates you and you betrayed her. But she betrayed her whole family by smiling to their faces and pretending to be someone they can trust. If she hates you for doing the right thing that means something is broken inside her, not you. \n\nI think it was incredibly brave of you to tell your family what your mother has been doing. So for what it's worth, this internet stranger is very proud of you. [edit for typo]", "NTA...your mom's manipulative and AH.", "Nta - your mom has a solid mean streak in her, especially considering how she treats family, and 4 year old at that.  If you said nothing, you'd be just as bad as her.", "NTA and I kind of hope your mother has some undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues, because her behavior is far from normal, not to mention incredibly abusive and mean. \n\nWho the heck bullies a 4 year old child? Who the hell reverse-blames their own child when the consequences of her actions finally reach her? Your mother is a lot of things, but an AH is the only one I'm allowed to call her here. \n\nDon't feel guilty. Protect yourself from her antics. You did the right thing by being honest, so your cousin's parents can protect him from her, and so the rest of the family can decide whether they want to be associated with the likes of her. \n\nYour mother needs help.", "NTA\n\nYour mother was bullying a literal four year old. She was doing this to such an extend that the boy burst into tears from it, because she implied he was evil for seemingly no good reason. Again, this is a four year old whose only crimes as you've explained is, \"he's energetic and talkative.\" That is some disgusting behaviour from a grown adult, not to mention pretty severe.\n\nYou have to remember, your cousin has no real power to resist his aunts influence. He's at an age of absolute vulnerability, and your mother was exploiting that knowingly by doing this all behind the backs of your family. She knew **exactly** what she was doing.\n\nI need this all to be remember, because you feel guilty for not covering for her, but consider that if you had covered for her this would continue. There are some things you can't play secret keeper for, and when it involves your mother abusing a child that is absolutely one of them.\n\nFrankly, she's only levying insults at you now because she's experiencing consequences, but do remember that she's not a child. Your mother is a grown woman who is experiencing a grown woman's consequences for being evil. Don't feel guilty, and don't feel sympathetic to her. Remind her that she brought this on herself.", "NTA. If you didn't say something Jack would continue to be berated by your mom. That would DEFINITELY have manifested in his behavior. Your mom was a bully and you stood up to her. You did nothing wrong and your mom needs to face facts that everything that happened was a result of HER actions.\n\nNow your mom is guilt tripping and gaslighting you. This is incredibly manipulative and you shouldn't stand for it. She seems to have a need to belittle others (based on your post)", "NTA\n\nYour mom was bullying a 4 year old?! She deserves every bit of hate and scorn she has gotten. Do not let her manipulate you into thinking you did anything wrong when she at her big age was sitting there bullying a toddler.", "NTA. There is something just so wrong when an adult gets enjoyment out of tearing down a child. She's crying because she was caught and she has no one to blame but herself. She bullied a small child and couldn't handle when adults came to his aid. Don't feel bad, Jack needed you to be his voice. You did the right thing.", "NTA - you told the family a bully has been abusing a child, why would you ever be the AH? Only by enabling this behaviour and not saying anything, that's how", "NTA. Everything you say about her shows complete lack of remorse. She couldn't care less about being cruel to a kid. What she does care about is people finding out.", "NTA. What's wrong with mom? The fact that she was so incredibly upset with you shows that she knows how horrible she is wrt Jack and she feels guilt and shame. And she's doing some fancy mental gymnastics to actually blame it all on you. Good for you for being honest and thinking about Jack's best interests.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE. You are my hero. You are Jack's hero. There's something wrong with your mom, and her guilty feelings are not your problem. She deserves to feel really bad. Maybe if she feels bad, she will stop doing it. You did the right thing. It's really scary sometimes to do the right thing and you did it. Anyways. That makes you so brave. I think you are one of the best people I've ever read about on this entire sub. You are special. Never lose that.\n\n If she tries to make you feel bad, just say \"I'm glad that I told the truth, you taught me not to lie. Why were you so mean to him? He's so small and you're so big. I don't know if I can ever look at you the way I used to.\" If she is ever mean to you, call your aunt and uncle and ask them to let you stay there for a little while. You might want to consider asking them to hang out for a bit so that you have some support from family members that will have your back.\n\nHow is your dad handling this? Is he supporting you or is he being a coward and supporting her in order to avoid conflict? If he doesn't have your back, he is a coward and then you will definitely want to get support from your aunt and uncle.", "NTA. You kept Jack safe. No matter what your mothers sas, you were protecting the heart and mind of a little four-year-old boy who isn't old enough to protect himself. He depend son people like you, to keep him safe and happy.\n\nAll you did was tell the truth. If your mother knew her actions were bad, if she knew how others would respond to knowing her behavior, why did she do it? How long did she think should would get away with abusing that baby? \n\nYou did the right thing. You listened to your heart and your conscious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
