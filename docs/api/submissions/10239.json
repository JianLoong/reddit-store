I (31M) borrowed it the other day and unfortunately got into an accident and the car is totaled. She is now borrowing my car until we sort this out.\n\nUnfortunately she did not get an insurance plan that offers new car replacement and the insurance will only pay her what her car after 2.5 years of use is worth. It is a fairly rare car in our area and there are no equivalent cars of that age for sale on the used market, and what her insurance values the car at can only get her a 5-6 year old similar but not equivalent car. She has tried many avenues to appeal with them but they will not budge.\n\nShe now wants to buy the same car but brand new and for me to put in the extra cost difference. While I can afford it, I do not feel like I am responsible for it as I am not her insurance even though I caused the accident. I have already agreed to pay the deductible. It would be a fairly big amount for someone I have only been dating for 2.5 years now even though I do feel bad for her. I feel she should get a different new non luxury car or buy an older luxury car instead.\n\nAITA here for not picking up the deficiencies in her insurance policy.\n\nEDIT: Where I live insurance is on the car and typically your insurance does not cover other cars you drive. \n\nAlso I guess I am TA, I will pay her the difference for a new car even though legally I / her insurance are just liable for a 2.5 years old one, I get why she wants a new car without previous owners as she likes cars.", "created_utc": 1676681464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1152n54/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_girlfriend_so_she/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dumbass.", "YTA - you owe her the replacement cost of the car - she or her insurance company can sue you for that amount and probably win - take her generous offer instead", "Man, I have some mixed feelings on this. I\u2019m an insurance adjuster, so I have to explain to people constantly that they are only owed the current value of their car. She had a 2.5 year old car, she might have bought it for, say, 50k. But now it\u2019s worth 40k. If someone is responsible for her car, they only owe the 40k. For example, if you were driving your car and ran into her car, you would owe the 40k. No exceptions. If she wants to buy another new car for another 50k, that\u2019s her decision. She had a car worth 40k, she\u2019s only owed 40k. In theory she should be able to find a car worth 40k to buy. Also note her car was a used car owned by a private party. If she insists on buying from a dealer, she\u2019s gonna pay more. It doesn\u2019t matter if her car was the only one in the area, it\u2019s worth what it\u2019s worth. \n\nAlso, a lot of people here don\u2019t seem to realize that when you loan someone your car, you loan them your insurance. Insurance follows the car primarily, so the owner\u2019s policy takes the hit. That\u2019s just the way it is. \n\nOn the other hand, you guys are in a relationship. You keep saying \u201conly 2.5 years\u201d like that\u2019s insignificant. Man, at 2.5 years my wife and I already shared a bank account, shared finances, and we\u2019re planning our life together. If I wrecked her car, I would be doing whatever I could to make her happy with a replacement. I\u2019m not a big fan of buying brand new cars of any kind, I think it\u2019s a shitty deal, they depreciate immediately, and you can get a much better deal on a lightly used car that\u2019s a year old or so. Certified used cars often come with even better warranties than new ones. So I\u2019m not a fan of her just demanding another brand new car. \n\nThat said, if she\u2019s your partner, you should be trying to make this right for her, beyond just the deductible. Paying the deductible is like the minimum I would expect. If you care about her happiness and a long term relationship, get your thinking cap on. You said there\u2019s no similar cars in your area. Have you looked elsewhere? This is an opportunity to show you care. Track down an exact replacement, even if it\u2019s in a different state. Make a romantic weekend of going and picking up her replacement car together. Put a big bow on it or something. Drive it home together. Turn this into a positive. Or if you\u2019ve got a ton of cash, just help her buy the new car. Consider it an investment in the relationship. \n\nAfter writing out my thoughts, I\u2019m going with a light YTA. Mostly because this is not just an acquaintance, this is a relationship. At least it seems like it. If you\u2019re not that into it, you could probably cut ties and walk. Some of these people saying she should sue you are wrong. She got the money her car is worth. You were a permissive driver under her insurance. She would have nothing to sue you for. But if you are into this girl and want to have a long term relationship, you need to figure out how to make both of you happy.", "YTA. You broke it, you replace it. She shouldn't even need to use her policy at all.", "YTA, and possibly legally on the hook.", "YTA & she needs to replace you", "INFO: do you have a separate policy that covers you when you drive other vehicles, given that you have a vehicle of your own?", "YTA.

Your girlfriend shouldn't get screwed over for your mistake.", "My mind wasn't entirely sure until I read \" **only** been dating for **2.5 years**\". Your gf loaned you her luxury car which you totalled. Her insurance won't be enough for her to replace the car with something similar, so she asked you to contribute to helping her get back a similar vehicle, and you freely admit you can afford it do this, but won't because \"it would be a fairly big amount for someone I have only been dating for 2.5 years.\" OP YTA big-time!!!

You either pay for a new car or you pay the difference in what insurance will pay and the new car price .", "YTA - pay for the difference", "YTA.  But this one is tough.  The bottom line is that your girl wants to drive a fairly new LUXURY car...and that is a valid choice.  The only reason she can't do it is because you destroyed the luxury car that she was driving.  So it's up to you to make sure she's driving a luxury car again.  Now, the only way she can do that is to upgrade to a newer model.  You should not be on the hook for the upgrade.  But that doesn't mean you owe nothing.  You need to accept responsibility that your girl is in the position of having to buy a new car BECAUSE of your actions.  I say YTA as you clearly state you don't want to spend money on this, as it's only a girl you have been dating a while.  \n\nBest compromise?  I think the only logical course of action is for you and your girlfriend to split the cost (beyond what insurance will pay) exactly 50/50.

I (31M) borrowed it the other day and unfortunately got into an accident and the car is totaled. She is now borrowing my car until we sort this out.\n\nUnfortunately she did not get an insurance plan that offers new car replacement and the insurance will only pay her what her car after 2.5 years of use is worth. It is a fairly rare car in our area and there are no equivalent cars of that age for sale on the used market, and what her insurance values the car at can only get her a 5-6 year old similar but not equivalent car. She has tried many avenues to appeal with them but they will not budge.\n\nShe now wants to buy the same car but brand new and for me to put in the extra cost difference. While I can afford it, I do not feel like I am responsible for it as I am not her insurance even though I caused the accident. I have already agreed to pay the deductible. It would be a fairly big amount for someone I have only been dating for 2.5 years now even though I do feel bad for her. I feel she should get a different new non luxury car or buy an older luxury car instead.\n\nAITA here for not picking up the deficiencies in her insurance policy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
