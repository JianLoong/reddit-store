Tell him you'll mow it once he signs it over to you.  What are the adverse possession laws like in your state?", "NTA. Does he know his own property line? His grass, his problem. The grass may, or may not be greener on the other side, but definately taller.. maybe next time you should ask him if he's trying to grow his own privacy fence in that spot.", "NTA \n\nIf this is the hill you want to die on go for it. I'd just mow the damn patch", "NTA. You don't have to mow his lawn. It sounds like he doesn't think it is part of his property. So you could explain that. He sounds like a bit of a condescending jerk so I wouldn't do him any favours", "NTA\n\nBut it seems like your neighbour is trying to give you some of his land,  or maybe he is right and it's already your land", "The second he says \u201cyou missed a spot there\u201d would be the last second I ever thought about helping him out! \n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\"You missed a spot there,\" should easily be countered with \"Actually, that spot is of your yard,\" and shut the door.  \nHowever, I would ask to consider if this would be your \"hill to die on\" moment. If not, then maybe occasionally knock it down wouldn't hurt, or just continue to ignore it. If it is, then get a hold of a surveyor and have them mark explicitly where the property line is so the neighbor knows where is responsibility is and where yours ends. Either way, I would be sure to refrain from talking with your neighbor in this matter anymore, less you wish to start getting into a \"my grass is bigger than yours\" match.", "ESH. Use your words, don't expect people to read your mind. Since you mowed it for some time, you created an expectation that you would continue to do so. And are you really sure that the fence *is* the property line?\n\nI used to think that. And I thought that one of my neighbors kept doing things on \"my\" property. But then they put the house on the market and had the property surveyed... And I talked to my father (I live in the house I grew up in). It turns out that, where we live, when you put up a fence, it must be at least six inches inside your property line. And the fence was installed by, and within the property of, the previous owner. It makes it a little hard to judge exactly how wide my front yard is. On the bright side, my back yard is enclosed by fencing installed by the three adjoining neighbors, so it is at least a foot wider and six inches longer than what I actually own. I could require them to maintain the property on my side of the fence, but I just appreciate the free fence and extra space.", "YTA you said yourself your not even sure if he knows it\u2019s his property", "INFO: did you tell him it's his property?", "Depending on just how shitty the neighbor is, I'm just saying that most city governments will impose fines on homeowners who don't keep their lawns trimmed....", "He has to know. He's not stupid. The grass patch in question is a rectangle, with our fenceline halfway along the longside if that makes sense????? It's hard to explain without a picture but it's pretty darn obvious.", "I would happily take the land hahaha. But it is clearly his land, I know that for sure. It was probably overkill but I've just looked at the blueprints for my property (we had it built ourselves, hence the blueprints) and can confirm it is indeed his property. \n\nAlthough anyone with eyes can see that it is on his side of the fence lol.", "This was a boring read.", "What they said", "It wasn't written to entertain you bud", "Talk to.him about that being his property in case he really doesn't know. You are just assuming he knows because he's not stupid. But, it's not your responsibility to mow. So, NTA for not mowing.

Like talked about where the property line is and about the mowing? Because it sounds like he probably doesn't think that's his property. \n\nWhen I moved in to my current house, none of the neighbors knew where the property lines were. I needed to know to build a fence, so I hired a surveyor.\n\nOne line specifically was far off from where the neighbors had all been mowing. Trees had been planted that sat right atop the property line.\n\nPeople don't always know where property lines are.", "Is this really worth having an argument over? Just mow it and move on with your life."]}
