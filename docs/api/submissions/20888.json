Last week I encountered a middle aged woman, around 50 years old as I was coming off a trail. She was walking in my direction as I came out of the bush. It was strange to see her, the sun was almost down and the weather was starting to turn. also, this was an intermediate collection of trails at best, difficult even for me at worst. and she didn't look super athletic. Point is, my 'weird' radar was going off already.\n\nShe walked up to me and stopped, standing too close for my comfort, gestured toward the clearing where my car was parked, and asked whether it was my car. No greeting or anything. When I looked over something made me uncomfortable- there were no cars other than mine in sight. The trail I was on isn't crazy far from civilization but it's not a walk away- one of those highway rest stops that's there for the trail and a few parking spots. no way she could have got there without driving.\n\nI let her know that, yes, it was my car, to which she responded something like \"Perfect, there's a storm coming, I can't be caught in it and I need to get home\". She was very matter of fact. It seemed like she had already decided what would happen. without waiting for my response, she started striding for my car. I am glad I always lock my doors because she would have hopped right in the passenger seat had the door opened.\n\nAs she was walking over to it, I went after her trying to explain that I wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to hitch a ride- asking why she was out here in the first place. I was talking to a brick wall until she realised the car was locked, at which point she turned around with this look of anger and frustration on her face. She starts ranting- the same stuff as before \"I NEED to get home\" \"A STORM is coming\" \"I CANNOT be caught in it\" \"Why don't you get it?!\". I was very confused at this point, and a little scared, as this woman was now a barrier between me and my vehicle. I told her something like 'I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable with having a stranger in my car'.\n\nShe stared me down for a few seconds, I guess trying to gauge her chances at asking again. And just like that, the anger drops from her face and she\u2019s silent. I was really uncomfortable. I asked if I could call someone, if there was another way to help. she starts walking- towards me (scary), but then right past me. I'm still asking her questions, then just saying things like \"hello\" and \"excuse me\". no response. She walked to the other end of the rest stop and maintained eye contact with me as she sat down on a log, then just stared at nothing.\n\nI didn\u2019t follow her. I got into my car really shaken up and drove away. As soon as I was back in cell range I called fire and rescue, they said they would send someone out. I was scared for my safety in the moment, but she was just some woman alone in the middle of nowhere.

I learned so much from reading it!", "yes! but it was nothing major, light rain and a fair wind.", "True, I didn't think about that", "I felt as if I were reading the beginning of a horror story for a minute there. NTA at all. It's great that you called fire and rescue. Stay safe out there :)", "NTA. Sounds like she may have been unwell but I don't think I would have felt comfortable inviting her into my vehicle either in the circumstances. You did the right thing by calling fire and rescue - let the professionals deal with the situation unless someone requires immediate first aid.\n\nLast year my spouse and I were hiking at a bird sanctuary and we kept seeing an elderly man who had arrived by bike. He had no water with him and it was during an extreme heat wave. He kept coming up to us and asking if we knew where the birds were. He just seemed a bit off. So we walked back to the interpretive center and told the staff what we'd observed. They sent someone out to look for him on the trail to see if he was OK.", "Nta. Honestly I'd be worried she was a bait person for trafficking or that she was trying to steal your car.", "Info: did she offer you a rose in exchange for shelter? Did you turn into a beast when you said no?", "A lot of cultures have stories about \"a spirit of the road\" they go by different names in different places. 1 thing that is common in a lot of them is the spirit will ask for a ride and this is where the stories split in some if you help the spirit you get rewarded (normally grants a wish or something like that) but in others helping the spirit will result in being dragged to the afterlife. Now whether you believe in that stuff or not is besides the point your story had enough similarities that even a sceptic might hesitate a little bit. NTA for all you know that was an evil spirit and could have sucked out your soul..... Or it could have really just been an old lady that got stranded somehow and needed a lift either way I still say NTA you're not obligated to give a ride to anyone for any reason", "NTA - you acted wisely, and held your ground even though you were unnerved. You even took the extra step to make sure emergency services could help her. \n\nWell done, OP.", "NTA\n\nThis is giving strange X-Files vibes.\n\nHow did this woman get in the  middle of nowhere? \n\nDid someone drive her there and leave her?\n\nIs she an alien?", "NTA. You did not feel safe. That's enough. You did right by calling for help when possible. Your safety comes first.", "Was she even alive?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Best case senario - she got woefully lost, was anxious, and saw you as a lifesaver.  She was too upset to realize how she was presenting to others and came across as a weirdo.  Worst case senario - she is a crazy weirdo or part of a group of people with bad intentions.  Asking if you could call for help while not letting her in your car was the right move.", "NTA. I occasionally pick up hitchhikers or people with broken down cars because I live in a mountainous area where there are long stretches of road with no cell reception. But I gauge situations carefully. This sends up so many red flags, I absolutely wouldn't let that woman in my car. And you were kind enough to call help for her, in case it really was an emergency. You did the right thing here.", "NTA this is feels like some sort of setup.", "NTA, but you're probably cursed now.\nShe was definitely a ghost or witch.", "NTA. It is very likely she was harmless, but you did the right thing.", "NTA\nthis had to either be a ghost or you were gonna get a mini-documentary on Dateline.", "NTA !!\n\n\nThis story kinda spooked the \ud83d\udca9 outta me. No one owes a complete stranger a ride home, ESPECIALLY under those circumstances. \n\n\nYou did the absolute best thing you could've done by calling authorities and let them know, so kudos to you! \ud83d\udc95", "NTA, given her behavior, it's better to let the professionals do it. You did the right thing.", "NTA She sounded lije she was having a mental health crisis. I had an aunt who was schizophrenic and would sometimes act/talk like that. You did the right thing by calling to get help for her.", "NTA\n\nFor all you know, there were others hiding in the brush and waiting to ambush you.  \n\nEven if it was just her, you have no idea what SHE was capable of!  \n\nYou did exactly what any rational person should have done--you got out of there and called to alert the authorities to someone who may need assistance.", "NTA\n\nShe was way too aggressive. Calling fire and rescue was the right thing to do. She could've tried to hurt you.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like the intro to a true crime documentary.\n\nAlthough I have found myself in a sort of similar position, except I was the strange person.\n\nI was caught in a really bad hail storm at the very top of Yellowstone mountains on a motorcycle. It got too dangerous to keep riding so I had to stop and I was trying to shelter myself under a large tree. \n\nA couple in a car eventually made their way to the top of the mountain. They saw me and I asked them for shelter. They gladly opened up their hatchback and we all sat in their car together to wait out the storm. They were super nice and we even knew some mutual people, even though I'm from Minnesota and they were from Texas. Pretty cool interaction honestly.\n\nBut I would not have blamed them if they turned me down for shelter. It is scary being approached by strangers like that. Although I'm a petite woman in my 20's and probably am not that intimidating lol.", "NTA. She was a forest witch and was going to steal your soul.", "NTA\n\nThe whole thing sounds super weird. A hiker doesn't just find themselves in the middle of the outback without their own transport. My first thought would have been, \"where is her vehicle?\"", "NTA\n\nVery NTA", "No way you are NTA - this sounds all kinds of sketchy and I wouldn\u2019t have let her in my car and would\u2019ve been freaked out too.", "NTA.  Sounds like you narrowly avoided being taken by a demonic entity!", "Definitely NTA.\n\nStatistically I'm sure you were fine, but the stats are meaningless when some mentally off person is in your car trying to accost you or attack you, and you never know.\n\nOf course I think it's also the case ironically that most serial killers come off as incredibly normal and even pleasant/charming so that's also not the best gauge...\n\nStill, nobody can blame you for being weirded out and not giving a ride to a stranger in the middle of nowhere.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re a prince, because that\u2019s how you get yourself and your whole castle and staff enchanted.", "No! She wasn't just an older woman, she was an older woman who was behaving *extremely* oddly. You didn't abandon her to the storm, you called emergency services. NTA.", "She really sounds to me like an alien trying to do a social experiment.", "NTA \n\nMy thoughts given her bizarre behavior was that she was bait for an ambush, she was trying to get away from captors, she had malicious intent, or she's developmentally not a fully cogent adult.", "Always trust your intuition. Well done. You did all the right things.", "NTA. You did the right thing by calling Fire and Rescue. Don't ignore your instincts especially when the behavior is odd.", "Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Young or old, frail looking or not, you never know what someone is capable of. Especially a complete stranger. If your instincts are warning you something is off, always listen to them. It could be she had dementia or something, in which case calling fire and rescue was a kind thing to do, but for all you know she could have been mentally unstable and carrying a knife or something which she may have used on you while you were distracted driving. A bit of an extreme scenario, but it's never really worth the risk when your instincts are screaming at you that it's unsafe.", "Anyone else wonder if she was actually a corporeal being?\n\nI think that, when your intuition radar goes off like that, you have to listen to it.  Calling for help was the clincher - NTA", "Nta\n\nHow\u2019d she get out there in the first place?? Use that to get back home", "NTA-- depending on your beliefs.. it could have been a skin walker", "Dude I think you just met an alien. NTA", "Better be a jerk that is alive than a polite person that is dead.\nNTA.", "NTA. Could have been bait for an abduction - put you in a situation you can't easily say no to. She was the only other person there and just happened to be waiting for you to return? I'd be freaked.\n\nCalling for help was the appropriate and safe thing to do. Your sense of fear is a gift from generations of ancestors who survived. Listen to it.", "r/creepyencounters", "For a second I thought I was on r/nosleep", "NTA Your gut/body/brain was telling you \"Danger!\" and you listened. That is never wrong. It was nice of you to call afterwards, let that be all the reassurance you need. If she was still there they helped her in whatever way she needed.", "NTA. She was very clearly a ghost.", "NTA. Your spider senses were tingling, you listened & got proper authorities involved to still help where you could.", "NTA.  \n\nIf she were elderly and not middle aged, I would guess dementia.  But that entire encounter is just weird", "NTA. You did the right thing and trusted your gut. And you called emergency services. If she truly needed help, she would have received it from them. Reading this all my alarm bells were going off.", "Nevermind the question of how she got there in the first place if she didn't have a car--clearly she was up to something. Absolutely NTA", "NTA. It's so important for women to pay attention to those feelings and not be shamed into ignoring them. You called the people who can help her. Listen to your instincts in potentially dangerous situations like that!", "NTA - I think you did the best thing in the situation.\n\nYou prioritised your safety firstly and then altered authorities to make sure that odd lady was ok. \n\nI feel like I would have done the same thing. Sounds really scary to be honest, I would have been crapping myself.", "NTA at all. Put it very simply, if it had been a 50 year old bloke acting like that, there's no way you'd have let him in. Not a soul would have said AH and you'd likely never have thought about it again.\nI'm a 27M (I presume more combat capable than yourself) and there is no way anyone demands their way into my vehicle, storm or otherwise. A bit of water isn't going to do them any harm, and if they're entitled enough to think they can demand it I will teach them a lesson.\nIf they ask nicely they are far more likely to get what they want, but from your description of events my mind would have been made up very quickly.\nYou don't need to be a fighting age male to attack/threaten someone, or implement some kind of scam.", "Older woman lol she was 50", "Girl, you probably just dodged a serial killer. \ud83d\ude05", "Was today's writing prompt about being in the woods?  This is the third post I've come across.", "NTA. Poor planning on her part does not constitute an emergency on your part.", "OP swerved a serial killer \u2620\ufe0f NTA, have you called back the rangers to see how she was?", "Absolutely NTA for keeping yourself safe. When you get that creepy feeling respect it and act accordingly.

That\u2019s honestly minor in comparison to your safety. I hope you have given yourself a huge pat on the back for knowing what to do.

Stay focused guys. If she can't get caught in a storm then she should have thought about that before heading out.
