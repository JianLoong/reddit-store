I really, REALLY recommend marriage counseling here, to give you and your husband a safe, mediated space to discuss your expectations, to see if there's room to work here (i.e. does you husband WANT his relationship with his mom to change?) and to give your husband coping tools to deal with his mom that he probably has never had a chance to learn.

Or limit her special wants and just let her have the bare minimum. Say she wants tv/cable - cancel it. Anything that\u2019s a luxury should be taken. Give her the cheapest phone plan with no internet or barely any data. \n\nDo you guys have kids or is this something that\u2019s stopping you guys from having kids?

Then when the amount you give her is one more affordable for you and hubby keep sending her that amount. I mean it\u2019s not like you want her to starve or die.

I wouldn\u2019t want my mom in this situation either. But assistance programs exist to help people like her so that you can HELP, not be dragged down by her.

She can live somewhere more affordable or pay her own rent. She can apply for food stamps or you can bring over her groceries for her.

It would be one thing if she was physically unable to work or support herself, but it sounds like she just quit her job because she was tired of working. I work at a trucking company and we have drivers working well into their 80\u2019s because they are able to and can\u2019t afford to retire! It sucks to have to work when you\u2019re old, but you gotta do what you gotta do and can\u2019t just expect someone else to take are of you. \n\nHusband isn\u2019t the AH either, though. It\u2019s hard to say no to your mother, especially if they have emotionally manipulated you into thinking you owe them just because they are your parent. \n\nHonestly, you need to decide for yourself if this is actually going to be a deal breaker for you or not. If you can\u2019t take it any longer and he\u2019s not willing to change then maybe try splitting up your finances more so that you have the freedom to do what you want with your own earned money.

There is also the dependency issue. If your husband is supporting her, he should be eligible for tax credits for her support. Another issue is that this may be her silent resentment for he getting married. Nothing personal to you, but since she probably raised him, she may feel that she's the only female figure he needs in her life. I'm guessing the sit down, poor pity me strike started shortly after your marriage. Stick to your marriage with your husband.

He already supported her and clearly feels it\u2019s his job to do so as much as required. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll change that mindset for him, and even if you do, unless he intends to cut his mother out of his life or lay serious boundaries, she will resent you forever for it and he may too.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to find yourself in a position where he cuts her off financially but hates you for it, and her too. It will end your marriage in the long run even if you achieved the initial result you were looking for.\n\nI would recommend couples counseling.
