I really, REALLY recommend marriage counseling here, to give you and your husband a safe, mediated space to discuss your expectations, to see if there's room to work here (i.e. does you husband WANT his relationship with his mom to change?) and to give your husband coping tools to deal with his mom that he probably has never had a chance to learn.

Or limit her special wants and just let her have the bare minimum. Say she wants tv/cable - cancel it. Anything that\u2019s a luxury should be taken. Give her the cheapest phone plan with no internet or barely any data. \n\nDo you guys have kids or is this something that\u2019s stopping you guys from having kids?

She might be doing that, or she could just be taking advantage of your husband's generosity.\n\nWhen you talk to your husband, which I think you should - you shouldn't talk about what you think his mom will do, or those effects.

Then when the amount you give her is one more affordable for you and hubby keep sending her that amount. I mean it\u2019s not like you want her to starve or die.

I wouldn\u2019t want my mom in this situation either. But assistance programs exist to help people like her so that you can HELP, not be dragged down by her.

She can live somewhere more affordable or pay her own rent. She can apply for food stamps or you can bring over her groceries for her.

It would be one thing if she was physically unable to work or support herself, but it sounds like she just quit her job because she was tired of working. I work at a trucking company and we have drivers working well into their 80\u2019s because they are able to and can\u2019t afford to retire! It sucks to have to work when you\u2019re old, but you gotta do what you gotta do and can\u2019t just expect someone else to take are of you. \n\nHusband isn\u2019t the AH either, though. It\u2019s hard to say no to your mother, especially if they have emotionally manipulated you into thinking you owe them just because they are your parent. \n\nHonestly, you need to decide for yourself if this is actually going to be a deal breaker for you or not. If you can\u2019t take it any longer and he\u2019s not willing to change then maybe try splitting up your finances more so that you have the freedom to do what you want with your own earned money.

He doesn\u2019t necessarily need to completely cut her off, it\u2019s his mom he loves her I get it, but I would give her conditions like have to at minimum work part time to support some things herself. This is too much.", "Sure they can", ">She may live 40 more years.\n\nWith someone else supporting her every need, she will either live to 100 years old or rapidly decline when one small barrier crosses her path. I.e. she'll twist an ankle, refuse to be as mobile as she should, gain weight from lack of activity , and eventually succumb to a cardiac event, diabetes or stroke because son couldn't get up and walk for her.", "Whenever we try to talk about it, She starts to lecture. my husband that she sacrificed her life as a single mother raising him and now its his responsibility to TC of her and if he tries to kick her out she might die alone. My husband literally gets scared of her.", "I think this is my read on it as well. I don't see him changing now all of a sudden.", "Ultimatums like this often backfire. You don't start out with a divorce threat.", "Divorce him? I mean he is willing to set boundaries with his mom, He tried many times but MIL is adamant and start her dramas every time that she wont be able to make it on her own, she will die alone bla bla, and my husband cant action when she says this much.", "She got divorced when my husband was a school kid, She never let him see his father after the divorce.", "Umm read OPs edit, no she did not.", "And even if she didn't and something changed since they married. Some people do think it's their responsibility to support their parent, and while that's something everyone should talk about pre-marriage, the second best time is now. If he feels he can't at least (greatly) decrease the mommy fund, that just means they're incompatible now and need to separate.", "How does OP suck in this case? This doesn\u2019t seem like buyer beware. Circumstances changed after she signed the marriage certificate.", "Yes I also work in same firm as my husband. We actually met at workplace.", "This is an important part for judgement.", "Mom would be leaving herself destitute.  At 50, she is responsible for herself.", "To be fair, OP shouldn't have to work so that her MIL can continue to take advantage of them. The woman is 50, not 70.", "OP answered.. yes she works. She and her husband work in the same firm and met there.", "Refusing to work for your 50 year old mother who is in perfect health is not \u201cputting her on street\u201d she\u2019s putting herself there. Expecting your children to pay for your survival at 50 is nothing below nuts", "Hey everyone we found the MIL", "And OMG. don't EVER let her move in. She will never leave.", "9 years younger than me!  And I am full-time with three teens!  But this is never going to end I'm sorry to say.  OP - NTA - but this is the life you will always have.  Unless you leave.", ">She\u2019s 50!? Unless she has a serious medical condition there\u2019s no reason to retire and 50 \n\nI thought it was the dream to retire young to enjoy life if you can support yourself? My parents have retired/will retire young, and I hope I'm fortunate enough to do the same in the future. Work to live, not live to work is my philosophy \ud83e\udee1", "I feel bad for you because I lived this exact situation. We were engaged and not married yet and I had to push him to actually set a boundary and call her bluff. At the time we had not combined our finances and I told him that before we did, I would need him to be not supporting an entire other household otherwise my money would be paying our bills and his money would be supporting her. I told him that I was not willing to set a date for the wedding until he was able to financially contribute equally to our household (we worked at the same place and made roughly the same amount of money). Fortunately she was bluffing and ended up getting a job and doing just fine. We gave her 6 months to figure things out before he stopped paying all of her bills. He still helped out occasionally when it was really needed but she ended up doing just fine despite her threats to be homeless and destitute without him supporting her.", "She chose to have a child and it was her responsibility to raise that child. She's not old enough yet to expect to be \"taken care of\". She sounds very manipulative and that's emotional abuse towards your husband. He needs to be strong and put his foot down. You stand right by him and back him up. I suggest seeing if you can get some counseling/support because this sounds extremely difficult.", "ugh, I hate when parents say things like \"I sacrificed my life for you\"....no, you made the choice to have him, he didn't ask to be born. Her job was to support her child, no matter what and without expectation of anything. He owes her nothing.", "I'm sorry to say this, but in a lit of cultures it is absolutely mandatory for children to take care of their parents once they retire, no matter their age. And practically no child who grew up in that environment can set boundaries without suffering serious psychological consequences \nYour husband may set boundaries and stop supporting his mom for the sake of your marriage, but your marriage will not survive the backlash of that guilt", "He never asked to be born, it was her choice to have a child. What a guilt trip", "You don't make the ultimatum unless you are ready to follow through.", "Yeah, but have you another idea?", "First sentence... \"he is willing to set boundaries\"\n\nNext sentence... \"He's tried many times\"\n\nOne of these two sentences is either completely untrue, or misleading. If he has to do it more than once, then you need to update that to \"he is willing TO SAY he will set boundaries\".\n\nEyes open please.", "He can, he just doesn't prioritize you. Do you want to be the second woman in his life forever?", "I wouldn't go so far as to threaten divorce. That's drastic and honestly NO ONE likes an ultimatum.", "Except he's actually not willing to set boundaries.  NTA. Hubby needs to lay down the law.  Mom is 50, not 80; she can find a job or apply for public assistance.", "You live with it or get a divorce because your husband isn't going to change anything.", ">He never saw his father?  So she's a rotten person as well as being manipulative.", "It's one thing to support an elderly or sick/disabled parent, but at 50 she should be working FT.  I'm 57 and can't imagine expecting anyone to give me money.", "I kind of get from where you coming from. And unless there's a serious medical reason preventing your MIL from working she should. I don't know if an ultimatum will get the effect you're hoping for and I also understand your husband not wanting his mother homeless, but he needs to work on his boundaries.\n\nNTA.", "I wasn\u2019t commenting on whether she \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d have to work (that is between her and her husband and whatever they agree on and what works for them), at the time of my comment she has replied to other questions but not that one! I see OP has replied now", "you highkey missed the most crucial part of that statement:\n\n> \u2026there\u2019s no reason to retire and 50 **and make your son who is trying to have his own life take care of you**\n\nif you can afford to retire at 50 then more power to you, but she clearly cant", "But this MIL didn't do that, and now she expects her son and DIL to work so she can live. Not okay.", "Yeah, but MIL can't afford to retire young if she's expecting her son to pay for everything.", "So glad she gave in, these situations have got to be difficult. These are just lazy MILs and kudos to you for sticking up for yourself from the beginning.", "I'm pretty sure that OP's MIL will do the same if her son pushes her. She will not be homeless and she will definitely not die. She uses those words because she knows it works, she doesn't mean it. NTA", "exactly! ultimatums are for when you have really and truly tried everything else and you're ready to walk away. it's your last ditch effort to save your relationship. these ppl on reddit are so quick to tell someone to divorce a person or threaten divorce without even trying anything else. in addition to that counseling is always the option before divorce threats.", "Yes, start with, \"This situation is a serious problem for me and us as a couple. We need to work together to get out of this because it's driving a wedge between us and I don't want that to happen. I have to set a boundary here, your mother needs to support herself.\"", "The problem is that OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t understand what a boundary really is. It\u2019s not about making other people change, it\u2019s about what you will do if they don\u2019t change. \nHe is not actually setting and holding to any boundaries with his mother. \n\nNTA - your husband is being emotionally manipulated by his mother. This will not get better until he gets therapy and decides to change.", "I agree! My mom is 60 and completely independent. My MIL, while considerably more emotionally needy, also works and supports herself with only a small help from hubby. I can't even imagine OP's situation.\n\nBut IMO, the husband's not an AH here - spineless, but not an AH. And while OP can try to help him set better boundaries, at the end of the day, she can only decide her own situation. So If he feels he needs to continue fully supporting his mom, she needs to evaluate if thtey're still compatible and if it's worth it to stay.", "Took it off before posting, but I did initially have the disclaimer that my comment wasn't really related to the post. The comment just seemed not a fan about retiring young.", "Yes. Plus threatening divorce harms the relationship. You destroy feelings of trust and security when you do that, so it better truly be a situation where this is the absolutely last step. You've tried negotiation, counselling, all of that. Now it's either change or divorce. It's not a negotiation tactic.", "That's basically an ultimatum but said in super indirect language lol", "And he will say, \"She is 50 years old. Where can she get a job when women at her age can no longer work in an adult massage parlour?\" I can't throw her out in the street.\"\n\nUnfortunately, no matter how she words it, the end result will likely be the same. He could end up supporting his mother for another 50 years. OP will be bitter and resentful and eventually leave.", "it definitely is not an ultimatum. it's a \"we have a problem that needs to be addressed\". i didn't say a word about leaving the relationship.", "She can work as a cashier at Target and many oher places even if she has no skills", "I will be 49 years old in a few months and I work full-time. There's no reason why a 50 year massage therapist (no one said it was an adult massage place, you totally read into that) can't get a job. She's not 80!! Hell, she could work at a grocery store, anywhere.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Also, you have no idea what skills she may or may not have.", "What happens if Husband ignores the boundary? Wouldn't OP then leave the relationship?", "Of course she can - if she wants to. I am only saying that she has her son nicely wrapped around her fingers and doesn't want to work. This policy has worked out nicely for her for years.", "She referred to it as a massage parlour. To us here, that would imply an adult massage parlour or she would have said that his mother was a massage therapist. \n\nWould you say you worked at a massage parlour? Perhaps I was wrong. \n\nI agree, she is young enough to get a job in a grocery store or shop, but I get  the impression that she doesn't want to or she would have already. She doesn't feel the need when she has a son willing to support her.\n\n I don't predict a happy ending for OP but hope I am wrong about this.", "That's not my call, that's up to OP. I would insist on counseling if it was me.", "Where I am, a masseuse and a massage therapist are two different professions - but a masseuse is not a sex worker. They still work at a massage parlor, because that's what a place where you go to get non-therapeutic massages is called.  An \"adult\" massage parlor, however, would be where I would go to get taken care of by a sex worker who may or may not actually be also a trained masseuse.", "Massage parlour is just old school terminology, just like tattoo parlour. Now they're usually called Tattoo Shop, unless you're old school and then you call it a parlour. I still hear people use it interchangably, same for massage parlours. \n\nShe definitely could get a job in retail, at a restaurant, housekeeping, etc. Of course, she doesn't want to, but she should stop guilting OPs husband and manipulating him so that she can be lazy.\n\nI hope OP takes her husband to counseling so that they work through this together. He does need to learn to set some boundaries with his mother. I'm hoping for a happier ending too, but it's a really tough situation.", "A masseuse and a massage therapist are two different professions, both valid and not classified as 'adult.'", "yes, that's exactly correct. you explained it better than i did."]}
