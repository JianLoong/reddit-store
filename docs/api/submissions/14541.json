She was 13 months old and her mother had walked out of the maternity ward and left her there. I adopted her when she was 2.5. Our son, 'Ben' arrived 5 years later then a number of years later  we were contacted by social services and asked if we'd take custody of Ana's birth mothers child that was due in around 3 weeks. \nWe agreed then it was myself who spent weeks at the NICU whilst 'Cam' was weaned off drugs. She'd never met her mother and had very little interest in finding her. She knows we adopted her and she also knows she's always been loved and happy. \nWe've recently decided that after 27 years, we should probably get married as we're going to be grandparents later in the year. \nMost people thought it was funny that we'd never gotten around to it but MIL lost her mind! \nApparently she'd seen the birth mother begging a few months before. She's still in the depths of addiction but MIL decided to invite her to her home and let her stay there.

We hadn't felt forced. We were asked, had a chat, considered the possibilities if we didn't take her so she became our child.\n\nCam was being basically harassed by MIL about building a relationship with this woman. She's still at high school and asked if she was allowed to block both of them. I assured her that if she thought that's what she needed I'd support her. MIL has been banging at the door, driving past the house 30+ times a day and has told our other two kids that she only wanted what was best because 'she's the most precious one of all'. \n\nOther people in the family are trying to make me feel guilty about it and she's telling everybody that i forced Cam to block her. \nShould I be encouraging them to chat or just supporting my child?

Your MIL is definitely the a-hole. That's terrible. You should NEVER force a child to have a relationship with someone. Especially someone STILL having addiction problems. You did the right thing. That isnt how you handle the situation. Your MIL needs to kick rocks.", "NTA NTA NTA.  Cam deserves to live  a harassment free life.\n\nSounds like you might all need to go NC.  Maybe even go so far as to get a restraining order.  You need to keep your family safe and this woman wants to bring an addict around which is just not safe.\n\nNext time MIL bangs on the door, call the police.  I'd suggest investing in a video camera doorbell so that any interactions are recorded for evidence.", "nta but what is your husband doing about this???", "NTA Your child was ambushed by her grandmother and lost her trust. Now she's being harassed by her grandmother and bio mom. She does not want contact with either. You're supporting her on this decision. Everyone else with their opinions thinking they're in 'the know' can f-off.", "NTA! Please have your partner go over and speak to his mother and to his daughter's egg donor. Go along if you wish, but leave the kids out of it, obviously. Explain to them that while you've tried to handle this as adults, they don't seem to be interested in being adults. Explain that your job (and your partners) is to protect your children first and foremost, and this child is yours....legally and in all ways that matter.\n\nMake it very clear that any attempts to ambush your daughter again, any driving by and pounding on the door and any stalking behavior will result in a restraining order being filed against them. Draw a firm line and then stick to it. If they violate it, please follow through. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this but you are absolutely 100% right to protect your children.", "NTA. Sounds like harassment. Blocking these two women is a reasonable response.", "NTA - You are 100% in the right and you MIL needs a restraining order. Your daughter was old enough to establish her own boundaries and you respected her independence. Never feel ashamed for sticking up for your children.", "NTA, OP, continue to protect your daughter. I really can't imagine what is going through MIL's mind, but it makes no sense. MIL certainly doesn't have your daughter's or your families best interest in mind.  Bio-mom must be a very skillful manipulator.", "NTA I would call police if she shows up again. Set up a camera that records the drive us too. Also make sure school knows so MIL doesn\u2019t show up there.", "NTA\n\nAt this stage I would also get the social services involved. If BM was on drugs and continued to be an addict years after the child was taken away from her, then she's an active danger to your youngest daughter. Since the adoption was suggested by social services, contact them and let them know that the BM is harassing your child. \n\nI would also get your MIL evaluated for dementia. It's quite possible that she's operating with less than a full stack. It would be in everyone's interests that you get a proper psychiatric evaluation done for her and get her committed to a facility where they take care of cases like her.", "NTA-You are standing up for and supporting your daughter.

Is this normal behavior from her?\n\nAlso do all the things everyone else said to keep protecting your child. Go as far as posting the shit on Social media so the rest ofnthe family can see how bizarre this is. Don't just get the police involved. Get everyone so involved that they understand that this is not something your family wants and that they need to respect that. Family is quick to take sides with little or no information.", "NTA and call rhe cops on MIL she is stalking you and Cam", "NTA", "NTA!

She's parked outside now but across the street. I'm definitely getting a ring doorbell and contacting the police. I've already moved Cam into a rear bedroom so she can't be watched so I suspect MIL is just staring at her former bedroom window!", "He's normally fully supportive but is currently working in Bangladesh and due home in 3 weeks and counting!", "This.

Will she force your daughter to go with her to meet the BM?\n\nThis might sound dramatic, but your MIL'S behavior seems to be escalating, and no one knows how far she will go.

Holy moly.", "Nta. If you are in the USA, and baby girl was born addicted, the police will assist you in filing charges against the egg donor.  She should have gone to jail when baby girl was born, however you have until her 18th birthday in most states.  DO NOT and I mean DO NOT go over to your MIL if egg donor is staying with her!!! Not even to talk. Call husband and tell him to handle his mother. He has 12 hours and then your calling the cops. No if, ands, or buts. Protect your child.", "I think in light of that you may have to abandon that idea and leave her to the wolves until she's done with this stunt. But when you report her to the police make sure you mention that behavioral change. They won't do anything but it's on paper, so if something else happens it's not a \"new\" thing.", "Absolutely! OP, please take note! Especially about the school. Both egg donor AND grandma should be blocked from being able to pick your daughter up from school.", "Interesting idea.", "My daughter is very rarely alone. I drive her to school and my friend drives her back to hers then I collect her from there when I finish work. We're relatively rural so never been a fan of any of them wandering around alone.", "Yes. This is stalking and harassment. This is not acceptable and a police visit is overdue. NTA protect this child from these psychos.", "I've been worried about that for a while but she's been insistent that she doesn't need any investigations."]}
