You are simply supporting her in what is decidedly her decision. \n\nHowever, I think this is the least of your worries.  Given your MIL\u2019s behaviour, this looks like instead of dying down, it will likely escalate.  So I think you need to anticipate next moves and be prepared accordingly.  Put cameras all around your property and note her comings and goings. Speak to police about the situation to see what they can do, and also see if you can get a protection/restraining order. Tell the school what is happening and let them know that under no circumstances is your daughter to go with anybody else - she has only two legal guardians. Change the locks in your house if your MIL has keys. I would go so far as to arm your daughter with pepper spray or a whistle. And also, Bangladesh is NOT in the middle of nowhere - if your husband has not done it already, tell him to call his mother and insist she stop this nonsense; and to keep doing this on a daily basis if she does not let up.", "NTA You're protecting your children and honouring your daughter's wishes.

She owns her own home but that's about it. We're in a better position financially and we've never once asked for her help with anything. My parents set up a modest college fund for each of them but we subsidise that and Cam is only 15. Legally they'd all be entitled to a share as all three are legally our children. Ben is a huge linebacker sized guy and he and Cam are really close. He's coming to stay for a while so even now, with the bedroom move and the prospect of her big brother, Cam is in a happy place and she knows how much she's loved and that we'd die or kill to keep her safe.", "I've involved the police now. Bio mom is in trouble because she was told to not make any attempt to contact Cam until she was 21. MIL is in trouble for stalking, harassment and telling Bio mom what our daughters legal name is, what town we live in and what school she goes to. I can see we may be forced to move now but worth it to keep her safe.", "Honestly I've been discussing taking out a full page ad in the local paper. The only thing stopping me is Cam wanting it worded in such a way that nobody knows she was born addicted.", "Cops involved and Ana and Ben have told their dad what's going on. I'm surprised I didn't hear his bellow off rage all the way from Bangladesh!", "I did inform the police that we were becoming increasingly concerned about MIL.

That is your daughter and she has no obligation to appease her egg donor and frankly neither do you.\n\nKeep protecting your kids and loving them.

What is wrong with those grown women harassing a teenager that is clearly setting boundaries. Definitely would go no contact with your mil", "No, you should not be encouraging contact between your daughter and her stalker. Because your MIL is stalking and harassing her. This is disturbing. You should contact the police if she refuses to stop harassing her. And I wouldn't be surprised if the bio mother tries to get money from your daughter.

We're pretty rural so she's driven to and collected from school. The friend who collects her is married to the chief of police and I collect her from there. She got a large dog, a large daddy and an even larger big brother. Nobody will get near my child especially not her or bio mom.", "She's just a sweet sensitive soul and thought she'd need permission.

That makes sense.\n\nNTA.", "as someone who was almost a victim of this exact scenario (yes my grandmother too) definitely reinforce who can pick up your kids from school and after school activitie.

In fact you would totally be the A H if you failed to protect your child from your MIL. \nPlease, document everything and do not be afraid of taking legal steps to keep MIL and Bio away from your family. Inform all schools, childcare, churches - whoever and wherever your child spends time so that they cannot use any locations to stalk and harass your child. The leap straight to the ambush is hugely concerning. \nI'm so sorry that that has happened to your daughter. \nI just can't even.", "You should be encouraging your child to do what is best for her, which is exactly what you have done.

Get a restraining order of you need to, NTA.", "NTA - your girl and her mental health and wellbeing are the number one priority. Nobody has a right to access your daughter of be in her life, not even family like the MIL. If my daughter needed to cut my MIL out I'd run out and buy a pair of shears! You're doing the right thing.

I am so sorry Cam was put and being put through this and was able to find an incredible mama like you. Please contact the police and besides the cameras to record your MIL I would take pics on your phone, keep a journal for what time she's come by or if she's said anything. If she knocks on the door, record it so you have evidence, especially if she says anything scary. Get that restraining order as soon as you can.

Seriously what MIL is doing is harassment", "Omg! Please call the police! One thing I\u2019m struggling to understand. Why does MIL have such an interest in bio mom? Are they related somehow? Cam is your adopted daughter but has no biological relationship to anyone except her older sister, correct?  I\u2019m trying to put my puzzle pieces together.", "Please consider that your MIL might have gotten roped into the same substances as your daughter's bio mom due to the two of them living together. A sudden gear shift into literal stalking and obsessive behavior doesn't sound like a healthy or sober person's behaviors. \n\nNeither of those people are safe or trustworthy around your child, and the intensity of the harassment and contact attempts isn't just a red flag it's an active, present, danger to you and your family.", "First NTA. You guys might want to consider a full family name change, and full makeovers to make sure they can\u2019t find you. Like witness protection level stuff. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s super important not to engage the stalker at any stage. I read somewhere that if someone calls you 1,000 times and you answer, it just teaches them they need to call you 1,000 times for you to pick up.\n\nGood luck with everything. \ud83d\ude4f", "Not only that,  but mil saw her begging and still clearly abusing drugs and thought yep she needs to have a relationship with my granddaughter.

Besides MIL, who seems to be off her rocker to put it carefully, her entire family seems solid AF! NTA", "Back in the mid-90\u2019s, I suspected my dad had Alzheimer\u2019s.  My mom was the QUEEN of denial and flat-out refused to have their doctor look into it.  I wrote out a three page letter outlining my observations and concerns/questions, and dropped it off at their doctor\u2019s office the day before dad\u2019s next appointment.  I, of course, stated in it that I expected no information as I did not have POA (this was pre-HIPAA), but that I had concerns that I hoped the doctor would take into consideration.  \n\nHe diagnosed dad with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nMy mom was PISSED.  Not at me, but at the doctor for doing his damn JOB.  She never found out about the letter; the doctor played it off as his own concerns.  She was pissed that she could no longer deny that dad had a disease that was progressive in nature, that he would get worse as time went on, and that he was essentially terminal.  She didn\u2019t seem to comprehend that the diagnosis opened up resources for them both.  She just saw it as a HUGE inconvenience and a departure from her \u201cperfect life\u201d image (oh the stories I could tell, our lives were FAR from perfect).\n\nWrite a letter.  Provide factual observations of her increasingly erratic behavior and poor choices.  List concerns and questions.  Take your time with it - add things as you think of them or observe new things.  Read it over a couple of times before giving it to the doctor, make sure it\u2019s concise, factual, and not from a place of anger or emotion.  If you truly want her to have a chance at being helped, this is the way to go.  \n\nI\u2019d also get that restraining order in place though; she may choose to ignore it and you\u2019d have to deal out some legal consequences for her, but some people are scared off at the mere suggestion of an RO.  Document every action and interaction (for both the RO and the letter to the doctor).  Invest in a Ring doorbell and security cameras, and invest in the monthly service so you can save the videos.", "Excellent advice!"]}
