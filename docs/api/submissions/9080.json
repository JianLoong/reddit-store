Brianna\u2018s childhood best friend Morgan + her husband Cody hosts every game night. At the beginning of my and Brianna\u2018s relationship, I would go to these game nights on and off, but since Brianna and I have become more serious, she expects me to go with her every week. \n\nGame night is usually really enjoyable. The drinking, board games, and seeing how happy it makes Brianna are great, but I have an issue with how Morgan and Cody choose to feed their guests for game night. Morgan and Cody are vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free, so everything at game night is also vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free. \n\nEvery game night, Morgan sends everyone a Venmo request for how much it costs her to buy ingredients for dinner and all snacks and beverages, divided by how many people are attending that week. Typically it works out to be about $40 a person. This wouldn\u2019t bother me that much if it weren\u2019t for every time Brianna and I go to game night, we ALWAYS leave hungry and usually pick up takeout on the way home. \n\nBetween the 45-minute drive, $40 to attend the game night, and the extra $50 we usually spend on takeout, it\u2019s over $100 to go weekly. Personally, I would rather spend that hundred dollars on a nice dinner and not on a glorified salad and cheap takeout. \n\nMultiple times I\u2019ve tried to have a conversation with Cody about maybe Brianna and me hosting game night or maybe having some alternative food choice at game night, but  Morgan and Cody are \u201csuper vegans\u201d and won\u2019t allow any animal products inside their home, and it\u2019s too far for everyone to drive to mine and Brianna\u2018s house for game night. \n\nInitially, I was planning on going to game night with Brianna tonight, but Morgan sent a Venmo request of $112 for Brianna and me to go tonight. I asked Morgan if we could skip it tonight and maybe spend the money on a nice dinner for just the two of us, but Brianna said we had already committed to going, and Morgan had already spent the money and all this time on food. We ended up arguing about the politics of how important game night is, and after way too long arguing, I just threw my hands in the air and told her I would rather spend the money on a new game and not an expensive salad. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675479849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10t3bu9/aita_for_bailing_on_game_night_with_my_gf_her/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have GF tell her friends a reasonable amount the two of you will contribute towards snacks and drinks and the friends can buy what they want within that budget.

That's absolutely outrageous and I wouldn't want to go every week either.", "NTA and it sounds like game night is financing their car note", "NTA. They\u2019ve turned game night into a recurring charge for a subscription vegan meal service that you don\u2019t even like. This is an important tradition for your partner, and you seem to enjoy everything except the food and the extra expense it incurs\u2014so perhaps you just can eat at home before you go to game night and only pay for drinks.

When it comes to non-recurring, small events, a good host would not charge their guests. However, think of the majority of holiday dinners and special, annual get-togethers. People will either offer to help offset the hosts' costs with money or by bringing a dish.\n\nThis is true of any regular re-occuring event. Also, the more frequently an event occurs, the higher the chance of compulsory contributions.\n\nIt is especially common for DnD and boardgame nights since they occur so frequently. Especially since it is the host who already sank in a significant investment in entertainment (i.e. source books for TTRPGs and a variety of board games and their expansions)\n\nHowever, these friends are being absolutely ridiculous with these costs. Spending $40-$100 on snacks for one evening every week is too much. It is especially so if this also forces others to conform to a dietary restriction they don't practice in their every day life.\n\nOP, the best way to handle this is not to throw a tantrum to insult the tradition. Approach it pragmatically and reasonably. Ask Brianna how to best alter this arrangement to reduce the cost. Ask her to reach out to other attendees and see if others have a similar complaint. Work with everyone to find a general consensus for a compromise.
