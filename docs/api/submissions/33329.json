You saw her upset and crying from this moronic tool saying she was too big to lift.\n\nYou did the first thing that came to your mind to counter her embarrassment and disprove his jackassary.

If he can\u2019t lift his wife and he\u2019s set on getting in some stupid wife carrying contest with the dumbass dude bros at work then the solutions are a) lift more weights so he can carry her or b) don\u2019t be a Jackass and get involved in this in the first place. Clearly he can\u2019t manage  b so a it is. \n\nNTA- sounds like you and her have a pretty comfortable camaraderie (in one response you said she hugged you after) so I think it does sound like she was okay with it.\n\nWas your comment kind of A-hole ish? Yeah kinda but he was an A-hole first and a far bigger one to a totally innocent target so it\u2019s a warranted A-hole move.\n\nOn a side note I gotta know; how is you showing that you can lift her easily \u2018emasculating\u2019 but him whining that he can\u2019t life her not?", "Ah yes, that is a well-known giver of valid consent... another person entirely.", "are you implying that OP should have asked *her husband* for permission /consent instead of the wife herself?? or am I misunderstanding??", "pretty much this: if anybody picked up my wife like that, I would have decked him for sure.", "I mean you literally admitted in another comment you didnt ask her and hinted her lack of protest was an affirmative response.

With no nod from crying friend wife, no \u201cYou show my husband it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d no reaching out to climb him before he grabbed her.   That\u2019s frat boy predator reasoning.  He can do better.\n\nShe\u2019s not his girlfriend, his good friend, a teammate - somebody he\u2019s had a discussion about picking up before and a habit of doing so.  She\u2019s his friend\u2019s crying wife.\n\nAlso, those of us who have been manhandled like that have all too often had to reinforce that lesson loudly, often, and at length from a young age.\n\nAre you a guy?  Or a buff/tall woman?  Most guys and bigger women don\u2019t have to deal with being picked up or otherwise moved against their will very often.", "This wasn't a random crying woman, this was the wife of a close friend and he eliminated the reason she was crying by misproving it. \nI'm a woman, and honestly don't see a single reason why I should be upset about a friend of my husband picking me up."]}
