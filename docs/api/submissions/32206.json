I (27F) overheard my boyfriend (28M) of a little over a year telling one of his best friends that he would continue his tradition of going to her family\u2019s house for Christmas Eve dinner this year, and that I wouldn\u2019t be coming because it\u2019s the most important night for my family. My family does the Italian tradition of presents and the big meal (homemade manicottis) Christmas Eve, then we still celebrate on Christmas Day, just less and no presents.\n\nThe plan last year was for us to see my family on Christmas Eve and his family on Christmas Day. However, plans changed when I found out my family got covid. So we went to his mom\u2019s for her party and dinner Christmas Eve and then celebrated with his family in Christmas Day (went to his mom\u2019s house in the morning, stopped by my apartment for a couple hours, then went to have dinner with his dad\u2019s family). It was obviously not a great Christmas for me, and I had to sit awkwardly during multiple sessions of present opening and traditions I wasn\u2019t a part of (they did their best to include me but it was so last minute. I\u2019m thankful I could be with them but I missed my own family).\n\nI assumed that this year, the plan would be similar to what we originally intended last year, but apparently he expects to not see my family (send me to my parents\u2019 without him while he has dinner with his friend\u2019s parents) and then for me to go all around to his family\u2019s events on Christmas Day. He offered to come earlier in the day on Christmas Eve, but we don\u2019t do anything until dinner and after.\n\nSo I told him that if he doesn\u2019t come to my family\u2019s Christmas Eve, I\u2019ll stay with my family for Christmas Day too. I\u2019m not ditching my family for his when he can\u2019t ditch HIS FRIEND for mine. My plan would mean us spending more time with his family than mine and I thought it was a good compromise. If we didn\u2019t live together, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but I think we\u2019re at a stage in our relationship where we should spend Christmas together. So does that ultimatum make me an asshole?\n\nETA: I should say that we have had multiple conversations about this, and I\u2019ve explained how it makes me feel and offered to go to her event after we finish with my family. But he hasn\u2019t budged and I can\u2019t justify skipping a day with my family when he won\u2019t agree to see mine.

This is definitely a reason to break off the relationship, because if he or she isn't willing to get to know your family, then he or she will never want to do so.  Even if you two get married, eventually, you'll have to meet each other's family, and what's a better time than during holidays?!", "Op is currently breaking dishes", "NTA.\n\nBased on others\u2019 comments, are both your names on the lease or just one? If it is just one and not your name, make a game plan before pulling the trigger on the advised breakup so that you have a swift and safe exit without a forced homeless period (depending on where you live, he technically has to give a proper eviction with time but no need to force hostility). If it is one name and your name, check into the eviction process first where you live so you don\u2019t get accused of just booting him. If it is both your names, (1) see how long until the lease ends or (2) how much it will cost to break your part of the lease.", "This post made me angry and brought back memories. He is not making you a priority. Especially since he knows exactly how you feel. Go to your family for Christmas Eve and Christmas day, and then start making your exit plans. This is not the guy for you. Don't waste another minute with him. Especially if you want to get married and have kids, you need someone that puts you first, because he is not making you a priority now, he won't be 5 years from now. There will always be a friend who is more important.", "NTA. I\u2019d ask yourself if you\u2019re prepared to spend all your future Christmas Eves without him because he is having dinner at another woman\u2019s parents\u2019 house. What if you married and/or had kids? Would he still go there instead of with you? \n\nYou offered a solution that would allow him to participate in your family\u2019s traditions *and* see his friend and he flat out refused\u2026.he is telling you something about his priorities.", "NTA.", "NTA, throw the whole man away.", "How much of a tradition can it be if he spent last Christmas Eve somewhere other than his friend's house? Are you sure your boyfriend doesn't have two girlfriends...you and the girl he's going to spend this Christmas Eve with?", "Save the saleslips on anything you bought him,.... tell him if thats the way you feel then we're done and one of you has to move..... its a deal breaker", "NTA\u2026but will he even care? He\u2019ll prob just be like, ok cool. Doesn\u2019t sound like he prioritizes being around you during holidays.", "NTA this is such a red flag", "\"Part of the ship, part of the crew\" is the advice my stepmom gave me when my fiance and I first started dating and I had to go to his family reunion. I didn't want to go because I was nervous and his family can be judgmental, it ended up being fine. Your boyfriend is definitely not being part of the ship nor the crew, OP.", "NTA and so sorry, but the guy is not for you if he is not compromising at all. He is very selfish and sounds like they are more than best friends.", "NTA. The fact that he won't compromise and attend the party later after being with your family tells me that he prioritizes this friend's Christmas \"tradition\" over your family and he is willing to hurt you and damage your relationship to do it. If he did this to me, I would ALWAYS doubt our relationship. \n\nThe only other possible explanation is that he doesn't want to spend time with your family for some reason. Has spending time with them been an issue?", "NTA.  Your BF thinks it's more important for him to spend time with his \"friend\" and her family on Christmas eve than it is to be with you and your family.  Then even after you explain how that makes you feel he is not budging.  For some reason being with this friend and her family is more important to him than you (his GF), your family and your feelings.  He is showing you what his priorities are and you don't seem to be at the top of them.  Is this really how you want to be treated by someone you are in a relationship with?", "YNA but your boyfriend might be. Relationships are about give and take and your family are just as important as his. Why is his friend so important  that he puts them before you and your family? It\u2019s verging on disrespecting them. And you.", "Nta, but I smell something fishy here. Girl, I think you have bigger things to worry about.", "I suspect that you and your BF are at different places in the relationship. You're at the stage where you think of yourself as part of a couple that celebrates holidays together and finds ways to accommodate both of your families and seeks to please one another, and to be fair to each other.  \n\nHe's not.\n\nApparently you've discussed this ad nauseum, and he doesn't give a flying you know about how you feel, or about being with you and your family.  He wants what he wants, and you're not central to that.\n\nI would suggest that you back away sooner rather than later. This is not your partner. This is not a man who cares as much as you care, or who treats you as you deserve to be treated.  This is not a mature adult who adores you.  (I scrolled back up to see if maybe I misread and you were a couple of 19 year olds, which could kind of explain his behavior. But you're not.)\n\nI realize that red flags are not the seasonal red one wants to embrace, but look at this squarely and realistically.  You are not the woman he's dying to be with.  Dump his sorry ass.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I don't care if the Christmas Eve friend is just a friend or a friend with benefits. Your BF is being completely disrespectful of you with what he probably is going to call \"boundaries.\" If he doesn't want to be part of your family, but expects you to be part of his, then you don't have parity in the relationship.\n           \nFuture you is going to be a much happier person if you act on the fact that this relationship is over.", "this would be a deal breaker for me, tbh. like that is a huge thing to miss, especially given last year & how long yall have been together. it\u2019s sus.

After we adopted our youngest, we alternated his family, my family, stay home.", "ESH.\n\n>I assumed that this year,\n\nTo Assume is to make an ASS out of U and ME.\n\nI mean yeah, he should be prioritising you and your family over his best friend but assumptions like yours don't work and lead to disappointment and conflict.\n\nThat being said I consider going to my own families Christmas gathering to be a chore, going to another families Christmas gathering would be torture.\n\nI'm pretty up front about how I do 1 Christmas a year, Dad family or mom family, not both, I alternate because I will not run around to multiple different Christmas gatherings.", "!Updateme", "Info - how did he not go last year if this was such a tradition? If he\u2019d been consistent about it being a tradition, that would be different, but the fact it wasn\u2019t part of the routine last year makes it weird it\u2019s something he refuses to change this year.

This is a bigger deal than you think it is. This isn't just about Xmas Dinner. It's about his priorities, it's about him making room for you and your family in his life. He has placed you and your family at the bottom if the pile. He thinks this is OK because he is OK with spending Xmas eve apart, but he isn't seeing the hypocrisy in his position. \n\nIf he goes through with going to his friends, spend Xmas day with your family, you won't be in the right place to spend it with him and his and it could make it all very awkward. \n\nBUT do not trust him to apologise or explain on your behalf. Message his mum (or sister or whoever) and explain that you are taking a bit if space because he abandoned you for his friend on Xmas and you don't want to make the atmosphere tense by bringing your fight to their home on Xmas day, not to worry about you and to have a great time. \nIf you let him speak for you, who knows what he will say.\n\nDo you know/have you met this friend? Why didn't he go to dinner there last year if it is such an important tradition?", "I love Christmas Eve with my family and it's definitely a challenge each year to decide whether to do Christmas Eve with my in laws or Christmas Day. It wasn't so hard when they all lived in UT (I'm on the East Coast) but my parents and one of my sisters moved back out here (grew up here) this past year. It takes a lot of negotiation that we didn't have to worry about the first 8 or 9 years of our relationship- his family was here and my uber religious family was all an expensive and stressful flight(s) away. Now that some live here, we've negotiated with our families to make everyone as happy as possible- Christmas Eve with his family, but skipping the 10:00 church service they do to have time to ourselves after- our new tradition over the last few years has been to order takeout dinner, watch Die Hard while playing the Die Hard board game. Then Christmas Day my family will do a lot of the Christmas Eve traditions- amazing homemade Mexican food, singing carols around the piano, stockings and presents- we all were trying sincerely to work with each other to make all groups as happy as possible. Is there anything like that you can do?      ETA: I think everyone here is being a bit presumptive/assumptive of the \"friend\" issue, if his best friend is someone he's frequently spent the holiday with, maybe the friend/her family are like family to him- I have a friend who is practically a little sister that has joined my family for the holidays... I don't think, at a year, its a giant conspiracy to avoid her family or that he's super possessive- this is why we date before getting married, to work these things out over time.", "NTA. You need a different bf.", "So, to summarize: Your so-called SO can't come to your parents' Christmas Eve celebration because he has a date.\n\nNTA and you're probably better off single unless you want a sister wife", "NTA.\n\nand most likely she's not \"just a friend\"....", "NTA. You need to run. If he's already not prioritizing you and your family's, especially when you've requested it, it'll always be a battle.

This is a relationship of a little over a year, for all we know his friend's family's traditions have been part of his life for 28 years. He's not asking his gf to give up any important traditions for her, but timing means she might be able to go to some of his family stuff without missing any of her traditions. To go to her family's thing, he'd have to skip one of his.

My brothers also consider them family. So like if we lived closer it would absolutely be her family/my brothers and then my husband's family.
