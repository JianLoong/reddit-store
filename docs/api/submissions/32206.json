I (27F) overheard my boyfriend (28M) of a little over a year telling one of his best friends that he would continue his tradition of going to her family\u2019s house for Christmas Eve dinner this year, and that I wouldn\u2019t be coming because it\u2019s the most important night for my family. My family does the Italian tradition of presents and the big meal (homemade manicottis) Christmas Eve, then we still celebrate on Christmas Day, just less and no presents.\n\nThe plan last year was for us to see my family on Christmas Eve and his family on Christmas Day. However, plans changed when I found out my family got covid. So we went to his mom\u2019s for her party and dinner Christmas Eve and then celebrated with his family in Christmas Day (went to his mom\u2019s house in the morning, stopped by my apartment for a couple hours, then went to have dinner with his dad\u2019s family). It was obviously not a great Christmas for me, and I had to sit awkwardly during multiple sessions of present opening and traditions I wasn\u2019t a part of (they did their best to include me but it was so last minute. I\u2019m thankful I could be with them but I missed my own family).\n\nI assumed that this year, the plan would be similar to what we originally intended last year, but apparently he expects to not see my family (send me to my parents\u2019 without him while he has dinner with his friend\u2019s parents) and then for me to go all around to his family\u2019s events on Christmas Day. He offered to come earlier in the day on Christmas Eve, but we don\u2019t do anything until dinner and after.\n\nSo I told him that if he doesn\u2019t come to my family\u2019s Christmas Eve, I\u2019ll stay with my family for Christmas Day too. I\u2019m not ditching my family for his when he can\u2019t ditch HIS FRIEND for mine. My plan would mean us spending more time with his family than mine and I thought it was a good compromise. If we didn\u2019t live together, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but I think we\u2019re at a stage in our relationship where we should spend Christmas together. So does that ultimatum make me an asshole?\n\nETA: I should say that we have had multiple conversations about this, and I\u2019ve explained how it makes me feel and offered to go to her event after we finish with my family. But he hasn\u2019t budged and I can\u2019t justify skipping a day with my family when he won\u2019t agree to see mine.
