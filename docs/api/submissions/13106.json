No one wants to walk with someone who craps his pants often and has awful hygiene.  Most wedding I\u2019ve attended the groomsmen did really walk down the aisle\u2026just stood with the groom and just the bridesmaids walked the aisle.  But I\u2019d be a bit apprehensive about the fianc\u00e9 bowing down to his mom all the time.  What happens when she wants to name the grandkid, etc.  This just gets worse I\u2019d think.  This isn\u2019t a minor thing with the brother..he\u2019s gross and an adult and someone needs to take care of that\u2026like his parents. ESH but mostly fianc\u00e9 and MIL.", "But who cares if she does? Her adult son is creepy, doesn\u2019t bathe and shits himself at parties. Maybe this can be the wake up call they all need that this just isn\u2019t normal.", "So let her know.  You say \u201cyou were adamant Joel was in the wedding.  We are putting him in the wedding.  However, based on his behavior at the engagement party the bridesmaids don\u2019t want to walk with him.

I've had friends who associate with horrible people and because I'm the more reasonable one, I'm the one who has to deal with bad stuff because they don't want the stress from conflict with the others. But why should I get the stress instead!? \ud83e\udd72", "It depends on the reception. At some you sit with the person who walked you down the aisle and there may be a wedding party dance.  It may be more than a walk down the aisle.", "Unless he shits his pants like he did at their engagement party, or doesn't wipe his ass, per OP.", "Actually you have a point there: I\u2019ve only ever seen groomsmen walk the bridesmaids out of the ceremony, and that\u2019s a much faster, less formal walk where she wouldn\u2019t even need to touch his arm.

If I was Stacey I\u2019d be so close to being just quitting. If my friend doesn\u2019t care enough to ensure I feel safe and comfortable at an event that they\u2019re planning and in charge of (and I spent hundred of dollars on a dress and etc to be apart of), then they\u2019re obvious not a friend. Bye bye bride who is a trashcan.", "With people complaining about his hygiene, and him being a creep, I\u2019m gonna take a guess that MIL probally knows this will be the only time Joel will have a chance of walking down an aisle and therefore she\u2019s doing anything in her power to make it happen", "I really hope they do it\u2019s what op deserves after treating them this way.

To cover up the smell?", "What!? Defecated in his pants!? This is a time to put your foot down, OP. If I were Alana I would not be your friend anymore", "10 seconds in an uncomfortable situation on top of gagging due to the stench is going to feel a whole lot more than 10 seconds to that woman.", "Agreed actually, that's the real solution.

Totally missed that tidbit of info \ud83d\ude02", "I thought that at traditional weddings usually opposite sex members of the party are partnered for the aisle walk in both directions, with the notable exception of the MOH, who enters right before the bride and her escort (usually but not always her Dad), and the Best Man, who is standing beside the groom at the altar as the groom awaits the bride's arrival.  The exceptions are if one side outnumbers the other, including the bride and groom both being close enough to young children that they have more than one flower girl or ringbearer.", "Perhaps she should\u2019ve done everything in her power to raise a man who wipes his ass", "Probably but I\u2019m still stuck on why.

Because it isn\u2019t going to change.\n\nPart of a friendship is stepping in, stepping up, and protecting them from people like Joel. Your husband apparently doesn\u2019t give a crap about how the women feel. That says a lot about him.", "YTA, I don't understand how can you in good conscience put a woman literally in the hands of a creep. This speaks volumes of the type of person you are, no matter why are you doing this. \n\nHowever, two questions:\n- Why does you MIL have so much say in your wedding? Is it so hard for you to establish some boundaries?\n- What's the issue with telling your MIL this guy is a creep and is in the best interest of everyone to keep him out of the wedding party, and she should be thanking up there that this guy is allowed at all at a wedding? You are not asking for her permission nor her opinion, just state the facts about you know... Your own wedding. \n\nDon't tell me about fiance's happiness, because fiance was happy when his brother wasn't in the wedding party. He should grow some pants and back you (AND HIMSELF) up. Otherwise why are you marrying a mama's boy? And for him, why is he marrying someone who would put a woman, as a said before, in the literal hands of a creep? \n\nPeople, this is YOUR wedding, YOU make the calls. I'm assuming that people who get married do so because they are an established and independent couple, not an appendix of their parents. Otherwise go back to living with your parents until each one of you can be your own independent person and stand up for yourselves.\n\nYou might ask why the aggressive response? What you are doing to the women in your party is more than disgusting. And you don't seem to give it the importance it actually has. What a fucking shame.", "Why is a grown man shitting his pants, is there something physically wrong with him?", "Right? I would definitely be dropping OP and her husband as a friend, and I wouldn't be waiting until after the wedding to do so, either.", "Yeah...I was all for just dealing with it until I read that little bit.", "Honey, you don\u2019t have a wedding party problem here. You have a fianc\u00e9 problem. He is bending to what his mother wants just to avoid the conflict. If he\u2019s willing to do this for your wedding, you need to seriously think about whether or not he will establish or support boundaries once you\u2019re married. What will he capitulate to if you have kids? This is much bigger than just who walks with the creepy brother.", "I don't comment very often but this story is quite the cluster fuck.  MIL is making you guys include someone who shits themselves in your wedding ceremony and your fiance won't stand up for the bridal party feeling uncomfortable around them you are gonna either have a miserable marriage or end in divorce. YTA for forcing any of your \"friends\" to put up with someone who makes them uncomfortable. Same room would be fine.
