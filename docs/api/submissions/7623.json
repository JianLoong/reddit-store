Always remember your mom is choosing her ego over having a relationship with you and your family. Read that again- she is choosing her ego and being in control over a relationship with you and your family. Her ego and control over you is more important to her. Trust me we went through this with my mil also even down the depression and medicine. \n\nAs for her depression medicine- her depression is NOT your responsibility. I highly doubt that it was just doubled over this episode. Even if it was she needs therapy because the medication alone isn\u2019t fixing her problems.", "Hon, your mom is abusive. Please don't let your kid near her and consider getting some therapy for yourself. Your family is very dysfunctional.\n\nBlock your aunt also. You are not responsible for your mother's mental health. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Your mother has some very abusive and unpleasant traits and you are completely right to keep your child away from them.  If she can't accept that her loss of contact is due to her own actions, then there just isn't more to be done.  You and your wife are not her doormats and kudos to you for standing firm against her.  I suspect that your grandmother's idea of \"move past this\" is for you to toddle on back for more abuse, but I'm wondering if that is where your mother learned her own behaviors.", "NTA. Your mother needs to grow up & apologize, she's way overstepped her place. Frankly, an apology isn't sufficient; she should demonstrate a lot of changed behavior, as well, before you let her back into your lives. And her flying monkeys need to settle themselves down & stop attacking you, because they're not helping her cause at all.", "This is a cycle of mistreatment. You've paused the cycle. Don't let her steamroll you into letting it continue unchecked.\n\nGrandparents have little rights to grandkids (barring special circumstances like parental death) and if she wants to be around her grandkid, she needs to learn that in this situation its your way or the highway. She doesn't get the best of both worlds. She had her chance to raise a kid.  Now its your turn. \n\nNTA", ">Am I doing the right thing?\n\nYes, you keep protecting your family.

Don't think of this time as withholding your child.  Think of it as separating from a toxic relationship.\n\nThat's a pretty messed up thing to say and sounds like she is narcissistic.", "NTA - You would if you didn't degend your wife and yourself. Also, defend your child. You know what kid wants to hear their parents be bashed? None of them. In fact it would hurt their self-esteem to hear that. It's funny your mom goes on about your abusive father...does she criticize her emotionally abusive self? Because that's what she's doing to you and your wife, emotionally abusing you. Good men don't tolerate their wives being abused.", "NTA and I think for the mental health of you, your wife, and your child, you should probably go LC or NC permanently with your mom. Just because you\u2019re used to her constant manipulation and criticism doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy or right. And who knows what she would end up saying to your child as they get older. Grandparents don\u2019t automatically deserve a relationship with grandchildren if they\u2019re going to be hurtful. And you\u2019re right; if not seeing him was really breaking her heart, she\u2019d swallow her pride and apologize.", "NTA\n\nYour baby is a human being. He is not Prozac to be used by your mother. That would be way too much responsibility to place on such tiny shoulders.\n\nYour mother may have raised 2 kids but she isn\u2019t raising your kid. You and your wife know your baby the best and definitely know better than your mother when it comes to your child.", "NTA\n\nYour mom has serious control issues and her insistence that she knows better than the doctors what's best for your baby is, to put it nicely, insanely reckless.\n\nLook up the Dunning-Kreuger Effect.  Your mom is living this.   Basically, she doesn't know she doesn't know something.  The net result is she's completely confident in totally wrong information.  And when it comes to medical advice, it's far more important to listen to your doctors than your mom.\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing.  You're putting the baby's needs first, here above your mom's **want** to completely control your baby.\n\nAnd your baby, and your wife don't need constant argument **and actual emotional abuse** from your mother.  So keeping her away from the baby is the best thing.  It doesn't matter if your mom is depressed.  And it doesn't matter if you lose her, frankly.\n\nThe only way you can \"keep\" her is by tolerating her control freak, emotionally abusive nature.  It's too high a price to pay.", "NTA!  You're actually being a wonderful parent and spouse.\n\nYour aunt and grandma are acting as your mom's [flying monkeys](https://narcissistabusesupport.com/red-flags/use-flying-monkeys/).  You can tell them that you don't want to discuss your mother with them anymore and then enforce that by hanging up or walking away every time they raise the subject.", "NTA. The only parenting advice, book, what have you that you and your wife need is to look at how your mom and her family treat \"loved\" ones and then do the exact opposite.  I'm sorry your mom's depression medication has been increased, but that's HER issue to resolve through professional assistance, not yours.", "NTA. Block your aunt and tell your grandma this is the bed your mother made.", "NTA.  Your family deserves better. Keep your child away from her.", "NTA.\n\nr/raisedbynarcissists is a good place to get some insight into your mother's behaviors. Whether she is certifiably a narc does not matter, the behaviors are the same. Lots of good info and tips to help you navigate the minefields your mother creates.\n\nIf your mother is a negative influence in your family's (you, DW and kiddo) life, you need to continue enforcing your boundary (needing an apology, respecting your parenting) so she will either learn to keep her trap shut, or you will not have contact with her. \n\nShe will never apologize. The flying monkeys (FMs) who do her bidding will try to pressure you to let her back in without any consequences. Block them all and have a peaceful life. No one needs that kind of negativity, especially a young family who is working to build their own family on their own terms.\n\nGo have a read on r/JUSTNOMIL and r/motherinlawsfromhell. You will see a lot of posts such as yours. Lots of good advice, too, that will validate your feelings.\n\nThe most important factor in this situation is that YOU protect your little family from the old hags in YOUR family.

If so why? My point is, she can't treat you like crap and expect you to take it just cause she's your mom and allegedly knows best.

You are a wonderful husband and father. It\u2019s great that you are focusing on building an amazing family with your wife. \n\nI would suggest not viewing it as trading one family for another. You have grown and developed healthy boundaries. Your mother refuses to grow and respect healthy boundaries. Until she\u2019s willing and able to do the work, a relationship is simply incompatible. If she ever does seem to be willing to change, I highly recommend that only you resume a relationship with her until you have a healthy and mutually respectful relationship with her. If she\u2019s been this way all your life then I would say she needs to prove it for at least a year and show that she understands why it has t be this way.
