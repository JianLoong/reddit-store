{"id": 774, "submission_id": "yjl4f2", "title": "AITA for asking my girlfriend to make a safety deposit before we plan a date?", "selftext": " Please note that this is not your usual relationship. I've been dating a borderline diagnosed girl for half a year. She's great and I love her, but I have a problem with her flaking me.\n\nWe met online, we chatted for a month and we were extremely excited to meet each other in a hotel, last summer. A week before she asked me if it would be a problem if we delayed our meeting by a week. *Why? -- because my boss asked me to come on Sunday*. It was a temporary job and not a career worth sweating over, she quit it herself a month later.\n\nThe problem is, being flaked or postponed (without a good reason) is an intense CPTSD trigger for me. My father went to buy bread and it took him 8 years to return. And many other stories from my childhood. Whatever. I communicated it as clearly as I could, asking her to avoid doing that again.\n\nThe situation repeated once again. She was supposed to fly over to my country, we were looking to rent a studio together. I needed her to be present to aid me in the search. Everything was planned with mutual agreement. Suddenly, she said she's gonna come a week later. That's one of the variables that led me to ending up homeless (as my previous contract was running out).\n\nI flied to her country, she was begging me to come over and visit her. She refused to pick me up from the airport because I hurt her feelings a few days earlier. And she didn't pick up the phone for two days.\n\nAfter two days of waiting for her in her country, we made up and finally met. I was renting a single room in a hostel. She spent a night with me. The next day we went to rent a double room. We were very happy. She went to work, I waited for her.\n\nThat evening, she messaged me that she will be spending the night somewhere else. I asked why. She said it's because she's having a job interview tomorrow. *But why didn't you tell me?* \\-- *Well, I found that job offer while you were sleeping last night*. My CPTSD was triggered again, I spent the night walking around the hostel to calm down, drinking beer and doing unhealthy things to cope.\n\nTwo months later, she's asking me to fly again. I told her that I can, but I require her to make a symbolic refundable deposit of 400 EUR - if she does show up, she will get it all back. If she flakes me again, I will use that money to cope by spending it on hoes. My reasoning is that if she doesn't feel guilty about breaking promises, if she doesn't feel the obligation emotionally, then maybe she will feel it financially.\n\nIn total, if I remember correctly, she flaked me 5 times. Each one hurt. Each time it was brought up, she got very defensive, *what's your problem - my best friend doesn't mind when I do that to him.*\n\nShe's laughing and saying that it's a ridiculous request. *My BF requires a deposit to see me hahahhah*.
