There are tons of them everywhere (a lot left over from early colonial days), and it's a pretty normal thing here to just go to a cemetery to look at the old headstones, or for teenagers (not necessarily goths or anything) to just hang out in them. Sometimes elementary school classes are taken to cemeteries to do rubbings of old headstones as a history lesson. One of the big cemeteries near Boston is also a botanical garden (like, the plants and the graves are all in the same park together) and they have special events for Mother's Day! For us cemeteries are normal places to be, they're not \"morbid\" in the way other people might feel about them.", "It's perfectly normal for you and for your culture to do that in a holiday. \n\nNot in mine.", "Yta, Easy don't marry into this family...", "Well then you might need to consider finding a different person to have children with.

Your family are Spiritualists, apparently your boyfriend's family are not. How are you going to live with the differences?

The only way you might be an AH is to insist they get over losing a loved one, but I read that as part of your upbringing. You could do better to try and understand that grief takes many forms and different timelines for everyone\u2014and no one ever gets to tell anyone else to \u201cget over it\u201d on a timeline of someone else\u2019s choosing. \n\nTell your boyfriend that going to the graveyard depresses you and that to honor them in your way you\u2019d rather hear stories of the loved one\u2019s life when folks get back from the cemetery.", "So, I agree with you.

It\u2019s theirs and they have a right to it, but it\u2019s fine to have a differing opinion to it.", "YTA\n\nMy family does this. It\u2019s just part of our culture. We go to celebrate quickly with our ancestors. We might incense and wish them merry Christmas/ happy new year/ etc. \n\nMaybe you could be open minded to their traditions and not compare it to yours. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s morbid at all.", "YTA just don't go", "NTA for being annoyed, but this is something you knew going into the relationship. Be an adult and have a conversation.", "I would also like to add that it is not always about grief. It can be about remembering your loved ones who passed away and to show respect to your heritage. Their tradition sounds similar to All Saint's Day where you light a candle for a lost soul. Some people even bring more candles to light them on the long forgotten graves.\n\n\nFurthermore, I visited quite a fair amount of graves with different people. And most of them would have moments of sadness but then they would start recalling happy memories which brought smile.\n\nOverall, I have trouble understanding that this post is actually real. OP you asked your bf about it and he gave you clear answer. If you cannot respect something he cares about or you don't even try to understand it and think only about what you want - stop talking about potential kids. Such future simply doesn't exist.", "No kidding. OP just sounds callous. My father passed suddenly in 2017. I think about him often, though I don't visit where he's buried often myself. But if that's part of their thing and it's not hurting anything (quite the opposite, if I were to go out on a limb), then let them choose to enjoy their memories of their loved one(s) the way they see fit.", "Same with my mama. Her parents, sibling, aunts uncles and cousins are there. It's actually fun to share memories and stories from the past.", "This sounds lovely. The entire idea sounds lovely! I\u2019m not terribly close with a lot of my extended family, but if I could visit the tree where we scattered my grandma\u2019s ashes on Christmas I think I would.

It is grieving and the sadness is overwhelming to me.", "No one is saying OP would be an AH for not going. OP is the AH for telling her BF his family shouldn\u2019t go.

There is no evidence other than OP finding visiting a cemetery to be depressing that the boyfriend and his family are having trouble processing their grief.\n\nIt's not a matter of OP coming from a culture that is 'healthier' in the way that they process grief. Different cultures have different ways of dealing with death and different doesn't mean that one is better. It just means that one culture believes something else about the situation.\n\nIf you believe that after your loved one dies, there is nothing but I believe that my dead loved one is in Heaven and I will see them again, which belief system will provide for a better more healthier process for our grief? Are both not valid for helping a person to cope with a loss depending on their belief system?", "It's Memorial *Day.* \n\nOP is dealing with Memorial Lifetime.", "I have lost several loved ones during my life. My grandmother was very dear to me and I miss her a lot, everyone in my family as well. We talk and remember her a lot. \n\nAnd we still do not grieve her by visiting her grave. No one would ever consider doing so after chistmas dinner.\n\nIf I had low empathy, I'd have no problem going there. It's exactly for being too empathetic and getting so sad and depressed everytime I go, that Ive decided I can't anymore.", "This is an extremely common holiday tradition in many many cultures.

AH, definitely. Everyone goes to graveyards, atleast once a year if you have someone you know there. You don't need to be sad being there.\n\nPut it this way. It's a giant park with flowers.

I think the major part of what\u2019s off putting to most people here is that you reacted without understanding why it\u2019s a tradition. But for what it\u2019s worth, since it\u2019s a cultural different I think your boyfriend is an AH for calling you one without having a discussion about why they to it, especially since you\u2019re not from the same place so you may not understand it (which you\u2019ve admitted you don\u2019t).", "That sounds intense, but it might not be experienced the same way by them. Communicate or get out seem to be your options", "> If you believe that after your loved one dies, there is nothing but I believe that my dead loved one is in Heaven and I will see them again, which belief system will provide for a better more healthier process for our grief?\n\nThat sounds pretty judgy. If I believe my dead loved one is reborn as every bowl of spaghetti I'll ever encounter, is that just a belief or a delusion?", "I recognized that in my original post and I quote myself\n\n*However I do recognize that it is very traditional for some families to visit graves on certain days. I respect that tradition even though it isn't mine.*\n\nHowever this isn't OP's tradition and so my question was whether she was obligated to do so and how far down the generations is the expectation. \n\nThis is especially true since OP actively finds the practice uncomfortable so that the future should include discussions of how to accommodate both her, their partner and their children", "What do you think I'm doing posting on the internet?", "I enjoy cemeteries. When I was a kid we\u2019d go every Memorial Day, it was like visiting a big beautiful park with a pond and swans, it was a particularly nice cemetery. When we travel we visit cemeteries and view the headstones and think about life and what may have been going on in people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s a lot of history in cemeteries. As a visiting nurse I\u2019d often take my lunch break in one cemetery or other, peaceful and shady. I used to take my kids too (they\u2019re grown now). It\u2019s your boyfriend\u2019s family tradition, it\u2019s nice.

I guess it's not weird for me or for you as this is something we've always done. It's not harmful and it's a way to learn about your family and local history.
