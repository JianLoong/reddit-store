After every meal, they go to the graveyard visit their late grandfather's grave.\nHe has passed away for more than 10 years now. \n\nNow my grandmother has passed away not long ago,  3 years since.

Now that me and my boyfriend are really getting serious and thinking of marriage, I've realized it will be like this always.

He thought I was being an asshole. \n\nBut I'm getting increasingly annoyed every year, and strongly considering to enquiry the others about this. \n\nINFO-2: I always go with them without saying anything, because I feel like it would be rude of me to refuse it and say Id rather be alone in the house.\n\nINFO-3: I think people are really misunderstanding me here. I would never tell them to stop their traditions. Instead what I thought about doing, is to tell them I don't feel comfortable about it and that I don't want to be part of it. Because I really feel it ruins my holiday, I get sad when I visit a graveyard. \n\nEDIT: I'd like to add that this is not a tradition in my home country and even less to my family. I told family and friends about this, and they all thought it was pretty morbid and weird. \n\nMoreover my family are spiritualists and they believe the soul leaves the body and what's left behind is meaningless. That's what I learned while growing up. I never went to cemeteries back home, and the only times I went to a cemetery was when a loved one died and I had a funeral.\n\nEDIT-2: I accept I am an asshole for not understanding that people process grief differently.

What you and your family did for your grandmother is irrelevant as to whether it's okay for his family to visit their grandfather's grave. Your discomfort with participating in it is something you should talk to your bf about when it isn't the holiday so the two of you can talk about how to go forward since you are talking about marriage.

There are tons of them everywhere (a lot left over from early colonial days), and it's a pretty normal thing here to just go to a cemetery to look at the old headstones, or for teenagers (not necessarily goths or anything) to just hang out in them. Sometimes elementary school classes are taken to cemeteries to do rubbings of old headstones as a history lesson. One of the big cemeteries near Boston is also a botanical garden (like, the plants and the graves are all in the same park together) and they have special events for Mother's Day! For us cemeteries are normal places to be, they're not \"morbid\" in the way other people might feel about them.", "It's perfectly normal for you and for your culture to do that in a holiday. \n\nNot in mine.", "Yta, Easy don't marry into this family...", "Well then you might need to consider finding a different person to have children with.

Your family are Spiritualists, apparently your boyfriend's family are not. How are you going to live with the differences?

The only way you might be an AH is to insist they get over losing a loved one, but I read that as part of your upbringing.

They may think you\u2019ll visit them, but you won\u2019t.  You may go once a year if they\u2019re lucky but it won\u2019t be the cemetery excursion they go through every holiday and make the rest of us feel guilty.  How would those people feel knowing we dread visiting them when they\u2019re gone.  We need to visit each other now while we\u2019re all alive.  Hate me if you want but I will go to all the funerals and graveside services because it\u2019s the right thing to do.  Don\u2019t expect me to go any other time unless I want to.  No guilt tripping, she loved you she would be disappointed.  No she wouldn\u2019t look at all the other achievements I\u2019ve made that she\u2019s going to be proud of.  Visiting a grave is not something to be looked at as a chore.  Do it out of love not obligation.  Needless to say I was grounded.  My Uncles who accompanied my Aunts on this trip looked like we don\u2019t have to do this anymore I\u2019m out.  So the Aunts went none of the other family members made the trek.  Now we have one cousin who does the cemetery adventure because her mom, my Aunt told her it\u2019s he job.   She hates it. When her husband too her that her place is with her family and if she chose the cemetery then he knows where the family stands.", "Yta. If you don\u2019t like the traditions, don\u2019t go. Break up. Find a family with your traditions. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have kids and argue on how they are raised.", "YTA off title alone", "On the way up to my grandpas for the past 7 years every holiday we stop at the cemetery to say hi to my gma. I don\u2019t feel anything there but it soothes my mom. It soothes his family and it\u2019s only your job to support him YTA", "As a Dane, YTA", "YTA, you're getting annoyed at how a family processed their grief, which doesn't really affect you unless you want to act offended about it. \n\nIf going to a graveyard makes you sad to the point it \"ruins the holiday\" for you, maybe you could talk about it with a therapist.", "[removed]", "We don't do this every holiday, but we do on Christmas Eve. My grandparents were big Christmas celebrators and we had tons of traditions. My grandpa was a professional Santa for most of his adult life. And we live 5 minutes away from the cemetery. One of our traditions is doing luminaries, so we take 2 luminaries to their grave, sing a couple carols, and head home. It's not a grief thing for me: it's a remembrance and celebration thing. As we spend our Christmas Eve continuing the traditions they taught us, it's nice to go and spend a moment thinking about and celebrating them specifically. It only takes a few minutes, and it's a nice way to end the day.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

What culture is this? (I wouldn't knock the tradition but I'd def be politely opting out.)", "Have you ever had an in-depth conversation with his parents or the elders in his family as to the significance & meaning of their custom of visiting the gravesites on the holidays? Their answers may truly surprise you & reveal a more joyful meaning than what you associate with it. \n\nJust because you were raised to believe one way, doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t be open to other viewpoints. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t advise telling any of them that you\u2019re uncomfortable doing this & especially not that it ruins your holiday. That would be interpreted as highly offensive. Please take your cue from your bf on this. \n\nOnce you have a thorough understanding of their custom, it may not be so difficult for you to endure & perhaps even begin to fully embrace the traditions & customs of this family. \n\nDifferent doesn\u2019t mean wrong.", "My great aunts always left flowers at our family plot every Christmas.  Even though my great grandfather died in 1977 and their mother died in 1952. And we're Irish Catholic.  Now that they're gone I try to leave some flowers at the cemetery if I'm in town for the holidays. I don't find it morbid at all.", "Do you really talk to people this way? How artful.  Maybe she should write down her remarks first before she says something.", "I find it strange myself, not being accustomed to it. But I think the bigger question is why does it make OP so sad? They aren\u2019t related to the person in the grave. Many cemeteries are beautiful, she could focus on nature or just enjoy the walk. Cemeteries aren\u2019t inherently sad.", "Are you fucking kidding??? She isn\u2019t telling him she prefers chocolate to vanilla. She\u2019s talking to him about his family\u2019s tradition for MOURNING THEIR DEAD LOVED ONES. She put thought into it over the course of several years. Don\u2019t be purposely obtuse. No one expects her to delicately craft her approach to every conversation but this wasn\u2019t a normal conversation and needed to be approached with a tiny bit of empathy"]}
