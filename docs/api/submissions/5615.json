What you and your family did for your grandmother is irrelevant as to whether it's okay for his family to visit their grandfather's grave. Your discomfort with participating in it is something you should talk to your bf about when it isn't the holiday so the two of you can talk about how to go forward since you are talking about marriage.

I am from Denmark as well and my family also visits the graveyard, where our family is buried. I think this is quite common in Denmark around the holidays. I feel like when you are at his family for the holidays then follow the traditions that they have or maybe you and your boyfriend are just not compatible, since he obviously also thinks you are an AH. Maybe you just don\u2019t get either his family or maybe even the danish culture", "Let me tell you, this will never change. Think really hard about whether or not you want your kids to have this experience. If not, you need to leave this relationship. This is important to your boyfriend\u2019s family, and when you brought it up to him, he thought you were an AH for doing so. Knowing this, if you have kids with him, you will be an AH if you try to stop it then. Kids do not deserve to be pulled between parents. \n\nIf you can learn from the mistakes of millions of us, who you choose to have children with is important. Do not think you can walk in and change tradition of your partner who is okay with said tradition. Substitute tradition with culture, personality, expectations, etc.", "Have you explained this to your boyfriend without dismissing his culture and traditions? It sounds like you expect him and his family to honor yours but you don\u2019t want to honor his. I\u2019d re-evaluate whether you want to continue in this relationship because clearly family is important to him as is his culture and traditions. It will only get worse if you two aren\u2019t compatible in this.", ">I can't help my upbringing either and find it an extremely disturbing experience for me. It really ruins my holiday and I get sad and try not to cry everytime I go there. For me it's an extremely sad and depressing experience. \n\nWell, why can't you just \"get over it and move on\"?\n\nYou expect them to do so, but you can't be bothered to do it yourself?", "It's a huge tradition in the Nordics, also with my family. But if you get really distressed by it, you can skip it yourself. I'm sure no one will force you to go.\n\nFor me it was always a special thing as a child to go light candles on graves, not so sad because I hadn't even met the deceased people.\n\nIn my family it got really depressing after losing a lot of loved ones recently, so we decided to go to the graves already on the 23rd, so we can grieve then, but have Christmas Eve be a happier holiday. If you get more committed, maybe you could suggest something like that? Some people have a hard time changing traditions, others are open to switching it up a bit.", "Yes and that's OK. They have invited you into this probably incredibly vulnerable family practice. You are allowed to decline. You are not allowed to oppose it", "Why is it hard to understand or accept? You\u2019re just supposed to bury loved ones and then never go to visit them again? It\u2019s perfectly normal to visit the cemetary during different holidays or the birthday of the deceased. It\u2019s not even necessarily a sad activity - if normally I would stop by grandma\u2019s place on christmas eve, now that she\u2019s dead I\u2019d just visit her at the cemetary \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well I haven't changed anything.\n\nBut I don't want my kids to do the same.", "Ok I'm not obliged to 100% integrate and absorb the culture of the country I moved into it and adopt all of their traditions.\n\nI will respect it and won't judge it anymore, since now it's very clear to me it's a cultural thing. But I won't be a part of it. \n\nI don't like graveyards, even though in Denmark they act like parks. \n\nAnd even less if it's in a holiday, and I much rather spend my Christmas eating, drinking and laughing, then going to a trip into the cemetery.", "Joining a family with different cultures and traditions is hard. The key is to merge rather than replace. For instance, is there a tradition from your culture that you could prepare while they are at the cemetery. A simple \"while you guys go see loved ones passed, I'm going to make you the traditional boozy hot drink from my culture to warm you up when you return\" pays respect to them, and introduces your traditions to their holiday.", "Maybe just start conversation like \u201dhey, we never did this in my family/culture, and therefore it feels a bit strange to me. Could you tell more about this tradition?\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s really cool that youve taken the step to understand the cultural differences and brave to move to a completely new country! Open communication is really important in unifying families and traditions. And you dont have to visit the cemetary if it feels uncomfortable, but i\u2019d recommend to be open about you feelings and understanding theirs, so no-one feels disrespected :)", "You're right that it's a lot to learn and to handle. (I've lived on a few different countries, so I know what you're getting at a bit.) I think people would have reacted to your post a lot differently if you'd put it like this instead of \"why can't they just get over it,\" because the second phrasing sounds like you think this is some personal hangup of the family's and comes off insensitive, whereas here you sound pretty self-aware.\n\nAnother perspective that might help you view this differently: I'm from New England in the US, and while not everyone spends time at loved ones' graves like this, cemeteries aren't depressing places for us. There are tons of them everywhere (a lot left over from early colonial days), and it's a pretty normal thing here to just go to a cemetery to look at the old headstones, or for teenagers (not necessarily goths or anything) to just hang out in them. Sometimes elementary school classes are taken to cemeteries to do rubbings of old headstones as a history lesson. One of the big cemeteries near Boston is also a botanical garden (like, the plants and the graves are all in the same park together) and they have special events for Mother's Day! For us cemeteries are normal places to be, they're not \"morbid\" in the way other people might feel about them.", "It's perfectly normal for you and for your culture to do that in a holiday. \n\nNot in mine.", "Yta, Easy don't marry into this family...", "Well then you might need to consider finding a different person to have children with. They way people grieve can absolutely be a deal breaker. You might just be incompatible. If this is something you both find to be a hill to die on, then you have to accept that the relationship dies.", "> He thought I was being the asshole.\n\nI don\u2019t think you need to worry about your kids doing the same \ud83d\ude02", "Then plan on not marrying into this family. You not wanting to have your imaginary children engage with this form of grief has an easy solution.", "Don\u2019t have kids with him, he deserves better than to be tied to someone who doesn\u2019t respect his traditions. YTA.", "YTA, this is cultural in the Nordics. You\u2019re denying your kids half of their family heritage.", "Hi, you\u2019ve already got a huge load of TAs, so l wont add another one. I just want to suggest you  a change of approach.\n\n1. If your bf wanted to stop this tradition, he would had stopped. If he continues to go, it would be a huge mistake to bring it up. If you really can\u2019t handle it, break-up and don\u2019t date anyone from Nordics, probably.\n\n2. Graveyards are, in fact, amazing places full of peace and silence, nature and life. Especially those close to the cities. All those trees and bushes, flowers, various birds, sometimes rabbits. Once I\u2019ve even seen a family of foxes at a cemetery. It\u2019s a place where old is connecting new. I don\u2019t want to get philosophical here, l just want to say that you can somehow reframe your view on graveyards.", "INFO. What do you mean after every meal they visit the grave? Do they visit after Christmas lunch? Or is literally every meal?", "I also feel it's the same in Denmark. Cemeteries are just normal parks and people actually hang out in them.", "It\u2019s not standard in my culture either, but I wouldn\u2019t have this much of an attitude about it. It\u2019s a tradition of theirs, either honour it graciously or be honest with them about why it\u2019s too difficult to stomach every year and politely sit it out. YTA for how you\u2019re seeing it and expecting him to stop just because you feel you\u2019ve gotten more serious as a couple.\n\nEdit: typo", "It might not be common in some cultures but you make it sound as if the family decided to go to a strip joint after dinner. Like it isn\u2019t a mind blowing concept that people also pay attention to departed family members during a family-centered holiday", "It\u2019s perfectly normal for their family. YTA. Don\u2019t join it then.", "It's extremely disturbing and depressive for me. I always end up having to hide my tears, and I didn't even know the people there.", "To quote your own words back at you\n\nWhy can't you just get over it and move on?", "I understand that you have an extremely strong reaction to a thing that is pretty mundane for some others. You don\u2019t need to go with them, if you explain it like this they would understand. I hope that after getting some comments here it will be easier for you to accept and understand that some people like to do this.", "It\u2019s not about you. Jfc why can\u2019t you wrap your head around that? All of your comments are about how this makes YOU feel, and how YOU feel uncomfortable. Just don\u2019t go. Let them grieve without your judgmental attitude.", "Maybe you need to examine your own feelings about death and the dead. Are you afraid? Are you uncomfortable with being sad? Maybe you need to develop a better relationship with your own feelings; it's ok to feel sad. It doesn't have to be a big deal. Feel your feelings, then move on with your day.", "I find your continued use of disturbing to be an issue.\n\nI also don\u2019t understand why you have to hide your tears. Why can\u2019t you cry? Do they judge you for it? In my experience crying is more than okay in these moments. That\u2019s what they are for: a safe and appropriate space for grief to crest, allowing people to get to the other side where they can find ways to move forward. Tears usually lead to laughter, or at least to peace.\n\nMy culture also has wakes. I grew up going to them. Sometimes people even touch the bodies as a sign of respect or love.\n\nI more than understand that\u2019s not for everyone. In fact it\u2019s the exact opposite of my partner\u2019s culture.\n\nIf visiting the grave isn\u2019t for you I hope you don\u2019t feel forced into going. That would be highly inappropriate. I also hope if you decide to go that any respectful participation is accepted by his family, even if that is standing quietly to the side.\n\nMy partner doesn\u2019t approach the body at wakes. I only participe in the parts of their culture\u2019s mourning that I feel comfortable with. We respect each other very much. I know my cultures traditions often make them uncomfortable and respect their boundaries. They in turn don\u2019t stop our children from participating.\n\nIt would break my heart if my partner found my culture disturbing.\n\nYou feel how you feel and there may be a language difference here but disturbing is such a charged and powerful word. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with what they are doing. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to at least accept your boyfriend\u2019s culture then this might not be the relationship for you."]}
