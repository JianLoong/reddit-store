Over the past 6 months our friendship has been a little tense, we\u2019ve been fighting more which is really unlike us, and there\u2019s been a distance between us. \n\nA few weeks ago my friend went to a work party after work at her bosses house. At about 11p at night, I get a text from her phone that says \u201cyou\u2019re friend got too drunk. She\u2019s fine just really scared and you need to come pick her up.\u201d I was on a date with my boyfriend (35m) at the time but we stopped our date and drove to the house. \n\nWhen we got there there were tons of people and drugs everywhere. (Cocaine, etc). They led me to a room where she was passed out. There were people all around her and some were laughing and taking pictures. Anyway, we tried to wake her up and she wouldn\u2019t wake up. My boyfriend tried to pick her up (she\u2019s maybe 165lbs) but said she was like dead weight and couldn\u2019t. At that point she screamed at him \u201cput me the fuck down!\u201d  I guess she had woken up briefly? But then she was unconscious again. This pissed my boyfriend off and he went off and started playing beer bong.\n\nAt this point the other girls at the party were getting catty and saying that we needed to leave. They said \u201cthis isn\u2019t a party and you weren\u2019t invited\u201d. I offered to stay the night, but the forced me to leave. \n\nI texted my friend as soon as I left and explained the situation. \n\nThe next morning, my friend calls me and says that she had been drugged. She took a drug test and there were barbiturates in her system. She was on antidepressants and claimed that she believed she died at some point due to the drug interaction. \n\nOver the next two weeks I barely hear from her. It\u2019s super weird. Then she texts me and really coldly says \u201c we need to talk\u201d. We met up for coffee and she basically said \u201cI can\u2019t be friends with someone who would leave me drugged and dying on the floor.\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t know she was drugged and I didn\u2019t know she was \u201cdying\u201d but she didn\u2019t care. She said regardless you don\u2019t leave a girl in that position. I told her the people forced me to leave and she said that I should have called 911 then. \n\nNothing I said turned her around and I got really upset she was listening to what the other girls at the party were saying happened over my words. I told her that when she was ready to apologize I\u2019d be here, but until then I guess we\u2019re not friends. \n\nAITAH", "created_utc": 1693234214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163o5y2/aitah_for_leaving_my_friend_passed_out_at_a_party/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend is also a shitty person.\n\nShe doesn't need a \"friend\" like you.", "YTA. I wouldn't ever speak to you again.", "YTA. You probably should have called 911 when you saw how out of it she was. Her lack of responsiveness coupled with the drugs lying around everywhere should have been red flags that told you to call 911.", "I mean... were you technically responsible for a grown-ass woman?

It's dangerous to leave someone in that situation. It shouldn't matter if she's dying or not. You said people were already circling her and making comments, maybe she was even assaulted during the course of the night. If you couldn't move her, then call an ambulance to take her away.", "YTA - Jesus christ, you didn't just leave her passed out at a party (which, by the way, would still absolutely make you the AH), you left her at a party with rude sketchy people doing tons of drugs. Maybe no one was bothering her and she seemed safe enough when you were there, but what about a few hours later? When people are going to bed or passing out? Some drunk skeezy dude sees a passed out woman? The chances of sexual assault were astronomical.\n\nIf anyone should be apologizing, it should be you; huge, desperate apologies, even so she still might not accept them, which is totally understandable.", "YTA, there were people around her taking pictures and making comments, she was not in a safe environment. I wouldn\u2019t leave anyone in a position like that, let alone my \u201c best friend.\u201d The fact that you aren\u2019t on your knees begging her to forgive you means that you probably never were a good friend.", "YTA.

You should have called 911 as soon as you realized she wasn't waking up.", "YTA you left her, you weren't dragged out forced to leave you chose to leave under peer pressure, you should have called 911 if you felt so unsafe to stay there, even if she was just drunk and not drugged then that's still unsafe for her, you're not her friend", "Yta why would you literally just leave her there unconscious. Boyfriend could\u2019ve grabbed her arms and you get her feet, or you could\u2019ve asked the other people around if someone could help. Last option is the police, but leaving? Yeah no that\u2019s definitely a valid reason to never talk to you again.", "She doesn\u2019t owe you an apology for anything\u2026you left her in the most classic, dangerous position and think SHE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE??\n\nNo, she need a much better friend than you.\n\nYTA", "Ya uh you should have called the police if she was in that state.", "YTA and so is everyone else at that party who didn\u2019t call 911 when someone was passed out and not waking up when people tried.", "Yta.

Both you and your boyfriend. Your supposedly \"best friend\" of 10 years was passed out, people were laughing at her and taking photos of her and you just left her there? You didn't have the minimum decency to call 911/the police. She was drugged. The amount of women that get drugged and parties and assaulted is astounding. SHE is the one that deserves an apology, not you. I hope she cuts you off as a friend.", "YTA This is your best friend of ten years?

You should have taken her with you or called 911.", "NTA...", "YES YTA.\n\nReally? At your age you should know better than to leave your friend, clearly intoxicated, in a room full of strangers with open drug use.

What you did was wrong (you should have gotten her help), but you not knowing what to do would be somewhat forgivable. However, you should be apologizing to your friend, not the other way around. You are the asshole.", "YTA you left your former friend to die or be raped or whatever.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like an AH too.", "YTA. The thought that she got drugged and was going to get a train pulled on her didn't cross your mind.", "YTA\nLook you did what you could and felt was appropriate at the time. Would I have left a friend alone,  probably not but I'm definitely a worrier. You were also being thrown out of the house and with alcohol and drugs flying around it may not have been safe but in that case you definitely should have called authorities. But your friend thinking she died and is somehow still magically alive is a bit far fetched and she's blaming you for everything that happened that night.", "ESH. You definitely should have called 911 as soon as you realized you and BF alone couldn\u2019t help her. \n\nYour BF sucks for just giving up so easily. \n\nYour friend\u2019s friends suck because they didn\u2019t do anything to help either \n\nYour best friend suck the most imo because she put herself in that situation. I do think she\u2019s an asshole for choosing to go to this thing with clearly unreliable people around her, having no safety plan and expecting perfection in how people help her after she\u2019s passed out.", "ESH - you shouldn't have just left her there, especially if she wouldn't wake up.  At the same time though, your friend is 28.  She needs to take some accountability for her own actions here.  She chose to go to the party.  She chose to STAY at the party.", "NTa at all.", "NTA how were you supposed to know that she was drugged? You went out of your way to go to her and try and help her. If you were an asshole you would\u2019ve just ignored the text and went on with your date.", "NTA in any way\n\nyou tried to get her, she screamed at your BF when he tried to lift her, who seemed to have then gone off to enjoy himself. You didn't know she had taken drugs (willingly or not)\n\nIf she wants to remain friends she will apologise if not she won't. You need to have a word with your BF as well as he disappeared in to the party to enjoy himself.", "NTA she's a adult and can protect herself if she can't well she shouldnt be partying at all did you do the right thing for leaving her tho maybe not but you were forced out and like you said you didn't know she was drugged and maybe you could have been asleep too and all so I'm sorry you are not responsible of a other adult unless it's your kids she's your best friend yes but doesn't change the fact she couldn't protect herself as single bit of your best friend would have been a male everyone would have agreed that you did good to leave so nothing wrong here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She, on the other hand, does not owe you an apology for anything. It is frankly amazing that you think she does.\n\nYou left your friend in an extremely vulnerable and dangerous situation and went about your evening without a second thought. What if that had been you in that situation. Would you have been happy with the way it was handled? Would you want to be abandoned when you were in such a compromised situation that you were unconscious and unable to defend yourself against any inappropriate actions others may have committed upon you? Would you be angry at being left vulnerable to sexual assault. You would be fine with inappropriate photographs being taken of you, and possibly used for blackmail? Well, that is exactly what you did to your *best* friend. \n\nYour bf couldn't carry her, but that doesn't excuse you leaving her, nor does being 'told to leave'. You absolutely should have called 911, reported a medical emergency and requested an ambulance to attend. They would have transported her to the hospital and she would have been taken care of. Hospitals don't care if a patient is on drugs? They don't make judgments like that. Their mandate is to save lives and ensure the health and safety of their patients. \n\nYou and your boyfriend are both massive AHs. You don't leave a friend passed out at a party when they are obviously in an extremely vulnerable situation endangering both their health and safety. Your former *best* friend is much better off without someone as thoughtless and heartless as you. YTA.", "YTA. She's absolutely right, you should have called 911.", "Friend is right. The moment you saw just how inebriated she was and were forced by the hosts to leave, you should have called 911. Even before the drug stuff, she could have had alcohol poisoning.

It seems obvious that she'd taken something, willing or not. But ANYTHING could have happened to her.", "YTA. Your behavior is disgusting.", "I repeat what your friend said, that you should have called 911 then!! Why didn\u2019t you?? You had excuses for everything but conveniently didn\u2019t explain why you couldn\u2019t make a simple call. It literally would have costed you nothing. And you are clearly dismissing her health concerns by putting speech marks around \u201cdying\u201d, you still don\u2019t believe her and think she is over exaggerating but she has proof that she was drugged which is extremely dangerous. She could have easily overdosed or being hurt or raped. And you think she owes you an apology!? YTA", "Lot of YTA votes here, but only downvoted ESHs. Was no one else at the party an asshole? \n\nYour friend should not have gone to this party alone if there was not a single person there she could trust or was willing to really help her. Apparently she bares no responsibility for that, and it was OP\u2019s fault.\n\nIf no one had texted you to come get your friend, then you would not have even known she was there. She would have remained passed out and woken up there in the morning, so same exact outcome. Would OP still be the asshole then? \n\nA lot of folks saying an ambulance should be called, but if someone is cognizant enough to wake up and tell you to unhand them, then it\u2019s reasonable to assume they might not need an ambulance. Not to mention the huge financial burden an ambulance can cause in the US. It\u2019s not a cut and dry clear thing that OP should have without a doubt known she should call 911.\n\nOP is not running a rescue service, and this wasn\u2019t a party she was at or involved with. Would it have been heroic and kind-hearted for OP to be able to save the day? Of course. Is OP some huge asshole for not successfully maneuvering this tough situation that she was unexpectedly and unwillingly thrust into?

You didn't know she was drugged. The people at the party had the wherewithall to call you, but not call 911 themselves? Or help you carry her out of there? If it truly was her boss's house it was HIS responsibility to take care of his employee. Who knows what would have happened if you'd have called 911?  (Because I'm assuming you'd have stayed until 911 got there and everyone there would know you called the police.)\n\nYou were going to stay with her, the people at the party wouldn't let you. They wouldn't help carry her out. Your friend shouldn't have been drinking in the first place if she is on antidepressants. She is lucky nothing more happened to her.

Maybe, we weren't there. Should others at that party have done more? I believe so.

She didnt twll you before going to the party that if case anything happens you need to call the police for her, she was a t a party woth coke, so id understand if you were unsure to ca or not because maybe she would be mad you were a narc and blew up their spot by calling police, she should have communicated what she wanted to happen in this event. I dont think the blame is entirely on you, everyone here was pretty irresponsible. If i went to a party by myself but didnt communicate to anyone where i was going or to call the cops if anything bad happens etc i wouldnt cut off the only person who actually tried to help me.
