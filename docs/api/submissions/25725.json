Over the past 6 months our friendship has been a little tense, we\u2019ve been fighting more which is really unlike us, and there\u2019s been a distance between us. \n\nA few weeks ago my friend went to a work party after work at her bosses house. At about 11p at night, I get a text from her phone that says \u201cyou\u2019re friend got too drunk. She\u2019s fine just really scared and you need to come pick her up.\u201d I was on a date with my boyfriend (35m) at the time but we stopped our date and drove to the house. \n\nWhen we got there there were tons of people and drugs everywhere. (Cocaine, etc). They led me to a room where she was passed out. There were people all around her and some were laughing and taking pictures. Anyway, we tried to wake her up and she wouldn\u2019t wake up. My boyfriend tried to pick her up (she\u2019s maybe 165lbs) but said she was like dead weight and couldn\u2019t. At that point she screamed at him \u201cput me the fuck down!\u201d  I guess she had woken up briefly? But then she was unconscious again. This pissed my boyfriend off and he went off and started playing beer bong.\n\nAt this point the other girls at the party were getting catty and saying that we needed to leave. They said \u201cthis isn\u2019t a party and you weren\u2019t invited\u201d. I offered to stay the night, but the forced me to leave. \n\nI texted my friend as soon as I left and explained the situation. \n\nThe next morning, my friend calls me and says that she had been drugged. She took a drug test and there were barbiturates in her system. She was on antidepressants and claimed that she believed she died at some point due to the drug interaction. \n\nOver the next two weeks I barely hear from her. It\u2019s super weird. Then she texts me and really coldly says \u201c we need to talk\u201d. We met up for coffee and she basically said \u201cI can\u2019t be friends with someone who would leave me drugged and dying on the floor.\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t know she was drugged and I didn\u2019t know she was \u201cdying\u201d but she didn\u2019t care. She said regardless you don\u2019t leave a girl in that position. I told her the people forced me to leave and she said that I should have called 911 then. \n\nNothing I said turned her around and I got really upset she was listening to what the other girls at the party were saying happened over my words. I told her that when she was ready to apologize I\u2019d be here, but until then I guess we\u2019re not friends. \n\nAITAH", "created_utc": 1693234214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163o5y2/aitah_for_leaving_my_friend_passed_out_at_a_party/", "score": 664, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend is also a shitty person.\n\nShe doesn't need a \"friend\" like you.", "YTA. I wouldn't ever speak to you again.", "YTA. You probably should have called 911 when you saw how out of it she was. Her lack of responsiveness coupled with the drugs lying around everywhere should have been red flags that told you to call 911.", "I mean... were you technically responsible for a grown-ass woman?

It's dangerous to leave someone in that situation. It shouldn't matter if she's dying or not. You said people were already circling her and making comments, maybe she was even assaulted during the course of the night. If you couldn't move her, then call an ambulance to take her away.", "YTA - Jesus christ, you didn't just leave her passed out at a party (which, by the way, would still absolutely make you the AH), you left her at a party with rude sketchy people doing tons of drugs. Maybe no one was bothering her and she seemed safe enough when you were there, but what about a few hours later? When people are going to bed or passing out? Some drunk skeezy dude sees a passed out woman? The chances of sexual assault were astronomical.\n\nIf anyone should be apologizing, it should be you; huge, desperate apologies, even so she still might not accept them, which is totally understandable.", "YTA, there were people around her taking pictures and making comments, she was not in a safe environment. I wouldn\u2019t leave anyone in a position like that, let alone my \u201c best friend.\u201d The fact that you aren\u2019t on your knees begging her to forgive you means that you probably never were a good friend.", "YTA.

You should have called 911 as soon as you realized she wasn't waking up.", "YTA you left her, you weren't dragged out forced to leave you chose to leave under peer pressure, you should have called 911 if you felt so unsafe to stay there, even if she was just drunk and not drugged then that's still unsafe for her, you're not her friend", "Yta why would you literally just leave her there unconscious. Boyfriend could\u2019ve grabbed her arms and you get her feet, or you could\u2019ve asked the other people around if someone could help. Last option is the police, but leaving? Yeah no that\u2019s definitely a valid reason to never talk to you again.", "She doesn\u2019t owe you an apology for anything\u2026you left her in the most classic, dangerous position and think SHE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE??\n\nNo, she need a much better friend than you.\n\nYTA", "Ya uh you should have called the police if she was in that state.", "YTA and so is everyone else at that party who didn\u2019t call 911 when someone was passed out and not waking up when people tried.", "Yta.

Both you and your boyfriend. Your supposedly \"best friend\" of 10 years was passed out, people were laughing at her and taking photos of her and you just left her there? You didn't have the minimum decency to call 911/the police. She was drugged. The amount of women that get drugged and parties and assaulted is astounding. SHE is the one that deserves an apology, not you. I hope she cuts you off as a friend.", "YTA This is your best friend of ten years?

You should have taken her with you or called 911.", "NTA...", "YES YTA.\n\nReally? At your age you should know better than to leave your friend, clearly intoxicated, in a room full of strangers with open drug use.

What you did was wrong (you should have gotten her help), but you not knowing what to do would be somewhat forgivable. However, you should be apologizing to your friend, not the other way around. You are the asshole.", "YTA you left your former friend to die or be raped or whatever.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like an AH too.", "YTA. The thought that she got drugged and was going to get a train pulled on her didn't cross your mind.", "YTA\nLook you did what you could and felt was appropriate at the time. Would I have left a friend alone,  probably not but I'm definitely a worrier. You were also being thrown out of the house and with alcohol and drugs flying around it may not have been safe but in that case you definitely should have called authorities. But your friend thinking she died and is somehow still magically alive is a bit far fetched and she's blaming you for everything that happened that night.", "ESH. You definitely should have called 911 as soon as you realized you and BF alone couldn\u2019t help her. \n\nYour BF sucks for just giving up so easily. \n\nYour friend\u2019s friends suck because they didn\u2019t do anything to help either \n\nYour best friend suck the most imo because she put herself in that situation. I do think she\u2019s an asshole for choosing to go to this thing with clearly unreliable people around her, having no safety plan and expecting perfection in how people help her after she\u2019s passed out.", "ESH - you shouldn't have just left her there, especially if she wouldn't wake up.  At the same time though, your friend is 28.  She needs to take some accountability for her own actions here.  She chose to go to the party.  She chose to STAY at the party.", "NTa at all.", "NTA how were you supposed to know that she was drugged? You went out of your way to go to her and try and help her. If you were an asshole you would\u2019ve just ignored the text and went on with your date.", "NTA in any way\n\nyou tried to get her, she screamed at your BF when he tried to lift her, who seemed to have then gone off to enjoy himself. You didn't know she had taken drugs (willingly or not)\n\nIf she wants to remain friends she will apologise if not she won't. You need to have a word with your BF as well as he disappeared in to the party to enjoy himself.", "NTA she's a adult and can protect herself if she can't well she shouldnt be partying at all did you do the right thing for leaving her tho maybe not but you were forced out and like you said you didn't know she was drugged and maybe you could have been asleep too and all so I'm sorry you are not responsible of a other adult unless it's your kids she's your best friend yes but doesn't change the fact she couldn't protect herself as single bit of your best friend would have been a male everyone would have agreed that you did good to leave so nothing wrong here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She, on the other hand, does not owe you an apology for anything. It is frankly amazing that you think she does.\n\nYou left your friend in an extremely vulnerable and dangerous situation and went about your evening without a second thought. What if that had been you in that situation. Would you have been happy with the way it was handled? Would you want to be abandoned when you were in such a compromised situation that you were unconscious and unable to defend yourself against any inappropriate actions others may have committed upon you? Would you be angry at being left vulnerable to sexual assault. You would be fine with inappropriate photographs being taken of you, and possibly used for blackmail? Well, that is exactly what you did to your *best* friend. \n\nYour bf couldn't carry her, but that doesn't excuse you leaving her, nor does being 'told to leave'. You absolutely should have called 911, reported a medical emergency and requested an ambulance to attend. They would have transported her to the hospital and she would have been taken care of. Hospitals don't care if a patient is on drugs? They don't make judgments like that. Their mandate is to save lives and ensure the health and safety of their patients. \n\nYou and your boyfriend are both massive AHs. You don't leave a friend passed out at a party when they are obviously in an extremely vulnerable situation endangering both their health and safety. Your former *best* friend is much better off without someone as thoughtless and heartless as you. YTA.", "YTA. She's absolutely right, you should have called 911.", "Friend is right. The moment you saw just how inebriated she was and were forced by the hosts to leave, you should have called 911. Even before the drug stuff, she could have had alcohol poisoning.

It seems obvious that she'd taken something, willing or not. But ANYTHING could have happened to her.", "YTA. Your behavior is disgusting.", "I repeat what your friend said, that you should have called 911 then!! Why didn\u2019t you?? You had excuses for everything but conveniently didn\u2019t explain why you couldn\u2019t make a simple call. It literally would have costed you nothing. And you are clearly dismissing her health concerns by putting speech marks around \u201cdying\u201d, you still don\u2019t believe her and think she is over exaggerating but she has proof that she was drugged which is extremely dangerous. She could have easily overdosed or being hurt or raped. And you think she owes you an apology!? YTA", "Lot of YTA votes here, but only downvoted ESHs. Was no one else at the party an asshole? \n\nYour friend should not have gone to this party alone if there was not a single person there she could trust or was willing to really help her. Apparently she bares no responsibility for that, and it was OP\u2019s fault.\n\nIf no one had texted you to come get your friend, then you would not have even known she was there. She would have remained passed out and woken up there in the morning, so same exact outcome. Would OP still be the asshole then? \n\nA lot of folks saying an ambulance should be called, but if someone is cognizant enough to wake up and tell you to unhand them, then it\u2019s reasonable to assume they might not need an ambulance. Not to mention the huge financial burden an ambulance can cause in the US. It\u2019s not a cut and dry clear thing that OP should have without a doubt known she should call 911.\n\nOP is not running a rescue service, and this wasn\u2019t a party she was at or involved with. Would it have been heroic and kind-hearted for OP to be able to save the day? Of course. Is OP some huge asshole for not successfully maneuvering this tough situation that she was unexpectedly and unwillingly thrust into?

She wasn't mad at her co-workers or the other chicks at the party for allowing that to happen to her to begin with.

At that point she's publicly voided any consent he could claim to pick her up and remove her from the room.\n\nAt what point does their perception of her state override her ability to decline their offer? If he continued to put his hands on her, that would be a really bad scenario for him.\n\nWhich brings me to the point: The ONLY course of action would have been to call 911 for her, on her behalf. Expecting her and/or her boyfriend to take her to the ER is unrealistic at that point. The conversation should be why she didn't call 911, not why she didn't continue to violate established consent. \n\nAdditionally, INFO: Has she filed a police report?

It is daunting taking that many people to task and I didn't have cocaine as a worry but screw watching that happen to anyone, I just walked up to the host and very audibly asked for a blanket then went and covered her up before sitting down next to her until she woke up. \n\nRemonstrating would have caused a fight, I think quietly letting people know they'd get one if they pushed something that was wrong was actually a bit more sobering but that was a long and boring party. I  could see the ones who realised they'd gone too far, they couldn't look at me and I do think there's a sort of faceless crowd element to these things which makes it intimidating and hostile to be different. A couple tried shooting looks and I just met that with a smile and raised eyebrows, they're the ones who would have tried to get her home safely and that was not happening that night. If I can do that for a stranger then I think Y most definitely TA, a coward and not someone who should expect an apology because it's you who owes one. I would not have been able to live with myself had I let the situation I describe go on, I was scared what might happen but that doesn't give us a pass to be apathetic and especially not with people we're meant to care about.\n\nI worried I hadn't done enough, I did not know the girl and I didn't tell her what had happened, I didn't want to be the one to tell her that people had pictures of her or suggest she should watch her drinking because she was probably going to feel like utter crap about it when she found out. Maybe I bottled it there, I don't know, you bottled it completely with someone you had significantly more responsibility to and you view yourself as the victim in the situation, I'd be putting myself in her shoes if I was you", "YTA - and so is your boyfriend. \n\nYour received a call that said your best friend was so drunk that she was 'scared' and when you get there, she is being laughed at and photographed and because she drunkly 'yelled' at your boyfriend you both decide to leave her in a potentially dangerous situation while she is impared? \n\nShe could have been drugged, she could have been, potentially, experiencing alcohol poisoning or she could have been raped or taken advantage of and you and your boyfriend decide to leave her because she yelled at your boyfriend? \n\nYou don't leave a stranger in that kind of position and you certainly don't leave your best friend. \n\nI can't believe you then had the gall to ask HER for an apology when YOU literally left her in such a vulnerable position. \n\nYTA!", "YTA. Your left your friend in an incredibly unsafe and potentially deadly situation because people were being catty?? You should\u2019ve called the cops or ambulance rather than leave a friend.", "YTA\n\nYou left your \"best friend\" in a vulnerable position.  She could have been raped, videoed, killed.  \n\nYou and your boyfriend could have, together, carried her to the car.", "I don't need to read past the title. YTA", "My sister in Christ, I would have called for help for a stranger, nay, an enemy in that situation. YTA", "ESH, besides your ex-friend. why not at least call 211 or whatever the equivalent there is? The boss who hosted the party really should have been responsible.", "Esh. Bro I can\u2019t imagine going to a house and finding your drugged friend but not doing anything and her taking the side of the people who were there when she got drugged\u2026.", "YTA 10/10 No Notes", "YTA, big time. Not leaving people who are passed out alone in parties is basic. You left her in an extremely dangerous situation.", "Dude YTA you left her for dead??\n\nHow csn you even be asking this??? That whole situation is insane!!! Someone there made a desperate attempt to help her by using her phone to text you thinking \"what sane person wouldn't help!!!!\" \n\nAnd you left her!!!!\n\nYou left hwr unconscious on the floor with agitated obviously dangerous people\n \n\nYou're not just YTA you are actually a bad person. Like holy crap. This is the worst thing I have seen someone admit to on this sub", "You don't leave a person in this situation - especially a friend! \n\nSo many things could have happened here. \n\nYour boyfriend and you or someone else should have physically moved her into your car and gotten medical attention. Or call 911. No matter if things are intense/or you are annoyed you help this person. I'm not friends with certain friends I've been close with for years - I would not let that friendship collapse get in the way of not helping them? \n\n\"The other girls at the party\" - also why were they not helping?\n\nWhy would you be asking for an apology? \n\n*if see people passed out - help them! In college/parties - so many bad stories out there!", "YTA because the situation was dangerous. If I had been in your shoes, I would\u2019ve freaked out and called 911. So yeah your friend is in the right. It\u2019s bizarre it didn\u2019t occur to you to finish helping out; you really just said \u201cnever mind\u201d and left her in a horrible and scary situation.", "YTA. And I find it extremely hard to believe you're all in your late 20's-mid 30's. I'm subtracting 10 years because it's way more believable that you're all late teens to mid-20's. You all need to grow up and sober up.", "You definitely should have called 911. YTA", "YTA HEAVILY.", "What the fuck??? Would you want to be left there like that with people that clearly dont care abouy you passed out?", "YTA. If you can't wake someone who is intoxicated, you call 911. Even if she hadn't been drugged, alcohol poisoning can kill.", "YTA. On the plus side you and your boyfriend sound perfect for each other.", "YTA. If my best friend was passed out at a party, I'd drag her out by her nipples if I have to. She'd do the same for me. You left a vulnerable woman in a very dangerous situation and that's not ok.", "I wouldn't leave my female friend drunk at a party let alone passed out. YTA", "YTA as is your bf. You\u2019re made for each other", "YTA- your friend was unconscious and you left her there in a vulnerable position. \n\ntechnically you were invited to pick up your friend. They called you and gave you an address and let you in. So you had every right to be there.", "YTA.  Who would leave a total stranger passed out and possibly drugged at a party where people were laughing at and taking photographs of her, much less a friend? I call BS on the \"she was too heavy to pick up\"; two full-grown adults should be able to manage a normal sized woman like that, and you should have been willing to help him (Hint:  take the feet because that's the lighter end.)   You didn't need to know she was drugged or dying to help her--all you needed to know that she was incapacitated and unable to act in any way to protect herself from harm.  You knew she wasn't fully conscious, was unable to understand what was happening and STILL YOU LEFT HER.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say she yelled \"leave me alone\" because she didn't realize it was you trying to help her and thought it was another person touching her to do something bad to her.  (For perspective, it's exactly what an assault victim screamed at me when I was trying to put a tourniquet on her leg after she'd been gang-raped, stabbed 17 times, and left for dead in an alley.)  \n\nYour friend doesn't owe you an apology--YOU should be the one begging HER for forgiveness.  She didn't need to hear stories from the others at the party--all she needed to know was that she was in a dangerous situation, desperately needed help and that you refused to give it to her.", "Do you know who texted you to come?\n\nThe people asking you to leave likely intended to assault her. Someone drugged her.\n\nI get that you were thrown into this and didn't really know what was going on. Showing up at all was good on you. But abandoning her there was the worst possible decision you could've made. You texted her to explain why you left her to die or get assaulted, instead of calling 911 or doing *anything* to help her.\n\nIf you were afraid for your own safety (which is not an implication I'm getting), stepping outside and calling 911 is still an option. I would've simply called 911 right there, and then told everyone, \"The cops are on their way. All of y'all get the fuck out of here right now.\" If you don't want to do that, you can still threaten to call the cops if they don't help you move her to your car and drive her to the hospital. Like there are so many ways to get her out of there, and it becomes *more* important if the other assholes in that house want you out. \n\nYour friend was in trouble and you failed her. Hopefully nothing more happened that night, but she was left alone in a strange house with sketchy people who obviously had no interest in her safety.\n\nYTA", "Holy crapoly, yes YTA. Wow.\n\nETA: Shout out to the woman in Boston who called me an Uber, helped me into my house, left me a note with her name and number and made sure I was safe when I was drugged without my knowledge at a party in my early 20s and my friends (all men) left me while I waz coming in and out of consciousness in the basement & while surrounded by dozens of strangers. I had never met her before but to this day I shudder to think what would have happened to me without her kindness. We must protect eachother.", "YTA. Nothing in the world could tear me away from my best friend in much more favorable positions, let alone the one you described. And your bf is TA too. Be a better friend in the future and find a guy who cares about your friends.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI wouldn't leave my worst enemy in that situation.\n\nI can't even believe you have to ask. You know that was fucked up. \n\nGood for her for dumping a poor \"friend\"", "YTA.... And I don't understand how you wrote all that and still asked. \n\nIf you were in her position what would you have wanted to happen? I bet it's not to be left alone in a party where she is clearly surrounded by people who do not care for her. \n\nFirst off, You don't leave anyone unconscious at a party. They may puke and choke on it or might get SAed. No matter if it's a male or female, fri3dn or foe.  You just don't. \n\nSecond, this is your best friend, I would have been scared to death if I found my friend like this and was surrounded by people that were taking pictures of her and clearly not doing things in her best interest. They would have to get out of my way so I could get her out or I was calling the police on them. \n\nThird, I think your resentment towards your best friend clouded your judgement here and culminated with this. You should just be honest with yourself and if you don't want her as a BF then say it. But don't act holier than though at her when you literally left her abandoned at a party. \n\nAlso your boyfriend is as useful as a zero on the left side of a number.", "YTA, with friends like you who needs enemies. If your friend is on drugs and isn\u2019t waking up, you call 911!", "First, she's an idiot and doesn't value her life. Second, but your were tapped to help, so you fucked up there.  You help and yell at assholes later. Your an asshole, but not the only one here", "YTA, you have to be an adult. Think clearly, a human is in trouble, people are being as\\*holes, and you should help that person, ESPECIALLY if they are incoherent or belligerent.\n\nBe better, grow up.\n\nYour boyfriend is even worse, the two of you combined make for something even less than human. You could not carry her together? ask for help? so much wrong here", "Yes, YTA. Would you be ok if she did this to you?", "YTA", "YTA- I\u2019ve done more for strangers let alone my best friend.", "YTA. WTF is wrong with you and your boyfriend? What kind of grown-ass dude is ditching a girl who isn\u2019t fully waking up at a party like that? She wasn\u2019t SAFE and you just left her like that!!! \n\nYou\u2019re an absolutely horrific excuse for a friend and you should be ashamed of yourself. I hope you\u2019re not ever in charge of a vulnerable person/animal/living breathing thing because you are heartless.", "YTA\n\nYour supposed friend was mostly unresponsive at a party with drugs in the open. People were taking pictures of her. You decide because she said something while under the influence to just leave her behind. THEN when the people at the party say you were not invited you just leave your friend behind instead of calling 911. If it were MY friend I would have called 911 immediately instead of abandoning my friend to a group of people already making fun of her. All you had to do was say \"If you do not let me get my friend out of here I will call the police right away\".  You probably will ignore the judgment but you are not a good friend. Justify it all you like but just think about if it happened to you.", "YTA. Nope. Never. No matter how much of an AH she is being when you are trying to help her. When those girls told you that you had to leave, I would\u2019ve said fine. Let me call 911 first so I can get some help for my friend. So I can get her home. I think really quickly they would\u2019ve helped you get her in a car. \nYou NEVER leave someone behind. \n(And I\u2019m 55 and my partying days, at least like that, are long over).\nYou owe her an apology. And that BF of yours? I would be giving him the side eye at this point.", "Yta. You should have called an ambulance.", "YTA, look its not your fault she got into that situation. But as soon as you were physically there. You should have done everything in your power to get her out. If your boyfriend couldn't lift her you should've asked people for help getting her out. And like other people said if nobody would then call the police. \n\nIf this was a common occurrence I would understand ignoring the call. You can only do so much. But you make no mention of that so I doubt it is.   \nYou even saw there were drugs present and gave no thought to she may have been slipped something. \n\nNah, you left her in an unsafe situation I don't blame her at all for cutting you off. Your boyfriend also sounds like a treat.", "100% YATA", "Yeah, YTA your friend is right. If you couldn\u2019t move her and others were forcing you to leave, call an ambulance or call the police", "You and your bf are both big YTA you left your friend in an unsafe environment where anything could of happened to her and she might not of been alive to hate u for it. Regardless of what the other people said in the party I would of stayed and made sure she was alright and got her home safely and stayed with her", "YTA. Hell, you're a mega asshole!\n\nThat's fucked as hell, and honestly ya'll are too old to be in those situations AND be this clueless about what to do. But you clearly don't give a fuck about your \"friend\" so idk why you're even on here asking about this - or why you went when you got the text to begin with. \n\nYour boyfriend is a massive prick too. And 35 going, \"Fuck helping this clearly fucked up chick that is my girl's best friend, I'mma go play beer pong.\"?! Yeah, real keeper ya got there. XD", "If she had died, or been raped, you would\u2019ve felt very guilty. \n\nI understand that you weren\u2019t even at the party or in any way responsible for her, and that you went to \u201ctry\u201d to help her, but yes, YTA in this situation. \n\nWhen it comes to safety, particularly the safety of women, friendship aside, you do the right thing every single time. It doesn\u2019t matter how heavy they are or whatever else may be inconvenient. I would\u2019ve helped her and she\u2019s a stranger to me. We have a moral obligation as people and as women to look out for one another. \n\nShe\u2019s lucky to be alive and well. Frankly you should be glad nothing worse happened.", "Yeah YTA. And your \u201cex friend\u201d just got out of a terrible friendship. I wouldn\u2019t even leave a stranger passed out at a party surrounded by \u201cCaty\u201d women who are laughing and filming her. Let alone my friend of a decade. You need to stop and access your own morality.", "Even if they made you leave, you should\u2019ve gotten in the car, called 911 immediately and waited for them to arrive at the very least. She could have been raped or OD, and you were able to see she was not in an okay state, YTA.", "YTA\n\nDont hold your breath waiting for the apology.", "INFO. Why did they call you? Are you her ICE contact?", "ESH. I feel like there are a lot of plot holes here. Who texted you to come get her? Did no one fess up to texting you? They should have been on hand to help once you got there. Everyone at the party sucks, but obviously she knows these people, or at least some of them. I don't know that you bear 100% of the responsibility, but the buck has to stop with someone.", "Sorry, but YTA. She\u2019s right\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have left anyone, much less your BEST FRIEND in that position!", "Holy shit. I would never speak to you again. YTA.", "ESH.\n\nEveryone in this story needs to figure their dumpster-fire lives out before someone dies.", "YTA! An absolute terrible friend who cannot be trusted. I\u2019m actually appalled you could think your nta. Doesn\u2019t matter if she blackout drunk or drugged. Your friend needed help and you abandoned her. That makes you a bad friend. I\u2019m glad your ex friend got out when she did because she is not safe having people like you in her life.", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t be friends with you either. 9-1-1 is a thing in most countries. \n\nYou left her completely vulnerable and alone and defenceless because she annoyed your boyfriend. And whether they asked you to leave or not, there were other ways to keep her safe. \n\nI hope you\u2019re never in the same situation your friend was.", "YTA Always err on the side of safety. NEVER leave anyone (friend or not) who is unconscious.", "Yta, and too old for this kind of shit.", "How would you have felt if the next day her mom had called to tell you she was found raped (and killed) by the road? Because that is what happens. You\u2019re drugged, you\u2019re raped and dumped. YTA and your boyfriend is an asshole as well.", "You should have called 911.", "YTA.  And no friend.", "YTA - especially since you think she owes you an apology lol", "YTA Why didn't you get people to at least help you get her out of the house? You left someone you consider a friend unconscious in a house filled with drunk strangers. She could've been r+ped, kidnapped, or yes died from the alcohol and drugs in her system. Last resort was 911 and you didn't even do that. \n\nIf this is how you treat friends I don't wanna know how you treat strangers.", "Yta, shoulda called someone", "[removed]", "YTA.  You should have carried her out and taken her home.  She might have been raped, for all you know.", "YTA. Not cool at all to leave someone in a dangerous situation. Your BF is the asshole too.", "YTA", "YTA.  Passed out on the floor, unable to wake up, people making fun of her.  You messed up, should have called 911.  Who knows what else happened after you left.  Your Bf is an a-hole too.", "ESH", "You're the one who needs to apologize because you're a shitty friend. Yta", "YTA. If you can\u2019t move her, you get help. Call a freaking ambulance if you have to. You do not leave someone like this, period. How would you feel knowing someone had left you incapacitated like this? She has no way of knowing what happened or what may have been done to her. Wtf kind of person are you??", " Absolutely YTA.  The only reasonable response would have been to call 911 and stay with her or near her until she was safely onboard the ambulance.", "YTA. You and everyone at that party that didn\u2019t get her help is the AH. She was unconscious and compromised. Next time call emt\u2019s cause they don\u2019t give a shit that there is drugs or alcohol, they are just there to help.", "YTA if any of my friends or family were unconscious at a strange place with drugs, alcohol and people crowding around and taking photos I'd be calling the emergency services. I'd do it for a stranger too. Most people would... What on earth is wrong with you? How would you have felt in the inverse situation? Also she likely screamed to put her down as she had no idea who it was carrying her as she was intoxicated. She was likely  frightened. You and your bf need to apologise but with the expectation that she may not forgive you.", "YTA. \n\nI think you seriously misread the situation at the party and needed to get her out of it. \nIs this nornal behaviour from her? Or that she is at a party where there is a lot of drugs gping around?\nBecause it sounds you were either tired of her antics or not attuned to what was going on.", "I don\u2019t even need to read the post to know that YTA. If someone is unconscious why the heck would you leave!! Call them a taxi, an Uber, get them home safe. Since when has it ever been acceptable to leave someone passed out all alone. That is totally dangerous and a. It if a dick move. Especially when the person is your friend.", "YTA you failed the basic friend test. Don\u2019t listen to an inebriated person to go away when it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve had too much and are with untrustworthy people. If you have to you call emergency services. Boyfriend should\u2019ve just kept picking her up and both of you should\u2019ve transported her into a car and into emergency.\n\nBetter to get her mad over that then something else like dying or being raped or both.", "YTA.  You NEVER leave a friend in that kind of condition and especially in that kind of environment.  Your boyfriend sounds like a real piece of work too.  A real man wouldn't leave a woman in that kind of danger.", "Where does she work? You said this was a after work, work party?", "OP needs to make an emergency plan for getting help when she is with her boyfriend. The minute helping her requires that he exert some effort, he will be off to play beer pong. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the FIRST time.", "Really? I've had so MANY friends that passed out and were as fine as can be afterwards. I've never seen anyone drive to the ER, we just keep an eye on the friend and make sure they are ok and comfy until they wake up \ud83d\ude42 I didn't know it was a thing to call an ambulance in those situations, maybe it's bad that i never heard of it? Is it a common thing?", "Always get them out.\n\nOnce in high school I got a call in the middle of the night from a girl in one of my science classes. By I got a call, I mean my parents land line with a phone by their bed went off and a girl I sometimes did labs with was on the other end begging for me. She was at a party locked in a bathroom. She'd stolen a phone (flip phones were a new thing) and the post-it with my number was the only thing she had. She was sure she was drugged and needed help. I told my mom a girl from school was in trouble, could I use the car? Mom said ok, but do you know where you are driving? I thought I had a good idea. Ok, but if someone's hurt her take her to the hospital and call me from there. Ok Mom. \n\nGot there. Took a couple of other girls from the party with me to convince her to open the door and let me drive her away. She was soooo high! But the paranoia hit her before anything else happened and she locked herself away. I got her out. Bought her a gas station hot dog and water. Double checked with her that no one had hurt her and asked what she wanted, hospital to check for rape drugs or home? She wanted home. I took her there and she was better looking by the time I dropped her off. We never spoke about it ever. I never had to evacuate another person, but apparently my home number got passed around to other girls that if a date went bad or if they were SA'd I was the gal to call. I'm only a 5'2\" frizzy hair blonde, but I must have stepped into that party space like the Terminator with no fucks to give.\n\nIf 17 year old unpopular me could walk into the cool kids turf and get three other kids to help evacuate a terrified teen, you and your weak sauce BF could have gotten her out. He wanted beer pong and you didn't care that harpies were gloating over a friend's unconscious body so you let them bully you out. I hope she gets away from toxic people like them and finds more courageous people than you are. And you need a better BF too. He seems to think whatever happens to an unconscious woman's body is her problem even if he could do something to keep it from getting worse. Wouldn't trust him after this.", "Already surrounded by nasty people taking pictures of her\u2026 I agree even if it were a perfect stranger I\u2019d have called 911 before leaving her in that situation.", "Especially with people standing around her laughing and taking pictures. How did that NOT set off alarm bells in op's head? I really hope she wasn't assaulted, well more than she was when she was drugged...YTA, op. Some friend you are.", "Absolutely YTA, OP. You say you didn't know she was drugged, so let's go with your assumption that she drank too much. Even then, you left her incapacitated in a room full of drug-fueled, relative strangers, where she could've potentially 1) choked on her own vomit 2) been raped 3) died of alcohol poisoning. If you're a friend, then I'm not sure what an enemy is. Would your attitude be different if you found out later she died?

It\u2019s easy for everyone not in the situation to look back later and say their strong thoughts.", "Who said anything about calling the police?

She could have been raped (I mean she may have been already- if she found out, I doubt she would have told OP)", "She was drugged and just woke up from being passed out, she probably was delusional and didn't understand what was happening in the moment and all she knew was that a random man was picking her up and she panicked", "Responsible for getting drugged??", "She had been really depressed and had to move back home with her parents after living in another state for school.

It is WILD to me that anyone would leave a clearly messed up friend at a party in light of the hyper-aware and protective behaviors that I've learned from my mother and women around me about how to protect one another...
