Over the past 6 months our friendship has been a little tense, we\u2019ve been fighting more which is really unlike us, and there\u2019s been a distance between us. \n\nA few weeks ago my friend went to a work party after work at her bosses house. At about 11p at night, I get a text from her phone that says \u201cyou\u2019re friend got too drunk. She\u2019s fine just really scared and you need to come pick her up.\u201d I was on a date with my boyfriend (35m) at the time but we stopped our date and drove to the house. \n\nWhen we got there there were tons of people and drugs everywhere. (Cocaine, etc). They led me to a room where she was passed out. There were people all around her and some were laughing and taking pictures. Anyway, we tried to wake her up and she wouldn\u2019t wake up. My boyfriend tried to pick her up (she\u2019s maybe 165lbs) but said she was like dead weight and couldn\u2019t. At that point she screamed at him \u201cput me the fuck down!\u201d  I guess she had woken up briefly? But then she was unconscious again. This pissed my boyfriend off and he went off and started playing beer bong.\n\nAt this point the other girls at the party were getting catty and saying that we needed to leave. They said \u201cthis isn\u2019t a party and you weren\u2019t invited\u201d. I offered to stay the night, but the forced me to leave. \n\nI texted my friend as soon as I left and explained the situation. \n\nThe next morning, my friend calls me and says that she had been drugged. She took a drug test and there were barbiturates in her system. She was on antidepressants and claimed that she believed she died at some point due to the drug interaction. \n\nOver the next two weeks I barely hear from her. It\u2019s super weird. Then she texts me and really coldly says \u201c we need to talk\u201d. We met up for coffee and she basically said \u201cI can\u2019t be friends with someone who would leave me drugged and dying on the floor.\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t know she was drugged and I didn\u2019t know she was \u201cdying\u201d but she didn\u2019t care. She said regardless you don\u2019t leave a girl in that position. I told her the people forced me to leave and she said that I should have called 911 then. \n\nNothing I said turned her around and I got really upset she was listening to what the other girls at the party were saying happened over my words. I told her that when she was ready to apologize I\u2019d be here, but until then I guess we\u2019re not friends. \n\nAITAH", "created_utc": 1693234214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163o5y2/aitah_for_leaving_my_friend_passed_out_at_a_party/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As soon as you found her in that state, especially not waking up, you should have only had two choices - call an ambulance or drive her to an ER.", "YTA. \n\n> There were people all around her and some were laughing and taking pictures.\n\nYou left her alone like this? What is wrong with you?\n\n> This pissed my boyfriend off and he went off and started playing beer bong.\n\nYou and your boyfriend are a great match. You're a shitty friend. Your boyfriend is also a shitty person.\n\nShe doesn't need a \"friend\" like you.", "YTA. I wouldn't ever speak to you again.", "YTA. You probably should have called 911 when you saw how out of it she was. Her lack of responsiveness coupled with the drugs lying around everywhere should have been red flags that told you to call 911.", "I mean... were you technically responsible for a grown-ass woman?  Nope.  Were you kinda maybe a little *morally* responsible to make sure your \"best friend\" didn't die of an overdose?  Yeah.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Even if she hadn't been drugged and drank herself into oblivion, you were called to come get her (why didn't you tell the people telling you to leave that?) and you did show up. It's dangerous to leave someone in that situation. It shouldn't matter if she's dying or not. You said people were already circling her and making comments, maybe she was even assaulted during the course of the night. If you couldn't move her, then call an ambulance to take her away.", "YTA - Jesus christ, you didn't just leave her passed out at a party (which, by the way, would still absolutely make you the AH), you left her at a party with rude sketchy people doing tons of drugs. Maybe no one was bothering her and she seemed safe enough when you were there, but what about a few hours later? When people are going to bed or passing out? Some drunk skeezy dude sees a passed out woman? The chances of sexual assault were astronomical.\n\nIf anyone should be apologizing, it should be you; huge, desperate apologies, even so she still might not accept them, which is totally understandable.", "YTA, there were people around her taking pictures and making comments, she was not in a safe environment. I wouldn\u2019t leave anyone in a position like that, let alone my \u201c best friend.\u201d The fact that you aren\u2019t on your knees begging her to forgive you means that you probably never were a good friend.", "YTA. No matter if it's a stranger or a friend, you don't leave a drugged person without providing help. You should have called 911 as soon as you realized she wasn't waking up.", "YTA you left her, you weren't dragged out forced to leave you chose to leave under peer pressure, you should have called 911 if you felt so unsafe to stay there, even if she was just drunk and not drugged then that's still unsafe for her, you're not her friend", "Yta why would you literally just leave her there unconscious. Boyfriend could\u2019ve grabbed her arms and you get her feet, or you could\u2019ve asked the other people around if someone could help. Last option is the police, but leaving? Yeah no that\u2019s definitely a valid reason to never talk to you again.", "She doesn\u2019t owe you an apology for anything\u2026you left her in the most classic, dangerous position and think SHE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE??\n\nNo, she need a much better friend than you.\n\nYTA", "Ya uh you should have called the police if she was in that state.", "YTA and so is everyone else at that party who didn\u2019t call 911 when someone was passed out and not waking up when people tried.", "Yta. Damn you suck", "Soft YTA. While it's not your responsibility to take care of her, you saw the position she was in and the drugs there. You \"didn't know she was drugged\" but saw all the drugs there. With how bad she was, you should've called 911.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t a safe situation to leave her in.", "YTA It was clearly an incredibly unsafe situation. You should have called 911 if you really could not move her.", "YTA 10000%! Both you and your boyfriend. Your supposedly \"best friend\" of 10 years was passed out, people were laughing at her and taking photos of her and you just left her there? You didn't have the minimum decency to call 911/the police. She was drugged. The amount of women that get drugged and parties and assaulted is astounding. SHE is the one that deserves an apology, not you. I hope she cuts you off as a friend.", "YTA This is your best friend of ten years? I would have tried harder for a complete stranger.", "yta. you walked into a room where your friend was passed out and people were gathered, laughing and taking pictures and you thought \u201cthis is safe for her tonight\u201d???? horrible friend", "YTA. You should have taken her with you or called 911.", "NTA...", "YES YTA.\n\nReally? At your age you should know better than to leave your friend, clearly intoxicated, in a room full of strangers with open drug use. This is how people end up dead and I think she was very brave and truthfully a little too nice to you to say that she couldn't be your friend.", "YTA\n\nOnly one person lost a friend that day and that was you. There's no way I'm leaving a friend in that kind of situation.", "YTA.  Plain and simple- can\u2019t trust you.", "YES YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE", "YTA. What you did was wrong (you should have gotten her help), but you not knowing what to do would be somewhat forgivable. However, you should be apologizing to your friend, not the other way around. You are the asshole.", "YTA you left your former friend to die or be raped or whatever.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like an AH too.", "YTA. The thought that she got drugged and was going to get a train pulled on her didn't cross your mind.", "YTA\nLook you did what you could and felt was appropriate at the time. Would I have left a friend alone,  probably not but I'm definitely a worrier. You were also being thrown out of the house and with alcohol and drugs flying around it may not have been safe but in that case you definitely should have called authorities. But your friend thinking she died and is somehow still magically alive is a bit far fetched and she's blaming you for everything that happened that night.", "ESH. You definitely should have called 911 as soon as you realized you and BF alone couldn\u2019t help her. \n\nYour BF sucks for just giving up so easily. \n\nYour friend\u2019s friends suck because they didn\u2019t do anything to help either \n\nYour best friend suck the most imo because she put herself in that situation. I do think she\u2019s an asshole for choosing to go to this thing with clearly unreliable people around her, having no safety plan and expecting perfection in how people help her after she\u2019s passed out.", "ESH - you shouldn't have just left her there, especially if she wouldn't wake up.  At the same time though, your friend is 28.  She needs to take some accountability for her own actions here.  She chose to go to the party.  She chose to STAY at the party.", "NTa at all.", "NTA how were you supposed to know that she was drugged? You went out of your way to go to her and try and help her. If you were an asshole you would\u2019ve just ignored the text and went on with your date.", "NTA in any way\n\nyou tried to get her, she screamed at your BF when he tried to lift her, who seemed to have then gone off to enjoy himself. You didn't know she had taken drugs (willingly or not)\n\nIf she wants to remain friends she will apologise if not she won't. You need to have a word with your BF as well as he disappeared in to the party to enjoy himself.", "NTA she's a adult and can protect herself if she can't well she shouldnt be partying at all did you do the right thing for leaving her tho maybe not but you were forced out and like you said you didn't know she was drugged and maybe you could have been asleep too and all so I'm sorry you are not responsible of a other adult unless it's your kids she's your best friend yes but doesn't change the fact she couldn't protect herself as single bit of your best friend would have been a male everyone would have agreed that you did good to leave so nothing wrong here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
