I (17f) shared a small room with my sister (13f) and didn\u2018t complain. When the renovations were done my parents gave all three of us (my brother, sister and I) a budget to furnish, paint, etc our rooms exactly how we wanted them. I flipped a coin and got the biggest room. I wanted a dark-academia themed room so I thrifted, sanded, stained and varnished each piece of furniture and decorated everything, it took me two months in total.\n\nMy cousin is 11 years old, let\u2019s call her Ashi. We have a guest bedroom but her parents and sister (Anna) were using it. I allowed her to sleep in my room with and she loves it (she\u2018s a huge Harry Potter nerd), within two hours, she had managed to shatter my silver-framed mirror and knock over my bookshelf. I was pissed but I couldn\u2018t really do anything but tell her parents. Throughout the week she broke several other small items as well. I understand Ashi is growing into her taller body but I nearly lost it when she broke my vintage pocketwatch. It was given to me by my ex-girlfriend who moved away, we chose not to go long-distance and I cherished it.\n\nNow, my cousins are coming over to stay again. My parents want Ashi to stay in my room again because the younger one is very little and my room\u2018s dark theme would give her nightmares (she\u2018s 4). I refused, I didn\u2018t want her to break anything again. My parents just told me to get over it and explain to her to not touch my things. I had already done that previously, in both a nice and stern way. I even told her parents but she didn\u2019t listen to them. I said that she could just sleep in the living room, on the couch. She started crying and blubbering about how she loved my room so much and that I was being unfair. My parents hate confrontation and crying children, so they tried to convince me to let her stay, I didn\u2018t budge. In the end, she ended up sleeping in my sister\u2018s room. She hated it because it was brightly lit and she couldn\u2019t sleep. My sister got mad, told her to get over it and gave her a sleep mask (it was 35C). \n\nMy cousin\u2018s family left as Ashi was getting crabby from the lack of sleep, opting to go to a hotel instead. Ashi\u2019s mother was on my side but her dad thought I was being ridiculous, calling me spoilt. My grandmother wanted to have one final Christmas together before my other uncle got married, and is mad at me for \u2018breaking her family apart.\u2019 I kinda get it, and I regret that my Grandma\u2018s time was ruined but I don\u2018t regret my decision at all. She\u2019s been having a hard time ever since my Grandpa died and I tried to make it up to her by baking cookies. My grandma refused my apology and took me off her Will (I don\u2018t mind, she would\u2019ve taken me off it when she found out I\u2018m a lesbian anyway) but my Dad\u2019s making a big deal about it, he wants me to apologise.

If you were being selfish or unreasonable in your reasoning, I would agree that you are spoiled.\n\n**You aren't, though.**\n\nYou freely shared your space previously. The child inconsideratly destroyed a lot of your things. One thing is an accident.  This was at best neglect and, at worst, deliberate. There seems to have been very few consequences for her, and I can't help but notice you don't mention your aunt and uncle paying for your broken things.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso, wow, grandma is a petty controling garbage person.

Good for you for standing your ground!", "NTA -  - and WOW does your family have some vendetta issues! I'm so sorry that they feel like, as adults, they have to retaliate against a kid bc their feelings got hurt. That is ridiculous. Taking you out of the will bc your 11yo cousin doesn't get to sleep where she wants... ffs.\n\nYour room is your room, period. And clumsy is one thing, but you don't just bump a pocketwatch off a nightstand and it breaks.

At best, that'd just mean Ashi can't share rooms with you until she's done growing and can expected to not break your things from there on out. At worst, it's just a BS excuse. If someone is genuinely clumsy, and honestly can't help themselves from breaking things, does that mean we should therefor allow them to go ahead and break our valuables? The same is true for little kids. Should you just let them break your stuff because they're little and \"can't help it\"? Of course not!

Since I will get condemnation either way, I choose the path where I get condemnation and no broken items.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong and shouldn't apologize.

However, seeing things from other people's perspective does not also require to see their behavior and choices as acceptable.\n\nSeeing things from other people's perspective is an exercise in trying to appreciate WHY someone did what they did or thinks what they think, and understanding that why can help you do various things - like apologize, forgive, help, advocate and so on, where you might not have before. \n\nYou've done a good job having empathy for your grandma's struggle with the death of your grandpa, and appreciating that she's sensitive to family discord. That does not mean how she chooses to handle that sensitivity is acceptable. It's also understandable that it would be uncomfortable and maybe even hurt a bit for your aunt and uncle to pay $250 (at least) to get your watch fixed - but neither they nor their child have had to take any responsibility for her destruction, not even to the extent of expressing feeling bad that your things have been ruined bc of their family. If she had broken these things at a stranger's house or in a store, they would be required to compensate for that damage, and I'm sure they would have figured something out to pay for it. Which means they could do the same for you. The fact that they're not even trying, that they blame you for \"making\" them get a hotel (funny, where'd the money for that come from?), and letting your grandma continue to fault you for protecting yourself from their daughter means they are fully taking advantage of you being A) family and B) a kid. Looking at it from their shoes doesn't change one iota that they are behaving like AHs.", "Be careful with this.

My Uncle and Grandma blame me and my Grandma is paying for their hotel, it\u2019s kinda cheap because it\u2019s not very nice, three stars.", "Yeah, it\u2019s just difficult. Thanks for the advice though!", "I\u2019ll keep that in mihe, thanks!", "Please know you are not the reason any of the fall out happened. Their immaturity is causing this. There's no need to take responsibility for adults creating drama and shame on them for even hinting that you're to blame."]}
