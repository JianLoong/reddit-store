I said OP isn't an asshole for not wanting to train her, but none of us are in the position to judge whether she's putting her head in a fume hood because OP hasn't been trained to teach people and especially has no experience with her disability has no idea how to communicate \"don't do that it's not safe\" in a way that will get through to her, or if she's actually incapable of learning how to be safe in this environment. We don't know enough to judge if any \"babysitting\" is necessary or if it's only turned out this way due to OP's failure at training her. (A failure which, yeah, it's OP's fault-- don't get me wrong!)

I was fine with the idea of someone just watching what I do on a daily basis and maybe lending a hand with the more mundane tasks, however I also have to do far more, including accompanying her to lunch to make sure she eats her food and can heat it up, I have to accompany her to the bathroom (I wait outside of course) to make sure she's okay.  \nI think you're correct in saying that I hold resentment for this situation, but it's not her fault.

In a chemistry lab, putting the wrong things together, or even putting the right things together in the wrong order, can have disastrous results. She could create something toxic and gas the lab with it, or accidentally mix something explosive, or any number of things. I feel for her but it's way too dangerous.", "This.", "Especially where it sounds like this is a government disability aid agency they're dealing with, which I'm sure adds some extra tangles to the liability issues.", "I had to sit through a COSHH lecture when starting in Poundland because they sell caustic soda. Id have assumed that it would be far more intense in a lab setting", "And that is what you should list in your  report. Write down all of the safety violations that she has done, and that she\u2019s putting everyone in the room with her at risk. Mention the legal ramification especially since she\u2019s not being supervised by someone with professional training. While inclusion and  opportunities is great, not everyone is suited for every profession. Don\u2019t focus on how frustrating it is to work with her, or how frustrating her disability could be. Focus on the facts.", "Why would it be illegal? I mean, I don't assume they can force OP to agree to do any of this, but it sounds like OP was ok with this at first.", "They have no training in this. Of course they \"should\" have, but they're chemists, not disability specialists.", "NTA. Sometimes trying their best isn\u2019t enough because of dangers in the work place and yours are fairly serious along with mixing things up that shouldn\u2019t be and wouldn\u2019t be if she was able to learn the job.

NTA.\n\nYou have a high-responsibility, high-safety job and nobody should be in there with you that a. isn't trained properly and b. can effectively and consistently stick to that training. Maybe there's a kid at the group who CAN do that, but clearly you didn't land them. It's not safe for her, or for you, and it's ALSO putting (not sure what kind of testing you do, but I'm assuming) patient care at risk.\n\nPlease, get her reassigned as soon as you possibly can, for her own safety, yours and that of every patient whose samples go through your lab.", "OP I\u2019m a \u201cJane\u201d.

That sounds unhelpful to both OP and Jane", "NTA - I worked as a social worker with individuals with intellectual disabilities and I\u2019m surprised by this. The individuals I served often did job shadowing, however they always had a job coach with them to assist with the tasks that you are helping with. It is extremely inappropriate for your work to be asking you to accompany Jane to the bathroom. You not being asked is also really surprising. Think of it from a liability standpoint, if Jane did accidentally create toxic fumes and she got injured, you could potentially be liable because they are putting her in your care. This is doing a disservice to Jane as well because she hasn\u2019t had the training to ensure she is following proper safety precautions. Honestly, if you are in the US I can only imagine what a call to OSHA would result in. I also have a lot of questions regarding whether they have put her on payroll or if they are attempting to classify it as \u201cvolunteer work.\u201d All job shadowing positions I\u2019ve seen the individual was getting paid as well because they are assisting with the tasks. That also puts the individual under the company insurance in the event of an accident. \n\nGiven the nature of work, I would honestly say that to the supervisors your focus needs to be 100% on your work to ensure that quality and safety standards are met. Personally, I would be very honest and say that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the nature of the work and there was nearly a major incident. I would also encourage a job coach be with her to assist in the other tasks and ask Jane what other areas she might like touring at the facility.", "No offense, but if Jane\u2019s presence in the lab serves only as a detriment because she\u2019s incapable of doing basic functions without being babied, then this is not the right job for her. Can someone always be there to help do Jane\u2019s job and make sure she only ever works with safe chemicals? Is that even feasible in a lab setting?", "It sounds like OP is being forced to work through lunch if she has to monitor someone else the whole time.", "NTA\n\nGet her reassigned before she gets hurt (even more than pricked by syringe and inhaling toxic fumes)!", "NTA. She is putting herself and others in danger, it sounds dramatic but you could be saving a life (or at least be saving someone from grievous bodily harm) by speaking up. As said by others, you don\u2019t need to frame it around her disability and you can just generally note your concerns surrounding her competency. It was negligent not only to have you working with someone you weren\u2019t trained to work with but also to have her in that environment in the first place considering she seems to prove to be at high risk of injuring someone or herself, this is not even mentioning that it doesn\u2019t fare well for her accurately completing tasks. None of this is to diss her\u2014I doubt I have the accuracy to preform lab work, I\u2019m just very confused as to why they basically dropped her into your lap when she clearly shouldn\u2019t even be in that environment.", "NTA. If her safety and lab safety are being compromised despite instructions being given, you really have no choice but to go to the safety officer or your supervisor. Make sure you leave a paper trail of documentation so that it is apparent that you're not simply opposed to her presence, but rather to the consequences of her actions.", "Clearly NTA (see other comments) but why on earth would they put someone with her particular disabilities in a science lab of all places? You have to be a high functioning sort of person to be in there and not have things go horribly wrong. Do they want to set people up for failure?\nOf course I understand there are disabled people who could handle such a job just fine, but clearly this girl isn't one of them, and somebody knew that and sent her in anyway.", "NTA - You were not asked or trained to do this and obviously she was not given any kind of safety training. It seems like no thought was given as to how to structure the program. I hope no one gets hurt. \n\nAs a person who has supervised teams, I do agree you need to document the issues in a neutral way and go to your supervisor. I would suggest that a meeting with your supervisor, you and a representative of the organization take place so that expectations can be clearly defined.", "NTA. But don't lead with reassigning. Tell the supervisor that you are struggling to maintain a safe working environment for her and the rest of your team and you need help.", "NTA\n\nYour organisations have put both of you in a situation you are not prepared or trained for (her in a lab, you in a mentoring role to someone with a disability). Neither you or Jane have done anything wrong, but if something goes badly wrong the consequences will fall on Jane and potentially others around her. Plus she deserves a chance to succeed rather than having been set up to fail. \n\nThis is entirely the fault of your supervisors, and they NEED to be made aware of the fact that people are at risk because of the situation you created. In fact in most countries you would be liable, and in all countries you would be T A if you fail to report the safety issues and the stress this is creating.", "I see a lot of comments talking about how you should approach this in a \"nicer manner\", this is wrong. Your job is having you take up roles you are not trained for or not approached about. The company wants you to do something which only will get it a tax bonus for. This is uncalled for. Don't take the nice route. They are forcing you to take up something that will only benefit them. She is endangering herself and putting you liable for things you didn't sign up for. Either you tell them that you are not the punching bag, or you start looking into other options. Don't let them treat you like this.", "NTA it's you don't have the patience needed to help her, its good that you're self aware enough to know this isn't the right fit for you. \n\nYou even attempted to resolve the issues you had with her. Please also explain it's not anything to do with who she is (you've even said shes a lovely girl), and you really want her to succeed in this field and you don't know if you're the best to teach her.", "NTA. But before reaching out to your supervisor reach out to HR. I\u2019ve been in this situation before at work and my supervisor, while great, also really didn\u2019t know what to do either and ended up reaching out to HR.", "Also, OP can recommend redesigning workplace and improvised labelling system to accommodate Jane better as well as request additional personnel to supervise Jane so that he can focus on his own work", "Perfect answer!", "She\u2019s a bad fit for the job. It happens. It needs to be dealt with kindly and compassionately.", "Email this as well. You need to have a record of this as a safety concern that you raised through the appropriate channels. Print out a copy of the email as well. \n\nThis is a 'cover your ass' type of situation if I ever heard of one.\n\nIt's awesome that there's a program to help with work experience, but this might not be the best environment for this particular individual.", "This. Disabled or not, this job isn't a good fit for her. I'm sure the program can find another workplace where her enthusiasm would be helpful instead of a liability. NTA", "I feel for you. This is my third time recovering from Covid, and my immediate short term memory is completely shot. I used to have no issue doing long division in my head, but now I struggle doing basic math because numbers I\u2019m not actively looking at just disappear from my mind. I can barely read anything important, because my reading comprehension is terrible. I forget whatever the passage is about and completely lose my train of thought.

You've tried directing her on the safety protocols of the laboratory. At this point, you may want to even reach out to the organization that coordinated her position. Start tracking the mistakes she's making and why they are dangerous. And stop being gentle. She needs to know the severity of what she is doing, and she won't know unless you really spell it out for her. She obviously cannot be objective about your criticisms, and that is a detriment to the safety of the lab. Stop redirecting and start pulling her from the lab if she keeps making these dangerous mistakes, because in reality, anyone making them without a disability would be pulled as well. If she is shadowing you, and you are the one who is essentially in charge of her, then take charge of her and pull her when she makes these mistakes, and then record it and report it.", "This is the way.", "This is it exactly, and OP sounds very sympathetic to Jane. We all have things that we are good at and not so good at, hopefully, that eagerness can be redirected towards something that Jane is better suited to.", "My friend\u2019s teen daughter lost the ability to read from long Covid. More people need to know about this stuff.", "Omg my anxiety would be through the flipping roof if I was in your shoes. Definitely bring it up to management for the safety issues because this is what it's about in the end.", "That doesn't sound legal. Shadowing is exactly that - following around and observing. That assumes someone has received the required training already, and simply needs to see the coursework in action. Jane CLEARLY hasn't, and your job strapped you with her. If she has no chemistry background or coursework, then why is she there? Some chemicals can be so caustic down a regular pipe that it will degrade the piping and cause serious contamination or damage. I've been in a biology lab, and we had specialty sinks for SOME chemicals - not all - and the other regular tap sinks were NOT for chemicals - but they had specialty equipment to detect such dumps. If ANYONE poured anything except WATER down them, a alarm would go off near the offending sink. It's loud, and bright too.", "Oh, right, I just assumed OP delegated the responsibility to a coworker when taking breaks. If that doesn't happen then that would be an issue", "The way this is written makes it sound like OP isn't allowed to do that if she has to supervise her eating and going to the bathroom. It also sounds like if she doesn't watch her like a hawk, the woman is going to injure herself or others so I doubt it. Especially as OP said she's being held responsible for things the lady is screwing up."]}
