It's your JOB'S fault), nor were you given adequate training in preparation for this mentor position. I'm assuming you're also not being paid to mentor her... which is also unethical. \n\nI'd also like to say it grossly unfair to put a disabled person with someone that did not agree to mentor them.

I said OP isn't an asshole for not wanting to train her, but none of us are in the position to judge whether she's putting her head in a fume hood because OP hasn't been trained to teach people and especially has no experience with her disability has no idea how to communicate \"don't do that it's not safe\" in a way that will get through to her, or if she's actually incapable of learning how to be safe in this environment. We don't know enough to judge if any \"babysitting\" is necessary or if it's only turned out this way due to OP's failure at training her. (A failure which, yeah, it's OP's fault-- don't get me wrong!) Which makes talking about her like she's a five year old loose in a lab a bit problematic-- I don't think OP should train her, I'm just saying OP should re-evaluate how he views and talks about her more generally.", "Thank you, I'm sorry to hear about your family and friend's experiences with long Covid as well! It's truly a bewildering sensation.", "Thank you for your reply! Yeah, I wasn't given ANY form of training regarding having an individual from Jane's programme shadowing me. I was fine with the idea of someone just watching what I do on a daily basis and maybe lending a hand with the more mundane tasks, however I also have to do far more, including accompanying her to lunch to make sure she eats her food and can heat it up, I have to accompany her to the bathroom (I wait outside of course) to make sure she's okay.  \nI think you're correct in saying that I hold resentment for this situation, but it's not her fault. She doesn't frustrate me as a person, the fact that I am directly responsible for someone else's safety and wellbeing does, and the worst part is, sometimes she doesn't even know any better.   \n\n\nJane was trying to help someone dispose of some solutions. Some of our chemicals can just go down the drain after being diluted with water, some of them go in specific waste containers.
