All these kids are waiving at parents and generally doing what we all know kids expected to perform do, except my kiddo. She\u2019s stood there, FACE OF THUNDER scowling at the floor. This is really uncharacteristic for my kid, I expected her to be the loudest and waviest of the bunch, but she didn\u2019t move a muscle for the entire 10 mins or so of concert, just scowled at the floor.\n\nEven when she\u2019s being told off she doesn\u2019t have this reaction so, hopefully understandably I was concerned. \n\nThey sung three of their songs and had a little intermission (which as a parent, 3 songs at a nursery carol concert sounds just right!). \n\nThis is where I may have become TA, and have been feeling guilt filled on behalf of the other parents:\n\nI made my way to the side room where the kids and staff and staff had gone to get the drinks for the kids etc to check on my little one and ask her if she\u2019s ok, what\u2019s up etc. got no where really, apart from maybe she wanted to be dressed like a lion instead of a donkey (BEST DONKEY COSTUME IVE EVER SEEN BTW!).

Well done!", "My son's first Christmas show he was banned. He is super shy and quiet (even now at 19). They were practicing their songs and apparently out of no where he started telling them to sit down and shut up. Saying they're too noisy. He apparently kept doing it, so they told me he couldn't take part. \n\nThe next year he was a star. All the stars had on white tights, t shirt and some tinsel. He absolutely wouldn't wear tights. So I made him a costume (parents were to make them, most chose white tights for their kids), and I put so much time and effort in. Both he and I made it. Everyone said he looked great. He still didn't sing though. For some reason he could never remember songs, or nursery rhymes. He tried so hard to remember them but they just didn't stick. \n\nHe then had to dress up as a sprout one year \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 it was hilarious. He was fuming. His exact words were (they know I hate sprouts, this is payback for me not singing). He stepped on stage to do the dance with the rest of the Christmas dinner, and everyone laughed. It was comedy gold. \n\nTo this day he still hates attention. Would rather sit by himself and his dog. He can remember song lyrics if he is interested in it. He remembers history and facts after hearing it only once. But he still couldn't sing humpty Dumpty if you asked him. \n\nI asked him if he wanted me to get him tested for autism as all of my sister's boys are on the spectrum, and we think my brothers son is, but he said that he is happy as he is. I think he is perfect as he is. \n\nSo all in all you have many a Christmas show drama to come \ud83d\ude02 Let's hope a poo doesn't ruin her next show", "NTA? The parents had three full songs to get all the footage they needed of their kids singing in a production they will likely do again in a year. \n\nLet\u2019s put this in context a little bit\u2026.\n\nYou come across a video of \u201cscared little girl doesn\u2019t want to sing without her dad with her, dad joins in on the fun\u201d.

Not so much \n\nYTA for not having the wherewithal to either sit on the floor in front, stand off to the side, or gently tell your kid they don't have to be in the concert and taking them home.

You're little donkey needed you, and you showed up, that's something that she will remember forever. I wish a MFr would say something to me when I'm making sure my donkey is comfortable.\n\nClear resounding NTA, any parent worth their salt would do the same.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NTA. \n\nFirst of all, not all 3 year olds are developmentally at a place to perform in front of a group of strangers. Some adults aren\u2019t even able to do it!! See\n\nSecondly, there are so many issues 3 year olds can have that we aren\u2019t even aware of at that age. We didn\u2019t know our youngest had Selective Mutism until she was almost 4 and her prek teacher contacted us with concerns of her \u201csevere delays-\u201c all things that she could do at home. As we dug deeper it came out that she hadn\u2019t said a single word to anyone ALL YEAR!!! We just thought she was shy! Turns out she had a severe anxiety problem that no one, not even her doctor or therapists that has been working with her for 2 years, had picked up on. (Selective Mutism physicality freezes the vocal cords and makes them mute, it\u2019s not a choice.) \n\nBottom line- there\u2019s so much that can be going on with kids so young that even professionals, masters and doctorate level professionals, can\u2019t pick up on that our default should always be kindness and patience. We don\u2019t know what demons they\u2019re fighting and they can\u2019t tell us. \n\nKeep an eye on kiddo. She was fine after a good poop but that might be coincidence. There might be more going on that hasn\u2019t presented itself and this might be the first sign of an anxiety issue, among other things. Our daughter with SM is an absolute **clown** at home and you\u2019d never think she is so severely affected if you watched her from afar. She\u2019s the youngest of 6, too, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re novice parents. Some kids are just like that- they surprise you.", "I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong. The teacher said okay. In my kids\u2019 school, this was 10-13 years ago, it wasn\u2019t a big deal for parents to go on stage to help their kids out. Or stand in front of the stage and help their kids out. Or anything really. All the parents have good manners and don\u2019t try to overshadow the kids or do anything else weird. I think most teachers expect that the more clingy or insecure kids to need some help to get going. At my daughter\u2019s ballet recital the 3 year olds usually have their parents on the side of the stage or in front of the stage to help with stage frights too. Most kids are usually okay but one or two might not be. And we want all the kids to enjoy themselves and love what they\u2019re doing. If they need some help then that\u2019s completely understandable and okay. So I\u2019d say NAH. My kids love the spotlight so I\u2019ve never really had a problem and can just sit in my seat and take videos and pictures. But I\u2019ve never really gotten mad or think that the other parents are intruding or taking the spotlight away whenever they\u2019ve had to help their kids out.", "YTA. Yikes.", "NTA you were trying to make your child feel better. It's not like you were up there for the whole concert and the people who work at the nursery didn't tell you not to.", "YTA 100%", "NAH. LOL! Nobody has a sense of humour? It\u2019s a bunch of 4 year olds, not the Vienna Philharmonic. I\u2019d have been laughing myself silly at the proceedings.

Who are all the Y T A people?\n\nThe show is not for mums and dads it's for the kids.  Your daughter was uncomfortable so you did what would make it comfortable for her so that she could enjoy it.  That is your job (well, one of many!) as a dad.  She was not stroppy or having a tantrum, she was uncomfortable and some kids are uncomfortable being in the spotlight and singing on stage.  And she's 4.  Still only a baby.  There's time enough for her to learn to be on stage with other kids.  It's nursery school, not the West End!\n\nThe other parents got 3 songs without you while your daughter stood uncomfortable and not wanting to be there (saw your edit, she wanted to be sat on the loo!).  \n\nHonestly, if I was watching it my thoughts would be \"Awh look at that dad making an eejit out of himself so that his daughter is happy.  How sweet!\"  (And if you were a mate I'd have definitely got a video of it for bribery / embarrassing purposes!).", "YTA. This just reads as someone who has a child and suddenly makes their entire personality about the fact that they're a parent now. The world does not revolve around your child.", "NAH- it's really not that deep for OP to be up there for one song. That is assuming he wasn't belting the song louder than all the kids combined or something crazy. If he just got up there and sang to support his upset little girl in a Pre-K concert, then I don't see the harm. I wouldn't care if I was one of the parents of the other kids. If you care more about photo ops than your child's classmate's wellbeing/ feelings then you have some self reflecting to do. Are there other ways it could have been handled? Sure. Did this solution cause any real harm? No.", "YTA.\n\nI get it. I'm a parent and I would go into \"protect the tiny human\" mode too, but it's not just about your kid.

Everyone was supposed to dance, which they continued to do, and he stayed off to the side with his kid. It sounds like you were less helpful and more disruptive to the detriment of everyone there, likely for attention.", "[deleted]", "My oldest is also 4, and also has a holiday singing concerts exactly like this at preschool. Sometimes she\u2019s in a fantastic mood and other times (like the most recent one) she seems down or disoriented. If you were in my kid\u2019s video I\u2019d be annoyed, it should only be the cute children and maybe the teachers. So YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t always have to force your kid to be happy or do what she requests, you know that right? I know that most other kids were enjoying it, but if your child isn\u2019t feeling it unfortunately it\u2019s fine for them to sit it out.", "NTA\nYour small child was going to melt down if you tried to send her back up on stage alone.

He was just up there for the last song. Kids in the 3-4 age range get distracted by just about anything, so it's not surprising most of them stopped singing. If it was that big of a deal, the teacher could have restarted or redone the song after getting the groups attention again. The teacher could have even invited a family member of each student to quickly come up and sing the song with them so that all the kids and families could be on board. This was likely just a quick little thing, that wasn't expected to go perfectly to begin with because it's Pre-K kids. There's a lot that could have been changed about the scenario to have fixed the issue and make it run smoother, half of which don't fall in this guy's shoulders. It's just a little photo op and video moment, which I don't think is worth getting bent about if the majority of it went according to plan.

I\u2019m hoping that during the first half they managed to get plenty of photos! It was staff only taking pics with 2 of them dedicated to photos so we will find out if they got anything good probably next week \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "You are also an asshole then, to your entire community", "Just want to thank you for this. My son just had his Christmas song thing and just stood there the whole time. I just recorded and didn\u2019t say or do anything since I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the other parents recording their kids being cute and singing.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure how normal it was for kids to just stand there while everyone else was singing, so this made me feel better \ud83d\ude05", "Then he should have removed her from the concert. YTA to OP.", "So screw all the other parents who were there to see the center of their universes? That's rude at best", "Well my friend, that\u2019s what makes you the asshole in this situation. I have daughters and they\u2019re everything to me. But I also have consideration for others. Your kid was grumpy, she wasn\u2019t having a full meltdown. You could have let it go instead of inserting yourself in the play just for your daughter\u2019s comfort.", "Then take your kid off the stage and let the other parents enjoy watching their kids.", "Being overly protective of your child isn\u2019t an excuse to make bad choices.", "Protect her from what? She was not in danger. If she didn't want to go back out there to perform she could have come to sit with you in the audience. There were solutions that did not involve you being an inconsiderate asshole, and you did not choose those options. YTA", "Boooo booooo tomato tomato. YTA. This comes across as you trying to be wholesome and cute when it's not. You're entitled.", "That\u2019s not an excuse though. You are an adult, you need to use your impulse control. She was not in danger. She was fine. \n\nYTA", "[removed]", "Then take the kid with you, don\u2019t go onstage.

I wouldn't mind at all having one of the parents in my pictures. I don't know maybe in just not an entitled self centered parent and I realize shit happens, especially with 4 year olds", "OP didn\u2019t know she had to go to the bathroom at the time and thought she was mad about the costume.", "at the time the dad thought she was upset because she was a donkey.  The shit didn't happen until later.", "Exactly, it would be a hit online with the spotlight being on said daddy.", "Maybe! Thank you.", "Like I said, no sense of humour.\ud83d\ude02", "I mean they sung three songs before he got up, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s a big deal.

You over did it to be the center of attention competing with small kids, ruining the play for other parents, that is immature, selfish, and narcissistic behaviour on a whole other level, gross!", "Protect her from what exactly?", "You need to get this into your 100% dad head. You are not doing your kid any favours by letting them get whatever they want whenever they want. How many parties do you think she will be invited to after your 100% dad head insists she gets to blow out the candles? She's young. Let her learn.  She grumpy and you checked on her. Then you ruined an entire performance. You may think the staff didn't care. Trust me, they did. They were just better at keeping up appearances.", "Awww :)", "I'm just confused on why OP decided to go on stage instead of removing the kid from the stage (if refused let go of OP).

It was a nursery school, they had already sang three out of four songs, he sat with his daughter for song four.  \n\nAnd I very much doubt the parents had paid a fortune to see it.  It's kids singing a few Christmas songs, not Les Miserable.  \n\nDaughter is young, she's not even 4 yet.  She's still a baby.  And some kids don't feel comfortable in the limelight.

I agree. But not this dad.", "Yeah because none of the other kids were upset. He still didn\u2019t know the reason why she was acting that way, it could have been because another kid was mean to her or something.", "You do realize that nursery school performances are important to other people too, right? This has nothing to do with price or quality.", "The Les Miz line really made me laugh\ud83e\udd23", "You're 100% sure none of the other kids were exhibiting such clear signs of distress as having a slightly grumpy looking face?
