If he's at home, with the baby, you can't pick up odd jobs to bring money home?\n\nThis whole situation just seems like a couple of irresponsible kids who made a baby out of sheer stupidity, and neither has the wherewithal to do right by the child.", "Do you realize how dumb you are?", "How long have you been with your husband?", "I'm pro-choice but termination should not be a pre-sex birth control method.", "if OP is so worried about finances she can get a job, not waiting to find a project, get a job that has a stable income", "Depending where you live, paid time off exists", "Neither is letting a guy creampie you while you don't have a stable situation.", "Why is his mental and physical health more important in the long run? Than hers?", "this is always an amusing stance.", "The phrasing \u201cget on birth control\u201d is putting it only on OP though \n\nBoth the parties in the relationship have a responsibility here", "Absolutely that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying these people are both needing to be responsible", "I don\u2019t want either of these people having children right now, they both need to use birth control and take responsibility", "Nothing bothers me more when a woman gets pregnant because the guy, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like condoms\u201d. Yeah dude, no one \u201clikes\u201d condoms, but if you want to have sex with me, you will be using one. So what\u2019s it gonna be? Your hand, or a condom? NTA\n\nNever ever let a guy talk you into not using a condom for his own pleasure. It\u2019s so incredibly selfish. It\u2019s okay to say no. If he ends things as a result, you\u2019re better off, trust me.", "I saw a meme once that was like \"how is a bad a surprise. Maybe if your fkin without a condom and a pizza comes out that's a surprise \" was the punchline. But yeah never mind. Far as I'm concerned no accidents here. I honestly bet that if she was making enough to support them, albeit with a just barely margin, this man would not be working.  \n\nLike this is not to say he's using her. That's not the default opinion and idk their relationship and how good or bad it is but it genuinely feels like he either baby trapped her but loves the baby or he's one of those who thinks they can't be fired", "To be fair and play a bit of devil's advocate,  no one can predict a c section and she, being an artist, technically could work through her pregnancy otherwise. Maybe not so much in recovery and being s parent. Maybe having a nest egg saved up or else opting to not be bouncing between houses would be a solution though. .", "I am 100% never having kids. Dont much care for em. But I mean, I acknowledge that accidents happen. Condoms break, vasectomies aren't 100%.  Expenses and surprises happen. \n\nBut I do also have the same mindset when its someone who knows they're not ready. They dont have a permanent home and are couch surfing, they can't keep a job, they can barely feed themselves. Those are the ones im confused by. \n\nOP and hubs were both employed and married. If they were in a good place maybe a kid was the next best thing. Yea it hasn't turned out too well now but maybe circumstances were different prebaby.", "My passive income is six figures and I still don\u2019t think I have enough fuck you money to have kids. \n\nAnd honestly until I had fuck you money to be reckless with I won\u2019t be responsible for a child", "I mean. My godson was all set to come out like normal and the little fucker decided he didn't want to leave and went horizontal almost last second. No one could have predicted it because it had been smooth sailing the whole pregnancy.  She ended up with a c section.", "I'm not sure why you put blackouts in quotes, its actually very common for power to be cycled in some very large metropolitan cities. Op doesn't seem to be from the US, and I know from personal experience that it's unfortunately common in places like Manila or some of the bigger cities in India for rolling blackouts to occur as part of power management.", "Or at least birth control! Spermicide?? Anal sex!!? Omg", "Why is it her job to make him step up as a parent?", "Her little one is just 1 month old, obviously she has to care for him? Plus she had a c section, so needs recovery time too! Let's not have a dig at her for not being back working full time yet.", "Your statement doesn't make any sense. You cannot terminate a pregnancy before conception. \n\nDo you mean a plan? You don't get to claim you are pro-choice and then put restrictions or your particular form of morality on other people for the choices they make. Stay out of other people's reproductive choices. If you are pro-choice, then what other people choose do is not up to you.", "OP is 4 weeks out from a c-section. She has probably not been cleared to work at this time. Otherwise, I agree with you that OP, and her partner frankly, both need to be looking at more stable jobs with actual schedules and hours. Interpreter jobs can make very good money if you're actually putting in the time. Freelance art is a side gig, not a primary job-at least not until you build up your client base.", "And spend a big chunk of earnings on childcare.", "Sure, but the OP already said thats not their situation. He loses money for any time he misses.", "How does him taking the day off compromise her health?? If anything, it could give her time to rest while he watches the baby", "\"Don't worry, I'll pull out.\" One of the oldest lies ever told. Adam probably whispered that into Eve's ear.", "I asked my brother (a dedicated condom user before his marriage, at least) about this once, and he said, \u201cIt feels so good when I\u2019m using it, why would I care about how good it might feel when I\u2019m not using it?\u201d He was very strongly motivated not to accidentally father a child btw.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if it makes less of a difference in terms of sensation to some guys, or if some guys are just really childish and petulant, despite being old enough to have an active sex life.", "This happened to me too, but my daughter decided to be ass-first, and I also had a uterine septum that nobody knew about so she wouldn't have been able to turn anyway. I 100% wanted a natural, unmedicated birth and there was no indication that anything would prevent that until I was in the hospital 8 cm dilated with a midwife's hand all the way up in my business! A lot of c-sections are planned ahead of time for various reasons which bumps up the total number by a LOT.", "1/5 births across the globe are by c-section and its rapidly approaching 1/3. It should always be foreseen as a potential outcome when considering having a baby.", "They\u2019re doing them in Joburg right now, and Texas may have them this winter. It\u2019s just how things are in some places where the grid can\u2019t hack the demand.", "Uhh because that's her major issue with him and if she doesn't even attempt to communicate it then it won't change.", "First off, she wasn't working full time. She was working occassionally as a freelance artist, her words.\n\nSecondly, a one month old can be cared for by people other than the mom.\n\nThird, I know what a c-section entails and that it requires recovery. I didn't say full time work, what I said was that if the dad is at home all day, in the grandparents homes, there is likely enough support that a one month old (who is going to be sleeping the majority of the day at this point) can be managed well enough that something else can be done.\n\nThe fact is she flatly admitted that they got pregnant out of willful stupidity because \"but we didn't like using protection\" and then came here to whine that the same personality which led to this situation isn't miraculously different.\n\nIf you're immature and self-serving to the degree that you won't use protection during sex because \"I don't like it\", you're also immature and self-serving enough to keep blowing off work while mooching off a support system.", "Being pro choice doesn't mean you're not allowed to think what you want about how individual people handle their pregnancies. It means you don't think the government should be the one to make that decision. Nice virtue signaling though", "OR- hear me out- she could *also* get a wfh job. Even something part time would be more of a stable income than \u201cfreelance artist looking for projects\u201d", "Even with pullout there is precum with viable sperm or accidents.\n\nPullout method has a failure rate of something like 12% and generally you end up with a pregnancy within a year.", "Speaking as a gay man, I've never had unpleasurable sex *because of a condom*. I will certainly say that sans protection DOES feel better, but protected sex is not unbearable, and the risks of unprotected sex far outweigh the heightened pleasure imo.", "I think that's the one instance where the phrase \"poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine\" doesn't apply. That's kind of funny.\n\nBut dang. Birth facts were admittedly not something we looked up during her pregnancy the. But yeah I'd be prepping myself if I was so unfortunate and planning contingencies.", "Are those medical emergency c-sections? Because a HUGE number of total c-sections are because of doctor convenience, outdated medical practice &/or inaccurate medical advice."]}
