His family's Christmas including most of his extended family and I love and get along with most of them. He does have a cousin that I don't get along with. She was very hostile to me the first time we met and things never got better from there. She's the girl cousin that hangs out with only the guys because \"the girls in her family are just too much drama\". She doesn't have a good relationship with most of her female in laws. We'll call her Bianca.\n\nBianca recently got engaged and brought her fiance to the party. For some fucking reason they thought it would be appropriate for him to guess everyone's weight. Bianca says he's great at it and everyone always loves his party trick. I doubt it, but ok. Bianca insists he starts with me.\n\nAn important thing to mention is that I'm Polynesian, our body composition isn't the same. When I was in high school I was always 15-20lbs heavier than my female classmates even though I didn't look heavier.\n\nHe guessed that I was 165lb, I said no. he guessed 160, I said no. He guessed 155, I said no. He called me a liar, I told him I'm 180lb. He doubled down on calling me a liar, I confirmed that I am indeed 180lb. My in laws were surprised and saying I looked very good for my weight. So of course Bianca started being fake nice and said things like \"it's OK, not everyone can shed that baby weight like me. Dont feel bad\" and things like that. I told her I didn't feel bad, your fiance thought I weighed way less than I do, so I feel great. She started saying how she always has time to treat her body right and most moms are just lazing and make excuses about not having enough time. I was getting fed up and said well Bianca we just prioritize things differently, you prioritize your looks and I prioritize my work and having full custody of my kids. Bianca lost custody of her kids 2 months ago because she flew out of the country to chase her fiance and left her kids with a friend for 3 weeks. Bianca and her mother yelled at me for being classless and demanded I leave. My husband and his mother said that I would not be leaving as it's her house and that's where we were staying for the visit. Bianca and her parents and siblings left and it was very awkward after that. They and a few others think I crossed a line with bringing up her children and said they won't attend the NYE party tonight if I'm still here. They said the holidays are about family being together and bringing up how she doesn't have her kids was heartless. I really like most of my in laws and think i should apologize but I'm only willing to do so if I was actually in the wrong. My husband thinks i shouldn't apologize but my SIL thinks i should.

I mean to a point that it can and does affect a person's (especially a mother's) psyche and self-esteem greatly.\n\nYou delivered a very low blow in response to her casual 'body shaming' crap. Compare it to counter-attacking a slap in the face by running her over with a truck. Ideally, one should just get up and walk away from comments like hers, but if you do decide to verbally joust, keep it at the same level and don't go for the low-hanging fruit.\n\nYour concern here isn't so much mending Bianca's bruised ego as salvaging how you look to the rest of the family who were put off by your comment. They probably agree, somewhat, with how you feel, but they know better not to say things out loud, and especially not to publically humiliate someone and cause that kind of drama on what is supposed to be a fun, holiday gathering.\n\nI have no doubt everyone thinks Bianca is a major twit, but now they see you as a very mean person, and you're probably quite the opposite. You were absolutely the asshole to make that remark, deserved or not, because it was, verbally speaking, going nuclear. To redeem yourself in the eyes of the ones whose opinions matter to you, make a public and sincere apology for the remark, and ask Bianca for her forgiveness. The apology is necessary to placate the egos of those offended. The request for her forgiveness is a challenge to Bianca's 'higher self,' and if she manages to rise to such a challenge, you'll have participated in helping her to raise her consciousness just that much higher than where it currently resides.", "NAH.
