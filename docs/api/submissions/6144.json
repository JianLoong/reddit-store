{"id": 6144, "submission_id": "1004c68", "title": "AITA for refusing to apologize for what I said at Xmas and ruining NYE?", "selftext": "My SO and children traveled to my SO's home state for Christmas and New Years. His family's Christmas including most of his extended family and I love and get along with most of them. He does have a cousin that I don't get along with. She was very hostile to me the first time we met and things never got better from there. She's the girl cousin that hangs out with only the guys because \"the girls in her family are just too much drama\". She doesn't have a good relationship with most of her female in laws. We'll call her Bianca.\n\nBianca recently got engaged and brought her fiance to the party. For some fucking reason they thought it would be appropriate for him to guess everyone's weight. Bianca says he's great at it and everyone always loves his party trick. I doubt it, but ok. Bianca insists he starts with me.\n\nAn important thing to mention is that I'm Polynesian, our body composition isn't the same. When I was in high school I was always 15-20lbs heavier than my female classmates even though I didn't look heavier.\n\nHe guessed that I was 165lb, I said no. he guessed 160, I said no. He guessed 155, I said no. He called me a liar, I told him I'm 180lb. He doubled down on calling me a liar, I confirmed that I am indeed 180lb. My in laws were surprised and saying I looked very good for my weight. So of course Bianca started being fake nice and said things like \"it's OK, not everyone can shed that baby weight like me. Dont feel bad\" and things like that. I told her I didn't feel bad, your fiance thought I weighed way less than I do, so I feel great. She started saying how she always has time to treat her body right and most moms are just lazing and make excuses about not having enough time. I was getting fed up and said well Bianca we just prioritize things differently, you prioritize your looks and I prioritize my work and having full custody of my kids. Bianca lost custody of her kids 2 months ago because she flew out of the country to chase her fiance and left her kids with a friend for 3 weeks. Bianca and her mother yelled at me for being classless and demanded I leave. My husband and his mother said that I would not be leaving as it's her house and that's where we were staying for the visit. Bianca and her parents and siblings left and it was very awkward after that. They and a few others think I crossed a line with bringing up her children and said they won't attend the NYE party tonight if I'm still here. They said the holidays are about family being together and bringing up how she doesn't have her kids was heartless. I really like most of my in laws and think i should apologize but I'm only willing to do so if I was actually in the wrong. My husband thinks i shouldn't apologize but my SIL thinks i should.

Bianca's Christmas present was learning the true meaning of drama.", "NTA I wanted to say ESH here but like the amount of provocation you received before going nuclear on their asses was way off base for me. Maybe you did cross a line but fuck almighty they went through the line first.", "NTA \n\nanyone that takes shots at someone\u2019s body size, looks and anything else unprovoked are not good people. her priorities are clearly not good", "NTA.\n\nYou truly went for the jugular.

Bianca was playing stupid games, and guess what she won?", "Bianca was the real AH. You went a bit nuclear but she deserved it.", "NTA. Bianca effed around, Bianca found out. Sounds like she can dish it out but can't take it.", "Lol at anybody who thinks taking potshots at your weight was perfectly fine but noting that she lost custody of her children is not.\n\nNTA and don't hang out with anybody who loses custody of their kids. They are bad news.", "Nta.\nBianca absolutely earnt that comment. Its not exactly new news that we dont talk about weight. Particularly as a \"fun game\" infront of others!\nIm from nz and yes, Polynesian is different. And it makes me so happy that he under guessed. Take that bianca. \nShes obviously an attention seeker. And insane. \nI wouldn't apologise either. SHE should apologise. \nAnd someone please teach her oblivious fianc\u00e9 that weight guessing is tactless and stupid.", "NTA,\n\nNot only did this cousin shed her baby weight, she shed her kids entirely!  \nShe's not \"hurt\" about the kids. She's pissed because you deflated her artificially inflated ego, which she uses to justify bullying people. It was appropriate social feedback. You probably should have refused to play the weight game, but I assume you were trying not to be the party pooper.\n\nYour husband and MIL backed you in the moment about not leaving, but do they want you to apologize? If they do, it puts you in a tough situation. In that case you could offer to apologize if she apologizes first for her insulting comments, unless it's a matter of principle.", "NTA. I am in favor of not starting fights, but definitely in favor of ending them. To use other commenter's analogy, she dropped bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb, without any other family members taking her to task, so you finally dropped a nuclear bomb. End of fight. You don't owe ANYBODY an apology. You would not have said what you did if she hadn't kept blabbing her insults. The family members who are telling you to turn the other cheek...what exactly do they mean by that?? How many times are you supposed to be verbally slapped by her? Why are they supporting her bad behavior? What the f is up about playing guess your weight games? That's nobody's business, and you were being a good sport to play and not just shut it down and walk away.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your in for a more peaceful and happy new years than you otherwise would have had", "NTA honestly why the heck do they care about her feelings? She lost custody of her kids!!", "[deleted]", "ESH - Bianca's fiance's game was stupid, tacky, and obvious bait for being insulting. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the actual intent of the \"game\". Never should've happened and they were assholes about it, specifically to you. HOWEVER,\n\n>and having full custody of my kids\n\nYeah, that's going from bad to worse.\n\nYou both owe each other apologies.", " \"Bianca\" is clearly a superficial twit, but losing custody of one's kids is not only painful, it's downright traumatizing. I mean to a point that it can and does affect a person's (especially a mother's) psyche and self-esteem greatly.\n\nYou delivered a very low blow in response to her casual 'body shaming' crap. Compare it to counter-attacking a slap in the face by running her over with a truck. Ideally, one should just get up and walk away from comments like hers, but if you do decide to verbally joust, keep it at the same level and don't go for the low-hanging fruit.\n\nYour concern here isn't so much mending Bianca's bruised ego as salvaging how you look to the rest of the family who were put off by your comment. They probably agree, somewhat, with how you feel, but they know better not to say things out loud, and especially not to publically humiliate someone and cause that kind of drama on what is supposed to be a fun, holiday gathering.\n\nI have no doubt everyone thinks Bianca is a major twit, but now they see you as a very mean person, and you're probably quite the opposite. You were absolutely the asshole to make that remark, deserved or not, because it was, verbally speaking, going nuclear. To redeem yourself in the eyes of the ones whose opinions matter to you, make a public and sincere apology for the remark, and ask Bianca for her forgiveness. The apology is necessary to placate the egos of those offended. The request for her forgiveness is a challenge to Bianca's 'higher self,' and if she manages to rise to such a challenge, you'll have participated in helping her to raise her consciousness just that much higher than where it currently resides.", "NAH.  You both already didn\u2019t get along and were forced to be in the same room for an extended period of time. This is how family reunions work. For everyone. My uncle threw a frying pan at someone one time. If things have dissolved beyond repair so be it, but you probably should do what you can to save the party. Bianca too.", "ESH.
