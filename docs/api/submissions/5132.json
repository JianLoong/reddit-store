It doesn't have any role in my love for him.  It's simply about having the best comfort level (temperature-wise) while I sleep.

If both parents agree, but I don\u2019t think one parent should be able to say no to something like this because it.\n\nLike, I even remember sleeping with my mom when I got a nightmare, I\u2019m going to guess but probably less than once a month even, and I never had an issue transitioning away from it.  \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t seem like something important enough to require a yes from both parents unless one is doing it too often or when the kid is too old., or against the kids consent.\n\nLike it just seems weird that a 3rd party can interrupt the consent of cuddling here.  I don\u2019t understand why for that reason, I understand why a person might object.", "God forbid, kids get to be comforted \ud83e\udd74", "Who said it was healthy? When did the idea of segregated rooms become such an unbreakable rule that has to be militantly observed whether a young child is scared or adjusting to a new home or whatever it might be. Kids do get genuinely scared sometimes - the reasons might not be 'real' but their fear is. Instead of knowing they can rely on their parents for comfort and safety, they get turned away to 'deal with it' because we think a child who has been on earth for all of 60 months can't have times when they need a bit extra from mum or dad. \n\nMy door has always been open...yet my kid sleeps independently 95% of the time. Knowing she can sleep with us when she needs to has the opposite effect - it increases their security.", "You have no idea what you're talking about. Like it's embarrassingly painful so just stop. If you want to have an informed conversation then go educate yourself on children's development.", "You didn\u2019t give any reasons that being comforted by a parent when scared would make the child spoiled.

There are so many different things one can do (which I've already gone over) besides sleeping with the child.", "Yeah. I mean, my kids slept in my bed when they were sick. And those were exceptions. Again, it\u2019s a matter of personal opinions. I believe parents should be able to help their kids self soothe and gain the confidence to sleep by themselves. While giving them all the love and emotional support they need. But since this is a one time thing I can understand why people are against my POV.", "I didn\u2019t say kid doesn\u2019t get comforted.

Without that tactic applying.", "Well that just makes me really sad then that you think that way. I thought you were just some dumb teenager who was so narcissistic they didn't understand The sacrifices that parents need to be made. Instead you're somebody who was putting a grown ass man above your small childs emotions. Sad.", "That's to do with the post content not the comments.", "There was never any debate lmao (and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s just for the OP to not debate their judgement \ud83d\ude02) .

This is where we disagree. If you have a loving marriage, your husband is not a toxic dude who implements a rigid rule that nobody can break.

If your children have trouble sleeping, you comfort them, stay with them till they fall asleep, and let them know that you\u2019re there for them. But the room boundary should still be there.
