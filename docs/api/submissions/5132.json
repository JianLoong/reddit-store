Anyone who does not or their children first..... shouldn't have had them. \n\nBottom line\n\nToodles", "ESH.  If she would have stepped out, talked to the husband and said she thinks she should sleep with the kid, listened to the logic and then gone back and said I will sleep in your bed tonight, it would be NTA.", "Well at least you are consistent.  \n\nHonestly I would probably have responded the same way before my kids became teens incapable of independence.  And before I learned that accommodating fears makes them grow.  Reassuring obsessions makes them stronger.  \n\nSo ok I understand where you are coming from, I really do.  But I don't agree that it is ok to override a dad without a conversation.  Just not a good play.", "Don't you think that's a ridiculous accommodation for a ridiculous fear.", "Still sleeping together doesn't create any unhealthy relationship. Me and my sister are adults and she's married when we come home, once in a while we still sleep with our parents and we have another room. We'll be talking, watching a movie in bed, playing a game and then doze off in that bed and then we go back to our normal routine.\n\nThere isn't a concept of kids(not teens) having a bedroom here in my country for majority of people.", "Your kids aren't here :)", "While the kid is crying to spare your adult husbands feelings? No thanks", "Override, and then conversation. You say \u201csorry but I\u2019m going to sleep with daughter\u201d and then have the conversation in the morning, not while daughter is distressed or uncomfortable. It would be the same if op was the father comforting his baby, I\u2019d say the same thing. You put your kids first", "I think 5 year olds are not often rational, and if Dad has time to walk the kid to school, that sounds fine."]}
