Definitely not off to a great start.", "I think saying that a baby is \"my baby\"", "NTA this is a big moment in your life and while, yes, this is a small issue you're right that it probably has bigger implications for the future.

It is her grandbaby and you should say that every time she calls it \"her baby\"", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't an asshole for wanting this, but I think you need to brush up on your understanding of boundaries. The best explanation I ever heard was this: You can't control other people, so a boundary is about what you will do. It should be in a form like this: \"If you do **this thing-I-hate**, then I will do **that consequence**.\" \n\nYou can obviously set any boundary you want, but you have to be willing to do \"that consequence\" or else it really isn't a boundary. And if you set boundaries where the consequence seems way out of proportion to the infraction, then people will likely think you are overly sensitive. In this case, the thing you don't like just feels minor and weird. I mean, \"my baby\" is a very ordinary thing for people to say about children near them. Is there a consequence you are actually willing to impose? \"If you say 'my baby' again, I will never let you into my house again.\"\n\nGiven how strongly you are reacting to this, I have a hunch that your mother violates other, much more serious boundaries, and that you've never figured out how to actually set consequences that make sense. My advice would to be think hard about those other things that actually matter instead of dying on this hill.", "That could be, but OP said her sister had the first grandbaby 7 years ago.

That\u2019s very different than if history of respect and just a minor difference in short hand\n\nBoundaries are important but there\u2019s a drop off point where if you\u2019re too strict people decide you\u2019re not worth being around or helping.  Only you can decide what\u2019s worth the cost.

You kinda need to get over yourself lol.", "NTA.\n\nI had a feeling there was a reason this bothers you. I bet it came up at the end; your mother not respecting your boundaries.\n\nYou're highly aware of usage of words like this - because you know it usually says something about a person's way of thinking of something. You're afraid your mother will overstep boundaries and treat your baby as if it is hers, or you simply don't want your mother too close to neither your baby nor yourself to feel safe. Both are understandable. \n\nIt also IS your child. I am an aunt and always try to be respectful that certain things are parent-child things and I wouldn't like it if anyone did it to mine. Different people have different boundaries, and the use of this frase triggers you for understandable reasons. So everyone should respect it. \n\nYou can continue to correct her, but it doesn't sound as if she'll listen, and it in itself is not enough to refuse her to see your child (unless you feel unsafe/had enough of her in general). You can however state clear boundaries in general, such as stating beforehand that you're going to take at least for example 2 weeks to just be alone with your baby, and consider after that if you need more time before accepting visitors. That you won't let anyone kiss her for sanitary reasons. Etc. And then kick people out if they don't respect those wishes.", "I dealt with this too\u2026 and I hate to say when your baby is born, it\u2019s going to get worse. I (along with my siblings) had to put my foot down and piss my mom off by telling her multiple times that it\u2019s my baby and not hers and I will be raising her different than what she thinks is correct. I wish I did that before she was born instead of waiting because the intense exhaustion maybe made me come off bitchier than I normally would have", "I have to go with NAH. It seems like the biggest problem with it is that she isn\u2019t respecting a boundary, which is what\u2019s getting under your skin. Do I think you\u2019re making a mountain out of a mole hill? Erm yes. I call all the children I work with (childcare center) my babies\ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t think they\u2019re ACTUALLY my babies; it is used as a term of endearment.

I like to offer a totally different perspective from the ones you\u2019re getting. I\u2019m an Aunt.  I\u2019ll never have children of my own. I also say my baby. Not in anyway am I pushing out the parents. But rather, I\u2019m claiming this child in love. This is one of my MY precious nieces and nephews. This baby, I\u2019m not the mother of this baby but I am AUNT. I want to know if my baby niece or nephew has been sleeping good or if they\u2019ve pooped.

The more people loving you child the better", "I\u2019m actually going to say, YTA. I get why you feel that way. But I do think youre being dramatic. It\u2019s not a big deal.

And I do think it's a massive red flag.\n\nMothers (grandmothers) with no boundaries use small things like this to claim parental authority over grandchildren and set the stage for a lifetime of undermining your parenting and boundaries around your family.\n\nI suggest setting boundaries like \"if you refer to *my* baby as *your* baby I will not answer the question.  If you tell other people during events that it is *your* baby I will stop inviting you to events (such as baby showers).  Please demonstrate that you understand and respect that *I* and *only I* am the baby's mother, and *only I* (and co-parent) have parental rights and privileges.\"", "NTA  It is a big deal and you need to put a stop to this. She will make your life a living hell if you don't. NO means no and make sure there are consequences for breaking boundaries!", "My feedback is of course based entirely on my own experiences and admittedly not the most objective point of view: although having a mother who loves your child is priceless, grandparents can sometimes cross boundaries with grandkids, regardless of whether they are helping you raise the child or not. Keep an eye on that because once it takes hold it\u2019s like a runaway train.", "NTA\nThis is a red flag. Hard stop it now.\n\nKeep Mom out of the delivery room and do not leave her alone with **your** baby.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your problem isn\u2019t about the baby at all - it\u2019s about boundaries.", "It's your first baby so it's a very special moment for you. But you will rely on your mum so much when you're raising your child.    I'm sure your mum knows it's not her baby, and she's probably just so happy for you and super excited.. would you prefer her to say 'your baby your problem' in the future?", "YTA. Its not uncommon for Grandparents to do that and you are making a big deal out of nothing", "NTA.\n\nIt's not uncommon for grandparents to use 'my baby' for their grandchildren as a sign of affection. But: how you feel is how you feel. Sounds like this is the latest in a line of ongoing boundary issues with your mother, though.", "NTA\n\nOk imo you need to set this boundary hard NOW. Because once your baby is here she needs to REALLY respect your boundaries and preferences for parenting, feeding, etc. I have a short fuse with this stuff because my mom was the same, and my MIL. \n\nI would say \"I've told you before that it makes me uncomfortable. If you call MY BABY yours one more time, you will only be seeing your grandbaby on holidays (or whatever boundary you want to set) and then FOLLOW THROUGH. Maybe it can be pregnancy related, you could say \"or we won't be visiting you for the rest of this trimester because I don't need this right now.\"\n\nFor example, my baby was fussy with his gums and didn't like soothers. He did like to chew on my fingers though for comfort. My MIL was always nagging saying endless advice like \"don't give your baby soothers\" (find I'm not gonna argue cause he doesn't even like them) and \"just let your baby cry\" (um no, I'm going to respond to his cries thank you). \n\nAnyway, on our first visit to their house he was a little scared and upset at a new place with new people (they are very LOUD people and their house smells weird, like musty and old). But he was happy to sit on my lap and chew on my hand and that settled him easily. \n\nMIL physically rips my hand out of his mouth saying \"don't let him do that\" (because she's against comforting babies I guess?). I explain it's helping him calm down. She does it again the next time I turn my head (as if I wouldn't notice lol?). I told her to STOP and said \"if you do that again, you will not get to see your grandbaby again!\" Which stopped her in her tracks thankfully.\n\nBut you seriously have to go mama bear on these people, because they won't respect you otherwise, and YOUR baby needs you to protect them and care for them!", "You're NTA and you're not wrong. Your mother is a boundary trampler, so you need to maintain your barriers, and perhaps, keep her at arm's length and not let her be alone with your baby or keep the baby overnight or drive her anywhere without you.\n\nBe prepared to cut off visits if your mom won't cooperate with your parenting rules and schedules.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t even have a child and when I hear people do that it pisses me off. Don\u2019t call other peoples children your children. Like, why do you need to make it about you? \n\nI love the first persons response. Just give it back to her every time. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?!\u201d Lol", "Ok your title is asking something different. Honestly I\u2019d say you\u2019re a bit of an AH for the title alone but given this is actually about folks not respecting boundaries, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. \n\nBtw folks aren\u2019t trying to claim your baby or anything. It\u2019s mostly just a saying, a welcoming of the baby into the family I guess. It\u2019s odd but harmless.", "Okay, mom, let's get this fight out of the way now. \n\nGrowing up, I didn't feel like I could defend myself.

Let's keep it simple.\n\nIf you continue to ignore that I have asked you to  say 'my grandbaby', and that I have asked you to stop saying 'my baby' I will go nuclear mumma-bear right here and now - you will not get to meet *MY baby*. You will not spend time with us, and it will be as if you do not have *this grandbaby*. I will make sure she gets to see and know everyone else in the family *except* for you. \n\nI will do everything in my power to protect *my child*, and if that includes getting rid of you, then that is what I will do. Do you hear my words? Do you believe me?\n\nI would very much like for *my baby* to have a relationship with her *grandmother*, but that is up to you and how you carry on.\n\nAlright, would you like a cup of tea?\n\n\nFrom someone who moved interstate to remove myself and my child from an ongoing argument - it is easier to train the boundary-stompers *before* the child is born.
