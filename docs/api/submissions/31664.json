Congrats!!\ud83d\udc4f \n\nI would just play completely ignorant until she uses the right term. And then just ask why she called it \"her baby\" when that wasn't what she meant. Rinse and repeat.", "NTA if for no other reason than the fact that you've told her repeatedly that this bothers you and, instead of respecting that, she gets upset and keeps doing it.\n\nSince she has a history of not respecting your feelings, this will probably just get worse once your baby is born. Definitely not off to a great start.", "I think saying that a baby is \"my baby\"", "NTA this is a big moment in your life and while, yes, this is a small issue you're right that it probably has bigger implications for the future. Probably not a big enough deal to cause a huge scene at a family gathering over, but you should definitely communicate in a harder fashion that it won't be tolerated.", "Nope.  It is her grandbaby and you should say that every time she calls it \"her baby\"", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't an asshole for wanting this, but I think you need to brush up on your understanding of boundaries. The best explanation I ever heard was this: You can't control other people, so a boundary is about what you will do. It should be in a form like this: \"If you do **this thing-I-hate**, then I will do **that consequence**.\" \n\nYou can obviously set any boundary you want, but you have to be willing to do \"that consequence\" or else it really isn't a boundary. And if you set boundaries where the consequence seems way out of proportion to the infraction, then people will likely think you are overly sensitive. In this case, the thing you don't like just feels minor and weird. I mean, \"my baby\" is a very ordinary thing for people to say about children near them. Is there a consequence you are actually willing to impose? \"If you say 'my baby' again, I will never let you into my house again.\"\n\nGiven how strongly you are reacting to this, I have a hunch that your mother violates other, much more serious boundaries, and that you've never figured out how to actually set consequences that make sense. My advice would to be think hard about those other things that actually matter instead of dying on this hill.", "That could be, but OP said her sister had the first grandbaby 7 years ago. I wonder how Grandma refers to that kid...", "NAH. Good God. She\u2019s excited for OP. It\u2019s not a hill to die on. Reddit will have OP go NC soon \ud83d\ude44", "Ouf that is a dangerous game. It can either be effective or do damages. I mean, I would do the same because it would come naturally to me. But if OP is not like that, I wonder how it will come out.\n\nIf not done properly, it will just sound rude. And I know we can argue that OP's mom is being rude herself but it doesn't mean rudeness is the only way.", "I mean she clearly hasn\u2019t taken OP seriously when asked nicely not to say it so maybe OP needs to be rude."]}
