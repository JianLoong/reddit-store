My mum and her dad got married when I was 11 after my dad died three years prior. I had a hard time accepting her dad and her but in the end I got used to it and we have a solid relationship,at lest her dad and me. \n\nPaula got her first car when she was 17 just after she got her license it was an older Audi she got from her dad it wasn\u2019t the nicest car but a good start. She didn\u2019t liked the car but it was better than nothing so she used it, but after 4 months she crashed it into my mum\u2019s car as she was coming back from a party. The second car she had she got last year for Christmas my mum and her dad bought it for her but guess what she drove it into the river on New year because she forgot to put the handbrake on. \nMy mum and her dad were furious but she didn\u2019t care she said she would just buy a new car and they should chill out. She moved out afterwards to her own apartment.\n\nSo I just bought myself my dream car a Mini Cooper 2014 I did years of saving for it. My stepsister visited two weeks ago over the weekend while I was at my grandparents house, so she thought she could use my car while I was gone and drove shopping with it. As I got home I saw a huge scratch at the back. I asked my mum how it got there she was clueless she didn\u2019t know Paula took the car while they were sleeping, Paula looking all innocent said she took the car on a little Shoppingtour because I wasn\u2019t using it. I was so angry at her and said if she ever uses my car again without my ok I would kick her arse to the moon and back. She said she was sorry and that some idiot was it not her.\n\nWhen I was coming home today I saw my car crashed into the wall in front our house and Paula my mom and her dad standing besides it. I was furious I asked what happened and my my car was in the wall. Paula said she accidentally crashed it because she wanted to drive to the nail salon and she confused the front and reverse gears. I exploded I screamed at her that I want her to pay for the car and that she was a horrible person because she didn\u2019t even looked guilty for destroying my car and she should never drive a car agin in her life because all she does is cause accidents, I stormed away and looked myself into my room. \n\nHer dad said I should forgive her and that it was an accident but we were sisters. I was shocked and so disappointed in my mum because she said nothing against it.\n I said that she wasn\u2019t my sister and I would never forgive her and that I would move to my grandparents and that she should better pay for my car or I would sue her. He said that I was a brat talking to them like that and that not forgiving her would make me a bad human being. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not forgiving her?", "created_utc": 1675881398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x6z4c/aita_fir_not_forgiving_my_stepsister_for_crashing/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are protecting others, frankly, by reporting her.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely need to file a police report, file a claim with your insurance as well. They will go after her easier than you suing her.", "Just what I was going to say.", "Absolutely this!! Unreal she had the audacity to total both of her cars, scratch yours without remorse then took your car again and wrecked it, again, without remorse. How are your mom and step dad not furious with her? Absolutely sue her for the damages if she doesn't intend to fix it, especially considering YOU saved for the car and bought it on your own, meanwhile she was GIVEN two cars and wrecked them both. \nIf she was apologetic or offered to fix it that would be one thing but you very clearly told her she wasn't allowed to use your car again after she stole it the first time. I'm blown away by your parents reaction as well.\nETA obviously NTA", "NTA. But, OP, call the police. If you don't, you might not be able to come after her later for the money for your car. Call the police. Tell them the car was stolen and crashed. Your insurance should pay to replace it, and your sister can deal with the consequences of her actions.\n\nAnd move out. Your family doesn't sound great.", "But... OP is somewhat naive to allow the keys out of possession, especially after the first incident. This doesn't mean it's OPs fault, but she just learned a tough lesson in this regard.", "Also, why on earth would she forgive when it sounds like Paula hasn't even faked an apology?", "It's already telling that OP bought her own car, while stepsister already got 2.", "> She's going to ~~get someone killed~~ kill someone.", "Honestly, it is very possible that they just didn't have the spare resources to offer after using them all on the stepsister.\n\nIt is an interesting thing...on one hand, you should never EXPECT your parents to help you with things like cars (unless they promise to, that is). To expect a car is entitled. On the other, it isn't a great feeling when you watch a sibling get so much more financial support from your parents for no other reason than \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\" when you yourself would feel bad asking for even a fraction of it yourself.\n\nIt has happened to me. The only thing I had ever asked my father for on that front was to consider co-signing for a loan so that I could start on my credit and get an affordable rate on a safe car. I would never outright ASK our father for a car.\n\nSometimes he talked about getting me a car while I was learning but...every time he said a word about cars for me (be it myself or helping me to get a loan) my brother did something incredibly stupid that put him out of a car, and it meant our father would scramble to find him a new one. he has already done this 4 times... our father has helped him with 4 cars, 3 of them purchased and 1 of them co-signing.\n\nMy brother has fought him tooth and nail over car payments every month for the year and a half he has owned it, and will lie about it to make the car payments months late, tanking our father's credit score. Now it has dropped over 150 points. Now our father couldn't even help me cosign on a car now if he tried; our brother is knowingly destroying our father's credit.\n\nThe cherry on top of the sundae? The latest car broke down last week; he had been having issues for over a year and never bothered to address it, so the 100 dollar fix turned into 1600. He went to ask our father to help him get car number 5, but our father can't even get a loan for a new vehicle because of the credit.\n\nI make sure not to complain to him; it isn't his responsibility to help me, and I don't want him ever thinking that. But it really burns me up watching my brother milk him for every cent our father has and knowingly sabotaging him in the process. He takes everything our father has and then tell everyone right in front of us that he has done everything himself and hasn't had anybody to ever help him...its the principle of the matter.", "Yeah based on ops mom and her step dad's reaction. We know who the favorite is. Especially if op had to save to get her car, but her step sister gets two paid for.", "Agreed! I personally leave my keys if I'm out of town and park at the home of a friend/family member...then again, I know MY people would only use the keys if they needed to move my car out of the way- like they needed the driveway for a car repair or something. In this case though, I would NOT have done that since step-sis clearly cannot be trusted...just so sad that some people don't expect consequences for their own really BAD decisions.", "I can't imagine how much this sucks for you, OP. But you're definitely NTA and I hope the police report goes smoothly--if she's got family in the force be prepared for pushback. Is there someone you can take with you for support?", "Please give us an update once you have a resolution.", "Please keep us updated. When you do get another car, you're going to have to take the keys with you at all times.", "Keep us updated!!!!!", "I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re filing a report with the police. So there\u2019s a record for your insurance company at the very least. Please update us after you speak with them!", "Good for you. This is absolute BS.", "Paula isn't just a nuisance, she's dangerous. She needs to have her license taken away, at least until she actually knows what she's doing.", "I hope your uncle won't be able to get her out of trouble with this.", "So... File a police report in the next town over.", "Tell your parents your will be filing a report for theft if you\u2019re not pay back within 24 hours."]}
