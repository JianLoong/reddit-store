My mum and her dad got married when I was 11 after my dad died three years prior. I had a hard time accepting her dad and her but in the end I got used to it and we have a solid relationship,at lest her dad and me. \n\nPaula got her first car when she was 17 just after she got her license it was an older Audi she got from her dad it wasn\u2019t the nicest car but a good start. She didn\u2019t liked the car but it was better than nothing so she used it, but after 4 months she crashed it into my mum\u2019s car as she was coming back from a party. The second car she had she got last year for Christmas my mum and her dad bought it for her but guess what she drove it into the river on New year because she forgot to put the handbrake on. \nMy mum and her dad were furious but she didn\u2019t care she said she would just buy a new car and they should chill out. She moved out afterwards to her own apartment.\n\nSo I just bought myself my dream car a Mini Cooper 2014 I did years of saving for it. My stepsister visited two weeks ago over the weekend while I was at my grandparents house, so she thought she could use my car while I was gone and drove shopping with it. As I got home I saw a huge scratch at the back. I asked my mum how it got there she was clueless she didn\u2019t know Paula took the car while they were sleeping, Paula looking all innocent said she took the car on a little Shoppingtour because I wasn\u2019t using it. I was so angry at her and said if she ever uses my car again without my ok I would kick her arse to the moon and back. She said she was sorry and that some idiot was it not her.\n\nWhen I was coming home today I saw my car crashed into the wall in front our house and Paula my mom and her dad standing besides it. I was furious I asked what happened and my my car was in the wall. Paula said she accidentally crashed it because she wanted to drive to the nail salon and she confused the front and reverse gears. I exploded I screamed at her that I want her to pay for the car and that she was a horrible person because she didn\u2019t even looked guilty for destroying my car and she should never drive a car agin in her life because all she does is cause accidents, I stormed away and looked myself into my room. \n\nHer dad said I should forgive her and that it was an accident but we were sisters. I was shocked and so disappointed in my mum because she said nothing against it.\n I said that she wasn\u2019t my sister and I would never forgive her and that I would move to my grandparents and that she should better pay for my car or I would sue her. He said that I was a brat talking to them like that and that not forgiving her would make me a bad human being. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not forgiving her?", "created_utc": 1675881398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x6z4c/aita_fir_not_forgiving_my_stepsister_for_crashing/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has a known history of being irresponsible without cars and took your car without your permission and against your wishes on more than one occasion, damaging it both times.

You need to report her for stealing your car!", "NTA\n\n\n>Her dad said I should forgive her and that it was an accident but we were sisters \n\nNo, you should *not* forgive her.   She has never NOT crashed a car she has used.  \n\nYour step-dad is an ass and passed that on to his entitled and spoiled daughter.   She's been gifted cars and stolen you car and crashed them all.   She is a menace to the public.  And she owes you the replacement price for the car.

Don\u2019t worry about how that affects your stepsister as if it is not done this way it will affect your insurance rates and driving record for many, many years. \n\nOP you are NTA, stepsister is and has no empathy at all.

Get a support system together so your family doesn't railroad you into forgiving her. Find somewhere else to live or they will hound you. Don't let them guilt trip you. Find a lawyer as well.
