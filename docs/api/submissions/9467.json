My mum and her dad got married when I was 11 after my dad died three years prior. I had a hard time accepting her dad and her but in the end I got used to it and we have a solid relationship,at lest her dad and me. \n\nPaula got her first car when she was 17 just after she got her license it was an older Audi she got from her dad it wasn\u2019t the nicest car but a good start. She didn\u2019t liked the car but it was better than nothing so she used it, but after 4 months she crashed it into my mum\u2019s car as she was coming back from a party. The second car she had she got last year for Christmas my mum and her dad bought it for her but guess what she drove it into the river on New year because she forgot to put the handbrake on. \nMy mum and her dad were furious but she didn\u2019t care she said she would just buy a new car and they should chill out. She moved out afterwards to her own apartment.\n\nSo I just bought myself my dream car a Mini Cooper 2014 I did years of saving for it. My stepsister visited two weeks ago over the weekend while I was at my grandparents house, so she thought she could use my car while I was gone and drove shopping with it. As I got home I saw a huge scratch at the back. I asked my mum how it got there she was clueless she didn\u2019t know Paula took the car while they were sleeping, Paula looking all innocent said she took the car on a little Shoppingtour because I wasn\u2019t using it. I was so angry at her and said if she ever uses my car again without my ok I would kick her arse to the moon and back. She said she was sorry and that some idiot was it not her.\n\nWhen I was coming home today I saw my car crashed into the wall in front our house and Paula my mom and her dad standing besides it. I was furious I asked what happened and my my car was in the wall. Paula said she accidentally crashed it because she wanted to drive to the nail salon and she confused the front and reverse gears. I exploded I screamed at her that I want her to pay for the car and that she was a horrible person because she didn\u2019t even looked guilty for destroying my car and she should never drive a car agin in her life because all she does is cause accidents, I stormed away and looked myself into my room. \n\nHer dad said I should forgive her and that it was an accident but we were sisters. I was shocked and so disappointed in my mum because she said nothing against it.\n I said that she wasn\u2019t my sister and I would never forgive her and that I would move to my grandparents and that she should better pay for my car or I would sue her. He said that I was a brat talking to them like that and that not forgiving her would make me a bad human being. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not forgiving her?", "created_utc": 1675881398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x6z4c/aita_fir_not_forgiving_my_stepsister_for_crashing/", "score": 1586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To expect a car is entitled. On the other, it isn't a great feeling when you watch a sibling get so much more financial support from your parents for no other reason than \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\" when you yourself would feel bad asking for even a fraction of it yourself.\n\nIt has happened to me. The only thing I had ever asked my father for on that front was to consider co-signing for a loan so that I could start on my credit and get an affordable rate on a safe car. I would never outright ASK our father for a car.\n\nSometimes he talked about getting me a car while I was learning but...every time he said a word about cars for me (be it myself or helping me to get a loan) my brother did something incredibly stupid that put him out of a car, and it meant our father would scramble to find him a new one. he has already done this 4 times... our father has helped him with 4 cars, 3 of them purchased and 1 of them co-signing.\n\nMy brother has fought him tooth and nail over car payments every month for the year and a half he has owned it, and will lie about it to make the car payments months late, tanking our father's credit score. Now it has dropped over 150 points. Now our father couldn't even help me cosign on a car now if he tried; our brother is knowingly destroying our father's credit.\n\nThe cherry on top of the sundae? The latest car broke down last week; he had been having issues for over a year and never bothered to address it, so the 100 dollar fix turned into 1600. He went to ask our father to help him get car number 5, but our father can't even get a loan for a new vehicle because of the credit.\n\nI make sure not to complain to him; it isn't his responsibility to help me, and I don't want him ever thinking that. But it really burns me up watching my brother milk him for every cent our father has and knowingly sabotaging him in the process. He takes everything our father has and then tell everyone right in front of us that he has done everything himself and hasn't had anybody to ever help him...its the principle of the matter.", "Yeah based on ops mom and her step dad's reaction.

I dont want to be harsh but you may want to prepare yourself for that outcome if nothing makws her see the error of her ways. It hurts to think about, but will help you get through it if it happens later. Best of luck, and REPORT HER. You will NOT get any of that money back for that car or toward a new one if you dont.

Even roommates (who will have mutual respect for you at least 80% of the time) would be better to put up with than belittling and controlling family. And you talk before hand to be sure youll get along. You sign paperwork that you get to read yourself that protects you from a lot of things.
