It's your sister's special day, and she shouldn't have to deal with that negativity.", "After reading your update I think you might want to consider involving authorities and getting a restraining order since he knows where you live. Your sister, by the way, should consider it as well.", "You didn't kick him out. He was never invited.", "You kept a fucking racist away from an interracial wedding and wonder if you're asshole? Are you OK?", "I am so sorry he's putting you through all this.  You are NTA.  Whatever else he may be, he is clearly very selfish, and very damaged.  He doesn't get to inflict that on any of you, any more than he already has.  Being present in someone's life is a privilege, not a right.", "nta. this man missed two of his childrens weddings because of his own damn actions.", "NTA in any way. I\u2019m sorry that your dad sucks, but it\u2019s great that you and your sister have each other\u2019s backs.", "NTA.  You might want to take a long look at those siding with your dad.  I\u2019ll bet if you peek under sheets, they are racist too.", "NTA - uninvited guests aren't allowed at the wedding, plain and simple. He's the reason he missed the wedding.\n\n\nIf you own your house (and are in America), property records are publicly available online in virtually all of the US. It's just a matter of searching on the county's tax assessor/property records site for your name.\n\n\nDoes aunt even know what her brother did to land in jail (or did you mean prison) that would make you not want to be associated with the man after what he did?", "Definitely NTA, you should have just MCMAP'd his ass right out of there.\n\nEta--sounds like you put it to good use when he found your house, I'll bet someone in his family knows where you live and told him.", "NTA he seems unhinged better he was not at the wedding instead of ruining her day and insulting / assaulting folks at the wedding", "NTA. If he truly wanted to make amends and repair the relationship he would have respected her choice not to have him at the wedding.", "Nta. Dude is dangerous by your own admission. I think a lot of questions with family you have to stop and ask yourself what would you do if this was a stranger doing the same thing the relative is doing? Being related by blood does NOT excuse any kind of poor behavior. \n\nYou did what you had to to keep everyone safe", "NTA. Props to you for utilizing your \u201cmilitary tactics\u201d.", "NTA.  A great brother and Marine.  We thank you for your service to your family and country.  Oorah", "NTA\n\nYour sister and her (now) husband get to decide who comes to their wedding and who gets kept out.\n\nYour father wanting to show up does not trump her right to not want him there.", "NTA. Also let his parole officer know what he\u2019s doing and get a restraining order/file a police report. The police will do nothing but the parole officer might if this counts as a parole violation and if so he\u2019s right back to jail and out of your life for a few more years", "NTA. And why the *fuck* does a racist want to go to an interracial wedding that he isn\u2019t even invited to?", "NTA\n\nI wish you were my brother because my family forced me to have my dad walk me down the aisle. Now, I'm getting remarried and I've been non-contact for years. I don't know how I'll handle it if he shows up to this wedding.", "NTA, please be careful you too!", "Bet he was on some kind of probation.\n\nYou should have called the police after your first unpleasant encounter with him.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You did as your sister asked.  You are a good brother.\n\nYour father knew he wasn't welcome and showed up anyway.  He knew better and thought he could bully his way in to where he wasn't supposed to be.  He's the AH, but you are not.  Anybody who defended his behavior is the AH, but you are not.\n\nDon't feel guilty for being the person your sister and her new family needed you to be.", "NTA. Honestly, I don't want to be offensive here, but your father sounds like a bag of shit. Not because he was in prison, probably for what got him there, though I respect you can't tell us the reason, but definitely for barging in where he is not welcome like that (X2), and generally for being a racist. We can't choose our parents, but we can choose who to associate with. Cut those strings, OP, and don't feel bad about it. At all.", "NTA, but your aunt is. Anyone with an opinion on the guest list is out of line. I would tell thrm exactly that, without further explanation.", "Absolutely NTA.  I hope you know you did the right thing.", "Stop answering the phone when these people call. They do not need or deserve the chance to berate you. NTA.", "NTA. Your father's actions speak for themselves. Protecting your sister's special day is important.", "You guys probably both need to get a restraining order. He\u2019s showing up belligerently where he\u2019s explicitly Unwelcome. \n\nNTA.", "Notify police that he came to your house banging on door for 10 minutes, which is a physical threat.  This will justify military response if he returns.  That is why I live in America.", "NTA. You\u2019re both better off without him. Your families are better off. He has no right to scare your wife & daughter like that either. His sister & that side of the family need to stop making excuses for him, they\u2019re just enabling him, not helping him", "\u201cMilitary tactics \u201c gotta love it.", "NTA\n\nWell, after your update I think it's clear that your father has proved he cannot control himself.\n\nHe could have talked to you in a civil manner. He chose to be aggressive at the wedding, and now at your own home, both times uninvited.\n\nDo you still think you should have tried to convince your sister to go through an ordeal like this?", "NTA. Also I think you should act like he knows everything. Where you live, where you work, where your child goes to school. Where your sister lives , who her husband is, etc. There is someone on your side who is also very sympathetic to your dad or at least holds the father status above all else.", "NTA. I think that was clear but when he showed up at your house that should have left no doubt.  He sounds like he is full of drama. He absolutely would have made the wedding about him.", "NTA you did the right thing!!!", "**NTA**\n\nYou protected your sister and your Brother-in-Law from an unwanted, racist guest. \n\nThe next time he bangs on your door, just call the cops on his ass. He won't do it again, that's for sure.", "His reaction to you establishing boundaries is all you need to show you you've made the right choice. Someone who wasn't going to throw a fit during the party wouldn't have thrown a fit when asked to leave before the party. You dodged a bullet, trust your gut, and just tell family members that they don't have all the details and that it's not something you wish to discuss further. You really don't need to explain yourself to them or anyone.", ">it was disrespectful to kick him out.\n\nIt was more disrespectful for him to show up knowing he's not wanted. sounds like they're not ready for that conversation though", "No, I never said I had any discrimination against my sister\u2019s husband, let alone any race. And it\u2019s not my family, it\u2019s only my father. I can\u2019t be \u2018letting them make me racist too\u2019 just because I felt guilty for not letting him into the wedding to see his daughter be married off.", "Exactly! And being told to not come and he comes anyways, and then proceeds to start yelling and insulting at OP for 10 whole minutes before leaving\u2026I mean if he was willing to insult his own son for 10 minutes for not getting his way, just imagine what he would\u2019ve done if he realized it was a biracial wedding as a racist. He sounds like an aggressive person. Edit: Saw the OP\u2019s edit. He is not just aggressive, he is downright dangerous!", "Wooo! Castle fan in the wild \ud83d\ude01", "There was another post where someone\u2019s like, \u201cOP is faking it and they got you!\u201d And someone else was like, \u201cthis is Reddit, no one got \u2018got\u2019\u201d", "the story is a racist acting like an asshole on 2 separate occasions, one of the most believable things posted on any advice reddit today."]}
