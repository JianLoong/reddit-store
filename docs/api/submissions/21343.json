My father (M59) got out of jail a few weeks ago, and insisted on attending my sister\u2019s wedding last week.\n\nMy sister came to me a week before the wedding asking to keep dad out if he arrives because she\u2019s scared he\u2019ll do something to the guests and resort to the reason he got into jail (which I cannot state).\n\nMy sister is also marrying an African American, and our father is completely racist, and she would prefer he not insult guests or possibly worse when he sees that her husband and his family is black.\n\nI understood my sister\u2019s worries, and, personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with my father after what he did, either.\n\nNow, at the wedding, as expected, my father arrived(by the way, he knew he was not welcomed). I was standing at the entrance of the venue, greeting the guests when I saw him, and immediately stopped him. I told him my sister asked that he not come, and that he must respect her decision and leave right then and there. He got absolutely livid and started yelling at me saying I\u2019m the AH for siding with my sister.\n\nI can see why he thinks I\u2019m the AH, but I was worried, not only for my sister\u2019s, but my brother-in-law and his family\u2019s safety too. They deserved to feel safe, even if that meant at the cost of aggravating my father.\n\nHe eventually left after insulting me for a good ten minutes, and I haven't talked to him since.\n\nNow, other family members are calling my sister and I the assholes, saying it was completely disrespectful to kick our father out of the wedding. My aunt(F53, father\u2019s sister) said that my father had already missed my wedding, and it was unfair he had to miss his other child\u2019s wedding.\n\nI was calm about it and I told her that I was just helping my sister feel comfortable and have her perfect day. I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s been nice without my father, but I am starting to feel a bit guilty, as I feel that maybe my sister and I may of been little harsh on my father, but I also know he doesn\u2019t really deserve forgiveness. I\u2019m just torn between it.\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\n7/4: He just came to my house\u2026 How he got my address? No clue. None of his side of the family knows where I live, but, whatever. He\u2019s been banging on the door for like ten minutes and my wife\u2019s in the house with our daughter upstairs.
