Let\u2019s call the girl Lea and the boy John.\n\nThey had their birthday yesterday. Since they were turning officially into teens my husband and I decided that we will surprise them with their first cell phone. \n\nSo I went to the Apple Store and bought a 14 pro for my daughter. I knew that she wanted the silver color because she commented on her cousins phone. I had no idea which color my son would prefer. Since his favorite color is blue I bought him a regular 14 in a baby blue color. \n\nYesterday, we had a little birthday party with family members. Lea was the happiest girl in the world when she unboxed her new phone. John was similar exited when the started to unpack his. But \nwhen he was finished with unwrapping he looked at his dad and me with a shocked face and asked why he was getting a regular phone and not the pro version. It was an unpleasant situation in front of everyone. When I said I thought he would like the color he started to yell at me that this is nuts and unfair. He asked if we are f**king kidding him. All of our guests froze. I told him to stop acting like a little brat and that we should enjoy the party now and talk about the phone later. He didn\u2019t say anything and ran to his room. You can imagine the party was over after that. \n\nAfter the guests where gone I stormed into Johns room and confronted him with his behavior. He said go to your beloved daughter and refused to answer me. I informed him that the phone will be returned and that he will get nothing for his birthday. We haven\u2019t talked since than and I won\u2019t talk to him until he apologizes.\n\nNow my Husband thinks I was way to harsh and behaved like an AH when it was clear that I hurt his feelings by buying his sister a more expensive phone.\n\nAITA? I really just did go by color when choosing the phones. Why would I want to hurt my son. But also why can\u2019t his sister a more expensive gift? Do their presents must have the same value everytime?\n\nEdit: \n1. I never favorited my daughter over my son. The ,golden child, claims here are wild to say the least. \n\n2. it was a mistake. I of course knew that the pro was better in some sense but I am not a tech person. I really believed to color would be more important to John. He is into fashion lately and the blue phone just looked very cool imo.\n\n3. I thought about the gift for the two of them! Cell phones just make sense when your kids turn 13. I only knew about my daughters favorite color because she liked her cousins phone so much. It was still  a surprise so I couldn\u2019t ask my son. If I asked something like favorite color etc. the answer would have been blue.", "created_utc": 1688943881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vcril/aita_for_buying_my_daughter_a_better_phone_than/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How did you not expect a teen to react to blatant favouritism.   You should have gotten them the same phone, or gotten him something else to compensate for the difference in price.  Of course you would have noticed there was a fairly sizeable price difference. You could have gotten him one with more storage even.   \n\nYTA also for how you are handling the post-fallout too. Be the adult and communicate properly instead of reacting to his reaction.", "**Why would I want to hurt my son.** \n\nThat's certainly the question here.  You HAD to have noticed the huge discrepancy in price AND features when you bought it--FYI the iPhone 14 Pro comes in blue as well. \n\nIt's bad enough for your son to find out you favor your daughter-- his reaction makes me thing this is your SOP-- but in front of all the people at the party that must have been a pretty bitter pill for your poor son to swallow.  So now he get's no gift at all.  YTA  At least your husband cares about him and his feelings, I hope he takes some comfort in that.", "These sounds more like the straw that broke the camels back, even in the post you admit you don't see problem in expending more in the sister and you don't even knew what he prefered probably because did not ask. You favor the girl a probably this wil create a rift bettewen then", "YTA.  Either child could have bought a case in their preferred color if it was that important to them.  But instead you decided to spend $200 more on one of your twins than the other to get her a superior phone when you knew they would be opening their gifts at the same time and your son would know his gift was lesser than his sister\u2019s.  \n\nYour blatant favoritism isn\u2019t just poisoning your relationship with your son, it\u2019s also going to ruin the relationship between your kids.  Congratulations.", "While his behavior was inappropriate, he is 13. You are an adult who clearly couldn't think ahead that this would cause an issue. YTA.", "YTA.   Your children are twins, and you found out exactly what your daughter wanted, and bought a cheaper version of the same phone for your son without bothering to try to figure out what he might like.   From his behavior, I assume this isn't the first time he's fell like his sister was the heir and he was the unwanted spare.    Do better.   \n\n\nAlso, it's the rare teenaged boy who wants a baby blue phone.   I wouldn't be surprised to find out your son's favorite color isn't even blue anymore.", "YTA. You should have purchased the same models. Even if you didn't intend, it appears you have a favorite. Cases in different colors could easily have solved the problem", "YTA. I can guarantee he would have been more happy with whatever color you bought if it was the same model as his sister. He can buy whatever case he wants, color problem solved.", "YTA. Your sons outburst sounds more like just one more time you favored your daughter over him.  He finally hit his breaking point.", "Twin here. YTA in every way I can possibly think of! From start to finish, you made terrible decisions. It is you who owes him and everyone else an apology. And you need to take a very hard look at how you are treating your children differently. You are going to lose both of them if you don\u2019t change.", "YTA. 100% how you handled it makes you the asshole. He is a child without a fully functioning emotional regulation structure, his outburst was a reaction to being made to feel less than, in front of people no less. He was embarrassed and humiliated and you shamed him for having feelings. Disgusting. Do better as a parent. Apologize and teach your child to emotionally regulate.", "YTA. You know better, I think we all you have a favourite.", "It\u2019s like you purposely set him up and knocked him down. YTA", "YTA\n\nyou made the situation occur.\n\nYou know they were both getting gifts. TWINS.\nHello\n\nWhy would you buy one a \"Pro\"\nAnd the other a regular?\nWhere both of them could see and everyone would literally be able to visibly compare.\n\nShould've bought both the same gift with different phone cover colors.\n\nYou're right. What an awkward and humiliating situation for all parties involved.", "YTA. This would\u2019ve been a perfect opportunity to show your kids what it looks like to mess up as an adult. \u201cYou\u2019re right; I got you this one in an attempt to get you your favorite color phone, but I didn\u2019t take into consideration the differences between the models. I\u2019m sorry, I messed up. I love you and your twin equally and I feel bad that I made you feel otherwise. And on your birthday, too. I\u2019m sorry for all of it. Would you like to exchange the phone?\u201d", "YTA\nPhone color doesn\u2019t even matter as cases cover it most of the time anyway. Clearly you have a favorite and you\u2019re not subtle about it.", "YTA, I\u2019m not a parent, but even I know you have to keep things even when it comes to kids. How do you not know this?", "YTA you\u2019re also the adult. \n\nYou could have calmly explained that you chose a phone in a color he liked but instead you got mad at him for being upset that you got his sister a more expensive phone than his. \n\nWhat was the point in buying the daughter the pro but the son the standard. You either get both the pro or both the standard. There is a huge disparity between the 2 phones. Do you consistently favor the daughter over the son? You clearly chose your daughter\u2019s phone with more intention than your son\u2019s as it seemed more like an after thought, you didn\u2019t even know which color he would like. \n\nYou should apologize to your son for showing blatant favoritism.\n\nEdit: why did you capitalize Daughter but not son?", "I\u2019m reminded of the lady going through a cafeteria line with two small children. She asked for two bowls of Jello and \u201cPlease God make both of them red!\u201d.  \n\nYTA for not understanding how siblings work", "You appear to be lazy and selfish. You bought your daughter what she wanted, had no idea what your son would want so you got a cheaper version of what you bought your daughter. You apparently didn't even pay enough attention to notice it was cheaper. Did the name not give it away? Did you not look at the receipt?\n\nThen at the party, it was all about you, the problems he caused you by being upset at your shitty choices. They're children and twins, of course they're going to compare their gifts! Children are often insecure and will measure themselves against each other. Favouritism as blatant as this will obviously cause an issue.\n\nOf course YTA. It's embarrassing that you have to ask.", "YTA - what do you expect when you blatantly favour one child over the other?", "YTA\n\nYou didn't raise your son to not blow up in front of everyone, and you clearly have a favorite or rocks for brains to not see this coming a mile away getting twins different levels of gift.", "YTA. Your son knows your daughter is your favourite. You just showed him this, again. Enjoy these last few years. I predict NC with your son in the future.", "YTA the iphone 14 pro literally comes in blue, so the excuse of buying it in a color he would like is invalid. Of course he is going to be unhappy that you didn't buy him a pro. It's not the dollar amount it's that you bought him a phone with less features and tried to play it off like it was no big deal.", "In my opinion YTA.", "YTA. Way to announce in front of everyone that your daughter is your favourite/the only thing you wanted to fall out of you.", "Info: Is treating your daughter better a pattern? YTA regardless but I want to know how big of an asshole you are.", "YTA. Hello twin parent. I am also a twin parent. My twins are 4, and I am absurdly aware that they value equality in gifts (and all other things). \n\nI find it incredibly hard to believe that your twins, 9 years older, haven't taught you the same thing. \n\nYou know the phones cost different amounts, you paid for them. Stop punishing your son and apologize and either buy them the same phone or no phone. Punishing him for your mistake is a double down on a bad decision.", "YTA and I call major BS. You had to know that the pro was better than the regular, and if you didn\u2019t know from the names the prices should have tipped you off. You knowingly got you daughter a better and more expensive gift and then got mad when a 13 year old reacted poorly. He just saw that his mother lives his sister more than him, at least that is how he read it, and nothing you have done since has proven that wrong. If you go to him and apologize and explain that it was truly about the color, and offer to return it for a pro or somehow make up the difference he may forgive you and your relationship may recover. If you continue to refuse to act like the adult in the situation, not to mention the person who was wrong, expect for your relationship with your son to suffer.", "YTA. If you're gonna get a present like that, then get them the same thing or not at all. As the only message it sends is that your daughter matters more to you than your son. So you need to use that muscle called a brain and start being more considerate towards your son. Starting with an apology for being a massive AH.", "My kids are not twins but I still wouldn\u2019t do that! They are two years apart and get treated equally. Why the hell are you punishing him for the way YOU made him feel???? \nYTA, do better.", "YTA. You went by color instead of features and ended up giving your son a \"lesser\" gift. There were several ways to handle this equitably: You could have given them an IOU for a phone of their choice, or you could have asked them if color or features mattered more, or you could have given your son the phone plus the price difference in cash. You didn't do any of those things. Instead you gave your daughter a much better gift and made your son feel inferior in front of everyone. Now he and everyone else have seen proof positive that you love your daughter more than him and don't care how public you are with your favoritism. \n\nOn top of that, you fucking punished him for calling you out for showing favoritism.\n\nWhat's your punishment for making your son feel unimportant on his own birthday?\n\nThis was an utter failure at parenting.\n\nComplete and absolute failure.", "\u201cI won\u2019t talk to him until he apologizes\u201d \n\nYTA. Are you the adult or the teen? You really sat down at 41 and said you\u2019re going to ignore your son until he apologizes?! \n\nHe\u2019s upset at the unfair slight and the first thing you do is publicly call him a brat. Then instead of calming down and talking to him rationally you storm into him room and lay into him. Then you punish him for his emotions and your mistake. At 13 wouldn\u2019t you have had years of understanding your kids to see that as twins they definitely need to have equal valued gifts? \n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious by this post and your comments at the end that your son is right about your \u201cbeloved daughter\u201d. \n\nYeah sounds like a great parenting day for you!", "Yta- yes that's unfair. Kind of reminds me of that old music video called '[shoes](https://youtu.be/c0DVrRw9aGk)'. Do you want to be those parents?!?", "YTA.\n\nCould your 13 year old have handled it better, probably, but you know\u2026 he\u2019s a child. You however are the adult and should have known you can\u2019t get away with spending $200 or on one kids phone and not the other, especially TWINS. \n\nYour husband is right.", "YTA\n\nWhen it's their first cell phones, you bet your ass.  \n\nSomeone should take away your \"Mom\" card.  Colour preference my Aunt Fanny.  Liar.", "YTA.   \"How to show favoritism to kids\" is in full effect here (in their eyes, even if you thought he'd appreciate the color more.", "YTA. OP knew what phone her daughter wanted. OP never even asked her son what he'd like. The gift was selected with her daughter in mind. The son was an afterthought. The son's reaction was out of line, but he wasn't wrong at all. Own that you messed up and make it right, don't double down and further prove your son to be right", "YTA, and a sorry excuse for a parent. Why do I get the feeling this was not the first time you shortchanged your son. Perhaps it was his excessive reaction - \"go to your beloved daughter.\"  I don't think that comes from only one incident. Also - \"but why can't his sister have a more expensive gift?'  You are showing your BLATANT favoritism. Maybe you should listen to the commentariat and your husband, and reassess your behavior.", "> Since his favorite color is blue I bought him a regular 14 in a baby blue color. \n\n\nThat's one of the stupidest things I ever heard. What does favourite colour has do with which product are you getting? Did you really think that getting a lesser product is fine beacuse of the Color? I'm sure he would be fine with the same phone in silver, even if it's not his favourite colour. What is wrong with you? YTA\n\n\nAnd just to make it clear: you first choose a product (and since buying gifts for two people, two copies of that product), then choose a colour from the available options. You're buying a phone, not a Color.", "YTA, they could've both been black or whatever, and then the color could be the cases... because phones break when dropped and cases are a really good investment.\n\nWho wants to bet that mom let's the daughter get away with everything, and son only gets the scraps of whats let behind?", "YTA. You should have bought him a basic black color and a blue case. Or you should have gotten your daughter the same model he has.", "Simply put you should of got them the same phone either would of done as long as they're the same it really looks like you playing favourites.. He shouldn't shouldn't of flew of the handle is can understand why he feels the he way he does if you're giving out preferential treatment to on of your children", "Intent takes a back seat to impact. Stop thinking about your intent. Hate to break it to you, but your intent is largely irrelevant when the execution of that intent results in a negative impact. Start thinking about the impact of your decisions.\n\nDid you mean to make your son feel less valuable, less loved, less considered, less <whatever> than your daughter. Was that your plan? Obviously not.\n\nBut.\n\nYou.\n\nDid.\n\nNow, you are not actually responsible for the emotions created by another person, but you do have influence, your behaviors will have impact, and you are the parent. It is your job to teach your kids through these moments not punish them for having fairly predictable reactions to actions are likely to generate the perception of disproportionality or disparity between twins. You failed here.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, you bought him a lesser present than his twin sister.  Dress it up however you like, call him a brat for not appreciating an expensive gift, but you are the one who did this deliberately, and had him open it in front of everyone.  I don't blame him for being upset that a display of favouritism embarrassed him.  Given that you had no idea which colour he would prefer, that wouldn't be more important than making things equal.  You can get gifts of different value if they have the same significance behind them, but if it's the exact same thing, can you not see how this would be hurtful?\n\nFrom his reaction, yes it was over-the-top, so is there anything else going on, like other moments where he feels put aside and this was maybe a build-up of everything?", "YTA.

And you expect an apology from him! And are giving him the silent treatment. I just. Can\u2019t. Wow.\n\nOf course you\u2019re the AH. And his reaction, both to the present and when you came into his room, suggests this is a pattern, not a once-off.", "YTA  Congratulations!  You gave your son a memory of his 13th birthday that will last a lifetime!  That was the day you made it clear who your favorite was.  \n\nYou need to apologize to John, and you need to make this right.  Yes, that phone does need to be returned and he needs to be there to see it.  It needs to be returned in favor of a 14 Pro, and John should be there so he can select a case if he wants one.", "YTA. I can\u2019t believe you actually think it\u2019s ok to buy your daughter a more expensive phone when they are twins! I feel bad for your son.

He wouldn't have cared what color the damn phone was and you know it. Stop acting obtuse. He's 14!!! Of course he was going to think you favor your daughter because she got the more expensive gift and they're raised in the technology era.

How hard would it have been to buy him the phone in black?! Then gotten them whatever case color they wanted? I don't know a single person who doesn't have a phone case.", "YTA BIG TIME. Getting your kids their first phones for a present, you should have gotten the same phone for both, regardless of color. You can buy cases for most phones in most colors. The way your son reacted, I agree with others that this probably wasn't the first time something like this has happened. \n\nTo answer your question about the value of gifts being the same, it depends, but the total value of gifts should be as close to equal as possible. Example: one kid is into reading and the other into drawing/painting. Books and art supplies have different values, so if you buy 2 books for the kid who likes to read, spending $40, you should spend roughly the same amount on art supplies.", "Rest assured everyone that was their realizes the blatant favoritism, and your talked about your problems later among themselves.

Kids at 13 know exactly the different types of phones. You bought him a baby blue Toyota Camry and your daughter a silver Corvette. Seriously. You were wrong, so very wrong.

I said of course!\n\nOne of my nephews brought over a little plushie toy that fit in my palm of a cartoon character, and said one of his brothers really liked that character. \n\nNow, the boys are getting big water guns. But they were thinking about what their brother liked. \n\nSo I told him \"Well, if he likes the character I think this is a good idea, but do you think you'd feel a little left out if you got this and your brothers got the water guns?\"\n\nHe thought about it for a second, then he said \"Yeah, cause the guns are big\"\n\nHe went and picked out something else he liked just as well. \n\nYour son may like the color, but it's obvious there's a difference in the gift.

For you to then punish him for his reaction instead of having a moment of reflection and trying to understand why he reacted that way is just reinforcing the reason that everyone is saying you favour your daughter.

You may want to think back and determine if this is a common problem. Do you often find your daughter easier to shop for than your son? There is nothing wrong with that, but he may have caught on that her gifts are more suited to her than his are to him.

That reaction probably needs far more attention by you with the help of a counselor.", ">Do their presents must have the same value everytime?\n\nYes and not because they are twins, but because they are your children.\n\nMy parents always make sure that our gifts have the same value to avoid jealousy between siblings (since all their children are girls).\n\nHow he acted is unacceptable and he should apologize. But so are you and explain in a calm manner the situation instead of punishing him (not getting a gift at all).\n\nYou also said you don't want to hurt your son intentionally. I believe you. But clearly, your son knows you're playing favoritism. This statement makes me believe it \"*But also why can\u2019t his sister a more expensive gift? Do their presents must have the same value everytime?*\" ESH.", "YTA.  Twins should get the same presents or at least the same spent on them.   You knew the Pro was better and did not buy something extra for the other one to make up.  Not understanding this amazes me,", "YTA. \n\nAs the adult you should have seen this coming. \n\nYour tech ignorance is no excuse. \n\n\nYou have taught your son a life lesson he will never forget, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the life lesson you intended to teach. \n\nI don\u2019t even think you can fix this. It\u2019s THAT bad.", "ESH\n\nWtf? Why would you buy a better phone to one of them? Even if you knew he wanted the blue colour and that was only possible in the cheaper version you shouldn't have bought him the cheaper version. But that's not even the case, you just bought something cheaper because you liked the colour. Wtf?\n\nHe's completely right being upset with you. However, he needs to understand how to express himself and what he did when he opened the gift is definitely not OK and he needs to learn that lesson (I don't think not giving him anything for his birthday is the way to go though).", "Yta for favouriting and getting them different phones in the first place", "Parenting is hard. Intentions being pure, you're not an AH for trying to please your son by getting him a color he'd like, regardless of the fact that the color would likely be covered with a case. I think your son is and was clearly feeling hurt and, although his reaction was over the top and the timing was poor, your follow-up reaction may reflect where he gets his coping skills. From this scenario, he's feeling less than or not as important or some other negative feelings. You love your son and want him to be certain, without any doubt, that you love him and his sister as much as humanly possible and no matter what they do that will never change. His actions, however, need to be addressed in a loving but stearn manner (For example... I'm sorry, I honestly thought you'd like the blue better and i truly wanted to make you happy. I'm also sorry for my reaction when I said you won't get anything for your birthday and I'm sorry I haven't talked this out with you sooner. Maybe we can try to exchange the blue one for the pro. We do need to address your behavior, too, of cussing in front of guests and storming off during your party. That's not okay. We both messed up. What consequences seem fair here?) Now mom, I know it's hard to hear but leaving him to feel less worthy of the pro than his sister and then following up with the silent treatment until he apologizes is an AH move and just solidifying what he's already feeling and thinking. You're the adult. You love your son. Make the first move.", "Yta! Yes they should be the same value when it\u2019s the same present. Your son is spot on with your favouritism. Why wouldn\u2019t you get the same phones and then get him a blue phone case?", "Also like completely giving it back and giving him no present at all for his birthday is just not right. Take it away until he apologizes is one thing but to say you  get nothing? At all? Punishment does not fit the crime.", "YTA \n\nWas there not a 14 pro you could've bought in a different color for your son? Are you that goddamn dense?", "I didn't even have to read the body.

There is no reason you couldn\u2019t get your son and daughter the same type of phone considering phones are almost always in covers.\n\nYou can give your son and daughter different expense gift usually if it\u2019s tailored to their individual preferences, but it\u2019s best to keep as similar as possible and both your children want phones. I would be upset too if my siblings got a better phone than me as a gift. It comes across as favoritism even if that wasn\u2019t your intention. \n\nPeople sometimes correlate presents with their worth or love.

Get them both the same and your lame argument about not being tech savvy doesn't fly. You still realize one cost more than the other.

YTA.\n\nThat signals something pretty hurtful to a kid.\n\nHe cant talk to you like that - the swearing is insane - but, his feelings make sense. You valued color, but he saw the actual value of the product and gift and it\u2019s capabilities.\n\nYou need to explain to him calmly that you do not know the difference between iPhone pro and iPhone, and thought he would like the blue because of his fashion interest. That you love him so much, not less than his sister. You will take him to get a pro, but he absolutely can\u2019t swear at you, and if he does, he loses the phone.\n\nYou need to be really aware and wake up to the fact that gifts for twins - and for everything with twins -  equality is important. \n\nThink of it this way:\n\n- If you got your daughter a nicer car because you knew the color she\u2019d like, and got a less expensive one for your son because \u201cit\u2019s blue\u201d\u2026 like think about that\u2026that\u2019s how he felt. YWBTA\n\n- Or, if you paid for your daughter to go to a more expensive school because you knew she really wanted to go there, and chose a less expensive one for him because you \u201cknew he liked football and they have a team\u201d, YWBTA.\n\nAnd THEN, if you gave the car or college fund to the kids in front of the entire family \u2026 can you IMAGINE how humiliating and hurtful that would be????\n\nTo a 13 year old, a phone is like college or a car.\n\nAnd you can say you don\u2019t play favorites, but you demonstrated higher value to your daughter, and less value for the gift you got your son, It doesn\u2019t matter if YOU don\u2019t think you have a favorite. You literally demonstrated higher value of one kid\u2019s birthday gift over the others. It is what it is. \n\nDo better. \n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what your son would like, find out. Literally your job is to know about your kids, and if one is less demonstrative you find a way to understand their likes, dislikes, interests. And for god\u2019s sake you don\u2019t get one twin a nicer gift than the other. The fact you didn\u2019t think that would be hurtful suggests you\u2019re incredibly checked out when it comes to your sons feelings. The fact it would be hurtful is OBVIOUS. How did you miss that? \n\n\u201cKids I read about this thing called iPhone pro. What\u2019s the difference? It\u2019s so confusing.\u201d Asking that would have given you the info you need.\n\nNot knowing tech is not an excuse.

The only disagreement was how she handled his outburst; imo no 13 yo (and younger) should be given the latest anything regarding technology, but that\u2019s just me. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with an ESH. You and your husband could have at least asked your son what color he would like out of the pros w/o clueing him in on the gift (\u201chey out of these colors, which do you like best?\u201d) and that would\u2019ve solved your problem then and there or you could\u2019ve gotten him the same one as his sister (they *should* be getting cases for protection anyways so any \u201csense of style\u201d would be more in that area). \n\nYour son, however, did not need to have that reaction at that given moment, but he\u2019s 13 and thought something was unfair and reacted the way he did.

No, it could\u2019ve been handled better, but that\u2019s your job as a parent to help him navigate through these emotions *without having to punish him for his emotions*.  \n\nThis situation itself isn\u2019t a serious issue, but it is giving light on how your son feels. If he\u2019s saying his sister is the \u201cgolden child\u201d there\u2019s most likely more going on than we (or even you and your husband) know about, and it\u2019s your guys\u2019 job as his parents to deal with it by having an open conversation with him as to why he feels this way. And please refrain from shutting down what he has to say or arguing against it, kids/teens can\u2019t control how they feel, but as adults we can control how *we* respond. Prove to your son you do care for him as equally as his sister and listen to what he has to say (and maybe give him an upgrade while you\u2019re at it).", "ESH. Ehh both of yall suck. Both you shouldn't have acted like that. Ik you acted genuinely and weren't trying to give him the lesser iPhone model but c'mon . He could have acted better too , I didn't even get a new phone till I was 15 and it was no iPhone either it was a cheap Android that I still use .

Let\u2019s call the girl Lea and the boy John.\n\nThey had their birthday yesterday. Since they were turning officially into teens my husband and I decided that we will surprise them with their first cell phone. \n\nSo I went to the Apple Store and bought a 14 pro for my daughter. I knew that she wanted the silver color because she commented on her cousins phone. I had no idea which color my son would prefer. Since his favorite color is blue I bought him a regular 14 in a baby blue color. \n\nYesterday, we had a little birthday party with family members. Lea was the happiest girl in the world when she unboxed her new phone. John was similar exited when the started to unpack his. But \nwhen he was finished with unwrapping he looked at his dad and me with a shocked face and asked why he was getting a regular phone and not the pro version. It was an unpleasant situation in front of everyone. When I said I thought he would like the color he started to yell at me that this is nuts and unfair. He asked if we are f**king kidding him. All of our guests froze. I told him to stop acting like a little brat and that we should enjoy the party now and talk about the phone later. He didn\u2019t say anything and ran to his room. You can imagine the party was over after that. \n\nAfter the guests where gone I stormed into Johns room and confronted him with his behavior. He said go to your beloved daughter and refused to answer me. I informed him that the phone will be returned and that he will get nothing for his birthday. We haven\u2019t talked since than and I won\u2019t talk to him until he apologizes.\n\nNow my Husband thinks I was way to harsh and behaved like an AH when it was clear that I hurt his feelings by buying his sister a more expensive phone.\n\nAITA? I really just did go by color when choosing the phones. Why would I want to hurt my son. But also why can\u2019t his sister a more expensive gift? Do their presents must have the same value everytime?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why would you think the color of all things is more important than all of the features and the screen size? This was really unfair of you. Whether you meant to or not, you favored your daughter over him. Shame on you.", "Methinks this isn't necessarily about the phone; it was just what set him off. It's been building for a while. Some kids can be brats, yes, but from how OP explained it, it was pretty out of character. It sounds like he snapped.\n\nOP should have been more intentional in figuring out what the son would like before buying something as expensive as an iphone and gotten them the same model. Gifts aren't about the dollar amount, but if you have two kids with the same birthday who are opening gifts that are essentially the same thing right next to each other? Yeah. That's noticable.\n\nYTA. Talk to your kid.", "This is why I always buy my kids the exact same same thing. They would got the exact color and then been able to choose a phone case. Now as far as his behavior. Id still get the phone but he is definitely grounded for a certain period from the new phone. Even at 19 18 17 16 I still buy all my kids the exact same thing. I couldn't stand favoritism as a child.", "YTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s really about colour (which it isn\u2019t) the 14 regular comes on starlight which is basically silver. \n\nI\u2019m a twin mom and this is absolutely bonkers to me.", "YTA.\n\nYou realize that most people put cases on them, right?

You should know by now that if you are getting a similar item, you get them both the same item, same color EVERYTHING. that way there\u2019s no favoritism or fighting. \nIt would be different if she wanted a phone and he wanted a ps5 or something, but if you\u2019re getting them both a phone, you get them BOTH the same phone.", "YTA. You don\u2019t give siblings different phones at the same time. That\u2019s just asking for the reaction you got \u2014 your son was hurt!

Of course he was upset.", "YTA... but you will never admit it. \nYou should 1st apologize to your son, then go get the right phone. Then get into family therapy and individual therapy.

My oldest son received a gizmo watch at 6, my middle is about to get his in a few months. Hell, down to pictures on display I make sure they are even and equally displayed. Even stevens is the name of the game and considering you have TWINS it should be easy.

Why is that, do you think?", "You should\u2019ve bought the same phone, but you know that now. If my teenage son yelled the f-bomb at me at his birthday party, I\u2019d return the gift and probably take away a few more things. He owes you an apology.

If you were going purely by colour, you also *knew* your daughter liked silver, (as opposed to the blue you \"thought\" your son would like) so why didn't you get her the silver version of the blue one you got your son? Despite your claim of not favoring your daughter, your son's reaction *strongly* suggests this isn't the first time she got something better.  You said you're aware the phone you got your daughter is better, but you're \"not a tech person\". Get out of here with that bullshit.  Better is better, you knew it, and you consciously chose better for your daughter.  Do you even like your son?

You told him you were going to take away his phone altogether, so I guess you will, but what kind of parent gives a one twin a lesser gift, except for one who has favorites?

You owe him in apology and your husband owes him one if he also didn\u2019t validate his feelings.", "YTA.\n\nUnlike others here, I don't think you favour your daughter over your son. I think you're just tech-clueless and have no idea why one phone would be 200 dollars more, or why you shouldn't choose a piece of technology based on its colour. \n\nUnfortunately your 13-year-old is not going to make this distinction. He knows one is better than the other, he knows one costs more than the other, he knows mom spent 200 dollars more on his sister. Of course he was upset and confused and angry. He probably didn't know your single criteria was color, and if he did it wouldn't help, because it's not the right criteria for a tech purchase. He's also 13, an age where emotional regulation and impulse control aren't finished developing yet, and he struggled to manage a big disappointment and hurt in front of others.\n\nThe way he acted was out of line for everyday behaviour, but imo you can't blame a kid for their emotional reaction to your mistake, and this was your mistake. If you make a mistake that would anger a reasonable adult, it's on you, and you can't blame a kid for not handling it like an adult, because he's not one.\n\nYour reaction to this incident should have been \"Oh no, I'm so sorry, I had no idea one was better than the other, I just thought you'd like the colour. We can go and replace it later/tomorrow, it's no problem. I meant to get you both the same one.\" \n\n>But also why can\u2019t his sister a more expensive gift? Do their presents must have the same value everytime?\n\nHonestly, yes. This is a very well-established parenting fact. Especially for twins. Kids will subconsciously question and monitor their bond with their parents, it's natural; buying them gifts of notably different value will absolutely give them cause to feel insecure and wonder if there is a favourite child. \n\n(Hell, I'm not even a twin, but I'm a 35-yo woman and my mom still agonises over spending the same amount on me and my 34-yo sister.)\n\nI know you said you're waiting on an apology from your son but I honestly think you're the one who should be apologising to him. You made the mistakes here, not him. His anger and hurt are justified, he is too young to know how to manage them yet, and it's not his fault that you created a bad situation.", "YTA\n\nYou obviously favor your daughter.  \n\n> I knew that she wanted the silver color because she commented on her cousins phone. I had no idea which color my son would prefer.\n\n***THEN ASK***. \n\nYou took the time to find out exactly what your daughter wanted but didn't take two seconds to figure out what your son wanted.  \n\nThen punished him when he was right about the favoritism.", "YTA", "Nta. Your son is a spoilt brat, but there's an easy easy through this; sit him down and ask him to list the differences between the pro and standard model. This is a big issue for him, so don't worry, he'll know them. Then ask him to walk you through why these features are essential to the point of him being able to justify his behaviour. Obviously there's some great health issue you don't know about that requires him to have slightly more memory on his phone, and a minimally better camera. Having explained this issue to you, poorly ask your little Warhol if he'd mind showing you his portfolio. Clearly the budding artist is a photographer looking to expand his digital portfolio. Express deep interest in this; it's his passion after all. Bring it up as often as you can - dinner, public outings, family events. Tell his cousins, uncles, grandparents. Build expectations. Don't worry, his behaviour has already indicated that his is a talent with unforeseen potential. After months (at least 8) of building up the expectations everyone in his life have of him, present him with the iPhone pro, and apologise for standing in the way of his creative potential.

Do you see a strong loving mother looking back at you? I bet you don\u2019t, if you really look hard enough with enough honesty. \n\nApologize SINCERELY to your son and correct this mistake YOU MADE immediately. I speak from experience when I say that if you don\u2019t, this IS the final straw in your already paper thing relationship and in a short few years from now you will be wondering why your son has completely disappeared from your life.\n\nEdit: verdict", "Honestly i don't agree with your sons reaction. I was afraid to act like that, but YOU ARE THE ADULT. Refusing to talk to your son AS HIS PARENT is extremely childish and only shows him that your love and attention is conditional.

You're mad he embarrassed you in front of everyone.", "Why are you apologising for your mistake on HIS birthday. Being a parent does not magically exclude you for being wring. You caused this whole situation, it\u2019s  to you to apologise and make it right. Just because you dint like being called out for your screwup is no reason to punish your son. The lesson he\u2019s learning from you here is not the one you think it is.", "Apologize yourself. You were wrong, deeply wrong, and that's that. His behavior wasn't good, but two wrongs don't make a right, and you don't get to avoid an apology just because he didn't behave perfectly. \n\nBuy him the same exact phone as his sister, in blue if that's his color. Give him the phone and apologize. Apologise profusely for ruining his joy on his birthday, and for giving the impression you love his sister more. Explain it's not true, and give specific insights into your thinking (a challenge here, because I honestly don't get it). Do all that without making excuses for your behavior. \n\n*Then* tell him he also messed up at the party and swearing isn't ok. Depending on his response, and if you want to be an *extra* stickler, tell him the time between his b-day and getting the phone were his punishment for the swearing.

Whether you realize it or not your son does realize it", "It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly the same, but a $200 difference means that you should have gotten him a second gift and realized that there is probably a reason other than color that hers cost so much more. Your kids aren\u2019t looking at your receipts but gifts should be approximately equal value.", "Dude, ofc they dont have to have the same value when the gifts are not comparable. But firstly, they are twins lol. I compared myself with my older bro all the time I am sure he did too. I can only imagine the twins do too, and if they don't, I guarantee randos around the world will wonder if they do more than non twin siblings. \n\nImagine getting your son and daughter matching t shits and pants. But then you also give your son the exact hat, watch, and shoes to go with the outfit and wonder why the kids are upset at the difference in value?\n\nHoly shit, imagine knowing one child's favorite cereal is Frosted Flakes, then getting their twin an OFF brand version of the other one's favorite cereal lmao. Its double bad bc you knew what to get your daughter and didn't know the exact gift of your son so you got him a less impressive version of gift you knew your daughter wanted.\n\nEven if you truly cannot see how this would blow up, how can you blame him after you are made aware by him or a 5 sec google search how vastly different those phones are, especially in the eyes of kids, ESPECIALLY IN THE EYES OF TWINS lol.\n\nEven if he got upset at hte gift, and you immediately apologized and swapped the gifts, I would still fell so bad for the kid. I would not think you were the AH necessarily just shows you don't put a lot of thought other than color into gifts lol. But the fact you got upset at him..\n\nCan you imagine a young twin/teen going to school and being like \"I GOT THIS AWESOME IPHONE FROM MY PARENTS FOR MY BDAY\", and then the other twin going \"I GOT THIS LESS AWESOME ONE!\".

They all hate pastel colors.   I wasn't really thinking 'pastels are for girls!' so much as 'none of my boys and none of their male friends tend to like lighter colors.'  My boys tend to gravitate towards either bold colors or darker hues.  My niece wants everything pastel.  I don't think the light blue is unmasculine, but rather a color I don't think any of my teenagers would choose.  I mean, they'd take the new phone regardless of color--I think they're still using iphone 6 or 7--but if they were CHOOSING a color, I don't think they'd go for a pastel. \n\nWhat bothered me about the OP's post the most was that she knew exactly which phone her daughter wanted down to the color, but had NO idea what her son wanted.  She just bought him the same thing she bought her daughter, only a cheaper version and 'I'm pretty sure he likes blue so I'll just go with that' rather than spending some time over the past year trying to figure out what her son might like for his birthday.  No wonder he was upset.", "The color is just a lame excuse she is using to justify her blatant favoritism", "It is highly unlikely that this was the first time good ole mom demonstrated that she favors the daughter over the son so no wonder the kid erupted at being humiliated and made to feel less than.
