{"id": 15972, "submission_id": "132ppkn", "title": "AITA for threatening to file a restraining order against my parents?", "selftext": "My (22M) parents are nut jobs. I have two siblings, Diana (19F) and Luke (8M). My parents are 50M and 45F. \n\nMy parents HEAVILY favored my brother and I over our sister. Luke and I were showered in pocket money, gifts etc while Diana was expected to get a job as soon as it was legal for her to do so. They claimed they wanted to raise her to be strong and independent, but both of them have said they wished they had three sons because girls 'join their husbands family and leave their parents behind so having them isn't worthwhile'. My mother's pregnancy with Diana was also very difficult and the damage that is caused meant that she had many miscarriages while trying to have Luke, all of which were blamed on Diana. Yes, I did stand up for Diana as much as I could until I moved out for college at 17. I tried to get other family members involved but my parents are amazing at pretending they're not evil. \n\nAs soon as Diana turned 18 in July 2021, she moved out. Like on the evening of her 18th birthday I was receiving calls from my parents asking me if I knew where she was because she had disappeared. She had moved in with her friend Savannah's family and a few months later she started dating Savannah's older brother Michael in November 2021 (25M) and she moved in with him in February 2022. Savannah's family adore my sister and they were happy that she was dating their son and I know nothing was going on before Diana was 18 because Michael lived abroad until September 2021. \n\nMy parents disowned Diana in August 2021 when it became clear she wasn't moving back in with them and they haven't asked me about her either. Now they're constantly harassing me to get them back into contact with her because they found out that she gave birth to her daughter at the beginning of this month. I didn't speak to them much after Diana moved out because they make me sick but I still wanted to keep in touch with Luke, but the harassment has gotten relentless. They are demanding that I get Diana to speak to them because they have a right to know their granddaughter. They've showed up to my job and home which scared me as I live with my boyfriend, and my family don't know that I'm into men. I don't know if they're homophobic, but their behaviour scares me nonetheless.\n\nThat prompted me to look into restraining orders and I think it'll be possible to get one against them. Yesterday, they showed up to my home again and I answered the door, and told them very plainly, that they weren't owed access to Diana's child and that I was going to get a restraining order against them if they didn't stop harassing me. My grandmother called me that evening to tell me how heartless I was being because I was denying them access to 2/3 of their children (myself and Diana). She said that threatening to 'sever family relationships' wasn't the way, and I was being a horrible person for not allowing them the option to reconcile with Diana. My grandmother is a very sensible person so now I'm started to feel like I've gone too far.

You should get Diana to do the same if she's okay with being around them in court for the process. Keep being an amazing big brother.", "Big ole NTA. First thing, your sister wanted to go no contact with your parents. That's her decision, she complete control over who she includes in her life. Second thing, you have no obligation to mend your parents' relationship with your sister and the fact that they are demanding that you do it, is a great example of how their parenting terribly. Third, your commitment to your sister is admirable, I'd like to assume that your relationship is one of the support pillars that gave her the strength to stick to her guns and decide WHO her family is. I might be reaching but your grandmother siding with your parents does not come off as sensible. I feel like grandparents are distant enough to the the main family  that they usually pick up on macro family dynamics, ie favorites and things like that, and go out of their way to make that child feel loved. Did she do that? I'd have to assume probably not. The fact that she completely ignores Diana's feelings, to justify FORCING reconciliation, seems like she might have played a part in enabling the worst aspects of your parents. The fact that they feel entitled to reconciliation without considering Diana's feelings makes me think that the child might be better off with limited contact. Don't cave OP,  it might sour your relationship with your parents/grandparents, but your sister needs you.", "NTA, the audacity of your parents...", "NTA - very toxic parents. If they want to see Diana and her baby, they should negotiate with Diana, not try and involve you in a triangulation.

Involving grandma is just more triangulation. Set a clear boundary with the order.

Putting you in the middle does nothing but give them someone to blame, which I guess is easier than acknowledging their own role.", "NTA. I can\u2019t diagnose your parents, but what I can say is that your parents exhibit toxic traits associated with NPD disorder coupled with the family dynamic being almost to a T of what narcissistic family dynamics are. It\u2019s not uncommon (pretty much the standard) for Narc/Toxic parents to have golden children that they treat kindly (coupled with praise and indulging that child) while also having a blacksheep/truth telling child that they emotionally abuse, emotionally neglect and just plain neglect (physical and other forms of abuse are not outside of the possibilities either) which forced that child to become very independent and reserved from an early age. \n\nDon\u2019t give your sisters location up for anything. They are so enthralled in this idea that they are entitled to your sister\u2019s daughter that once they know where Diana is, they will start harassing her, but probably even more than they are harassing you now. The trauma this could cause for Diana and your niece could be long lasting and would damage your relationship with her. Additionally, based on my experience they might attempt to get Grandparents rights (AKA visitation or full custody enforced by the court) and/or might call COS on Diana for no reason other than to get grandparents rights. I know this sounds like a stretch and I\u2019m not saying this would definitely happen, because, again, I don\u2019t know your parents personally. This is just based on my experience having worked as a family law paralegal. \n\nOP, your parents are using a manipulative tactic against you called informally flying monkey. They did this by essentially using your grandmother to guilt trip and gas light you into giving up your sisters location, because they are condemning you for splitting up the family when it was THEM that did that, not you. Let it be known that once you give up Diana\u2019s location-you will be her flying monkey. \n\nHere is an excerpt I have found about flying-monkeys and their purpose online: \u201cThe purpose of recruiting flying monkeys is to get enough people onboard with the narcissist's narrative so the victim has no choice but to abandon theirs. The usage of flying monkeys is an elite form of triangulation because the narcissist is essentially making a one-on-one feud a two or more-on-one feud.\u201d\n\nIf you wish to get a restraining order, as someone who worked in a domestic violence and youth shelter, here\u2019s some helpful tips. 1. Document that you have told your parents to stop all contact with you. Send it to them via multiple methods (text, email, mail) and if they respond, document that as well. It would be very beneficial for court purposes to get this done via certified mail, that way they have to sign their names with the mail carrier present (which the carrier then hands back to you) in order for them to receive the letter stating that you don\u2019t want to them to contact you anymore. 2. Inform you boss/HR that if your parents show up at your work again, that they are not to interact with you. I know this can be touchy because some work places are in At-Will states and would rather just fire you than deal with the drama, but if you feel like your in a position to do this-then do it. Because not only will it prevent your parents from harassing you there, but you can also request that when it does happen that the HR/Administration documents it-and like that not only do you have documentation from a reputable source, you got witnesses! 3. Cameras-if you feel it necessary. Lots of Harassers/stalkers take their victims/children setting boundaries as a green light to up their game. The stalking increases, the flying monkeys and manipulation tactics increase. They start showing up at your house more and more. Cameras document this. 4. Anytime they breach the clearly communicated no-contact, document it as well (time, place, date and any evidence.) This will make getting the restraining order at court 100x easier for you. 5. Find a Pro Bono attorney. Although it might not be needed, these are the kinds of cases that Pro Bono Attorneys and Pro Bono law students salivate for-IF you can show them the amount of evidence you have. \nThe point being, if you want that restraining order, document every little thing you can. \nBut you need to be prepared for the fact that you won\u2019t have a relationship with your parents, and that, more likely than not, you will be the new black sheep of the family. A smear campaign will ensue forthright, and they will use tactics to harm you, because they can no longer do it to your sister. This is because your sister was their punching bag, and now that she is gone, they require someone else to be the lightening rod\u2014> hence why your the new target. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m so sorry you, your sister and brother are going through this. A restraining order would take away your chance to have your brother in your life, so I know deciding to get a restraining order or not to will be a difficult to decision. Nobody can tell you how to make that decision-it\u2019s something you alone will have to decide. However, keep in mind this harassment will probably not stop until your parents get their sights back on Diana.
