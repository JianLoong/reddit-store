{"id": 15972, "submission_id": "132ppkn", "title": "AITA for threatening to file a restraining order against my parents?", "selftext": "My (22M) parents are nut jobs. I have two siblings, Diana (19F) and Luke (8M). My parents are 50M and 45F. \n\nMy parents HEAVILY favored my brother and I over our sister. Luke and I were showered in pocket money, gifts etc while Diana was expected to get a job as soon as it was legal for her to do so. They claimed they wanted to raise her to be strong and independent, but both of them have said they wished they had three sons because girls 'join their husbands family and leave their parents behind so having them isn't worthwhile'. My mother's pregnancy with Diana was also very difficult and the damage that is caused meant that she had many miscarriages while trying to have Luke, all of which were blamed on Diana. Yes, I did stand up for Diana as much as I could until I moved out for college at 17. I tried to get other family members involved but my parents are amazing at pretending they're not evil. \n\nAs soon as Diana turned 18 in July 2021, she moved out. Like on the evening of her 18th birthday I was receiving calls from my parents asking me if I knew where she was because she had disappeared. She had moved in with her friend Savannah's family and a few months later she started dating Savannah's older brother Michael in November 2021 (25M) and she moved in with him in February 2022. Savannah's family adore my sister and they were happy that she was dating their son and I know nothing was going on before Diana was 18 because Michael lived abroad until September 2021. \n\nMy parents disowned Diana in August 2021 when it became clear she wasn't moving back in with them and they haven't asked me about her either. Now they're constantly harassing me to get them back into contact with her because they found out that she gave birth to her daughter at the beginning of this month. I didn't speak to them much after Diana moved out because they make me sick but I still wanted to keep in touch with Luke, but the harassment has gotten relentless. They are demanding that I get Diana to speak to them because they have a right to know their granddaughter. They've showed up to my job and home which scared me as I live with my boyfriend, and my family don't know that I'm into men. I don't know if they're homophobic, but their behaviour scares me nonetheless.\n\nThat prompted me to look into restraining orders and I think it'll be possible to get one against them. Yesterday, they showed up to my home again and I answered the door, and told them very plainly, that they weren't owed access to Diana's child and that I was going to get a restraining order against them if they didn't stop harassing me. My grandmother called me that evening to tell me how heartless I was being because I was denying them access to 2/3 of their children (myself and Diana). She said that threatening to 'sever family relationships' wasn't the way, and I was being a horrible person for not allowing them the option to reconcile with Diana. My grandmother is a very sensible person so now I'm started to feel like I've gone too far.

Then they harass you to get them back into her life because she now has something they want access to  (granddaughter) and wonder why you look into a RO?

You should get Diana to do the same if she's okay with being around them in court for the process. Keep being an amazing big brother.", "Big ole NTA. First thing, your sister wanted to go no contact with your parents. That's her decision, she complete control over who she includes in her life. Second thing, you have no obligation to mend your parents' relationship with your sister and the fact that they are demanding that you do it, is a great example of how their parenting terribly. Third, your commitment to your sister is admirable, I'd like to assume that your relationship is one of the support pillars that gave her the strength to stick to her guns and decide WHO her family is. I might be reaching but your grandmother siding with your parents does not come off as sensible. I feel like grandparents are distant enough to the the main family  that they usually pick up on macro family dynamics, ie favorites and things like that, and go out of their way to make that child feel loved. Did she do that? I'd have to assume probably not. The fact that she completely ignores Diana's feelings, to justify FORCING reconciliation, seems like she might have played a part in enabling the worst aspects of your parents. The fact that they feel entitled to reconciliation without considering Diana's feelings makes me think that the child might be better off with limited contact.

Involving grandma is just more triangulation. Set a clear boundary with the order.

Terribly sad, yes.\n\nShe's never been protected or taught about her self worth, so of course she ran for an inappropriate relationship.\n\nI wish OP could have been more of a support for her.", "Not only that, but they started dating when she was 18 and living with his family", "Did their mom \" leave her family\" when she married and had the three of them? Did they not get to see their maternal grandparents? My husband came into my family just as much as I came into his. And daughters should be cherished, we are great.", "What my parents want from me is me to convince Diana to speak to them, which unfortunately would be easy because she's too nice. I've given her a heads up and she's taking the necessary precautions. My grandmother is well aware of the harassment I'm facing, she wants me to be 'better than them' smh. I'd rather live at least 5 hours away from my parents before I told them I was bisexual just to avoid an escalation of a situation like this. They have very close gay friends so I don't think they're homophobic, but they're pretty big on the 'family name' and continuing the 'lineage' so idk how they'll react when they find out their eldest son likes men lmfao", ">Sweetie, where do you think your parents got their psycho mentalities from? Their own parents. \n\nI'm not even joking when I say they didn't. My parents' siblings on both sides are all great people. They went weird during their TTC journey and haven't fully recovered.", "They hated my sister for being a massive feminist and they even tried to stop her from going to college which is something I don't understand as they claimed they wanted her to be 'strong and independent'. They see her becoming a mother, esp at a young age as her accepting 'her role' in their stupid world view so that's why they wanna know my niece.", "Very NTA here. And honestly it\u2019s probably more about image. She isn\u2019t under their thumb anymore and it\u2019s harder to control the narrative. Now that she has a baby they desperately want to be a part of it just for the image of being grandparents. There\u2019s no love here. Definitely get the RO.", "I was doing the best I could at the time. I'm back in my home state now but when she moved out I lived 10 hours away and it wasn't possible for her to move in with me because she stayed in-state for college. I was obviously concerned because of the age gap so I spoke to her, made sure she was safe and I speak to her daily now, and see her atleast twice a week. Her boyfriend is also a good person. Age gaps can be a red flag but not always. My own partner is 5 years older than me and I've been nothing but safe with him", "Exactly, and his parents were so happy that they're 25 year old son was dating a 18 year old like what?", "The misogynistic \"girls just leave\" doesn't just show up. Maybe your parents siblings just didn't drink the Kool aid. Personally I'd start scrubbing my memory for any points where grandma favored her grandsons to see if this is a pattern. Nonetheless, your grandmother is wrong. You are not denying your parents access to their children. Children don't owe their parents access to their lives, especially when it sounds like they bullied and neglected your sister her whole life. If \"but we're faaaamily\" mattered, it should have mattered when she was a child too.", "All the more reason to protect her and your niece firm their terrible behaviors and company.\nNTA", "Yeah, I wasn't blaming you. You're only a few years older than her, and had the same shit parents.\n\nBut you have to understand that she had no support system other than the family of the adult who knocked up a teenager, and that's dangerous. \n\nDangerous doesn't always mean disaster, and hopefully for her sake it doesn't, but people are gonna side eye this.", "Especially considering she came from a very abusive household"]}
