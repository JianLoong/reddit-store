Family and friends are confused and strangers ask us if we're twins. \n\nI expressed several times that this makes me uncomfortable, both to her and to my parents. I don't wear the clothes she has anymore, but she will just buy whatever new clothes I buy. I don't post much on social media anymore, but she still knows what I do. \n\nAt the start I was worried about her mental health, I tried to get her to talk to me, but she claims she's fine. My parents refuse to do anything because 'it's harmless'. \n\nSo I posted on social media that I was getting a pixie cut (very short hair). I didn't. She did. She's very angry and says that I manipulated her into doing this (I just posted about me doing it, didn't mention her at all). My parents are upset. Though I don't want to upset anyone, I'm glad I look like a separate person again. \n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR: sister copies everything, made her think I was cutting my hair, didn't.

It plays a role in comprehending behavior and forming strong connections in our relationships.\n\nMirroring can have a negative aspect, especially in individuals with narcissistic tendencies. They may exploit it for manipulation, eroding trust and causing emotional harm within relationships\nActive listening, matching energy, body language alignment, speech pattern adaptation, emotional validation, and nonverbal clues are all part of mirroring strategies. These strategies efficiently improve communication and help people connect.\u201d\n\n- https://healthnews.com/mental-health/self-care-and-therapy/mirroring-psychology-its-effect-on-relationships/#\n\nSo according to this article everyone copy\u2019s people they look up to or adore, it just seems your sister is doing it to a very extreme and unhealthy degree.

Eventually she will grow up and go omg why did I copy everything she did yuck.... eventually. \n\nIf she wants to cry about it then you just laugh and say oh well I told you to stop copying me didn't I? She did this to herself and she copped the perfect consequence for her annoyance!\n\nA lot of people are being super dramatic omg she needs therapy.
