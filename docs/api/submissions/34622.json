Family and friends are confused and strangers ask us if we're twins. \n\nI expressed several times that this makes me uncomfortable, both to her and to my parents. I don't wear the clothes she has anymore, but she will just buy whatever new clothes I buy. I don't post much on social media anymore, but she still knows what I do. \n\nAt the start I was worried about her mental health, I tried to get her to talk to me, but she claims she's fine. My parents refuse to do anything because 'it's harmless'. \n\nSo I posted on social media that I was getting a pixie cut (very short hair). I didn't. She did. She's very angry and says that I manipulated her into doing this (I just posted about me doing it, didn't mention her at all). My parents are upset. Though I don't want to upset anyone, I'm glad I look like a separate person again. \n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR: sister copies everything, made her think I was cutting my hair, didn't.

It plays a role in comprehending behavior and forming strong connections in our relationships.\n\nMirroring can have a negative aspect, especially in individuals with narcissistic tendencies. They may exploit it for manipulation, eroding trust and causing emotional harm within relationships\nActive listening, matching energy, body language alignment, speech pattern adaptation, emotional validation, and nonverbal clues are all part of mirroring strategies. These strategies efficiently improve communication and help people connect.\u201d\n\n- https://healthnews.com/mental-health/self-care-and-therapy/mirroring-psychology-its-effect-on-relationships/#\n\nSo according to this article everyone copy\u2019s people they look up to or adore, it just seems your sister is doing it to a very extreme and unhealthy degree.

Her absolutely disproportionate reaction when getting a haircut and no longer being almost identical to OP proves this. It speaks to someone who is incredibly insecure in their own self and possibly doesn't feel like they have an identity of their own. Things like this shouldn't bother a normal person who has a healthy relationship with their own body and their own identity.\n\nIf \"heaps\" of kids go through something to this extreme extent I think we'd be seeing it.

Can she do that?", "Im female. When i get my hair cut i get it so it's just below the ears to easily be out of my way and it doesn't look too bad when it grows out. I just want my hair nice and unproblematic.

If it grows out, it's still a bob that can be tucked behind my ears", "Yeah I think you're on to something. *Long* hair, I still had to tie up and away. When it was mid-length it was easier to just leave down without looking terrible. Long hair didn't suit me, but a man-bun did. That's mostly why I decided to cut it, was tired of the headaches."]}
