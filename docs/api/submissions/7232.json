Haileys mother left when she was around 1 and my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father. \n\nWhen Hailey was 6 months old her mom was dealing with some mental health issues so my boyfriend hired a nanny, Laura, to do everything baby related. He had Laura move in within a couple months of Halley\u2019s mom leaving and Laura is still working for my boyfriend today. \n\nLaura is very close with my boyfriend\u2019s family. She\u2019s with the family every holiday and honestly I think they like her better than me. My boyfriend says she\u2019s become a good friend over the years and he and Laura go out at least once a month. And Laura is extremely involved in Hailey\u2019s life. She\u2019s room mom at her school (I didn\u2019t know you could be room mom without being a mom), she\u2019s at every play, concert, soccer game, etc., she even goes to Hailey\u2019s therapy appointments. Hailey doesn\u2019t do anything for herself because of Laura. Laura wakes her up, packs her backpack and lunch and does her hair every morning and does homework with her every afternoon. She tucks Hailey in every night and sits with her until she falls asleep. \n\nHailey is very attached to Laura and Laura is to Hailey. Laura even takes Hailey out with her on her days off. Hailey has been disinterested in getting closer with me and her dad and I honestly think it\u2019s because of Laura. \n\nI was talking to my boyfriend and said that Hailey\u2019s too attached to Laura and suggested that he be more involved in Hailey\u2019s life since he\u2019s now in a better position to be a father and we can have Laura move out. \n\nHailey heard us and is heartbroken and terrified. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me or leave Laura\u2019s side. She\u2019s faked being sick at school so many times this week that they don\u2019t want her to come back today. Laura says Hailey hasn\u2019t been sleeping and is worried about her. \n\nMy boyfriend is blaming me for all of this but there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve known that Hailey would be eavesdropping or that she\u2019d get this scared.

Like, asshole of the month so far.", "YTA. Massively so. You enter Hailey's life, and the first thing you do is destroy the one constant in her life? The one thing that has been consistent, and she could always count on. Hailey needs a lot of therapy, and a lot less of you!", "Clearly the nanny is the girl's surrogate mom.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest getting out of the relatuonship.  You're tying to compete with the nanny and it will not end well for you or your bf or his daughter.\n\nYTA", "YTA it sounds like that's the only \"mother\" figure this little girl have ever known, what is wrong with you.", "You're not interested in having Laura move out for Hailey's benefit. You want Laura to move out because you're jealous that there's another woman who's so close to your boyfriend. So you want the mother figure that Hailey has known her entire life to abandon her right at the precipice of puberty. What is wrong with you? \n\nIn case it's not obvious, YTA.", "Cool so you admit that he's a terrible and uninvolved father and this adult is pretty much the only one in this kids life actually acting like a parent to her and you want to take that away from her? BEFORE she's gotten close to any other adults? You think, for some reason, that will HELP her become close to her uninvolved dad who sent away the one adult who cared about her? It didn't occur to you beforehand that it might make her heartbroken and terrified?\n\nYeah YTA and your bf is right to blame you. Although he's also an asshole too for not having a better relationship with his kid in the first place.", "YTA to an extent that I almost believe this is a movie plot rather than a real story.  For all intents and purposes, Laura has served as Hailey's mom in every respect.  Hailey's choices were:\n\n1. Accept her nanny as her mom\n2. Have no mom at all\n\nYou, a complete stranger, want to deprive Haily of the only mom she's ever known just to satisfy your fragile ego.  How are you expecting that this is going to go?  You're not even the kid's stepmom yet, even though you're describing yourself as one, and you're already behaving like the wicked stepmother out of a live action Disney movie.  Before accepting your BF's proposal (if one ever happens), you need to decide whether you're prepared to accept a co-parenting situation involving the bio-mom as well as the nanny.  If your delicate ego can't handle that, then do everyone a favor and just end the relationship now.", "info: how long y'all have been together. \n\nbut with the info I currently have,\n\nYES, YTA. Technically the dad ITA too, he wasn't that involved in his daughter's life.\n\n  \nIf you think about it, Laura has been with Hailey like a MOTHER, and you can clearly see here that Hailey sees her as a mother figure, so it will obviously be hard for her because that woman took care of her as a baby, watched every school play, Was also at therapy appointments, basically Hailey's mom. \n\nIt looks like ur just jealous that Laura is more closer to ur bf's family than you, and that they like her more than you. I think first off, you should just stop being selfish.\n\nWhy would you want to separate those two?\n\nIf you want to get closer to Hailey, you shouldn't take things from her, and you should actually be present for her, help her, and just be there for her. Taking away Laura from her will make her resent you even more.", "Of course YTA\n\n\"my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father.\"\n\nStarting off with excuses.

Ofcourse she is like  a parent to the kid. Removing her will be traumatising for the girl.", "Yes, absolutely YTA. Green is a terrible color on you. Stop thinking of yourself for a minute and consider the CHILD who lost her mother. \n\nLaura and Hailey have a loving and secure bond according to your own recounting. You are trying to sabotage their relationship. Why? Is Hailey suffering? Does she have behavioral issues that isolate her from her peers? Does Hailey display obsessive, insecure behavior in Laura's absence? Is Hailey showing signs of guilt or depression? No.\n\nYou want to break their bond so that their is no \"other woman\" in your boyfriend's house. That is just sick. She is a surrogate maternal pillar in Hailey's life. Both Laura and Hailey have earned the sanctuary of their bond. Stop trying to poison their happiness with your pathological insecurity.", "Yes yta, obviously this is the only parental relationship the child has. You're a girlfriend, this is not your child, you're not paying for the nanny, you have no say here. \n\nAnd why in the world are you even interested in a relationship with someone who has no involvement with their own child? When you need to prompt your bf to pay attention to his own child..... wow. \n\nAt least he's arranged the nanny. Leave it alone.", "Well let's see... bio mom left when Hailey was an infant, and dad wasn't much in the picture either according to you so... It's pretty freaking natural that Hailey would develop very strong attachment bonds  to the only person  who has been taking care of her since she was a baby and for all practical purposes is functioning as her mom.\n\nI don't know how new to the scene you are as the gf but... it sounds like having her around and doing all these things for Hailey leaves you feeling a bit insecure about your own position in the family dynamic, maybe wondering where you fit, which is totally understandable.\n\nWhat's not understandable is why you would think the best idea is to essentially punish Hailey by removing her main caretaker and someone she obviously loves just because you're insecure.\n\nThat's not fair to Laura *or* Hailey.\n\nIt's clear from Hailey's reaction to the mere idea of losing Laura that there are perhaps some unhealthy levels of attachment, however I'm not certain it's your place to deal with that, and certainly not by just severing that connection immediately. The emotional damage that could do to Hailey is huge, and I guarantee she'd never trust you again. If you plan on becoming a part of this family then there need to be some open-minded conversations about what you all think the family dynamic should look like, and I would recommend some therapy for the whole family and particularly Hailey.\n\nAnxious-attachment at such a young age is a tricky thing, but the way you are dealing with it is not good.\n\nYTA", "YTA. No offense but your the girlfriend with no permanent ties to this family. Laura has been with Hailey since she was a baby and is literally the girl\u2019s mother. If you are not comfortable with the situation then you should leave. If not then get on board and be more supportive!", "This woman has filled in as her mother her entire life, nearly a decade. Nanny, in turn, is clearly dedicated to this child.", "You\u2019re not even her step mother, your her father\u2019s gf.", "You and your boyfriend are TA. By your own admission he's an uninvolved father who employed a nanny for the better part of ten years. At this point Laura is not a nanny to Hailey, she is family. Why would you deprive an 11-year old child of the one person who's taken an authentic interest in her life? Are you going to step up and assume the responsibilities of the maternal figure you're trying to get rid of?\n\n>*Laura is very close with my boyfriend\u2019s family. She\u2019s with the family every holiday and honestly I think they like her better than me*\n\nIt sounds like you're jealous of Laura.

And how long since have you've known the daughter in person? Do you live together and for how long have you?", "Absolutely YTA.\n\nYou're jealous and insecure.

Mind your own business.", "YTA\n\nEven if you have been together for a long time, the way you've written this sounds like it's based out of jealousy more than it is care for Hailey.\n\nLaura is the only steady adult figure that she knows, and so when and if Laura leaves / helps Hailey gain independence this needs to be a carefully planned situation all three adults are a part of. Laura slowly doing less for Hailey, Hailey slowly spending more time with you & her so far pretty absent Dad.\n\nRipping Laura out of Hailey's life is going to do more harm than good.", "YTA for essentially wanting to rip away this girl from the only mother she's ever known.", "Yta\n\nTearing a child away from her one comfort and constant in her life because you\u2019re jealous is a disgraceful thing to do. Laura is no longer just a nanny, she is a parental figure in Hailey\u2019s life. Sending her away will absolutely cement Hailey\u2019s hatred of you.", "YTA.\n\nyour stepdaughter and her nanny have formed a bond through circumstance. There is nothing you can \"do\" about that. That fact that you want to can make your intentions seem quite questionable.\n\nWhile you do share concerns for the fact that Hailey is reaching young adulthood and doesn't do anything for herself, or that this would be a good time for the father to start forming a bond and start parenting- those factoids came SECONDARY. Your first point, and apparent main concern being: your boyfriend's (and his family's) perception of Laura vs. you.\n\nis this *TRULY* about Hailey's and your bf's best interests, or is this about you?", "This sounds like a classic evil stepmother tale. \n\nYou\u2019re scheming to take away Hailey\u2019s mother figure.

Your boyfriend should dump you and get with her", "YTA. It doesn't matter how long you have been dating.  Very Clearly she is seen as a mother to the little girl. The woman also brought her up,  you don't think that turns into feelings of motherhood? You cannot separate these two. It's not atypical babysitter deal- it's like a full time mother deal.", "YTA\n\nThe jealousy is just dripping off this story. \n\nI get that you care about your bf, and would like a close relationship with his daughter, but you CANNOT try to take away the only mother figure she knows. Title of \u2018nanny\u2019 aside, Laura is her mother figure. She is her primary caregiver. \n\nYou cannot replace Laura. \n\nWhat you could do is put in some effort to help Laura and be involved in events in your own way. You\u2019ll need to build your own relationship with Hailey that will be different and separate from what she has with Laura. But you can\u2019t just cut Laura off and try to say \u2018I\u2019m the only woman you need in your life now\u2019. \n\nYou trying to get rid of Laura is going to blow up in your face. She is a member of their family, and if your hope is to eventually be part of the family, you need to accept her and be thankful Hailey has someone so loving to care for her.", "YTA\n\nYou obviously know nothing about children in general, and Hailey specifically, if you would suggest that her mother figure (because that\u2019s what Laura is) up and move out.  I get why your bf\u2019s family likes Laura better than they like you.\n\nLaura and Hailey genuinely love each other.  If you\u2019re serious about being with your bf, you need to work with that, rather than against it.", "YTA. Prioritizing what you want over what\u2019s in your potential stepchild\u2019s best interest is immature and selfish at best. \n\nIf you believe that banishing her only mother figure from her life will make Hailey like you more, you\u2019re sadly mistaken. I\u2019m genuinely stunned that anyone would be so incredibly self-centered. You\u2019re treating Hailey like a puppy instead of a human being - taking away her mother won\u2019t make her bond with you instead. \n\nIf you want to be a parent to Hailey, put her needs first.

It\u2019s also wonderful to seek out more opportunities to get to know daughter. But it *is* a scary thought for her to hear you want her \u201cmom figure\u201d to leave. Maybe you can change the boundaries and arrangement years from now; lord knows their relationship *should* change as she grows up. It will have to by necessity. But this is not the way to start, and not this way. \n\nThis is a concern for Hailey and dad, and probably a family therapist. Not you.", "Check your insecurity.

I can't believe you have the nerve to request that her nanny whom she obviously loves move out because.... stepdaughter isn't interested in getting closer to you???? And you're not even married. Yes, your bf should be more involved and interested in his daughter but she has someone in her life that has taken on a parental role and you're threatening to take that away. Of course, Hailey is petrified. I hope your bf realizes that you're not stepmom material and takes that into consideration", "YTA. You actually think Hailey would like you better if you made her nanny move out? This is the beginning of growing resentment and I'd be surprised if you and your boyfriend last.

I still resent the whole dynamic. \n\nA child can have multiple relationships. A child chooses which ones are most important.

This child has been neglected by one parent and abandoned by the other. Thank god Laura had stepped up where your boyfriend failed time and time again. Laura is a saint and no shit his family likes her more than you. You literally are putting your jealousy above the welfare of a child. \n\nPlease break up with this man and leave this child alone.

Rather than removing Laura, why doesn\u2019t your boyfriend step up? Be more involved. You too. Hailey can have multiple adults love and support her.", "ESH except for Laura and Hailey.  I say that because of this: \n\n>Haileys mother left when she was around 1 and my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father.\n\nBy OP's own admission, Hailey's father lives with them but is uninvolved and basically had his own child raised by a nanny--understandable when her mother first left as I'm sure he was overwhelmed, but she is *11*. Meanwhile, OP wants to get rid of the only caretaker hasn't abandoned or neglected Hailey.", "With too little context it is hard to judge. Anyways moving out a person that Hailey has seen as a mother figure for years is a bad idea.\n\nEspecially if you are close enough with Hailey, she would have not freaked out about the idea of Laura moving out.\n\nShe's a kid. Give her some time. Show her that you could be a mom to her and she could be safe with you. Once she gets comfortable with you, don't completely stop her from seeing Laura.

Haileys mother left when she was around 1 and my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father. \n\nWhen Hailey was 6 months old her mom was dealing with some mental health issues so my boyfriend hired a nanny, Laura, to do everything baby related. He had Laura move in within a couple months of Halley\u2019s mom leaving and Laura is still working for my boyfriend today. \n\nLaura is very close with my boyfriend\u2019s family. She\u2019s with the family every holiday and honestly I think they like her better than me. My boyfriend says she\u2019s become a good friend over the years and he and Laura go out at least once a month. And Laura is extremely involved in Hailey\u2019s life. She\u2019s room mom at her school (I didn\u2019t know you could be room mom without being a mom), she\u2019s at every play, concert, soccer game, etc., she even goes to Hailey\u2019s therapy appointments. Hailey doesn\u2019t do anything for herself because of Laura. Laura wakes her up, packs her backpack and lunch and does her hair every morning and does homework with her every afternoon. She tucks Hailey in every night and sits with her until she falls asleep. \n\nHailey is very attached to Laura and Laura is to Hailey. Laura even takes Hailey out with her on her days off. Hailey has been disinterested in getting closer with me and her dad and I honestly think it\u2019s because of Laura. \n\nI was talking to my boyfriend and said that Hailey\u2019s too attached to Laura and suggested that he be more involved in Hailey\u2019s life since he\u2019s now in a better position to be a father and we can have Laura move out. \n\nHailey heard us and is heartbroken and terrified. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me or leave Laura\u2019s side. She\u2019s faked being sick at school so many times this week that they don\u2019t want her to come back today. Laura says Hailey hasn\u2019t been sleeping and is worried about her. \n\nMy boyfriend is blaming me for all of this but there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve known that Hailey would be eavesdropping or that she\u2019d get this scared.

A child at age 11 should be developing some sense of autonomy, making friends, doing her own hair, etc., and based on your post, that isn't happening here.\n\nYou state that Laura goes to therapy with Hailey. Is she merely providing transportation or does she sit in the therapist's office while Hailey gets therapy?

The woman, the true mother, said \u201cno you can\u2019t cut him in half he will die!

The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.\u201d\n\nBut the first one insisted, \u201cNo!

Your son is dead and mine is alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n24 Then the king said, \u201cBring me a sword.\u201d So they brought a sword for the king. 25 He then gave an order: \u201cCut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.\u201d\n\n26 The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, \u201cPlease, my lord, give her the living baby! Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d\n\nBut the other said, \u201cNeither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!\u201d\n\n27 Then the king gave his ruling: \u201cGive the living baby to the first woman.

Maybe Hailey has issues that make it hard for her to sleep. Also, a therapist wouldn\u2019t allow Laura or any other parental figure to sit in on the sessions so there isn\u2019t anything inappropriate there either.  All of the things that Laura does for this child are things that the average parent does. By OP\u2019s admission, her bf isn\u2019t an involved parent. Someone needs to step up and do these things.", "Took far too long to find this comment.\n\nLaura is an employee. What happens if she decides to leave for another job? That would traumatize Hailey right? Well whether of Laura\u2019s own volition or as a parental decision, one way or another there is likely a lot of trauma ahead for Hailey. It definitely seems like an unhealthy attachment.\n\nIt should also be noted that OP does NOT seem to be acting purely out of jealousy, but rather due to recognizing the unhealthy nature of this relationship AND pushing for the father to be more personally involved in raising his daughter.\n\nI think the main reason OP is also an asshole is because she didn\u2019t have the tact to have that conversation out of ear shot from Hailey.", "You're taking the word of a person who admited to be jelous, so I would say you take that into consideration, and also this girl must have serious abandonment issues and Laura is her safe person, the only reliable parental figure she has known, I think is very normal in that context for her to be so attached to Laura.\nOP's only interest is her self, she didn't stop to think about the child one single minute all her post is about how Laura makes her feel insecure, and I'm sure that's why everyone is saying YTA, because frankly she couldn't be more even if she tried. But yeah, father of the year should be more involved in his daugther's life, he's the main factor on the whole situation.", "By E-S-H I sincerely hope you don't mean the nanny or the innocent child.", "OP is getting too comfortable.

How selfish, self-centered, and narcissistic. Gross.", "That's what got me. Like... duh! What did OP expect?!

Her choice of words definitely could have been better and it sucks the child overheard what she said, but she's  not TA for what she did and why she did it. She's T A for how she worded it.", "The child's therapist should be working to help Hailey work through her trauma to eventually become a functioning, independent human being. The level of coddling Hailey is receiving from Laura will prevent her from acquiring and maintaining healthy relationships in the future. Per OP, the child does not do anything without Laura. Not healthy. I stand by my verdict.", "Based on the level of care that Laura is providing, she\u2019s probably a professional nanny. Many professions nannies stay with a family for a long time so it\u2019s unlikely that Laura will be moving on anytime soon.  OP isn\u2019t even Hailey\u2019s stepmother so it\u2019s not her place to weigh in on this.", "She was also unaware that Hailey was eavesdropping. I think that's a huge factor here. Everyone seems fixated on Laura playing good mom and the gf becoming an evil stepmom. They're ignoring the fact that Laura's relationship with Hailey is stunting Hailey's emotional development. OP's lack of tact is the only reason I didn't judge N T A.", "I don't mean the nanny or the child. I just think it isn't OP's place to make that kind of a decision. Right or wrong what is going on, it isn't his place. My feeling is he should walk away. because I think it has the potential to be a trainwreck", "I just reread it and literally cannot find where it speaks to what \"he\" does?  It says Laura does a lot of stuff, but does not mention anything about what the boyfriend does.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions so far in this story is.\n\n1. Hired Laura.\n2. Asked her to move in, and takes her out to once a month (honestly probably the reason of the jealousy).\n3. Was part of conversation which OP initiated about Laura. (don't know how you control this).\n4. Blamed OP for the issues. (which seems legimitate).\n\nI see a boyfriend who found a nanny he finds really good at her job, and is treating her well as part of the family (and which the family treats as part of the family).  Also seems one who has set clear boundaries given he is still dating.  If you are hiring a nanny, literally what has he done wrong?  I guess aside from dating the (everyone in agreement horrible) OP?\n\nDoes dating a bad person automatically make you a bad person?  Given the stories we see here all the time, I would say no.  \"Not involved in his child's life\" is not actually listed.  The (again villain here) says \"better position to be a father\", do you really trust the OP's judgment on his capabilities as a father?  Why?", "Agree. He should run far away now.", "She won't definitely be engaged now!", "Oh, yeah! That did come across as insanely snarky!!!", "Therapists usually suggest coping strategies until the problem is completely resolved. Stop implying that the love that Laura is giving Hailey is some sort of crutch. When I was growing up, my mom was very hands on and people would tell her that if she didn\u2019t stop I would never be independent. Now that I\u2019m an adult, my mom is the only one of her friends whose child is fully independent. All of her critics have adult kids living with them, taking money from them and they\u2019re raising their grandkids too. Love isn\u2019t a crutch.", "Good point, yeah overall they definitely shouldn\u2019t just rip Laura out of Hailey\u2019s life right away. But they need to start taking steps to have Hailey be less dependent on Laura, and have the father be more involved. They may need professional help and therapy to guide them.\n\nBut simply burying their heads in the sand and letting the attachment continue to grow would not be wise IMO. So many of the comments are acting like \u201cLaura is pretty much the mom, just let them be you evil stepwitch!\u201d and I just can\u2019t agree with that", "The only info we have on him is not involved in his childs life, dating a disney villain and they discussed sending away her only care giver.", "Your experience and those of your critics is anecdotal and cannot be generalized to the population as a whole. \n\nIt is also of some important to note, as another respondent did, that Laura is an employee. She is not the child's mother and has not set an appropriate boundary for the child should she choose to work elsewhere or be in any other position where she can no longer work for the family.", "Laura is most likely a professional nanny so she\u2019ll most likely stay with the family for a long time.  Also many kids stay in touch with their nannies after they move on to other jobs so even if Laura quits tomorrow, it\u2019s very possible for Hailey to have a relationship with her. OP isn\u2019t even married or engaged to Hailey\u2019s father so she really shouldn\u2019t be weighing in on this. This child has no one and you would rather her be completely neglected instead of having her needs met by an adult who is available to do it. That\u2019s a cruel stance to take.", "I cannot continue a discussion where so many opinions are postulated based on assumption, falsity, and/or no evidence.\n\n1. We don't know if she's a professional nanny.\n\n2. We don't know if Laura would continue the relationship if her employment were terminated.\n\n3. You postulate that Hailey has no one, yet OP states Laura is close with the bf's family.\n\n4. Nowhere have I stated that I would choose that the child be completely neglected.\n\n5. I cannot be convicted of being cruel when nothing in my responses indicate that I am suggesting the child be neglected.\n\nStop manipulating my words to suit your agenda. It's unacceptable and intolerable.", "I\u2019m not manipulating your words. I\u2019m looking at what you\u2019re saying and responding accordingly. Just to show you that I\u2019m fair I\u2019ll respond to each of your claims in the same format and order that you posted them. \n\n1.  I\u2019m basing my assumption that Laura is a professional nanny based on the level of care she is providing and how long she has been with the family. Long term, live in nannies are usually professionals.\n2. Laura has developed a friendship with OP\u2019s bf and his family so she has become more than an employee. She more like a family friend at this point. Friendships like that don\u2019t usually end because the employment relationship ended. \n3. If OP\u2019s bf\u2019s family intended to be the primary caregivers for Hailey, they would be doing it already. She\u2019s 11 years old. When I say that Hailey has no one, I mean as far as caregivers are concerned. \n4. You read that OP\u2019s bf isn\u2019t an involved father and you\u2019re suggesting that something be done about the relationship between Laura and Hailey. If Laura doesn\u2019t take care of this child, who will? You are inadvertently suggesting that it\u2019s better for this child to be neglected because Hailey is an employee and not a relative. \n5. Most people would see the situation that Hailey is in and be glad that someone is there for her. Instead you are implying that the relationship is inappropriate. If you don\u2019t want this child to be neglected, what do you want? Because that\u2019s the only alternative here."]}
