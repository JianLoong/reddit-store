Haileys mother left when she was around 1 and my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father. \n\nWhen Hailey was 6 months old her mom was dealing with some mental health issues so my boyfriend hired a nanny, Laura, to do everything baby related. He had Laura move in within a couple months of Halley\u2019s mom leaving and Laura is still working for my boyfriend today. \n\nLaura is very close with my boyfriend\u2019s family. She\u2019s with the family every holiday and honestly I think they like her better than me. My boyfriend says she\u2019s become a good friend over the years and he and Laura go out at least once a month. And Laura is extremely involved in Hailey\u2019s life. She\u2019s room mom at her school (I didn\u2019t know you could be room mom without being a mom), she\u2019s at every play, concert, soccer game, etc., she even goes to Hailey\u2019s therapy appointments. Hailey doesn\u2019t do anything for herself because of Laura. Laura wakes her up, packs her backpack and lunch and does her hair every morning and does homework with her every afternoon. She tucks Hailey in every night and sits with her until she falls asleep. \n\nHailey is very attached to Laura and Laura is to Hailey. Laura even takes Hailey out with her on her days off. Hailey has been disinterested in getting closer with me and her dad and I honestly think it\u2019s because of Laura. \n\nI was talking to my boyfriend and said that Hailey\u2019s too attached to Laura and suggested that he be more involved in Hailey\u2019s life since he\u2019s now in a better position to be a father and we can have Laura move out. \n\nHailey heard us and is heartbroken and terrified. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me or leave Laura\u2019s side. She\u2019s faked being sick at school so many times this week that they don\u2019t want her to come back today. Laura says Hailey hasn\u2019t been sleeping and is worried about her. \n\nMy boyfriend is blaming me for all of this but there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve known that Hailey would be eavesdropping or that she\u2019d get this scared. Am I the asshole here?\n\nUpdate: Laura left with Hailey today. Apparently Hailey\u2019s mental state has only gotten worse and she\u2019s hoping that getting Hailey away from \u201ctriggers\u201d (me) and an intensive therapy program will prevent her from being hospitalized. Hailey also left me a card saying that she hates me and wants me to leave.", "created_utc": 1673625974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ay69g/aita_for_saying_my_stepdaughter_is_too_close_to/", "score": 5630, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, asshole of the month so far.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards!", "YTA. Massively so. You enter Hailey's life, and the first thing you do is destroy the one constant in her life? The one thing that has been consistent, and she could always count on. Hailey needs a lot of therapy, and a lot less of you!", "Clearly the nanny is the girl's surrogate mom.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest getting out of the relationship.  You're trying to compete with the nanny and it will not end well for you or your bf or his daughter.\n\nYTA", "YTA it sounds like that's the only \"mother\" figure this little girl have ever known, what is wrong with you.", "You're not interested in having Laura move out for Hailey's benefit. You want Laura to move out because you're jealous that there's another woman who's so close to your boyfriend. So you want the mother figure that Hailey has known her entire life to abandon her right at the precipice of puberty. What is wrong with you? \n\nIn case it's not obvious, YTA.", "Cool so you admit that he's a terrible and uninvolved father and this adult is pretty much the only one in this kids life actually acting like a parent to her and you want to take that away from her? BEFORE she's gotten close to any other adults? You think, for some reason, that will HELP her become close to her uninvolved dad who sent away the one adult who cared about her? It didn't occur to you beforehand that it might make her heartbroken and terrified?\n\nYeah YTA and your bf is right to blame you. Although he's also an asshole too for not having a better relationship with his kid in the first place.", "YTA to an extent that I almost believe this is a movie plot rather than a real story.  For all intents and purposes, Laura has served as Hailey's mom in every respect.  Hailey's choices were:\n\n1. Accept her nanny as her mom\n2. Have no mom at all\n\nYou, a complete stranger, want to deprive Haily of the only mom she's ever known just to satisfy your fragile ego.  How are you expecting that this is going to go?  You're not even the kid's stepmom yet, even though you're describing yourself as one, and you're already behaving like the wicked stepmother out of a live action Disney movie.  Before accepting your BF's proposal (if one ever happens), you need to decide whether you're prepared to accept a co-parenting situation involving the bio-mom as well as the nanny.  If your delicate ego can't handle that, then do everyone a favor and just end the relationship now.", "info: how long y'all have been together. \n\nbut with the info I currently have,\n\nYES, YTA. Technically the dad ITA too, he wasn't that involved in his daughter's life.\n\n  \nIf you think about it, Laura has been with Hailey like a MOTHER, and you can clearly see here that Hailey sees her as a mother figure, so it will obviously be hard for her because that woman took care of her as a baby, watched every school play, Was also at therapy appointments, basically Hailey's mom. \n\nIt looks like ur just jealous that Laura is more closer to ur bf's family than you, and that they like her more than you. I think first off, you should just stop being selfish.\n\nWhy would you want to separate those two?\n\nIf you want to get closer to Hailey, you shouldn't take things from her, and you should actually be present for her, help her, and just be there for her. Taking away Laura from her will make her resent you even more.", "Of course YTA\n\n\"my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father.\"\n\nStarting off with excuses.

Oh wait....\n\n\"My boyfriend is blaming me for all of this \"\n\nNot entirely your fault but I do see his point", "I'm not sure why you are so determined to separate a child from their primary caregiver, but it indicates that you are the problem.\n\nA child cannot be \"too close\" to the person that has raised them.\n\nNow that you have voiced your opinions, there is very little chance that the child will ever trust you or want you as a mother figure.\n\nYTA", "YTA the Nanny has done for the last 11 year everything a mother and a father would have done. Ofcourse she is like  a parent to the kid. Removing her will be traumatising for the girl.", "Yes, absolutely YTA. Green is a terrible color on you. Stop thinking of yourself for a minute and consider the CHILD who lost her mother. \n\nLaura and Hailey have a loving and secure bond according to your own recounting. You are trying to sabotage their relationship. Why? Is Hailey suffering? Does she have behavioral issues that isolate her from her peers? Does Hailey display obsessive, insecure behavior in Laura's absence? Is Hailey showing signs of guilt or depression? No.\n\nYou want to break their bond so that there is no \"other woman\" in your boyfriend's house. That is just sick. She is a surrogate maternal pillar in Hailey's life. Both Laura and Hailey have earned the sanctuary of their bond. Stop trying to poison their happiness with your pathological insecurity.", "Yes yta, obviously this is the only parental relationship the child has. You're a girlfriend, this is not your child, you're not paying for the nanny, you have no say here. \n\nAnd why in the world are you even interested in a relationship with someone who has no involvement with their own child? When you need to prompt your bf to pay attention to his own child..... wow. \n\nAt least he's arranged the nanny. Leave it alone.", "Well let's see... bio mom left when Hailey was an infant, and dad wasn't much in the picture either according to you so... It's pretty freaking natural that Hailey would develop very strong attachment bonds  to the only person  who has been taking care of her since she was a baby and for all practical purposes is functioning as her mom.\n\nI don't know how new to the scene you are as the gf but... it sounds like having her around and doing all these things for Hailey leaves you feeling a bit insecure about your own position in the family dynamic, maybe wondering where you fit, which is totally understandable.\n\nWhat's not understandable is why you would think the best idea is to essentially punish Hailey by removing her main caretaker and someone she obviously loves just because you're insecure.\n\nThat's not fair to Laura *or* Hailey.\n\nIt's clear from Hailey's reaction to the mere idea of losing Laura that they have a very strong bond, and that Hailey is very attached, she's only 11 after all!  The emotional damage that could result at having that bond just stripped away from her is huge, and I guarantee she'd never trust you again. If you plan on becoming a part of this family then there need to be some open-minded conversations about what you all think the family dynamic should look like, and I would recommend some therapy for the whole family and particularly Hailey.\n\nAnxious-attachment at such a young age is a tricky thing, but the way you are dealing with it is not good.\n\nYTA", "YTA. No offense but your the girlfriend with no permanent ties to this family. Laura has been with Hailey since she was a baby and is literally the girl\u2019s mother. If you are not comfortable with the situation then you should leave. If not then get on board and be more supportive!", "This woman has filled in as her mother her entire life, nearly a decade. Nanny, in turn, is clearly dedicated to this child.", "You\u2019re not even her step mother, your her father\u2019s gf.", "You and your boyfriend are TA. By your own admission he's an uninvolved father who employed a nanny for the better part of ten years. At this point Laura is not a nanny to Hailey, she is family. Why would you deprive an 11-year old child of the one person who's taken an authentic interest in her life? Are you going to step up and assume the responsibilities of the maternal figure you're trying to get rid of?\n\n>*Laura is very close with my boyfriend\u2019s family. She\u2019s with the family every holiday and honestly I think they like her better than me*\n\nIt sounds like you're jealous of Laura.

And how long since have you've known the daughter in person? Do you live together and for how long have you?", "Absolutely YTA.\n\nYou're jealous and insecure. It's not your kid, and it's not your decision to make. Mind your own business.", "YTA\n\nEven if you have been together for a long time, the way you've written this sounds like it's based out of jealousy more than it is care for Hailey.\n\nLaura is the only steady adult figure that she knows, and so when and if Laura leaves / helps Hailey gain independence this needs to be a carefully planned situation all three adults are a part of. Laura slowly doing less for Hailey, Hailey slowly spending more time with you & her so far pretty absent Dad.\n\nRipping Laura out of Hailey's life is going to do more harm than good.", "YTA for essentially wanting to rip away this girl from the only mother she's ever known.", "Yta\n\nTearing a child away from her one comfort and constant in her life because you\u2019re jealous is a disgraceful thing to do. Laura is no longer just a nanny, she is a parental figure in Hailey\u2019s life. Sending her away will absolutely cement Hailey\u2019s hatred of you.", "YTA.\n\nyour stepdaughter and her nanny have formed a bond through circumstance. There is nothing you can \"do\" about that. That fact that you want to can make your intentions seem quite questionable.\n\nWhile you do share concerns for the fact that Hailey is reaching young adulthood and doesn't do anything for herself, or that this would be a good time for the father to start forming a bond and start parenting- those factoids came SECONDARY. Your first point, and apparent main concern being: your boyfriend's (and his family's) perception of Laura vs. you.\n\nis this *TRULY* about Hailey's and your bf's best interests, or is this about you?", "This sounds like a classic evil stepmother tale. \n\nYou\u2019re scheming to take away Hailey\u2019s mother figure. Laura sounds like the strongest, healthiest, and most consistent parental relationship in her life. I think you should reflect on why you want to do that. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - so you want the only maternal figure she had with a deadbeat dad to go away because you\u2019re jealous?\n\nMaybe she\u2019s not interested in her dad because he\u2019s uninvolved for 11yrs.", "Yta. Your boyfriend should dump you and get with her", "YTA. It doesn't matter how long you have been dating.  Very Clearly she is seen as a mother to the little girl. The woman also brought her up,  you don't think that turns into feelings of motherhood? You cannot separate these two. It's not atypical babysitter deal- it's like a full time mother deal.", "YTA\n\nThe jealousy is just dripping off this story. \n\nI get that you care about your bf, and would like a close relationship with his daughter, but you CANNOT try to take away the only mother figure she knows. Title of \u2018nanny\u2019 aside, Laura is her mother figure. She is her primary caregiver. \n\nYou cannot replace Laura. \n\nWhat you could do is put in some effort to help Laura and be involved in events in your own way. You\u2019ll need to build your own relationship with Hailey that will be different and separate from what she has with Laura. But you can\u2019t just cut Laura off and try to say \u2018I\u2019m the only woman you need in your life now\u2019. \n\nYou trying to get rid of Laura is going to blow up in your face. She is a member of their family, and if your hope is to eventually be part of the family, you need to accept her and be thankful Hailey has someone so loving to care for her.", "YTA\n\nYou obviously know nothing about children in general, and Hailey specifically, if you would suggest that her mother figure (because that\u2019s what Laura is) up and move out.  I get why your bf\u2019s family likes Laura better than they like you.\n\nLaura and Hailey genuinely love each other.  If you\u2019re serious about being with your bf, you need to work with that, rather than against it.", "YTA. Prioritizing what you want over what\u2019s in your potential stepchild\u2019s best interest is immature and selfish at best. \n\nIf you believe that banishing her only mother figure from her life will make Hailey like you more, you\u2019re sadly mistaken. I\u2019m genuinely stunned that anyone would be so incredibly self-centered. You\u2019re treating Hailey like a puppy instead of a human being - taking away her mother won\u2019t make her bond with you instead. \n\nIf you want to be a parent to Hailey, put her needs first. Invite her and Laura out for a girls day. Listen to what Hailey wants. Try to become at least a trusted adult before you insist on being a mother.", "Yta \nSo Laura is a parent to this kid and you just want to take that away? Who the hell do you think you are ?", "YTA stay out of it not your business. Also you sound jealous as all get out. Leave the kid with her nanny.", "YTA\n\nYou want to separate her from her primary caregiver.\n\nBy your own admission, her father is fairly detached from her.

This is a Big One. \n\nYou, as girlfriend, are not in a position to disrupt it. It\u2019s great to want to encourage your boyfriend to become a more invested father. That\u2019s a lovely quality. It\u2019s also wonderful to seek out more opportunities to get to know daughter. But it *is* a scary thought for her to hear you want her \u201cmom figure\u201d to leave. Maybe you can change the boundaries and arrangement years from now; lord knows their relationship *should* change as she grows up. It will have to by necessity. But this is not the way to start, and not this way. \n\nThis is a concern for Hailey and dad, and probably a family therapist. Not you.", "Check your insecurity.

I can't believe you have the nerve to request that her nanny whom she obviously loves move out because.... stepdaughter isn't interested in getting closer to you???? And you're not even married. Yes, your bf should be more involved and interested in his daughter but she has someone in her life that has taken on a parental role and you're threatening to take that away. Of course, Hailey is petrified. I hope your bf realizes that you're not stepmom material and takes that into consideration", "YTA. You actually think Hailey would like you better if you made her nanny move out? This is the beginning of growing resentment and I'd be surprised if you and your boyfriend last. It's not just his daughter, it's his family too; what will they say when they find out about your plan.", "This is almost the same situation with me and my mother. My mother wasn\u2019t really interested in me when I was born so my grandmother raised me. Then in my late teens she tried to between me and my grandmother (her own mother).

I still resent the whole dynamic. \n\nA child can have multiple relationships. A child chooses which ones are most important.

Step away before you cause Hailey further damage.", "YTA - it would be unconscionable to rip away the only mother (or real parent) this child has ever known. My god. This child has been neglected by one parent and abandoned by the other. Thank god Laura had stepped up where your boyfriend failed time and time again. Laura is a saint and no shit his family likes her more than you. You literally are putting your jealousy above the welfare of a child. \n\nPlease break up with this man and leave this child alone.

Haileys mother left when she was around 1 and my boyfriend is pretty uninvolved as a father. \n\nWhen Hailey was 6 months old her mom was dealing with some mental health issues so my boyfriend hired a nanny, Laura, to do everything baby related. He had Laura move in within a couple months of Halley\u2019s mom leaving and Laura is still working for my boyfriend today. \n\nLaura is very close with my boyfriend\u2019s family. She\u2019s with the family every holiday and honestly I think they like her better than me. My boyfriend says she\u2019s become a good friend over the years and he and Laura go out at least once a month. And Laura is extremely involved in Hailey\u2019s life. She\u2019s room mom at her school (I didn\u2019t know you could be room mom without being a mom), she\u2019s at every play, concert, soccer game, etc., she even goes to Hailey\u2019s therapy appointments. Hailey doesn\u2019t do anything for herself because of Laura. Laura wakes her up, packs her backpack and lunch and does her hair every morning and does homework with her every afternoon. She tucks Hailey in every night and sits with her until she falls asleep. \n\nHailey is very attached to Laura and Laura is to Hailey. Laura even takes Hailey out with her on her days off. Hailey has been disinterested in getting closer with me and her dad and I honestly think it\u2019s because of Laura. \n\nI was talking to my boyfriend and said that Hailey\u2019s too attached to Laura and suggested that he be more involved in Hailey\u2019s life since he\u2019s now in a better position to be a father and we can have Laura move out. \n\nHailey heard us and is heartbroken and terrified. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me or leave Laura\u2019s side. She\u2019s faked being sick at school so many times this week that they don\u2019t want her to come back today. Laura says Hailey hasn\u2019t been sleeping and is worried about her. \n\nMy boyfriend is blaming me for all of this but there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve known that Hailey would be eavesdropping or that she\u2019d get this scared.

The woman, the true mother, said \u201cno you can\u2019t cut him in half he will die!

Your son is dead and mine is alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n24 Then the king said, \u201cBring me a sword.\u201d So they brought a sword for the king. 25 He then gave an order: \u201cCut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.\u201d\n\n26 The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, \u201cPlease, my lord, give her the living baby! Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d\n\nBut the other said, \u201cNeither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!\u201d\n\n27 Then the king gave his ruling: \u201cGive the living baby to the first woman.

It's disgusting that you are so jealous you don't care how much you hurt a child.", "I might be crucified for this response, but I am gonna have to say NAH in this regard. OP was having a private conversation with her boyfriend in which she noticed that Hailey has attachment issues to Laura and that Hailey is disinterested in spending time with OP or her own father. This was merely a suggestion, not a demand, and Hailey eavesdropped and now has abandonment issues. Yeah, the father was absent most of the child's life, so he is a major AH for this, but, has anyone stopped to think on how this will impact Hailey long term?\n\nThis child is clearly attached to Laura, as Laura is to her. What if the dad was laid off and could no longer pay Laura to watch his child? What would happen then? What if Laura had a family emergency occur in her life, having her to leave Hailey for a period? How would Hailey react in this situation? What happens when Hailey turns 18 and no longer needs a nanny? What if Laura decides to start her own family and leaves Hailey? You all are thinking about this in the short term instead of how this will impact Hailey for the rest of her life. Laura is all that Hailey knows, and if Laura were to leave from her life, would Hailey break down and close herself off from the rest of the world? It does not seem like she can open up to her father about these things, so she would be suffering in silence.\n\nAt the mere mention of this, Hailey refused to speak to anyone and would not leave Laura's side, as well as she skipped school to the point that the school would not let her back. That is seriously alarming. The way that this was broached was not the best approach, but it does raise a serious concern. OP, I would raise these concerns to your partner and have Hailey go to therapy immediately. Your boyfriend needs to step up and help out with some of Laura's tasks. He needs to prepare her for the eventuality that Laura may leave to pursue her own life. \n\nThere is a tinge of jealousy on your side, with you mentioning that the family cares more for Laura, but you were questioning your boyfriend that the nanny moves out so that Hailey spends more time with her immediate family, and not the nanny.

If you want her father to be more involved, by all means, encourage that too.  But NONE of those things require removing Laura.

Don't you date watch her this afternoon!\" Parents are on 24/7 and need a break, and they know nothing will ever separate them from their child, and they want their kids to get close with people around them. It takes a village but nowadays we don't village raise. All GF has to do to get closer to Hailey is do some stuff with her. It's not that hard. I'm sure Laura would be quite happy to have an evening to herself knowing her basically daughter is getting to bond with someone else who wants to spend time with her.\n\nYou are totally right, she just wants her to have no parent. Laura being present does in no way inhibit either from doing stuff with Hailey, and they can easily say they want to do a bonding activity and I'm sure Laura would be happy to catch up on something else.

She gets paid, but a stay at home Mom would get just as much if not more money, as she would be entitled to all Dad's funds, so unless Dad is in deficit paying Nanny, she's making less than a stay-at-home Mom, but doesn't care because Hailey is her child, and the boyfriend is her coparent and family.

But maybe the involvement can get a little less. I feel like the father has the time and recourses to be able to take care of Hailey without a nanny.

You want to become a real part of their lives and Laura's involvement is slightly preventing you from doing that. But that's not Laura's fault, she did nothing wrong here. And having her be a part of Hailey's life is probably for the best rn. They've built a bond that will never go away.

But...\n\nI say ESH because I think the nanny thing might've gone too far, but you should not blame Laura. Look at your bf. He's attached to a certain lifestyle and Laura helps him provide that, at the cost of bonding with his daughter. Make it clear to him that in later life he and Hailey might not have a real parent-child relationship if he keeps Laura as her primary caregiver. Ask him if he's okay with that.

Spending that much time with a child is going to create a bond well beyond employee/client. It would be cruel to both Hailey and Laura to end this relationship now. Hailey is at a very vulnerable age emotionally and developmentally and it\u2019s one of the hardest times in a child\u2019s life to make big changes. Laura has acted as Haileys mother for 10 years.

There were things he (the licensed general contractor) had to be present for and if something got off schedule, he couldn't just leave.

He was always there. When I was in the marching band he towed the instrument trailer to every game because there was no work thing on Friday nights that could mess him up and if we had away games he would take the day off (at that point they had crew leaders who could function without him as long as he was reachable by phone). \n\nI think sometimes reddit sees fathers who aren't doing the \"day-to-day\" stuff and assume they're just slackers.
