I filed for custody because of an incident (child wasn\u2019t in immediate danger but dad was refusing to give him back and cooperate). Our court agreement is he gets 2 weekends a month and 2 weekdays a month for a few hours. While this worked at first, it was a lot for me and my family as I usually work weekends and also vend at events weekends to make extra money, so figuring out childcare was a lot. I\u2019m the \u201cnot so fun parent\u201d meaning I do all the dr appointments, school drop off, pick up, everything school related, and \u201cimportant\u201d things and majority of stuff for our son. I do consider myself a single mom in a way because I have majority time and do the real responsibilities, where as he gets him weekend and gets to not worry about much but have fun with our son. And at first, he didn\u2019t want additional time after court order (he was mad and being a jerk) and would get mad I asked his family for childcare help because I had no one and he wasn\u2019t working and not giving money. Now he does work monday-friday and pay child support which was court ordered. My son really likes his dad and his dads family and he doesn\u2019t live too far from us. The weekday visit became too difficult for the both of us, so to compromise I have been giving him almost every weekend (what he originally requested in court). Him and his family are flexible and if I want him certain weekends I can keep him, which I do if we have plans or family things. I have been in between jobs and working random ones so I do a lot with my son monday-friday. I have been looking for monday-friday jobs and will likely keep my son more weekends but I just feel like an asshole taking away time from his dad because it\u2019s our routine and our son enjoys his time with his dad. Also, when we were following court order my son would be asking for his dad often. Lately I have just felt really guilty every time my son goes over, especially if I don\u2019t have work. But his dad cannot do weekdays so weekends are his only time. I\u2019m glad my son has a relationship with his dad but I just constantly feel guilty when he\u2019s away. My son\u2019s dad and I pretty much have no contact and communicate via other household members, which makes me feel like a burden and an annoyance, but this isn\u2019t my choice as he just refuses to cooperate, communicate, and is consistently mean to me and makes me feel like I don\u2019t want or love my son by sending him. One time I went out of town on a weekend and his mom found out and asked me where I was and why I didn\u2019t say anything. She found out because my sons dad was stalking my friends social medias.  Despite this, I still do my best to coparent for the sake of my son.

You get all the transportation, homework and early bedtimes/wake up times and dad and his relatives get all the days someone can actually spend time with the child.", "I'm leaning towards NTA, OP. You guys reached that agreement, and you're allowed to do whatever you wish while your ex has your son. If you feel like a burden for communicating through his family, you can all the court for other alternatives, like a social worker, however you may have to pay them for doing so. But they will record anything that's been said among other things I can't remember from the top of my head.  Also it's normal to feel the way you do, co-parenting with people like him makes parenting ish times harder . I do wish you luck on this co-parenting journey and hopefully he cools off.\n\n\nETA: the correct spelling of your. Gotta love swipe keyboard lol", "An incident where the dad is trying to not give the kid back is a big deal, and his snide comments about you being a selfish parent are dangerous to your relationship with your child. :/", "If your ex has the kid more often, couldn't he fight in court to get child support reduced?", "NTA. Life fluctuates. As long as both parties are agreeable to respecting what is best for your son and both of you are capable of give and take. Sometimes it will be easier for dad to have him certain times, in 6 months it may be easier for you. Being able to work together when that happens is important and I congratulate y'all for that.", "I\u2019m not sure how you think you are being TA, you said you have him Monday-Friday every week and you have just swapped weekday custody for weekend custody? The child has a right to see his father, and you are providing it. NAH.\n\nThe only thing is you may well affect the development of your own relationship by giving up \u2018fun time\u2019 with your son, he may draw closer to his father long term and want to live with him when he is older instead, but you said you are looking for weekday work (try schools, they are good, same holidays) so this shouldn\u2019t be a long term issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I don\u2019t think he can go to court and say i\u2019m in contempt because I\u2019m allowing him additional visits", "Our son has started school, he\u2019s enrolled in a private preschool/daycare. Lately since I\u2019ve been in between jobs he only goes when I need the childcare but I do try to send him at least 1-2x a week even if I\u2019m off for a few hours because I didn\u2019t want to mess up his routine after losing my last job because I got fired for taking time off when he was sick. He has friends and has fun. With our arrangement, sadly if my son is sick or I need help during the week it\u2019s entirely on me to figure out. His dad is flexible on weekends, I can pretty much just tell his parents \u201cI\u2019m going to keep him this weekend\u201d and they usually don\u2019t mind and my sons dad won\u2019t mind too much because he can go out. When my son starts actual school and if I work monday-friday, Im thinking of keeping him more weekends but I feel like I am the asshole for taking away time and making his visitation minimal. Previously, he and his family expressed the court order did not give him enough time.", "The only alternative the court really offered was talking through a website where nothing can be deleted. He wouldn\u2019t respond and would just leave messages on delivered or read, even to questions like \u201cwhat time are you getting him or what time do i drop him off\u201d thank you! while it has progressed compared to 2 years ago, it\u2019s still no where near where I want it to be and I just settle for the sake of our son :(", "essentially this is how the incident went: We agreed on a pickup time, he texted me demanding I pick up my son earlier than planned for no legit reason other than he was over it. I was far away and couldn\u2019t do it at that exact time and moment he wanted. he said \u201cfine enjoy this picture this is the last time you\u2019ll ever see him again\u201d and wouldn\u2019t respond to me. and since there was no custody order in place I couldn\u2019t do much. I didnt go to court to be an asshole but I didn\u2019t wanna take the risk of him one day running off with our son.", "Likely not\u2026it\u2019s only 4 more days.", "yeah he could but it likely wouldn\u2019t be reduced by much. in our state parents are required 1/2 of daycare expenses plus child support. Daycare is around $550 a month. half of that is almost $300. and for me having monday-friday he would still be required to pay child support.", "Well, that is not your fault. If dad wants more time. Then, he needs to take weekdays and do some actual parenting. He can do school drop off/ pick ups and arrange childcare just as easily as you can. It isn\u2019t that he can\u2019t parent on weekdays. It\u2019s that he won\u2019t parent on weekdays. Just because he refuses to do any actual parenting does not entitle him to all of your child\u2019s free days.", "You need to address this with your lawyer, too.", "it\u2019s about 4 more overnights a month but we also are not doing the weekday visit anymore. I really don\u2019t think it would get reduced by much. Our sons original \u201cneed\u201d the court calculated was almost $1,200 a month and he pays about 1/2 of that. Plus he\u2019s required 1/2 of daycare expenses, I think if he tried to fight it in court it would be around the same amount required that he\u2019s paying now. Plus he makes significantly more than me", "This. Most single mothers get forced into being the functional parent M-F while the fathers get to be the \u201cfun\u201d parent. My ex used to ask me to drive our daughter up to his house in the next state on his weekends, my response was always \u201cthat\u2019s not happening\u201d. I finally said ok, what days are you dropping her off and picking her up her up from school? He said \u201cI can\u2019t do that, I work\u201d. I said \u201cI can\u2019t bring her up to your house, I work\u201d. He never asked again. It\u2019s a crap situation for the moms, but eventually the kids recognize the imbalance and appreciate us for it.", "Spot on, because he won\u2019t parent weekdays no matter how much I need help. He once told me \u201cyou have him more time so the responsibility should fall on you\u201d when I mentioned needed help with medical appointments because our son does have some medical issues. I think once I start monday-friday job I will keep my son more weekends", "I have and all I was told is \u201cwe can\u2019t force him to answer or talk to you\u201d", "These family courts think that kids are air ferns. I spent 400-600 a week just for a nanny for my daughter, while her father was deemed responsible to pay $50 a week. He currently earn six figures working for the railroad. He was underemployed on purpose until my daughter was 16. My daughter saw through him by age 12.\n\nEdit typo", "It's also his son, so he should also share the responsibilities. If he doesn't want to share the responsibilities he shouldn't expect to have all the fun time. But you probably should a court to reconsider and rearrange your visitation schedule, so it reflects the changes in your situations/availabilities as well as the responsibilities each of you takes on."]}
