He lost his job, so I've been taking care of all expenses including my cat (tuna) everything has been fine he's a bit messy, but otherwise I'm able to take care of the brunt of everything and am the full caretaker of tuna.  \nTwo weeks ago, Tuna got sick, and I took her to the vet. She was alright, but she needed to be on a few pricey medications. When I informed my boyfriend he told me I should just get rid of her because he didn't like her anyway, I was confused because I could pay for this fine, and he always seemed like he liked her. I told him that it was weird he was acting like this, and I told him we'd be financially fine because it was still enough for all the expenses to be taken care of.  \nHe freaked, saying if we spent money on the cat, he wouldn't be able to go on his week-long trip with his friends. I was confused because he said before that his friends were planning to pay for most of the trip only having to cover food himself. He told me that he still wanted money to do other stuff during the trip so he was going to take more than he needed so he could enjoy himself. I reminded him that this was my money and he promised he'd start the process of finding a job before the trip.  \nAfter I was explaining my side and how I needed my cat's medication and I couldn't fund his trip when I was already funding 2 people and a cat. He blew up on me telling me this was his one chance at a break with his friends. I felt hurt because the stress of the expenses and taking care of my cat has been a lot, so I decided to cut the conversation short and say we could talk in the morning.  \nThat morning I went to work as usual after taking care of tuna but when I came back she was nowhere to be found. I freaked out after hours of searching inside and out while my boyfriend just sat on the couch watching TV saying tuna was fine. I put out flyers for her that night and the next morning my neighbor said she saw my boyfriend letting her out. After the call I freaked out on him saying how could he do this I still don't know where she is and she could be dead.  \nHe told me it was for the best and we'd be able to have more money coming in. I yelled at him that if he bothered to look for a job for once we'd have more money coming in and my cat wasn't the cause of it. He got pissed at me and told me it was my fault the cats missing anyway if I just listened and gave her a way he wouldn't of had to do it. I told him he has to leave and to stay with his parents since they'd offered before but he couldn't stay here and we were over. After that he left to stay with his parents and I packed his stuff. I got a call from his mom saying I was being horrible because he just lost his job.\u00a0  \nTuna is happy and getting better but I feel like I went too hard on my boyfriend because multiple people have told me I was in the wrong. I don't feel like I was at fault completely but I could be fully biased and I need to know. AITA?

I yelled at him that if he bothered to look for a job for once we'd have more money coming in and my cat wasn't the cause of it. He got pissed at me and told me it was my fault the cats missing anyway if I just listened and gave her a way he wouldn't of had to do it. I told him he has to leave and to stay with his parents since they'd offered before but he couldn't stay here and we were over. After that he left to stay with his parents and I packed his stuff. I got a call from his mom saying I was being horrible because he just lost his job.\u00a0  \nTuna is happy and getting better but I feel like I went too hard on my boyfriend because multiple people have told me I was in the wrong.

He:\n- Told you to get rid of your cat\n- Told you to do it so he could have more \u201cfun\u201d money for himself during his trip\n- Told you to fund said fun money from YOUR salary while he\u2019s unemployed\n- Lied to you that he\u2019d try to get a job before his trip\n- Threw a tantrum when he realised that you weren\u2019t just gonna obey and get rid of the cat\n- Got rid of your cat himself so he\u2019d get his way\n\nHow many more red flags do you need in a singular post for you to realise that he\u2019s a good-for-nothing asshole trying to take advantage of you.\n\nChange the locks, block him everywhere.

You need to realize finding your pet was a second chance you were given. Not everyone gets that chance.\n\nAbout the guy, he\u2019s a moocher and a deadbeat. He\u2019s cruel and doesn\u2019t give a flying F about your feelings, just getting his way. You don\u2019t want a partner like that to depend on, if you ever are in need. Trust me, the moment you need anything real imposing, like this same situation you\u2019re living, only if it\u2019s you losing your job and he having tu support you, he\u2019ll toss you out like he did with your cat.\n\nEdit: typo", "If you stay with this awful excuse of a man, you don\u2019t deserve Tuna.", "NTA.\n\nHe's a bum and he almost got your pet killed.

Infact it was the best decision, I hope you find Tuna soon :/ \nAnd if mommy is so offended on her son's behalf, she can fund his Living expenses and the trip. \nDefinitely NTA.", "Nat. Your boyfriend is though. The audacity of this guy.", "NTA. My cat of 15 years just passed away last month. I still look for her sometimes. My girlfriend of 3 years (engaged for the 3 months before this) started to get a bit jealous and self centered for the 2 months while trying to care for my cat. I am glad my partner was able to redeem her senses and the whole situation before my cat's journey was finished, because Im sure if it had continued or she pulled some shit like your boyfriend did to Tuna, I wouldnt be with her anymore. \n\nTake care of Tuna. Your pets are the only ones who love unconditionally and always accept you as you are, on your good days and bad days, through the good times and bad times.

Anyone who thinks he was in the right to demand your otherwise-spare cash that was funding the cat's meds for his boys' trip, say you were better off without her, and then try to get her lost/killed to force the point isn't someone you need in your life. Cut them loose along with the loser boyfriend. You would be absolutely crazy to want to build a long-term future with someone this callous and selfish.\n\nNTA!", "Yes, a million times this. I can't believe the cruelty of the situation.  He let your sick cat out AND then proceeded to watch on as you were sick with worry. Both Tuna and you deserve better.", "This is probably the most one sided one of these I\u2019ve ever seen.

She might be on you side for a short time but it\u2019s her son so eventually she will try to convince you it was a \u201cone time lapse of judgement.\u201d What do you want in the kind run? I sure hope it\u2019s not her approval or his remorse - you don\u2019t need it.
