Sophia has a learning disability and the school's disability center gave her a smart pen that records the lectures while she writes notes, so that if she misses anything she can go back and listen. The pen is only compatible with a very specific, very expensive (for a notebook) notebook. \n\nWhen Sophia got the pen, she let us play with it. We recorded ourselves talking or singing while writing or drawing. Olivia chose to write a few curse words and record herself saying them. Sophia told her not to do it again and took the pen and notebook to her room. Well, she got sick a couple weeks after and had to miss a class. Olivia is in the same class so Sophia gave Olivia the pen and notebook and told her to record the class so she could listen to it later. \n\nOlivia chose not to record the class. She decided it would be funny to write curse words/curse Sophia out on the first line of every page and record herself saying/singing the words. Sophia is very embarrassed and refuses to use the notebook. She was able to get the disability center to wipe the recordings from the pen but they refused to replace the notebook because it was still usable.\n\nWhen Sophia told me what happened and that the disability center wouldn't give her a new book, I gave Olivia an ultimatum. Either she buys Sophia a new book or I take her car (registered in my name and under my insurance policy) and she'll have to walk to the bus stop 2 miles away and take the bus to school (which their friends say takes an hour, compared to the 15 minute drive). \n\nWe got on Amazon and the only thing we found that was compatible with Sophia's pen was a set of 4 books for $40. Olivia said she's not going to pay that much but I told her it was either that or the bus so she bought the books. Olivia thinks I'm being unfair and my husband is starting to agree with her but I think it's Olivia's responsibility to replace the book and if the only thing that's available is a 4 pack for $40, well that sucks and hopefully she won't do it again. \n\nAITA for making her buy $40 worth of notebooks after she defaced her sister's?", "created_utc": 1675750293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vukad/aita_for_making_my_daughter_buy_40_worth_of/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wrote curse words on every page. The pen had to be reset. And the notebook is not useable. \n\nShe is getting off lightly", "NTA.\n\nOlivia's behavior -- her failure to take notes that her sister needed, and the insertion of the swear words -- is so far beyond unacceptable, I think we're pretty deep into vicious bully territory.  Making her pay $40 seems like very minimal restitution.  She also needs to find some excellent notes, or someone else who recorded the class.  And if I were you, I'd take the care for a meaningful period of time even after she makes restitution.  \n\nI think that your next move to make Sophia safe from bullying in her own home is to tell Olivia that should she pull anything like this again, should there be one tiny iota of bullying, she'll have one month to find herself another place to live.  Not only is her behavior hurting Sophia, it's modeling bullying as acceptable to your younger child.\n\nGo draconian, Mom.  This kind of behavior should have been stomped out with clear, serious consequences (not replace the thing you wrecked or you'll get a consequence, a consequence beyond restitution) a good decade ago.  Do Not Tolerate Bullying by an adult who should know better under your roof.", "NTA\n\nThose are the consequences of her actions. Also, what a crappy thing to do to a sick sister.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn\u2018t just replace the notebook but in addition do something nice for her sister to apologize for such an unacceptable behavior. \n\nShe\u2018s acting like a 12 years old brat. \n\nAnd no, the punishment is not too extreme. We used bikes to get to bus stops and one hour seems normal to get to school. She\u2018s lucky that she\u2018s allowed to use a car in the first place.", "NTA. Not only was Olivia rude and disrespectful by actively messing with and ruining her disabled sisters accessibility equipment, she also actively hurt Sophia\u2019s education by making it so she can\u2019t go back and listen to the lecture she missed. The joke was cruel in the first place but it also prevented someone with with a disability, her sister no less, from being caught up in a no doubt important and expensive class.\n\nThis punishment is 100% warranted and, honestly, is barely scratching the surface of what she should have to do to make up for it. I think she needs serious help or intervention if she\u2019s consistently bullying Sophia like this as a grown adult. Consequences are just a lesson Olivia needs to learn.", "NTA good job, Mom.\n\nThat was *completely* appropriate. She is way, way too old to do that kind of thing and there is no reason on earth you should coddle that. Maybe don't screw over your sister, mess with her disability accommodations, and deliberately insult/offend her.", "NTA, disrespect someone's stuff and you have to replace it. \n\nWelcome to life, kiddo.", "Hey Olivia\u2014 get your pen out and take down this note: Y T A\n\n(nta)", "NTA Oliva ruined a expensive notebook that is a aid for Sophia's disability it's the same as if she took a blind persons cane and snapped it in half basically. Hopefully this will teach Oliva a needed lesson", "NTA. She should have to replace the accessibility equipment for her disabled sister. I'm sad for you that she had to be threatened to do the right thing. I hope things improve.", "NTA, 40 dollars seems reason me to me.", "NTA\n\n\nShe wrecked the notebook. She can pay for it. I would have done both to teach her a lesson.\n\n\n\nAlso why are they in the same class and college?? I hope you aren't using Olivia to keep tabs on Sophia. And for the future have Sophia contact her center to get lecture notes from missed classes.", "NTA good job mom", "NTA, what's wrong with your daughter? I have a younger sister myself and we do have our issues, but when she asks me a favor for something important like school/university I don't mess around and I try to help her (she reciprocates).", "NTA\n\nOlivia definitely is for doing something so callous and malicious to her own sister.\n\nLater in life she will probably wonder why Sophia doesn't want anything to do with her.", "NTA for having her buy the books.\n\nBut just one question. Are they in the same classes? Because if not... Did you made Olivia miss her own classes in order to record and take notes for Sophia? Because if you did... then you would be an asshole.\n\nOlivia is acting out... and when a child does that (And yes, I'm old enough that 20 years old are children to me), and acts out against a sibling is signs of something else. Are you constantly favoring Sophia? Making Olivia feel left out because she's Neurotypical? Having her have more responsibilities? And things like that?\n\nIf I were you I would talk to Olivia, and try to understand her perspetive and why she did what she did, without judgment, regardless of what she says, and just listen to her.", "NTA. She messed around and found out. Her joke really messed with her sister's product that she really needs. You're not in the wrong. She needs to learn responsibility and what being an adult is about.", "NTA classic case of fuc around n' find out.\n\n\nAnd honestly, why didn't she just write the notes? Like, that would have benefitted her learning as well lmao! \n\n\nI have adhd, and in college, I used my ipad and the app notability to do the exact same thing as Sophia's pen and notebook. The sheer amount of help it was to tap my written notes and have the recording take me back to when the professor was talking about that part of the lecture was a GAME CHANGER.\n\n\nAnd you best believe classmates lined up to study with me because of this.\n\n\n(Some professors didn't allow non-disability students to record thier lectures, so in that sense, my accommodations were a privilege to regular students) \n\n\nOlivia seriously missed out on, not only having a more enriched learning experience, but also gaining hella social capital and rapport with her classmates.  Nta\n\nEdit: It costs less than $40 to not be a poopy sister and it pays a lot more (more worthwhile) to be diligent student! Lol", "NTA! I asked a friend to record an important lecture in a class I was missing due to an academic extracurricular. The professor was in full support of me missing even this very special lecture (it was a speech he gave as an invited guest in the legislative body of a foreign country regarding economic policy) because he (the professor) was very supportive of that activity. Friend who recorded it listed to it before giving me the tape (he recorded it on cassette, we're old!), and said that some parts were unintelligible because he coughed or cleared his throat closer to the recorder, and apologized for it not being a perfect recording.\n\nI could hear almost everything, and the few words that were obscured by him needing to make his throat comfortable in a dry classroom could easily be guessed. I said that he did a great job recording it and I appreciated it.\n\nHe did his best to help me when I had to decide between two equally important academic things. That's what a real friend/supportive person does! Olivia decided to sabotage Sophia for funsies. Olivia paid a small price for doing that! $40 is a lot less than she'll spend in lost time taking the bus to and from school, so the consequences are rational (replace what you broke, with more significant consequences if you refuse to make it right).", "NTA, great parent here!\n\nBut a thing to consider.  Olivia, from her response, is jealous and may have cruel tendencies. \n\nIt is not normal to 20 year old to behave like she is 10 seeing  least favourite classmate's pink pony pencilcase: to obtain, and of not keep to destroy. What makes her so?  Did she show any sign of resentment? From your story she has a car and pretty normal life. \n\nWas she always like this?  \n \nConsider a serious talk between you two.  This tendencies tend to develop in bullying.", "I\u2019m actually going with ESH except for Sophia. Olivia should not have behaved childishly given that she is 20, and it\u2019s only right that she have to replace what she damaged/defaced although since it was only on the first line of every page (not the whole darned page) it probably would have been relatively easy to cover it up, just time consuming. Her punishment was likely a little bit harsh because you are making her pay quadruple the value of he damaged item, but given that the only replacement was a 4-pack then that\u2019s how it goes. The reason I\u2019m going with the ESH verdict is because you have admitted that Olivia, and now the younger sister are bullying Sophia. This tells me that something is happening at home that you are contributing to. The likelihood is that Sophia is getting favored and being treated more as a golden child would because of her learning disability. You may not view it that way, or may not intend it to happen, but something must be happening for both sisters to be ganging up on the 3rd sister meaning they see some sort of favoritism and are lashing out. Have you missed something that the other girls view as a personal achievement because Sophia needed to get to a tutoring session or needed help because of her disability? It\u2019s actually a bit surprising just how fast resentment can build, especially during the teen years when emotions are high and all over the place. It could be a lack of attention, maybe it is golden child syndrome, maybe it\u2019s something else. You want the bullying to stop, you need to find out WHY the bullying is happening then address the issue and correct it. IF it is some sort of favoritism, you need to correct it fast otherwise you are going to eventually be losing two daughters because they aren\u2019t going to want to continue to be treated as 2nd rate once they are out of college and on their own, and they\u2019ll choose to leave and have minimal contact to protect themselves and their own mental health.", "$40 is nothing for what Olivia did. She\u2019s literally just being asked to replace exactly what she ruined. If it were up to me she\u2019d be buying her sister an iPad, an Apple Pencil and the best note taking app of Sophia\u2019s choice to replace what Olivia ruined.
