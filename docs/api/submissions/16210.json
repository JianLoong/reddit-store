It will not cause the dog to stop being friendly.\n\nBoundaries, especially personal boundaries, are *very important* in canine communication. They often have an implicit understanding of it because their own mothers will growl and snap at them for crossing the wrong boundaries, even when they're just teeny little rolly pollies.

She did not \"have a point.\" Many, many people do not want dogs all up in their faces, and Dog Lady is an asshole for thinking that everyone should. She's training her dogs to be annoying. I would expect that _most_ people would say that a dog that gets all up in your face without being invited to do so is a badly trained dog.", "NTA\n\nI love dogs. I've dog-sat for dogs. I do not like my face being licked and avoid it as much as I can. \n\nAnd my favorite dogs right now are absolute lickers so it ain't easy!  I've been almost French-kissed by them way more often than I'd like. Which would be zero if that wasn't clear!", "You should have told her this job wasn't for you the minute she insisted on having you tolerate the slobber and doggy breath. NTA.", "YTA. Time to grow up a little. You certainly don\u2019t need to work somewhere you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. But she was clear from the first visit what her expectations were. The fact that you went back expecting something different, that\u2019s on you. And calling her a name, SMH. You might be too immature to work around adults.", "NTA. She is a horrible dog owner who doesn't train her dogs. Because I guarantee there are many people who don't want dogs to get to close to them against their will and she is doing nothing to respect that. Especially dogs getting too close to someone's face will make people uncomfortable. Not just because it is disgusting, but also out of fear. \n\nEven small dogs have sharp teeth. When she takes out the dogs on a walk and they act like that, especially with small children whose faces they can easily reach, that just leads to conflicts and potential hurt children and euthanized dogs. Because if a child (or maybe even an adult) should react badly out of fear to a dog getting close, hitting the dog painfully on the nose for example, then instincts might take over and the dog could retaliate.", "NTA\n\nShe can try to train her dogs to be friendly if she wants, but that doesn't mean that she had the right to force you to do something that you are uncomfortable with. As long as you are not being outright abusive to the dogs, you are doing absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nI mean. I love dogs myself, but their breath DOES stink, even if they clean their teeth, and you don't have to accept everything about dogs to be a 'dog' person. Some people are just perfectly happy to have a dog lick their hands rather than jump all over them.\n\nLetting a dog do whatever they want is also not necessarily training them to be friendly, but I might be getting off topic a little. You're fine.", "NTA but you could have handled it better. I would leave at the first red flag", "I love your response, made me laugh", "Definitely NTA.

This woman is out of her mind.", "NTA but why didn't you let her demonstrate how it's done properly?", "NTA\n\nNot only is it totally understandable to be grossed put, but it is terrible training. What happens when these dogs think they can do this to literally anyone? Someone is going to get in trouble.\n\nYou'd think someone with so many dogs would learn to train them better. And she went as far to complain about it? What an asshole.", "There was a story some time ago about a chap who ended up having his arms and legs amputated because his dog licked his face, a quick google threw up some other cases.  Very rare, and I think caused because the people had a compromised immune system and the dog had a certain bacteria in their saliva.\n\nPerfectly reasonable that you wouldn't want the dogs licking your face.  I love my dogs, but I certainly don't encourage face licking.  NTA", "* NTA. There are tons of dog lovers who do not like dog saliva baths to their face, myself included. Some dogs really get into this and overdo it if you let them, and she wants you to endure this, X 6? This is not just one dog but SIX she wants you to let them have their way with YOUR face. Ask her if she ever washed out a dogs water bowl. It can\u2019t be done in just one wash. It has to be repeatedly washed and rinsed to get what is equal to slug slime in my opinion, to get rid of the slime coating which is chuck full of bacteria and possibly microscopic worms they may have from licking their own or from the other 5 dog in the packs, butts.   \nHas she provided 6 negative daily worm fecal testing results to you before she insists you allow them to plant their butt sniffing, licking, mouths slobbering in proximity to your mouth? No one under any circumstances has the right to tell you you must allow the very disgusting act of a long drawn out tongue bath on your face till the dog is sated, much less to force you to allow SIX dogs access to slobber all over your face.   \nThe woman is insane and you are a hero for rightly putting a stop to her trying to control what you allow to have applied to your face and mouth in the form of slobber drool saliva from an animal that licks its own and other dogs butts and various dead smelly bacteria laden finds off the ground. You don\u2019t need her type as a client at any price. She is a bully and a control freak thinking because she pays you as a dog sitter, you are to allow her animals whatever makes them happy.   \nMaybe they would like to run off leash by the road, or eat chocolate, crap in her bed, or jump on small children and knock them down etc etc\u2026 Should these things that make her dogs happy be allowed too? Shes a bully and an ass for not accepting your boundary for YOUR own health and comfort level reasons. She can let them lick her face all she wants, but cannot force you to accept it as part of a dog sitter/walker job, and tell you \u201csoon you will be fond of it\u201d. Your body your choice.", "NTA. Dogs literally eat cat poop for fun.", "NTA I think you should have just said \"this isn't going to work out\" and left, but she's ridiculous trying to force you to let her dogs be all over you like that.", "I have the cutest, bounciest, good Boi and he gives the best kisses. His mouth stays away from my face because gross. Dog breath.", "Literally one of the training methods I use to discourage jumping/nipping is withdrawal of attention. \n\nDoggo learns \"Oh, if I jump up, the cuddles are gone.\"\n\nIt doesn't take them long to figure it out.", "But calling the woman a weirdo is wrong.", "Agreed. \n\nI have a friend who lets their dog lick the inside of their mouth, even right after it cleaned itself. It makes me gag every time I see it. I don't say anything because it's not my place but... <upset noise>", "\u201cWilling to risk your health\u201d give me a fucking break.

That's a hell of a lot of bacteria you're letting a dog put all over your face. So no, I won't give you one, *you actually are risking your health letting dogs slobber all over your face.* It's why taking the time to train a dog not to to people who are guests in your home. And while I, as I said to another elsewhere here, I'm not going to pretend to make excuses for the lack of professionalism there, but it really shouldn't be neglected that the client in question here also insulted OP simply because she didn't want to have 6 dogs put her in a position where she would become ill.Not that I am justifying OP there, but if a client is putting you in a situation that could land you in the hospital with a bacterial infection, I can't say OP wasn't justified in dropping her.", "You can if you are a private contractor like OP. There's no \"customer service\" to complain to.", "Hey you\u2019re def right, she was clear with what she wanted and OP noped out as she has every right to, but as a dog owner and animal welfare worker, I think most dog owners/workers/and fans would find this at least a little off putting lol\n\nNAH, but a bit strange of an expectation was more my point \n\nsorry if I made that unclear by agreeing with a comment I now realize says NTA at the end", "That\u2019s still better smelling that the family dog that preferred to get into the litter box.. knowing that most dogs will happily eat diapers and cat shit is why I never let any dog lick my face.", "It can be really hard on older cats, they aren't great.", "HA! Fucking amazing that this comment gets downvoted. How sad. \n\nGeneralizations are just signs of dumb-assery", "My friends dog thought cat shit was a delicacy and would constantly try to get to the litter box no matter where they put it.

I never let that dog get close to my face.", "And sniffing each other's butts", "I would refuse to consider sitting for these dogs if the owner insisted I let them walk over my boundaries.", "From what I've read, it's mostly that the idea of \"cleanliness\" is too subjective to be useful here. Humans do tend to have *more* bacteria, but dogs tend to have *worse* bacteria, so there isn't really a useful metric for establishing which is \"cleaner.\" \n\nOne article (that I've since lost to time) made an interesting analogy comparing human mouths to dogs'. \"Who would you rather have babysit: Ten Hell's Angels, or one sex offender?\"", "Oh please, your whole premise is nonsense considering she's 24 years old.
