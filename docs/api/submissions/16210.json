It will not cause the dog to stop being friendly.\n\nBoundaries, especially personal boundaries, are *very important* in canine communication. They often have an implicit understanding of it because their own mothers will growl and snap at them for crossing the wrong boundaries, even when they're just teeny little rolly pollies.

They may require you to do silly things like give them food in special bowls, dress them up, walk them at only specific times, play with them using specific toys, and maybe even always using a specific tone of voice with them.\n\nIt's not really up to you to train someone else's dogs counter to their desires nor your job to judge them for their pet behaviors.
