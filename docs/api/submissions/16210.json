It will not cause the dog to stop being friendly.\n\nBoundaries, especially personal boundaries, are *very important* in canine communication. They often have an implicit understanding of it because their own mothers will growl and snap at them for crossing the wrong boundaries, even when they're just teeny little rolly pollies.

They eat their poop sometimes, too. This client had not only an unreasonable request from OP, but one that could have the potential to get them DEATHLY sick. Bacteria is a bitch. Besides, something tells me that this client wouldn't have had a different reaction to \"calmly.\"", "It can be pretty bad. Dog diets consist of mostly meat and snacks of literal shit sometimes, then add the lack of toothbrushing (though owners should be cleaning them)", "By the sounds of it she was looking at the camaras so it would be every time they wanted to. Some dogs are worse and not every likes been licked and slobbered on.", "Would you want six humans licking your face and breathing directly into your nose?", "Dog breath can easily cross over into \u201cnoxious\u201d territory. If OP is particularly sensitive to strong smells I could totally see them feeling sick!", "Depends what you feed them and how long since food. Ours are on a raw diet and i don't let them near my face for an hour or so since they're devoured their oily fish and tripe", "Oh it can be infernally bad. We had a dog with chronic gastrointestinal issues and sometimes I swear his mouth was a portal straight into his butthole.", "Dog owner lady I know it\u2019s you", "Humans usually brush their teeth, dogs usually don't. Dogs also lick their assholes instead of showering. So yeah it can be pretty bad.", "As an owner of a stinkyface dog, yes. Yes they can be.", "It absolutely can. I have 4 dogs and sometimes their breath smells rank.", "Dogs lick their butts and the butts of other dogs. They also like to eat their own poop sometimes. I never ever recommend letting a dog lick your face or mouth. Ewww. \n\nNTA", "I'm not wondering because I have experienced a lot of disgusting dog breath. They eat shit and all manner of disgusting things when they are outside. They lick their balls and ass. The food is gross.", "I\u2019m a dog walker and have had to repeatedly redirect dogs from trying to eat poop before, so pretty bad, also consider that they use their tongues as toilet paper, their food is made from the parts of animals considered unfit for human consumption and they do not have a regular dental hygiene regime like we do, some people will brush their dog\u2019s teeth, but not everyone or every day. So their breath is generally worse than humans and also some people are more sensitive to odours and easily nauseated in general. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love dogs and will let them lick me sometimes, but I think the owner\u2019s expectation that OP can\u2019t enforce any personal space is excessive.", "Dogbreath is disgusting", "in my experience it kinda depends on how old the dog is. my dog is 13yo and his breath smells like straight death but my boyfriends dog is only a year and a half and his breath isn\u2019t GREAT but its definitely bearable lol", "Yes. Why are you so set on convincing everyone that the breath (and spit on your face) of an animal that eats its own poop is \u201cjust fine\u201d And \u201cNot that bad\u201d do you not understand that it\u2019s the proximity to the face that\u2019s disgusting? I pick up my dog\u2019s poop in a thin little bag every single day with no issue but I would NEVER let that poop or the mouth of something that ate that poop get near my FACE", "Yes. Yes it can be THAT foul. You should be very thankful you\u2019ve never had a dog with breath that foul in your face. I love my dogs, I\u2019m obsessed with my dogs. I brush their teeth and give them dental treats almost daily. I don\u2019t let them breathe in my face because their breath its still so freaking nasty.", "If it's making you feel sick and you find it disgusting, tell her.", "Yes, exactly! When my dog wants to jump, I turn away. When my dog wags his tails and leans on me, I won't turn away.", "i have met MANY dog people like this, and worse. i tend to avoid dog people because they act as if dogs can do no wrong", "i\u2019ve seen trained dogs do the exact same thing but okay. god forbid anyone say anything bad about dogs \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "I never asked her to adhere to the request but to only deal with it properly.\n\nAlso, I have 2 dogs.", "...after eating dog food and licking their arsehole and genitals.", "That might make me sicker. But then again, I'm immune compromised and have absolutely picked up bordetella from my pooches.", "This really made me laugh, cos i thought u were replying to smileyfacepicnic!!!", "Big same, I tell my partner if my dog's had dinner when he's gets home - if only so he can avoid the fish licks. Dogs mouths are pretty ok, esp if you brush em, but egg, tripe and salmon oil isn't gonna be pleasant no matter what you do.", "Sometimes my dog gets into the cats' food and I can tell because she walks up to belch fish breath into my face.", "My dogs lick each other's assholes multiple times a day. NTA. Their breath can also really stink, because they don't brush their teeth. No thanks. I have let dogs lick my face, but I washed it after. And it is different when it happens without consent as well", "I usually do tell people this, but the amount of people dismissing my feelings \u201cits cleaner then a human mouth\u201d \u201cstop overreacting\u201d, its making me happy to see more reasonable people on here who aren\u2019t offended by things like this", "Sure some are ridiculous but most people with dogs I know train their dogs and are aware they're animals and will make mistakes", "Dogs will try to do this sort of thing whether they have training or not. It's an instinct. But you don't have to allow it, and when you teach them other behaviors instead, they don't try to lick your face as much. \n\nI hate it, so I've taught mine (with treats) that they can press their noses or the sides of their face against mine instead. And if they act like they might lick, I turn away or give a verbal correction,and they respect it. \n\nSitting down for six dogs to lick your face is my idea of hell.", "It\u2019s not because you complain about weird people like this or bad behaved dogs, it\u2019s because you are being kinda rude when you say it", "And eating vomit and other animals' poo", "u forgot to mention \"no less\"...  \ud83d\ude02", "ugh. The tripe. I can barely open the can and they're all over me drooling for it. Disgusting.", "most people i have met have pretty shitty dogs. i guess we just have different experiences and biases lol", "i said nothing rude at all, dog people just can\u2019t handle anyone saying anything bad about dogs.", "Don't forget the occasional bits of dead things that they discover."]}
