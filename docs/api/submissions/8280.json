She doesn't even talk to you. for all you know she has insurance covering the cost now and is using your money to take another man out on dates.

She doesn't care about you.", "as a diabetic i agree, YWNBTA, she needs to figure out how to pay for (or get insurance to cover) her insulin. You paying is not a long term solution and this is an issue she\u2019ll need to deal with for life (if she\u2019s T1)", "I'm diabetic, and even I agree she can take care of herself now.

I can assure you that her friends and family are gonna call you an A H, do a  go fund me with your ex info, send them the link if they're concern. And cut her out of your life. \n\nLast little thing, you should tell her that you're not gonna pay anymore, maybe not in person, juste a little email or text for the heads up.

Ordinarily I would say it's ridiculous to give a cheating ex notice that you won't be sending her money anymore, she cheated on you!! But with it being her insulin which she needs to live, in this case you could let her know you won't be sending her any more money ahead of time. \n\nShe's not entitled to your money at all, and to put it plainly, keeping herself alive is her responsibility, not yours. Give her notice if you need to for your conscious' sake, but definitely DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES let her convince you to keep sending her money.", "Stop sending your ex money. Period. \n\nNTA\n\nCompanies that produce insulin have programs that assist people who need assistance.

Stay kind and you\u2019ll find someone more deserving of you.", "You're a really kind person. \nBut, yeah you shouldn't send more money. Not only because of what she did but because you're setting yourself up to have a fight with your future partner when this comes to surface. Also...now it's fresh and you two know each other, but In one year? Two years? When will it stop? It's better that this is over now. Her life it's not at risk, only her lifestyle.", "NTA at all. \n\nWhat you need to ask yourself isn\u2019t if you\u2019re the asshole. What you should ask is \u201cif I stop sending money and something then happens to her medically (which to be clear would be her fault/responsibility, not yours) will I be able to accept the fact that I am in no way responsible?\u201d\n\nTo be clear, I absolutely think you should stop giving her money (I personally would give a 1-prescription warning to her before entirely stopping but that\u2019s just because my dad has the \u2018betus and im a bleeding heart) but just make sure that YOU are okay with whatever the outcome may be.", "Share your beautiful generosity and compassion with someone who deserves it! You deserve so much better.", "Just an FYI depending on the diabetic insulin or shot, most manufacturers can have you sign up for their savings card and you only pay 25 a month.

You deserve better and to be happy :) So not, NTA", "NTA I'm a socialist commie who is in favor of Universal Healthcare for all Americans...except your ex. \n\n \n\nYou're an Onion headline: Former Sugar Daddy still buying Insulin for his ex.", "NTA.

She can look into it.", "It\u2019s no longer your responsibility to help her do Jack shit.. she needs to figure out how to take care of herself. Sounds like she was only with you to get what she could out of you.. stop the cash flow and move the fuck on with your life.", "Oh gosh, you and your family are kind. nTA and stop giving her money.", "NTA.

The Inflation Reduction Act went into effect as of January 1, 2023.  Using the provisions of the act, the out of pocket cost of a month of insulin is capped at $35.

Pharma has programs for insulin costs, when I was on it I took advantage of the no questions free month which was prescribed at a high dosage and I was on it 4 mos.

How about the guy she cheated on you with?", "And she should\u2019ve thought about her insulin before she cheated on him", "For real.", "I don't know why her cheating a** would assume he would still pay for anything. She made a decision...she has to live with. And she seems highly manipulative. She cheated on him but giving him the silent treatment and acting like its his fault.", "This is def bait", "I want to tell you to stop sending her money, but I'm also not sure what I'd do in your shoes. Are you worried at all that once you stop funding her insulin, she'll badmouth you to other people, accuse you of being abusive, etc.?"]}
