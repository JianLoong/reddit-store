{"id": 15813, "submission_id": "130l4qj", "title": "AITA for not knowing what to do about my bffs panic attacks", "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nMe (21F) and my best friend (22F) have been best friends for about 6 years. Last year, she supported me through a very difficult period in my life (a bad breakup), and now she's going through a rough patch, but I'm getting kinda worn down by trying to be there for her. From now on I'm gonna call her Jane. Here's the story:\n\nSince April last year, Jane has suffered from episodes of fainting out of nowhere, pretty intense hypochondria, anxiety and panic attacks due to her fear of fainting. She has seen a doctor a few times to ensure that she's healthy, and the doctors haven't found any issues with her. She also has a huge fear of doctors and blood tests, so every time she has to go it becomes quite the ordeal with people having to go with her, comforting her and trying to get her to not faint. I feel like me and her other close friends are doing our best to be there for her through these times, but it's not easy since we're not professionals. \n\nThis has also become a problem because Jane has recently started expressing to me and some of her other friends that she's disappointed that we don't check up on her and comfort her enough when she's anxious or sad. This makes me upset because I really try my best to be a good friend to her, and to be there for her. Jane's by far the person I spend the most time on and give the most attention to. And her confronting me about not being enough has made me feel inadequate and like I'm walking on eggshells around her anytime her issues come up, which is basically every time we hang out. \n\nThese problems are getting more and more frequent, and I'm starting to feel like they're taking a toll on my health as well. Firstly, I'm hurt from her implying that I'm not helping her enough, and secondly I feel like every time we hang out becomes a \"test\" where she's reviewing everything I say and do when she talks about her issues. Because when she has confronted me recently, she brings up different times where she feels like I didn't say or do the right thing. Honestly, the friendship doesn't feel fun anymore. I feel terrible saying it, but Jane's problems have become like a wet blanket, and we can't hang out anymore without her health issues being the main focus of all conversations and activities. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to take a step back from Jane a while? Or for wanting to tell her that: I'm not a professional and I can't do any better than my best? I kinda feel like a bad friend since she supported my through my rough patch, but at the same time, I was also seeing a therapist simultaneously, and my rough patch only lasted a few months.\n\nI hope this post made some sense, english is not my first language. If you have any questions to get more clarity on the situation, feel free to ask.

Part of me feels like I should be able to do more for her, but another part of me realizes that it wouldn't feel genuine from my part if I comforted her like she wants, which is to shower her with love, comfort and validation. I think she might need a therapist, and to re-evaluate the expectations she has on her friends to support her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You've done your best to be there, this is becoming a very one-sided friendship.", "NTA  \nOP, I want to be honest with you. This isn't right. \n\nI understand that you want to be a good friend and \"pay her back\", but you're being caught up in her problems and that's not fair.   \nYou're not her therapist, you're not a punching bag and you're enough.   \nShe's being inconsiderate and not a good friend. I get she isn't her true self, but she doesn't have to behave like this. Talk to her, tell her how she is making you feel without being judgemental. It's okay, i promise. She should talk to a therapist.\n\nAlso, i think she could have narcolepsy, but i'm not a doctor.", "NTA Jane needs to learn how to help herself. She shouldn't depend on others, nor should she criticize what you do or don't do to \"help\".  She sounds exhausting and probably should be in therapy if she isn't already. I have panic attacks. There's not really much anyone can do to help, other than not be annoying. ;) Sometimes it helps to take long deep breaths, go for a walk, etc.. Or meds...", "NTA. Not at all. You're not a professional, she's not your client, you're going to get so worn out by caring for her and being responsible for her mental health. I used to be the person who got so anxious and expected people to cater to my every whim. It was awful, for me and for others. My mental health was so bad, and nothing people did was enough. With enough anxiety, you just get paranoid that people hate you, so you expect them to do more and more to support you to prove it...but they can't. The only thing that can prove it is by working with a licensed therapist to help yourself and getting better.\nIt may be rough, but you might want to tell her how you have been feeling, thats its been hard for you too, and that you can't do anymore. Maybe help provide resources, like therapists or support groups? And then leave. Sounds awful but its going to drain you so bad if you stay friends right now. Do whats best for you, because that is what is best for everyone.", "NTA.  Like you said, you are not a professional.  But are you encouraging Jane is see one?  You are being a supportive friend, but that support can only stretch so far.  Encourage Jane to seek help from a therapist for her anxiety and panic attacks.", "NTA. It seems like she\u2019s grown accustomed having you and your mutual friends as a safety net. Now that her needs transcend that, it\u2019s probably best that you voice how much you\u2019re putting forth to look after her & be honest about how unhealthy things have become. I\u2019d still try to reassure her & be as polite as possible, though.", "NTA. Others above have said most of what I wanted to say, but I\u2019d like to add the old aphorism: \u2018Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others around you warm.\u2019", "ESH - Jane has unhealthy expectations of friends and clearly needs therapy to process her feelings of entitlement and anxious attachment.\n\nOTOH, \"pulling away from\" Jane is a cop-out solution, and frankly cruel, if she is really your bff. It has nothing to do with what you owe her for being there for you, but with how any friend should treat someone they love and someone that is trusting enough to confide in them and \"let their freak flag fly,\" so to speak. It is really hard to be open about mental health issues for exactly this reason: fear of rejection. You will only validate and deepen that fear if you start ghosting her, which is a non-confrontational way to make things easier on yourself but that ultimately is selfish and lacking in maturity. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you have tried pushing back on Jane or confronting these behaviors lovingly and firmly. Disappearing or suddenly becoming distant will cause Jane much more pain than necessary, given her current state, and she is likely to catastrophize and make assumptions about what is driving your behavior. \n\nStonewalling is the flip side of anxious attachment, and it is not healthy friend behavior (though it is understandable, just as anxious attachment makes sense from the perspective of the person acting that way).\n\nTell Jane you are feeling overwhelmed and want to help her, but you can't, and it's hard to hear her taking it out on you. Tell her you will show up for her in many ways, like letting her crash with you when she is feeling lonely or anxious, but that you cannot read her mind and should not be expected to anticipate her needs. \n\nTell her what you are telling us here, in the loving and gentle way befitting a BFF. \n\nDon't just abandon her and exacerbate the problems she is currently facing.", "NTA, friendship is a mutual thing, yes. Where u support each other, but that only works to a certain capacity. You have to think of urself first, no one has the right to \"demand\" more of you thn that [or imply that u doing your best isnt enough] you deserve your own space too", "NTA.\n\nYou and your friends are not therapists. But seriously, if she's really taking notes from get-togethers to list all the ways, you all could have been more supportive that's ridiculous.\n\nShe needs proper medical help, whether she really has a medical condition or it's anxiety, she needs proper help.", "She needs professional help.

You've tried your best OP, now you need to step back and breathe, and provide whatever support you can,and only as a supplement to professional help.", "You are not her therapist. In fact, her asking you for reassurance is part of her anxiety disorder. It temporarily makes her feel better but it just gets worse over time, needing more and more reassurance. She needs professional mental health care.", "Then wouldn\u2019t it be one sided when the friend was helping her", "this is really good advice. and something i wished my ex friends could have understood. which i feel like i can say because i did tell them very clearly and repeatedly. i do hope OP sees this.\n\nstonewalling or neglecting is not the answer. you can set boundaries and stick to them, and remember that sticking to those boundaries is more important than making sure your friend is ok. you can prioritise your own mental health and be there for your friend. think about what you need. one day a week to focus on yourself and no one else? just an example, you know best OP\n\none thing i wished for was for friends to do friend things with. i think you can get caught up in trying to be a caretaker, which is normal when your loved ones are hurting, but it will be much better for both of you to do something fun. movie night or go to the park or window shopping even, idk what you guys are into, anything that would be a fun distraction. the serotonin boost will be good for you both.", "Note the word \"becoming.\"\n\nYeah, OP feels bad because her friend helped her before.
