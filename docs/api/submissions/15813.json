{"id": 15813, "submission_id": "130l4qj", "title": "AITA for not knowing what to do about my bffs panic attacks", "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nMe (21F) and my best friend (22F) have been best friends for about 6 years. Last year, she supported me through a very difficult period in my life (a bad breakup), and now she's going through a rough patch, but I'm getting kinda worn down by trying to be there for her. From now on I'm gonna call her Jane. Here's the story:\n\nSince April last year, Jane has suffered from episodes of fainting out of nowhere, pretty intense hypochondria, anxiety and panic attacks due to her fear of fainting. She has seen a doctor a few times to ensure that she's healthy, and the doctors haven't found any issues with her. She also has a huge fear of doctors and blood tests, so every time she has to go it becomes quite the ordeal with people having to go with her, comforting her and trying to get her to not faint. I feel like me and her other close friends are doing our best to be there for her through these times, but it's not easy since we're not professionals.\n\nThis has also become a problem because Jane has recently started expressing to me and some of her other friends that she's disappointed that we don't check up on her and comfort her enough when she's anxious or sad. This makes me upset because I really try my best to be a good friend to her, and to be there for her. Jane's by far the person I spend the most time on and give the most attention to. And her confronting me about not being enough has made me feel inadequate and like I'm walking on eggshells around her anytime her issues come up, which is basically every time we hang out.\n\nThese problems are getting more and more frequent, and I'm starting to feel like they're taking a toll on my health as well. Firstly, I'm hurt from her implying that I'm not helping her enough, and secondly I feel like every time we hang out becomes a \"test\" where she's reviewing everything I say and do when she talks about her issues. Because when she has confronted me recently, she brings up different times where she feels like I didn't say or do the right thing. Honestly, the friendship doesn't feel fun anymore. I feel terrible saying it, but Jane's problems have become like a wet blanket, and we can't hang out anymore without her health issues being the main focus of all conversations and activities.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to take a step back from Jane a while? Or for wanting to tell her that: I'm not a professional and I can't do any better than my best? I kinda feel like a bad friend since she supported my through my rough patch, but at the same time, I was also seeing a therapist simultaneously, and my rough patch only lasted a few months.\n\nI hope this post made some sense, english is not my first language. If you have any questions to get more clarity on the situation, feel free to ask. Thanks Reddit <3\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the responses! Many people are asking if I've recommended professional help, and of course I've done that! I suggested it almost immediately almost a year ago, and she said she was gonna look into it, but kinda postponed it. I asked her again last week and she said she's going to call some next week. So therapy is in the works.

Part of me feels like I should be able to do more for her, but another part of me realizes that it wouldn't feel genuine from my part if I comforted her like she wants, which is to shower her with love, comfort and validation. I think she might need a therapist, and to re-evaluate the expectations she has on her friends to support her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're not a professional, she's not your client, you're going to get so worn out by caring for her and being responsible for her mental health. I used to be the person who got so anxious and expected people to cater to my every whim. It was awful, for me and for others. My mental health was so bad, and nothing people did was enough. With enough anxiety, you just get paranoid that people hate you, so you expect them to do more and more to support you to prove it...but they can't. The only thing that can prove it is by working with a licensed therapist to help yourself and getting better.\nIt may be rough, but you might want to tell her how you have been feeling, thats its been hard for you too, and that you can't do anymore. Maybe help provide resources, like therapists or support groups? And then leave. Sounds awful but its going to drain you so bad if you stay friends right now. Do whats best for you, because that is what is best for everyone.", "NTA.  Like you said, you are not a professional.  But are you encouraging Jane is see one?  You are being a supportive friend, but that support can only stretch so far.  Encourage Jane to seek help from a therapist for her anxiety and panic attacks.", "NTA. It seems like she\u2019s grown accustomed having you and your mutual friends as a safety net. Now that her needs transcend that, it\u2019s probably best that you voice how much you\u2019re putting forth to look after her & be honest about how unhealthy things have become. I\u2019d still try to reassure her & be as polite as possible, though.", "NTA. Others above have said most of what I wanted to say, but I\u2019d like to add the old aphorism: \u2018Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others around you warm.\u2019", "ESH - Jane has unhealthy expectations of friends and clearly needs therapy to process her feelings of entitlement and anxious attachment.\n\nOTOH, \"pulling away from\" Jane is a cop-out solution, and frankly cruel, if she is really your bff. It has nothing to do with what you owe her for being there for you, but with how any friend should treat someone they love and someone that is trusting enough to confide in them and \"let their freak flag fly,\" so to speak. It is really hard to be open about mental health issues for exactly this reason: fear of rejection. You will only validate and deepen that fear if you start ghosting her, which is a non-confrontational way to make things easier on yourself but that ultimately is selfish and lacking in maturity. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you have tried pushing back on Jane or confronting these behaviors lovingly and firmly. Disappearing or suddenly becoming distant will cause Jane much more pain than necessary, given her current state, and she is likely to catastrophize and make assumptions about what is driving your behavior. \n\nStonewalling is the flip side of anxious attachment, and it is not healthy friend behavior (though it is understandable, just as anxious attachment makes sense from the perspective of the person acting that way).\n\nTell Jane you are feeling overwhelmed and want to help her, but you can't, and it's hard to hear her taking it out on you. Tell her you will show up for her in many ways, like letting her crash with you when she is feeling lonely or anxious, but that you cannot read her mind and should not be expected to anticipate her needs. \n\nTell her what you are telling us here, in the loving and gentle way befitting a BFF. \n\nDon't just abandon her and exacerbate the problems she is currently facing.", "NTA, friendship is a mutual thing, yes.

But seriously, if she's really taking notes from get-togethers to list all the ways, you all could have been more supportive that's ridiculous.\n\nShe needs proper medical help, whether she really has a medical condition or it's anxiety, she needs proper help.", "She needs professional help.

You've tried your best OP, now you need to step back and breathe, and provide whatever support you can,and only as a supplement to professional help.", "You are not her therapist. In fact, her asking you for reassurance is part of her anxiety disorder. It temporarily makes her feel better but it just gets worse over time, needing more and more reassurance. She needs professional mental health care.", "Then wouldn\u2019t it be one sided when the friend was helping her", "this is really good advice. and something i wished my ex friends could have understood. which i feel like i can say because i did tell them very clearly and repeatedly. i do hope OP sees this.\n\nstonewalling or neglecting is not the answer. you can set boundaries and stick to them, and remember that sticking to those boundaries is more important than making sure your friend is ok. you can prioritise your own mental health and be there for your friend. think about what you need. one day a week to focus on yourself and no one else? just an example, you know best OP\n\none thing i wished for was for friends to do friend things with. i think you can get caught up in trying to be a caretaker, which is normal when your loved ones are hurting, but it will be much better for both of you to do something fun. movie night or go to the park or window shopping even, idk what you guys are into, anything that would be a fun distraction. the serotonin boost will be good for you both.", "Note the word \"becoming.\"\n\nYeah, OP feels bad because her friend helped her before. But her friend is not only asking for an unreasonable amount of support in lieu of professional help, but is also criticizing OP for not being good enough.", "The difference is OP wasn\u2019t criticizing Jane for how she comforted her/helped her get through her rough patch.", "First you're NTA. I get that she feels alone and having a hard time with whatever is happening and abandoned possibly by medical professionals BUT you are not the ones that can fill that specific void for her. You can be there when she visits them but you are, like you said, not them. And if she fears you all abandoning her too, this isn't helping.\n\nSecond: We have a thing we prioritize in the disability community and it's: Selfcare first. You cannot be there for anyone if you are burning out. \n\nYou are going to have to talk to her about these things. \n\nQuestion: Did all the symptoms start around the same time? Are they worse when she standing or moving around? Cause there is a chronic illness that isn't commonly tested for (one I have) called POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) that can cause fainting. It also gives you heart palpitations and symptoms that mimic anxiety and panic because your nervous system gets whack. Not knowing what is wrong with you can induce stress and not help. \n\nI'm very careful with actually believing hypochondria diagnoses because it does often happen that eventually an actual diagnosis is found. It is common in the disability community that diagnosis happens after you researched things yourself and bring possibilities to the doctor. Especially General Practitioners do not deal well with answers that aren't clear cut. That being said: check it out yourself and only if you think it's worth checking out for her, bring it up as a possibility. I do not think getting her hopes up for an answer is helping.", "NTA as someone who also gets a lot of anxiety from bloodwork and doctors, these are her problems to figure out. She needs to step back and analyze why these are happening and seek professional help. I talked to my doctor about my anxiety and she was helpful in helping me get to the point where I don't get nauseous or blackout \n\nShe needs to address and work on these things. Not rely on you to do everything and magically know all the right things to do.", "NTA. \n\nit kinda sounds like POTS, not to armchair diagnose. i also have it and that sounds similar to what i go through", "NTA .\n\nI went through something extremely similar last year, like she is going through. Like it's actually quite unnerving how similar our experience sounds. \n\nThat being said she needs therapy, and you are completely within your rights to feel like you do and wanting to step back. It doesn't sound like she is taking your feelings, needs and mental energy into consideration at all. \n\nA friendship shouldn't feel burdensome even if someone is going through a rough patch, that's a sign that she might be expecting too much of you.", "NTA. This friendship is very one sided. I understand that she may feel unsafe in her own body, but she is taking you for granted. I bet she hasn't listened to you for months", "ESH.\n\nWhile you went through a rough patch, Jane is suffering from mental illness.  For some perspective, your worst day during that time was probably her best.  She is basically experiencing everything through \"beer goggles\", except instead of bad things looking good, everything looks bad to her.\n\nYou shouldn't feel bad about wanting to take a step back from her, you need to do that.  You shouldn't feel bad about telling her that you're not a professional either.\n\nThe reason why I'm saying ESH, is that you haven't addressed how you're going to do these things in a delicate manner, and you haven't spoken about how you and your friends have supported her getting the mental help she needs.  Perhaps you have done those things, but it sounds like you haven't.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve had \u201cfriends\u201d like that who ended up being emotional vampires.\n\nYou\u2019re not a professional and you need to keep repeating that she arranges therapy for herself.

Like, you can *die* from fainting if you hit something wrong. \n\nIf she's had COVID, you should tell her about POTS. It's now known that Covid can trigger it, and it's something that both causes fainting and often gets dismissed as anxiety, especially if someone is already known to be anxious.", "NTA \n\nYou are supposed to be friends, not her free therapists/emotional support animals.

Based on the info I don't think she has it. I think ops friend sounds like she needs to get the bottom of what's triggering these things. \n\nAdvice for OP it's okay to take a step back from your friend too. Your health is important and she isn't being honest about what she needs from you as a friend. You are not a mind reader and you are not in charge of her. While it's okay to be there as support for her, she shouldn't be testing you and your other friends. Be honest with her in the sense of trying to get to the bottom of what's going on with her.

I have one myself and it can be very scary not knowing if you are going to pass out, bash your head on something and die. I've already broken my nose that way. So I don't think she's an AH for wanting help/comfort or having anxiety because of it. However, her demanding so much of your time and then telling you it's not enough does make her an AH. She needs to bite the bullet and get tests done. It took me many years to get an answer for my fainting issue, and the fight to get it has a lot of ups and downs. It's fine to look to friends and family for support, but you have to take responsibility that the condition is yours and you can't demand everyone put their life on hold to help you.", "Beautiful analogy. \ud83c\udfc5\ud83d\udc4f"]}
