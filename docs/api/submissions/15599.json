I make ~90k a year and he makes 35k. He also has cc debt from not making enough to survive on and medical debt. I pay $2000 of our $2600 rent, most of the food cost so he can pay off debt. I will admit I feel like he can do better but with his bad upbringing and crappy family I tried to be gentle about nagging him and he hasn\u2019t made any areas of improvement. I\u2019ve worked hard to get new jobs and increase my salary and he hasn\u2019t which hurts because I work a lot 9-11h a day while it seems like he gets to follow his passion. He teaches kids gymnastics which doesn\u2019t pay well. Im an engineer and it feels like Im doing all the work keeping us afloat.\n\nSo when he got the money, I said we should buy an apartment or use it to pay off his debt or save it or something. But he wants to donate it and Im really hurt because he doesn\u2019t care that by doing that Im forced to keep working harder and harder to support us. Especially because our rent got (legally) increased to $2900 and so if we resign for the place almost half off my money is going to rent.

He says because I make more I should be paying what I do but he got a lot of money so why doesn\u2019t he pay for more things?

From a chunk that big?? Yo Im at a loss \ud83d\ude2c", "You are just trying to stay afloat.   You aren\u2019t trying to use the money to buy luxury cars and jet set around the world on crazy vacations.   He doesn\u2019t care because he is living well above his own means on your hard work.", "Don't feel bad, probably you are used to this type of life and the routine you are in. Break up with him it might be hard but as soon you are free you can finally live your life and take care of yourself. Also you won't be needing to be working so much, and finally have some free time", "I'm wondering if he is just thinking, \"Oh, well, OP doesn't mind picking up those bills, so it doesn't matter. OP is earning plenty, it's no hassle for OP.\"\n\nBecause otherwise I just can't wrap my head around this.\n\nEven given that, I can't wrap my head around this.  By all means, head for the hills.  It sounds like you'll be better off on your own.", "He lives the life he does because you pay for everything. He was given a way to pay off debt and invest in your future as a couple and he pissed that up the wall. Its easy to he generous when someone else is paying your bills.\n\nYou wanted him to use the money from his abusive brothers death to help finance a better future for him, and by extension you. You've paid his bills for so long. He's not going to suddenly get a six figure job and be able to replace the future you as a couple just lost because of his poorly thought out ideals. He made a unilateral decision, time for him to be an adult and face the consequences of that decision.\n\nThere is no coming back from what he's done, don't let him suck more out of you.", "DUMP HIM. Yesterday!", "NTA. He decided not to use this money to help himself and therefore you end up with a bigger burden yet again. You two have different goals in life and it sounds like you\u2019re no longer compatible. Find someone who is on the same page as you in regards to spending/saving. Or at least is working out of the same book.", "Then you need to rephrase it. You aren't asking him to use the money from his abusive brother's death. You're asking him to contribute a fairer amount to your living costs and expenses. How he chooses to do that is up to him. If he didn't want to use the insurance money - fine. He has the option of getting another job, working more hours, working 2 jobs. This isn't about the insurance money or where the money comes from - its the fact that he's relying on you to fund his lifestyle and offers nothing in return. \n\nNTA in this situation but Y T A to yourself if you continue to be in such a one sided relationship.", "Sometimes it\u2019s better to look at those time of things as the universe/god stepping in to help. Every time I\u2019ve been in a tight spot some thing happens money or otherwise that helps me out of it. Regardless of the reason I look at it as a gift. I.e., one night we had nothing in the house to eat and didn\u2019t have any money, the next day was payday. Right as my husband and we\u2019re talking about what to do our doorbell rang. It was a Nielsen rating guy and he paid for pizza delivery and we set up our house to be a Nielsen household. I learned generous to others and the world when I can, on the other side when others and the world are generous to you be receive with gratitude. \n\nThe world gave him a gift to help you when you really needed it and he tossed it and continues his self victimization. \n\nAs noble as the cancer charity is that amount of money is far more impactful for you guys and could have set you up to be far more generous in the future.", "Start tallying up every expense you have contributed since being with him and taking the financial load. Shove it in his face and then walk away.", "Your bf sounds like he should have used that \"blood money\" on some trauma therapy.", "You deserve each other, you are fighting logic with \" it sounds bad \"  and he is using dumb logic to justify being in debt and having a higher moral ground.", "He was tossed a life ring and he slapped it away. Save yourself he doesn't want to save himself.", "The fact that he received this inheritance and why is completely irrelevant to the issues you actually have in the relationship. \n\nYou\u2019re subsidizing someone else\u2019s lifestyle that radically differs from your expectations. \n\nThe inheritance and it\u2019s use made you *aware* of your unhappiness but it did not *cause* it.", "Honey, he sees himself as a Good Guy Who Does Good Things, and by staying with him and subsidizing him in a level of philanthropy that he cannot afford, and a job that doesn't allow him to support himself without your income, you're enabling his refusal to grow up and become self sufficient and financially responsible. \n\nYou need to end this. He's using you to maintain a self-image that isn't financially realistic, and this amounts to the financial abuse of you. This is not a healthy relationship for either of you. And you seem to know it already. So end things with him, and either he learns to stand on his own or he doesn't. But you need to look after yourself. NTA.", "He's a Todd, dump him\n\nWhy would he need life changing money when you pay for everything already?", "OP it ultimately doesn't matter where the money came from. The outcome is what matters. Him putting his wants above your needs. \nNTA", "Okay...  you are not dumping him because he wouldn't share his brother's money.\n\nYou are dumping him because -\nA) he made a major life decision and hid it from you until you found out from finding the receipt (which demonstrates a huge lack of communication and respect for you, he should have been able to tell you when he made the decision)\n\nB) you express to him you are stressed about money and he doesn't care to try to solve that WITH you (moving to a cheaper apartment, digging into both your budgets to prioritize how you're spending money and ease your stress)\n\nC) he has unresolved family issues that he doesn't appear to be getting any help with and are significantly impacting your life\n\nHe is not acting like a PARTNER, he doesn't care that you are being pushed past your point of comfort, financially, and he doesn't think you deserve to be told important things.\n\nI hate the phrase, but at this point he's quiet quitting your relationship and you haven't realized it yet.", "That sounds like he tried to hide that he had actually done it! \n\nNTA he has shown you who he is so believe him and run.", "Oh, dear. A tax receipt for donating more than he actually earns, which means he's not going to get nearly as big a charitable deduction as he'd have gotten if he'd donated over a period of years. NTA, but please free yourself from this guy who's savior complex has turned him into a financial idiot.", "But that money is gone and they can\u2019t get it back, it\u2019s donated, so what\u2019s the point in asking for it now? You can\u2019t get blood from a stone. The insurance money is gone and they\u2019re back to their respective salaries so asking him for more when he hasn\u2019t got it is an exercise in futility. That makes it a petty request. \n\nThat said, she\u2019s also 100% in the right if she\u2019s tired of the bullshit and wants to end the relationship over his decision to spend the money this way, plus all of the other history. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s a good fit for her or has much potential to build a life together with her. So instead of asking him to pay something she knows he can\u2019t pay, she should probably just cut her losses and go. She\u2019s NTA either way.", "yep, he\u2019s already an asshole, but that\u2019s the completely asinine, stand alone assholish move. \n  please don\u2019t buy a house with or marry this leech.", "That\u2019s what infuriated me more than anything else.\n\nHe could have paid off his debts???!? And he just gave it away???  Damn\u2026 at least get out from under the debt first.", "This. Real easy to have morals when it doesn\u2019t require any personal sacrifice.", "And my axe!", "He is the type to do this. He\u2019s donated money in the past while not in the best shape. He also lent money to friends/family who never paid it back.", "The deduction will carry forward just FYI. Not that it's a good decision either way.", "Ah, I see. So he lives like his luxuries are his and earned, while really he is simply putting his name on your money. \n\nSis this is messed up. Your family is right, time to leave. \n\nThis should absolutely be the last straw."]}
