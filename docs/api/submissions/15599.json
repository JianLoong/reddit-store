I make ~90k a year and he makes 35k. He also has cc debt from not making enough to survive on and medical debt. I pay $2000 of our $2600 rent, most of the food cost so he can pay off debt. I will admit I feel like he can do better but with his bad upbringing and crappy family I tried to be gentle about nagging him and he hasn\u2019t made any areas of improvement. I\u2019ve worked hard to get new jobs and increase my salary and he hasn\u2019t which hurts because I work a lot 9-11h a day while it seems like he gets to follow his passion. He teaches kids gymnastics which doesn\u2019t pay well. Im an engineer and it feels like Im doing all the work keeping us afloat.\n\nSo when he got the money, I said we should buy an apartment or use it to pay off his debt or save it or something. But he wants to donate it and Im really hurt because he doesn\u2019t care that by doing that Im forced to keep working harder and harder to support us. Especially because our rent got (legally) increased to $2900 and so if we resign for the place almost half off my money is going to rent.

He says because I make more I should be paying what I do but he got a lot of money so why doesn\u2019t he pay for more things?

Your friends and family will back you up \n\nI know because I have been there, with a guy who brought very little to the table. Took me months to tell him it was really over and we were done. And friends/family essentially sad, \"Good! Long overdue!\"", "First, are you sure he actually donated that? Bc he could be facing some serious problems when tax time comes.\n\nLeave him. He clearly cannot make good choices and isn't a partner.", "WTF is wrong with him? YTA, OP, but only to yourself because you are with this bum.", "NTA\n\nHe's shown you who he is. He'd rather feel like a savior to strangers than be a partner with you.\n\nThis won't change. You have actual proof now that he won't step up if he has the ability to do so.", "Wtf Queen, LEAVE HIM. This relationship is so done it\u2019s hard to believe it even started. You\u2019re not even a person here but a doormat and condolences for his loss, but he\u2019s costing you a lot more- not even financially but in your whole life! Ugh, wtf break up and get your life, dignity, capability, love, attention, support and security back!!!", "NTA, you were being used for a while now.", "Your boyfriend has got no incentive to keep the insurance money, he thinks he can scrounge off you for the rest of his life.", "nta - easy to be charitable when you aren\u2019t doing the work for it. Also your bf sounds so manipulative and lacks any sense of self-awareness. I would have started seeing red if someone said \u201cyou only see money\u201d comment to me if I was hustling to put a roof over their head and food on the table. Your bf sounds dumb and ungrateful. Dump that scrub", "NTA dump this loser", "NTA. That\u2019s not \u201cblood money\u201d - it\u2019s not like his brother was murdered and someone took money to look the other way. I\u2019m sure he has excuses why he hasn\u2019t gotten a better job, etc - but it sounds like as long as he can mooch off you he\u2019s in no hurry to pay off his debts (they\u2019re a good excuse not to contribute more I guess) just as he\u2019s not in a hurry to get a better-paying job (which might entail more work).", "He should have paid his fair share of the rent for the whole lease with that settlement at the minimum. Yikes. Run....", "NTA. it seems he was thinking of that money as \"dirty\" money instead of being reparations for the abuse he lived through from his brother. It sucks but you have to love yourself enough to know you might be better off without him.", "Why are you with him?", "NTA. You made good suggestions of what to do with the money, and he ignored it. Personally I would sign a new place without him until he can pull his own weight", "NTA you should break up with him today.", "You have permission to dump this leech. He doesn\u2019t care about to you or your sacrifices. This isn\u2019t a partner. NTA", "It\u2019s blood\nMoney to him.", "NTA. Time to stop subsidizing this selfish man. He can pay his share or live elsewhere. Personally, if I'd been working my butt off and paying most of the bills, and my SO did that to me, I'd show him the door and change the locks.", "NTA, leave him hes going nowhere and bleeding you dry. The fact he donated it all and didn't pay off any of his debts while you subsidize his life is insane and it's even crazier that he feels entitled enough to your mo ey to argue the point. This dude is out here acting like you saw dollar signs and are suddenly so greedy meanwhile he can't even afford to feed himself, you have a dependent not a partner its time to free yourself of what has clearly become a burden and move on.", "Maybe that is what I\u2019m looking for. All my friends say to do it but when I think about that I want him to use the money from his abusive brother\u2019s death it sounds bad. But then I think about all the money I\u2019ve spent because he doesn\u2019t make an effort and when the money falls into his lap he still doesn\u2019t make an effort it\u2019s hard to justify his actions", "Seconded. Permission granted from here, as well. Time to go! Once he's no longer being taken care of he'll see that money differently.", "Its crazy to me that he wouldn't want to use the \"blood\" money as a big \"f you\" to his brother. You died at 29 and I bought a house and got ahead in life so eff your abuse. \n\n\nIdk I guess but nta", "This!! It's more noble to work hard then mooch off others.", "THIS\n\nHe definitively had a shot to show you he cared and what matters to him and it was not you. Don\u2019t do this to yourself, leave him.", "I found the tax receipt he got from donating", "He is taking advantage of you and you are letting him.  Why should he bother getting a better job when you pay for his lifestyle?  He is not going to change.  Which means that your situation won't change unless you make it happen.", "He didn\u2019t even pay off his *own* debt, thereby saddling you with most of the bills longer. This is him using you 100%.", "NTA You are basically drowning while trying to swim for two and he donated enough money to buy a small yacht.\n\nHe did not have to put all of that money in one place. He could have donated some, paid off his debt, used some for a down payment for a home, and gotten therapy that he clearly needs. He could have at least taken you out for a nice meal. He is an adult who can not only see for himself that you are overwhelmed and headed towards burnout, but you have told him so. And the longer you put this off, the worse off you are financially and mentally.\n\nBut you've been taking care of this man for years and it's hard to stop feeling like you're responsible for someone. So I'll put forth this argument: ditch him now and he can run to his mum who still hopefully has some of her half left to buy him time to figure things out. The longer you wait, the more likely her half will be gone too.", "He has a clear case of \u2018what\u2019s mine is mine; and what\u2019s yours is also mine\u2019. \n\nHe feels entitled to your money and effort without making sure you are supported by his.", "It really does not sound that bad, he has made you believe his negative narrative regarding this $. It was not \u201cblood money\u201d", "Up until now you could make excuses that he wasn't contributing because of his job, that he meant well he just didn't have the money to help. You could wrap yourself in knots justifying why he is the way he is. This insurance money is like taking off blinders. You can't convince yourself anymore that if he had money he would help. You can't tell yourself the lies you have to tell yourself to stay anymore.", "It's easy for him to sit on his high horse and feel like a saint for declining his brother's \"blood\" money while you're working your ass off to support him. Let him get a taste of the real world, where he has to support himself. \n\nHe showed you that he's always going to prioritize his weird principles (seriously, who even thinks of insurance as \"blood money\"?) over your wellbeing.", "He literally could have made your life easier and he chose not to", "Even if he wasn't a bum and a bad partner, you still have every right to leave a relationship if you are not happy in said relationship.", "He is using you, he doesn\u2019t prioritize you or your needs, and he clearly has no intention of ever changing. \n\nNTA - and I also encourage you to determine if you should stay, or even if you want to stay.", "Listen it\u2019s great he teaches kids and wants to donate the money. BUT it seems like he\u2019s very focused on himself and what he wants and what brings him happiness. I don\u2019t think you fit into that at all for him and you\u2019re his safety net so he can live however he wants while not worrying about money. You can\u2019t justify the actions of someone who cares only about themself and doing what they want. If he loves you, he would\u2019ve kept at least half to lessen the burden and contribute. Do you really want to be his bank/ATM while he figures out his life and what makes him happy while he actively watches you struggle? I think that\u2019s the real question", "NTA. Seriously. If you need additional permission to dump him, you have mine too. Make like a Smurf with the dam breaking and run as fast as your little blue legs will carry you. You don\u2019t have a partner, you have an anchor and he will drag you down.", "The complicated relationship with his brother is one thing. There's always gonna be stuff people need to unpack in their own way. BUT, his behaviour afterwards shows his true character. \nIf he's grown enough to make big financial decisions for himself, then you are equally grown and able to do the same for yourself, but he takes umbrage with it because he sees his safety net that allows him to act how he wants disappearing.\n\nYou're too good to him for what he brings to your partnership. And it is supposed to be a partnership. He's already got a mother, you don't need to play the role out of a misplaced sense of loyalty. \nThe paying his way is one thing, but he doesn't sound particularly pleasant to be around either if he doesn't get his way.\nThere's too many other people out there to waste your time trying to make this one be the partner that you need him to be, when he very clearly doesn't want to put in the work to be that person for you.", "And he doesnt care enough to help you when be can.", "Yeah, at the very least, he should pay off his existing debts.", "He didn\u2019t ?!?!?\n\nThats one hell of a daft move"]}
