I make ~90k a year and he makes 35k. He also has cc debt from not making enough to survive on and medical debt. I pay $2000 of our $2600 rent, most of the food cost so he can pay off debt. I will admit I feel like he can do better but with his bad upbringing and crappy family I tried to be gentle about nagging him and he hasn\u2019t made any areas of improvement. I\u2019ve worked hard to get new jobs and increase my salary and he hasn\u2019t which hurts because I work a lot 9-11h a day while it seems like he gets to follow his passion. He teaches kids gymnastics which doesn\u2019t pay well. Im an engineer and it feels like Im doing all the work keeping us afloat.\n\nSo when he got the money, I said we should buy an apartment or use it to pay off his debt or save it or something. But he wants to donate it and Im really hurt because he doesn\u2019t care that by doing that Im forced to keep working harder and harder to support us. Especially because our rent got (legally) increased to $2900 and so if we resign for the place almost half off my money is going to rent.

He says because I make more I should be paying what I do but he got a lot of money so why doesn\u2019t he pay for more things?

He should have first paid off his debt, then put a few thousand in savings, and started paying more toward home expenses since he no longer has to pay off debt. Then he could still have donated some money to charity. Giving all if it while you're struggling isn't fair to you.", "He's not ready, willing or able to invest in your life together. You don't need more proof than this.\n\nLeave.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He forgot he's the charity case. He should donate it to the charity organisation named OP.", "NTA. This is not the relationship for you. He has shown you EXACTLY what he will do with your combined finances if you marry. \n\nGiving money to charity is wonderful...if you have the money to give away. He does not. His unwillingness to address the reality of his situation (debts. can't cover basic expenses.) when presented with a lifeline (the insurance money) means he is going to be a financial anchor around your neck. You will not change him.", "ESH. Having recently gotten an inheritance from someone I had a difficult relationship with, I have empathy for his response to what he considers blood money, and I completely understand wanting to donate it. That said, I also see the reality of financial obligations, and agree that ideally the bf could've used some of the money for themselves/their relationship.\n\nHowever, OP doesn't do themselves any favors with how they describe the relationship. OP doesn't seem to have anything positive to say about their bf, and only seems to resent him for being able to \"follow his passion\", whereas OP has a chip on their shoulder since they work 9-11h/day. Obviously, OP can choose whatever job/career they want, but if it's important to OP that their bf has a similar approach to work, then that's something OP should consider when choosing a partner.\n\nFrom the post, I imagine OP didn't really give their bf many options on how to use the insurance/blood money, likely pushing specific uses (buying an apartment, paying debt, etc.). Given the bf's response and calling it \"blood money\", had I been in OP's place, I would have tried to encourage them to set it aside into an account while going to therapy, and ignore said account (other than taxes, etc.) for a year or two. Yes, debt will continue to accrue interest, and rent will keep rising, but by forcing the issue, OP may have inadvertently pushed the bf to doing a big donation, rather than bf having time to process it. I know the post said the brother died 1 year ago, and the insurance money came through 6 months ago, but depending on whether the bf is in therapy and how abusive/complicated the relationship is, that's not necessarily enough time to heal.\n\nOverall, this just sounds like an unhealthy relationship, especially with how OP is approaching it.", "This. Save yourself. He\u2019s sure doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s going to try and help himself, just continue to take and take from you, until you have nothing left to be taken.", "This comment made me laugh \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA OP, and now strangers on the internet think he's a bum and ask why you're with him!", "NTA - and I agree with all this.", "OP should name the (ex) St. Bum....honored and granted...", "This. OP, you're upset because he finally had a chance to give back to you and make your lives easier, and he didn't. Dump him. Let him deal with the consequences of his bad decisions.", "To add..when he said OP should pay because she earn more... that's the motivation he need to not upgrade his life cause if he find better job that pay more, surely he need to pay more..", "Pick you. Choose you. Love you.", "There are no justifications for his actions. Every penny you spend on him should physically hurt you at this point. This is the biggest narcissistic act of douchery I've ever heard of.", "Hey OP, I\u2019m not sure if anyone asked this, but did he even offer you any amount of that settlement before he gave it away???", "It\u2019s seems like this money is just the breaking point. He has been taking advantage of you for a long time. Wanting to donate the money would be different if he wasn\u2019t mooching off you.", "He doesn\u2019t even have interest in reciprocating what you have done for him. He just wants to give it away instead of thinking of how it could improve both of your lives. He\u2019s so selfish", "The thing is, he's not just using the money from his brother to donate.\n\nHe's using your money.\n\nHe couldn't afford to donate the money if you weren't covering most of the expenses. \n\nHe decided that donations to charity are more important than treating you fairly.", "I know the insurance money was the trigger here, but honestly, I don't think this is about the insurance money. You sound like you have been frustrated with this mis-match in incomes for a while now. And at his lack of \"ambition\" - he sounds like he is happy with what he does and doesn't want a better paying job. \n\nIt's about him not pulling his weight in the relationship - at least financially. You and he are clearly not seeing eye to eye about your day to day finances, your financial goals and future, or the path to get where you want to go. Those are the things you need to sort out, and if you can't, those are the things that will lead to you breaking up. \n\nThe insurance money is just throwing that into stark relief as you are looking for ways to reach some financial stability and hit some goals like paying off debt or buying your own home and he is not. \n\nI can understand his position too. He wants to use that money for good - to help those dealing with terrible situations. He may be feeling grief, and guilt, and a whole gamut of emotions alongside. This may be how he's working through it.\n\nI think this is above my paygrade to judge because I think you and he have a whole lot of deep conversation about the future, where you are going, what you want out of life and so on. You'll find you are either compatible or not, whether is is \"mooching\" off you or not, and ultimately make that decision.", "He could've donated it  to you. Honestly he sounds like a bum, not earning enough is one thing but he doesn't sound like a team player at all.", "This was infuriating to read. He is entitled and using you. Let\u2019s say he is a bit misguided and idealistic, but even that does not excuse not paying his debt first (at least). OP, you are NTA and I understand you invested (literally) so much in this relationship, but imagine how your life would be with an equal partner in the sense of equal energy invested and responsibility toward your shared life.", "Don\u2019t throw good money after bad. \n\nIt\u2019s the sunk cost fallacy. We tend to continue with someone because we invested time or money or effort. It\u2019s not relevant for your decision to break up or not. It\u2019s in the past. You have to think about what it will cost you in the future to continue this relationship.", "It\u2019s still not petty. Obviously he has money to spare in his day to day life if he didn\u2019t think he needed that 130,000. Or obviously he\u2019s comfortable having her take care of him. In which both cases I also would have said \u201cokay, I\u2019m done doing that, you pay your fair share.\u201d That\u2019s just a direct consequence of his behaviour. It doesn\u2019t matter whether he is a stone or not, it\u2019s about the principal and what someone is willing to allow.", "It's quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever read on this sub, and that's saying a lot.", "He seems to like getting credit but being irresponsible, I think honestly at this point break up with him. He\u2019s probably addicted to the feeling of charity that gives him, not for the actual good. How can he love you when he sees you struggling when you have clearly told him how much it takes to support you guys. I don\u2019t come from money but I\u2019m in a good place now so I splurge more but I\u2019m very aware of my financial state. Giving away that amount of money is ridiculous when he\u2019s poor af. He\u2019s clearly taking advantage of you, and he needs a hard fall to realize or not how much he needs to work on himself first."]}
