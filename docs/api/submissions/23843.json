Even if it were true that he doesn't have anything else in his life, *you are not a \"thing\" to be bartered and traded to make him happy*.\n\nJust because his position is bad, doesn't mean you have to do what he wants. Just because he wants a relationship, doesn't mean he'll get it. Just because he is sick, doesn't mean anyone owes him anything, especially you. You are a *person*, you have *autonomy*, you are old enough to make your own choices on a relationship.\n\nThere is a word for people who coerce or force people into a relationship (normally sexual) with someone else. They're called *traffickers*. As in human trafficking. If your mother is trying to coerce you into a sexual relationship with your friend, if you feel like your mother is trying to force you to have a relationship with this boy, she *may* be committing a crime.\n\nHere's the most uncomfortable part: you're part of a demented game of telephone. You have no idea what your friend said to his mother, you have no idea what his mother said to your mother, and you have no way of knowing for sure. Maybe he just said \"I really like her and one day I'd like to marry her\" and his mother went to yours to convince her to make you make her son happy. Maybe his mother just told yours and your mother's built up some silly plan to make you get together. But maybe your friend went to his mother and said \"I'm in love with my friend. Can you make her date me?\" And they've run with it. The problem is that unless you have 100% proof of what your friend said, you cannot trust anything said now. Because they all have reason to lie, or to gaslight you into thinking you're unreasonable. \n\nSo you, for your own safety, need to stop seeing/talking to your friend so much. It sucks, a lot. You could simply say that your parents behaviour around your friendship is making you uncomfortable and you'd like some distance until things calm down. Or you could say that you're being forced to do something you don't want and if he's okay with that then he isn't a good friend. But you need that space.", "NTA. Some guy having feelings for you doesnt obligate you to anything.  His cancer is irrelevent to this situation.  Your mom is the AH.\n.", "Your mom should not be pressuring you into a relationship you aren't comfortable with, no matter the circumstances. She may mean well, but her job is to support YOU in making decisions that YOU feel good about. \n\nYou sound like a really thoughtful person and I'm sure you'll express your feelings to him in a kind way. However, it doesn't even sound like he has directly confessed to you. Good for you for standing your ground. NTA, and best wishes to your friend.", "NTA\n\nPoor lad already has enough problems in his life without adding a false relationship into the mix.\n\nIf you don't want to go beyond being friends then you should not have to.  It's not fair on you to try to force you to do it and your mum shouldn't be doing that.  \n\nYou are already doing a lot for him by being there for him as a friend and he is lucky to have you.", "NTA.\n\nYou have every right to feel attracted to or unattracted to whomever you want to.\n\nGoing into a relationship because of pity is wrong, and a lie to yourself as well as your friend.", "NTA this should\u2019ve been a private convo between the two of you. Your mom is wrong for pressuring you", "Good lord, what is your mother thinking? NTA Does she want you to offer a consolation shag as well? Sorry, this has me a little upset. I think you should tell him what the moms have been discussing and let him know that you are not in that head space right now. Let him know how much you value his friendship. Truly, who knows what the future holds, but you are only 14. \nMy son had a friend who had cancer. She loved him. They were only 12. Her life was filled with cancer with only 4 years of remission in between. She passed at 13. He spent as much time as possible with her, and they had a great relationship. She needed to believe that her future held true love. To be able to hope for a forever kind of future, which is probably why your mom thinks you are selfish, because your friend wants to focus on a forever kind of future. Your mom might also know how short or long his life will be and is not sharing that with you. Not that his life expectancy should sway your opinion. Enjoy where you are now with him. He might just have said what he did to get his mom off his back. (She might be the one who needs to see this as part of his future.) Who knows. Be honest, and if he needs some space afterward to absorb where you are coming from or to stop feeling embarrassed, do not feel guilty. Honesty and truth are always the best.", "WOW\nYour mom is PUSHING you into dating someone at 14????\n\nYour mom needs psychiatric help and potentially take you from her for a more stable household \n\nNTA", "NTA. You've done nothing wrong, but it's wrong of both the Moms to pressure you into a relationship you don't want or aren't comfortable with.\n\nJust be honest with your friend about how you feel.", "NTA, your mom doesn\u2019t decide who you should date. Be a good friend and be supportive.", "So your parents think the best thing for him would be a girl who doesn't even wanna be with him? A one-sided relationship? \n\nIf you wanna help bro out maybe help him find his own date.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you are 14, and he\u2019s 15. Was he given a timeline for how long he has left to live? That\u2019s the only thing that I can come up with for a 15 year old to be talking to their mother about the rest of their lives like that. I could be biased though because when I was 15 I had a boyfriend that we had those discussions. He would talk about the rest of our lives together a lot, but then he died. Regardless, you are NTA, and your mom shouldn\u2019t be pushing you. Stand your ground or it will happen your whole life when it comes to relationships.", "NTA  Never be with someone for any reason other than that's the one you want to be with. Neither will enjoy it. Your mom is an AH  for sexually exploiting her own daughter. \n\nIf they want him to have that experience they can buy him a prostitute.", "NTA \n\nI mean I get that it\u2019s tough and I\u2019m only able to say this rationally as I\u2019m not involved but your mother is trying to guilt trip u into getting into a commitment that you are not ready for", "NTA \n\nWhile it sucks that he has cancer it still does not give him a pass on asking for consent", "NTA - it'd be horrible to just stay with him out of pity because he \"doesn't have anything\". Horrible for both of you.", "NTA\n\nI feel like getting together with him out of pity would only hurt both of you, and even if that wasn't the case, God, setting up two kids together is so creepy. It's okay just to be his friend, and if he doesn't want that, then it's his loss, his illness has nothing to do with that. You should never be forced into something you don't want/aren't ready for, and it's good that you're standing up for yourself. I wish you well.", "What did I just read???? Oh my God! You\u2019re NTA op but your mother is.", "The road to hell is paved in good intentions... and if really were the oone he eould be your one too.    \nIt is difficult, but you must be honest to yourself too and listen to your own heart. Instead of saying no, however, I would repeat what you said: you are not ready for anyone yet.", "NTA \nA one sided relationship would be wrong for all concerned. You should never enter into something like that likely. It was awful of your mom to guilt you or pressure you about something as important as a relationship.", "NTA your mum is though wth is her problem trying to force you into a relationship just because he has cancer is wrong your mum is disgusting", "NTA you're friends and he should accept that.", "NTA. Nobody should tell you who to be with. It is absolutely fine to refuse, and keep refusing, no matter how angry or sad your mother is.", "NTA. Its not ok to get into a relationship out of anything other than attraction. If you arent attracted to him then you should stay friends. Its extremely unfair of your mother to push you. Do you know what his mother thinks about it? I can bet you she would be on your side. My own sister 'dated' someone with a degenerative disease but wasnt really into it but felt bad ending it until I told her what I just said and they accepted it and they are still friends to this day. If he ever found out you dated him out of pity or shame for saying no he would likely be hurt so its better to just stay friends.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren\u2019t interested in him like that. Life happens that way and people learn to deal with disappointment.", "You never, ever have to be with anyone unless it's what you want. Your mom is incorrect on this one. You don't force yourself to be with someone just because you feel bad. It's not fair on you or him. This is true regardless of him having cancer. You can be kind to him and let him down gently but it will be infinitely worse in the long run to pretend to have feelings. He also needs to learn that just because he wants something to happen doesn't make it happen.", "Definitely NTA, while what he's going through is incredibly sad it still doesn't change the fact that you can't just create feelings for someone. If your feelings for him don't go beyond friendship then there isn't anything or anybody that can change that including your mother. Your mom is very wrong to try and pressure you into any relationship, especially at only 14 years old. I hope you will try to continue being a great friend to him if possible because he probably needs support desperately but please don't allow your mom or anyone else ever pressure you into a relationship that you don't want. Adults don't always get it right and that's why you have so many of us here telling you that your mom is dead wrong on this. She's not looking out for your feelings, thoughts, and well being first and foremost and that should be the top priority for any parent.", "NTA and your mom is a huge AH, in regards for both of you. You have absolutely every right to reject him. Nobody is entitled to be with. \n\nHim, on the other hand, have the right/responsibility to process those feelings on his own and then communicate them to in in a respectful manner, on his own terms,then deal with the rejection. \n\nYour mom robbed him of the agency of deciding how to deal with those feelings, and how and when communicating them. \nAnd tried to rob your of your agency to decide who you want to be with. Both is disgusting.", "NTA- it is so immoral to just date someone just due to a factor like this. You did the right thing by declining because you were being honest.", "NTA. Your mum shouldn't be setting you up or forcing you to date anyone. It's nice he has a crush on you and all, but I'm on your side. You need to focus on what is important to you and not be in a relationship with someone who sees you as their future wife. You guys are still so young!!", "This is very difficult. The parents want you to be his experience before he dies. Could be his health is getting worse. There won\u2019t be anyone else. He\u2019ll die a virgin. \n\nIf you can\u2019t find it within yourself to be attracted to him in that way, stay close to him, and hold his hand.
