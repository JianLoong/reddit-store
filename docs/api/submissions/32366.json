Every other year, I returned before him to spend Christmas day with my family. This year is the first time in a long time that all the other siblings are able to overlap dates.  My fiance has major FOMO, which is why this is a sensitive subject. His parents have always been weird about keeping their family close. They've never said it outright but little things suggest they don't consider me completely part of their family yet since we aren't married.\n\nAlso, my parents are away overseas dealing with a grandparent emergency. My mom has been kept in the loop though and is trying to come back as soon as she can.**\n\nMy fiance and I (31M and 31F) are expecting our first baby due December 30th. His family has a vacation home in Florida and they have gone every year during the holidays for about a month until after New Year. He agreed not to go this year because of the baby but his family is insisting that he go and come back on the 28th which is \"ample time before the baby is due\". So he bought a ticket for December 15th-28th. His reasoning is that his parents really want him there and his siblings will also be going.\n\nThis is bothering me alot more than I thought because I know pregnancies are unpredictable, especially in the last trimester and if anything happens leading up to the due date, I need him there. My parents are away until December 26th and my friends have their families so I will be completely alone. The other reason...and I guess it's more selfish, is that I will be spending Christmas by myself. It's not the main reason why I'm bothered but it's a small part of it. He's been spending Christmas every year in Florida since he was 15 and there will be many more trips after the baby is born. I don't know why he has to go THIS YEAR.\n\nAny time I bring it up, it results in a very uncomfortable fight about my expectations to put me first rather than his parents. I don't even bring it up anymore. His parents have always been kind to me but they also don't see any problem so I think I'm going crazy?

He is only focussed on his experience and not your comfort.\n\nLeaving you alone for Christmas even without being pregnant or near birth is not the actions of someone ready to get married and make you and baby his priority as his nuclear family.\n\nLeaving you for 2 weeks while heavily pregnant even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas or quite so close to delivery shows he either doesn\u2019t get or care about the impact on pregnancy on you. There are so many things you cannot do for yourself and so many things that can go wrong.\n\nAdd all 3 together and this is relationship ending level. Actually any one on their own would be enough.

The fact that his mother is insisting, knowing that not only will you will be spending Xmas by yourself, but that you will be pregnant and by yourself so close to your due date does not sit well.

So you need to make additional preparations: you better have someone else to accompany /support you during childbirth in case it happens before the 28th.

You and his unborn child should be his #1 priority and he seems oblivious to this (I\u2019m being kind here).

Sometimes there's an urgent need and you prioritize based on that. \n\nBig issue one, to me, is his parents,  who have multiple children,  are acting like a due date is an appointment,  not a best guess. And fiance is just going along with it, when he should have been looking up pregnancy information and preparing to be a father.\n\nIf op goes into labor while he's gone, he's going to miss the birth of child.", "Unless she\u2019s not a soon to be wife and the ring came with a silent shut up note attached", "And give the kid your current last name!", "My angle was to slow down the father and his family from trying to get custody. I also see your point too.   \nI don't think she's in any fit state now to up sticks and run for the hills. It's what the 'father' deserves. He's a jerk!", "I would absolutely be gobsmacked if a family member whose partner was just about to give birth abandoned said partner for a holiday he goes on every single year. I would never let him live that down.", "I actually love the thought of a bunch of Redditors (who have nowhere else to go) just showing up at the OP's house to hang out with her for Christmas, pamper her like crazy, and bring along toys for the baby.  Preferably a divorce lawyer among them, but I'm not fussy.", "This is one of those ones where I know I wouldn't do it, but I would have dreams of posting this thread all over social media and send emails out to everybody I know with \"Why I left the father of my unborn baby\" as the subject.", "She should call her fiance's boss and ask if she can come over and explain why", "That is what gets me too, how much the parents are assholes because they know how birthing a baby works. So selfish really, I guess I can see where the fianc\u00e9 gets his attitude from.", "Exactly! I mean\u2026does OP really want to marry into a family that are all ok with him abandoning her as she\u2019s in the verge of giving birth?? That\u2019s what I\u2019d be asking myself.", "Three people in extra fancy headgear turning up together. One with a huge stock of delicious food for her freezer, one with an assistant to help keep her home clean and one with a huge cheque for the baby's future. \n\n<3", "same here!\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3c", "Love this! I like cleaning for fun so I\u2019d definitely do this if OP is in Georgia", "If she's in Or, I can stop by :)", ">Preferably a divorce lawyer among them, but I'm not fussy\n\nGood thing is, they're not married yet!  But I would seriously be thinking of not marrying him.", "\"OP, we're so happy you can join us for Christmas but where is Fianc\u00e9?\" \"Oh, he's spending 2 weeks in Florida with his family and coming back 2 days before my due date. I asked him not to go, but he really wanted to spend Christmas with his family instead.\" How to stop a party in its tracks \ud83d\ude02", "100% this or even just why I\u2019m on my own at Christmas.", "Nah, she needs him to keep his job so he can pay child support.", "Why would his boss care?", "What about the myrrh?", "I like the reboot of the wise people", "I'm in Florida. I can go berate the fiance.", "That's the thing that really gets me though, your last line, he wants to spend time with his family... So she is not his family? Just an incubator or something? I have kids, they (my midwives and whatever) say your first is late I was just over a week early, like why the fuck is he leaving. \n\nNow is the time to start a new family tradition, one where he doesn't leave his partner and mother of his child alone on Xmas."]}
