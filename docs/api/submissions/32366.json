His family has a vacation home in Florida and they have gone every year during the holidays for about a month until after New Year. He agreed not to go this year because of the baby but his family is insisting that he go and come back on the 28th which is \"ample time before the baby is due\". So he bought a ticket for December 15th-28th. His reasoning is that his parents really want him there and his siblings will also be going.\n\nThis is bothering me alot more than I thought because I know pregnancies are unpredictable, especially in the last trimester and if anything happens leading up to the due date, I need him there. My parents are away until December 26th and my friends have their families so I will be completely alone. The other reason...and I guess it's more selfish, is that I will be spending Christmas by myself. It's not the main reason why I'm bothered but it's a small part of it. He's been spending Christmas every year in Florida since he was 15 and there will be many more trips after the baby is born. I don't know why he has to go THIS YEAR.\n\nAny time I bring it up, it results in a very uncomfortable fight about my expectations to put me first rather than his parents. I don't even bring it up anymore. His parents have always been kind to me but they also don't see any problem so I think I'm going crazy?

There are so many things you cannot do for yourself and so many things that can go wrong.\n\nAdd all 3 together and this is relationship ending level. Actually any one on their own would be enough.

The fact that his mother is insisting, knowing that not only will you will be spending Xmas by yourself, but that you will be pregnant and by yourself so close to your due date does not sit well.

So you need to make additional preparations: you better have someone else to accompany /support you during childbirth in case it happens before the 28th.

Your fianc\u00e9 will resent you if he stays. If the baby doesn't come? It's an \"I told you so\". His parents will think they're vindicated. There is no way you get what you need and aren't the bad guy, and that sucks because his selfishness is the problem.\n\nI don't like these \"leave/divorce\" type comments.

He should want to be 100% guaranteed that he will be able to be there to support you and see his child as soon as he/she is born. \n\nHe could very easily miss the whole thing, because, like you said, pregnancy and delivery of a baby is wildly unpredictable. You could easily go into labor in the middle of this vacation. Then he will have to try to find a flight with a seat at Christmastime, and by the time he has a flight, flies home, and gets to the hospital, your baby could be born.

You are no longer guaranteed to spend every holiday with them, because they are adults with their own lives that often wind up including spouses and children.
