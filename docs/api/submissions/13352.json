You declared this as tho he input didn\u2019t matter\u2014forcing her into an uncomfortable role of trying to appease you & defend her brother. That\u2019s shitty & manipulative. \n\n3: So you went looking at house but didn\u2019t decide how many bedrooms you would need beforehand? I agree the kids shouldn\u2019t have to share bedrooms. But it sounds like she was fine with that, or otherwise hadn\u2019t thought it through. Point is, did you even discuss how much room you would need? That\u2019s a different topic than how many kids you plan on having. This all happened because you were reacting out of frustration to the situation instead of being proactive about communicating with your wife about the issues. \n\n4: She also appears to be MIA when it comes to communicating  but this is about OP\u2019s role.\n\nAll that said, INFO requested: how did BIL come to live with you? When & why?", "NTA for wanting your own house with your family. It\u2019s insane your wife just expects this. \n\nYTA for just springing this on your wife like this.

But I have a question\u2026 why is the BIL living with them? Jobless? Disabled? Ill? The sister just wants him there? He\u2019s irresponsible with money? Scared to live alone? There\u2019s more to this. \u2026.. but I agree. Stop house hunting and get on** the same page with your wife. NTA for not wanting him to move with you.

Why would he want to live with a couple who is trying to have more kids? It was fair for OP to assume he would not be joining. Him and his wife clearly have opposite expectations and need to work on communicating. With that said - it makes more sense for him to assume BIL isn't coming", "Does he pay bills? Is he contributing? \nIs he priced out the of market in your area? Does he just not want strangers as roommates?", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think announcing it during the visit to the new house was the best time. It sounds like you, your wife, and BIL are not at all on the same page, and you definitely should be put in a position where you are forced to have him stay with you indefinitely.

You have a wife issue, not a BIL issue.", "While you're on the subject of unilateral decisions, ask your wife how she would feel if you got snipped without discussing it first", "Looking at your post history, your wife just sucks. This is just another example of how she doesn\u2019t value you.  Instead of looking at house, maybe look at marriage counselors?", "Fair, but you need to figure out where that line is. At what point is the situation a deal breaker? Are you going to figure out how to make things work no matter what? Are you going to resent them both if you give in? Are you going to continue looking at homes and/or planning for more children regardless of the BIL? Are you willing to continue the status quo, but not add to the situation by buying a new home and/or having more kids? You're both going to have to do some real soul searching here and make a plan on the future.", "And BIL didn\u2019t even think he needed a conversation with OP because why wouldn\u2019t his sister and her husband want him to continue living with them?", "That's my fault. I really should've said something", "Ooof I remember that one. BIL is a lazy asshole (since that\u2019s the only descriptive word allowed). This problem is much bigger than the many \u201csmall\u201d issues. \n\nNTA OP, but this IS the hill to die on."]}
