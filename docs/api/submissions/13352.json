Sure, you\u2019ve been with your wife for a long time (??) but how much of that has been good??", "Did you read that post? Sounds to me like he *was* bad in bed.", "You assume he's paying....", "Does your BIL at least contribute to the household. Pay rent, utilities etc", "This is where I think YTA. This needed to be one of the first things you talked about with your wife when you started looking for a new place to live. It's like you were waiting for the absolute worst time and place to start this conversation.", "Bingo. NTA for your feelings, but YTA perhaps you managed it. I would recommend you go back and first apologize to your wife for the way that you raised this issue. Perhaps you can explain that it\u2019s been bothering you for a long time and it just got the better of you, and you\u2019re sorry for not talking with her about it sooner. Then explain why you feel the way you feel.", "No that\u2019s not true. Unmarried siblings living with married siblings is very common, especially if the married sibling lives in closer proximity to good schools or jobs. Big intergenerational community near me and lots of siblings living with married siblings. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing unreasonable about siblings sharing rooms with their newborn siblings. First of all, newborns sleep with their parents\u2019 rooms in nearly all cases until they\u2019re like minimum 4 months old and typically much longer. Secondly, 99% of children in the world do not have their own room. I didn\u2019t have my own room until I was in my 20s and I came from a comfortable middle class family. So, if OP\u2019s wife\u2019s expectation is that her brother will live with her until he\u2019s more settled, it would be unfathomable to her to kick her brother out for the sake of giving a newborn its own bedroom, particularly when that newborn could easily stay with its parents until it\u2019s a year or older and not \u201cmove in\u201d with its sister until it sleeps better. \n\nThere is nothing unreasonable about their arrangement as it stands. The only issue here is that they\u2019re not on the same page about the arrangement and haven\u2019t communicated expectations.", "Yeah they can fit at least 1 more kid in their current house if BIL moved out- seems like that should have been something worth discussing before house hunting. Or at least they should have had a convo about how many bedrooms they were looking for before going to see houses. The lack of communication is wild.", "Heck they don\u2019t need a new house if wife\u2019s plan was to just stick the baby in her daughter\u2019s room (which is an awful idea by the way)", "BIL\u2019s attempt to pick which room he wants, when he\u2019s been living with his sister and her husband for less than a year, shows an entitled attitude. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s a full partner in their household.", "Man I'm sorry but I feel horrible for you. It seems as though you put up with a lot of unnecessary abuse. You need to start trusting your instincts.", "Or his sister had already told him he\u2019d be living in the new house. Clearly that\u2019s what she thought was understood. \n\nOP and his wife need to get on the same page.", "If you thought you were moving to a new house you\u2019d also want to express your feelings as to which room you\u2019d want. It would be entitled if he said he wanted that particular bedroom, the couple said no and he demanded that he get that particular bedroom anyway.", "I still consider it a leap to go from him living in the new house to him being entitled to pick which room he wants in the new house. Though maybe his sister told him he could do that; she seems to be planning for him to live with them permanently."]}
