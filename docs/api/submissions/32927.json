When I arrived, they were already at the house because they had slept there for the past few nights. I walked to the living room where we were going to open our gifts and found out they had put up the Christmas tree without me. I was upset about it, as this was a tradition my dad and I always did together after he and my mom broke up.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to ruin the day, so I brushed it off and tried not to mention it. When we finally opened the presents, it turned out we all (excluding parents) got the same gifts: a maze in a glass sphere, cubes that could transform, and a tiny Rubik\u2019s cube. The fianc\u00e9\u2019s middle child didn\u2019t bother too much and watched YouTube videos, while the rest of us were trying to figure out how the toys worked. The maze turned out to be broken for all of us, but the transforming cubes toy worked. Well, it worked for everyone but me, so all I was left with was a Rubik\u2019s cube. This may sound very rich, but I own 6 of these from normal-sized to tiny, and I wasn\u2019t planning on getting another one.\n\nI still tried getting the transforming cubes toy to work, but nothing I did changed anything. I looked slightly upset, and that caught the attention of my dad, who had been watching me to see whether I liked his gifts or not. I saw the look of disappointment in his eyes and knew we were going to have a talk after his fianc\u00e9 and kids left.\n\nSkip to the conversation. He was very mad that I wasn\u2019t excited about the gifts. He said, 'I know what I bought isn\u2019t spectacular, but you can at least appreciate that I bought something.' I told him that the only thing I could use was the Rubik\u2019s cube, while the others were able to create different shapes with the other toy. He called me ungrateful and said that he tried finding gifts just for me, so I should be happy that he thought about me. I told him about the Christmas tree and said that might be the reason I was more easily able to get upset over small things. He didn\u2019t accept that reason and said the kids were the ones who suggested it, not him, so I shouldn\u2019t blame him for it nor get upset over the tree.\n\nI left the conversation even more upset than I was before, not understanding why he didn\u2019t get my point. Now a week later, I feel pretty guilty. Maybe I overreacted and made it a bigger deal than it should\u2019ve been.

Let's be honest, do you really think he put that much effort into finding gifts if he just gave everybody the same thing?\n\nAlso, you told him honestly that you were disappointed that you didn't get to spend time *with him* putting up the tree and his response was to shift the blame to the other children? He could have just apologized and said that he didn't know it was that important to you and at least acknowledge your hurt or try to make it up to you in another way.\n\nNow just ask yourself if you were sullen and bitter or just disappointed? From the way you tell the story, it doesn't sound like you were complaining to anybody you just weren't that thrilled with the gifts and were feeling a little down already because of missing out on putting up the tree. If you think that you told your father in earnest how you were feeling without being accusatory or seeming ungrateful then it seems to me that your father is the asshole. He's either embarrassed at what a shit job he did for making everybody happy this Christmas and taking his shame out on you or he's just a jerk who expects to be told how great he is for the minimal effort he expended.", "NTA\n\n>He called me ungrateful and said that he tried finding gifts just for me, so I should be happy that he thought about me.\n\nYour parent thinking of you is something you should be able to expect, it should not require any additional happiness.  It sounds like this may be a new situation and your father may still be figuring things out in terms of how to integrate his traditions with you and his newer relationships with his fianc\u00e9's kids.  You're definitely NTA, and I was leaning towards N A H, but your father's reaction to your disappointment made him at least a little bit TA.  Maybe try speaking to him about it again when you're not both in the moment of the disappointment.", "Of course you're NTA sweetie! I'm sorry your father doesn't seem to have the capability to listen to you and doesn't seem to prioritize your feelings, or even believe that you should have any of your own thoughts and feelings. Everyone has a right to have whatever feelings that they have about something. And your feelings sound absolutely and completely appropriate for the situation!\n\nHe said the kids were the ones who suggested it so you shouldn't blame him...... What is he? The child in the house? How is it that the children rule him? Of course he's the one to blame...... He's the adult, he could have/should have told them that they need to wait a few days for you to help.\n\nAlso you said that he said \"he tried finding gifts just for you\"...... However, if that were true then you wouldn't have had the exact duplicate gifts everyone else got which is enough to make someone upset in and of itself for him not caring enough to put in any thought towards what you personally would want and like.\n\nBut he should be able to take the broken toys back to get an exchange at the very least. I know it doesn't help at the time but if you suggest it to him hopefully he was smart enough to keep the receipts and he's willing to get an exchange for you at least...... Since he's not willing to care about your feelings. Good luck dear.", "NTA First of all, having feelings he doesn\u2019t like doesn\u2019t make you ungrateful.  I hate when people say that.  If you complained about it then sure, but him trying to read your body language and getting mad because you weren\u2019t overjoyed at a non-personal gift (let\u2019s face it, the same thing for four people is not personal) it\u2019s his problem.  He probably felt guilty because he knew it wasn\u2019t what you wanted and he knew you\u2019d be hurt that he ignored your tree tradition and didn\u2019t even tell you before you saw it. Hopefully he will do a better job communicating with you and his fianc\u00e9 going forward.", "Nta your dads being a bad dad and you\u2019re right to be upset. He\u2019s lazy and blaming children for his mistake. It sucks but don\u2019t let him off the hook because he uses guilt to get out of accountability", "You didn\u2019t overreact. \n\nYour father is dialing it in with you and expecting praise for it. He is in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nAlthough he did buy you gifts, he could have at least been apologetic when he found out they didn't work. Instead, he tried to make you feel bad when you didn't even say anything to him until being prompted. And with the tree, I feel like he could have waited to include you along with his step-children in putting up the Christmas tree. Although that type of stuff could take time, there isn't a time limit on decorating a tree.", "NTA your dad treated u like an after thought and u feel left out \u2026 he should understand", "NTA", "NTA my friend - I am sorry your father reacted so poorly to you being honest about your very valid feelings. I think some of what he said was emotionally manipulative, and having grown up with similar parents, I just want you to know you always deserve your own feelings at all times. Everything you have said is so reasonable and mature I think I as an adult would feel even more hurt than you are expressing in your situation. You are a very good person and you should not put any blame on yourself in this situation \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA Sorry for your crappy day. You were left out of the tree decorating which is a special time for all kids and their parents. Then to bought you cheap toys that you had no use for. That\u2019s got to hurt. You are justified feeling the way you do. If he was strapped for money having extra people to buy for he could have still found something cheap and special. Hope your time with your mom goes better than this doozy of a day. Not that he set the bar very high.", "Info: did any of the children actually like the presents he got them? Idk if someone got me the same present as my different age siblings I\u2019d be pretty disappointed. Especially if one of the gifts was broken", "NTA. Your father screwed up.", "NTA. I suggest accepting that your father is not what you want him to be and giving up on trying because it does not get better and this will only hurt you in the end.", "~~This is mixed, but I'm leaning toward Y T A~~. Yes, the identical gifts showed no effort to treat you all as individuals.\n\n~~The tree is another matter. When it only affected the two of you, it was easy to trim it together. He now has a larger family, and it wouldn't have been just the two of you, regardless. It's okay to miss it, but it's selfish to try to freeze out the other kids.~~\n\nEdit: In light of further information from Op (below), changed to NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad sucks and 20 years from now you\u2019ll be in therapy telling your therapist all about it and she\u2019ll be impressed that you finally allow yourself to feel disgust at his behavior instead of guilt and sadness. Maybe try to skip the 20 years of waiting- it\u2019s pretty cathartic to get out of your system.", "Nta your 16 and he got you kid toys with no thought behind them since all 4 of you got the exact same thing. He didn't try at all and is trying to guilt you into feeling bad. Go no contact for a lil while so he can think about his actions", "Sinterklaas is about the poems and surprises, not the gifts. So he made no sufficient effort.", "NTA. You were disappointed at being left out of a ritual you look forward to, and receiving two broken gifts, that were not specific to you at all. Your dad sounds like he knows he did a bad job this year and tried to project that on you. He was the AH for lecturing you on not properly kissing his ass, after treating you like an afterthought.", "I feel like he genuinely tried to find good gifts, but it\u2019s difficult finding the right things when you need to find gifts for four people. I think I was just really disappointed that so many things were going wrong for me. He might\u2019ve been embarrassed of my reaction, because he\u2019s not the type of person to want praise over little things", "He\u2019s probably also trying to figure out how to deal with so many kids as well, which could be why he reacted like that. I will definitely talk to him about it again. Thanks for advice!", "Wrong. The father is a big asshole. He needs to be the adult and not push his guilt and inability to get it right onto his son.", "I\u2019m not 100% sure because they left soon after, but the 16 year old and 12 year old were enjoying the cubes you could transform. (I really don\u2019t know what the toy is called) They were competing to see who could make the best shapes. The 15 year old continued watching YouTube videos, so I\u2019m assuming they weren\u2019t very interested", "His fianc\u00e9 and her kids actually helped with the tree last year. The problem wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want them to help, just that I didn\u2019t want them to do it without me. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the kids themselves", "But it's okay for the father to freeze out his own son?", "He\u2019s an adult, him being embarrassed isn\u2019t an excuse to be mean and dismissive of you.", "He could have put more effort into finding you gifts you liked, his girlfriend could have found the gifts for her kids, because getting everyone the same gift isn't real mind bending. You need to quit making excuses for someone who made you feel bad but won't own up to it. He gets mad to make you feel guilty and that's not right. You have every reason to be hurt by him ignoring everything you two do together. He's a big boy, he could tell the kids to wait for you. He disrespected you and your feelings. I'm sorry he won't listen, really listen to you.", "For me it's not just about the gifts. After your parents divorce, it was just you. Now it's other people in your traditions and you are struggling to find your place in the new family dynamics. \n\nThe gifts were a slap in the face after the tree incident.", ">I feel like he genuinely tried to find good gifts, but it\u2019s difficult finding the right things when you need to find gifts for four people.\n\nYou know what, though? If you know and care about those four people and their interests, it's actually not that hard. Not buying four of the *exact same thing* for very different people would be a good start. \n\nDon't let your dad's *woe is me* act convince you that buying thoughtful presents is *hard*. It's not. \n\nWell. Unless you aren't thoughtful and don't care. *Then* it's hard. But that's a character flaw on his part, not an excuse or explanation.", "Uh. Even when I have brought four body gift packs for my nieces I made sure to get scents, colours and designs they would like. \n\nIt's not that hard to even half ass a gift for someone, like he could have gotten you a gift card and it sounds like it would have been a better gift.\n\nI agree with everyone saying that it sounds like the issue is that you don't get enough time with him (evident by his shitty gifts) and that the broken gifts broke the damn holding back hour negative feelings. If that is true I suggest writing a letter to your dad because it's an easier way to communicate feelings due to the time it takes to write one. In that letter take the time to articulate best you can how you feel and ways you two might be able to improve your relationship. Even better if you do therapy (alot of kids from divirced parents do) ask your dad to attend a session with you and read the letter to him then do you can have that conversation in a safe place.", "Then realistically I think it's up to your judgment because you're the only one who knows how you acted. If you think you were being sullen and upset to the point where his reaction was justified, then I guess YTA.\n\nHowever, if you think his reaction wasn't justified and he was far too upset with you based on your disappointment then I'm sticking with NTA.\n\nOnly you can tell if your mood/actions justified his response or not.", "Based on your comments it seems like you and your father have a good relationship.  So hopefully this year will be a blip as you all figure out the new dynamic.", ">this was a tradition my dad and I always did together after he and my mom broke up.\n\nThat was the tradition you had, and what you asked about.\n\nIf you'd asked about not waiting until you were there to help, then of course NTA.", "I don\u2019t think I was being too upset when talking to him. (I was desperately trying to hide it) I mostly remember just not sounding as happy as I normally do", "NTA. If he feels bad, he should. He really didn\u2019t do a good job. It is not a child\u2019s job to manage their parent\u2019s emotional responses."]}
