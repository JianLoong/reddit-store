I just had my 3rd and last baby 2 months ago. My husband and older kids (12 + 10) help but like.. it's not really helpful, if that makes sense. Like if I ask someone to watch the baby so I can shower they do but they bring the baby in to the bathroom and keep the curtain open the entire time so the baby can see me (at least 2 out of 3 times). Or if I ask someone else to make dinner, they will but they ask repetitive questions on what to do or how to do it (both my older kids do know how to cook because they took an interest in it early on in life). Any time I ask any of them to hold/keep an eye on the baby for a minute, they absolutely do but they just follow me everywhere with the baby. Saying things like \"what's mama doing?\", \"she will be done in a minute baby and then she will take you back\". And I feel psychotic because they ARE doing exactly what I asked but they just follow me with the baby the entire time OR ask me to walk them through what I asked them to do even though they can do it themselves. Kids and husband. And I have voiced this several times but I don't know if I was being too calm or less stern than I should have been because they just continue doing it. So I just stopped asking and my husband asked why I'm not asking for help anymore and I said \"because you guys really aren't helping me\". He said I'm wrong for saying that.\n\nETA: I've been unclear. I don't ask my other kids to parent the baby. They don't change/burp/feed the baby. They are asked at most once a day to watch the baby for 10 minutes at most; when I am cooking or going to the bathroom or cleaning. I ask them to cook small meals (for themselves) maybe once a week. Something like Mac n cheese or pizza. My husband is the biggest culprit. My kids ASK to watch the baby but I never go more than 10 minutes if they do because 1. it's not their responsibility and 2. they are still kids and a lot could go wrong. I wouldn't ever force my kids to watch their siblings. They literally ask if they can and if I say \"can someone come keep an eye on the baby for a second\" they BOTH come running and fighting over who's going to. Do NOT project you parentification BS on people. That's not what this is. I don't understand how holding a baby or talking to her while she's in her swing is me \"forcing my kids to be parents\". The kids also do not watch the baby while I shower, unless their dad asks them to for whatever reason. Too much could go wrong.

It's your spouse who needs to step up.\n\nCaring for a newborn is genuinely intimidating for kids that age.  They know the child is fragile and needs care, but they don't know how to care for the child.  They also know they aren't ready to care for a newborn, but understand they are members of the family and do want to pitch in.  They struggle to interact with the child since it's still in its \"larvae\" stage and not interacting the way an older baby or other human might, so they really just throw spaghetti at the wall when it comes to interacting with the baby.  They know baby loves mom and gets comfort from mom, so they seek to reassure the child by promising mommy will be back.  Your kids behavior with the baby doesn't read to me as \"deliberately unhelpful\" so much as \"I don't feel safe and confident watching this very fragile baby that I love and would be devastated to mess up, so I'm going to follow mom around so that I feel safer and she can make sure I don't fuck up in a serious way\".  I DID watch newborns solo at 10-12, and it was A LOT.   Not all kids are ready for that.  For childcare, I think you need to lean on your adult spouse because your kids may not be ready to be solo caring for your latest baby until they both get older.  \n\nYour spouse you can tell to step up and parent solo so you can have a break.  Your kids may genuinely not be ready for that burden yet, and if they aren't, then they aren't.  Your spouse can also handle the cooking duties solo, and can field questions from your kids if they need help cooking.  But it's reasonable for kids that age to still have questions, to still need parental guidance and involvement, and to need to know they can still come to their parents with questions and need for assistance even when there's a new baby.  \n\nIt just that this parent shouldn't be YOU right now.  It should be your spouse.", "Sounds terrible, and I admit I had this problem when my son was born.  I remember his dad bringing him to me while I was taking a bath.\n\nBe specific.  Tell them  you need actual down time.  Away from the baby time.  Ask them for what you need, including them doing it without your help, including them not bringing the baby to you while you're getting down time.  \n\nHe's two months not two weeks.  It's time for them to start stepping up.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But it isn\u2019t your kids job to parent your baby. Your husband needs to be the one stepping up.", "NTA\nIn your husband, this type of behavior is called weaponized incompetence. He should know how to take care of himself (at the very least) and get dinner on the table for you and your kids if you're not able to.\n\nYour kids are not assholes, they probably don't even realize that they're just copying their dad. Their behavior should be addressed, and they should learn that when you need a second to address self-care needs, or when you need them to heat up some food, you need them to do it on their own.\n\nThis sounds super stressful, hope you can navigate this situation and get your husband on your side!", "NTA \n\nBut you need to use your words! \n\nTry saying something like this: Can you please watch the baby in the family room while I go take a shower? I want some privacy. I'll let you know when I'm done.\" Leaving the curtain open during your shower is ridiculous! And cold!! Washing certain areas with an audience? F that when you need a break!\n\nThen close and lock the door. Put some music on so you won't be distracted. \n\nAs far as the cooking goes, leave the house (or go to bathroom) with the recipe available for them to read.", "NTA, your kids are NTA, but your husband is TA.", "NTA, but it sounds like you need to be a bit more firm and clearer on the requests/expectations. \"I need you to keep the baby in here, while I go do other things. I'll be back in x time.\" Perhaps even be honest, \"I need you to take the baby so I can do other things, but also because I need to clear my head without anyone around or shower by myself like a normal human or I'm going to lose my mind. Thanks.\"\n\nAs for cooking, as long as you won't be angry if they make a mistake, tell them to figure it out, you believe in the their ability to use Google as necessary.", "NTA but your husband is.

You need to rest more so you can recover. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to ask for help, he should be doing his fair share. Have him take the baby for an evening and treat yourself to an evening out. \nHe is the one who needs to step up more here.", "NTA. I would say that this behavior is acceptable from the kids and unacceptable from your husband.", "NAH\n\nI think this is a completely reasonable conversation to have with your husband, but less so with your kids. The fact that your kids are helping cook and look after the baby is great and should be encouraged and given positive reinforcement. However kids are meant to be kids which means they are still learning. They are not mean to be mini adults. Questions about cooking seem reasonable. You could always direct them to your husband or write down/print out a few really simple fun recipe for them.\n\nAnother tip for the kids is maybe be more specific when you ask them to watch the baby? Maybe say \"while I shower can you take baby to look at the toys in your room or look at the game you are playing\".\n\nI don't think any of you are assholes. It sounds like a tired mom, kids that are trying to do their best and a husband who maybe needs to take a little bit more initiative.", "WTF? Your kids aren't the problem. It's your husband. He's dropping the ball as a parent. Big time. It sounds like he's a bystander in his own infant's life. \n\nGet your husband to step up and be a parent and watch the baby so you have some time to recharge/shower/whatever. \n\nNTA about telling your husband isn't helping. Because he isn't. Don't say that the kids aren't helping. Watching babies even for a few minutes can be daunting to even a 12 yr old. My brother did not watch over me as a baby and he's 10 yrs older...Don't blame them.", "NTA, and neither are your kids. Dad needs to do better.", "NTA. Be very specific and really clear with instructions. I'm going to have a shower by myself, please watch baby out here in the living room while I shower and then LOCK the door. Tell them to watch baby so I can do what ever and watch baby in the other room. Please cook something for dinner that you do not need instructions from me for. I do not want to have to walk you through a dish you already know how to cook. Leave them no wriggle room to get around clearly stated jobs. Sit husband down and explain that you need serious help, not more stress on having to hold hands while you are busy with other tasks. Ask him and make him explain why they are behaving like this and how it must stop.", "It's absolutely absurd to me that children aren't expect to HELP OUT once in awhile. Watching your sibling for a little bit while a parent is otherwise occupied doing a more strenuous task is something as old as time itself, and infanitlizing your children and removing any expectation or opportunity to develop responsibility is how you GET these kinds of situations. Children need to learn - not necessarily how to parent, because that's NOT what this is - but how to be attentive. How to watch out for others. How to have consideration for other's needs - be it their parents or their younger sibling - and learn how different those needs are and why. This also affords them opportunity to build a bond with their sibling in their own way as well as show their parent what skills they are developing. The fact that there are people here considering this as downright neglect or abuse is WILD. It just isn't that dramatic of a situation, for christ's sake. It's not even enough to consider it babysitting.\n\n**NTA** OP and you need to be more clear with your requests. For your children, it's possible they just don't realize the goal of having someone else watch the child - alone time, privacy, being able to focus on whatever task you have on hand. For your husband, he should really be stepping up more in these infrequent times of need. Consider it a very positive sign that he was aware enough to ask why you stopped asking for help -- this shows that he IS watching and he DOES care. Explain your needs and why, and it's my hope that he'll be receptive and understanding. What IS concerning is that it's already the third kid and he's still struggling with proving you adequate support. Have a convo, but gently.", "NTA. Your husband should step up. \n\nOn the meal thing specifically, do you have specific expectations? I\u2019ve dealt with people who didn\u2019t want to get into details on a request, but then turned out to have very specific *expectations* they were unhappy weren\u2019t met. This triggered a lot of \u201chelpless\u201d behavior, because asking annoyed them and not asking also annoyed them. If this sounds at all familiar, some small adjustments on your end may help them step up. \n\nNot trying to blame the stressed out victim, just saying \u201cmake sure you aren\u2019t expecting mind-reading from a ten year old suddenly tasked with dinner-making for four people\u201d, in case that helps you get more help.", "NTA for feeling like too much is on you right now because likely that is how it is.  Caring for an infant is a 24/7 job, and one you get after making the creature, birthing it, and trying to recover from all that.  You just need a break, I mean, a REAL break.  \n\nBe specific on what you need from your husband.  He's the one equally responsible for this little one.  Sure, your kids can help some, but it's likely not reasonable to expect them to be able to be \"full charge\" carers.  Start with that shower.  You DESERVE time to tend to your personal needs.  Make sure you carve out a time each day for it.  Get your husband to help with the understanding that even if the baby cries, you are not to be disturbed for whatever length of time you've agreed upon.  Babies cry, it's typically not a big deal. Your kids can be present and help with this, but Dad needs to be the one who ultimately pilots the boat, not the kids as they are too young for this responsibility.  \n\nWhen you say your family isn't helping, you mean they are not helping like you need.  You NEED them to occasionally be fully in charge without running to you for whatever reason when you are trying to have a few moments to yourself to recharge your batteries.  \n\nCongrats on the new one and hang in there, Mom.  Hopefully you will soon get the type of help you need and have a few minutes every day to yourself.  We all need that, new baby or no.", "NTA.

I\u2019ve been called racist and that my kids are going to need therapy because I didn\u2019t want them using my bathroom when they had their own. Once I was brutally shamed for asking what I should do about a sex offender, who was charged with kidnapping and rape of a child under 12, that walks up and down my street to work. Apparently I was a bully and they felt sorry for him. People on here are generally dumb with little life experience. Don\u2019t take it personally. Your husband needs to step the fuck up though.", "100% correct take. The husband is weaponizing his incompetence, the kids are just age-appropriate levels of incompetent and doing their best to be helpful (even if it isn\u2019t really successful).", "New questions are reasonable. Repeated questions are pleas for attention. It\u2019s not acceptable to relentlessly plea for attention when one is old enough to perform basic tasks independently.", "Parentification IS a thing, but this isn\u2019t it.", "Is she also supposed to not piss until the kids are asleep? Not clean or cook?", "What an unfair and unkind thing to say. The other kids are still kids. Of course they want attention! If you were deprived of that in your own childhood, I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t mean other kids should be. Not blaming this mom - I don\u2019t know how her other kids are being treated - just objecting to your comment.", "First off - love the username lmao\nSecond - I think OP was agreeing with you - you said \u201che\u2019s not pulling his weight at all\u201d and OP agreed, saying \u201cno, he\u2019s not.\u201d The wording is confusing but that\u2019s how I read it anyway.", "Ahhhhhh. My bad. I was very confused but that makes sense. lol. \n\nAnd thank you \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
