I can appreciate the artistry of nude photos and I don\u2019t think nude beach are sexual at all. But if someone I know talks about their significant other being nude, I\u2019m instantly more aware of the fact that they have sex with each other. Probably because I\u2019m not attracted to most other nude people, but when I see my fianc\u00e9 nude I do think about the previous times we\u2019ve had sex. If your MIL is the same way (or if she has a stronger link between nudity and sex), then hearing specifically that your husband took the pictures makes it somewhat sexual to her. Which I would have no problem with if I was talking to friends, but I don\u2019t want to know about a family member having sex. Like, I know they are, but I don\u2019t want to KNOW. It\u2019s just something I don\u2019t want to think about. You say that you don\u2019t think nudity is such a big deal, but you also say your husband doesn\u2019t mind having the photos in a way that implies that he does sexualize them.

Heck, some friends might not want to hear about it either. Just because you\u2019re comfortable with nudity doesn\u2019t mean everyone else around you is.

Just know your audience! My dad\u2019s side of the family would have been either horrified by your comment or giggled in private depending on who you were talking to. There were a lot of super conservative members and super open folks on that side and\u2026 it was weird. You had to remember what was appropriate for each person. My mom\u2019s family? This would be a \u2018share where this spot is so I may go there with my partner please\u2019 thing for them. \nHowever! Your MiL\u2019s reaction was\u2026 a bit judgy\u2026 She could have just said the story made her uncomfortable, or that she doesn\u2019t like talking about such things. I mean, my dad had family members who believed sex between married couples only happened for having children, with the lights off, so they didn\u2019t \u2019sin\u2019 by seeing each other nude. And they wore modest clothing to bed. There were also rules that you didn\u2019t talk about sex period. At all. Not even for education. Yes people like this exist, and yes it\u2019s maddening. But it\u2019s their belief and comfort levels. I\u2019d say be yourself, but know your audience. If there\u2019s nudity and/or sex involved, it\u2019s probably not something to tell your MiL\u2026 yet. Or at all. Getting people to change their perspective can be difficult. This might be something you two need to discuss in a different way. Find a way to ask her about why she her opinion on nude art in a way that allows for conversation. Hopefully she\u2019s someone open to listening to a different perspective to learn about it. Just\u2026 be open to listen to her too.\nUntil then, respect that she\u2019s not comfortable with talking about nudity at this time, and just don\u2019t bring that up in stories you tell. You can still be yourself, just remember who you\u2019re talking to about certain topics.", "NTA\n\nWhite southern Americans are very prudish, and you will see this reflected in other comments.

I think you could have just said \"Husband got some good photos,\" and left it at that. They really didn't need to know you were naked.", "NTA. You mentioned your trip.

My husband and I just had a similar situation just this morning. He sent me a particular video that he found hilarious, but it actually highlights an issue about the inequitable distribution of emotional labor between heterosexual couples.

You talked about a holiday at a beautiful place where your husband, who is known to have a photography hobby, was able to take some unique photos capturing not just the beauty of the location but also of the human body. It is pretty clear that it was about the combined rawness of nature and human rather than some kind of sexy photo shoot for the gratification of you and husband or others. Yeah, the latter would be an odd thing to chat about as we generally consider our sex lives to be private. But the fact of you being naked doesn't make it an inherently inappropriate thing to say. Nakedness is not automatically sexual but that doesn't seem to be a point your in-laws get. You didn't do anything wrong but clearly your in-laws are too uptight to share the joy that you and your photographer husband got an opportunity to have this special nature moment. I just wouldnt bother mentioning anything like that again.", "In my opinion NTA. Common y\u2019all are all adults. I do not see the big deal about it.

You kinda put him in the middle, even if he is siding with you, he\u2019s doing so quietly. When there is already a rift between you and the MIL it would be prudent to minimize a more care free attitude until your with friends rather than family. In apologizing you don\u2019t have to take any blame, you can simply explain your feelings towards the artistic endeavor which you didn\u2019t realize it would be upsetting but that you will be more mindful going forward.", "Always know your audience.

We share similar backgrounds. They're playing dumb and naive to be viewed as victim", "Can't even talk about nudity? That's really messed up.", "Agree, I'm no prude but wouldn't feel the need to share this with my parents, in laws or aunts etc. Save  it for your friends or relatives in your age bracket who  wouldn't be bothered. There is a time and place, nude photos aren't relevant to anyone else but you and your partner. YTA", "Ahhhhhhh. So this explains it. What I hate is them trying to paint this as a cultural latino thing. And then when we're sex trafficked and are victims of sexual tourism it's because of people like OP and the people that consume their product", "Fair. I take that advice from you!", "Thanks. Two people have brought that point up since!", "Honestly I\u2019m one of the few people who agree with you. She wasn\u2019t disclosing gratuitous details\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a big deal. NTA", "I think that makes her an AH", "No OP doesn't have a filter. She needs to learn that some things are best kept unsaid and not everything needs to be broadcast", "Agree - taking a few nude pics and saying you did it isn\u2019t titillating. It\u2019s not like a blow by blow account of their sex life?!?", "Thanks! It was wonderful", "To be fair I don\u2019t think this is a boomer thing. A lot of boomers are very open about nudity and sex - the generations after are actually in some ways more rigid.", "Kansas is...not in the Southern U.S. \n\nFrom the comments, the consensus here is that OP needed to read the room and that most people don't want to picture in-laws in the nude. I have a hard time believing the whole thread are prudes from the South...or from Kansas.", "Thanks for the supportive reply!", "Yes I felt a bit clueless!", "Usually he\u2019s pretty good.", "Great memory! Even if I was nervous lol", "Yes, that\u2019s how I intended it. I was my most natural self, in one of the most natural beautiful settings I\u2019ve seen. Being naked felt like part of the story. Not in a sexual way! But a natural way.", "Can I ask you something if you\u2019re comfortable messaging me?", "Thank you, the latinas seem to get it but I may be biased!", "Listen op. You can do what you want. Like take naked pictures etc. But it doesn\u2019t mean you need to advertise it aloud during family meeting with all the MIL and older aunts and uncles in attendance. Like some commented before. Read the room. You can tell it to your friends.  But and especially if you are not so close with your mil, it was a detail that shouldn\u2019t be shared. Unless they ask to see the pictures. \nOversharing is not a way to go. No one stops you from doing something, but they also do t need to hear everything. \nI\u2019ve done fun pictures similar to your (with some clothes on). And no I\u2019m not telling it to my partners mom, however she she isn\u2019t", "He's probably not happy talking about this in front of his mother", "But what if the husband isn\u2019t happy about her talking about the pictures with his family", "Right? My papa would have been hella embarrassed", "I don't view nudity as a big deal either, at all, and am naked in different friend groups sometimes and love a nude beach or a skinny dip. \n\nBut I wouldn't ever bring that up in a conversation with my in laws. Who, by the way, aren't prudes either. It's just something that doesn't need to be discussed between us.", "My mother had been a teacher. She would have been thrilled at your adventure in a girls' conversation, not so much in a mixed group. Men can be pigs at times and you don't want the uncles, cousins, whoever to be thinking about you wet and naked.\n\nBut, it wasn't evil or anything.\n\nDo you, but with just a smidge of caution about word diarrhea - saying too much ;) .", "I think there's a lot of room for nuance in nude photography. Nude modeling can be purely artistic or purely sexual, and most often it falls somewhere in between. I don't think nude modeling is an inherently taboo topic, and I have friends who do it professionally who talk about it very frankly. However, when your husband is the photographer, and with the implication that he \"appreciates\" the photos, this particular photo shoot sounds at least partially sexual in nature, and in my mind,that would make it an inappropriate conversation topic for in-laws.", "It's hard to dail back who you are to make other people happy. I was raised to share all sorts of information freely and wouldn't think twice about mentioning nude art modeling but so many people out there want you to dull your shine because of prudish upbringing", "Chile, I'd never tell my inlaws (whom also happen to be from Kansas and for many generations) that their son/ brother/ cousin took nude photos of me on vacay. And they're not even as old fashioned sounding as OPs inlaws.", "Surely, if it was such a great trip there had to be other things to mention. If not, ithan i would wonder if that's all you're about and have to offer.", "Yep. I bet it\u2019s part of their shtick, \u201coh I\u2019m just a spicy Latina who\u2019s so open and free *hint hint*\u201d", "I won\u2019t disagree with this assessment. Asshole was a bit strong for me on this one but it\u2019s borderline. 29y/o I cut a little slack for room reading inability but as you said, it may just be assholedom", "I\u2019m envious! We\u2019ve been talking about CR for years\ud83d\ude00", "They weren\u2019t publishing. As I did say she should read the room better.", "Honestly I\u2019m sure the photos were beautiful. There are terrible and confronting things in this world such as violence and poverty - for some reason some people get more distressed about nudity? I\u2019ll never get it. Our bodies are beautiful and by that I mean all bodies not just the stereotype.", "Totally fair. I\u2019m learning today.", "Yeah, I hadn\u2019t fully thought about that aspect. I guess visuals to men are a bit different than the visuals to women.", "It really wasn\u2019t sexual, though! I get your point though.", "Feels that way!", "Sex is different to being naked. Not a good comparison and very prudish.", "Go! I\u2019ll point you to this waterfall lol", "So well said! I am proud of the photos, my husband is talented. Nudity is just nature, at least I think so.", "And can\u2019t we look at a nude body and respect it for what it is?", "I'm 61F and we just had our 35th anniversary. My inlaws have been gone a long time, but with my parents I've found its MUCH easier to keep track of what I HAVEN'T told them rather than deal with drama and endless questions after I do tell them things. Especially medical things or vacation things or things our kids are dealing with. Just recently told my parents that I'd been getting shots in my left eye for wet macular degeneration for the last 4+years. Only told them because my dad suddenly had same condition...boy, was there \"WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?!?\" in the air... beats dealing with 4 years of questions though. Pick your battles \ud83d\ude09", "I'm guaranteeing your MIL thinks the same about her interactions with you", "YTA. You're not this ignorant. I also come from a latino 3rd world country background. We know very well what is and isn't appropriate. Let's be fucking real with each other here. You're pissed off she doesn't accept u and \"want to be yourself\" so you purposefully overshardd to shock and scandalize her, and in the process make her look like the asshole. What this all tells me is that she probably has very good reasons to no accept you if this is the sort of antics you pull.", "Because they are her partner's family and its a reflection of her respect for her partner's life as a whole??", "should have been obvious over 20 years ago......", "Yes Nice memories for you and your husband.. But\u2026Why talk about the pics?\n\nYou created more distance between you and your MIL unnecessarily. Some things are better left as nice memories between you and your husband. Not everyone wants to hear about a naked photo shoot!! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a \n\nYTA \u2026", "OK, but you going on about getting naked with the man you have sex with at the dinner table with his family is usually going to be seen as inappropriate.", "Anyone with common sense should know that both are topics best steered away from when you are having a conversation with family.", "Whenever someone drops bombs with an ethnic flair, you know it\u2019s hitting different and that gives me a good laugh. Hilarious threads on this one", "Wow ok.", "bingo! OP YTA and you just brought this up for attention and to piss off your MIL.", "Es obvio que si se iba a escandalizar la suegra, pero pues ya pas\u00f3, no entiendo porque la gente est\u00e1 atacando de esa manera."]}
