That's who you should be having this conversation with.", "NAH this is a know your audience kind of story. In my family, you would have made people very uncomfortable as we simply don\u2019t talk about things like nudity. Maybe in small groups with close relatives, (caught my mom and aunt giggling over a phallic turkey neck boiling in a pot once) but a DIL openly talking about getting naked? My parents love Game of Thrones but this would be completely out of their experience for conversation topics. Still in my BFFS family, You\u2019d be ok - might have got ribbed a little because they are that kind of family, but overall they\u2019d laugh it off if they were uncomfortable. Probably a story to tell friends, not in laws.", "ESH.  \n\nAlthough it might be true, having a naked photo shoot seems like something you tell your friends, not your in-laws.\n\nBut once she said it, she should have just let it go and not try to correct you.", "YTA. There was absolutely no reason to mention taking nude photographs. It wasn\u2019t relevant to the story at all. You knew you were in mixed company.", "Errr yeah YTA, in laws aren't the time and place to talk about stripping off", "Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing but I would be mortified to tell my MIL that I don\u2019t get along with all about my recent nudes, that is pretty inappropriate", "Yeah, YTA. This is a vacation story you share with your friends, not your in laws. Think about it this way - do you want your FIL picturing you naked? Or your MIL? I\u2019m certain they don\u2019t want that. \n\nAlso I feel like you partially brought this up for the reaction because you don\u2019t feel fully accepted by her. So have that conversation instead of doing something that you know is going to get a reaction because it is inappropriate to bring up with that group of people.", "Unpopular, but how is that information of any relevance to other people? \n\nHaving said that, NTA. You can say whatever you want and you didn\u2019t offend anyone.", "NTA, it's not like you were going into graphic detail about anything sexual. It's not even like you exposed your nude photos (however artistic and non-sexual they might have been) to everyone,You're just mentionning a nice hike you had. It's just weird of MIL to sexualize family like that.", "Titillate... I see what you did there. NTA. Your MIL is just a prude.", "She does know that underneath everybody's clothes they are COMPLETELY NAKED!!!!?\n\nNTA", "NTA she\u2019s puritan and looking for ways to dislike you. Just be your beautiful artsy self", "NTA and hubby needs to handle it. She is disrespecting you because he is letting her get away with it. This will eventually drive a wedge between you and your husband, IMO. \n\nAsk me how I know", "NTA. She\u2019s a prude. Your husband should also show a bit of support and say something to her though.", "NTA.\n\nIf it wasn't the comment, dear MIL would have found something else to complain about.   \n\nWhy are puritanical people sooooooo obsessed with sex and \"titillation\"?
