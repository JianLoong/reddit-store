In my family, you would have made people very uncomfortable as we simply don\u2019t talk about things like nudity. Maybe in small groups with close relatives, (caught my mom and aunt giggling over a phallic turkey neck boiling in a pot once) but a DIL openly talking about getting naked? My parents love Game of Thrones but this would be completely out of their experience for conversation topics. Still in my BFFS family, You\u2019d be ok - might have got ribbed a little because they are that kind of family, but overall they\u2019d laugh it off if they were uncomfortable. Probably a story to tell friends, not in laws.", "ESH.  \n\nAlthough it might be true, having a naked photo shoot seems like something you tell your friends, not your in-laws.\n\nBut once she said it, she should have just let it go and not try to correct you.", "YTA.

This is a vacation story you share with your friends, not your in laws. Think about it this way - do you want your FIL picturing you naked? Or your MIL? I\u2019m certain they don\u2019t want that. \n\nAlso I feel like you partially brought this up for the reaction because you don\u2019t feel fully accepted by her.

Prudes to the core. NTA and I think it sounds lovely and spontaneous and romantic.", "NTA, I tell everyone my naked waterfall story...no one seems bothered...similar story but got naked to go in the waterfall then my partner who is usually too shy to do this did it for the first time too. Told my Mum right after, she is 84 and American, no issue...she just thought it was a cute story. It was funny as after we realized a guy was watching us....but we were in Spain and no one was worried. Being naked does not equal sex.", "I mean I wouldn't have said it because people are uptight but no you're not an asshole for saying it You're just different than them", "Thanks for your thoughts. Lots to think about I guess. I don\u2019t feel that nudity is such a big deal but I see your point.", "Ha, ok, that\u2019s fair. Thanks for the feedback.", "Ha, ok that\u2019s fair!", "Thank you! Means a lot that you say that. Are you American?", "So I\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t necessarily link nudity to sex. I can appreciate the artistry of nude photos and I don\u2019t think nude beach are sexual at all. But if someone I know talks about their significant other being nude, I\u2019m instantly more aware of the fact that they have sex with each other. Probably because I\u2019m not attracted to most other nude people, but when I see my fianc\u00e9 nude I do think about the previous times we\u2019ve had sex. If your MIL is the same way (or if she has a stronger link between nudity and sex), then hearing specifically that your husband took the pictures makes it somewhat sexual to her. Which I would have no problem with if I was talking to friends, but I don\u2019t want to know about a family member having sex. Like, I know they are, but I don\u2019t want to KNOW. It\u2019s just something I don\u2019t want to think about. You say that you don\u2019t think nudity is such a big deal, but you also say your husband doesn\u2019t mind having the photos in a way that implies that he does sexualize them. So I do think that the issue is more about hearing about a family member\u2019s sex life than whether or not nudity is inherently sexual.", "Yep! And not prudish in the least, thank Goddess!", "Ok, this is really well thought out. Thanks for this. Lots to think about.", "People get naked, people have sex, it's no mystery.  The subject of being naked anywhere should not be taboo.  \n\nI'm wondering why OP even bothers talking to these people to begin with, just find somewhere to browse your phone and forget they even exist.", "[deleted]", "Go right ahead.", "And \u201cenjoying having\u201d those photos", "Sent!", "YTA. \n\nRead the room. How about *husband took some really great photos of me!*", "Your mil is asking for you to respect the boundaries in her family. I see nothing wrong with that.", "Lol YTA.", "YTA. Totally unnecessary to mention to his family members that you got naked and took photos at a waterfall. The fact that you don\u2019t see it as a problem makes me wonder if you say things like this regularly (without reading the room) and maybe that\u2019s why MIL has a problem with you. Also, who knows if other people felt the same way your MIL did, she was just the one who said it to you.", "YTA\u2014Read the room and have some decorum. Not an appropriate conversation around them. Heck, some friends might not want to hear about it either. Just because you\u2019re comfortable with nudity doesn\u2019t mean everyone else around you is. It\u2019s giving main character syndrome.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\n\nLol look at their comments, they\u2019ve only posted this to promote their sex work", "NTA, but now you know that Americans are weird about nudity, you would be TA if you bought it up again in a group of Americans. (At least middle-of-the-country Americans. I've wandered onto clothing optional beaches on places like Hawaii, and no one there had any issues.)", "NTA but definitely a chronic TMI giver. Definitely a piece of the story that wasn\u2019t necessary. Maybe read the room and know your audience a little better.", "Aaaaaaaaahhhh!! NO! Don\u2019t change who you are!!! Just know your audience! My dad\u2019s side of the family would have been either horrified by your comment or giggled in private depending on who you were talking to. There were a lot of super conservative members and super open folks on that side and\u2026 it was weird. You had to remember what was appropriate for each person. My mom\u2019s family? This would be a \u2018share where this spot is so I may go there with my partner please\u2019 thing for them. \nHowever! Your MiL\u2019s reaction was\u2026 a bit judgy\u2026 She could have just said the story made her uncomfortable, or that she doesn\u2019t like talking about such things. I mean, my dad had family members who believed sex between married couples only happened for having children, with the lights off, so they didn\u2019t \u2019sin\u2019 by seeing each other nude. And they wore modest clothing to bed. There were also rules that you didn\u2019t talk about sex period. At all. Not even for education. Yes people like this exist, and yes it\u2019s maddening. But it\u2019s their belief and comfort levels. I\u2019d say be yourself, but know your audience. If there\u2019s nudity and/or sex involved, it\u2019s probably not something to tell your MiL\u2026 yet. Or at all. Getting people to change their perspective can be difficult. This might be something you two need to discuss in a different way. Find a way to ask her about why she her opinion on nude art in a way that allows for conversation. Hopefully she\u2019s someone open to listening to a different perspective to learn about it. Just\u2026 be open to listen to her too.\nUntil then, respect that she\u2019s not comfortable with talking about nudity at this time, and just don\u2019t bring that up in stories you tell. You can still be yourself, just remember who you\u2019re talking to about certain topics.", "NTA\n\nWhite southern Americans are very prudish, and you will see this reflected in other comments. I lived in the US Bible Belt for a long time so I understand them", "NTA. That the MIL accused you of titillating everyone with your story makes her TA. I am Latina as well, so I get you. Yeah, maybe avoid the intimate details in the future. But NTA in this instance.", "Why does she give a shit? This wasn\u2019t gross indecency . It sounds relatively innocent. But maybe you should read the room better.", "NTA. i went to a burlesque show with my own parents this weekend, who are in their fifties. we all had an amazing time. \n\njust because she's an easily titillated, boring, old midwesterner with no self awareness to that fact doesn't mean you're wrong, dirty, or rude for mentioning that you have a naked body under your clothes. we really need to stop allowing boomers this snowflake treatment; they do not offer us the same courtesy.", "NTA, be yourself, just sensor when near the ILs. I think you could have just said \"Husband got some good photos,\" and left it at that. They really didn't need to know you were naked.", "NTA. You mentioned your trip. Any healthy adult knows there is nudity in the world. Your MIL should never go to a beach near Germans! Or any other European culture that strips to the skin to swim or sauna.\n\nThis is your husband's family, so let husband handle them. Sorry you have had this experience.", "There are some people I'd mention that fact to, and some I would not. My in laws or my immediate family ate in the groups I would not.\n\nI mean, why would you think they'd want to hear that? Seems inappropriate and weird to me.", "NTA.  Be yourself.  Doesn't mean you need to tell them lol.   Using discretion and knowing your audience will save you all this hassle.  They didn't need to know those details. \ud83d\ude09", "Possibly unpopular opinion here: NTA because how were you supposed to know that this is a culturally inappropriate thing? We're prudes in the US about sex and nudity. If you did it again though after hearing her feelings, then it would be a totally different matter.", "Next time!", "Totally agree with this take. My husband and I just had a similar situation just this morning. He sent me a particular video that he found hilarious, but it actually highlights an issue about the inequitable distribution of emotional labor between heterosexual couples. As this is an issue that has been plaguing our marriage, I didn't find it very funny. He got upset with me because \"it was just a joke.\" But this is a case of knowing your audience. I find a lot of things funny, but this isn't one of them. \n\nDefinitely know your audience.", "Thanks. Lesson learned!", "Ok thank you for this I have so many follow up questions!", "So I\u2019m learning!", "Thank you! Where are you from? Message me for a sec?", "Basically innocent!", "Bravo!
