I can appreciate the artistry of nude photos and I don\u2019t think nude beach are sexual at all. But if someone I know talks about their significant other being nude, I\u2019m instantly more aware of the fact that they have sex with each other. Probably because I\u2019m not attracted to most other nude people, but when I see my fianc\u00e9 nude I do think about the previous times we\u2019ve had sex. If your MIL is the same way (or if she has a stronger link between nudity and sex), then hearing specifically that your husband took the pictures makes it somewhat sexual to her. Which I would have no problem with if I was talking to friends, but I don\u2019t want to know about a family member having sex. Like, I know they are, but I don\u2019t want to KNOW. It\u2019s just something I don\u2019t want to think about. You say that you don\u2019t think nudity is such a big deal, but you also say your husband doesn\u2019t mind having the photos in a way that implies that he does sexualize them.

Heck, some friends might not want to hear about it either. Just because you\u2019re comfortable with nudity doesn\u2019t mean everyone else around you is.

Just know your audience! My dad\u2019s side of the family would have been either horrified by your comment or giggled in private depending on who you were talking to. There were a lot of super conservative members and super open folks on that side and\u2026 it was weird. You had to remember what was appropriate for each person. My mom\u2019s family? This would be a \u2018share where this spot is so I may go there with my partner please\u2019 thing for them. \nHowever! Your MiL\u2019s reaction was\u2026 a bit judgy\u2026 She could have just said the story made her uncomfortable, or that she doesn\u2019t like talking about such things. I mean, my dad had family members who believed sex between married couples only happened for having children, with the lights off, so they didn\u2019t \u2019sin\u2019 by seeing each other nude. And they wore modest clothing to bed. There were also rules that you didn\u2019t talk about sex period. At all. Not even for education. Yes people like this exist, and yes it\u2019s maddening. But it\u2019s their belief and comfort levels. I\u2019d say be yourself, but know your audience. If there\u2019s nudity and/or sex involved, it\u2019s probably not something to tell your MiL\u2026 yet. Or at all. Getting people to change their perspective can be difficult. This might be something you two need to discuss in a different way. Find a way to ask her about why she her opinion on nude art in a way that allows for conversation. Hopefully she\u2019s someone open to listening to a different perspective to learn about it. Just\u2026 be open to listen to her too.\nUntil then, respect that she\u2019s not comfortable with talking about nudity at this time, and just don\u2019t bring that up in stories you tell. You can still be yourself, just remember who you\u2019re talking to about certain topics.", "NTA\n\nWhite southern Americans are very prudish, and you will see this reflected in other comments.

I think you could have just said \"Husband got some good photos,\" and left it at that. They really didn't need to know you were naked.", "NTA. You mentioned your trip.

My husband and I just had a similar situation just this morning. He sent me a particular video that he found hilarious, but it actually highlights an issue about the inequitable distribution of emotional labor between heterosexual couples.

You talked about a holiday at a beautiful place where your husband, who is known to have a photography hobby, was able to take some unique photos capturing not just the beauty of the location but also of the human body. It is pretty clear that it was about the combined rawness of nature and human rather than some kind of sexy photo shoot for the gratification of you and husband or others. Yeah, the latter would be an odd thing to chat about as we generally consider our sex lives to be private. But the fact of you being naked doesn't make it an inherently inappropriate thing to say. Nakedness is not automatically sexual but that doesn't seem to be a point your in-laws get. You didn't do anything wrong but clearly your in-laws are too uptight to share the joy that you and your photographer husband got an opportunity to have this special nature moment. I just wouldnt bother mentioning anything like that again.", "In my opinion NTA. Common y\u2019all are all adults. I do not see the big deal about it.

You kinda put him in the middle, even if he is siding with you, he\u2019s doing so quietly. When there is already a rift between you and the MIL it would be prudent to minimize a more care free attitude until your with friends rather than family. In apologizing you don\u2019t have to take any blame, you can simply explain your feelings towards the artistic endeavor which you didn\u2019t realize it would be upsetting but that you will be more mindful going forward.", "Always know your audience.

Husband passed three years ago so my very close friends are my 'family' but some of the tests, and medical examinations I wouldn't share even with my closest. I make my decisions for myself, my education and personal situation - being on my own without physical help - but I don't need lectures about 'why did you let them give you that med'? Why didn't they do this test instead of that's? And although my friends mean well they AREN'T medically trained and it is my decision on how I continue through this glorious trip they call life.\n\nBefore my husband passed away (9 days in ICU at beginning of Covid & hadn't been sick before this) I asked him what he wanted me to do. We'd been together just over 30 years & eventually you have these conversations. I asked who he wanted me to call first? Do I tell them everything or only what we'd gone through most recently - 2 types of Stage 4 cancer - I knew what his answers would be based on our years together but wanted to make sure I had HIS permission to 'speak my truth' to his family and explain OUR circumstances and beliefs to them. Was not as painful as I thought with them - just the aftermath of being on my own these last three years and not having him here for his well founded knowledge of my thoughts and feelings.\n\nSorry if this got a bit long. Family not always need to be in your business is my opinion and if they are offended you are the one who has to deal with your own medical situation(s) sometimes for month/years."]}
