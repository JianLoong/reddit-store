Recently I was on a long haul international flight. Usually I sleep on flights but this was during my waking hours so I decided to spend my time enjoying the inflight entertainment and free drinks. I had already been drinking even before the flight while I was in the lounge. I was not slurring or excessively drunk but I was feeling a strong buzz. Usually I don\u2019t chat with my co-passengers, I just sleep or do my own thing. On this flight the configuration of the business class cabin was such that the passengers in the middle row were practically just beside each other. There was just a small barrier separating me and my co-passenger (F, mid 30s) that could be raised but it still didn\u2019t do much to separate us. She started up a conversation and being a little intoxicated, I was also feeling chatty. When she asked what I do I mentioned I\u2019m a doctor and I work at such and such hospital. After some more small talk we both started doing our own thing.\n\nI was trying to watch my movie and enjoy my drinks when an announcement was made asking if there was a doctor on flight. Normally I would present myself to the cabin crew and help out but after several hours of on flight boozing, I was pretty drunk. I was not able to think clearly and probably would have done more harm than good in such a situation. I didn\u2019t react to the announcement at all. I continued watching my movie and drinking my drink. My co-passenger tapped  me and said they just announced they need a doctor. I replied that someone else would help or they would get instructions from the medical team on the ground. She tried convincing me to go help but I refused. She then said I was an unbelievable AH and if the passenger died it was my fault. I said listen lady, just because I\u2019m a doctor doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not on call 24/7 to provide medical care on demand. I work when I\u2019m at the hospital, outside I\u2019m just like everyone else and I\u2019m entitled to drink and relax. She had a disgusted look on her face but didn\u2019t talk to me after that. I didn\u2019t want to engage with her either. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what happened to the passenger who needed medical assistance but since I didn\u2019t hear any more announcements I assumed all was well. While exiting the aircraft this lady called me an AH again.\n\nIn my mind, I\u2019m very clear that since I was intoxicated I could not provide medical assistance. I was drinking on my own time and there was no expectation that I would need to be sober. Doctors get to enjoy life too, I can\u2019t stay sober on every flight just in case there\u2019s an emergency. I don\u2019t think AITA, but I thought I\u2019d get external opinions.

Maybe that's only an Aussie thing.", "NAH you were too intoxicated to render help, so NTA for not getting up to help. But I don\u2019t blame her for thinking you\u2019re an asshole, so NTA for her, too.

Not your decision not to offer medical services.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly the right thing - helping while intoxicated is an incredibly dangerous thing to be doing and should only be an absolute last resort.\n\nDid you actually make this point to the other traveller though? You mention telling her how others should help or they can get advice from the ground, but not actually 'I have been drinking and am in no state to safely give medical advice.'", "*sucks air through teeth* I\u2019m gonna say NTA on the basis that you were too drunk to be offering medical assistance. It\u2019s another person\u2019s health at risk and if you botched something up because you were intoxicated, you\u2019d be haunted by this for the rest of your life.

My mums a nurse and she said that medical staff (nurses, doctors, surgeons, what-have-you) have a legal obligation to assist someone in a public setting if they become unwell or need medical assistance. My mum had to attend to someone having a seizure/fractured skull at our local airport when we were going on holiday.

That\u2019s not a risk worth taking.", "NTA for not volunteering, but YTA for how you handled it.

Your reason made you sound like TA.", "When people say \"I don't owe them an explanation\" that also kind of implies they're happy to let the other person think whatever they think. You don't then get to be mad about their perception of you.\n\nAlso you say you didn't owe her one after she called you an asshole but you didn't give one while she was trying to convince you either, which was what led to her calling you an asshole in the first place.\n\nSo yeah, YTA. Not for not helping but for literally everything else, including making this reddit post.", "Ah the classic physician taking a long round about way of dealing with the situation rather than a simple practical solution where you tell your co-passenger you\u2019re under influence.
