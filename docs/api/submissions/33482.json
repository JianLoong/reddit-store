{"id": 33482, "submission_id": "18nm26n", "title": "AITA for refusing to volunteer as a doctor on a flight?", "selftext": "I\u2019m (M, mid 30s) a medical doctor working as an internal medicine hospitalist at a major hospital. Recently I was on a long haul international flight. Usually I sleep on flights but this was during my waking hours so I decided to spend my time enjoying the inflight entertainment and free drinks. I had already been drinking even before the flight while I was in the lounge. I was not slurring or excessively drunk but I was feeling a strong buzz. Usually I don\u2019t chat with my co-passengers, I just sleep or do my own thing. On this flight the configuration of the business class cabin was such that the passengers in the middle row were practically just beside each other. There was just a small barrier separating me and my co-passenger (F, mid 30s) that could be raised but it still didn\u2019t do much to separate us. She started up a conversation and being a little intoxicated, I was also feeling chatty. When she asked what I do I mentioned I\u2019m a doctor and I work at such and such hospital. After some more small talk we both started doing our own thing.\n\nI was trying to watch my movie and enjoy my drinks when an announcement was made asking if there was a doctor on flight. Normally I would present myself to the cabin crew and help out but after several hours of on flight boozing, I was pretty drunk. I was not able to think clearly and probably would have done more harm than good in such a situation. I didn\u2019t react to the announcement at all. I continued watching my movie and drinking my drink. My co-passenger tapped  me and said they just announced they need a doctor. I replied that someone else would help or they would get instructions from the medical team on the ground. She tried convincing me to go help but I refused. She then said I was an unbelievable AH and if the passenger died it was my fault. I said listen lady, just because I\u2019m a doctor doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not on call 24/7 to provide medical care on demand. I work when I\u2019m at the hospital, outside I\u2019m just like everyone else and I\u2019m entitled to drink and relax. She had a disgusted look on her face but didn\u2019t talk to me after that. I didn\u2019t want to engage with her either. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what happened to the passenger who needed medical assistance but since I didn\u2019t hear any more announcements I assumed all was well. While exiting the aircraft this lady called me an AH again.\n\nIn my mind, I\u2019m very clear that since I was intoxicated I could not provide medical assistance. I was drinking on my own time and there was no expectation that I would need to be sober. Doctors get to enjoy life too, I can\u2019t stay sober on every flight just in case there\u2019s an emergency. I don\u2019t think AITA, but I thought I\u2019d get external opinions.

Had you been in a hospital setting, you would be charged with malpractice if you attempted to practice while inebriated. \n\nIf you had declared yourself a doctor and attempted to provide medical care, you would have been legally responsible. You made the right professional decision and do not owe a random passenger an explanation.", "NTA for not volunteering on the basis that you were intoxicated. You have to be sober to be a good doctor. \n\nBut you could have explained that you had too much to drink to be in a position to act in your profession to the other passenger. So straying into asshole territory just for that.", "NTA - You were drunk. You're not a doctor when you are drunk. You did  absolutely the right thing.\n\nIt sounds like you got defensive when she said that and started emotionally defending your right to a life outside or work, when maybe it would've been better to just say you are intoxicated and it would be harmful to try and help.\n\nAlso, maybe teeny tiny tiny AH vibes by continuing to drink? Maybe you could've begun to sober up just incase. I don't know though I wasn't there.", "You didn\u2019t communicate to your fellow traveler WHY you didn\u2019t volunteer. Now, you are of course entitled to but I can understand why they think you would be aan AH. Now I understand your motive so I think NTAH. If I were you I would  have explained the situation to a steward and check if there was anything you could still be assisting with.", "NTA a drunk doctor is not a good volunteer.", "NTA.\n\nThis literally reminds me of that meme about old-timey doctors \n\nBasically he's drunk and says \"ayy, you got ghosts in your bones, you should do cocaine about that\".\n\nIn short, no. You are not an AH for either A) wanting to use your time off as time off, or B) not acting as a medical professional while under the influence (which I'm sure violates ethics anyway). All around NTA and she should mind her own business.", "NTA - she should mind her own business and not even talk to you", "NTA. You did the right thing.  Your judgement was that you would do more harm than good like under the influence of alcohol.  You know better than anyone the extent you were impacted by the alcohol. You had an ethical duty not to intervene. You also had no duty not to drink because you arent at work, on call, and wouldnt be working before the alcohol wore off.", "NTA. You were drunk and said yourself you were in no condition to help the passanger.", "NTA, but you might have been able to handle this better by either explaining to your co-passenger that you knew you were too buzzed to make any rational decisions for patients and risk losing your license as a result if anything goes wrong.", "NTA for your actions, but you could have certainly put it better to the other passenger. She isn\u2019t inside your body to know that you were definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol you\u2019d consumed. To her you appeared to give this possible emergency the cold shoulder just because you were off the clock. Your decision to not help based on being inebriated was likely the correct choice, since no further calls for help or commotion seemed to happen. From her perspective however, I mean, you certainly come across like an A H. \n\nSo yeah, if it happens again just say you\u2019re too buzzed to be practicing medicine. That\u2019s a perfectly understandable reason and you\u2019re not likely to get stuck to someone pissed off at you during the rest of your flight.", "NTA Dude you were clearly buzzed and while it  is good to help out you aren\u2019t obligated to. Thats equivalent to you at the hospital drunk.", "NTA for not volunteering as you had been drinking. \n\nYTA for your little rant however. You could have just said it\u2019s not ethical because you\u2019ve consumed too much alcohol.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
