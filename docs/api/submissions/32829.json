Auntie had complimented me on a crocheted beanie I was wearing. She asked if I made it and seemed impressed when I told her that I had. So, when I pulled her name for Secret Santa, I thought, *hey, I'll crochet her a beanie.* I also crocheted a shawl to go along with the beanie and I bought one of my favorite candles from Bath and Body Works. I wasn't able to join in on the Christmas festivities because I had to work. At the time, I worked Front Desk at a hotel. We alternated holidays, so because I had Thanksgiving off, I worked Christmas. I gave my brother Auntie's gift to hand out when the time came.\n\nA few days later, I get a phone call from my brother who began to interrogate me about how much I spent. As it turns out, Auntie wasn't as impressed with my crocheted beanie as she let on and made it known she was very offended at my \"cheap\" gift. I already didn't have the best relationship with my SIL and my \"disrespect\" towards her aunt made her dislike me all the more. Apparently, I *misunderstood* the $50 limit. $50 was the MINIMUM, not the maximum.\n\n(Technically, I did spend more than $50...  I bought 3 skeins of yarn that were $12.99 each and the candle was $25 alone....)\n\nI flat out told my brother that SIL and Auntie can kick rocks (my language was just a little more colorful) and I told him that unless it involved just him and/or my niece, I would never attend another function or holiday with SIL and her family.

If you go over to r/JUSTNOMIL, there are a thousand stories about DILs giving ideas/lists of appropriate gifts, and MILs choosing something that is, let\u2019s say, *list adjacent*, or not even on the list at all, and then throwing a huge tantrum because \u201cI wAs JuSt TrYiNg To GeT wHaT yOu WaNtEd, YoU aRe So UnGrATeFuL!\u201d \n\nMy own mom does this sometimes and although it\u2019s usually not too bad, it\u2019s kind of annoying. One year I asked for a set of measuring cups that were my favorite color. Aside from the color, I liked that they included some additional/less common sizes beyond the 4 or 5 you get in most sets (like 1/8 cup, which is useful to have when you make a half recipe of something, as I often do). I sent her a link to the exact ones I wanted, along with some other suggestions, when she asked me for gift ideas. She ended up buying a different measuring cup set, similar color, but that didn\u2019t include the extra sizes. I didn\u2019t say anything to her but this is just an example of how giving someone a very specific gift idea doesn\u2019t always pan out. \n\nI feel like there is likely a whole other side to the story from the DIL that could explain a lot here. I can see why the DIL would give up on providing lists if she spent her time picking out items she and the family would like, only for MIL to go rogue and get something else and then get upset when it\u2019s not what they wanted. \n\nI will also add, the \u201cno small pieces\u201d and \u201cno large toys that take up a lot of space\u201d rules are extremely reasonable. If the grandkids are still young enough that small pieces pose a choking hazard, then it should go without saying that toys with small pieces are not good gifts. (The fact that it has to be said makes me think this already might have been an issue in the past.) And buying lots of big toys that take up a lot of space does get really annoying, really fast. My MIL has done this every year for my daughter\u2019s birthday and for Christmas, and we\u2019ve asked her to stop repeatedly. We literally do not have space for more big toys.
