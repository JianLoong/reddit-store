I called my husband on the way home and said I didn\u2019t feel like cooking so he said he\u2019d order something I could pick up on the way home. I asked him to order me FRIED RICE with STEAK. I get super excited as I\u2019ve had little to eat all day, so I pick up the food and finally get home to eat. I open it\u2026. And there is NO rice. NO steak. Instead, it\u2019s a container full of vegetables with shrimp. I don\u2019t even like shrimp. I was upset because how do you mess something up that bad? I did not yell or b*tch, I just said \u201cwhat is this?\u201d He knew he messed it up and got an attitude with ME!!! He said he could tell I was mad so it made him mad. Wtf? He sure got his own order right. \n\nHe offered to give me some of his rice which is nice but still\u2026 I was just so irritated. Admittedly, I was probably more mad than usual as I was so hungry and had had a bad day. He then asked me if I wanted him to go get shush I to make up for it and I said no, I don\u2019t want sushi. He then proceeds to leave the house and just came back with SUSHI. I DONT FREAKING WANT SUSHI. I know it\u2019s a nice thought but gd I literally said I didn\u2019t want it? Now he\u2019s all mad and confused about why I won\u2019t eat the sushi. I\u2019m fuming. I know it\u2019s not that big of a deal but I haven\u2019t felt this annoyed in a while. Now I\u2019m ignoring him so I don\u2019t snap.

You said no, and he got it anyway.  If he was leaving ANYWAYS, why not go get the correct order????", "NTA \nI can completely understand being at your breaking point after a long crappy day and something like that throwing you over the edge. I don\u2019t think you were being unreasonable either. Idk why he was being such an air head about the order but regardless, getting sushi after you explicitly said no was also a wtf moment too. at that point i would\u2019ve been convinced he was purposefully trying to piss me off \ud83d\ude02 \neven if it was unintentional, still I think you\u2019re justified to be annoyed by it.", "NTA, you explained to him like a toddler what food you wanted, and he didn\u2019t order correctly. i would be irritated too. and then getting you sushi! he just doesn\u2019t seem to listen. also, why isn\u2019t he cooking you dinner? are you the only one who cooks, because if so, it makes sense that he\u2019d order the wrong food, i\u2019m sensing some weaponized incompetence that was babied by his mommy all his life vibe. not to be harsh, but what other reason would be acting this way?", "How does one mix up fried rice with steak with shrimp with vegetables?  They are not even close.\nNTA", "Why didn't he leave the house and get you the rice and steak thing that you wanted? Why did he insist on leaving and getting you sushi?", "You say it isn\u2019t a big deal. WTF? He had 2 opportunities to do something as simple as order you the food you wanted, but ignored you?\n\nNTA", "INFO: Is this a pattern with him not listening to you? If so, it\u2019s very rude and disrespectful. You have every right to be angry. NTA", "NTA, how hard is it to get a order right. Also, a partner should know what you don\u2019t like! \n\nI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m quite picky about food and my husband knows all of my food rules. As I also know how he likes things.", "NTA.\nYou asked for something specific. He didn\u2019t get it and it probably feels like it was on purpose. Also, if he went out to get sushi, why couldn\u2019t he just go back to the restaurant and get you what you asked for to begin with?! Seriously, who does that?!", "NTA. We're all entitled to meltdowns now and then, especially when hangry after a long and stressful day. Instead of listening to your needs and being understanding, he did what he thought was best for you, which doesn't generally line up. He then turned himself into the victim and blamed you for making him act out, further enabling future behaviors and delegitimizing your thoughts and feelings. Yes, you could have handled it better, but he really should have done better by you just out of love and respect.", "NTA. He ordered you a 'healthy meal'. On every Chinese food menu there's the 'healthy, low fat' portion, and veggies with shrimp is always the first thing listed. Honestly if it was me I'd ask him why TF he thought I needed that?", "You don\u2019t like shrimp but he ordered it for you to eat?", "If it were me, although I will preface right here that I am an ah, I would have just taken his container of rice and replaced it with the veggies and eaten the rice. That's essentially what he did to you. You ordered rice. He gave you veggies. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You should have taken his meal and left him with the shrimp and veggies.\n\nI don\u2019t think this was an accident. He was close enough for you to go to the correct restaurant to pick it up while picking something quite opposite to what you actually wanted. What I\u2019m not sure about (as your husband is a total stranger) is if this was weaponized incompetence, or him enjoying disappointing you, or body shaming by ordering what he thinks you should be eating.", "So, this isn't weaponised incompetence and it isn't him being an airhead.\n\nFried rice with steak is a high calorie meal. Shrimp and vegetables is the lowest calorie meal you can possibly get.\n\nYou need to be fucking \\*worried\\* that he's controlling your food intake. NTA", "Every dude in the comments is always like \"if you'd just tell us directly what you want!!\" And then this. Looool.\n\nBut honestly, I understand why you're pissed but if this is a weird one off I'd move past it.\n\nThe most important question is have you eaten something by now?? \ud83d\ude02", "I suspect her husband is sneakily trying to get her to eat light, why fish and veggies instead od steak and rice... His memory is selective cause he got his Own order right and he comes back with sushi, a relatively light food, yes there's rice but it has veg and fish as well. He's a passive aggressive prick", "NTA \u2014 you were hangry, we\u2019ve all been there. \n\nYou specified what you wanted. He could of called you back if he had forgotten and was unsure prior to ordering.\n\nCan he cook? \n\nNothing says I\u2019m sorry like a good cut of steak cooked with rosemary and red wine with a side of jasmine rice poured over with gravy from the pan.  \n\nSorry \u2014 now you\u2019re making me think about steak, dammit\u2026", "NTA\u2014your order was literally 4 simple words: fried rice with steak, none of which were used in whatever he actually ordered you (except maybe \u201cwith\u201d)", "NTA. Does he ever actually listen to you or does he know best?", "You are married to an idiot. My condolences.", "NTA no offense but is your husband mentally challenged", "Does it not give you the ick, its really inept and annoying for adults to be like this with their spouse, tf did he learn prior to marrying you, that you're easy to forget about? You told him your order and he chose a completely random dish, so he didint listen to a word of what you said about your bad day and food order ( managed his own though ) and then proceeded to offer his rice.. HIS RICE, ordered himself fucking rice. You know what this is actually irratating NTA but you're enabling one", "NTA - How can your husband be so stupid no wonder you got so annoyed.", "He is shit testing you. He is pushing you into a fight so that he can have a tantrum. Does he like to leave when he is mad?", "NTA your husband has a listening problem so next time you order and get what you want and get him something he doesn't like and get mad at him as soon as he sees what he got then tell him huh sucks when someone completely ignores what you said you wanted and just gets whatever even though they know you don't like what they got next time actually order what I ask for", "NTA. It is a big deal. He demonstrated how little you mean to him by ignoring what you said. That is a very big deal.", "I'd be just as pissed, Fried Rice & Steak and he gives you shrimp?\n\nI'm allergic to Shrimp, so I'd be definitely losing my shit here \"You trying to kill me?!\"\n\nSo, since I'd have also lost my shit, NTA.", "NTA - Almost sounds if he is using the weaponized incompetence method so he does not have to do anything. It's really difficult to completely mess up an order twice.", "What you described isn't a tantrum? It sounds like you're asking if you're the AH for simply experiencing a less than enjoyable emotion in response to your husband completely disregarding your request. You're allowed to feel anger, you know. A tantrum would be yelling, screaming, crying, etc, it doesn't sound like that happened at all.", "NTA. Shrimp & veg is basically exact opposite of rice & steak. If he got steak & noodles or something, maybe he could get a pass. But his \"mistake\" seems unfathomable. And then instead of going to get sushi, why not go back & get the actual steak rice?? Makes zero sense whatsoever.", "NTA. Why is he *not* listening to you at all?", "NTA.  I think you were out of your mind with hunger and his attitude set you off.  I\u2019ve been like this, and I just can\u2019t bring myself to fault you.  You said what you wanted, and he did the opposite.", "NTA. You literally told him exactly what you wanted word for word and he ordered not only something totally different, but something you don\u2019t even like, whilst having no trouble ordering his food correctly. At the end of a long day, if I made it that easy for my husband and he went out of his way to screw it up, I\u2019d be livid. I\u2019d be mad at anytime tbh. The fact he then doubled down on it and went and bought you something else that you explicitly stated you didn\u2019t want, and at no point the thing you asked for, makes it really hard to believe all this wasn\u2019t deliberate! Because I can\u2019t think of a reason why someone would do that TWICE in one night, knowing their wife had a bad day.", "NTA\nSorry to say this but I feel like this is a prank and a very bad one. \nIf this is a pattern, then it is just plain sad and he needs to be checked up.\n\nMaybe, once you're comfortable, have an honest and open discussion and see why he did what he did and express how it made you feel.", "Totally NTA. Is rather he not bother at all, rather than have him bring me stuff that I can't eat/don't want. His disrespect towards your preferences is appalling.", "NTA he didn\u2019t even order you something close to what you wanted", "NTA. Does he always ignore what you say and just do what he wants? He\u2019d get sick of me real quick if I was constantly ignored.", "If someone can\u2019t even follow simple request and know they messed up, instead of offering to fix it and offered something totally different, that some child ass. Grown tf up. Can\u2019t believe people like this have the right to vote and marry. NTA", "Wait, I get he could reasonably make a mistake ordering but how after telling him you don\u2019t want sushi he still went and got it? Does he have a hearing issue, or another disability that impaired his listening or comprehension skills? \nNTA btw", "NTA. You were HANGRY and he had the audacity to give you attitude when HE MESSED UP. Listening isn\u2019t that hard.", "i wonder how he managed to screw up this badly. NTA...", "NTA. Now take his wallet and order 4 meals for just yourself cause that's what he just did", "Wait so he got your order wrong, and his included the rice you wanted and he just kept it? Then offered to get you something else, you said you didn\u2019t want it and he got that? What was stopping him from correcting the original order and picking that up. Could it not be delivered? I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t just about the food, probably more about you doing all of the emotional labour and him always messing up. NTA.", "Girl. NTA. How do you get shrimp from steak?! It may be my pregnancy hormones but I want to cry for you.", "NTA. And to be quite honest, if he pulls that stuff a lot, there's more to it. Careful there.", "NTA at all. Has husband ever made any diet comments? Could this be a diet he\u2019s trying to force on you?", "NTA - When he\u2019s home at lunchtime with you and he decides he\u2019s hungry so he gets up and makes himself a sandwich does he:\n\n1. Make you a sandwich too\n\nOR\n\n2. Sit down and eat his sandwich like you\u2019re not even at home and doesn\u2019t even stop to THINK that you might be hungry too?\n\n\nBut then he EXPECTS YOU to make lunch or dinner for the 2 of you when YOU decide that you are hungry and start to make something to eat\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation with this guy\n\nHe\u2019s only thinking about his own wants and needs \n\nAnd is not giving ANY THOUGHT AT ALL to YOUR wants & needs\n\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty selfish attitude to have to deal with every day", "NTA. He did this on purpose. He 'made a mistake' to get you to 'pick a fight with him'. He doesn't like you. He's trying to control and manipulate you. I bet he 'makes little mistakes' like this often. Wanna know how I know he did this on purpose (besides it being obvious)? He could have blamed the 'mistake' on the restaurant, but he didn't. Then he deliberately got you something you didn't want to 'make you happy'. I bet he often whines that you are never satisfied. Makes me wonder if he wants you to leave him, so the breakup will be 'all your fault for being petty over nothing'.", "NTA. \n\nMy FIL used to do this to me all the time. My in-laws would invite us over weekly so I didn't have to worry about planning, cooking, and cleaning up dinner. Whenever he'd pick up an order from a restaurant my order was always wrong, like super wrong. As in nothing I wanted was there in any way, shape, or form. No matter what I did to help him - write it down, text it to him, call him while he's at the restaurant - it'd be wrong or even missing. But you bet your ass he'd get his order correct.", "NTA He is not listening.\n\n1) Get him broccoli and tofu next time for revenge. \n\n2) Consider carrying tasty yet healthy snack box to avoid \"HANGER\"", "Mostly I'm picking up on the \"I'm mad because you got mad at me\" - that's controlling (or attempting to be controlling) behavior. It is a \"if you express a negative emotion around or to me, I will then be negative at you so you stop doing that.\" \n\nI agree it is deliberate. The food choices, the \"How dare you get mad at me, now I'm mad at you\", all of it. \n\nDoes he do this a lot? Is this new? You are NTA for getting angry or upset with him and he has no ground to stand on.", "INFO: do you have positive confirmation that he ordered you the wrong thing, or is it possible that the restaurant gave you the wrong entr\u00e9e?\n\nDoesn\u2019t excuse the sushi, for sure, but given your admission of being hangry, you could be jumping to blame him for something someone else messed up.", "NTA. Things like this that seem small can compound one another and make a person snap, especially if they are already having a bad day. And the fact that he did it twice and then blamed you for being upset is borderline manipulative.", "NTA.  Does he have cognitive issues or he just doesn't give a crap?", "NTA. What's the bet he bought you something he likes so he could have the leftovers, and then bought SOMETHING ELSE that he likes and you didn't want so he could eat that too? Or else he got you something completely different to what you asked for so you won't ever ask him to buy you food again. What the hell.", "NTA, he either doesn't listen or was intentionally trying to irritate you. Especially with the sushi.", "Nta. Why didn\u2019t he go out and get what you wanted?", "NTA. My boyfriend of a year can list what I like at most restaurants and guess pretty accurately if we haven\u2019t been there before and listens when I talk about something even if it was 3 months ago he remembers and would get it. It\u2019s no way on earth you\u2019re still with a man who can\u2019t even listen to you for 30 seconds and then get upset with you because he didn\u2019t listen", "What the actual ffff is wrong with your husband? Like seriously. Does he not understand words or does he think he knows your mind better than you do? I would be pissed too\n\nNTA", "NTA. Does he ignore what you say and do something completely different often? Or is this somehow a weird day where he did it twice in a row? \n\nI can understand if he put the order in right and the restaurant messed up. That happens, and is super frustrating. But for him to have put it in completely wrong in the first place? WTF. \n\nMy husband has ordered our food so many times that I've lost count and I can vaguely recall like maybe once that he did it wrong and immediately apologized for it. We also usually text each other our orders so that the person putting in the order doesn't have to remember it to accidentally make a mistake. And then to go get sushi when you told him you didn't want it is beyond comprehension. The clear thing to go out and get is fried rice with steak like you actually wanted. To even suggest sushi as a replacement doesn't make sense, because if he has to go out to get a replacement anyway, then replacing it with ** your actual order** is likely the thing that would \"make it up to you\" the best.", "NTA, this is some passive aggressive shit.  If you cook, shop, bring home food do  same. Knowing how my work hours are, if a mistake,  my spousal unit work have rectified this stat.", "Nta. He's actively not listening.  Get dressed and take yourself out.", "NTA, sounds like weaponized incompetence and a partner who doesn't care enough to remember things that you like. It seems like this is a thing that happened more than once for you to react like that. What you said is right. He didn't forget his own order and then wanted sushi when you said you didn't want it. He doesn't care.", "Nta also not a tantrum", "NTA\n\nI get that this is not a huge issue, but yeah it is entirely find to be pissed at someone who is like this.  It really seems he just ordered what he wanted both times.  If I somehow made that kind of mistake I would order the correct item and go pick it up or get it delivered.  Or heck make it myself. I mean how hard is it to make fried rice. He even has rice in his plate to do so. Was he angry at you for something.  That seems like something who has an axe to grind would do.", "Good lord, is he always THIS dumb?\n\n>I know it\u2019s not that big of a deal\n\nHonestly, it is a big deal.\n\nAfter a long day, you just want to sit down, eat a nice meal, relax and do fuck all for the rest of the day.\n\nAnd his dumb decisions caused you to not be able to do that.\n\nAND HE MESSED UP.......**TWICE**.\n\nAt that point, i'd start thinking that he's doing it on purpose.\n\nNTA at all.", "If he could leave and get sushi\u2026 why couldn\u2019t he get you what you originally asked for? NTA.", "NTA, Why didn't he pick up your original order of fried rice with steak? He sounds like my ex who when I came home from work one day had dinner ready. Huge shrimp cocktail and rice with celery soup dumped on it. I looked at him and said you've got to be kidding me. I got sick on shrimp when I was a kid and can't eat it as it makes me gag. I'd told him he knew I didn't eat shrimp. He got all pissy and said I didn't appreciate when he tried to do something nice. That was just another log on the fire that was our marriage burning up. I separated from him two weeks later.", "Does your husband hate you? Nta", "Weaponised incompetence. NTA", "NTA I'll bet cashy money your husband is doing this on purpose.

You had emotions which is perfectly okay and normal. \n\nNTA. \n\nI know how you feel. I once had a really rough day and missed lunch and had a long commute. On the phone with my husband on my drive home, he told me he was making Chicken Parmesan. I love Chicken Parmesan. I got home and he had made breaded baked chicken with plain white rice. No pasta. No marinara sauce. No melts cheese. I cried. Literally I was just in tears. Tired. Hangry. Stressed. Disappointed. He was confused. He said \u201cthere is Parmesan in the breading. I grated it myself\u201d.", "NTA this isn\u2019t so much about the action- it\u2019s about the message it sent, that he doesn\u2019t listen to you and doesn\u2019t care about your preferences. \n\nYour explosion was likely fueled by the hunger and bad day but the true spark there was the underlying feeling of not being valued and not being heard. \n\nDoes he act like this often where he disregards your preferences or doesn\u2019t listen?", "NTA but something feels amiss. Is there potentially some learned helplessness, passive aggressive commentary on your dietary choices/health, and/or any history of controlling behavior going on here?", "You think it was nice of him to share his rice?  He should have insisted you get every last grain of his rice so you had something to eat. In fact, he should have given you his whole order and let you eat whatever you wanted from it. Then, he should have placed the correct order while you were eating his food.   \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut does he by chance like shrimp?", "Careful OP you're gonna get a lot of redditors calling for divorce over this one. \n\nNTA. Would you be annoyed if your partner got as angry as you did over a mistake? I don't know your relationship so I won't be able to tell you, but usually if I'm not sure of how my partner is thinking I put myself in their shoes to see if the roles were reversed, how I would react.", "NTA", "Nah. A partner is supposed to be there on your worst days to offer support. This isn\u2019t support.

The first time, it could have been the restaurant who messed up the order (giving you someone else\u2019s entree by mistake for example), but the second time, you were very clear about what you didn\u2019t want \u2026 and he ignored you and has the nerve to be mad at you for not eating something you told him you did not want?!", "Maybe not worth getting pissed about, but damn, husband sounds like an idiot.\n\nI'll go with NTA.", "NTA.  Buy him some dog crap.", "You sound like one to me", "Info- if you didn\u2019t want to cook and were picking up the food why didn\u2019t you just order the food to avoid this issue?\n\nAnyway NAH. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being disappointed or frustrated but I do think to some extent you are misplacing your frustrations because you had an overall bad day, are tired and hungry. Operating under the assumption that him ordering the wrong food was a genuine accident (sounds sketchy because he ordered veggies and shrimp and you wanted rice and steak so if he\u2019s a health freak I would be inclined to think it was intentional but you didn\u2019t state that it was or you suspected it was so I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a genuine accident) then accidents happen I don\u2019t think he was deliberately trying to make your day worse and he probably felt bad and wanted to try to get you something he thought you would like. I see a lot of people asking why he didn\u2019t get what you originally ordered and I\u2019m going to assume it was further away than the sushi and he probably felt like that was a good compromise. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a bad day but I don\u2019t think he intentionally tried to make it worse for you which is why I\u2019m not calling him an AH either.", "NTA but you sound either stressed or immature, hard to say.

I was hungry and I didn\u2019t want the fish one! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c So I get it. was It\u2019s just such a clueless husband thing to do. If you think you went overboard and you yelled or called names, it would be nice to apologize for THAT part.

I called my husband on the way home and said I didn\u2019t feel like cooking so he said he\u2019d order something I could pick up on the way home. I asked him to order me FRIED RICE with STEAK. I get super excited as I\u2019ve had little to eat all day, so I pick up the food and finally get home to eat. I open it\u2026. And there is NO rice. NO steak. Instead, it\u2019s a container full of vegetables with shrimp. I don\u2019t even like shrimp. I was upset because how do you mess something up that bad? I did not yell or b*tch, I just said \u201cwhat is this?\u201d He knew he messed it up and got an attitude with ME!!! He said he could tell I was mad so it made him mad. Wtf? He sure got his own order right. \n\nHe offered to give me some of his rice which is nice but still\u2026 I was just so irritated. Admittedly, I was probably more mad than usual as I was so hungry and had had a bad day. He then asked me if I wanted him to go get shush I to make up for it and I said no, I don\u2019t want sushi. He then proceeds to leave the house and just came back with SUSHI. I DONT FREAKING WANT SUSHI. I know it\u2019s a nice thought but gd I literally said I didn\u2019t want it? Now he\u2019s all mad and confused about why I won\u2019t eat the sushi. I\u2019m fuming. I know it\u2019s not that big of a deal but I haven\u2019t felt this annoyed in a while. Now I\u2019m ignoring him so I don\u2019t snap. So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Does does he pull passive aggressive things like this when he is asked to do tasks (I\u2019d say it could be weaponized incompetence but usually that they at least attempt to look like they tried to do it right.)\n\nThis feels very passive aggressive and obnoxious- like he\u2019s picking other foods that start with S and are  about  the same length but very obviously not the right foods.\n\nI don\u2019t know if he\u2019d trying to weaponize his incompetence and he\u2019s just really incompetent at even that, if it\u2019s some obnoxious passive aggressive power trip type thing, if he was annoyed his wife didn\u2019t want to cook after working all day And was trying to punish her for Shirking what he saw as her responsibilities or if he\u2019s trying to put his wife on a diet without it actually being her choice but there is no way someone can mix up those orders and the fact that he went out to get other food and got food she repeatedly told him she DIDN\u2019T want cannot possibly be an accident. Whatever he did it was intentional.", "Because his only concern was himself. He didn't order food for OP, he had OP collect his food. Then he wanted sushi, so he went and got it.", "Of course he did it on purpose. It is a power play", "Doesn\u2019t sound like he messed it up. Sounds like he deliberately ordered a lower calorie meal for her. Which sounds like an AH move on the face of it. But I have seen a couple situations where that wasn\u2019t the case: (1) I was friends with a couple years ago. The gf wanted to go in a weight loss journey and asked bf to help her make healthy choices because she said she didn\u2019t have the willpower to do so. I felt bad for him because from everything I saw, he was definitely into health and fitness, but was super cautious about talking a lot about that when she was around because she was heavier and he didn\u2019t want her to feel pressured or bad about her body. We were friends for a while so I saw them order from opposite ends of the spectrum when out and make very different meal choices when hanging out at home, but i never once saw him suggest she change her choice or comment on her choices at all. He told me very specifically that he never wanted her to feel like she had to eat the way he did so he was very careful not to comment on her choices or make faces or have a tone because she was *hyper* sensitive to everyone else\u2019s body size and eating habits. If any of us ordered something healthier than her at like a movie or something, she was always the one putting herself down about it. Anyway, I saw her react the same way OP did though\u2014asked him to keep her on track, specifically cited that he should ignore her when she didn\u2019t order off the low cal menu at their takeout places, but flipped out when he brought up her request that he make her backpedal those kinds of orders. (2) morbidly obese guy recovering from weight related injury. Unable to get food himself. I know for a fact the couple met with a nutritionist and discussed her enabling him and the need to change that. But though they agreed that she should override his decisions sometimes, he got scary when in situations like the one OP described (like throwing things, damaging stuff angry when she brought him a grilled chicken salad instead of McNuggets).", "Who\u2019s to say the messed order wasn\u2019t the fault of the restaurant? Sure, I can see it being hubby\u2019s fault if he mistakenly ordered a different dish that OP would often order, but I can\u2019t see him intentionally ordering shrimp and veggies when he knows his wife doesn\u2019t like shrimp.", "One time in college I went to take a sip of my coke and got...milk!  I completely forgot that I had decided to get a glass of milk instead.  It was so trippy having a moment where my brain was like WTF (?!) because it took a few extra seconds to process what was actually happening.  Lol.  \ud83d\ude02", "Yes! But I was thinking of that sweet wonderful taste of Dr. Pepper and getting Diet Coke instead.", "Same. And sushi is also fairly low calorie and \u201calso has rice.\u201d", "You can't think of a single possible reason? Not one?", "My thoughts exactly", "A lot of Chinese takeout places use numbers to place orders because of the language barrier, he may have just said the wrong number. Giving him the benefit of the doubt but he's still the AH.", "Why didn't she check the food before she left the restaurant?  I, at the very least, would've checked the reciept to see if it was what I wanted.", "If they packed the wrong order he would have said so. When that happens to me I get annoyed and say \"oh shit. We've got to go back they gave us the wrong thing!?!!\". Not deadpan. Leave to get food she likes in apology and still come back with his preferred food.", "She said he ordered her shrimp, why would she be mad at him if the restaurant got the order wrong silly billy", "Op wrote HE messed up, not the restaurant.", "Or maybe he wanted shrimp and vegetables. And sushi.", "It doesn't sound likely that they packed the wrong order. Additionally, there's a receipt that lists what was ordered that told the tail and he was immediately projecting his guilt and defensiveness.", "Ordering food is so easy especially when the first time she picked it up not him, that weaponized incompetence seems unlikely cuz like why is just being the one to type in the order something you want to get out of doing? I agree the secret forcing her on a diet is more likely", "Latter* ladder is an object you use to reach high spaces", "Right sorry I thought you were specifically talking about this one! Thanks for clarification.", "Ah so comments for a completely different situation are different. I'm fucking shocked!", "Okay but then he went out and got sushi. That makes no sense. He either doesn't listen to her or he's incompetent.", "If the restaurant had messed it up *he* would have said so & taken it back to fix it instead of getting mad that she wasn't happy & then going to get *another* thing that she said that she didn't want. He's either not listening to her or just getting what he wants.", "that's irrelevant bc he went out and got something she specifically said she didn't want so at that point you gotta come around to thinking it's deliberate", "How does a restaurant send veggies and shrimp instead of rice and steak?", "This was my thought as well: who messed up the order, hubby or the restaurant? Because that is a BIG factor.", "The first one might be on the restaurant the second one was fully on him", "Or you could just pay the slightest bit of attention and get your gf what she asked for instead of getting the wrong thing TWICE, especially after she specifically said no to the second thing.", "Exactly!! If he's going out anyway, get the stuff she wanted in the first place!", "She even said that she didn't want sushi and he got it as the replacement anyway. WTH? It's tough being tired and Hangry.", "\"Why are you mad that I didn't get you what you wanted? I literally went out and brought you sushi!\" \n\nI just...", "He ordered rice for himself. He 'just' wants to control her.", "Yup either this or he wanted her to eat a lower calorie meal.", ">Honestly this to me feels like he\u2019s trying to put her on a diet.\n\nThat's also messed up because Sushi isn't healthy at all. There's a lot of oils/rice. I wonder what's going on inside his head.", "My SO is often like this. Not about the food, but other purchases.   \nA coffee machine - I was telling him, what I want, and the most important part was a milk beholder, so it could automatically take needed amount of milk to make latte or cappucino. Or just a flexible tube,you can put straight into the milk carton.  \nWhat did I get?   \nCoffee machine with just a nozzle to frothing milk. EXACTLY this I've had in our old coffee machine! And it supposed to be my birthday present!   \nHe apologised and said, that this model had the best revievs. I don't care - I wanted ONE specific function and didn't get it.   \nHe said, that he'll go to the shop and exchange the machine for another model. But, unforunately, he put the bill somewhere, so we couldn't find it and  let it were. So now we have a coffe machine I hate to use and still drinking my instant coffee.   \nLately it was this cordless vacuum cleaner. We were both in a shop and just  casually were looking at different models, not exactly planning to buy one right now. I expressed very clearly again, what kind of these vacuum cleaners I'd like to have and which are a \"no-go\" for me, because they were very uncomfortable for me (those with the whole unit kept in hand and the stiff pipe).  \nGuess, what my dear SO brings home a few days later - yes, exactly this model I didn't want. What worse - not even with the charging unit, but with a separate battery, you have to charge and attache to it. \"Because I have already the charger and batteries, which we can use to this vacuumer\" . Double inconvenience :/. Yes, I get it it was cheaper because of it. But it happened just a couple of weeks before the Black Friday, so we could wait and get something in a good price and the other thing is - it supposed to be for me, because I hate vacuuming and was thinking about something easy to handle. We have a normal vacuum cleaner at home, were just looking for something \"handy\".  \nHim buying this complicated and uncomfortable vacuum cleaner didn't solve the problem for me at all.   \nI would buy this freaking vacuum cleaner myself - now I can't, \"because we already have one\". Sigh....", "this is such an unrelated anecdote i'm not sure why you took the time to type it out, honestly", "Wtf is this response? \ud83d\ude02 I swear some of the reaches y\u2019all will make on this sub to justify the weirdest behavior.", "And then, when he left to get more food after the restaurant messed it up supposedly, he *still* couldn't get what she wanted? He had to get *sushi?*\n\nThat doesn't check out. \n\nIt clearly has nothing to do with the restaurant messing up his order, unless he's claiming that two different restaurants messed up the same order 2 separate times on the same day, presumably within hours of each other.", "Oh no! That is such a far off taste from soda, yuck. Probably the worst combo yet! And yeah it's so funky how your brain takes a sec to connect the dots. \ud83d\ude05", "Haha yes! Or you think you are getting iced tea and it's soda. So gross.", "She cooks most of the time, did he think sushi and shrimp would make her drop a dress size in a night", "so then what happened when she said no to sushi and he got it anyway?", "Shrimp and veggies would likely not be adjacent to fried rice and steak on a menu though", "I thought that at first too that it was just a simple error until I got to the part about the sushi. Why didn\u2019t he go back to the original place and get what she wanted?", "She will from now on I'm sure of it.", "He can't secretly put her on a diet, she stated she's the one who cooks mostly but she was having a bad day... Is his idea of slimming his wife supplying her with copious amounts of seafood in a 3 hour sitting then business as usual lol", "Look, I asked a question. Because it happens a lot that person A draws a conclusion and person B panics. Calm communication works wonders, even when you\u2019re upset.\n\nHe might have been thinking she said no to sushi because she was mad and would say no to anything, even if she actually wanted it. He might have thought she\u2019d change her mind once she saw/smelled it. I\u2019m not in his head, I have no way of knowing.\n\nOdds are he screwed up. I know this. But I still ask the question because you never know. I once ordered chicken strips from Costco and ended up with a fuckin poutine. Things happen.", "She doesn\u2019t actually tell us what he said at all, aside from them both being mad.", "Seems this is one of those posts where a reasonable question like this is unpopular.", "That was my dark thought!!", "That\u2019s what I was wondering. He\u2019s trying to weirdly control her weight by ordering what he thinks she should eat instead of letting her make her own decisions like an adult. The whole situation is creepy especially getting the sushi when he could have just got the steak like she wanted.", "#12 and #21, maybe?", "if not that, what do you think he is doing? asking genuinely.", "She did communicate. Multiple times. He still did the exact opposite.", "He literally got mad that she was mad. He didn't go fix the order when he easily could have. He messed up & it's pretty clear when he kept not listening & yet could get what *he* wanted without a problem.", "Maybe that would be a valid point if he wasn\u2019t overly defensive about the \u2018mistake\u2019 and then went out to get something else that yevOP specifically said they *didn\u2019t* want. \n\nHe\u2019s either a complete idiot or he\u2019s doing it on purpose, and one would have to be a complete idiot oneself to excuse it as a simple mistake at that point.", "I think you missed the part where I said *calm* communication. None of this sounded like it was particularly calm.", "And isn\u2019t it weird to get mad instead of apologizing if it\u2019s your fuckup?", "Some people don't want to admit that they messed up. Instead, they get mad because the other person got mad at them for messing up. Not everyone owns up to their mess up's. Normally, people who weren't wrong would call the restaurant & take it back to get the correct order since they didn't get what they paid for. Going out to get something he quite literally was told no about instead of getting the correct order is a big clue that *he* messed up & isn't listening to her.", "I\u2019m just going to go back to, I asked a question. It\u2019s a pretty simple question. Sure we can all think we know the answer, but we don\u2019t. I said elsewhere, was it probably his screwup? Yeah. But I just wanted to ask if that was something that was actually stated or just an assumption.\n\nI\u2019ve taken a peek at OP\u2019s comment history and their marriage seems to be having some issues. So I\u2019d venture a guess that this whole thing is more complex than a fucked up food order.\n\nIt\u2019s been fun, but unless OP answers my question, I\u2019m out."]}
