He may be refusing treatment because he wants to do things on his own terms, as he always has. That's his prerogative, but don't make the mistake of being sanctimonious, because there are no guarantees. I've always lived a clean life - exercised, never smoked, ate well.

And he didn\u2019t live as \u201cunhealthily as he could\u201d - it\u2019s quite unusual for someone of his Baby Boomer generation to never have been a heavy smoker? Hell, he probably faced a decent amount of teasing from his peers for not drinking heavily. \n\nIllegal drugs also exist. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want this to sound patronising but you will learn as you grow and age that being healthy is tough. If you think you\u2019re making all perfect choices then good for you, but you might find you were wrong and habits are hard to break. For a good chunk of his life your grandfather would have had the concrete understanding that sugar, salt and fat were vital, healthy things. At some point when he was in his 30s or 40s, the thinking changed. \n\n\nAnyway it sounds like he lived on his terms and is comfortable with the outcome.

Otherwise, being cruel to a dying man because he didn't eat enough veg to earn \"deserves some family member around to talk to\" is weird. He's 78. Statistically he was going to be dying soon regardless of what he ate or if he went to the gym. If he's worthy of love, it's gross to make it contingent on healthy habits. He'll be dead soon.\n\nHealthy habits also don't create people who just definitely spontaneously drop dead or die in their sleep with no family care. If he's an annoying old bastard, he would be so if he lived very healthfully. \n\nFwiw I have done palliative care for a relative 3 times, the first at 16. It is horrible.

Being a caretaker of elderly dying man is not your job. Visiting to keep him company here and there is nice, but absolutely no one should expect this of you.

Hopefully you inherited his good genes that kept him going despite his lifestyle. Unless he was an abusive awful grandparent, take a turn. Ask him for stories from his childhood to pass the time. He will be gone soon enough and you will hopefully have a happy memory. Actual caretaking should be done by an adult.

He does not get to demand that his family give up their daily lives to care for him.\n\nBut your judgement of him \"doing it to himself\" is just wrong.  78 is a good innings; US male life expectancy is currently 77.28 years so he's already beat that.  And everyone dies.  Eat all the healthy food you want, exercise as much as you like, but you aren't getting out of life alive.  And it is his choice to decline medical care knowing that the alternative is dying, and it is absolutely his right to choose to die at home, in his own bed, with his family around him.  Dying is not the character flaw you are making it out to be.  \n\nHis selfishness at expecting his family to drop everything for him is, however.  By all means visit him, sit with him, but the nursing work should be carried out by trained staff who know how to bathe, toilet and turn a bedbound patient  without injury to the patient or themselves."]}
