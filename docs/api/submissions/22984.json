Go hangout with your friends and enjoy your childhood. Before you know it you are going to wake up to a job, responsibilities, and the best part of your day will be when you find time to take a nap. You are not a doctor, nurse, or other caregiver and that is absolutely not your responsibility. He made his bed and can lie in it.\n\nThe only thing I will say is think about how you will feel in the future if you don\u2019t spend time with him now. I\u2019m sort of jaded because my grandfather on my dads side never really had anything to do with us so now that he\u2019s dying I\u2019m not there spending time with him very often. But I would give anything to spend more time with my grandfather on my moms side who passed away a few years ago. Ultimately it\u2019s your decision to make.", "INFO\n\nExactly what will this end of life caretaking entail? Because from what I've learned, it takes professional help. As in, all of you will be in over your head with this end of life caretaking.", "INFO: are you refusing to engage and visit at all, or refusing to be his carer? Or somewhere in the middle?\n\nAnd how long is he expecting this treatment?\n\nNot enough clarity in your post for judgement.", "Question- are you cutting him out of your life, or just refusing to play nursemaid?", "I mean it kinda depends what he asks for. But a good portion probably should be done by an actual professional care giver lol. That being said if he\u2019s asking you for like water and a chat is it all that much for you to do?", "Nta. But here\u2019s the problem. In 10 or 20 years will you regret not spending time with him while he does? You don\u2019t have to agree with his choices. You don\u2019t have to like his choices. But at the end of the day\u2026when he\u2019s gone he\u2019s gone.", "I just want to know how you know he\u2019s never exercised past 19 and always ate fast food his entire life?", "NTA he made poor life choices and your life and your relatives lives don't revolve around him. He cannot expect people to attend to him 24/7", "Wait, does he actually want family to nurse him or just like\u2026 be around him and keep him company? Because expecting your family to be 24/7 hospice is a LOT and pretty unfair but expecting them to be present is not. You\u2019re a massive asshole for refusing to be around him because he made unhealthy choices. He\u2019s 78. That\u2019s an above average lifespan. Plenty of people who love healthy die younger. Sounds like you\u2019re just a baby who doesn\u2019t want to put in the basic effort of comforting a loved one and wants to think up so some lame excuse why.", "If he can live till 78 with just fast food/ soda / no exercise, that is impressive. I understand he is wrong for denying professional caretaker. However, he is right to ask her relatives to spend time and talk to him. You are a pure AH for failing to express any empathy.", "ESH. Because he is refusing professional care giving, I worry that he will abuse it by forcing you and others to do medical care that no one is trained or ready to do. Plus, it\u2019s selfish of him to put that physical and mental strain of caregiving on his family when he has other options.\n\nHowever, I do think that if he is able to respect boundaries, you should sit down and lay them out: you can visit and chat, maybe make him some food and share a meal and play cards. Something like that. But you will do NO care giving beyond that. If you lay out your terms and they refuse, then N T A for refusing.\n\nI have family who work in health care and one is a home care nurse. That stuff is NOT easy, and can add onto the stress that a grieving family already has. So please be mindful of boundaries.", ">grandfather (78?M) who spent most of his life living basically as unhealthily as he could. Ate mostly fast food for his whole life, drinks only soda, and did no exercise past the age of about 19.\n\nAt the ripe old age of 78, I don't think any of those things you listed are the cause for his ill health/pending earth! He has lived almost 60 years past his last exercise, so you sound a bit silly to be blaming it on those things. \n\nHe has the right to ask, everyone has a choice to agree to his wishes or not. You're also young, and you don't sound particularly close to him. Let others decide what they want to do.", "I kinda think YTA here, tbh.\n\nYour grandfather should accept some caregiver support from people other than family, if he has specific needs. It's not fair of him to absolutely insist on having the family do it all. It's hard.\n\nOn the other hand, you're unnecessarily judgemental. He may be refusing treatment because he wants to do things on his own terms, as he always has. That's his prerogative, but don't make the mistake of being sanctimonious, because there are no guarantees. I've always lived a clean life - exercised, never smoked, ate well. And I just got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, at 40. \n\nYou won't have your grandfather for long. You're unlikely to regret spending time with him while you can. He's lived to a good age despite the lifestyle choices you're judging him for, and now he's probably scared and lonely. Be a good person, but encourage him to accept proper nursing care if he needs it.", "YTA!!! Read your Text again. Slowly and twice. I hope you then notice how disgustingly disrespectful you are towards someone probably very close to you who isn't there for much longer. When he's gone, he's gone and you are going to live a life full of regret for not taking care of him (At least give him attention!). Who the hell cares what choices he made in his life! He's your grandpa! Im gonna assume he loves you very much so show him some gratitude aswell, don't be a heartless brat.", "YTA. At 78, he lived a long life and seemed to have some fun doing it. OP, do you live like some kind of monk? Who are you to judge? You\u2019re a real brat.", "YTA. So you do not want him to die in peace. I assume that you are perfect since you find fault with him. He's better off without you.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think your grandfather expects you to do the majority of his nursing care.  He just wants to see you. For him hospice seems likes the best option once he qualifies. Also OP 76 is a pretty old age so I wouldn\u2019t be too high and mighty about lifestyle. You will meet people with healthy lifestyles who die young and others that smoke like chimneys and drink like fish that live till 90", "NTA. I was about to say no one was the asshole cause while your grandfather lived his life the way he wanted, it's how he wanted to go. However, now that he requires constant care he should either have *willing* family members do that or pay for a damn caretaker. Caring for the dying can be mentally and physically straining. That's not something someone should do unless they are 100% down for it, much less a child! A lot of people having dying wishes, doesn't mean you're obligated to fulfill them all.", "INFO: Do you like your grandfather?", "It's not his fault he's dying, all that shit about his diet is really gross.\n\nIt IS his fault to expect someone be there at all times to babysit without getting paid for it. Spending time with him is different from taking care of him\n\nEsh", "I can\u2019t believe the NTA. Oh wait, yea I can because this sub is full of bratty teenagers. I hope when you\u2019re dying your grandkids dip on spending time with you because of some petty shit.", "YTA.\n\nUnless there is more to your situation that you are not revealing, the man is dying.  He is frightened, and he is feeling vulnerable and does not want to die alone or die with strangers.  \n\nHe needs to feel connection with his family now.  It won't be long.  Even if he did not take care of himself, he would still die.  One day you will also be in his place, and most likely you will want family near you.  Unless he has done something to wound you, what he is asking for does not sound like too much, especially if this is being shared among family members.\n\nOne day you will probably feel ashamed of yourself for your selfish attitude.", "Yta.  None of us is going to beat the clock.  When it\u2019s your time, you will probably want some comfort and compassion too.", "YTA.  Your attitude is contemptible", "YTA - you are still a child and maybe don\u2019t have the emotional intelligence yet. But it\u2019s absolutely okay for your grandad to live the life he lived and still deserve love on his deathbed. You didn\u2019t say he was a bad person or did illegal things. \n\nIf your parents are happy to help then that\u2019s great for him! Your parents are lovely. You are just being a spoilt and judgmental brat.", "YTA. Not for refusing to take care of him but for blaming him. Blaming the sick to get away from being involved in their suffering is horrible that's what makes them feel ashamed on top of their guilt of letting themselves and their loved ones down and makes their grief all the more complicated.\nAlso for your knowledge his condition could be caused by other factors and for a male to live past 78 with the habits you believe he had (judging by your age it's certainly hearsay) it's impressive.\nI think you're doing that because you can't think of a reasonable excuse to get out of it and you don't want to seem selfish but really you're free to refuse respectfully don't make it more complicated than it is, your parents are at fault for pressuring you into doing it even though you expressed your reluctance and guilt tripping you, he's still your grandfather so when he eventually dies it'll be even more difficult for you.", "Seriously?  I hope when YOU die, your people don\u2019t walk away because it\u2019s your fault you\u2019re dying. \n\nYou will forever regret your insensitivity. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Not wanting to help him, because in your opinion, he lived an unhealthy lifestyle, is pretty selfish and callous.\n\nYou are in no way obligated to be his 24/7 end of life caretaker, but I\u2019d at least go see him one last time and be there for him in some capacity.

Both of my parents died at home and we had a lot of family helping them. However, hospice is a great necessity.
