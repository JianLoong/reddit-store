That action might make me the asshole because my partner and I are long distance but are moving in together soon. I never felt comfortable enough to let him drive my car but once we move in together that is something that I would have to be comfortable with since we\u2019ll be in the same house. Since we are moving in together, I started thinking that the least I could do is share my car with him but he thinks I am selfish for finally allowing him to drive my car after 2 years of dating.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You may want to check if your insurance will pay for accidents while your car is driven by uncovered drivers, that may make an easy solution for you.", "Hard to tell on this one without additional information but it's your car and if you haven't got insurance covering additional drivers then I think that's fair enough. Unless he has an abundance of money and can cover your car and third parties if any accidents did happen, I wouldn't really trust him as that can be very expensive.\n\nSo without additional info, NTA I guess.", "INFO: Has he been in many accidents?", "Is he paying for the car and insurance?  If the answer is no then he can go suck a lemon.  There is a lot of potential liability if he fucks up and may end up all on you.", "NTA your car your insurance your responsibility. He is not entitled to use your car.", "ESH, You should not have let him drive the first time he was reckless", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Has he had any crashes? I'm going to say NTA because it *is* your car, but I wonder if you should rethink the relationship when you can't ride peacefully with your bf.", "being a good driver is all about how other people feel when they are driving, if you are unsafe with his driving then he is a shit driver. Make sure you tell him this next time he asks to drive YOUR car, cause it is not his decision and you need to put ur foot down. Dont give in.", "NTA but also why would he drive your car with you in it? I\u2019m also between cars rn and I borrow my bf\u2019s car about once a week but I don\u2019t drive it with him inside because it\u2019s *his car*.", "Not the asshole your car your rules if he can\u2019t handle it he can walk!!

If he drove my car like he had some sense today then maybe I would be a little more comfortable letting him drive more often. The previous time he drove my car months ago, I was in the car with him and he drove recklessly which led to me not letting him drive my car again until today", "I don\u2019t have coverage for additional drivers and he does not have a lot of money to help get it fixed if he wrecks it. If he were to wreck it, the cost would be mostly on me or I would have to wait for him to save up the money.", "He hasn\u2019t had any accidents on his own car (that was towed almost a year ago and still hasn\u2019t gotten back) but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t or won\u2019t get into an accident. They\u2019re called \u201caccidents\u201d for a reason", "He doesn\u2019t pay for anything. Not even gas although I drive us everywhere.

Is he like this in other aspects of the relationship bc honestly it's somewhat of a red flag.", "If he wants to drive like an idiot he can get his own car.

If he doesn\u2019t take care of the car he has, he won\u2019t take care of yours.  A car is a tool. You need that tool for work, shopping and life in general.  NTA.

But I'm going slight YTA for being a backseat driver. If you do lend him your car, then you have to let him drive.", "I don\u2019t seen it as being a backseat driver when he\u2019s sweating in and out of lanes, doing almost 100 in a 65 During rush hour, and speeding in parking lots all while a child is in the backseat. I\u2019m not wrong for asking him to slow down a little bit.", "A backseat driver is a passenger that's giving unwanted advice to the driver. That is, if he doesn't want your advice, then you are a backseat driver. It has nothing to do with wether your advice is reasonable or not.", "My thing is, I don\u2019t care if he wants my advice. If he\u2019s driving my car recklessly I will speak up.", "Yeah, backseat driving or not, it doesn't make you an asshole for telling someone they're making you feel unsafe.  Especially if major laws are being broken!  Especially Especially not in your own vehicle!  And Especially x 3 with a child involved!!"]}
