I could write a really long novel about all the things that have transpired.\n\nMy boyfriend has volunteered for 20 year old to move across the country into my house that I own to live with me and my kids. He lives here too, but his work takes him away from home for about 10 months of each year in total. 20 year old is fully aware of this. Being that his kids are so far away, I can count the number of times I have spent time with them on one hand, and understandably, they have never really felt much desire to talk to me otherwise. So, we don\u2019t know each other all that well. \n\nI told him I think it is a terrible idea, as I don\u2019t want drinking and edibles going on in my house or someone coming in late. I also don\u2019t want her bringing strangers into my house and around my kids as she starts meeting new people. I get that these are normal things at her age, so I\u2019m not trying to make her seem like a bad person, I just don\u2019t want it in my house. I have been working for years on my ability to set boundaries and enforce them, but I\u2019m still terrible at it because it still gives me anxiety and I\u2019m conflict avoidant. I know I am going to need to get better at this anyway since the teenage years are looming ahead for my brood, but I worry that I am not up to this task presently and she is going to turn my home and my life upside down and be a negative influence on my kids who, understandably, think she is the coolest. \n\nWhen I informed him of this he hung up on me and in the days since, the sum total of our communication has been him asking if I\u2019ve thought about it anymore or if I\u2019m still making it all about me.

What school is she going to sign up for? He\u2019s dumping this not quite adult child onto you. He\u2019s the hero to his ex and his daughter- with you doing all the work. It\u2019s not all about you - it\u2019s also about your kids and what is best for them.  If you start to feel bad or guilty about setting boundaries, get into Mama Bear mode and stick to your proverbial guns FOR YOUR CHILDREN. Saying no does not and will not make you an AH. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s the most amazing man on the planet. He\u2019s not worth your home-life comfort and peace of mind and your children\u2019s welfare. Be strong. You can do this.", "NTA it\u2019s about your family not just you.  She hasn\u2019t demonstrated an ability to follow her mother\u2019s rules why would she follow yours.", "NTA.  It is your home, he is rarely there, no way is his 20yr old daughter moving in with you.  She is not your responsibility.  This is your hill to die on!  Do not let him manipulate you into letting his daughter move in, he isn't there to deal with her, you will be stuck with dealing with all the problems she causes.", "NTA- She certainly won\u2019t respect you if she doesn\u2019t respect her mother. I could MAYBE see a situation where your boyfriend could have a say in this debate if he was your husband and owned the house too. But he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s yours.", "NTA\nNeither of her parents want to parent her. So bf looks at the nearest available woman to abdicate all the load onto.", "NTA. \n\nIf he changes his job so he's present to parent 7 days a week then yes, I would allow it. Otherwise he's not there and she's not your daughter, plus she's an adult. She can rent her own student place!\n\nDefinitely a hill to die on, don't back down!", "NTA. Your bf just wants to dump her on you so he doesn't have to deal with her. What a loser.", "NTA - this is not your monkey! She needs to stay out of your circus. Your home, your much younger children - if he\u2019s insisting that it\u2019s his \u201cright\u201d to offer her housing, then he needs to be providing it. Not you.", "Simple solution...my house, my rules.", "No is a complete answer and requires no additional explanation or reasoning. This is your house, this is your life, this is your decision. If he brings it up again tell him that his things have been packed and they are in the garage waiting for him to come pick them up because you're sure that he will want to get an apartment that he can live in with his 20 year old hell child. If her own mother can't tolerate her, you are certainly not going to be able to. NTA.", "NO NO NOOO NTA! Her mother doesn\u2019t want her! Why should you? I think you should ditch your boyfriend too!", "If he wants her to live with him, than range for her to live wherever he does 10 mo of the year, and offer RENT for her presence int he OPs him the other 2 mo. But NO WAY IN HELL should  OP be hosting this 20 yr old in her home.  Her DAD needs to be there AND PAYING RENT for this girl (just like a random kid in college would pay for a room if they were staying in OPs home- because that is what this is). BUT ONLY the 2 mo he is also in the home.  \n\nDie on this hill- and accept that your relationship is likely over- and that is a GOOD THING.  Your BF is a selfish AH, and now you know why he is divorced.  You deserve better.  And I know being alone is scary and hard for many folks- but being alone will be EASIER and financially better for you than being with this...person who is not a partner. And who knows- by dumping this bad baggage, you might find a partner in truth.", "Bf seems a little too cozy with OP's time and money.", "<<live wherever he does 10 mo >>\n\nHe could be a long distance trucker--there is no indication that the ten months are spent in the same location."]}
