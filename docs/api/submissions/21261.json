It was my fault, pretty much. She was put on bed rest for severe edema and I let my emotions surrounding her pregnancy complications get the best of me. I was still working but my performance was severely impacted because I couldn't get out of my own head (she was almost hospitalized and I was so afraid to leave her home alone). \n\nWell, she was just given the go ahead to get off bed rest but advised to take it easy. Thankfully my sister has been letting us stay here but for the first month, we were living out of our car. Since she's been off bed rest, she's been a bit.. bitchy. It's definitely due to the complications with the pregnancy but she's just very hard to be around right now. Every single day she's complaining about something and this week it's her cat. When we became homeless, I essentially \"made her\" get rid of her cat. I paid someone to take my dog but we couldn't find a single person to foster her cat and we couldn't keep the cat in the vehicle with us because she wasn't supposed to be around a cat box. So she had to give up her 7 year old cat and she never let me live it down. She was never a fan of my dog. She has said multiple times that it's not fair that she had to give up her 7yo cat that she bottle fed (she found the cat when he was like maybe a day old because momma cat abandoned it) while I still get to keep my \"rat dog\". She's just never liked my dog and hates her more now since the cat issue.\n\nWell, last night I found her crying in the bathroom and I asked what was wrong. She was actually calm but she goes \"I'm going to be stuck in a house with a dog I fucking hate and my cats out there somewhere wondering why I abandoned him. It's not fair at all.\" Now.. this came on because I found us a place and we move in next week and she says it's not the same because she won't have her cat. So I kind of snapped because I'm tired of her getting on me about my dog and her cat and said \"how about I just get the place for me and my dog and you don't come?\" I then walked out and just left with my dog to cool off. Well, when I got home, her vehicle was gone and she had blocked me off everything. My sister says I'm a fucking AH because my fianc\u00e9 has every right to feel the way she does and says I've always acted like I put my dog first (telling her she had to get rid of her cat but paid people to take my dog so I could keep her).", "created_utc": 1688413373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14psp9v/aita_for_saying_i_will_just_get_a_place_for_me/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry, but if she has just an inch of spine, you'll be paying child support when the baby comes.", "YTA.   \nYou f\\*cked up on every step of this. Literally nothing you did right.", "YTA. \n\nShe is having health issues and pregnancy complications, you dropped the ball with housing and then instead of getting rid of both animals, you chose to not only keep the dog she can't stand, but also paid for someone to keep the dog. And then you ended your relationship with the comment about getting a place for just you and the dog. Funny enough, you didn't even include your impending child in that statement, let alone your partner. Just you and the dog. Again, you ended your own relationship and likely any chance you have of having your child more than every other weekend.", "YTA\n\nI think she's better off if you do just what you said.", "YTA to the nth degree.\n\nYOU caused you and your pregnant partner to be evicted.  YOU saved your dog, which the mother of your future child does not like, but got rid of her seniorish cat?

Wow.  \n\nI feel so very bad for your GF, stuck with you as the father of her child, thus stuck with you in her life for the next 18 year (unless you decide to be a deadbeat, which would not be surprising considering you put your dog over the mother of your child.\n\nDo her a favor...FIND her cat.

I can't imagine how awful a husband and father you will be.", "YTA. Actually you get the award for the biggest one I've seen today.

She is literally growing a human inside of her, a process that could kill her.  It will change her body and destroy it in ways that can never be fixed...  Being on bedrest means she's at a higher risk for problems, yet you're acting like this process is a mute point that has nothing to do with the situation at hand... your feelings about your dog seem to matter more than everything going on with her. \n\nShe has been homeless while dealing with one of the most complicated processes the human body can perform.

She feels resentment. You cannot snap at her like that when you forced her to do something. Secondly, she is pregnant with your child and as you said you became homeless due to your problems.

I got my animals when I could afford to take care of them.", "YTA - Definitely for what you said. I mean she was on bed rest and relying on you. You completely dropped the ball and you guys became homeless because of it. She had to live out a car while pregnant and give up her cat. Most people would have a problem with this and be emotional about having to give up their cat that they literally bottle fed to keep alive, but she's pregnant on top of it so extra hormones and stress. She was in her right to say what she said to you. But not only those things, while homeless you decide it was a good idea to pay someone to keep your dog. Like it would have been one thing to find someone that would be willing to keep him for free and that's how you kept the dog. But the dog was so important to you that you paid money , that you didn't have because you were homeless, so that you could keep your dog. But you got upset and told her you are going to abandon her like you did the cat (that's basically what you said and probably how she took it)because she was crying and saying how it's unfair you have your dog and she doesn't have her cat. You are an asshole.", "YTA. Your foot met your mouth pretty fast.", "Wow.\n\nYTA. And not doing very well in adulting, either.", "Wow. YTA.", "YTA and hope you realize this was it. You lost her and it's completely your fault. Again, by the way. She wouldn't have been homeless if it wasn't for you according to your own words. Which means she wouldn't have lost her cat.", "What did I just read?? Mega YTA.", "Yta so ypur dumb ass made her homeless, you paid for *your* dog's care but not her cat's, she still fucking sick as hell, AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GET HER CAT BACK??????\n\ngood, i hope she stays gone. You add nothing of value to her life.", "YTA \n\nYou probably should reflect on why your wife missing her cat triggered you so much that you want to not live with her. It\u2019s not normal or healthy for an adult to make threats of moving out during a fight. As an adult you say someone your really better mean it.", "YTA, she's right, you do value the dog more than her. I hope she leaves you.", "It would have been nice for you to comfort your partner in her sadness. This is a loss for her. Tell her you\u2019re a sorry but you did the best you could. You made it sound like she\u2019s the afterthought and you\u2019d throw her away too.", "You\u2019re gonna have Reddit out with the torches and pitchforks for the cat thing alone.", "ESH, you definitely need to treat her better and be more empathetic to her situation, she lost basically a member of her family, and I'm a little sus on the fact that someone would take a dog but no one could keep a cat, even with pay, but she definitely doesn't get to shit on your dog and tell you how much she hates him and always has (because honestly you probably wouldn't be with her at this point if she pointed out her hatred of him at the beginning of the relationship). \n\nI hope you can find some common ground and talk things out, but if not, prepare to be a good father outside of the relationship. Don't you dare get rid of your pet to make her feel better. That solves nothing.", "NTA you tried to find a way to keep the cat but truth is finding someone to foster a cat is much harder than finding someone to foster a dog. Pregnant or not she can\u2019t constantly degrade you and talk down to you then expect you to do whatever she says. She needs to grow up and learn that life doesn\u2019t always go as planned. You found a place for your family and she shit on it. I\u2019d have said the same thing. (And before y\u2019all come for me I am a woman and a mother))", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
