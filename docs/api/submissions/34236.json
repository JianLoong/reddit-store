He has been friends with his female best friend for about 3 years. They both have a similar background in terms of trauma, depression etc, and have both been struggling a lot this past year. They\u2019ve formed a bond over it throughout their friendship and this year specifically they have been each other\u2019s go-to call when they are feeling unsafe to be alone. I have always felt a little bit jealous that he has another female person in his life who he is so deeply connected with, since that is something we have never connected over, but I never acted on those jealous feelings because I know there is nothing wrong with having a close female friend. She also has a boyfriend who she lives with of about 2 years. \n\nIn September, this friend asked my boyfriend to go on a 3 week cruise across Europe with her in May 2024, and initially I was very uncomfortable with it but he convinced me I need to trust him (which I do) and that there should be no issue with him going. So they booked it, and now I am starting to feel really uncomfortable about it again, which we have been fighting about for the past week or so. His friend is aware of this and he told me she offered to talk to me to make me feel more comfortable with it, which did not help. I should note I have never met her.\n\nRight now my boyfriend and I are on vacation together, which she knows. Tonight at about 1am she texted my boyfriend to ask if they could call because she is going through some stuff right now. He left our bedroom and they talked for 2 hours. \n\nI told my boyfriend this really bothered me because she is aware that we are having issues regarding her right now, and she knows we are on vacation. I said she should have called her boyfriend instead, and it bothers me that she would rather call my boyfriend instead of her own. \n\nMy boyfriend says that she didn\u2019t want to bother her boyfriend because he was at a sleepover with friends, which is a rare thing for him to do. He says that he is honoured that she feels comfortable calling him and she had no other choice but to call him, otherwise she may have harmed herself. He says that in friendships this is what you do, and he would never not want her to call him when she is in a situation like that. I told him that she had other people she could have called and in our current circumstances it seems like a strange thing to do. He says he doesn\u2019t like who I am right now because he thought I would be more caring about her circumstances. \n\nAITA for being uncomfortable with this friendship?\n\nEdit: I should note that they both have dealt with and are dealing with severe depression", "created_utc": 1704277364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xg7hm/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_boyfriends/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A 3 week vacation with another woman while he\u2019s in a 5 year relationship? \n\nIt just sounds like she\u2019s a side chick looking for a promotion and you\u2019ve got your head buried in the sand.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesn't want to bother her boyfriend because he's on a sleepover with friends. So instead she calls YOUR boyfriend who is on a sleep over with YOU?!\n\nShe sounds cray cray. Is she trying on purpose to screw up your vacation? Because it sure sounds like it. She KNOWS that a middle-of-the-night call is disruptive, because she knows enough not to do it to her boyfriend. \n\nHas she thought about how a sleep-deprived boyfriend will affect you and your vacation? Has your boyfriend? This is such bullshit.", "Info: how many vacation time he has? Cause 3 weeks will be basically ALL and plus my summer vacation this means potentially I could spend 0 time of vacation with my partner.

I love my bestie but we would get bored if we were stuck on a ship together for 3. Whole. Weeks. That's a relationship trip, not a friend trip unless its a group of friends.\n\n\n\n2. He told her you guys were fighting about her. That's a huge fucking red flag. Back in college my bestie had a gf who got insecure about our friendship at one point. He didn't tell me until they broke up a few years later. I had no clue, they figured it out between themselves which is how respectful relationships should work. \n\n\n\n3. She offered to deal with you for him like you're a problem. The other huge red flag. I would have just backed off and questioned if you have a valid reason to be concerned, which she's not doing because she doesn't respect your relationship. \n\n\n\n4. The \"I'm suicidal and you need to talk me out of it right now in the middle of the night while you're supposed to be spending quality time with your gf\" is fucking deliberate and gross. It's attention seeking. She did it on purpose. \n\n\nYou have a boyfriend problem. Either he knows what's up or he's DUMB. Like painfully pathetically dumb. You will always have drama in your life if you're with a man who doesn't shut down women who try to fuck with your relationship. \n\nI would tell them they can have each other and bounce.", "NTA\n\nHer behaviour and your boyfriend's for that matter are not OK.

He was always texting, and I'd go onto WhatsApp and click on her profile as as soon as he finished texting, she would come online. Then vice versa. Turns out, he was the boyfriend and he was cheating on me.\n\nPlease be careful and dont let them take advabtage of your kind heart. Their behaviour seems very shady and I wouldn't be comfortable with them going on vacation together. It's weird!", "NTA, this guy has some serious \u26bd\ufe0f.

Even proposing something like this is unimaginable.\nI really would not be surprised that he is cheating. What is the boyfriend of the girl saying. Isn\u2019t he bothered by the fact that his girlfriend is going to vacation with another dude ?? In my eyes the guy does not give a single fuck about his relationship and is trying to make you end it , lame i know", "NTA. It doesn't sound like an emergency if she has the option to call her bf but just doesn't want to bother him. She's choosing to bother your bf, and he's flattered by it. Both are completely dismissive of your feelings. You don't seem to be your bf's priority here. \n\nWhy aren't you invited on this cruise? Sounds like a serious emotional affair going on.", "NTA sorry to say though, sounds like you and her boyfriend are side characters in the love story of your boyfriend and this woman\u2026 They sound like they want to end up with each other", "Your boyfriend is emotionally cheating with this girl, whether he means to or not. NTA and I would really consider whether this is a relationship you really want to continue since you appear to be second fiddle to his bestie.", "NTA, sounds like the classic 'friend they tell you not to worry about'. She is actively sabotaging your relationship.. you've never met this supposed best friend of 3 years, and she's taking your boyfriend on a cruise?? And then interrupting your holiday with him as well. I'd say in most relationships this would be multiple boundaries crossed", "NTA. They are cheating on you honey, tell your bf to fuck off, he's being disrespectful as hell.", "NTA. I understand that yes you can have friends of the opposite sex but your boyfriend should not be going to another woman when he is feeling sad he should be going to YOU! And she should be going to her boyfriend for comfort, not yours! Its more than justified being uncomfortable by this.\n\nDo you have any guy mates? If so it\u2019s time to book a 3 week holiday with one of them. I guarantee your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t be too happy with you giving all of your attention to another man.", "Doesn't want to bother her boyfriend has he's on a sleepover.

Your boyfriend needs to get his priorities straight. \n\nThey should both be investing more effort and energy into their relationships with their loving partners before confiding in each other \"as friends\".

He needs to step away from her and grow up.", "NTA\n\nA new \"best friend\" in 3 years while you are together. Something isn't right here and you know it. Time to stand up for yourself. Don't allow yourself to be treated like a doormat. Your boyfriend has his priorities all wrong.

If he insists on doing this then you have your answer about where he sees your relationship.\n\nIf I were you, and you think this 21 y.o. guy is worth the effort, I'd have a serious and firm talk and lay out your boundaries. If that doesn't work then cut your losses and dump him. He's being very immature and I suspect that his motivations aren't entirely innocent - at the very least he enjoys the attention - this reliance on him boosts his ego and he's playing you for a fool. Sorry, and good luck. Don't settle for mediocre - at 21 y.o you have the world in front of you. Don't accept this.", "You are already the side chick in this relationship.

Oh, sorry, a third choice is to peace out. I've been where you are - let's just say I opted with 1 and it didn't end well for me. When a friends feelings of comfort come before yours, something is very, very wrong.\n\nNTA in the least.", "If she is soooo unsafe that she has to call this often under these circumstances, maybe she should be in a psychiatric facility. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Maybe he's not cheating physically (yet), but he definitely does it emotionally.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is showing you who his priority is, and unfortunately it isn\u2019t you.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to accept this. To many people this would be a relationship breaker, and if he is unwilling to change his behaviour then you are fully justified in leaving.", "I have had many male best friends in my life, some of which I've travelled solo with whilst one or both of us were in relationships. For a few days, in a hostel with 8 other people in the room, after clear that decision with our partners. I could never imagine going on a 3 week cruise with one of them and sharing a bedroom when they have a partner that is uncomfortable with it. That's just asking for trouble in their relationship and why the hell would I want my friend to have relationship trouble? \n\nCalling in the middle of the night when she's going through a crisis and he's with you, that's fine imo if its an occasional thing. But I get the impression that it's not an occasional thing. And when she knows you are having relationship issues BECAUSE OF HER, that's just downright disrespectful from both of them. But make no mistake, she isn't the problem here, your boyfriend is. The correct response to your partner being uncomfortable with something 99% of people would be uncomfortable with it 'no stress babe, I'll tell her I can't make it.' \n\nHe's not being fair to you. This isn't about trust, it's about respect. Because it's not a matter of you being worried about what else he'll do with her, it's a matter of the lines he is already crossing.", "This woman has other intentions with your boyfriend, and seems unhinged in all honesty.

Thats insane.", "He's gaslighting you. \n\nThis isn't appropriate behaviour between male and female *friends* who have significant others - even if there's an underlying commonality (depression).\n\nGoing on a 3 week cruise together when you haven't as much as met her? Err...\n\nThe first person she should have called in the event of any mental health emergency is her *boyfriend* - regardless of where he was and what he was doing. Calling *your* boyfriend while you're on vacation and have already expressed issues involving her is not okay. Spending 2 hours consoling her whilst on holiday with you is also not okay. Is he her therapist or her boyfriend? Right now, he could be either...but what he's not is *your* boyfriend.\n\nYou're not going crazy, you're not a bad person...you're having a normal reaction to a questionable situation.

If she calls and he's busy, he will not answer.  He keeps phone calls within15mins.  \n\nYour boyfriend is essentially creating another life with her away from you.  You are not crazy.  He knows no sane person would accept the crumbs he and his bbf leaves behind.  He needs to set better boundaries that you are comfortable with or he can start dating his bbf for real with labels.", "NTA. A three week trip seems a bit extreme already.

The issue here is he dismisses it, and do not want to set boundaries with her. That's his problem, not your behavior imo.

(But instead he's putting reverse uno card \"he doesn't like who you are now ?\" pure manipulation / wouldn't buy it.  \nThe only thing you can do, is to set your own limits on what you can endure and what you can't tolerate. And stick to it.", "NTA.  Your bf and his friend are not respecting your boundaries and that's only going to spiral worse and worse.  The whole cruise thing is just odd as hell.  I have friends that are women,  some very close,  but if one was to invite me on a cruise I'd be weirded out, since I'm married.", "Info - are either of them in therapy? \n\nIt sounds to me that especially on her side, your boyfriend is her emotional support animal which is not fair to him, or you. Calling a friend constantly because you're at a risk of self harm is exactly the situation that you need to seek professional help, and this is your responsibility. You cannot make it another person's burden to ensure your safety at all times.", "She\u2019s suicidal in the middle of the night?

No man will schedule a vacation with his girl best friend and leave his girlfriend at home much less for three weeks, on a cruise, where you have to stay on the boat or go on excusions together.

Feelings of concern are always valid.  \n It's clear that you and your bf share a strong bond. Your willingness to trust him despite initial discomfort regarding his close friendship with the other girl is incredible. It's understandable that the incidents caused some concern. I think that expressing your feelings about the cruise and call is incredible. You've been open about your discomfort, and that's an essential step.   \nHowever, it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and a genuine desire to understand each other's perspectives. This person may be in danger of hurting themselves. Although it is an inconvenient time and place, if the person is genuinely at risk of hurting themselves, they have to call someone.

Just consider that if her safety really is at risk, it's OK for her to call, even if you two are on vacation together and it's late at night. \n\nBut it also is reasonable to be suspicious of her, the idea of them taking a 3 week cruise together seems like a lot, and your boyfriend seems more concerned with convincing you it's OK than listening to you and acting considerate of your feelings. \n\nThis woman seems to be taking precedence over you in your boyfriend's life, and that is not OK! It's good that he wants to be there for her, but he's doing so at your expense.", "NTA.  Your bf is the real AH here.  His friend is not so much the problem as he is because he is enabling her dependence on him.\n\nHe called her back for 2 hours after a 1 am text from her while he was on vacation with you.

He probably sees himself as the good guy and is oblivious to why you are upset.\n\nAdd to this, you have never met her after he has been friends with her for 3 years and yet he is going on vacation with her for 3 weeks this spring.

They have a bond that you don't understand because you don't go through what he does and it's very reasonable to be jealous but with your attitude you will end up pushing your partner away. Stop being so disrespectful and insensitive, you should be glad your partner has someone to talk to about these things. Have you ever tried to approach this side of him?

He has been friends with his female best friend for about 3 years. They both have a similar background in terms of trauma, depression etc, and have both been struggling a lot this past year. They\u2019ve formed a bond over it throughout their friendship and this year specifically they have been each other\u2019s go-to call when they are feeling unsafe to be alone. I have always felt a little bit jealous that he has another female person in his life who he is so deeply connected with, since that is something we have never connected over, but I never acted on those jealous feelings because I know there is nothing wrong with having a close female friend. She also has a boyfriend who she lives with of about 2 years. \n\nIn September, this friend asked my boyfriend to go on a 3 week cruise across Europe with her in May 2024, and initially I was very uncomfortable with it but he convinced me I need to trust him (which I do) and that there should be no issue with him going. So they booked it, and now I am starting to feel really uncomfortable about it again, which we have been fighting about for the past week or so. His friend is aware of this and he told me she offered to talk to me to make me feel more comfortable with it, which did not help. I should note I have never met her.\n\nRight now my boyfriend and I are on vacation together, which she knows. Tonight at about 1am she texted my boyfriend to ask if they could call because she is going through some stuff right now. He left our bedroom and they talked for 2 hours. \n\nI told my boyfriend this really bothered me because she is aware that we are having issues regarding her right now, and she knows we are on vacation. I said she should have called her boyfriend instead, and it bothers me that she would rather call my boyfriend instead of her own. \n\nMy boyfriend says that she didn\u2019t want to bother her boyfriend because he was at a sleepover with friends, which is a rare thing for him to do. He says that he is honoured that she feels comfortable calling him and she had no other choice but to call him, otherwise she may have harmed herself. He says that in friendships this is what you do, and he would never not want her to call him when she is in a situation like that. I told him that she had other people she could have called and in our current circumstances it seems like a strange thing to do. He says he doesn\u2019t like who I am right now because he thought I would be more caring about her circumstances. \n\nAITA for being uncomfortable with this friendship?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA - I have the ick after reading this.

An opposite seggs bff is always a huge red flag.

For what purpose should they be alone together on a cruise designed for couples? \nFive years with him and you\u2019ve not met her? Talk about a parade of red flags!\nThis is trust breaking not trust building. \nYou may as well pack it up now. This is more than crossing a boundary, this is blatant disrespect. \nIf you were a guy I\u2019d tell you to man up and quit being a doormat.

Then talks for 2 hours. if it was only the latter, then yk, maybe she did have an episode. but going on a cruise, A CRUISE, with him when you're clearly uncomfortable is insane. also very very weird that you've never met her even after 5 years. that's a red flag already.", "The a sprinkle of red flags here. The most notable thing that he said was that if he didn't take the call, she would have harmed herself.  The fact that he felt honored to have gotten the call is also very bad.

If he insists on having her in his life,  then it might be time to cut him out too.", "Anyone else get the feeling those two will start dating each other the moment they're both single?

Do yourself a favour and end it. This isn't going to work out.", "NTA  It would definitely be helpful if OP's bf set boundaries with his friend.  She has other options to care during crisis, and resistant though she may be, she needs to explore those.", "NTA\n\nOP I also have a panic buddy. We've been friends since high school. Even then I dont call him at 2 am because 1) people need sleep 2) it's on ME to get through therapy and panic less, with useful tools 3) He's married with a kid. 4) we can chat during daylight hours 5) I turn to my SO first, and then my panic buddy only if it's a topic my SO isn't equipped to handle.", "YTA. \n\nYou're insecure and making that other people's problem.

That being said, you really should look into why your bf had to find another best friend while you have been by his side for 5 years. There are so many red flags in this relationship with this girl that trust should be an issue. Why does she want your bf to go on a cruise with her? Why doesn't her boyfriend go on this cruise? If you think that your 21 yr. old bf isn't going to cheat on you with this girl, you're not thinking straight. He's choosing her over you and your relationship on a regular basis and you're letting it happen. He now says that he doesn't like the person you are right now. This is him using your personal feelings against you. Caring for someone else's circumstances and being manipulated by them are two different things. Find yourself a male best friend, go on a 3-week cruise with that male and see how your bf handles that. Something is definitely not right with this situation.", "Your boyfriend going on a 3 week long trip without you, with a woman you've never met, where they'll be stuck on a cruise ship together..... yeah.

He might be calling you the roommate with benefits or the local gf until they can be together again.\n\nAlso, you started dating when you were 16 if the math is right. Who you were at 16 is very different than who you are at 21. Maybe it's time to let him go and find someone who values you more than their \"she just my best friend\".", "So you've known her boyfriend a while, this will probably get a lot of down votes but be petty!! Become his best friend and see how they feel", ">never expressed an interest in having us meet\n\nGirl....", ">They met working at a restaurant together, worked together for about a year. Now live in different cities but see each other about once every couple months. I\u2019m pretty introverted so wasn\u2019t too fussed with meeting her at the beginning and then we just never ended up crossing paths. He\u2019s never expressed an interest in having us meet. I have met her boyfriend though since we knew each other in high school.\n\nop said, they didnt met because op didnt want to, probably never asked and complains taht he doesn't express interest in their SO meeting his bf because OP doesnt like her.\n\nIf my bf ever wants me to ditch my bff or not lend them my ear in their time of need, he wont be my bf much longer. people see red flags everywhere these days becase they are red flags themselves.\n\n\"They don't call and talk for 2 hours at night while their best friend is on vacation with their partner\"  - they do. You never know what's going onm with someone. you can have your bff and SO in the same person sure. but if you lose one you lose them both.", "Oh hell yes!! Good call.", "No, OP should not use someone like that. She *should* use her time to find a new place so she can pack up all of her things and move while her shitty boyfriend is cruising with his annoying bestie though.", "You're really just editing and responding to half sentences that you're cutting to suit you.\n\nI _agreed_ that she was shy but I said the fact that he was not interested in making them meet is a red flag. Your partner and your best friend are some of the most important people in your lives. They've been best friends for 3 whole years and he's never wanted his gf to meet her? Red flag.\n\nThe vacation bit again you cut off the rest of my point. She had a boyfriend to call. The only reason she gave for not calling him was that he was with his friends. In that case why is OP's bf being with OP on vacation not an equal deterrent? ESPECIALLY when she knows they're having relationship issues BECAUSE of her? With all that context, a genuine caring respectful best friend would have either called her own bf, called the best friend but not spoken for 2 hours, or called the best friend _in the morning_.", "I can't answer the whys because OP dont say what they talked about. Why didn't she call her bf? Maybe because she feels more confortable talking about certain things with her friend than with er bf, just like OP's bf is more confortable talking to his freind than to OP.  \n\n\nAgain with them meeting, op has certainly made it clear she doesnt like the friend, why would he insist? My bf also hates my bff and i dont force them together, unless is something i host at home and my bff visits on purpouse.   \n\n\nShe asked him first if she could call him, he said yes, also they were in bed, so im guessing he didn't reach for the phone during sexy time, so i guess they were going to sleep?  \n\n\nIm sticking with my NAH, say all you want about red flags, cheating and disrespect, OP is entitled to being jealous, yes, BFF is entitled to look for her friends support instead of her own bf, her bf is entitled to be out with friends and be away and OP's bf is entitled to talk to his friend if the only thing he was doing was going to sleep.", ">Why didn't she call her bf? Maybe because she feels more confortable talking about certain things with her friend than with er bf, just like OP's bf is more confortable talking to his freind than to OP.\n\nUm you made that up. She herself said she didn't call her bf simply because he was at guys night.\n\nThe rest of your comment is more speculation and misinterpretation. I never said cheating. You're not commenting in good faith so I'm gonna say bye now. \ud83d\udc4b"]}
