I'm exhausted and have had a bad week. That said, I would like to know if I'm being a jerk in this situation.\n\nI'm staying with a peer this summer until mid-August. His parents own the house and I send them rent each month. Occasionally his girlfriend will stay the night. He works night shifts so sometimes she's just here hanging out in his room. This is all well and good except she is so painfully loud. This has been going on for three weekends straight with a couple of weeknights sporadically.\n\nLast weekend was the second weekend in a row. On Friday, after being woken up multiple times by her talking, laughing, dropping stuff, singing, etc. between 10 PM and 2 AM, I went downstairs and knocked on the door. She didn't open the door but asked what I wanted. I told her she was waking me up and asked if she could quiet down which she did for the remainder of that night.\n\nSaturday, same thing. I knocked on the door, but this time she answered it and said she was sorry, but that she has ADHD and stops masking at night to let out her pent up energy/impulsivity. I don't know how any of that works so I didn't argue. Sunday night, same thing. This time when I knocked on the door she flipped out and said she was getting uncomfortable with, as she put it, \"another guy trying to come into the room when Andrew \\[housemate\\] isn't home\" and said she's establishing a \"boundary\" that I can't knock on the door when Andrew's not home.\n\nLast night she was doing it again so I went and knocked on the door. Since then she and Andrew have been saying I'm an AH for violating her boundaries and making her feel unsafe. I told them *I* feel unsafe because I can't sleep. I have to get up at 3 AM for work and some mornings feel like I'm driving impaired, I'm having headaches most days and don't feel mentally well except for during the workweek when she's not staying over. \n\nAITA for knocking on the door after being asked not to?

If they're being disruptive and trampling your boundaries with regard to quiet, they can't expect you to not \"violate her boundaries\", lol. Is there anyone else you can complain to?", "NTA, you should \u2018set a boundary\u2019 that she can\u2019t be there unless her boyfriend\u2019s there. It\u2019s honestly kind of creepy, and she\u2019d surely complain if there was a random man in her home she didn\u2019t know.", "NTA \n\nI hate the way people weaponize therapy speak to twist the narrative so they can play victim. A boundary is not saying that you should actually be able to do whatever you want whenever you want and never be held accountable for the impact of your actions. A boundary like that isn\u2019t a valid boundary. \n\nYou live there. You need to be able to sleep. She doesn\u2019t live there, and her boyfriend isn\u2019t home, so she can go where she actually does live to let her late night impulsivity out or she can stay and be considerate. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s worth considering what you know about the family dynamic. You don\u2019t want to risk him telling his parents a twisted narrative and convincing them that you\u2019re a creep that needs to be removed from the house.", "NTA, since you're paying rent, maybe talk to his parents (the owner of the house) about it? As it's affecting your sleep quality, and that's well, not great.", "NTA.  The girl is a bit nuts if she thinks you knocking on the door to ask her to be quiet is threatening in any manner.  And what is up with Andrew?   Taking her side just so he can get some action later?   I don't get it.", "Yeah\u2026. This is not how \u2018boundaries\u2019 work. I\u2019m sick of people weaponising pseudo-therapy speak to manipulate people. She\u2019s not setting a boundary, she\u2019s being a huge asshole.

Your action was a desperate move to get him to intervene as his GF isn't a paying tenant and you didn't know what else to do.\n\nIf it doesn't work out, move out.\n\nNta", "NTA. \n\nIf she wants to \"stop masking\" at night, she can go to her own house and do that. I have ADHD and on occasion when I've had roommates I have once or twice *forgotten* or not realized that it was later than I thought, and accidentally making more noise than was appropriate for the hour, for which I *apologized* and then tried to be more mindful of the time. It's not \"masking\" to not make a ton of noise late at night, that's called \"living around other people.\" I had a roommate who also has ADHD and we were both respectful of each other's sleep needs in an apartment where noise carried a *lot*. \n\nIf she's uncomfortable with you knocking on the door to ask her to be quiet so you can sleep at night *in your apartment that you pay rent for*, she can go home or provide another method of contact.", "NTA. She sounds like shes making shameful excuses and using the wrong language to make you the bad guy for calling her out on her unacceptable behavior.\n\nYou live there. She doesn't. She needs to respect YOUR boundaries. And that means to let you sleep without disturbing you.\n\nSaying she doesn't feel safe just because you knocked on her door in a home you live in??? \nThat is ridiculous. She sounds like a real peace of work.\n\nHopefully she will either learn to respect you, or stop staying there.\n\nSorry you have to put up with this.\nI hope it gets better for you.", "NTA, you are paying rent and should probably complain to your landlords about it.", "NTA - she should respect quiet hours which 2am falls under. If she feels unsafe, then she can just not stay there unless BF is there.", "Yeah pretty sure every tenant has the basic right to the quiet enjoyment of their leased premises, which definitely includes not being woken up by unreasonable noises past certain times at night. NTA. Lots of people with ADHD aren't inconsiderate assholes.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t pay rent; I don\u2019t think she should have any say in things. You pay to live there, and you have a right to expect quiet during quiet hours, and have priority over how things go in the house over her.\n\nHave you tried talking to your mate about it? If he\u2019s reasonable, I\u2019d hope he could see your perspective, but I could see it potentially turning out with him resenting you too. \n\nGiven the situation; I think you have 2 non-confrontational options:\n\n1. Get a white noise machine in your room; there are a few cheaper options that do a decent job blocking out noise from other rooms.\n\n2. Maybe try putting in earplugs when you go to bed.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a difficult situation for you, and I\u2019d hope you\u2019re able to resolve it amicably. But you\u2019re NTA for expecting quiet when you\u2019re trying to sleep.", "NTA.   \n\n\nThe guest is a guest, doesn't pay rent and she is being disruptive in a house that aint even hers. You should try to talk to your friend and the home owners about the situation so it doesn't escalate to the point that your friend's GF tries to get you kicked out.", "NTA. you're paying the rent, it's not his house alone. \nYou also deserve to Have your space and sleep. Ask her not to cross the boundaries- disturbing you in sleep. \nI'm this petty as I would scream when she is sleeping to let her know how annoying it is.", "NTA here's a thought - if you're making her uncomfortable when she's in your house then she should leave your house because it is not he'd house! WTF is wrong with people??", "NTA. She apparently has her own place, and is doing this when Andrew is not there...WHY? Go home and cause problems there. Does she act like this when Andrew is home? I doubt it. She probably can't get away with it at her place because her own roommates or family won't put up with it or her neighbors have complained.\n\nI get wanting to unmask but not at the expense of other people. Boundaries go both ways.", "NTA. If they don't make noise you don't knock on their door.\n\nEdit: in the knowledge that you only have 4 weeks left, finding a long-term solution is futile. Do your best to come up with something they'll agree to in the short term.", "NTA. However, OP, you need to find another living arrangement and leave as soon as possible. Your housemate is not respectful of your sleeping times. If you're supposed to be waking up at 3am for work, your sleeping habits will be continuously be affected. Please, do not go out on the road when you've not slept properly or feel mentally unwell, as you can easily get into an accident.", "F her. She has a LOT of nerve making demands and continually is loud and disruptive.\n\nThis is what I would say.....\"I know you prefer me not to knock on your door, but I also prefer to get up for work after I have slept, not get woken up 5 times a night. Look outside, look at your phone.... set an alarm...do whatever it takes to remind you of the time and keep it down.\n\nAs a GUEST and not a paying tenant you don't have the rights you feel entitled to.  \n The next knock will be from police arresting you for trespassing and disturbing the peace. I'd like to hear her tell this shit to a cop. Stay firm with people like that. Or she'll think she can walk all over you.", "YTA. Maybe discuss things when you're peer is there too and try to figure out a solution. If she says she feels unsafe, respect that. It may not make sense to you but there's plenty of reasons why that could be. Point to note tho- She's not setting a boundary, because that's not what a boundary is. Her boundaries can't control your/other people's behaviour, only her reaction to them.\n\nEx- She doesn't like your knocking. Her boundary would be - anytime you knock she ignores you and wears noise cancelling headphones etc. \n\nMaybe it's time to start looking for new accommodation if it doesn't work out tbh. All the best op.", "I mean, NTA, but you're also trying to solve a problem using a tactic that only worked once. Time to let go of that tactic. \n\nYou need to start by talking to either Andrew alone or both of them. Be reasonable and open to compromise. Recognise that what you're asking for is also hard \u2013 after working all week, I wouldn't want to stop making noise at 10pm on Friday and Saturday night. \n\n\"I don't want anyone to feel unsafe \u2013 that's not my intention here. But we need to find a way to coexist that keeps everyone happy. I know I have a difficult work schedule for you guys, and you have a difficult play schedule for me. Any ideas?\"\n\nThere are ideas. There are headphones and ear plugs. There are ways to talk and laugh in your room without banging. Just try and work it out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I only have about 4 weeks left until I move out so if I have to I'll just deal and try to think of another way to go about it.", "This is what I planned to say. Precisely this.", "Completely agree! A boundary here would be if she said 'i'm not comfortable with opening the door when Andrew isn't here so if you knock at night I will not be opening the door, instead I will communicate with you through the door or via a messaging app'. \n\nBoundaries are what we set for ourselves, not telling other people what to do! Ugh drives me bananas how often folks get that backwards.", "My point exactly!!!", "It will eventually. In 4 weeks I'll be back in the dorms which are, surprisingly, much quieter, lol.", "I agree with using technology to try and dampen the noise. OP only has four weeks left, hopefully this will work.

If not, then I suggest being petty as mentioned by a fellow commenter. Be as loud as you can when you get up for work. Also, I suggest you tell them she needs to find a better time and place to \"unmask\". As someone with ADHD, myself, I know when and when not to. Do it at a time where no one's around and/or asleep. She's inconsiderate and I feel like if she can say that to you, then she's fully aware of how it makes you feel. She can't use that as an excuse. She's grown, not a child.", "If you have his parents\u2019 info, you could let them know about the obnoxiously loud girlfriend.  I doubt they\u2019d be happy that he\u2019s letting her make it hard to keep tenants, especially if the plan is to let your room to someone else after you leave.", "Her pulling the ADHD thing is so wrong I have it and I never have used my energy like that to harm others like that. Either drink an energy drink, learn to stim quietly, or get that energy out prior. If anything I\u2019d say something to your landlords on this or your roommate.", "Sorry to ask (I know Google is free) but what even is unmasking?", "Incorrect. I don't think it's a \"big favor\". I think the girlfriend needs to find a way to make sure she's not preventing OP from sleeping. \n\nBut I lived in share houses all through my 20s and into my early 30s (I don't know how old these people are, but I'm guessing in their 20s) and I think it's realistic to expect young people might be noisy. You've got to work with what you've got. \n\nIt's not a crime to make noise in your own home on Friday night. However, you have to allow the people you live with to sleep \u2013 particularly if that person needs to drive safely at 3am.\n\nSomehow they have to find a way to figure the problem out. My point was that the knocking-on-the-door method isn't working. Fighting about who's right isn't going to work. \n\nShare house problems are best resolved when everyone is relaxed and honest and prepared to compromise. You've got to see it as a problem to solve together. \n\nIt's like marriage. It's not you vs me. It's you and me vs the problem.", "That's a fair point. I guess I'm a little hesitant because there's no actual agreement, and they are being very generous. Basically once the semester was over Andrew (not a friend but someone I've met on campus a few times) said his parent's place had an extra room. Since it's close to my work it seemed like a good fit, plus they only ask $200 a month from me which is hard to turn down.", "As an ADHDer I explain it like this: You know how people have thier \"customer service\" voice when they answer the phone at work but that is not how they sound at all when they answer their personal phone after work...that is unmasking. We don't have to be \"on\". \n\nThat being said I am also calling BS on this whole unmasking excuse in this situation as Therapist who specializes in ADHD (with ADHD which is as strange as it sounds). Masking does not work like that. We don't magically become jerks who keep people up at night in flagrant disregard to other people. Especially not consistently for hours. Because usually we are so emotionally burnt out and exhausted from masking all day. \n\nIt does sound like she has been taking therapy lessons on TikTok though and using...someone said weaponizing and I think that is a better fit, specific psychological terms to make you feel like you are in the wrong. Her behavior does not reflect unmasking nor boundaries. However her behavior does reflect her need for power and control.", "Unmasking is when someone with neurodiversity stops pretending to be neurotypical.", "Think about working with customers or something like that all day and then clocking out and getting to drop the smile/happy voice and just breathe and be yourself without constantly checking to make sure you don't have a resting bitch face or when you get home and get to change into relaxing clothes... Unmasking is essentially a bigger form of that.", "Can you wear earphones to block out the noise?", "That is super frickin cheap most everywhere with a school if you're in the usa. I'd sleep with ear plugs and call it the cost of cheap rent.\n\n(Generally she's being an AH and you're not for knocking, but like, I don't think it's reasonable to expect equal consideration when you're renting a place for well under half of market rate. That's like 1/5 the price of the cheapest bedroom you'd be able to rent in my county, but if it's market rate where you are then I do think you & other residents deserve equal consideration.)"]}
