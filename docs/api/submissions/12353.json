It seems that he\u2019s with these girls just to get them pregnant. Does he have a kink as well as custody of every single one of these kids? No way he can afford that.

There is nothing wrong with calling someone out on a behavior  pattern that you feel is harming others.", "NTA. He's just spreading his seed around and running for one.

I feel like your dad has given you ample opportunity to exclude him from your life with his very questionable decision making.", "NTA", "NTA you father seems like he loves to knock up these young ladies and ditch them after wards. Your father is absolutely to old to be doing all that, constantly making babies by different women even going as far as dating people your age most likely kids you go or went to school with. I'm sorry OP but your dad is a little creepy. I'm willing to bet the that was mostly a senior you brother saw in your father's car.", "NTA. I would have cut him off now.", "NTA. No one has the right to tell you where your line in the Sand is. The fact that your 22-year-old brother also did not congratulate his father is a very telling point, because it means that he understands that what his father's doing is wrong as well. Threatening to go no contact with your father if he brings another young woman home and or gets her pregnant is not going to change his behavior because he is a serial impregnator. He gets his jollies on getting women pregnant, but obviously does not want to hang around to raise those children. Your dad actually caused the issue by pushing you for congratulations, when you were just going to completely ignore it and let it be. Your other brothers are 15-year-old teenage boys, they don't know squat, so it doesn't matter if they're angry or not. Kudos on you though for being brave enough to point out his terrible behavior.", "NTA. Your dad sounds like a creep.

My dad left my mom whilst pregnant with my sister for supposed infidelity (my mom denies any affairs, paternity tests all positive). \n\nLess than two years later he married 'Sarah' (F39) who he has my twin brothers (M15,M15) and sister (F12) with, he left her when they whilst they were trying for a fourth just two years after my sisters birth. (I found this out just last year. My mom and her are friends and my half-siblings would regularly come over.) \n\nFor a couple years after that he would regularly bring young women along with him for visitation (at my moms or grandparents house), eventually he would have them wait in his car (I think my mom asked him to). I didn't care much since I was always happy to see him and he usually brought gifts/candy with him. My brother however was always skeptical and when he was a freshman in high school swore he saw a senior from his school in dads car and refused to see him until my dad introduced us to his (now-ex) fianc\u00e9 (then early 30s). They announced a pregnancy not long after but sadly lost the baby a few weeks later, I found out later that he broke up with her only a couple months after the miscarriage. (He initially said it was amicable.) \n\nSince then my dad never introduced us to any other girlfriend of his though I've heard through my half-siblings and family friends that he was still dating 'younger women'. I never brought it up much since I figured they would be in their late 20s/early 30s or something. \n\nThree months ago my dad admitted to all his children in our group chat that he was expecting another child and I later found out that the mother was only 20 and that they were not together anymore. Three weeks ago he posted in the same chat a picture of him holding the baby in a hospital gown. Whilst everyone else (except my older brother) congratulated him I just couldn't. \n\nOn Sunday I saw him for the first time after the announcement at my grandparents place. We talked a little and he asked me why I was acting so 'cold' towards him. I shrugged it off but when he asked why I hadn't congratulated him I lost it: I told him that getting a girl my age who he wasn't even in a relationship with pregnant was not an achievement. \n\nHe made excuses saying she was very mature and wanted to be a young mother anyways and that he wasn't the one to break off the relationship. After we argued back and fourth for a while I ended up telling him that if I ever found out he was dating a women my age again I'd go zero contact with him and stormed off. \n\nWhen I called my grandma that evening to apologize for leaving before lunch she told me that whilst she understood were I was coming from, my grandpa and my half-bothers were furious with me. When I told some friends yesterday they told me they understood my motives but figured I am being a little to harsh on him. So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd advise you to stay away from him and warn others about him", "Uhhhhh....\n\nI'm back and forth on this. Do I think it's odd he's dating people who were children when he was raising his children? Yep.\n\nAre they all adults with the right to make their own choices? Yep.\n\nDo you have the right to refuse contact with people whose behavior makes you uncomfortable? Yep.\n\nDo I think you used the threat of that to try to control another adult's behavior? Yep.\n\nWas that morally wrong? Yep.\n\nIs it an AH move? .... ehhhhh\n\n>or a couple years after that he would regularly bring young women along with him for visitation\n\nI think this is coming from an unresolved trauma point, and therefore you weren't doing it to cause harm, but to protect yourself. Which pulls it out of AH territory.\n\nI do think you're being harsh on him, but that doesn't mean it's unjustified. \n\nGrandpa and half-brothers are kinda AHs because it's your relationship with him, not theirs... if they are trying to force a change. And not AHs for just *feeling* angry.\n\nI *would* say your father wasn't an AH (and vote no AHs here) solely for dating someone with a huge age gap, because even though it's *usually* a flag, people *can* fall in love, but...\n\nIt seems like he's doing this serially... which indicates he's probably (~~icky~~) kind of an AH... so...\n\nI guess NTA", "It\u2019s okay to tell your dad that dating little girls (compared to him) is NC worthy.

Sorry about that.", "NTA I am married to an older man. He did NOT want to date me because he thought I was too young. I was a few weeks from 28 when we did go out for the first time. He was 52, almost 53. Our relationship is consentual and I was an adult, not just coming out of my teens. He also has no history of dating women way younger. Before me was a woman I think a few years older. Before that also a woman ten years older. Anyway, no targeting of young women or pattern of behavior. We do have two children (and no more cuz he just got the snip) Definitely a bit of a do-over family. But he did not just knock me up and leave. He does have a son 5 years younger than me. It is a bit weird. But he in no way views me as the same age as his child if that makes sense. And my age was a deterrent, not an attraction. So anyway, I feel like a good person to weigh in on this being with someone so much my senior. Your dad is creepy af. What he is doing is NOT normal, especially since he seems to have a fetish of making all these children and dating teens and those fresh out of their teens. I really hope this girl consented to getting pregnant because it was obviously 100 percent deliberate on his part and I could see him poking holes in condoms or \"forgetting\" to put them on, yikes.", "Softest of YTA. Honestly I think it\u2019s icky and gross he\u2019s dating girls that much younger but he\u2019s a grown ass adult dating consenting adults, who you\u2019re threatening and giving ultimatums to. It\u2019s his choice who he dates and it\u2019s your choice if you\u2019re in his life or not.
