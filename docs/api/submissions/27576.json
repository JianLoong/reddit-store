She clearly named them that for attention at this point if she's upset you didn't gush over them and make a big deal, and didn't get the reaction she wanted.

Everyone told them it was a bad idea as the kid would be bullied all the time.\n\nTheir compromise was to use their preferred name as a middle name and they chose something more mainstream for a first name.
