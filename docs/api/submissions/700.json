Go buy her a new heater.  And, you best hope she doesn't file a complaint with HR for your poor decision.  When you give her the new one.  Say, sorry.

And ZERO remorse foe Debbie.\n\nPeople in an office that are cold can PUT ON more layers.  Socks, wool pants, a wool poncho draped over her legs.\n\nPeople that are hot in the office can't strip down to a bikini for comfort.  Debbie offered no compromise and zero sympathy for you.\n\nAlso.... this is \"AITA\" not \"is this legal?\".  It certainly wasn't legal for you to have broken the heater but it doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA. When someone\u2019s cubicle space crap invades your cubicle space, it\u2019s a problem.

You destroyed the heating coil of an old appliance then left it for your coworker to figure out? With no care that it could have hurt her when she tried to use it? Yeah, you are the asshole and your wife is right, you do owe her a replacement.
