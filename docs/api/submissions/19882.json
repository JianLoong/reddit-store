So Cassey, an adult with 4 kids, is all butthurt about something that had nothing to do with her and because she isn't treated as the main character that she thinks she deserves to be AND threw a giant tantrum ruining everyone's evening?

That's it? \n\nNTA- Cassey is being ridiculous.", "NTA\nI'm guessing SIL with 4 kids has enjoyed her role as 'mother of grandchildren'. 4 new babies will take the spotlight of her and her children.", "NTA she's rediculous, also your mum's an AH for the way she acted. You have nothing to apologise for, sounds like Cassey was jealous she wasn't getting any attention her and your brother are also major AH who should apologies for ruining your SIL announcement", "NTA-Cassey is so vain she thinks everything is about her.", "Have you ever congratulated Cassey on her pregnancies ? \n\nWhat are you leaving out of the story here ?", "YTA for making that impossible to read.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
