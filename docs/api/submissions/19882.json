Everyone else should have done the same.", "It's a twin thing.\n\nNot only are you two expecting your first children, it turns out that both of you are expecting twins (more common in older mothers).This will be a big event in your family and unless Cassey gets pregnant with twins, your children will be the ones talked about. She's a bit jealous.", "NTA. Cassey sounds absolutely ridiculous and is the AH for sure. You and Elena are expecting, Cassey is not so why should you need to congratulate her or include her in the conversation? She already has 4 kids so was she just expecting to be congratulated for the kids she already has? Your mom is also the AH for claiming you ruined dinner when you did nothing wrong. Cassey is just a drama Queen who is mad that all the attention won\u2019t be on her and her kids because 4 new grandkids will be coming all at once (or at least fairly close together)", "She's jealous that you're both having twins close to together. That your children yourself & your sister will become closer because of this. NTA", "She's no longer the only one who could produce grandchildren.  Then you both performed some sort of magic that allowed you both to be pregnant with twins. Not only is the attention going to be off Cassie, if will also be off her kids. She's already anticipating how her kids will get \"less\" on Christmas because everything will be about the babies. I'd bet on it. \n\nYou did nothing wrong here. It was just an awesome twist of fate that it happened. Congratulations all around! NTA"]}
