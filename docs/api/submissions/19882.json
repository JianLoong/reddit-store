You and Elena are expecting, Cassey is not so why should you need to congratulate her or include her in the conversation? She already has 4 kids so was she just expecting to be congratulated for the kids she already has? Your mom is also the AH for claiming you ruined dinner when you did nothing wrong.

Did she have 4 singleton births, each a quest to have twins??? Did she lose twins??? IDK. Super weird, but whatever the reason, it's not your fault and you did nothing wrong. They need to use their words and be mature if there is something there.\n\nAs an aside, do not say 'sorry' as a knee-jerk reaction. I received this advice too late in life. They need to state what the perceived offense is, why it offended them, give you grace to say whether you meant it that way or if you even knew it would cause offense, and then you can sincerely apologize if you did wrong or tell them you will keep that in mind going forward since you didn't know before. Unfortunately, giving people a sorry or an apology is the decent thing but oftentimes, people aren't mature and they see it as a concession of fault and that they were right.", "NTA is it possible though that she's had a miscarriage or something that's making this a sensitive subject? If that was the case, your SIL should have known and changed the subject.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong here.", "NTA, you did not ruin the dinner, Cassie did because she felt slighted.

Asking genuinely.", "Nope, i didn't say something like that. I just told elena that this is exciting and looking forward for the gender reveals.", "Well, then, congratulations to you too for having 4 kids! I really should congratulate you more often for that.", "I guess? I mean Cassey would be right to feel left out at that point because this is something she could never bond with them over. It would be a a little bit of an AH move to say this right in front of Cassey. \n\nThink of it like you meet up with 2 friends, one friend you went to school with and another which you and your school friend just happened to meet and click well with. It would be a dick move to start talking with your school friend about your memories in school because the other friend can't join in or relate. They'd be left out and feel bad for it. Objectively you'd be right that you're school friends and the memories you share will exist. But it doesn't make it any less rude to discuss it right in front of the other friend and leave them out of the conversation.\n\nCassey can participate in conversations about motherhood and pregnancy like you and your 2 friends can discuss things you were all there for. But if OP and Elena start discussing twin stuff specifically then Cassey gets left out just like the new friend gets left out when you talk about school memories", "If that's true then NTA. I'm just baffled by what happened", "She knows sil number 2 feel put aside and unloved. She \"forgot\" to tell us until the end. The drama started well before what OP told us.\nThis post is not honest", "While I don't particularly disagree with your point, I do believe that people bond differently with every other person. \n\n2 people who have a certain type of bonding don't necessarily have to share a similar one with a 3rd person. \n\nWould Casey feel left out if OP had said it that way, sure. But making them apologise for not including her in something she couldn't be in would also be a little AH-ly.\n\nAlso this is just me being nitpicky but we don't know if any of Casey's 4 children are twins (Most probably not since OP would have mentioned it).", "I think it's fair to expect an apology for being left out like that. Using my example earlier, if someone told me I was leaving out my newer friend by discussing school memories, I'd definitely ask and apologise if they did feel left out. \n\nIdk I've been in a similar situation where I've been left out and just had to awkwardly stand there. I wouldn't kick up a storm or anything but I'd definitely feel left out. Cassey actually left without saying a word. It was the brother and mother that told them to apologise. It was only after they approached her that she told them to fuck off", "Hello everyone, i have read all of your opinions and comments.\n1. , english is not my first language and not my second language either, if there's any error, please forgive me.
