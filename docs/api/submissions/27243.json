Bleeding all over someone\u2019s bad and sheets is unsanitary. Not in a \u201cperiods are gross\u201d way. In a \u201cbiological materials decomposing in the thing you sleep on\u201d way. Would it be ok for you to vomit all over her stuff because you\u2019re a free-puker?", "NTA she's being gross.", "NTA.  No, no, no, this is NOT cool of her.  I\u2019m a woman and a feminist.  The occasional leak happens to everyone at some point, especially heavy bleeders, so you\u2019d be TA if you were making a fuss about that, but yiu aren\u2019t.  Expecting to free-bleed on anything the person with the period doesn\u2019t own is ridiculous (and especially when we\u2019re talking about something that isn\u2019t easy to clean, gross).  Expecting her to manage her period so she\u2019s not damaging your possessions is reasonable.  \n\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to preface this by saying that you are NOT required to go this route to be a decent person/ not TA.  This is if you want to try to meet both your wants/needs in a way that doesn\u2019t leave you dealing with blood seeping into your mattress.  It would be generous beyond what is required.\n\nI know some folks with vaginas need to sleep nude to avoid yeast infections, so if that\u2019s her reasoning, you still have some options that could potentially work for both of you.  If she feels the need to free-bleed, you would be totally reasonable to insist on a waterproof mattress protector and her dealing with the laundry (and if needed, replacing anything that gets stained).  It would also be fair to insist the she needs to buy some period sheets so your sheets aren\u2019t going through the extra wear of daily washes during her period.  Extra bedding (blankets, comforter, whatever) might also be needed to avoid damaging things, or at least limit the damage to a single set.  For frequently washed blankets, if you don\u2019t need a lot of warmth, I definitely recommend woven cotton blankets.  They get softer when washed and don\u2019t get damaged by going through the dryer, so they can be washed and ready for the next night.  That\u2019s a compromise where she can be naked if that\u2019s what she needs without destroying your stuff.\n\nAs far as the mattress protector, we use Biloban brand mattress protectors for my incontinent elderly dog\u2019s beds, and our experience with them has been good, though we\u2019ve had them for less than 6 months, so I can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll last forever.  They\u2019re quiet and soft, so they don\u2019t crinkle-crackle or feel plasticky on the bed.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m saying this as a woman in my 30s. \n\nYou can do what you want with your own stuff. But you don\u2019t deliberately mess with someone else\u2019s possessions  Be they family, friends or partner. It\u2019s a sign of disrespect. I\u2019d have kicked her off the bed and out the door. \n\nTo the girlfriend: be better.", "She needed to stomp off to her own bed, where she can do as she pleases. NTA.", "NTA, she can't just do as she pleases just because she's menstruating and wants to free bleed. If she really wanted to she should do it in a way where you're both comfortable with it - like putting down absorbents or towels or whatever.\n\nOr like you have - put down some sheet protector", "Ugh. I do not understand free bleeding, whatever that is. I hate my periods but I find free bleeding more gross than my periods.\n\n\nNTA, your stuff is not a communal blood letting place.", "Well since she's reading this: lady, you're gross.

That\u2019s gross and it\u2019s going to ruin the mattress.", "Leave it for her to clean up! How can she do it and not see anything wrong with it?", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a disgusting pig. As a general life rule, you try and avoid bleeding on other people's things, and if you do, you replace it or clean it yourself! God I hope this is a bad joke.\n\nTell your girlfriend her 'yeah.. but.. what abouts..' are completely irrelevant and the general consensus from anybody with a fucking brain or modicum of respect for another human being agrees she is disgusting.", "I would be kicking her to the curb for this.\n\nLiterally.\n\nNTA OP.\n\nBut your girlfriend is an inconsiderate, selfish, unhygienic asshole that should go and bleed all over her own stuff, and leave yours the hell alone.", "PS made a mistake of showing her that I posted this. She insists that I mention that my mattress is not destroyed. I had a mattress protector on the bed, so that is what really is getting ruined. However, I was the one who put the mattress protector on. I guess I was smart, considering what happened. The spare bed I don\u2019t believe has a mattress protector. \n\nEdit: This might be TMI but the reason I have the mattress protector is because I have a tendency to make women \u201csquirt\u201d. \n\nEdit: I replenish them frequently, if there is a problem. \n\nShe also attacks my mentioning of the dishes, even though it\u2019s not something she can contend with. \n\nJust for further clarification / fairness even though I feel it\u2019s immaterial.", "\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e Go to a medical supply store and buy one of those cloth pads they put under people in the hospital who are incontinent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
