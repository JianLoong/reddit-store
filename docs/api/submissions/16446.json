Feeling perplexed that he just walked off with no real explanation of what he was ordering. 15 mins later a heap of food arrives. Now we had no idea about what kind of food nor did he ask but he has done this before and last time it happened he just kind of took control of the food without asking. I wasn't really into the food and am the kind of diner who likes to look at the menu and discuss with my wife and dinner partners what our choices are,   these decisions are often taste based and sometimes financial. \nAnyway back to dinner- besides feeling brushed off with him walking off midway through a story I was telling and  i feeling quite annoyed as I feel like he had taken liberties and didn't take into consideration what others wanted. Not even a question of whether we we ready. Now I'm happy to be treated out as someone's guests but it just feels odd to not be asked and have someone control a table like that.\nI did say to him that I felt put out because ordering is a collective effort but he hasn't contacted me since.\nAITA here?\nKeen to hear your input .\n\nEdit: the 16 year old boy didn't order, that's my shit grammar.  My male friend ordered. \nThanks for the feedback I felt like I may be overacting but now feel a bit better hearing what you guys think\n\nEdit 2 :OK more context.  menus were out but people weren't even looking at them. We were sitting on 2 couches. \nWe weren't discussing food we were having pre dinner drinks and myself and male friend  were talking. I was telling a story but were were there in discussion for about 10 mins drink in hand. No mention of food.\nHe literally stood up before the punch line and said I'm getting some food. \nMeanwhile I'm left sitting, the others are drinking - I even asked my wife what she wanted to eat n she said I'm not ready to order.\nA while later my friend comes back and he said I bought some tacos. \nSo I think fuck and said you could have waited he just shruggs it off so I go speak to my wife and we organise some choices for us 2.\nI go to the counter and come back- there's tacos on the table and people are sharing and my mate is giving out the food ..at that point I realised there was a bit of unintentional fuckery which pissed me off  ...\nWhy?\nI like to discuss our choices, tastes etc etc at no point did he say he was going to host us or pay for the lot.\nThis brings a few things up primarily I don't like to treated unless I understand I am. I come from a poor ass back ground and worked fucking hard to get where we are.\nI also felt power play on his behalf as I study human behavior and wasn't born in the last shower. \nI'm all about consent and open discussion.. \nHope this helped fill in the gaps", "created_utc": 1683290881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138kokm/aita_for_opposing_my_friends_dinner_order/", "score": 1044, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think your friend is probably not worth bothering with honestly. Seems self obsessed.", "Info: How long after sitting down at the restaurant did he get up to order?\n\nHis behavior was definitely rude, but I\u2019m wondering if you were so into your conversation you might\u2019ve also been making the table wait longer to order food which is also quite rude.", "How long had the convo been going on? Did it appear he tried to find a break in the convo to ask about food? You said you like to take a while to order. Maybe he was tired of waiting for you to finish your story, read the menu, and confer with your wife. Is he (who ordered the food), the 16 year old son or the husband of the couple? Why, after waiting 5 or 10 minutes did you not get suspicious and go check with the person who left instead of just continue talking? \n\nI just wonder if you weren\u2019t being one of those people who talks and talks and talks without recognizing social cues.

Who does that?", "NTA\n\nThis is the weirdest story I've heard all week.", "This is odd but I\u2019m getting the sense that he hosted and paid for everything?  With this long of a history, I\u2019m thinking there is a reason he acts this way.  Maybe he wanted a particular vibe for the meal he was throwing for people, maybe he didn\u2019t want to wait for what he expected to be a long process for you to finish your talking, peruse the menu, debate and negotiate choices etc.  Maybe he feels like his generosity in paying gets taken advantage of people guests ordering the most expensive thing every time when he\u2019s paying\u2026 who knows.  Maybe it was a family style meal like buca de peppos and he wanted to get it started and get people home for commitments you didn\u2019t know about and he knows your stories and process are long winded and he thought letting you go on while he took care of business was the least obtrusive\u2026 \n\nI do think your comment about wanting to choose what he buys you was a little offputting, I can see myself thinking someone I hosted for a meal was rude if they ate, didn\u2019t pay and then bitched.  \n\nI feel like there is more here because of the length of the relationship.  The solution is to pay for yourself going forward", "NTA\n\nYou should order your own food. It is beyond controlling to order food for the whole table.", "NTA: Just because he is paying for the food doesn\u2019t mean he gets to control what you eat.. it seems like that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s paying for it honestly.

Was this a sit-down or order-at-the-counter restaurant.\n\nBecause I can easily see this being a scenario where you were droning on for an extended period of time without glancing at the menu and the guy got fed up and hungry since he couldn't insert a question about what to order into the wall of your discourse since he lacked masonry tools.  He's still an asshole for not asking the rest of you what you wanted to order, but that would make the difference between a N-T-A and an E-S-H.", "NTA. It is basic etiquette to let someone order themselves. Even if they're treating, that doesn't mean their teenage son can just order for you. This is a very weird scenario.", "NAH Your friend seems to think this is how you 'host' people. You reasonably want a say in the choices. I bet he feels he's being generous and taking care of everything, providing options. There's an easy middle ground here.", "If your friend paid, get over it. Some people like to be treated to a meal more than they insist on picking familiar things from a menu. If that is not you, then talk to your friend or dont go out to dinner.", "NTA, it was rude af for him to do that.", "NTA\n\nJust talk to him about it. 3 decades of friendship and you need to get input from strangers?\n\nMost of us haven\u2019t even been alive for that long. Not me, I\u2019n old", "NTA.\n\nBut his walking off to order food would\u2019ve been my cue to chat with my partner about what we wanted and then go order it.\n\nIt would not occur to me he\u2019d order for the table unless otherwise discussed.", "NAH depending on how you addressed it. And did you bring it up the first time he did it?\n\n\nYou say he hasn't spoken to you since, but not what you said. There's a difference between \"Hey, thank you so much for dinner, but in the future, I prefer to choose my own meal if we are going out.\" VS \"Hey man, we're at a restaurant. Why are you ordering for me?! That's rude.\"\n\n\nIt sounds like he viewed this as hosting. If you go to someone's house for a dinner party, they aren't taking everyone's order, so he was treating it as if he was throwing a dinner party for you. You don't go into someone's house and peruse the cabinets, looking for what you want them to cook for you.\n\n\nIf someone schedules a party at a restaurant, usually there is a pre set menu, not the whole menu.\n\n\nAnd, as you said, there were heaps of food. So maybe he thought that ordering a lot of different foods for everyone to try is the best way to host, rather than make someone feel limited to one entree. There have been a lot of posts lately about how when you go out as a group and someone else is paying, you should try to match their price point, it leads to an awkward balance of what to order.", "NTA Man!!! Even If I'm giving treat to my friends, we discuss & order...", "YTA I mean yeah it's weird but you're taking your annoyance a little too far. The dude bought you a bunch of food. Relax.", "I\u2019m voting ESH because you were at a restaurant where people order food, but instead of ordering food,  you were in the middle of a story. You also say that you like to discuss what everyone else is getting and the various menu options. I probably would have gotten up and ordered something too, which would have been rude, and therefore I also think your friend was in the wrong. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say they were ready\u201d did you give them a chance to say anything? It were you just telling a story and not reading the room? We\u2019re they engaged in the story or just hming and yeah-ing in all the right places while waiting for you to finish? I do think you should talk to your friend and LISTEN to them. Let them know they hurt you, but be open to dialogue.", "Info- did he get food you were OK with eating? \n\nDid you eat the food he ordered, or did you go order your own after your story? \n\nDid he request you pay him back for the food he ordered?", "ESH  ... Him for ordering for the table without consideration.... and you for continuing to go out to a meal with him KNOWING he has a habit of doing this", "NTA. That is very odd behavior. I can sort of understand your friend's actions in a narrow setting: you're all starved, lots of ideas are being thrown around, but no one is making a decision, so the friend makes an executive decision for the group based on the current discussion. But to just decide without any semblance of discussion? Odd.\n\nI'd be put out too. I enjoy trying new things when dining out, but when people order for me, it's nearly always something \"safe\" and boring.", "He has no idea if you have any restrictions or recent allergies. \n\nNta", "My input is that his extraordinary behavior is unbelievable. I would have left. NTA.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t think too much of him not responding to your message. At this point in his life he may feel it\u2019s more important for him to order for the table without asking and not really listening to his friends story. I\u2019d probably avoid going out to eat with him for a while or at the very least state in the dinner plans that I\u2019d order what I chose or I\u2019d have to sit this dinner out.", "ESH. He is an AH for ordering for you, BUT you heard him say he was going to order something and you watched him go. You could have spoken up and asked him what he was doing and told him that you hadn't made a decision yet.", "NTA ugh! I hate when people order for me!  \n\nReminds me of when I was in New Zealand and overheard a date that was going like wildfire. Then the guy ordered for the woman. Immediately crashed the vibe.", "NTA \n\nI would loathe someone ordering for me, particularly without my input.", "NAH\n\nMaybe the 16 year old thought he was helping out by letting the grownups converse while he got food.\n\nMaybe the 16 year old was hungry, or had studying to do and wanted to get things moving along\n\nBut I'd cool your horses on this, and the next time you all go out, BEFORE you're at the restaurant, have a conversation or text with you best friend and tell him how much you like seeing 16-yo but would it be OK if you and you wife order your own food?\n\nIt sounds like you guys were chatting, he was hungry and wanted to get going, and it didn't seem like ordering was imminent, so he took initiative.\n\nI see no problem with that, just miscommunication if you're this upset by it.", "Was there no Grey Poupon?

If individual plates, that's just straight up weird and I'd be totally irritated.\n\nEdit to add:  you have a role in this too. Conversations are fine, but the restaurant and servers are there to make a living, not host a coffee klatch for customers who aren't ordering. Etiquette suggests that when you arrive, you should get down to business fairly quickly. Peruse the menu and order fairly promptly, then you can have whatever meandering conversation you want to. \n\nI'd be irritated if someone ordered for me, but I'd also be irritated if I went there to eat, and someone at the take wanted to sit and chat endlessly without getting to the business of food.

That's just weird by itself, maybe pick an appetizer that you want the whole table to try but don't order people's food for them if they didn't ask for it.  Only question I have is did he pay, or make you all split the check?", "I\u2019m confused\u2026 did he invite you out and pay for all the food? I mean, it\u2019s weird that he doesn\u2019t ask what you like, but have you tried ordering something for yourself when you\u2019re not digging the fare?\n\nIf you\u2019re paying for what he\u2019s ordering without asking your input, then of course you\u2019re NTA.", "Literally Dennis Reynolds on IASIP does that and not the most well adjusted guy in the world. And his friends hate when he orders for them.", "Lol yea, alot of people are confused. At one point he said at the end of the 10 minutes the punchline didn't land. And that's when friend walked away.\n\nI wonder if friend just ordered stuff like appetizers, and OP is like, \" I don't like any of this\" and it wasn't like the friend ordered everyone's main course.", "I get the feeling that your 'story' may have been going on for just a bit too long and everyone was over it.   I'm guessing that you didn't notice that.   \n\nPerhaps they have been through this drama with you before and knew that if someone didn't take action they would still be sitting there at 10pm with you trying to decide just which dishes to order.\n\nMaybe an 'executive decision' was needed.", "I REFUSE to pay if someone order something without asking me what i want to eat.. \n\nYou better talk with your friend that he is being uneducated and an ass hole to just ask for food without even asking anyone in the table what dish everyone want...", "No buddy. \ud83d\udc4e that's a whole lot of negative assumption. I deal in facts, love and fairness.", "I would still expect them to check if there was anything specific I wanted or didn't want so they could take that into account", "I mean if the joke was 5 minutes long then probably \ud83d\ude02", "As far as I'm concerned, if you can't give your meal order along with your drink order, you need to speed it up.", "Everyone is trying to eat and OP is over here doing stand up"]}
