Feeling perplexed that he just walked off with no real explanation of what he was ordering. 15 mins later a heap of food arrives. Now we had no idea about what kind of food nor did he ask but he has done this before and last time it happened he just kind of took control of the food without asking. I wasn't really into the food and am the kind of diner who likes to look at the menu and discuss with my wife and dinner partners what our choices are,   these decisions are often taste based and sometimes financial. \nAnyway back to dinner- besides feeling brushed off with him walking off midway through a story I was telling and  i feeling quite annoyed as I feel like he had taken liberties and didn't take into consideration what others wanted. Not even a question of whether we we ready. Now I'm happy to be treated out as someone's guests but it just feels odd to not be asked and have someone control a table like that.\nI did say to him that I felt put out because ordering is a collective effort but he hasn't contacted me since.\nAITA here?\nKeen to hear your input .", "created_utc": 1683290881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138kokm/aita_for_opposing_my_friends_dinner_order/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If i go out to eat no one tells me what i order without asking me first. I don't know what he was thinking for real.", "NTA What kind of freak picks what everybody is having to eat when at a restaurant? Even if he was paying it's very odd behaviour. NTA. I think your friend is probably not worth bothering with honestly. Seems self obsessed.", "Info: How long after sitting down at the restaurant did he get up to order?\n\nHis behavior was definitely rude, but I\u2019m wondering if you were so into your conversation you might\u2019ve also been making the table wait longer to order food which is also quite rude.", "How long had the convo been going on? Did it appear he tried to find a break in the convo to ask about food? You said you like to take a while to order. Maybe he was tired of waiting for you to finish your story, read the menu, and confer with your wife. Is he (who ordered the food), the 16 year old son or the husband of the couple? Why, after waiting 5 or 10 minutes did you not get suspicious and go check with the person who left instead of just continue talking? \n\nI just wonder if you weren\u2019t being one of those people who talks and talks and talks without recognizing social cues. Like everyone else being hungry and ready to order", "NTA. Your friend is weird and controlling. Who does that?", "NTA\n\nThis is the weirdest story I've heard all week.", "This is odd but I\u2019m getting the sense that he hosted and paid for everything?  With this long of a history, I\u2019m thinking there is a reason he acts this way.  Maybe he wanted a particular vibe for the meal he was throwing for people, maybe he didn\u2019t want to wait for what he expected to be a long process for you to finish your talking, peruse the menu, debate and negotiate choices etc.  Maybe he feels like his generosity in paying gets taken advantage of people guests ordering the most expensive thing every time when he\u2019s paying\u2026 who knows.  Maybe it was a family style meal like buca de peppos and he wanted to get it started and get people home for commitments you didn\u2019t know about and he knows your stories and process are long winded and he thought letting you go on while he took care of business was the least obtrusive\u2026 \n\nI do think your comment about wanting to choose what he buys you was a little offputting, I can see myself thinking someone I hosted for a meal was rude if they ate, didn\u2019t pay and then bitched.  \n\nI feel like there is more here because of the length of the relationship.  The solution is to pay for yourself going forward", "NTA\n\nYou should order your own food. It is beyond controlling to order food for the whole table.", "NTA: Just because he is paying for the food doesn\u2019t mean he gets to control what you eat.. it seems like that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s paying for it honestly. I mean, why would someone order food for everyone unless they want control and for everyone to have what they think is best.", "NTA\n\nIt's bad etiquette to order for everyone without asking for input.", "INFO: How long was this story you were telling?  Was this a sit-down or order-at-the-counter restaurant.\n\nBecause I can easily see this being a scenario where you were droning on for an extended period of time without glancing at the menu and the guy got fed up and hungry since he couldn't insert a question about what to order into the wall of your discourse since he lacked masonry tools.  He's still an asshole for not asking the rest of you what you wanted to order, but that would make the difference between a N-T-A and an E-S-H.", "NTA. It is basic etiquette to let someone order themselves. Even if they're treating, that doesn't mean their teenage son can just order for you. This is a very weird scenario.", "NAH Your friend seems to think this is how you 'host' people. You reasonably want a say in the choices. I bet he feels he's being generous and taking care of everything, providing options. There's an easy middle ground here.", "If your friend paid, get over it. Some people like to be treated to a meal more than they insist on picking familiar things from a menu. If that is not you, then talk to your friend or dont go out to dinner.", "NTA, it was rude af for him to do that.", "NTA\n\nJust talk to him about it. 3 decades of friendship and you need to get input from strangers?\n\nMost of us haven\u2019t even been alive for that long. Not me, I\u2019n old", "NTA.\n\nBut his walking off to order food would\u2019ve been my cue to chat with my partner about what we wanted and then go order it.\n\nIt would not occur to me he\u2019d order for the table unless otherwise discussed.", "NAH depending on how you addressed it. And did you bring it up the first time he did it?\n\n\nYou say he hasn't spoken to you since, but not what you said. There's a difference between \"Hey, thank you so much for dinner, but in the future, I prefer to choose my own meal if we are going out.\" VS \"Hey man, we're at a restaurant. Why are you ordering for me?! That's rude.\"\n\n\nIt sounds like he viewed this as hosting. If you go to someone's house for a dinner party, they aren't taking everyone's order, so he was treating it as if he was throwing a dinner party for you. You don't go into someone's house and peruse the cabinets, looking for what you want them to cook for you.\n\n\nIf someone schedules a party at a restaurant, usually there is a pre set menu, not the whole menu.\n\n\nAnd, as you said, there were heaps of food. So maybe he thought that ordering a lot of different foods for everyone to try is the best way to host, rather than make someone feel limited to one entree. There have been a lot of posts lately about how when you go out as a group and someone else is paying, you should try to match their price point, it leads to an awkward balance of what to order.", "NTA Man!!! Even If I'm giving treat to my friends, we discuss & order...", "YTA I mean yeah it's weird but you're taking your annoyance a little too far. The dude bought you a bunch of food. Relax.", "I\u2019m voting ESH because you were at a restaurant where people order food, but instead of ordering food,  you were in the middle of a story. You also say that you like to discuss what everyone else is getting and the various menu options. I probably would have gotten up and ordered something too, which would have been rude, and therefore I also think your friend was in the wrong. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say they were ready\u201d did you give them a chance to say anything? It were you just telling a story and not reading the room? We\u2019re they engaged in the story or just hming and yeah-ing in all the right places while waiting for you to finish? I do think you should talk to your friend and LISTEN to them. Let them know they hurt you, but be open to dialogue.", "Info- did he get food you were OK with eating? \n\nDid you eat the food he ordered, or did you go order your own after your story? \n\nDid he request you pay him back for the food he ordered?", "ESH  ... Him for ordering for the table without consideration.... and you for continuing to go out to a meal with him KNOWING he has a habit of doing this", "NTA. That is very odd behavior. I can sort of understand your friend's actions in a narrow setting: you're all starved, lots of ideas are being thrown around, but no one is making a decision, so the friend makes an executive decision for the group based on the current discussion. But to just decide without any semblance of discussion? Odd.\n\nI'd be put out too. I enjoy trying new things when dining out, but when people order for me, it's nearly always something \"safe\" and boring.", "He has no idea if you have any restrictions or recent allergies. \n\nNta", "My input is that his extraordinary behavior is unbelievable. I would have left. NTA.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t think too much of him not responding to your message. At this point in his life he may feel it\u2019s more important for him to order for the table without asking and not really listening to his friends story. I\u2019d probably avoid going out to eat with him for a while or at the very least state in the dinner plans that I\u2019d order what I chose or I\u2019d have to sit this dinner out.", "ESH. He is an AH for ordering for you, BUT you heard him say he was going to order something and you watched him go. You could have spoken up and asked him what he was doing and told him that you hadn't made a decision yet.", "NTA ugh! I hate when people order for me!  \n\nReminds me of when I was in New Zealand and overheard a date that was going like wildfire. Then the guy ordered for the woman. Immediately crashed the vibe.", "NTA \n\nI would loathe someone ordering for me, particularly without my input.", "NAH\n\nMaybe the 16 year old thought he was helping out by letting the grownups converse while he got food.\n\nMaybe the 16 year old was hungry, or had studying to do and wanted to get things moving along\n\nBut I'd cool your horses on this, and the next time you all go out, BEFORE you're at the restaurant, have a conversation or text with you best friend and tell him how much you like seeing 16-yo but would it be OK if you and you wife order your own food?\n\nIt sounds like you guys were chatting, he was hungry and wanted to get going, and it didn't seem like ordering was imminent, so he took initiative.\n\nI see no problem with that, just miscommunication if you're this upset by it.", "Was there no Grey Poupon?

Or was this individual plates, like \"I'll have a cheeseburger and Fred will have a French dip\"?\n\nIf pizza, I think your friend is not really an AH, but he def could have sought input from everyone. If individual plates, that's just straight up weird and I'd be totally irritated.\n\nEdit to add:  you have a role in this too. Conversations are fine, but the restaurant and servers are there to make a living, not host a coffee klatch for customers who aren't ordering. Etiquette suggests that when you arrive, you should get down to business fairly quickly. Peruse the menu and order fairly promptly, then you can have whatever meandering conversation you want to. \n\nI'd be irritated if someone ordered for me, but I'd also be irritated if I went there to eat, and someone at the take wanted to sit and chat endlessly without getting to the business of food. Yes, he may have been out of line, but you need to evaluate your own manners too. If he's hungry, your story can wait. Order your damn food in a timely manner. ESH", "INFO: What was the kind of food? Was it family style/sharing focused? Does he belong to the same culture as the restaurant?", "Is he paying?", "NTA\n\nnext time he does that split the check and get what you want,  maybe if he has to pay for stuff no one shares he will stop", "NTA. I\u2019m very picky and would be extremely annoyed if someone ordered for me in this instance. He should have at least given you a heads up.", "I don't think you're an AH, but I have friends that take FOREVER to order food.  I have been know to pull out my phone or kindle during these extensive discussions that continue 20-30 minutes after I have already decided what I want.  Wouldn't have ordered for anyone else, but if I'm really hungry or have time constraint (lunch and work) I will order my food while they are still discussing.", "NTA, the only scenario I can think of where this would be even remotely ok is if the orderer is introducing their favorite restaurant or their culture\u2019s cuisine to the others and he\u2019s getting a  bunch of different things for everyone to try, like someone from Greece taking friends to an authentic Greek restaurant for the first time for example.

No food was discussed at all he just got up midway through a story I was telling him .

Extreme reaction to jump up to order for everyone rather than just budging the group to order already.", "Could be be in the spectrum? You said he's walked off when you were talking before", "Yeah idk. It certainly wasn\u2019t a polite way for them to handle it. I think there is probably just a miscommunication happening. I think it would be fine to ask about it next time you see them. But you certainly haven\u2019t done anything to be labeled an asshole.

They're hungry ALL THE TIME.  \n\nI can totally see that if it looked like there was going to be 20 minutes+ of conversation, THEN discussions over ordering, THEN another 15 minutes before food arrived - that's 45 minutes, and for hungry boy (I am sure you remember when you were that age!) it must have seemed like an eternity. lol", "Take my upvote!", "Sure thing.
