My mother in law said no and said that I specifically was ruining their families tradition. She said we should all go to the restaurant still and the two of us should just eat beforehand. I still have no interest in watching everyone else eat. My husband and I are refusing to join them and are instead making plans to spend Christmas Eve with my family.

I'm a big tradition person. But when family informs you that tradition is MORE IMPORTANT than actual family members and their health and happiness? Yeah, no . . . something is really wrong with that. The whole point of traditions is to bring joy. The tradition itself doesn't have feelings. It's not going to be hurt if they change it. But you will if they keep it up.\n\nWhat they're doing is hurtful. You have every reason to point that out and say, \"No thank you.\" Go spend time with the family who actually value you.", "NTA.   \n\n\nFirst, an invitation is not a summons, and you are free to decline an invitation for any reason.  \n\n\nSecond, you can not eat dairy, and your husband can not now either, so it would be awkward for you both to be there watching everyone else eat, not to mention bad manners on your in-laws' part doing that.   \n\n\nThird, you offered a perfectly reasonable compromise of everyone making homemade pizzas that everyone can eat and enjoy, and your in-laws shot that down for no good reason at all. On a side note, this would've just enriched the family tradition even more because cooking together can a very fun, bonding thing to do, especially if everyone were to choose an ingredient of their own to add to a pizza, and thus make cool combinations.  \n\n\nYour in-laws are just being childish and narcissistic with this \"my way or the highway\" attitude. You and hubby, and who ever else wants to try out your idea of making homemade dairy-free pizzas should go right ahead and make your own family tradition.", "I don't even know how/why people ask these things: No, OP, NTA.

You  are making new traditions with your family.  That's a right of passage as little birds fly from the nest and become their own big birds.\n\n\"We were told we are ruining Christmas for the whole family.\"\n\nBS.

They could pick a different restaurant to include you, and now that their son can't eat there either, they should be willing to find a different restaurant, or respect that you won't be going. \n\nI get that this is their tradition, and it totally sucks to change traditions, but if the tradition is about celebrating with family, then actually having all the family there should be the guiding principle of the event.", "NTA.

The fact she expects 100% is ridiculous, and you (or rather, your husband) should be able to squash any claims that you are ruining anything based on this alone. \n\nThen the whole food thing, is a whole other can of worms. Food intolerances are in varying degrees, from 'very mild reaction' to 'unless transported to the ER in minutes, will die'. SOME yearly traditions trump the 'very mild reaction', so it's not so cut-and-dry here, but yeah, you're an adult, and you and your partner get to decide what to do for christmas eve, and attending a meal you can't partake in would be not-so-high on my list either.", "NTA \n\nStart your own traditions", "NTA The holiday season is supposed to be about spending time with family and showing love and care for others.

Once we got married it was expected I would join the family for this. Problem is, I cannot eat dairy and this particular restaurant only has pizza (no dairy free food at all).

She can eat beforehand or bring her own food. Again, I deal with this all the time, but with *more* restrictions than OP. When you have dietary restrictions, you have responsibility to find your own solutions, even if that means doing something unconventional.", "No. I specifically said she is NOT an asshole for making the request. The problem is she is only willing to participate if they change their tradition for her. It's not unreasonable for her to eat beforehand or bring her own food to eat at the restaurant. Again, I have done both of these myself on the regular because I have to be gluten and dairy free for medical reasons. It's nice when people can accommodate your special needs, but its not always possible. A whole family should not have to change a long-standing tradition because one or two people don't want to feel left out.\n\nAlso, what boundary do you think she is setting here? No one is asking her to starve, and if her \"no dairy\" requirement is severe, it won't be the only time a family gathering has food she can't eat. Is she going to skip every birthday party unless the hosts provide dairy free cake and ice cream? I sure hope not, because both this holiday meal and every birthday party are about family gathering together, NOT the food. Again, she needs to learn how to accommodate her own dietary needs instead of expecting others to do it for her.", "WHAT?  \n\nI thought it was a twenty or forty year family tradition!
