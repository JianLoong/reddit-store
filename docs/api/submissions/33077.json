{"id": 33077, "submission_id": "18j0ukk", "title": "AITA for not sending out thank you cards to guests who came to my baby shower?", "selftext": "I (27f) and my fianc\u00e9 (26f) recent had our first baby at the end of October. We live far from both of our families (the closest being 5 hours away) and have few friends that live around us. Because of this, I opted out of having a baby shower. My fianc\u00e9s parents and their friends decided they were going to throw a baby shower for me, which while I was very grateful that they would be willing to do that, I was against the idea because I didn\u2019t even know their friend that offer to host the shower, and I wouldn\u2019t know 99% of the guests and the thought of going to a party dedicated to me and my baby with a bunch of people I don\u2019t know getting me gifts was something that made me uncomfortable. They insisted. Come the day of the shower, we travel 5 hours to my in-laws friends house that hosted and she went ALL OUT, even getting handmade soaps made with my baby\u2019s name on them. This made me even more uncomfortable (I grew up in a low income household, so I am not used to this kind of thing). I didn\u2019t know anyone there and just felt very out of place, it felt more like a party for my in laws than anything. At the end of the shower I thanked everyone profusely, especially the host, going so out of their way for someone they never met. Come a month later, my baby got delivered 5 weeks early because I had preeclampsia and she was under 5lbs. My fianc\u00e9 and I had to send a lot of money getting premie stuff, we also decided that since I only had 8 weeks of unpaid maternity leave that I wouldn\u2019t be going back to work, as our daughter was premature and the cost of childcare around where we live would be more than half of my salary /month. Deciding to become a one-income household and having a new baby, plus it being so close to xmas we are making big sacrifices to be able to afford to give our baby the best life. That brings us to now, after having an argument with them that we weren\u2019t going to travel 5+ hours with a newborn to spend her first xmas with them, they expressed that they (and some guests) were VERY upset we hadn\u2019t sent out thank you cards yet since they had gone so out of their way. I never asked to have a baby shower and even was against the idea at first. I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful, I am very grateful and have expressed so endlessly, but I don\u2019t even know the names of most of the people that came, let alone their addresses to send them a card! They also know that we are trying to save as much money as possible to be able to compensate for my loss of income and spending money on thank you cards and postage seems unnecessary to me.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I\u2019ve never received a thank you card from any gift I\u2019ve given at a baby shower nor did I ever expect one.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1702649118, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j0ukk/aita_for_not_sending_out_thank_you_cards_to/", "score": 541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If anything your husband can send the cards since these are his people in the first place. NTA", "NTA. This whole comment  section is so bizarre to me. Thank you cards are for when the gift giver did not watch you open the presents and was not thanked personally at the time. They are not something to do in addition to thanking someone in person at the time.", "ESH.  You have a lot going on, but yes, you need to send thank you notes.  These people spent time and money doing something nice and trying to establish a bond with you.  This doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal and your husband needs to do half the work. Get the addresses from your MIL.  You can get thank you notes from Walmart or Amazon for about $10 for a box of 25. Create a template of 4 basic sentences to use and modify only to personalize:  \u201cThank you so much for the XXX.  It will be very helpful in bathing/feeding/cuddling/dressing Baby.  As you may have heard, Baby came early so it\u2019s been an exciting but exhausting time for us. It was nice to meet you at the shower, and I hope you to see you again next time we visit.\u201d Assuming about 20 people came, you can finish this project in an hour and for under $25.", "NTA I have given plenty of baby shower gifts and received precisely one card in return. It was nice to get one but it never bothered me not to receive one. All these Y T A seem overblown- even if thank you cards are the norm for this group of people they can give the parents of a brand new premie baby some grace. \nI also find it somewhat condescending that some commenters to assert that because their social norm is to send a thank you card all those who don\u2019t are rude and ill-mannered (just feels a bit classist)\n\nIf you are planning on doing something get your fianc\u00e9 to sort it- when in-laws are causing a fuss it makes sense for the relevant partner to step in- she would be more likely to know who these people are anyway (also presumably she would have known ahead of time that thank you cards were expected?)", "NTA. You thanked everyone who gave you a gift at the shower, correct?  Anyone who didn't get a personal thank you deserves a thank you note.  I never expect (and don't think I have received) a thank you note if I was thanked in person.\n\nGood luck with the baby.", "NTA! I did not send thank you cards for my baby shower either. Plus you had your baby early. You dont necesarly have the money for all those cards and stamps. She can mail them out if she wants them so bad. I've never once heard anyone being butt hurt over not getting a thank you card.", "You need to send thank you cards.  I'm not going to call you the A, since you have had a lot of stuff going on, *and there is still time to fix this*, but it seems like you're looking for excuses to not thank people for gifts they gave you.  You don't mention your husband has a broken hand or is illiterate - is there any reason he can't do it?  Nobody likes writing thank you notes, but it's something you should do.  Have your husband ask your in-laws for the names and addresses and just get it over with.", "You thanked everyone in person at the time,  the expectation for thank you cards if you thank someone in person needs ti go away.  If you opened the gifts at a later date then you should send a thank you card.", "\"... it felt more like a party for my in laws than anything.\"\n\nYou hit the nail on the head there. This wasn't about you, it was about them wanting to look good under the guise of throwing you a party. If they really cared about you and wanted to help you, they might have quietly bought some stuff for you and offered to do things like come clean your house, prep some meals, help set up the nursery, etc.. You know... things you might have actually wanted.\n\nWhile it would've been nice to thank the hosts via a card, expecting you to spend time and money on several cards to several people WHO YOU DIDN'T KNOW AND HAD NO WAY OF CONTACTING, esp. while you were dealing with a premie baby, preeclampsia, and leaving your job (!), is asinine!\n\nYou thanked everyone profusely in the moment. That was enough. The fact that your in-laws expect you to travel 5+ hours with a newborn and getting butthurt when you tell them 'no' tells you everything you need to know about them. They don't care about you, they only want what they want when they want it. I hope your partner is the kind of person to stand up for you because I sense some more issues like these popping up in the future.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Is it an established thing to send them? Yes. IMO, is having a baby a pretty good excuse not to? Also yes. \n\nBaby showers are an event I would expect grace on a thank you card being sent as they are usually hosted soon before GIVING BIRTH, which you also did earlier than expected.\n\nI will point out on the saving money side of things, having a shower and getting necessities probably did help with that a good bit. If you wanted to keep the peace, I do think you and your husband could knock it out in an afternoon for relatively cheap. \n\nBut I think it's weird they told you people were upset... who gets upset about that instead of assuming it was lost in the mail or acknowledging you had the baby early? NTA", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted for this but whatever.  NTA.  You said thank you at the shower to the guests and the host.  That is enough.  Paper cards are a waste of money and time especially because when people receive them they open them, take one look, and throw them away.  You\u2019ve done enough especially since you didn\u2019t ask or want this party to begin with.  If thank you cards are so important to your in laws, have them send them.", "NTA. This is definitely a cultural/generational thing. I sent thank you cards after my baby shower because I knew that a lot of my older relatives would expect it, especially since a shower is a little more formal event. I also hadn\u2019t had the baby yet so I had plenty of time to write them. In my experience, most people don\u2019t send them anymore though. I\u2019m fine with being thanked in person.\n\nSince it\u2019s her family, your partner maybe should have remembered that it was important to them and made an effort to get them sent out, but it\u2019s also understandable that it wasn\u2019t a high priority after the baby was premature.\n\nHowever, now that you know, you should send them. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy.", "NTA - I had every intention of sending out thank you cards after my baby shower, then my twin boys decided to come 6-weeks early, between the time at the NICU and not being home for a month (stayed at the Ronald McDonald house since we lived an hour away from the hospital), the d/c from the hospital and the overall care for twin premie infants, that plan went to hell in a handbasket. \n\nThe boys are going to be 4-months in 2-weeks and just now do I feel like I\u2019m treading water instead of drowning. You thanked them in person, it\u2019s enough! Your main responsibility now is caring for yourself and premie newborn.", "This might be a cultural thing but I've never once seen thank you cards after attendence of anything. (Baby showers also aren't a thing here) \n\nYou thanked them in person, several times. Why do they need it in writing? Thats just weird.  Absolutely NTA", "NTA. At least in my family, thank you cards are expected at baby showers and graduation parties. But you didn\u2019t host the party and barely knew anyone there. If your in-laws wanted to send out thank you cards, they should\u2019ve told you that ahead of time, and done the brunt of the work (i.e. write down everyone\u2019s name, address, & what gift they gave).\n\nTheir lack of communication is the core of the problem and it\u2019s weird they chose to bring it up much later. That being said, I would just apologize to them for not sending out cards because you weren\u2019t aware it was expected. Then I would ask if they would be willing to help you rectify the situation, like maybe if they could get you all the supplies/info needed to send them out.", "Being MAD about thank you cards indicates they feel entitled to them. This makes you NTA. If they\u2019d expressed healthy disappointment or asked you to send cards even though they know it wasn\u2019t your idea, that would be different.", "How were the original invites sent out? If it was electronic or an email, then thank you's in the same format would be understandable, especially in such circumstances. You could send the message to whoever has the list of addresses and ask to send on your behalf, if people don't want you having their email addresses, since you're all strangers.\n\nCongratulations on the baby and becoming a family of 3!", "NTA. You thanked the people at the shower? Why send a card thanking them again? The other comments saying this is standard protocol must be richer than me. If anyone should be sending out thank yous it\u2019s the hosts aka your in laws and their friends. Thank you for coming etc etc. Your in laws could definitely do it on behest of their daughter.", "NTA. I personally don\u2019t expect thank you cards from a baby shower. I know the family/mother is going to give birth soon, is trying to prepare and is probably stressed - not to mention any medical issues that may be going on but aren\u2019t shared. \n\nIt\u2019s been six (6) weeks since the shower. I still think you have time to send thank you cards if you want to. Knowing you don\u2019t have peoples names or addresses, that info should/will have to come from your in laws.\n\nAnd if they haven\u2019t given it to you yet, then that\u2019s not your fault. You can ask them, but you can\u2019t make them give it to you. I understand thank you notes are \u201cproper\u201d etiquette. But if people give a gift with certain expectations of a pregnant person, then that\u2019s on them. \n\nYour health and baby\u2019s health is more important than thank you cards.", "Yeah, thank you cards are kinda standard. But it\u2019s not what they\u2019re upset about. They\u2019re just bringing it up now because you\u2019re the evil DIL who won\u2019t bring their new toy-I mean your baby to accessorize-I mean bond with.", "Personally, I'm of the boat that if you thank in person, you don't need to send thank you cards. Sure, it's nice, but in person is fine IMO.\n\nnta", "NTA. You told them to their face thank you. Why do you need to write it down too plus mail it off.", "NTA. I say thank you to their face in the moment, but that\u2019s just me. Personally, I can express gratitude easier that way. I also feel like if you\u2019re doing something nice and then you get mad for not being showered with praise in the mail afterwards you weren\u2019t doing it to be nice.\n\nI can understand you would be uncomfortable being pampered if you\u2019re not used to it but if you didn\u2019t say thank you at all, then YTA.", "Nta. I think it's so stupid to expect anyone to write out thank you cards. I think they should die out. Most people throw them away. And most people say to just write out a generalized thank you and half ass it so what's the point? \nIf you're gifting someone something just to recieve a kuddos for doing so, then you're an AH. The people who insisted on throwing you a shower should write thank you notes to THEIR guests.", " \nNTA - yes it\u2019s a bit gauche/uncouth to not send thank you notes, but it\u2019s also very much an unacknowledged class difference. As a fellow grew-up-poor, this was just not a ritual that we participated in. You\u2019re going to be judged for it, but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. \n\nIt\u2019s also tacky for them to guilt trip you about _not_ sending thank you cards, but nobody wants to talk about that. A truly gracious host would make accommodations for you, would not have pressured you out of your comfort zone, and would be running interference on your behalf with their offended friends. \n\nTruthfully, you will probably continue to run into this kind of class-based judgment from your in-laws and their friends. And if you want to move in and be accepted in their circles, you\u2019re going to have to learn and perform the social graces they expect. If you don\u2019t care about that, carry on as you wish.", "NTA, but now that you know it\u2019s an expectation, ask MIL to send you a list of who gave each gift as well as their full names and mailing addresses, and then send out thank you cards. It won\u2019t take long. If there was no list kept of who gave what, then get the addresses and write generic notes to each: \u201cThank you so much for attending my baby shower and for your thoughtful gift.\u201d Enclose a photo of baby as well, for bonus points.", "NTA. It'd be one thing if you planned it and all that jazz, but you didn't.\n\nPlus, cards are meant to be used for those *that weren't there to directly recieve their thanks*.\n\nThis feels much more like a \"we did this for you without you asking, so where's our reward?\" Which, while yes, is just a stupid card, but I hate when people pull that crap on me, especially people who have the money to splurge on stuff I wouldn't ever touch, and then they put all of that on me. I refuse to encourage that behavior by giving them what they insist that they deserve.\n\nI feel like it's older/wealthier people who get all pissed off when they do unasked stuff for others and don't get thanked for it. Do shit because you want to, not because you want to be thanked IMO", "NTA - the only time I sent thank you cards was for wedding gifts because we opened them without the gift giver there for me to thank in person.\n\nI hate thank you cards. If I look at you in the eyes and say \"thank you for coming and for gift\" then I have thanked you. Why do I need to spend money and send a card that you will read and throw away?\n\nThe whole concept is old fashioned and outdated. You said thank you to them, you don't need to write it down and send it in the mail.", "NTA", "NTA", "Honestly NTA, out of personal opinion. If i went to a baby shower and they thanked me personally for my gift, I would not care if i got a thank you card or not. Them being thankful in person would be enough for me. I\u2019m just glad to be invited places haha. \n\n  But if it were me, and I didn\u2019t see the person/people who got the gift when i opened it, I would send them a card for sure to let them know I thank them for it. :) however, thank you cards or goodie bags (especially for the person/people who set up the party) seem really sweet for *any* occasion as a little thank you for coming ect! \ud83e\udd70 i personally don\u2019t blame anyone who does not do that though, being there experiencing that is enough for me and them having the party is great in itself", "Ive never understood this \"etiquette' of doing something just because.  She thanked them PROFUSELY.  Not every culture or every family puts emphasis on this.  As long as you thank someone *profusely,* I dont understand why that thank you has to be handwritten and arrive in the mail.  This is out dated and a waste of paper products. NTA.", "NTA. How can you send thank you cards to people you don't even know?\n\nWhy did your MIL have someone you don't know host your baby shower instead of hosting herself?", "NTA you already thanked them at the shower right? I don't see why it's necessary to thank them again, especially with what you've had to deal with between then and now, except so they can pat themselves on the back. Imo thank you notes are for when you open a gift without the gift giver present. Plus it just seems like your in laws are using this as a way to guilt trip you", "The person that threw my baby shower actually collected the addresses of all the attendees and handed me a printed sheet of labels at the end of the party. With a pack of thank you notes. \n\nShe kept a checklist of what was given. \n\nI just checked the list thanked the person for whatever gift was given and then peel/stick the label on the envelope. \n\nESH.

Maybe I was raised with no class which is entirely possible. No I'm not Gen Z lmao", "In the future if people take the time to purchase or make you a gift, and someone throws you a party to give them: Please do not open a single gift until you get someone who is there to write down what gift was given and by whom as the gifts are opened.

While sending 'thank you' cards is a nice gesture, you'd have an easier time of it if you just tagged the guests on facebook and wrote one 'thank you' post, there.

We live far from both of our families (the closest being 5 hours away) and have few friends that live around us. Because of this, I opted out of having a baby shower. My fianc\u00e9s parents and their friends decided they were going to throw a baby shower for me, which while I was very grateful that they would be willing to do that, I was against the idea because I didn\u2019t even know their friend that offer to host the shower, and I wouldn\u2019t know 99% of the guests and the thought of going to a party dedicated to me and my baby with a bunch of people I don\u2019t know getting me gifts was something that made me uncomfortable. They insisted. Come the day of the shower, we travel 5 hours to my in-laws friends house that hosted and she went ALL OUT, even getting handmade soaps made with my baby\u2019s name on them. This made me even more uncomfortable (I grew up in a low income household, so I am not used to this kind of thing). I didn\u2019t know anyone there and just felt very out of place, it felt more like a party for my in laws than anything. At the end of the shower I thanked everyone profusely, especially the host, going so out of their way for someone they never met. Come a month later, my baby got delivered 5 weeks early because I had preeclampsia and she was under 5lbs. My fianc\u00e9 and I had to send a lot of money getting premie stuff, we also decided that since I only had 8 weeks of unpaid maternity leave that I wouldn\u2019t be going back to work, as our daughter was premature and the cost of childcare around where we live would be more than half of my salary /month. Deciding to become a one-income household and having a new baby, plus it being so close to xmas we are making big sacrifices to be able to afford to give our baby the best life. That brings us to now, after having an argument with them that we weren\u2019t going to travel 5+ hours with a newborn to spend her first xmas with them, they expressed that they (and some guests) were VERY upset we hadn\u2019t sent out thank you cards yet since they had gone so out of their way. I never asked to have a baby shower and even was against the idea at first. I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful, I am very grateful and have expressed so endlessly, but I don\u2019t even know the names of most of the people that came, let alone their addresses to send them a card! They also know that we are trying to save as much money as possible to be able to compensate for my loss of income and spending money on thank you cards and postage seems unnecessary to me.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I\u2019ve never received a thank you card from any gift I\u2019ve given at a baby shower nor did I ever expect one.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Start to finish,my verdict it that YTA. I do want to say (and sincerely mean) congratulations on the newest addition to your family. I am so thankful that both you & your LO are doing well. I can't imagine the stress giving birth early and having a premie would cause. That being said, the only part of your post that was relevant to your AITA question was the part where you received gifts and had a month to send out thank you cards but didn't. You spent it making excuses and justifications for not doing the right thing and acknowledging generosity. While, in the grand scheme of life, your LO being born ranks infinitely higher than baby shower thank you cards, in this situation it was really an unnecessary addition meant to elicit sympathy. Same with the whole long description of not wanting a shower or knowing anyone attending. While it was thrown against your wishes, YOU made the CHOICE to attend and to ACCEPT the GIFTS so generously given. You said yourself, the hostess went all out in celebration of the birth of your child. Maybe it did feel like it was really a party for your mother in law, but you and your SO were the ones benefitting from it as you didn't mention anywhere that your MIL took the gifts to her house. After this extremely generous gesture from people who hardly knew you, you spent a month afterwards unboxing, assembling, washing and folding these gifts in preparation for the arrival of your little one (I'm assuming. I could be wrong.) Yet, you couldn't be bothered to write a few sentences on some note cards in appreciation? I understand that you might not have everyone's addresses. My guess is that you do have your MILs address though. That is a perfect opportunity to make your MIL feel like she's helping. \"MIL, I truly appreciate the shower & gifts. I don't have everyone's address and we really can't swing all that postage right now. Could you do me a huge favor and let me mail all my thank you cards to you to hand out to your friends?\" or \" SO & I are swamped right now. Would you mind helping me address & stamp these envelopes?\" Honestly, it wouldn't matter if you didn't use a single one of the gifts, (which doesn't sound like the case) the attendees kindness and generosity in honor of you and your LO still deserve an acknowledgement. \n\nI realize that this isn't the case with everyone, but my siblings and I were raised to appreciate and show that we are grateful for the gifts we received. We were given the day they were received to play with new toys but on day 2 my mom expected to see our thank you notes ready to go. I remember using a crayon to scribble my name on thank you cards written for me by my mom for birthday gifts I received before I could write sentences. As we got older, we would write the cards and she would review, address, stamp & mail them, until we could do it ourselves. I realize that mail is becoming outdated. Which is sad because I don't know a single person who doesn't get a little thrill seeing a hand addressed letter in their mailbox. Even if you're one of the people who view mail as wasting resources or what have you, I'm certain your MIL has her friends email addresses. Hell, you didn't even take the lazy way out and thank everyone in a one size fits all Facebook post. To not completely lose all faith in humanity, I choose to believe that everyone who feels that ESH must have been taken in and fell for all of the poor me, I grew up poor and didn't know anyone and gave birth to a premie filler story. I made the choice to believe this while seeing a million examples everyday showing me that much of society really thinks that they're due the gifts they receive and their gratefulness is being expressed by the fact that they're not telling you that they should have been given more.

Wtf??", ">According to Emily Post:\nAll gifts should be acknowledged with a note\n\nEmily Post is outdated and old fashioned.

I hadn\u2019t slept more than a couple hour stretch in literally 6 weeks while providing round the clock hospice care for my grandmother and had to have emergency gallbladder surgery at week 2, then just jump back into being full time care 2 days later.\n\nAnyway, I started crying and then laughing and then I just couldn\u2019t stop. I wrote the exact same words in 100^+ cards. I didn\u2019t know what they were,  but I wrote them all.\n\nI decided then and there I would not do that again! So, when my grandfather died, I had a list of everyone I needed to thank, I addressed the envelopes, made a $ donation in their name to the animal shelter/rescue near us where we got his loving companion, and that\u2019s what the cards said- that a donation was made to thank them for their gift. \n\nI felt like I PAID to not have to make myself have a mental breakdown again, so them not receiving handwritten thanks from our family could be overlooked.\n\nI still had certain family members take issue- I told them to kick rocks. \n\nI am not suggesting OP do this, I had a micropreemie that was 13 weeks early and 1.9lbs.

I've been arguing all over the comment section that thank you cards are outdated and this is ridiculous. I copied the Emily post thing to show that you don't have to send a thank you card if you open a gift in person on front of the gift giver and say thank you to them in the moment.  Doesn't anybody care about the trees anymore?

Whenever I receive them, I truly appreciate them, and whenever I don't receive one, I remember and make a mental note to never give a gift or do anything thoughtful for that person.

There is a lot of talk about money being tight has a reason not to send the cards.  You can get a pack of cards at target for like $10.

Teaching children written communication skills is also tremendously important. It\u2019s atrocious how many adults are incapable of communicating effectively and courteously, mostly because they never learned how to do so.
