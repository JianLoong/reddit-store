Her toddlers are unruly, creating a lot of noise, jumping around, and dropping things on the floor. \n\nSince we have downstairs neighbors, this behavior isn't ideal. Her children then broke my large workout full-body mirror. While the adults were occupied cleaning up the mess, her son acted in a manner that caused harm to my daughter's eye as she sat by herself.\n\nI couldn't contain my anger any longer.

Why are you both such big pushovers for your SIL, including not turning her in for stealing from you?", "You need to sit down and talk to your wife. Explain that while you let your temper get the best of you (rightfully so IMO) what you said has to stand, the SIL is not allowed in the home. She\u2019s already stolen from you and you can\u2019t trust her and frankly you can\u2019t trust yourself not to give in to her. Apologize for the tone but not the message.", "ESH; SIL for obvious reasons and you because you keep allowing her to take advantage of you over and over again. Please learn to say no!", "Nta. Stop.

Stop letting her walk al over you and put your foot down.", "> We canceled our appointment, which we had been waiting for months to secure. I was already frustrated. As usual, she managed to squeeze some money out of us.\n\nWhat's really going on here?  Is your wife pressuring you to cave in when this happens?  If not, do you have no agency of your own?  Why not say \"no\"?\n\nNTA for snapping, but there are bigger problems at work here.", "NTA \n\n*No fucking way* I just read that right! Do you know how many boundaries she has stomped on?

She'll never stop asking for money if you guys keep giving it to her. A no its a NO. She won't leave the house? Call the cops and let they handle her and go to your appointment.

She can't make you give her anything, you are the one giving her \n\nNTA", "She is a thief and a liar and you continue to enable her. STOP NOW.... You are causing the problem by caving.

Your wife thought that hurting your daughter's eye was \"bothersome\". \nYou my friend have bigger problems than your SIL. You need to speak to your wife and try to get on the same page, ideally a different one than your SIL or consider your relationship. If my wife ever belittled someone injuring my daughter like the way yours has I could not look at her the same way. What mother could be so callous as to ignore that?\n\nHer issues of co-dependency with her sister that let her excuse whatever she does are superceded by her duty of care to her and your daughter.", "ESH.

Grow some spines.", "NTA - But you have a wife problem not a SIL problem", "I would have snapped a long time ago. NTA but you and your spouse will be major AHs if you keep enabling SIL. SIL needs an intervention", "NTA, but also - grow a spine", "NTA, but why have you been such a doormat? \n\nYou didn't have to stay, and even if one of you stayed out of  pity, the other one could have gone to the appointment. No way I would give up an appointment that it took months to get for the sake of some entitled AH. \n\nStart growing  a strong spine, and you won't keep running into this problem. You have to set firm boundaries with people like this.", "Look, I don't want to victim blame you here, but no is a full answer, which you have not followed through on.

You are doing this by choice.", "YTA because you let SIL walk all over you. She asks for money and you say no, but then by some miracle she gets it anyway. She wants to stay in your house and you say no because she steals, but rather than throw her out you cancel your own vaccination plans which were months in the making.\n\nAnd she lets her toddlers ran rampant and do damage and you do what? Just stand there?\n\nWhat does it take for abused people to say no and mean it?\n\nYes, you finally threw her out, supposedly for forever, but from the way you describe your relationship with her, it's dollars to doughnuts that she will wangle her way back into your lives.\n\nSorry, but none of this would have happened if, right from the start, you erected boundaries and maintained them.", "NTA.

Sounds like a fabulous place to live.", "This... she has trained the sister to keep pushing and OP will eventually give in. Do not open the door if she shows up. Do not allow her inside your home. Tell her that the Bank of OP is closed and if she insists on using her kids as leverage,  then you can happily call the country resources to assist her financially.  She will have to find someone else to fund het gambling addiction.

If she lets them sit a week or two, they'll be letting her walk all over them once again. \n\nOP, your SIL is sick and has a disease. You and your SO can't force her to get treatment, but enabling her and letting her walk all over your family only prolongs the illness and its effects on your family. Addictions like gambling are a poison that corrodes not just the person with it, but all of their surrounding friends and family. The sufferer begins to see them less as loved ones and more as tools to assist in getting their next fix. \n\nYou have already allowed her to bring direct harm to your child by cancelling that appointment, don't let her bring even more dangers into your household as she starts going to even more unscrupulous methods for loans and money.", "Wait, you own a pharmacy but you have to wait for a vaccination for your child? What? Can't you get vaccinations at pharmacies? I guess this is country-specific but it's confusing. \n\nAlso, why the heck did you cancel that vaccination appointment?

Stop enabling your SIL and start protecting your child.", " Don't give her any more money, and stop letting her into your home. Don't be doormats.

One of you could have stayed home, surely", "In my country, the sale of medicine is strictly regulated. We are only permitted to sell the medications that were included in the list we submitted when acquiring our pharmacy license. As a result, we are unable to offer newly released medications that were not included in our initial submission. \n\nAdditionally, obtaining a separate license for selling injections is a requirement, and it is common for smaller pharmacies to not offer this service. Our country's regulations differ from those in developed countries. \n\nHere, anyone with a degree and financial resources can apply for a license to sell medicine, regardless of their medical knowledge. This means that pharmacies in my country are more akin to regular shops rather than places with a distinctly medical atmosphere.\n\nRegarding vaccination appointment, it was arranged for all three of us, not exclusively for our child.
