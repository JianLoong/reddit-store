My SIL has two toddlers (a boy and a girl) and is currently pregnant with her third child. Financially, she is struggling due to her involvement in illegal lotteries, where she gambles whatever money she can access.\n\nWhenever she finds herself broke and in debt to informal loan providers, she emotionally manipulates us to obtain free money. She never accepts \"no\" as an answer when she asks for money and is determined to extract it from us, even if it's only partially. \n\nAdditionally, she borrows money from us and often fails to repay us. On the rare occasions she does pay us back, it's always an amount lower than what we lent her. She frequently calls or shows up unannounced at our house, catching us off guard.\n\nYesterday, after we informed her over the phone that we couldn't provide her with free money to repay yet another debt, she suddenly arrived at our place. We were about to leave for a vaccination appointment and told her so. \n\nWe explained that she needed to inform us in advance before visiting. She suggested that we go to our appointment while she waits at her house. However, due to past instances of her stealing from us, we didn't feel comfortable leaving her alone in our home.\n\nWe never confronted her about the thefts, but we definitely don't trust her with our house. We informed her that we would be gone for the entire day and that she should go back home. She insisted on staying, citing her tired toddlers as the reason. \n\nWe canceled our appointment, which we had been waiting for months to secure. I was already frustrated. As usual, she managed to squeeze some money out of us. Her toddlers are unruly, creating a lot of noise, jumping around, and dropping things on the floor. \n\nSince we have downstairs neighbors, this behavior isn't ideal. Her children then broke my large workout full-body mirror. While the adults were occupied cleaning up the mess, her son acted in a manner that caused harm to my daughter's eye as she sat by herself.\n\nI couldn't contain my anger any longer. I yelled at my SIL demanding that she leave my house immediately and never visit again.They left, but my wife expressed that even though the children were being bothersome, I was too harsh in my response, and it was somewhat rude to shout at her pregnant sister to leave. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684910295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qdpsi/aita_for_asking_my_sil_to_leave_my_house_and/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You suck for not putting up this boundary sooner. \n\nAlso, other solutions to provide assistance, because her children should not suffer because she wants to gamble her money away is to offer to take her grocery shopping (within reason) or buying her groceries yourself.

She also does not need to take her \"tired kids,\" to your home, if they are tired, they would be most comfortable at home. Your SIL's gambling issues and blatant disregard for her children is very concerning. Her bad behaviors seem to be escalating... stealing your things, dragging her children out to be manipulative into getting your money, and spending money she clearly doesn't have and should put towards her children.\n\nESH - SET CLEAR BOUNDARIES!

I don't blame OP for snapping, but he has only himself and his wife to blame for giving into her numerous times when they know she is a gambling addict involved in shady businesses.  No matter how much she pleads or begs or cries, they should have stuck to no. They should also have confronted her about her thefts but they didn't, so what exactly were they expecting?\n\nI would change the locks, get some ring cameras or something, and never allow her over again.

Helping others out is a choice, should not be forced on you, and should not just be a one-way street (you should receive help too when you need it).
