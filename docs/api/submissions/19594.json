However, I\u2019m unsure if they should be paid for that time because no one asked them to do it. Everything is about done in the house and now they tell my family they want to be paid hourly for their time.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your aunt and uncle are doing more than just physical labor. They're also doing EMOTIONAL labor that your parents are not doing. And yet your parents seem to think they deserve to benefit equally as your aunt and uncle from this? It would make total sense for your aunt and uncle to keep a greater portion of the house's sale to compensate for their extra labor. It's not \"helping family.\" It's putting the entire emotional load of going through your dead relative's home onto someone else's shoulders. YTA", "YTA. If the purpose, as I assume, is to get the house sold and then the money is split evenly between them and your parents, they should be paid for putting the work in to get it on the market.

That\u2019s LITERALLY what you\u2019re implying. GTFO with that.\n\nThe point is to sell the house and split the estate equally. Then both sets of adults should also invest into getting the house ready to go on the market equally. For your aunt and uncle that works best as the physical work.

My grandmother pulled this on my mom and stepdad (they were contractors at the time, with a crew) after my grandfather died and essentially guilted them into building a new roof onto the house so my grandmother could keep living there.

Your aunt and uncle are doing most of the work. Because of the work they're doing, it will be easier to sell the house and it could lead to a more profitable sale.

They may be sensing an attitude of entitlement from the family members not helping and it's making them mad.\n\nIt's not about the money for them.  It's about the fact that they are doing all the work to get the place ready for sale & no one is doing anything to help.\n\nIf your parents are unable to put in time on the renovations, they should be helping to pay for the supplies associated with the work.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA. You say they're money hungry yet you and your parents aren't doing most of the work on this house but you expect to benefit financially from it. You admit that it would cost a lot of money to hire people to do the work that your aunt and uncle are doing but you don't want them to get a cent.

Your family is going through a very difficult time and it's not fair for your aunt and uncle to be asking for money. You are all grieving your grandparents and trying to handle their estate, and you should be working together to manage their assets in a fair way. Your aunt and uncle are being selfish and taking advantage of your family's grief for their own financial gain, which is wrong and cruel. I know family matters are sometimes tricky to navigate, but you and your parents should stand together on this and not give in.", "NTA. Exactly who is supposed to pay them? I've cleaned out a few family member's houses after their deaths, and never have I heard of someone wanting to be paid. Ridiculous", "[deleted]", "NTA is my opinion. I find it kinda disgusting that uncle and aunt are keeping timesheets and nickel and diming the family over a bit of the inheritance for a few hours working on preparing the family house for sale. \n\nIf they had paid a contractor to do it, of course they should get that refunded. If they got an estimate from a contractor and then agreed to underbid that price and everyone agreed, great (especially if they have some relevant background experience). I don't know exactly how much they're asking for but I'm guessing well over $1000 (I am guessing it's $20 each and not $20 for both and say 40 hours could easily be spent, makes $1600 and that's assuming it's relatively fast and efficient and not something that's dragged out for months). I don't know the house or how much work it needed, but I don't trust family to be very efficient about it. If they put in a lot of necessary work that shows when the house sells, maybe the family should give them a bit of a larger share or at least take them to dinner as a thank you, but they don't get to present a bill for work done. Money brings out the greed and I feel like they're the ones being petty here (although it's hard to know without more knowledge about the scale of the work and experience and professionalism).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
