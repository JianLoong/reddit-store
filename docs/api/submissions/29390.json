It is your business to share/not share with whomever you want to. This is not happening to your husband. Therefore, \nhe should have kept his mouth shut.\n\nAlso, your husband should not treat you the way he does when u are upset. I won't give you advice on that because it's your marriage. Just know that that is not normal. \n\nNTA", "Your comment has been removed because it does not address the OP in good faith.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect a post breaks one of our rules, please report it instead of commenting. **Do not feed trolls**\r\n\r\nContinuing to post comments like this will lead to a ban.\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "I am aware, and like I said previously, if she is senile and can't help but blurt out inappropriate things at inappropriate moments, why would he even share that information with her? If she is so old that her brain is failing her, nobody should be giving her negative information that might cause her distress at all. Such a weird thing to argue about anyway.
