Whose fault is that? His -- for doing exactly what you had requested that he not do. He broke your confidence with the result that the job loss that you are still dealing with emotionally was suddenly exposed in front of a crowd with you completely put on the spot.", "INFO: is this a regular occurrence? I mean him getting mad at you when you\u2019re upset, particularly because of him? \n\nhonestly this is a SO problem. Not only did he go behind your back in a way you specifically told him it would cause you distress, but more worryingly in my opinion, he yelled at you for crying because of his betrayal of your trust. This is one thing, and I don\u2019t know how the rest of your relationship is, but this is a def red flag.", "NTA. You asked your husband not to say anything and he did the exact opposite.

Her repeating it was deliberate, and so was your husband\u2019s decision to ignore your wants and tell his grandma (who seems to dislike you based on her targeting) is rather telling. Definitely NTA. OP, please have a serious discussion with your husband about boundaries and privacy, what else is he willing to ignore? Asking him to keep quiet about it should\u2019ve made it clear you weren\u2019t comfortable with sharing it, hence setting a boundary.", "NTA. You asked your husband to keep your being laid off \"quiet for now,\" and he took that as he should not announce it to everyone, not put it on a billboard, but that it somehow it would of course be okay to tell his grandma. Who then mentions it in front of 50 people at a family event. Who could have predicted that she might do that?  Him. Your husband is TA, and is way off base to imagine for one second that you are unfairly being mad at his grandma for something that she would never have known about if he had just had done as you asked and kept his dang mouth shut.", "NTA, but losing your job isn\u2019t shameful. It happens to most people at least once. You say you\u2019re the breadwinner. Your husband can get a part time job and you can too, until you find something better.

I asked to not to tell anyone. You broke my trust. I am ONLY upset with YOU.\u201d\n\nAlso: \u201ci am too upset to see your family tonight. You need to tell them that i have a stomach bug. If you tell them (or even slightly imply to them) that i am staying away for ANY OTHER REASON then I will know that i cannot ever trust you, and i will divorce you.

This isnt the time to start breaking down as a team, so based on thar, yes YTA if you escalate things to do with his grandma.", "YTA. There is nothing shameful about losing your job. Also, when the breadwinner loses their job, it affects the entire family. This is not a dig at you but simply pointing out this also affects your husband. Your husband can talk to his family about things that stress him. You might want to reconsider tying so much self worth to having a jobbecause while it is normal to be upset about losing your job, it is not normal or healthy to be so ashamed and act like it is a dirty secret.", "INFO what did you ask your husband to do and not do? How did you confirm that he told his grandmother? \n\nWhen you say, \u201che gets mad\u201d what does that mean?

I\u2019m sorry you were laid off (it sucks but it\u2019s not exactly uncommon). Why keep this a secret? It\u2019s not a moral or professional failing. It\u2019s something that happened to you, not something *you* did. It says nothing about you. Why are you embarrassed about this? This would raise a red flag for me, and would be something to trigger a serious conversation with a significant other.

How your husband doesn't understand that you didn't want to share it with everyone is bizarre to me.", "And what does he do exactly? If you are the only breadwinner, he is what? What does he contribute other than being an AH who doesn't have enough respect for you to keep quiet about something you asked him not to talk about. Then his grandmother bringing it up publicly - she knew what she was doing. You have a terrible husband, and his family also sucks.", "Why isn't he working?", "Exactly! OP, you weren't upset at grandma so much as you ARE upset with him. Going from employed to not is quite understandably upsetting, especially if you've been at the job for awhile and have a close working relationship with your coworkers. You've just gone from breadwinner to $0 income, are stressed about getting new employment, needed time to adjust mentally and emotionally to the change before bandying it about. Your husband disrespected you and your wishes / needs, and any upset you have sits squarely with him.\n\nHopefully dinner goes ok.

Dude is just straight up wicked...", "This is the answer.", "Yeah I would say that whenever I get angry/emotional his response can be to get angry. In this situation he thought I was criticizing his grandma and got really hot about that.", "How is nobody mentioning the grandma bringing this up publicly on purpose?

I would never ask someone about their job loss in front of others.", "He works and it will be tight, but ok until I find another job", "Yeah I mean I did not convey to my husband that I thought his grandma was rude, but she was. It was rude.", "except she asked him not too, and he for some reason,told his grandma who must be the town cryer of the family", "He very much is, a very simple request from the woman he's supposed to love and support: \"please keep this quiet for now, I'm not ready for other people to know yet\" (temporary situation indicated by the language, she wasn't asking him to never tell anyone), was ignored. Maybe he knew the grandma would exacerbate the situation, maybe he didn't, we don't know that piece of the puzzle. But we do know that instead of taking the criticism of \"I asked for this thing, it was very important to me, you did the opposite, now I'm hurt and frustrated\" and apologizing, he got angry at her for having feelings", "I mean I shared it with my parents.

He was told to keep it quiet by his partner, and lacked the respect for her to accomplish that.", "There doesn't have to be shame involved; if someone is going through a fairly major life situation and requests the respect to go through that privately, they should be allowed that dignity. \"But they're family\" doesn't mean anything when they prioritize their desire to know over the relevant person's mental health.", "Though Grandma has no manners or tact.

This is not being supportive, hell I\u2019ll say he\u2019s actively hurting you more. I said there are red flags in my first comment, but this confirms my suspicions. This is emotional abuse. He is berating you for reacting to the pain he caused you. \n\nYour feelings are valid and deserve to be respected. you deserve to have someone who sees you\u2019re upset, and helps you because they love you.", "That\u2019s completely unacceptable in a grown man.

Feed it back to him like he is a toddler\u2014because emotionally, he is. \"I asked you to keep this quiet, and you did not.\" Then he will almost certainly rant. And then you say it again. Over and over and over and over just like that, every single time he makes any argument, you say, simply, \"it is not about anyone else. I asked you to keep this quiet, and you did not.\" Rinse and repeat.", "sounds like my mom lmao", "Yikes \ud83d\ude2c", "\"...whenever I get angry/emotional his response can be to get angry\"\n\nWell he responds to hurt feelings with anger, that is a problem. \n\nBut seriously, OP, I still suggest you consider forgiving him for telling his family about the layoff.  That is bad news for him as well as you, he's suddenly the sole breadwinner and it doesn't sound like he'll be able to meet the family's financial needs on his own, and many people in his position would seek emotional support from their own family.  Now it would have been nice of him to tell you that he'd talked to his family about the issue before you actually had to deal with the in-laws, but unless there are pre-existing boundaries you haven't talked about, perhaps this is more of a miscommunication issue than a real overstepping of boundaries.", "NTA- this is bad. I would really consider marriage counseling/individual counseling. Reading he responds like this made my sad on your behalf.", "Sounds good, OP. The average for finding jobs is 2 months. Don't let him badmouth you to anyone and you two could benefit from therapy to squash his tendency to be angry when you show any emotion. If he refuses then I suggest looking at other options.", "Stand up for yourself and call out grandma for making a public announcement.", "They're your in-laws but they're his family.

But in either case, they need to work together to fix their situation, not start tossing mud at each other, thats the point.", "She didn't mention her age, but my Mom is 79 she has ZERO filters or common sense at times.

Broken trust. This isn't a gender issue. This is a trust and respect issue. Two things he failed her on.", "LOL, fat chance! \n\nHow ridiculous is this, the major earner/possibly sole earner of the family has zero income now, and you think its realistic that he just eats it and doesnt say anything to any of his support system, even though it affects him greatly. Her request was unreasonable to say the least. \n\nThis is 100% skewed because of gender roles. If the man lost his job, everyone would be telling him to smarten up and go find another job, not to be mad at his wife being upset and confiding in others about the stability of the family budget.", "He also could have told her that he told his grandmother (who could've done better than to bring it up in front of his entire family of 50 people at a gathering), so that OP wasn't blindsided in front of, again, his entire family.", "LMFAO projecting, huh?"]}
