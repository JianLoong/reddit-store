I told him that it was getting annoying and he said \u201cit\u2019s a joke why are you so serious?\u201d  Which is when I told him that no one wants to be smelling farts all the time. He continued to do it anyways.\n\nWhile we cuddle whether it\u2019s on the couch or in bed I feel him push out a fart. When I confronted him on this he said it hurts his stomach and pushing it out prevents that. Despite me never feeling the need to push out a fart I left it alone.\n\nWhen I would be trying to sleep in bed he would come and try to fart on my face or get under the covers and fart while fanning the smell towards me. He would also push his butt up against me at night and when I would ask him to scoot over he says that he wants to be close to me which I have no problem with it\u2019s just the fact that he had farted on me while sleeping multiple times and I didn\u2019t want it to happen again. This time he actually listened and gave me space, he still does this at times however.\n\nAt any point during the day my husband would hack really loud and it sound as if he\u2019s trying to cough up some mucus. I rationalized that he has allergies but to do it every day and several times during movie time or long car rides  just got annoying and quite disgusting to hear. At this point it just triggers me every time he does it.

I also told him that there are ways to diagnose and combat whatever is making him be gassy and that a doctor could probably help with his throat problem.  I ended off the text by saying that these actions have made me less attracted to him and that it seemed as if he actively chose not to figure out the problem.\n\nHe never responded back.

We both live with other people when we're not farting around together, and neither of us behaves this way with most of those other people, because it's only funny when everybody's having fun. The cough thing is maybe a little more nuanced, but I bet your tolerance for hearing coughs would also be improved if you weren't already tired and grumpy from a long day of being farted on.
