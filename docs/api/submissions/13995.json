I told him that it was getting annoying and he said \u201cit\u2019s a joke why are you so serious?\u201d  Which is when I told him that no one wants to be smelling farts all the time. He continued to do it anyways.\n\nWhile we cuddle whether it\u2019s on the couch or in bed I feel him push out a fart. When I confronted him on this he said it hurts his stomach and pushing it out prevents that. Despite me never feeling the need to push out a fart I left it alone.\n\nWhen I would be trying to sleep in bed he would come and try to fart on my face or get under the covers and fart while fanning the smell towards me. He would also push his butt up against me at night and when I would ask him to scoot over he says that he wants to be close to me which I have no problem with it\u2019s just the fact that he had farted on me while sleeping multiple times and I didn\u2019t want it to happen again. This time he actually listened and gave me space, he still does this at times however.\n\nAt any point during the day my husband would hack really loud and it sound as if he\u2019s trying to cough up some mucus. I rationalized that he has allergies but to do it every day and several times during movie time or long car rides  just got annoying and quite disgusting to hear. At this point it just triggers me every time he does it.

I also told him that there are ways to diagnose and combat whatever is making him be gassy and that a doctor could probably help with his throat problem.  I ended off the text by saying that these actions have made me less attracted to him and that it seemed as if he actively chose not to figure out the problem.\n\nHe never responded back.

We both live with other people when we're not farting around together, and neither of us behaves this way with most of those other people, because it's only funny when everybody's having fun. The cough thing is maybe a little more nuanced, but I bet your tolerance for hearing coughs would also be improved if you weren't already tired and grumpy from a long day of being farted on.

NTA", "NTA but your dating a complete and utter child get rid of him he is absolutely sooooo gross what woman would be attracted to him if a lad done this to me he would be gone straight out the door. Even reading this nearly made me throw up my tea you deserve better then this trust me he will never change. Now he has resorted to the silent treatment and pouting which is very manipulating btw don't apologise to him ever", "Well, this is reddit so I am obligated to say: Divorce him! Divorce him now! Why haven't you divorced him yet?! Do it now!\n\nNTA", "If possible please stop sharing a bed with him.", "NTA.\n\nThis is how you get pink eye.", "NTA. He asked, you answered. It\u2019s not so much the bodily function as the childish manner in which he deals with them. Deathly fart? Nip outside or into a bathroom. Something in your throat? Cough discretely into a tissue, bin it and wash your hands. \n\nYou\u2019re asking him to act like an adult. That isn\u2019t exactly asking for a lot.", "NTA, you told him how you felt. Next time, leave the house for a week and tell him to cut his crap or next time it will be more then a week.", "nta lol", "OH HELLL NO", "NTA. Farting is a normal thing, his behaviour around it is not and I would be disgusted if my husband behaved like this. I have a terrible sense of humour and a lot of male friends so I'm exposed to laddish behaviour like this all the time. It can be funny among friends but it's definitely not sexy and would have the same effect on me. \n\nAs for the hacking, does he have something wrong with his throat or chest? I'm asthmatic and sometimes feel the need to do this when my asthma plays up. There might be something medical underlying it.", "Why feel guilty for telling an adult partner that his purposeful behaviour (farting on you) is not in any way attractive? If he wants to be thought of as sexy, he can't act like a toddler.

OP you\u2019re NTA. Farts can be funny at any age but at a point (like this) it\u2019s immature", "NTA.\n\nYou're exactly right, your husband needs to see a doctor and get a diagnosis.\n\nAs someone that has a family member who literally anytime they eat something unhealthy, they get acid reflux and hack away, I feel this in my soul.\n\nJust look after yourself ffs!", "NTA everyone farts but this is just grotty. My SIL always farts on my son, can't bloody well stand it and she isn't even doing to to me!", "\u201cThis time he actually listened and gave me space, he still does this at times however.\u201d Then he didn\u2019t actually listen to you if he still does it. I haven\u2019t even finished reading the post. Send him home and don\u2019t take him back until he\u2019s ready to be an adult. You have a grown child. That\u2019s disgusting! He\u2019s literally covering you in his POOP PARTICLES! That\u2019s disgusting. NTA. Maybe leave him, idk. I\u2019d lose it and never speak to him again. I know his sit down air is foul. And the hacking? No comment. I\u2019m over it. Good luck.", "NTA.\n\nHas all of this been this much of a problem the whole time you've known him? It does sound like a doctor's appointment is in order.\n\nIf he doesn't want to go to the doctor, talk to him about identifying what's causing the gas. He can write down what he's consuming for a week and what seems to be triggers (yes, a \"fart diary\".)\n\nHe needs to stop farting on you NOW. This should be non-negotiable. The deliberate \"assaults\" should be met with consequences imposed by you; I'm sure you can come up with a suitable....solution. :)", "I find this farting in the face so disgusting. If you think that with most farts (except you have clean bowels) you also wind out poop particles. \n\nYou can't say that this person respect me when they treat me like this and give a shit about all my complains. OP is a tool for his amusement. But not an equal partner. \n\nNTA", "Farting and clearing throat/burping is fine. We all do it. Restraining you against your will and being fucking disgusting about it is NOT ok.  NTA.

He has given me the silent treatment when he\u2019s mad though so I guess I\u2019ll just see.", "Legal pepper spray! \nAnd then laugh cause it's funny!", "It\u2019s not really a cough but more of a \u201cI\u2019m gonna spit\u201d kind of sound. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s going to spit a loogie. I really don\u2019t know how to describe it. It\u2019s loud but I don\u2019t think he does it on purpose.", "Anybody that enjoys physically restraining their partner against their will has a power/control issue", "farting a lot? maybe. constant dutch ovens + holding her down to fart directly in her face? that's crossing several lines for anybody, whether you find farts funny or not.", "I\u2019m the same way with my wife.  She\u2019s walked into a room where I thought I had some clear out time and I yelled \u201cno, get out!\u201d and she ran out and asked if she caught me masterbating.  I reluctantly told her why I said it and now if I tell her to stay out of a room she\u2019ll ask if I wiped up the mess.   Spark is still there after 15 years, that\u2019s for sure.", "If he puts his butt near your face to fart on you again.  Bite it as hard as you can.  I did this to an ex who did the same thing as your husband, I bit so hard I broke skin.  Sorry not sorry he never did that again.....with me at least", "Hey, at least he's giving you a break from all the farting.", "Have you ever heard of a spine?", "You should not be required to sugar coat this. He has knowingly been crossing your boundaries over and over and he either finds the joke more important than your feelings, or, worse, also enjoys upsetting you.", "I was wondering...", "My exact thoughts", "Oh thank goodness you said it!! I wondered how far I would need to scroll for your comment!!", "I use to be like this. I got allergy tested cut out a few foods and I\u2019m no longer gassy or bloated all the time. I always thought it was normal but it isn\u2019t get help!it\u2019s worth it!!", "I used to be like this. Turns out I have a sulfite intolerance. \n\nFarting that much means you're in gastrointestinal distress.

Sometimes my husband takes time to process his mistakes and usually we sit down and talk when he processes his feelings. I\u2019m sure that when he fixes the problem that things will get better but I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying we aren\u2019t compatible anymore when we haven\u2019t even gotten a chance to talk about it yet.", "It's not a farting problem. It's a ***husband*** problem. This isn't something he doesn't have control over. Him being gassy doesn't force him to hold you down so you're forced to smell it. That is a consistent, active choice he makes, against your wishes. Honestly, I'm not sure why that's not more of a problem for you. That he will physically hold you down to force you to do something you don't want to do. That's not something a doctor will fix except for maybe a therapist."]}
