Henri is non-verbal and has a host of mental, emotional and other developmental disabilities.  In short, he isn't capable of really learning anything or retaining it for longer than a day including facial recognition.\n\nI resented it so. I could not play sports, see friends, or barely study because I had to always manage Henri.  So, I was isolated, tired, lonely, and generally a very angry person.  Wiping asses will do that. I would sometimes say angry things, like how three lives (mine, my mother's and my father's) are being wasted all for one who doesn't even realize it.\n\nMy parents say they will send me to uni, but want me to sign a paper saying that when I turn 30, I will take in Henri.  I tell them no, and they say that if I won't take care of Henri, then I'm not family and must leave the day after I finish secondary school.  The last thing I said as they threw my bag on the lawn was \"You have a choice. You have a son who can have dinner with you, give you grandchildren, and have a glass of wine with you by the fire.  Henri will never do anything for you or anybody. Choose me and you can have a son. Choose Henri and you get nothing.\" They didn't choose me.\n\nSo, I was 17 and homeless. I enlisted in the army and got sent to a conflict zone.  I saw terrible horrors there and was wounded by a roadside bomb.  While recovering, I befriended some doctors who were impressed at how much of an interest I took in medicine and encouraged me to study to become a doctor through the military.  It was a long road, but I did it, then five years ago, I became a civilian doctor and eventually moved to a nearby country for a fresh start.\n\nA week ago, my parents walk into my office. They sit down and talk about how good it is to see me, how far I've come, and I feel a cold rage and I cut it short and ask why they're really here.  He says it is because there are new treatments for Henri's condition and that I could help.  Then my mother added (obvious she almost forgot) \"Plus to see you!\"\n\nI asked \"Has Henri ever done anything for you or anybody yet?\" My mother cried.  I told them I had to go through hell to build my life because I wouldn't be enslaved to Henri, and now that I have done so and paid a terrible price for it, how dare they ask me for anything. I said they're just back because they found out that there is more to leech.  But it doesn't even matter how much they leech, it is all for nothing.  If it were the King's son, all of the doctors in the country couldn't do shit.  They may as well be throwing away their lives, their time and their money worshipping a bowling ball since there is as much chance of it making a difference or mattering.  I will never be their son again, but they can at least have the rest of their lives if they surrender him.  I told them that before, but now I do so again as a physician and as a last deed to them.\n\nIt was harsh but it felt good to be able to deliver a message that I held on to for a long time.\n\nAlso, if it matters, Henri's condition it totally hopeless.  In order for him to have any improved cognitive or motor development, things would need to happen in his brain which are not just considered impossible under current medicine, but the far side of impossible.

Your childhood could have been handled so much better than what they gave you and I'm sorry for you, them, and your brother", "NTA. As a veteran myself, I am part of a PTSD study 'cause according to the experts, I should suffer from it but I don't. I figure it is due to being raised by a very abusive mother, both physically and mentally. I learned to sleep like a cat to get clear of her blows when she attacked while I slept. The hate I carry for that woman colors every part of my world, including my time in Kuwait, Somalia, Croatia, and Afghanistan. That hate was my armor, my shield from feeling anything. At least mine was concentrated on one person instead of 3. And I can channel it.\n\nYour PTSD started before you saw service. It is the foundation of everything that has happened since. As long as your therapy never addresses it, your old PTSD isn't being dealt with. It has to be dealt with as a whole, not just piecemeal. To a therapist, the old stuff may appear to be mickey mouse but is more like the tip of an iceberg.\n\nVeteran services have a tendency to only understand what they expect to see. I served 33+ yrs and the doctors were great with young person problems, sprains and broken limbs but arthritis? Cardiac issues? The life expectancy for guys like me is about 5 yrs after retirement due to diseases that should have been spotted while we still served. By the time a civvy doctor spots it, the die is cast.\n\nI highly recommend getting a young therapist or a civilian one that still has an open mind to all possibilities rather than the closed mind of a long-in-the-tooth veteran specialist.

Of course you were/are resentful when your parents and other professionals around the child (and if your in the uk you 100% should have had a team of professionals working with your parents including OT and PT through the NHS, I have no clue what would be available in other countries). You should not have had uni held over your head. You should have been able to grow as a person outside of Henri and I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t given that childhood where you could have done your thing, then come home excited to tell henri all about it. \n\nBut the way you talk about Henri shows a lot of misplaced anger, he didn\u2019t force any of that on you. Your parents did, and Henri is still a person deserving of respect and kindness", "ESH. Henri is innocent and the amount of hatred and resentment you feel towards him is unjust. You seem to be harboring a ton of anger and misplacing it on your brother.

Your parents are definitely a-holes and you have every right to be furious with them.", "YTA for the (admittedly understandable) resentment of Henri. The bowling ball comparison in particular. You have a lot of anger towards him that should be directed at your parents. \n\nNTA for what you said to your parents otherwise about not wanting to be chained to him and your resentment for them. This seems to be a pretty common error where one kid has a problem, so it leads to the family entirely revolving around him and it completely messes with the lives of the other kids.  \n\nThis seems to be a common mistake parents make.

He has contributed nothing to the world except pain and anguish. He has ruined three lives. I know it isn't his fault and I know it isn't fair, but imagine that there was a thing out there and because it existed, you had experienced uncountable horrors in your life, never had a friend until you were 18 and saw them die at 20.

With the sick irony that he never knew, much less cared how much was heaped at his feet, and none of it will ever make a damn bit of difference.  It was all for nothing.\n\nWas it only because of Henri? No. It was also my parents' choices, choices of certain geopolitical actors, choices of my country to get involved in a foreign war, and choices of war criminals that led to me going through what I had.

My friends mom was amazing, as she got older the sister did go to a group home. She has learned to walk and go to the bathroom.  Your parents had a lot of nerve.

I saw a comment you made saying how can he even be a brother if he didn't contribute anything to you? It isn't like he CHOSE not to be a 'real' brother. He literally can't be one. He physically and mentally cannot. However, I'm sure all of that stems from the trauma of him being your responsibility for your entire childhood. And that your parents picked him instead of you, after all you did for THEM by being his caretaker for so long. In reality, all of that pain you feel really has nothing to do with your brother. He didn't do that to you. He didn't cause that trauma by being alive. Your shitty parents caused it by depriving you of your youth because they didn't want to deal with him, and made him your responsibility instead. And used him as a pawn to get what they wanted. So for the way you refer to him...soft Y T A. \n\nBut i digress. I guess your main question was if you were right to cut your parents out. For that, NTA.

They tried to take care of her at home, but when she was 3 she was taken to live in a care home nearby because her parents saw the toll it was taking on the rest of the family.

Just because it\u2019s harsh doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true \n\nTo have had to sacrifice so much of your life and to see your parents\u2019 sacrifice must feel especially senseless in light of what you saw in battle. This is a completely understandable frustration and I think it\u2019s worth having to accept people (the ignorant ones who accuse you of being callus or ableist) will never understand that and aren\u2019t worth having a back and forth with", "Ah, I see. Well, that's understandable. Though, your parents are certainly going to have to get used to the idea of a state hospital, because they aren't going to be able to take care of him forever, and definitely don't deserve to rely on you. \n\nI'm very familiar with your friends saying, my dad used to say it all the time haha. That, along with \"people in hell want ice water\" in response to me saying I want something. American sayings are strange.", "I also feel that people who haven't experienced a deep level trauma will never understand. They will always try to say \"but family\" as if that is an excuse to brush aside the trauma you have experienced directly and indirectly by them.\n\nPeople may view you as harsh because you are in a better place financially and can pay for treatments. You owe them nothing. You are doing more of a service to humanity by doing what you are doing.\n\nProtecting yourself is absolutely the priority. I hope you've had them banned from your workplace.", "Well, to be fair, Henri per se isn't actually the reason he joined the military - his parents' actions are. Henri being born wasn't the issue; his parents choosing to force op into a caretaker role was.", "Rich for somebody to force OP to have empathy when you yourself couldn't understand where OP is coming from \ud83d\ude44", "having empathy for patients has nothing to do with having empathy towards a source of trauma. \n\nhenri didn\u2019t intentionally ruin OPs life, but his existence causes OP so much suffering and trauma that i really cant blame him for his hatred. being forced to have your whole life revolve around a person you didnt choose to have, to the point that your safety and future relies on you signing away your adult life to look after them? that builds nothing but resentment, and i dont blame OP for that, nor do i blame henri. but OP has had such a shitty life, which is the way it is because of henri\u2019s existence, and i think its completely valid to have some level of resentment even if it does need to he worked on\n\nits an awful situation, and OP definitely needs to work through this with a therapist, but when you have a lost pet (trauma with henri) and a raging house fire (PTSD from war), you have to put out the fire before you deal with the pet. \n\nand we need to recognise that OP may never get to a point where that resentment goes away. he lost his entire childhood (henri was born when OP was 5), his home, and his parents, all because of henri, even if it isnt henri\u2019s fault. and im betting that his parents showing up after so many years and saying \u201cyou need to help henri\u201d just reignited all of that built up resentment. he never got an apology, he never got any acknowledgment, just back to the same old shit.", "Nowhere did I say Henri isn't worthy of love and compassion - but I agree with OP that him making major effort to expend those things would be wasted on Henri, someone with zero capacity to understand/feel them. It would actually likely upset Henri more rather than having the effect you seem to think would happen; easing his suffering somehow. I'm autistic and people talk to me about their feelings all the time, some are things that I could never comprehend in a million years. I wish they wouldn't, because number one I don't care, genuinely, and number 2, them telling me how they are basing major life decisions on what they \"feel\" instead of what they know, makes me respect them less. The very things people use to try to \"connect\" with me actually upset me and make me feel they are unstable and I'm not safe around them. You apparently did not read all the way through to where OP states that in his country they have some sort of mandated euthanasia for those afflicted such as Henri, and by OP being in the medical community that may be something he'd be forced into for his brother....is that your desired outcome in the name of \"kindness\"?", "You are severely lacking in empathy if you have read this post and have come to the conclusion that OP is ableist.", "Is it ableist if you think he would be better aborted or euthanized? Looks like the parents wanted the \"great parents\" pin from someone who has a disabled child... Without even caring for the child... How can someone who's live has been forcefully taking care of a disabled since a kid, be the asshole? He is the victim, it's not ok to say such things to his brother, but saying then didn't make him an apple, just a traumatized guy...", "If God forbid something happened to my son, we would have to be very fair and realistic about what sacrifices make sense and don't make sense.  For example, I would not make my daughter into a child caretaker, nor expect her and her eventual family to give up her future as his eternal nurse. \n\nWhat that looks like?  I don't know. However I do have experience with difficult, realistic medical decisions from my time as an army doctor. We are taught that we're not just treating one patient. We're treating an overall army. You cannot use all the resources for one case (especially a long shot case) and leave no resources for everyone else.  When it make sense to stop treatment or accept what is the realistic future and what isn't.  \n\nWhat will I do if I am in that situation?  All I can say is the best I can.  But for my family as a whole.", "Sadly, discrimination is actually really common in the medical field! When people with intellectual disabilies go to the ER they are often treated horribly and receive substandard care. It's scary to think that if you suddenly lost your ability to speak and care for yourself that others may no longer view you as a person.", "A veteran and a doctor being ableist? Fucking lol.\n\nEver heard of triage? Probably not,idealists and terminally online people dont know much about the real world.\n\nHenri is obviously innocent,he was wronged by genetics,fate,whatever you wanna believe in. In any case,forfeiting your own life to care for someone in his condition in never the right answer.\n\nAnd being forced to do so by the people you trust most? Yeah that brings out the worst in people I agree,wiping asses all your teenage years does that to you.\n\nInjustice creates frustration. Letting go of that frustration is hard.", "No but relationships do need to be.... relational.", "And yet, you are still here raging not about the horrors of war, but about your brother and parents. So we can only take that in the way it's presented and see that that is what is actually weighing on you more. You might need to try out other therapists that can see that as well.\n\nNTA", "Where the hell did you get mandated euthanasia from? He said it's an option, not that it's required.", "It is possible to have empathy for more than one group at once.\n\nOne can have empathy for OP- who barely had a childhood and whose parents were neglectful at best and actively abusive at worst- and also have empathy for a disabled person who has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to be hated for existing.", "I think everyone needs to take a step back and dial down their emotions.\n\nHenri for Op was chosen by his parents and he had to serve him for 18 years and was thrown out for not signing away his life @17- for Henri.\n\nHe will never have a relationship with Henri as they both are and tragically- nothing will ever matter to Henri. \n\nRather than throw out A H and lacking empathy for Henri, maybe seek understanding for this tragic family?", "> It's scary to think that if you suddenly lost your ability to speak and care for yourself that others may no longer view you as a person.\n\nI don't think you've read the OP or any of OP's other posts. If the brother has the condition I think he has, Henri literally can't even experience emotions, express anything like happiness or joy, or even really THINK beyond basic motor functions. If I was told I was going to suffer a brain injury that would do that to me, I'd rather be literally tossed into a garbage can to die than live like a human house plant.", "I totally agree. All I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s easy to say that as someone who didn\u2019t have to sacrifice their childhood and subsequently go to a warzone to say \u201cbe nice to Henri, it isn\u2019t his fault\u201d but for the person who lived through that it\u2019s totally understandable that they may harbour some resentment. Even to an innocent party.\n\nDoes it make it right? No, but I get it. It\u2019s a shitty situation that the parents truly fucked up.", "There isn\u2019t much to add except I am sorry you had to go through all that trauma. And I know the war trauma trumps your childhood trauma, but I am just sorry you had to endure so much at such a young age. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to defend your parents, but I also feel bad for them as well. They had an impossible (in their minds at least) choice to make and no matter what, they were going to suffer. And unfortunately, you paid the price for their choice.\n\nI am glad you are able to impart that gratefulness of life and normalcy to your son - he must be one lucky dood to have a father like you, to let him know how special he is each and every day.", "Like ypu are making henri out to be this reason for all that is bad. Its like beinbg mad at a flower. Its ALL on your parents but ypu want them to love ypu soo much that you focus all the energy towards henri.", "Henri didn't ruin three lives, your parents did.\n\nIt is their choices all along that traumatized you.", "Oh, I absolutely agree. His parents fucked up to a hideous degree. It's completely understandable why OP feels the way he does- but that doesn't make it right, y'know? \n\nI think that the things OP has said in this thread are especially concerning for someone who works in medicine and has direct contact with sick and disabled people. If that wasn't the case, I think I'd agree that it's a scenario where OP's thoughts about his brother aren't all that relevant. As it stands, though, I think it's right for people to call out some of the things OP says as being pretty heavily ableist in nature. Disabled people are still people, and ableism in the medical field is still a huge problem.\n\nI absolutely agree that it's a shitty situation. Sorry if my initial response came off as hostile.", "So their disability precludes them from requiring surgery for anything ever?", "Thank you.  I know how it is to grow up without parents. I didn't have parents. I had taskmasters. It will never happen again on my watch and my parents will never be in the same room with my children.", "As a doctor this OP is only fit for army not for civilians. He lacks empathy in a great deal! I felt sad for him reading how he had to go through everything but at the same time he seriously lacks basic empathy for disabled people. His parent made him this way but he chose not to get out of that hatred for a person who doesn\u2019t know what is happening! He said he is a surgeon. What if someone hits his car on the way to work and he put his anger on the operating table to an innocent patient? He first needs to learn that one person\u2019s anger should not be focused on another!"]}
