Henri is non-verbal and has a host of mental, emotional and other developmental disabilities.  In short, he isn't capable of really learning anything or retaining it for longer than a day including facial recognition.\n\nI resented it so. I could not play sports, see friends, or barely study because I had to always manage Henri.  So, I was isolated, tired, lonely, and generally a very angry person.  Wiping asses will do that. I would sometimes say angry things, like how three lives (mine, my mother's and my father's) are being wasted all for one who doesn't even realize it.\n\nMy parents say they will send me to uni, but want me to sign a paper saying that when I turn 30, I will take in Henri.  I tell them no, and they say that if I won't take care of Henri, then I'm not family and must leave the day after I finish secondary school.  The last thing I said as they threw my bag on the lawn was \"You have a choice. You have a son who can have dinner with you, give you grandchildren, and have a glass of wine with you by the fire.  Henri will never do anything for you or anybody. Choose me and you can have a son. Choose Henri and you get nothing.\" They didn't choose me.\n\nSo, I was 17 and homeless. I enlisted in the army and got sent to a conflict zone.  I saw terrible horrors there and was wounded by a roadside bomb.  While recovering, I befriended some doctors who were impressed at how much of an interest I took in medicine and encouraged me to study to become a doctor through the military.  It was a long road, but I did it, then five years ago, I became a civilian doctor and eventually moved to a nearby country for a fresh start.\n\nA week ago, my parents walk into my office. They sit down and talk about how good it is to see me, how far I've come, and I feel a cold rage and I cut it short and ask why they're really here.  He says it is because there are new treatments for Henri's condition and that I could help.  Then my mother added (obvious she almost forgot) \"Plus to see you!\"\n\nI asked \"Has Henri ever done anything for you or anybody yet?\" My mother cried.  I told them I had to go through hell to build my life because I wouldn't be enslaved to Henri, and now that I have done so and paid a terrible price for it, how dare they ask me for anything. I said they're just back because they found out that there is more to leech.  But it doesn't even matter how much they leech, it is all for nothing.  If it were the King's son, all of the doctors in the country couldn't do shit.  They may as well be throwing away their lives, their time and their money worshipping a bowling ball since there is as much chance of it making a difference or mattering.  I will never be their son again, but they can at least have the rest of their lives if they surrender him.  I told them that before, but now I do so again as a physician and as a last deed to them.\n\nIt was harsh but it felt good to be able to deliver a message that I held on to for a long time.\n\nAlso, if it matters, Henri's condition it totally hopeless.  In order for him to have any improved cognitive or motor development, things would need to happen in his brain which are not just considered impossible under current medicine, but the far side of impossible.

Your childhood could have been handled so much better than what they gave you and I'm sorry for you, them, and your brother", "NTA. As a veteran myself, I am part of a PTSD study 'cause according to the experts, I should suffer from it but I don't. I figure it is due to being raised by a very abusive mother, both physically and mentally. I learned to sleep like a cat to get clear of her blows when she attacked while I slept. The hate I carry for that woman colors every part of my world, including my time in Kuwait, Somalia, Croatia, and Afghanistan. That hate was my armor, my shield from feeling anything. At least mine was concentrated on one person instead of 3. And I can channel it.\n\nYour PTSD started before you saw service. It is the foundation of everything that has happened since. As long as your therapy never addresses it, your old PTSD isn't being dealt with. It has to be dealt with as a whole, not just piecemeal. To a therapist, the old stuff may appear to be mickey mouse but is more like the tip of an iceberg.\n\nVeteran services have a tendency to only understand what they expect to see. I served 33+ yrs and the doctors were great with young person problems, sprains and broken limbs but arthritis? Cardiac issues? The life expectancy for guys like me is about 5 yrs after retirement due to diseases that should have been spotted while we still served. By the time a civvy doctor spots it, the die is cast.\n\nI highly recommend getting a young therapist or a civilian one that still has an open mind to all possibilities rather than the closed mind of a long-in-the-tooth veteran specialist.

You should not have had uni held over your head. You should have been able to grow as a person outside of Henri and I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t given that childhood where you could have done your thing, then come home excited to tell henri all about it. \n\nBut the way you talk about Henri shows a lot of misplaced anger, he didn\u2019t force any of that on you. Your parents did, and Henri is still a person deserving of respect and kindness", "ESH. Henri is innocent and the amount of hatred and resentment you feel towards him is unjust. You seem to be harboring a ton of anger and misplacing it on your brother.

Your parents are definitely a-holes and you have every right to be furious with them.", "YTA for the (admittedly understandable) resentment of Henri. The bowling ball comparison in particular. You have a lot of anger towards him that should be directed at your parents. \n\nNTA for what you said to your parents otherwise about not wanting to be chained to him and your resentment for them. This seems to be a pretty common error where one kid has a problem, so it leads to the family entirely revolving around him and it completely messes with the lives of the other kids.  \n\nThis seems to be a common mistake parents make.

He has contributed nothing to the world except pain and anguish. He has ruined three lives. I know it isn't his fault and I know it isn't fair, but imagine that there was a thing out there and because it existed, you had experienced uncountable horrors in your life, never had a friend until you were 18 and saw them die at 20.

With the sick irony that he never knew, much less cared how much was heaped at his feet, and none of it will ever make a damn bit of difference.  It was all for nothing.\n\nWas it only because of Henri? No. It was also my parents' choices, choices of certain geopolitical actors, choices of my country to get involved in a foreign war, and choices of war criminals that led to me going through what I had.

My friends mom was amazing, as she got older the sister did go to a group home. She has learned to walk and go to the bathroom.  Your parents had a lot of nerve.

I saw a comment you made saying how can he even be a brother if he didn't contribute anything to you? It isn't like he CHOSE not to be a 'real' brother. He literally can't be one. He physically and mentally cannot. However, I'm sure all of that stems from the trauma of him being your responsibility for your entire childhood. And that your parents picked him instead of you, after all you did for THEM by being his caretaker for so long. In reality, all of that pain you feel really has nothing to do with your brother. He didn't do that to you. He didn't cause that trauma by being alive. Your shitty parents caused it by depriving you of your youth because they didn't want to deal with him, and made him your responsibility instead. And used him as a pawn to get what they wanted. So for the way you refer to him...soft Y T A. \n\nBut i digress. I guess your main question was if you were right to cut your parents out. For that, NTA.

They tried to take care of her at home, but when she was 3 she was taken to live in a care home nearby because her parents saw the toll it was taking on the rest of the family.

Went into therapy for that.  At the start, genuinely believed that the comparitively lesser traumas of childhood bullying, a few isolated sexual assaults, parentification, having a narcissist parent and undiagnosed autism were a far lower priority than dealing with the anxious and reactive state my ex had left me in.  After some initial more traditional therapies, did a year of EMDR focused almost entirely on my ex.  Left it feeling healed and well.\n\nI was back 6 months later when I started having a way worse breakdown because I was processing everything else.  Turned out that all those childhood experiences primed me to react to my later trauma in the ways that I did, so I couldn't actually heal past any of it until I'd unpacked all of it and drawn the threads between events.  Cue another year of EMDR.\n\nYou are NTA for throwing your parents out.  Your brother should never have been made your burden nor your obligation - he was their choice and their charge.

Hell, looking at the way you write here, your parents' choices stole not only your childhood but your youth as you were left with little choice but to take on a traumatic military experience, and also stole any chance you had of developing feelings of love towards your brother who, ultimately, had no say in any of this.\n\nHowever, you would be TA to yourself if you don't allow yourself to get therapy for the \"Mickey Mouse bullshit\" as much as everything else you faced.", "I hear you too.

I used to watch him, bathe him, feed him, and even do some ABA and IBI exercises with him. \n\nBut I\u2019m so glad they pushed him and made him so independent, because it\u2019s wonderful seeing him enjoy life.
