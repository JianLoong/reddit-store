In short, he isn't capable of really learning anything or retaining it for longer than a day including facial recognition.\n\nI resented it so. I could not play sports, see friends, or barely study because I had to always manage Henri.  So, I was isolated, tired, lonely, and generally a very angry person.  Wiping asses will do that. I would sometimes say angry things, like how three lives (mine, my mother's and my father's) are being wasted all for one who doesn't even realize it.\n\nMy parents say they will send me to uni, but want me to sign a paper saying that when I turn 30, I will take in Henri.  I tell them no, and they say that if I won't take care of Henri, then I'm not family and must leave the day after I finish secondary school.  The last thing I said as they threw my bag on the lawn was \"You have a choice. You have a son who can have dinner with you, give you grandchildren, and have a glass of wine with you by the fire.  Henri will never do anything for you or anybody. Choose me and you can have a son. Choose Henri and you get nothing.\" They didn't choose me.\n\nSo, I was 17 and homeless. I enlisted in the army and got sent to a conflict zone.  I saw terrible horrors there and was wounded by a roadside bomb.  While recovering, I befriended some doctors who were impressed at how much of an interest I took in medicine and encouraged me to study to become a doctor through the military.  It was a long road, but I did it, then five years ago, I became a civilian doctor.\n\nA week ago, my parents walk into my office. They sit down and talk about how good it is to see me, how far I've come, and I feel a cold rage and I cut it short and ask why they're really here.  He says it is because there are new treatments for Henri's condition and that I could help.  Then my mother added (obvious she almost forgot) \"Plus to see you!\"\n\nI asked \"Has Henri ever done anything for you or anybody yet?\" My mother cried.  I told them I had to go through hell to build my life because I wouldn't be enslaved to Henri, and now that I have done so and paid a terrible price for it, how dare they ask me for anything. I said they're just back because they found out that there is more to leech.  But it doesn't even matter how much they leech, it is all for nothing.  If it were the King's son, all of the doctors in the country couldn't do shit.  They may as well be throwing away their lives, their time and their money worshipping a bowling ball since there is as much chance of it making a difference or mattering.  I will never be their son again, but they can at least have the rest of their lives if they surrender him.  I told them that before, but now I do so again as a physician and as a last deed to them.\n\nIt was harsh but it felt good to be able to deliver a message that I held on to for a long time.\n\nAlso, if it matters, Henri's condition it totally hopeless.  In order for him to have any improved cognitive or motor development, things would need to happen in his brain which are not just considered impossible under current medicine, but the far side of impossible.

Your childhood could have been handled so much better than what they gave you and I'm sorry for you, them, and your brother", "NTA. As a veteran myself, I am part of a PTSD study 'cause according to the experts, I should suffer from it but I don't. I figure it is due to being raised by a very abusive mother, both physically and mentally. I learned to sleep like a cat to get clear of her blows when she attacked while I slept. The hate I carry for that woman colors every part of my world, including my time in Kuwait, Somalia, Croatia, and Afghanistan. That hate was my armor, my shield from feeling anything. At least mine was concentrated on one person instead of 3. And I can channel it.\n\nYour PTSD started before you saw service. It is the foundation of everything that has happened since. As long as your therapy never addresses it, your old PTSD isn't being dealt with. It has to be dealt with as a whole, not just piecemeal. To a therapist, the old stuff may appear to be mickey mouse but is more like the tip of an iceberg.\n\nVeteran services have a tendency to only understand what they expect to see. I served 33+ yrs and the doctors were great with young person problems, sprains and broken limbs but arthritis? Cardiac issues? The life expectancy for guys like me is about 5 yrs after retirement due to diseases that should have been spotted while we still served. By the time a civvy doctor spots it, the die is cast.\n\nI highly recommend getting a young therapist or a civilian one that still has an open mind to all possibilities rather than the closed mind of a long-in-the-tooth veteran specialist.

You should have been able to grow as a person outside of Henri and I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t given that childhood where you could have done your thing, then come home excited to tell henri all about it. \n\nBut the way you talk about Henri shows a lot of misplaced anger, he didn\u2019t force any of that on you. Your parents did, and Henri is still a person deserving of respect and kindness", "ESH. Henri is innocent and the amount of hatred and resentment you feel towards him is unjust. You seem to be harboring a ton of anger and misplacing it on your brother.

Your parents are definitely a-holes and you have every right to be furious with them.", "YTA for the (admittedly understandable) resentment of Henri. The bowling ball comparison in particular. You have a lot of anger towards him that should be directed at your parents. \n\nNTA for what you said to your parents otherwise about not wanting to be chained to him and your resentment for them. This seems to be a pretty common error where one kid has a problem, so it leads to the family entirely revolving around him and it completely messes with the lives of the other kids.  \n\nThis seems to be a common mistake parents make.

He has contributed nothing to the world except pain and anguish. He has ruined three lives. I know it isn't his fault and I know it isn't fair, but imagine that there was a thing out there and because it existed, you had experienced uncountable horrors in your life, never had a friend until you were 18 and saw them die at 20.

No. It was also my parents' choices, choices of certain geopolitical actors, choices of my country to get involved in a foreign war, and choices of war criminals that led to me going through what I had.

He physically and mentally cannot. However, I'm sure all of that stems from the trauma of him being your responsibility for your entire childhood. And that your parents picked him instead of you, after all you did for THEM by being his caretaker for so long. In reality, all of that pain you feel really has nothing to do with your brother. He didn't do that to you. He didn't cause that trauma by being alive. Your shitty parents caused it by depriving you of your youth because they didn't want to deal with him, and made him your responsibility instead. And used him as a pawn to get what they wanted. So for the way you refer to him...soft Y T A. \n\nBut i digress. I guess your main question was if you were right to cut your parents out. For that, NTA.

You should have never been required to look after your brother and your parents are total assholes for that but he is a living breathing human being (who has ZERO fault in this) and you talk about him with a level of disgust that is frightening. They should have had a better relationship with both sons but referring to your brother as a drain, a bowling ball etc is disgusting. Get help for your own well being and to be a better doctor!", "NTA", "Ur parents are TA! Keep moving forward and don\u2019t look back. Best of luck!", "NTA, they chose to come to you to try and steal more of your life then they already had and you responded as anyone would when faced with such.  Frankly it was kind of you to not tell them to leave immediately and at least give them the time to say their piece.  Because honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered with asking why they came.", "NTA", "ESH. Your parents made this monster by traumatizing you through forcing you to parent your brother in your youth and attempting to make him your responsibility when they would clearly still be able to care for him (as they have for the past 5 years). But they way you speak about him is truly appalling. As a medical professional, you would be wise to seek counseling to deal with your resentment toward the profoundly disabled.", "Henri's condition doesn't allow him to even recognize kindness and respect, so this is a moot point", "I'm actually not worried about them naming me guardian in the will because my country allows euthanasia.  \n\nI would not do that for a variety of reasons, including that I'd consider myself extremely conflicted as an ethical matter. However, my parents don't know that and probably think I absolutely would.", "You know what? Its all the truth. Everyone is so wrapped up \"ohh how can you say that! that's so mean!\" So everyone pretends its not true. \n\nMy parents threw away their lives for appearances and nobody is too busy wringing their hands to stand up and say it. Fuck that. I'll say it all and stand behind it because I've paid the price of everyone being too precious to say the truth. \n\nIt the goddamn truth.  All of it.", ">I think the reason you don't want to discuss Henry with your therapist is because the wound is deeper then you can admit to yourself.\n\nNo. It is because when I close my eyes, I see eyeless children face down in a burned down village.  Sorry to be blunt about it, but when I say bigger fish to fry, I'm not kidding and people seem to not believe me.", "Actually I am a parent.  I have a wonderful son who just turned six and my wife is due with a daughter in another month.  I will make sure to treat them and my wife all as the most important people in the world, and most importantly, as their own people with their own lives and the right to their own paths.", "100%\n\nLikely categorically worse than caring for your brother.\n\nHowever, the fact you were a child does shift the scales and significance.\nPeople come out of the same situations with different impacts.  But there can be significant trauma feeling like your parents didn't care about you. And being shown you weren't a priority.\n\nSo calling that mickey mouse is a disservice to that trauma, which deserves some weight. Or you wouldn't have had any reaction to seeing the people who birthed you. Not to say your reaction is wasn't warranted. You were more mature than I could even dream of being.", "I've been told by some of my buds that yoga helps immensely. Sigh... my wife will love it if I give it a shot. She is an instructor. \n\nI've got medical issues associated with age and hard living, eating and sleeping poorly for 30+ yrs. I am still in better shape, mentally and physically, than most in their late 50s.\n\nI escaped from the war zones without collecting souvenirs, without losing any blood at all. And the wounds that should be there mentally, emotionally don't exist for me. My mother made me immune, about the only thing I could thank her for. She still lives, doesn't remember anything and has mild dementia, leaving me with no resolution.\n\nMaybe tossing your folks out at least gave you something that you can use to put out the flames. At some point, if you can see past the hate, you start to pity these people that are leading such hopeless lives. They will never have anything, will die alone, struggling. They made their choice a long time ago and can't conceive of anything else. \n\nI can see my mother as a mean spirited, narcissist who made herself feel better by destroying others. I was the oldest of 6 so she vented all of her frustrations on me. All of our neighbors avoided her. Who needs a school bully when you live with someone far worse? So joining up was an easy choice, almost relaxing.\n\nI admire your perseverance, your ability to find something to put your intellect to, saving others. I wish you well on your journey and hope those inner demons fade with time.  \n\nI've often wondered if I dealt with my one demon, would the others crawl out of the woodwork? At this point, I expect I'll carry it to the grave, my own unseen wounds that never quite heal.", "Henri is the reason you joined the military, the reason that you experienced extreme trauma. It's clear that you still hold anger at the situation.   \n\nI, like everyone else, would suggest that you also look at this familial trauma before you perpetuate and unhealthy issues into your current family dynamic.", "I'm sorry that your life has led you to believe that kindness and compassion are things you have to earn and be worthy of. The fact he can't \"recognize\" kindness doesn't make him unworthy of it. He's a human being. He's suffering. I don't know how you can be a doctor and not have compassion for someone like him.\n\nI'm not saying your parents are in anyway right. That's horrible what they did to you and you owe them absolutely nothing. What worries me is that you've let what they've done to you turn you into someone willing to transfer all that anger and hatred onto someone who is completely innocent.", "Sooo only people that can do things for you have value? He has a disability, it\u2019s not his fault. You\u2019re taking out your anger at your parents on an innocent party and sound ableist as hell. YTA", "A supposed veteran and doctor espousing such ableist shit is so incredibly disappointing.", "You don\u2019t belong in the medical profession given your obvious lack of ethics. Luckily, this is either fake or your attitude will have you in front of a disciplinary board shortly anyway. I hope it happens sooner than later.", "I think people have a harder time believing you have other issues that require your focus more because you've experienced extremely traumatic things beyond the wildest imagination of the average person.\n\nI, myself, can't even begin to pretend to understand what you have experienced.\n\nHowever, I understand many people minimizing my emotions because they didn't believe me.\n\nWhatever you're doing works for you and honestly I am in awe with the amount of emotional strength you have had to muster to make it this far in your life.\n\nYou're doing what's best for you and you should focus on that, instead of random strangers on the internet that your family issues should be addressed more than your military trauma.\n\nIt's not fair that people are telling you that you're ablist and underserving of being a doctor because you were dealt an unloving family and a sibling who can never understand the world around him.\n\nDoctors are people too and they're allowed to feel the way they feel. People aren't understanding that about your post. Any doctor can have a rough past with familial resentment, that doesn't make them bad doctors.\n\nResenting your own disabled sibling also doesn't mean you are ablist either. \n\nYou worked harder by your 30s than a lot of people ever could their entire lives to achieve everything you have and honestly that is amazing. \n\nI wish you all of the peace you deserve in your life.", "As long as one isn't disabled right. Then they don't deserve a thing.", ">Maybe tossing your folks out at least gave you something that you can use to put out the flames. \n\nIt was kind of nice, actually.  Rang a little hollow since it is nothing compared to what they put me through, but a crumb is better than nothing.  \n\nAlso, sounds like you're doing pretty well if you married a yoga teacher. I've never seen one that was bad to look at.  So, even if the yoga doesn't help quiet some of the things going on or feel good on your body, it sounds like it would be a great bonding experience with your wife.  You're going to get a lot of out of it, friend.\n\nI suspect that if I manage to beat back one demon, the next in line will step forward.  But if it is one less, and weaker than the bigger ones I chased off, I'll take it.  \n\nOne thing my psychiatrist has given me some very good advice on is that I'll never get anywhere just full time trying to fight off the past. It happened and isn't going anywhere.  If all my mental energy is tied up there, I may as well never have left the middle east. I have to put my focus in the present, which is a good place and the future which can be better yet.  I need to start turning the page.\n\nMy old commanding officer had it especially hard.  Saw a lot of losses and was doing investigations for the UN on war crimes against civilians.  He had it far worse than me and got out around the time I did.  However, he's happy, smiling laughing and I ask him how he deals with it.  He says \"Jacques, after what we did, all we've seen, my worst day here is better than my best day there.  After that, I haven't had day since coming home and probably never will.\"\n\nI'm trying to take that in and although I can't say I'm there, it helps.", "I love and care for my biological brother because I've spent time with him growing up and interacting positively. I resent my brother because of all the times he's been a little shit. none of that has anything to do with the fact I'm genetically related to him.\n\nOP has never had a brotherly relationship with Henri. that doesn't mean it's okay to blame Henri for the hardships OP had to endure (and he's already admitted in other comments that he agrees that makes him an AH), but it's perfectly reasonable to say he doesn't really have a brother.", "Based on OPs descriptions in the comments his brother is 1 step above a medically vegetative state. Someone that can't ever recognize or even know you isn't really a sibling.", "Reality is still reality.", "I have a spotless record with my patients.  Henri is not my patient.  I can have as much personal animus against him as I want and the boards have nothing to do with that.  Or do you think completely personal grudges are cause for professional discipline??\n\nSo thank you for your completely uninformed spitballing.", "They won't deserve to swallow three other lives.", "I understand that, now you've been through much worse things, the things you endured in your childhood look irrelevant in comparison.\n\nBut the version of you who went through those things as a child - the child you - hadn't yet experienced those worse things. The damage caused by trauma isn't lessened by worse trauma later in life. It's something you should try to address at some point.", "I admit that when stuff is hitting the fan, I always have that voice in my head that says \"you've seen worse\" or \"you've hurt more and survived\" or \"at least their not shooting at you\". That hate from way back is almost your titanium spine. I embraced it long ago and probably will never let it go. It is a large part of who I am and how I got here. Your old CO is bang on.\n\nMy men suffered from PTSD a lot. Hugs were given and tears have been shed many times. While I carry that demon, I can still empathize with my military family, my NCOs and officers alike. We will always have the memories that bind.\n\nMy friend, laugh at life and enjoy the ride til the end. Us old soldiers can just watch through our jaded eyes as the young do their damnedest to make their way in this new world that seems to be leaving us behind. I don't envy the next generations but my fight is done. Now I'll just glide to the finish, bilking the public purse of my pension for as long as I can. :)\n\nAs us aviators used to say, may your skies be clear and a million. And cumulo-granite sucks. :)", "So?", "So if you were required to treat a patient with the same condition as Henri, you would be completely impartial and provide the highest quality of care possible to them?", "Well until you're the parent if the disabled you don't know do you? You can assume all you want but you're completely unnecessary. You have no idea how TF your parents feel.", "And the original trauma can fracture yourself so the later trauma hits harder.", "Thank you my friend.  As as we say Honneur et Fidelite. Thank you again.", "No, because I am not a neurologist.  I am a surgeon. So I would decline to treat them.", "Actually having lived in that situation and as a physician, I do know.  Surrender them to the state.  Three lives cannot be sacrificed for one.  Especially if it is a hopeless case.", "No you don't know what it's like to be the parent of a disabled child. You know what it's like to be the bitter brother. Huge difference. You being a physician doesn't mean shit here.", "In many places it's not as easy to just surrender them to the state as it used to be...I have multiple friends who are begging for help to take care of children who actually endanger their siblings and in the United States there is simply not the facilities for it. Its not even about quality of care it's that there is simple lack of facilities... But have you thought what you would do if your perfectly delightful child or wonderful wife was horribly injured in an accident? Would you really go... Oh well, no hope time to get a new one, they are too hard to take care of, can't be bothered.?", "It is wrong to sacrifice three lives for one. Throw all the bullshit and what-ifs at it as you want, but that is inescapable. Like hell I'd allow that again.", "Until you're the parent you don't truly know do you. I'd watch myself though cause karma is a bitch. Stay blessed.", "So you're just gonna ignore how OP was parentified as a child and knows full well what it's like to have to take care of a child with severe disabilities and had his hildhood stolen from him then made homeless by his own parents at 17 years old? Everything you said is absolute bullshit."]}
