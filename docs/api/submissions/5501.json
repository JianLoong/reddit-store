But you probably need more help than Reddit or the internet can provide you...", "NTA\n\nScrew your parents for what they did to you. Looking after your brother was not your responsibility and they clearly only want you back in their lives for what you can do for them.\n\nAlso as others have said your anger towards him isn't healthy. It's not his fault.", "NTA\n\nYour sentiments towards your brother are justified. Your parents were and still are in the wrong. I hope removing them from your office (and I assume your life) provided you with some much needed closure. I see you\u2019re in therapy and it appears to be paying off. Thank you for your service, and good luck to you!", "NTA man, they threw you out into the world as a literal child, because your refused to take care of something they made.\n\nYou. Owe. Them. Nothing.\n\nYou\u2019re not turning your back on them, you\u2019ve been walking the road youre on for almost 20 years, and they weren\u2019t there to see any of it.", "NTA but your parents sound like real pieces of work trying to force you into being a care giver to your brother obviously he didn\u2019t have a choice so I hope all anger is pointed at parents", "NTA, they almost ruined your entire life. Their child is not, and absolutely never should have been, your responsibility. You said it best when you told them they will get nothing. Your childhood could have been handled so much better than what they gave you and I'm sorry for you, them, and your brother", "NTA. As a veteran myself, I am part of a PTSD study 'cause according to the experts, I should suffer from it but I don't. I figure it is due to being raised by a very abusive mother, both physically and mentally. I learned to sleep like a cat to get clear of her blows when she attacked while I slept. The hate I carry for that woman colors every part of my world, including my time in Kuwait, Somalia, Croatia, and Afghanistan. That hate was my armor, my shield from feeling anything. At least mine was concentrated on one person instead of 3. And I can channel it.\n\nYour PTSD started before you saw service. It is the foundation of everything that has happened since. As long as your therapy never addresses it, your old PTSD isn't being dealt with. It has to be dealt with as a whole, not just piecemeal. To a therapist, the old stuff may appear to be mickey mouse but is more like the tip of an iceberg.\n\nVeteran services have a tendency to only understand what they expect to see. I served 33+ yrs and the doctors were great with young person problems, sprains and broken limbs but arthritis? Cardiac issues? The life expectancy for guys like me is about 5 yrs after retirement due to diseases that should have been spotted while we still served. By the time a civvy doctor spots it, the die is cast.\n\nI highly recommend getting a young therapist or a civilian one that still has an open mind to all possibilities rather than the closed mind of a long-in-the-tooth veteran specialist. The veteran specialists only care about your war wounds, not the pre-existing wounds that still bleed, still permeate through every part of your life, through every decision you make. You deserve better as do those around you.", "Mostly nta, but I highly suggest some therapy/counseling.", "ESH\n\n* You: The way you refer to Henri is seeping with hate. It wasn't his choice to be your responsibility for so long.\n* Your parents: They seem incapable of taking responsibility for their own child's needs. It was incredibly unfair of them to force you into spending your youth looking after someone else. Also, it's immoral of them to try using your medical connections to get Henri preferential treatment.", "NTA for feeling the way you do since there has been obvious neglect on your parents part toward you, but you are a major AH for the way you talk about your disabled brother, who doesn\u2019t choose to be that way. It makes me mad and sad, so I\u2019m not going to say anything more.", "ESH. \n\n* Henri is innocent in all this, and it's a *really* bad look that you're targeting him with this much resentment and cruelty. Regardless of his disabilities, he's still a human being, and he's still your brother.\n* Your parents are awful too. Why did they force you to take care of Henri instead of hiring a caregiver? And where do they get off trying to foist him on you, as though he's some sort of terrible burden rather than *their god damned son?* \n\nBasically the only one here who's not an asshole is Henri.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA/ESH because you should never have been out in a position where you, as a child, we\u2019re forced to make so many sacrifices and physically care for your brother. Of course you were/are resentful when your parents and other professionals around the child (and if your in the uk you 100% should have had a team of professionals working with your parents including OT and PT through the NHS, I have no clue what would be available in other countries). You should not have had uni held over your head. You should have been able to grow as a person outside of Henri and I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t given that childhood where you could have done your thing, then come home excited to tell henri all about it. \n\nBut the way you talk about Henri shows a lot of misplaced anger, he didn\u2019t force any of that on you. Your parents did, and Henri is still a person deserving of respect and kindness", "ESH. Henri is innocent and the amount of hatred and resentment you feel towards him is unjust. You seem to be harboring a ton of anger and misplacing it on your brother. However, you were forced to be a caregiver as a child, when you stood your ground you were kicked out, and now your parents are back wanting you to play the caregiver again. Your parents are definitely a-holes and you have every right to be furious with them.", "YTA for the (admittedly understandable) resentment of Henri. The bowling ball comparison in particular. You have a lot of anger towards him that should be directed at your parents. \n\nNTA for what you said to your parents otherwise about not wanting to be chained to him and your resentment for them. This seems to be a pretty common error where one kid has a problem, so it leads to the family entirely revolving around him and it completely messes with the lives of the other kids.  \n\nThis seems to be a common mistake parents make. See a lot of it here on Reddit.", "ESH it\u2019s not henri\u2019s fault", "ESA i mean taking care of your brother not your responsibility!!! That is his parents job and the should not have pushed in on you.\n\nBut maybe try to remember its not his fault either amd get some therapy as all that resentment is really bad for you mental health", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously you aren't a parent wow. This is intense.", "I am already under veteran's care services.  However, the vast bulk of my focus with my psychiatrist is much more focused on the things I experienced at war.  My psychiatrist even said that what happened with Henri is \"Mickey Mouse bullshit\" compared to what happened over there.  I know doctors are infamously bad at treating themselves, but in my opinion, I think he's right.", "Thank you sir.  It sounds like you may have walked an even harder road than I had.  The truth is that I rarely think about Henri or my parents. If that was all I had to deal with, I'd be thrilled.  If they didn't stroll in with grins like the goddamn Cheshire cat a week ago, I'd say it probably took up less than 1% of my brain space up until then.  It was really their stupid, shit eating grins which get me. \n\nI've been out for a little while and part of a civilian medical practice.  Everything in my country is the national health system, so there isn't a huge amount of difference, but I am able to find some good doctors.\n\nI am under care for a variety of issues, including hypertension, blood pressure and some gastro issues from shrapnel.  You know what helps the most?  Meditative yoga, if you can believe it.  Everything else helped a bit, but when I started that, my non-psych medical issues improved by leaps and bounds and it has worked wonders for my stress.", "Already in it through veteran's services where we have much, much bigger fish to fry.", "This is fair and I accept it. Thank you.", "Yeah I\u2019d say ESH, because you are supposedly a medical doctor and you are talking about a living person that way, like you shouldn\u2019t be a doctor if you talk like that. It\u2019s super upsetting. Honestly this whole story reads like it\u2019s fake and someone just trying to get attention. If it is real im sorry about the trauma your parents caused you to make you this way but it\u2019s not your brothers fault, and you should get therapy to work through some of that anger.", "I will accept almost all of what you say except this\n\n>he's still your brother.\n\nHe is a brother to me?  He has never done anything for me nor anybody else despite years of service to him.  Never spoken to me.  Never acknowledged me. Doesn't even know who I am.  Not that he can, but  be that as it may, the fern in my office has been as much of a brother to me as he ever has.", "Admittedly the bowling ball thing was said out of an outburst of anger upon them showing up out of nowhere.  However, I was actually trying to make a medical point. His case is utterly hopeless.\n\nI can't really get into specifics because his condition is sufficiently uncommon to risk identifying him (and by extension, myself) but in order for his condition to improve, things would need to happen in his brain which are currently impossible under medical science and not even remotely on the horizon.\n\nHe literally doesn't even know who his parents are, does not know his own name, does not even know when he is hungry, how to identify food, or anything else.\n\nI said it many times as an angry child or teenager. But this time I say as a physician there is really, truly nothing there to be done.  They are really throwing away their lives for nothing. \n\nThe real irony is that I shouldn't care that they are. But deep down, I wish they could find a few years of peace to themselves.", "I'm not looking to attack your therapist, but speaking as one myself who specialises in trauma, all kinds of trauma are worth treating, even \"Mickey Mouse bullshit\". If it's causing you this much anger and rage, it's having an impact on you. The way we are raised is always impactful and you need to sort out the issues with the early years if you want to forge a strong foundation upon which you can continue to heal.\nYour parents are TA. No child should raise a sibling or be forced to become their care taker. But Henri didn't ask for any of it and shouldn't be the focus of your anger.", "Yeah, I don't blame you for your reaction (doesn't make it the right one). \n\nThere are way too many stories on Reddit like this where one kid is basically sacrificed for another. \n\nHere is an extreme example:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3eoqds/confessions_of_a_donor_baby/", "I hear the rules here are very, very strict regarding certain things.  So, hopefully this is not against the rules.  Think of the grisliest war movie you've ever seen. Then dial it up to something that would NEVER get shown in a theater ever. And imagine it is not characters on a screen, but you and your friends.  Plus, also coming across a variety of atrocities against civilians that can't even be printed in papers because it is so inhuman.\n\nThe thing with Henri was a bad point in my life. But in terms of triaging things, that's like trying to compare the flu with leukemia.", "I've seen it in person while doing a surgery fellowship in Belgium.  The attending physician had to give a perfectly healthy six year old a spinal tap for their sister and was clawing at the walls and doors while they were trying to sedate him.  \n\nI had to leave the room and tell everyone it was my wounds.", "I work with war veterans, I have family who are too. Their trauma, their experiences are nothing I would ever consider minor or minimal. I listen to things which are raw and direct, and see footage first-hand at times. I'm sorry you ever went through any of it and I hope you can heal over time in a way which is meaningful to you. \nMy comment wasn't out of disrespect or rudeness or arguing against your therapist or yourself, but your post was so full of anger, hate and blatant disgust which appears to be highly misplaced or you just phrased it that way. I am not saying to refocus on the initial issues, I'm saying that it appears as though you really need to focus on everything you've experienced if you want to get past that rage.\nTake care :)", "You can suffer from multiple traumas.", "I didn't take it as disrespect or rudeness.  Rather, I just have to kind of be circumspect in talking about my experiences in the middle east due to the rules of this sub.\n\nDo I hate Henri?  Yes.  He has contributed nothing to the world except pain and anguish. He has ruined three lives. I know it isn't his fault and I know it isn't fair, but imagine that there was a thing out there and because it existed, you had experienced uncountable horrors in your life, never had a friend until you were 18 and saw them die at 20.  Never had a family--only taskmasters with only one thing in the world mattering to them. Henri.  With the sick irony that he never knew, much less cared how much was heaped at his feet, and none of it will ever make a damn bit of difference.  It was all for nothing.\n\nWas it only because of Henri? No. It was also my parents' choices, choices of certain geopolitical actors, choices of my country to get involved in a foreign war, and choices of war criminals that led to me going through what I had. But  can I disassociate Henri? No.\n\nIf I didn't have much, much, bigger fish to fry, yes I could see where you are coming from.  But right now, I have a lot more to unpack and deal with. Frankly, even newer things in my life that are more important, such as one of my patients who is a six year old girl who needs to get her entire colon removed.  I only have so much capacity. Far too much has been spent on Henri. Yes, I know it is ultimately for me if I can eventually move past it, but I need to not have Henri be front and center again.  I'll use whatever extra capital I have on bigger things.\n\nThank you for your time, kindness and patience.  I appreciate it.", "I really sincerely hope that you find only happiness in your life now and in the future. Thank you for the work you do to make this world a better place.", "Getting there!  I have my own son who I used to make sure to tell him every day that he is the most special, wonderful boy in the world who is second place to nobody and a wonderful wife who puts up with it all, and is always waiting with a glass of cabernet with a stew bubbling away on the stove.  Between you and I, the cabernet and beef bourginone works better than the therapy.\n\nKeep up your own good work!"]}
