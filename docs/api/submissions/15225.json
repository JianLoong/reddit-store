You don\u2019t get to play the victim when your ex wife was going through treatment and she couldn\u2019t be there for your needs when she was focusing on getting through the day and getting better.", "Here are two comments that make me lose hope in humanity", "Really? That's a pretty big generalization. What if the comment was \n\n\"wow :| just when I think I already couldn't think worse about gay men and how they treat their partners... fuck.\"", "How are a couple bad stories = to straight men all being abusive?", "You really should gift your username to one.", "Straight men?", "Thank you for killing me. \ud83e\udd23", "Thank you for killing me. \ud83e\udd23", "I highly doubt it was only a kiss...", "yeah I don't even see how this relationship is that fast? \n\nthe marriage was already crumbling when OP cheated. he'd been avoiding his wife for ages and not supporting her at all\n\nso it's not surprising that the cheating was the final straw and the relationship was dead and buried on the spot. even in a good healthy relationship cheating can be like an immediate game over, but if the relationship is already dead then it's just sort of a no-brainer\n\nshe leans on a long time friend who has already been helping and supporting her a lot in the aftermath. they grow closer still and eventually start dating. they don't get married until a year after the divorce is finalized, she doesn't get pregnant until a couple years after that. oh he is desperately trying to make it sound like he moved in the next week and they had a quickie wedding and a baby but like dude it's been four fucking years\n\ndid she maybe move faster with this friend than she would have with someone she didn't know? probably. but that's because if you start dating someone you have known for years you can skip a whole lot of the getting to know you part. even still, this isn't a terribly fast timeline for a dating relationship with someone you didn't previously know\n\nalso it's one thing to shut your partner out while emotionally relying on someone else in their stead. but his wife didn't shut him out, he shut her out. and he was totally fine with this friend hanging around the house and supporting her all the time up until he got kicked out for cheating", "> in front of god\n\nI mean Reddit has lots of users and all, but I don\u2019t think it goes that far", "What kind of shitty justification is this? Just because their needs aren't being met means it's ok? This is the exact same thing as someone's physical needs aren't being met........ Jesus Christ", "An emotional affair goes beyond feelings you can't control, though. It may not cross the line into physical intimacy, but there still has to be some amount of inappropriate contact/conversation/behavior/etc... otherwise, it's just a crush or mutual attraction and not an affair. \n\nThat's just in general, though. OP is obviously an unreliable narrator, and I am not accepting his word that an emotional affair took place.", "To be fair, you don't go straight from \" a friend of my husband's who helps with DIY\" to \" live-in partner\"out of nowhere. \n\nI'd guess that Elie and Silas had been getting closer for a while during OP's long work hours.", "Hooked up? OP mentions he leaned and kissed her barely before backing off, and she accused him with his ex-wife after that.\n\nSounds more like sexual harrassment if you ask me.", "True, idk I just personally find his comments abt how he treated his sick ex wife disturbing", "Well, in comments, he says that he was upset that she was to sick to \"meet his needs\" so  he chose to spend more time at work where he eventually kissed a coworker. So he decided to leave his sick wife for his job which lead to him cheating. While the only \"evidence\" of what he calls emotional cheating is that he *thinks* she moved on too quickly with his former best friend. Tbh if I were his ex-wife I wouldn't just nail that coffin shut, I'd also douse it in gasoline, set it on fire, and then push it off a cliff, and pray that the asshole never darkened my doorstep ever again.", "In what way did I say it was okay? I explained it. Also getting your dick wet vs seeking someone who actually treats you like a person and supports you js VERY different.", "It does appear I struck a nerve with you though", "Feels like silas helped taking care of the wife while OP didn't help enough", "I disagree, I've had that happen. Not because there was something before, but because after being betrayed he was there for me. Before  my ex cheating is was 100% committed and never even looked at other men. But after he cheated I needed support, and I got support. It felt so good te feel supported that we moved pretty quickly.", "Or cancer. Radiation and chemo can make it incredibly unlikely to conceive. I've heard babies conceived after cancer referred to as \"miracle babies\" for this reason, and I'm thinking OP might be one of the shockingly high percentage of men who cheat on their wives while the wives are fighting cancer.", "Did the coworker tell you it wasn't consensual? You seem to have information we don't", "Sounds like you don't know what sexual harassment is.", "The ocean is a better option.", "It struck a nerve in just how insanely asinine the comment was, yes.", "emotional affair is best reserved for people who essentially start treating someone new like their partner, simply without the physical elements of the relationship. like that dude who married a woman due to pressure but spends all his time with this guy who is clearly his life partner. he prioritised his \"friend\" over his wife in terms of how he allocated his time, in terms of emotional intimacy, in terms of whose feelings he was concerned with, etc\n\nbut these super loose definitions of \"emotional affair\" will have you calling countless things cheating when they're not at all\n\nfor example, lots of people are sexually attracted to lots of people. they walk down the street and pass multiple people they're sexually attracted to\n\nand a great many of those people are in happy monogamous long term relationships. they still feel attraction towards other people but they don't do anything to act on it. which tbh, is not *that* different from them when they were single, because most people who feel attraction regularly don't act on it most of the time. they don't act on it because some of those people are co-workers or service workers and it's inappropriate. or friends that they know they're incompatible with or whatever. a lot of people who feel attraction regularly don't even like casual sex and so only approach people they're interested in a long term relationship\n\nI know people who are attracted to half their friends but would never do anything to act it on. and they have a fantastic relationship with their partner. and their partner has no issue with them being friends with people they're attracted to, or sharing emotional intimacy with friends\n\nhell plenty of those people are queer couples who will actively discuss with each other who they find attractive, even though they're totally monogamous, they consider it like a fun hobby", "I would not accept assistance with medical/personal care from someone I only knew peripherally through my spouse. They were clearly cultivating an emotional connection before OP gave Elle an excuse to pull the trigger. \n\nLiterally everyone in this situation is not putting their best foot forward. OP isn't a vicious Neanderthal, Elle and Silas aren't saints. They're just flawed people reacting to a collection of stressors that would strain even the most ideal relationship.", "Awww poor baby didn't like an explanation. There's literally studies on the subject though, have fun reading up on them.", "having romantic feelings, being sexually attracted to, and neglecting your partner\u2019s needs for someone you tell everything to is hardly a loose definition", "see but you just described a long list of actions, not emotions, not thoughts. you're arguing with someone who is trying to draw a distinction between feelings/thoughts and actions. but instead of explaining why the feelings themselves are harmful, you're using actions to explain why the feelings are harmful..... which entirely misses their point\n\ndistancing yourself from your partner is an action, or rather lots of small repeated actions\n\nseeking someone's attention is again, lots of small repeated actions\n\nflirting is again, an action\n\nif you think that such feelings are only cheating when paired with these types of actions then you actually agree with the person you're arguing with", "You wouldn\u2019t, I would. Some people are really private around medical issues, others aren\u2019t at all. If Silas was OP\u2019s best friend, that\u2019s not exactly someone she barely knew. She probably already knew him pretty well. I\u2019d definitely feel comfortable with my partner\u2019s best friend helping me out."]}
