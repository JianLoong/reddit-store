And the fact that they would accept the invite is insane.", "NTA.  Just don\u2019t go.  You don\u2019t have to be around people who hurt you and if your parents can\u2019t respect that, they don\u2019t deserve you at their party.", "Guys I feel out of the loop. Where did y\u2019all get the info he cheated for \u201chalf a second\u201d lol. I just saw his comments but not where she was having medical problems.", "Garden party? I didn\u2019t know these existed outside of The Office.", "YTA it's them or you? Fine, don't go. I doubt anyone would be bothered.", "Non of these comments on who did what to whom is relevant.  Your parents are free to invite whom they choose to their home.  You are free to decline or accept your invitation.  That\u2019s all.  YTA for trying to manipulate the guest list.  Just stay home.", "YTA\n\nAlso your post and your comments prove normal peoples opinions of garden party rich people are right. Just a bunch of vain BS", "What a surprise she left you for your nurturing friend who was helping her while you were smooching coworkers.", "YTA for a number of reasons not the least of which is trying to dictate who your parents can invite to their party. Do everyone a favor and don't attend.  Spend the time really looking at who you are.", "So\u2026 you cheated on your wife because she was struggling with medical issues therefore couldn\u2019t cater to your every single need and didn\u2019t want to have sex.

Jesus.", "I just read the comments, but the comments from a few hours ago seemed to refer to a cheating part I don\u2019t see right now. Wow. YTA.

If she cheated then your family should support you, otherwise no.", "I would say both you and your ex wife and ex best friend are YTA,\n\nyou for kissing someone else while begin in a relationship\n\nyour wife was most likely having an affair with your ex-best friend even before this happened as there no way someone who is just out of a marriage few months later invite a new partner to move-in\n\nyour ex-best friend for having an affair with your ex wife before and after you divorced", "Nope. Not the asshole. Im sorry you had to go through this.  Its unbelievable that your family didnt even consider how you would feel. If i was in your situation, no questions asked I will not attend their party.", "YTA.  It's your parents thing, they can invite whoever they like.  You can attend and be polite or not attend.", "Uh, yeah, YTA OP.  Asking your parents to uninvite someone from their party just because you have beef with them is horrible.", "Adding in: he justified cheating on her because she was having medical problems and not paying enough attention to him", "YTA and actually I would say the same thing even if OP hadn\u2019t cheated. Considering the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect the parents to cut the ex-wife out unless her behavior had been super egregious and awful. They have an independent relationship with her that\u2019s probably pretty important to them.", "How do we know he cheated on her?", "If your parents can\u2019t respect that, they don\u2019t deserve you at their party.", "This should seriously be the top comment with ads the half ass \u201cit was all her fault\u201d that he\u2019s trying to peddle", "Yes this! OP sounds like a major AH", "Mind you he literally admitted his wife was medical complications when he cheated", "He has no proof of this \u201cemotional affair\u201d he claims she had one bc she started dating a friend of there\u2019s after the divorce bc there relationship \u201cmoved to quick\u201d that\u2019s his only evidence of this affair, and mind you this cheating on his part occurred while his wife was ill and not feeling good enough to \u201cmeet his needs\u201d", "[removed]", "Read the rest of the thread, OP is totally the asshole. Sure on just the original post he looks like not the ass but you need to get the whole story and oh damn is he the asshole", "Lead is buried in the comments: they divorced because OP cheated. Parents are choosing the non cheater over the cheater. They've known ex for the majority of her life; they just aren't cutting her out because of OP's actions", "Yeah no he forgot to mention that he cheated on his ex wife", "Read some of OP\u2019s comments, all I have to say is disgusting", "The kind of \u201cfuckery\u201d where OP cheated on their sick wife. OP, as is so beloved of the AITA cliche , fucked around and found out.", "Tbf, given he was the one that did the cheating on her, there's really no reason for everyone to cut her off for it.", "Maybe don\u2019t cheat on your spouse when they are sick than?", "He doesn't even have a proof of emotional cheating like conversations or something.

Op cheated on his sick wife with a coworker and then tries to save face by saying that she been having emotional affair behind his back for months without having any actual proof of it and is also salty that she moved on fast and was not hung up on his rotten ass.", "Go and filter out the old comments. Then the comments will pop up where op replied and clearly stated his wife was sick and was unable to be \"attentive\" to him.", "EXACTLY!!! And him leaving the info out and hiding it in comments and trying to blame her for being happy and moving of is disgusting", ">not paying enough attention to him\n\nMeaning she wouldn't have sex with him. Probably, because you know, she was sick.", "The classic James Sunderland play", "Automatically YTA because of this response", "OP mentions it in one of the comments here.", "Not sure how to link (on mobile) but check OPs comments on this post.", "he cheated on his sick wife and is acting like he's the victim, so yeah, i'd say no one deserves having him around.", "ah yeah that changes the whole thing", "He mentioned in a other comment that his ex wife was suffering from medical issues so she wasn\u2019t \u201cmeeting his needs\u201d", "Am i the person you think you're replying to?

I was 3 months pregnant and had morning sickness every morning which was extremely uncomfortable and gross.\n\nHe got mad cos I didn't want to have sex as soon as we woke up. He got angry at me and said, \"everything is the baby now.\" Didn't matter I felt like shit.  Just that he didn't get as much anymore.\n\nFun side note, he broke up with me when I was 6 months pregnant, outside the hospital before a monthly check up cos I was too focused on my baby and not on him.

Yeah I hate it when I slip and my mouth lands on someone else's.", "Where is your evidence of an emotional affair? Bc I see NOE", "...I literally thought that was just something people said in jokes.
