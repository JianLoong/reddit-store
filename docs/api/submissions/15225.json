They clearly are okay with you.", "This is actually a pretty easy one, even without the added information in the commentary. It basically comes down to this:\n\nYour parents are hosting an annual garden party and invited their long-time friends and, subsequently, the daughter and husband with their child. The only sticky area of this is your relationship with the daughter, being your ex-wife. When a couple is torn apart by divorce, things can get tricky, but not necessarily for this particular situation. \n\nThis is an annual event that your parents organize and enjoy hosting with the sole intention being to gather, catch up and socialize with their personal friends. These friends have been around for a very long time, and it should be expected that they would be invited (including their daughter who they have known and formed a relationship with, precluding and independent of your former marital status, for a very long time). \n\nA significant point is that it seems evident you have the opportunity to visit with your parents regularly, as that is how you discovered the invitation had been extended to the friend's daughter and her new family. It is also essential that this is a gathering for friends, it is not intended to be a family-specific event, such as a holiday, annual vacation, family reunion, etc.\n\nUpon being informed your ex-wife would be in attendance with her new family, you proceeded to deny them the right to invite who they choose to their own event. When that didn't fly, you gave them an ultimatum that they must choose between you and your ex. That is not only unfair, it is very controlling and manipulative!\n\nThis is your parents party for their friends and their enjoyment, it truly has nothing to do with you. If you cannot handle being around your ex-wife and her new family for a day, simply decline your invitation. There is no need to be argumentative, or controlling, or even remotely rude. This is not your house, not your event, and is not a party for your entertainment or pleasure. \n\nThis is their party, you were merely invited and have the option to accept or decline the invitation. What you do not have a right to do is demand when, where or how they run their event. Nor do you have the right to dictate who they invite or what takes place during it. You merely have the right to accept or decline attending. Were this an event primarily for family, that may be a different matter. It is not.\n\nYou would do well to learn and understand that your rights become more limited in scope at the very point where the rights of another person begin. You can dictate what you do, and how you do it; you do not get to make demands on what rights your parents exercise for themselves, particularly in their own home and with their own activities. Quite plainly, you have overstepped and owe your parents a huge apology. \n\nYes, absolutely.

If Elle was invited with her husband who was a stranger to you and her new baby, you may not love it, but would you insist on her being uninvited?

However, the way you went about it by giving your parents an ultimatum and insisting they retract the invitation could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nWhile it is understandable that you may not want to be around your ex wife and ex best friend, it is important to remember that your parents have their own relationships with them and may want to maintain those connections. It may be difficult for them to uninvite guests after they have already accepted the invitation.\n\nInstead of making demands, it may be more productive to have a conversation with your parents about your concerns and try to find a compromise that works for everyone.
