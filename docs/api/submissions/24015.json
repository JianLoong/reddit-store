I met her for lunch because we hadn't seen each other because I've been busy trying to arrange my affairs for my daughter (4F) and husband (32M) because I am having surgery to get my tubes removed. I had really bad postpartum psychosis after having my daughter so i am responsible enough to realize that having another kiddo isn't an option because of my mental health. \n\nDuring our lunch, i was explaining to her that i was nervous about having surgery. She then proceeded to go on about how she is still my friend, but she thinks I am wrong for having this surgery and I am letting down my husband and daughter for not having anymore children. I laid out my boundaries and told her that this wasn't up for debate and it was my decision how many kiddos I wanted and that my mental health could only handle one kiddo because I'd rather my little girl have her mother all there instead of a sibling and a mom who wasn't all there. She then proceeded to say \"If I had a husband, I could never do that to him. My faith (she's Catholic) wouldn't allow it.\" I then proceeded to ask our waiter for separate checks, paid my bill, told her to have a good rest of her day and came home. \n\nMy husband saw I was very flustered and he said he agrees with me being angry.

The type of surgery is irrelevant to her nerves. The friend gave her unsolicited opinion of OPs family planning, then passed judgemental of her decision (again, not the topic of discussion AT ALL). \"If I had a husband, I could never do that to him.\" Is judgemental as hell and unnecessary. We aren't ignoring that the friend said she doesn't value OP less, we just see the judgement she passed and know that sentence is insincere.", "Hahahaha my husband is the \"let's not make a scene\" guy but fortunately he met me after i chilled tf out", "My understanding is that Catholicism is a living faith - it gets worked out on earth, it can move and yet, it\u2019s amazing how both Catholic and Protestant Christians can move so far away from the actual New Testament, either by leaning into the old covenant (though no one\u2019s protesting mixed fabrics) or downright ignoring the gospels and apostles.", "You do make a valid point. I guess i reacted the way i did because she witnessed secondhand how i was postpartum (it wasn't pretty whatsoever) and still thinks having more kids is more important than taking care of myself. I would have probably been a bit nicer had she been unaware of my postpartum experience.", "I have to categorically disagree that people of faith need to make their opinions known. \n\nThe world would be a better place if people kept their opinions to themselves.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with you on Catholic doctrine and reproduction being very conservative. However, the OP had a serous life altering medical consequence of having a child. I am not up to speed on current Catholic discourse on this, but I do know that in Orthodox Judaism the life of the mother always takes precedence over children- even the unborn. (Yes I\u2019m sure you can find an outlier insane rabbi but overall this is true). However, it really should not matter what any \u201cofficial\u201d religious doctrine says. If your religion tells you to do something harmful to yourself or others, maybe it\u2019s not a good religion in the first place.  \n\nThe OP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d was vile. There are no two sides here. Post-partum depression and psychosis can lead to suicide or worse. Thankfully the OP is dealing with it. She needs better friends.", "Friends don't need to share opinions on what their friend is doing, especially after OP said enough. \n\nYour take is gross.", "Okay but your *loose version* is not actually what OP described happened.", "The church would respect her personal responsibility if anything", "\ud83e\udd23", "[deleted]", "100% nta, she did not act like a good friend. It can be difficult setting down boundaries with friends/family but you did the right thing. It was not her place to say all that, friendship does not mean every bit of your life is subject to unsolicited opinions. \n\nGood luck on your surgery, safe and speedy recovery.", "There isn't enough anti-religion sentiment in the world.", "Bro, it's not about anti-religion. Her values are different from op's and they happen to come from her religion. If it wasn't religion but cultural i would've said \"cultural beliefs\" instead of \"religion/beliefs\". Her friend values a husband and his hypothetical wants more than op's real life postpartum struggles, which her friend was aware of.\n\nEdit: i wonder if op asked for her opinion or if op was trying to talk about her feelings with a friend.", "No, evangelism is part of most religions.  Keeping opinions to themselves is the opposite of what christians are supposed to do.\n\nAgain, there is a right way and a wrong way to do this.  Jesus ate meals and enjoyed the company of sinners, but he also didn't keep the gospel to himself.", "I don't know all the details of Catholic doctrine, so please don't take this as authoritative.  I know this teaching is very difficult to follow, and I do think US bishops and priests have done a very poor job explaining this doctrine.  I think there is an exception in some serious circumstances. I don't know what they are, so I can't say if OP's situation would be one of them.\n\nBut the friend here is not vile.  She is trying to discourage OP from doing something the friend thinks is wrong.  Emma did it very poorly, but if Emma is supposed to understand OP's point of view, then we should try to understand Emma's point of view.", "What did I actually leave out? The part where her friend doesn't agree? That's because of her religion, which I did include, so that is basically what happened \ud83e\udd26\n\nBesides, a million and five people have their own opinions. That's why we come to AITA. best thing to do is to state yours and move on to another strip, rather than arguing with someone you don't agree with \ud83d\udc7b", "Because its whats happening in OP\u2019s life right now. Not every thought one has needs to be shared.", "Thank you. Part of recovery is me not being able to take my daughter to school (can't drive for awhile) but my SUPPORTIVE husband has me covered. \ud83d\ude05", "I think he had the whole throwing stones schtick too\u2026 then he did that whole thing in the temple. \n\nI never met the dude but im pretty sure he\u2019d be pretty against walkin around judging people everyone", "The problem is OP's friend didn't have her own opinion what she did was answer with something from her belief which is totally different, OP also didn't ask for her friends opinion yet alone get her friend to shame her for doing what she believes is best for HER and her OWN BODY not OP's friends body and mind\n\nHer friend should have left the religious part out of it and it would have been a good conversation but she chose to shame and mock OP and use her own religion to somehow make herself being better than OP because \u201dI wouldn't do that to my husband\u201d well good for you nobody asked you", "The part where she judged her and told her she\u2019s letting her husband and daughter down by not having more kids. That is a fucked up thing to say to a friend. You\u2019re also purposely excluding the fact that OP HAD A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE after birth and should not be having more kids. Emma is a fucking dick for putting her fairytale beliefs over her friends literal life, and you are too.", "[deleted]", "Great job on choosing the right partner in life and child raising!", "He forgave sinners, but also told them to go and sin no more.  He also told us to spread the gospel.", "It got brought up because she was nervous about a surgery and wanted comfort from a friend not a sermon", "\u2026because its whats happening in her life right now. \n\nIts also not a \u201csensitive topic\u201d. Ya dont get to have and share opinions on what *other people* do with their bodies.", "Your username is stinks\n\n\ud83d\ude09"]}
