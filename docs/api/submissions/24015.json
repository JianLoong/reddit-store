I met her for lunch because we hadn't seen each other because I've been busy trying to arrange my affairs for my daughter (4F) and husband (32M) because I am having surgery to get my tubes removed. I had really bad postpartum psychosis after having my daughter so i am responsible enough to realize that having another kiddo isn't an option because of my mental health. \n\nDuring our lunch, i was explaining to her that i was nervous about having surgery. She then proceeded to go on about how she is still my friend, but she thinks I am wrong for having this surgery and I am letting down my husband and daughter for not having anymore children. I laid out my boundaries and told her that this wasn't up for debate and it was my decision how many kiddos I wanted and that my mental health could only handle one kiddo because I'd rather my little girl have her mother all there instead of a sibling and a mom who wasn't all there. She then proceeded to say \"If I had a husband, I could never do that to him. My faith (she's Catholic) wouldn't allow it.\" I then proceeded to ask our waiter for separate checks, paid my bill, told her to have a good rest of her day and came home. \n\nMy husband saw I was very flustered and he said he agrees with me being angry.
