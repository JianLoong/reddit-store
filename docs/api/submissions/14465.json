He met my family for the first time last year and really hit it off with my sister and BIL and my parents seemed to like him, but they can be quite reserved generally. This incident happened when we visited for my sister's 30th birthday. We were out to dinner and it was my parents, BIL, sister and my niece. My sister is expecting her second child and Skye and my sister were talking baby names. She said she loved his name and asked how his parents chose it. He said his older brother actually named him. He was 5 when he was born and their parents allowed him to name him. My parents scoffed and said they doubted that were true. Skye told them his parents would say it themselves. That they would have allowed him the same had they had another child at some point. My sister and I told our parents some people do that and it wasn't right to dismiss it because they wouldn't. BIL said it actually sounded like a great idea and my sister agreed and they started talking about letting my niece name the baby and were asking Skye some questions. Skye said he and his brother love talking about how he named him, and his brother likes to think it helped prepare him for naming his own kid one day. My parents butted in again and said it was crazy to say his brother named him when parents clearly name their children. I told them yet again they were being rude and to stop. Skye said he wasn't trying to fight but his parents really did let his brother name him. My parents said he was a liar and clearly liked to spin a good story.\n\nAt this point I was furious. I told them they had no reason to sit there and call my boyfriend a liar just because they couldn't imagine someone letting their kid name a sibling. I told them THEY did not not my boyfriends parents and could not speak for them or him. They argued back it was a clear lie and I said no, that they were being assholes and how fucking dare they speak to Skye like that. My sister asked my parents to leave and said she didn't want to fight with them about it.\n\nAfterward my parents called both me and my sister and said I had no right to do that so harshly and publicly and they would be waiting for my apology.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681129458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hh8gt/aita_for_calling_my_parents_out_harshly_in_public/", "score": 263, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
