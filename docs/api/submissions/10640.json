Signed the lease and cat papers, but it turns out one roomie has severe cat allergies, but really wanted a cat in the home anyway. It\u2019s now ten months later and she wants me off the lease. I\u2019ve done everything from moving all cat supplies into my room, and deeply vacuuming the whole house every week to no avail.\n\nI wish I could do this for my roommate because she is also chronically ill, and moving would be hard for her. But I just got out of homelessness, and I think the stress would break me. I explained my situation and told her I can\u2019t move for her but can get her some manpower. She won\u2019t accept it, and suggested to get rid of the cat. The lil dude (cat) is for my PTSD. \n\nI renewed my lease today anyway because the fear consumed me, but feel guilty.

That\u2019s on her she should have never agreed to living with the cat in the first place. I\u2019m curious on what the other roommates think about this situation.", "NTA. You told them about the cat, before you signed the lease.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you randomly got a cat in the middle of the lease. You\u2019ve had the cat and your roommate knew. It\u2019s her own fault for not telling you she has a severe allergy.", "NTA. She never should have invited a cat into the home knowing she has allergies.", "NTA \n\n>\u2026one roomie has severe cat allergies, but really wanted a cat in the home anyway.\n\nShe can\u2019t just ask someone to move out or get rid of the cat that she agreed to house. You\u2019re on the lease, you paid the pet fee. You have the right to be there just as much as she does. She wanted a cat in the house and realized it wasn\u2019t a good idea after it was too late, sucks for her.", "NTA . Your roommate approved the cat, and now wants to backtrack. She is the one who should move. It would be different if you just brought a cat in with no discussion. NO WAY should you get rid of the cat. Your cat is a sentient being with feelings and your family. Your roommate messed up. If they didn't want the cat there, they should have told you before you signed the lease and moved in.", "NTA, and you'd still be NTA if your cat didn't help with your PTSD. The roommate OK'd a cat moving in- if she knew she had severe allergies and wasn't sure having a cat in the home would actually work out, she should have told you that up front and made this being a potentially temporary situation part  of the agreement.", "NTA - sure she's chronically ill but you checked if the cat was okay before moving in. If she had a problem then she should of said so then and there.  She's acting like it's so easy for you to just move even though i can tell that she knows full well it isn't. You are doing the right thing by cleaning up after yourself and if they have a problem with that then it's tough.", "If everyone signed off it on, you're NTA for simply existing with your cat.\n\nIt's a toughy though because on one hand, you can't be responsible for other people's health issues, especially if they already said it was okay.\n\nOn the other hand, living with roommates is about everyone making compromises to maintain order and peace in the home.\n\nAs a animal lover though, I couldn't wholeheartedly suggest rehoming the animal because I understand the bond.\n\n\nI would suggest to continue maintaining the cat dander to the best of your ability, while simultaneously looking for another place, just in case.", "NTA - I think you have to go with order of operations in this scenario.  You were invited onto the lease with a cat, which all roommates were okay with.  That's the point in time you should be judged by, not that the sick roommate was there before you.  If she \\*knew\\* she had cat allergies and invited you anyway, which it sounds like is the case from your wording, then you definitely aren't the AH.  If she didn't know she had cat allergies, then that gets trickier, but I still don't think it makes you the AH for staying.  It's just far closer to the dividing line between who should go and who should stay.  Generally speaking I'd side with physiological issues over psychological issues, though that's a dangerous rule given the way physiology and psychology intertwine.  It's a tough one.  I hate to say it, but I could see certain scenarios and \"what ifs\" where the best outcome is that all roommates in the house vote.", "NTA she knew about the cat and wanted to do it anyway. There\u2019s nothing else you can really do.", "NTA\n\nBecause of your response that the roommate knew they were allergic and still agreed to let the cat stay.", "NTA\n\n>was very clear to my roommates, and they were okay with it.\n\nThe roommate who has allergies should've spoke up and said no if it was going to be a problem.\n\nThis is now a her problem, not a you problem. If anyone is going to have to move, it is her. She agreed to it in the beginning, she cannot just change her mind and \"make\" you move.\n\nShe can go to the doctor for prescription allergy meds or move out.", "She has severe allergies \"but really wanted a cat anyway\" I'm sorry how is this in any way your fault?\n\nGood on you for renewing the lease, she can suck it up or move out. Just be careful she doesn't try to hurt or throw out the cat when you're not home.\n\nNTA all the way.", "I appreciate you all for your honest opinions.", "NTA. Why did she agree in the first place if she has allergies?", "Nta. Your roommate knew she was allergic and agreed to allow you to move in knowing you would be bringing your cat with you. That was a stupid decision on her part and she can't expect you to fix it by moving out.", "I don't know if you have documentation that shows that your cat is an emotional support animal, but if you don't, I would try to get that.", "NAH. I understand from both points, having both ptsd and severe allergies. There are things that can help with the allergies, has she tried them? I have a dog for my ptsd, and using a combination of air filters/medication helps a whole lot. (I'm on a long acting inhaler/steroid combo+generic clartin for sniffles etc) Also less fabric items it the house(dander can stick to it) and cleaning more often.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's her bad choice. As a fellow allergies plagued person I feel for her, but she made her bed, it's time she lies in it.", "NTA.  She can move.", "Nta she agreed to a cat.  If it is not working out she is breaking the agreement and she should be the one to move", "Does the roommate not take allergy meds? Get her some ceterizine... I'd be worried about her \"getting rid of\" the cat though tbh\n\nI'm allergic to cats and I own two of them. Make her bedroom a cat free zone if at all possible, she should keep her bedroom door closed at all times. Vaccuum daily. Get an air purifier. Those are my recommendations for now.", "Yes!", ">she knew she was allergic to cats but still said it was fine cause she wanted a cat in the house. That\u2019s on her she should have never agreed to living\n\nAgreed. OP you are NTA.", "She loves kitties a lot :(", "Thank you!! I do, I shall make copies from the leasing office then.", "This is something the roommate could do if they aren't yet.", "Then NTA, that was her stupid decision and if it\u2019s become too much for her then she needs to go", "Jeez, That's nuts. I guess her family never let her have a cat, for obvious reasons. But she always wanted one And she didn't know that The problematic results were going to outweigh her wants until she actually was around a live cat", "I'm allergic to cats (though i love them) and i cannot fathom why she would agree to it. She made a dumb decision which is on her. It's not like OP got the cat afterwards or she only then learned of the allergy NTA", "Thank you for your opinion. I empathize with allergic cat lovers.", "Even if she had learned of the allergen after the fact, OP would not be obligated to accommodate the roommate.", "NTA. I'd make sure the chip details are up to date, just in case.", "NTA you seem like a very sweet and caring person. Don't ever forget that. It sucks that she's struggling with a decision she made, but it's not on you to put yourself out so she doesn't have to face the consequences of her own decision. If it's so easy for her to tell you to move, it should be easy for her to move if it's really that big of an issue. \n\nIn my opinion, you are already consistently going above and beyond to try and make her comfortable. To me it sounds like she wanted the cat to adopt her as one of the kitties humans and it didn't so now she's upset because she decided the allergies wasn't a big deal for a furry friend. \n\nNone of this is your fault or your problem. If anything happens to your cat document it. If she decides to remove your cat from the house, start a case. Idk how rational she is, but I've heard horror stories of this going very poorly. What do your other roommates think about this situation?\n\nDo you think your other roommates would stop her from acting out against kitty?", "NTA\n\nShe knew what she was getting into. \n\nIf it bothers her that bad, she can move.", "NTA. You are allowed to have the cat under the lease. ITs her problem so she should move out.", "NTA", "Seems kind of moot now that you've re-upped already, but was moving somewhere else going to be financially untenable for you?\n\nI'm not really going to think you're the AH regardless, but in practical terms, if it would be much easier for you to move than it would be for her and there are no mitigating circumstances then I don't really see why that shouldn't be the solution. \n\nAnd if this is the only financially tenable place for the both of you then that just really sucks :(", "NTA, she knew what she was getting into and it's not your job to move.\n\nThat being said, consider getting or suggesting she get an air purifier (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/AROEVE-Purifiers-Purifier-Aromatherapy-Function/dp/B09YGT8CZ5/ref=sr_1_6). When I have friends over with cat allergies, vacuuming helps, but running the air purifier for a bit helps more. If you think about it, mostly she's not going to have skin contact with furniture/the floor, it's the dander/fur in the air that she's breathing that's triggering the allergies.\n\nI can't promise it'll 100% solve the problem, but it'll probably make an enormous difference.", "NTA. I\u2019ve probably read too many things on this sub but just in case I will urge you (if you haven\u2019t already) to make sure your cat is micro chipped and that you have papers proving ownership, in case your cat somehow \u201cescapes\u201d the apartment.", "I am allergic to cats, have 3 and also foster for the local animal shelter. Antihistamines are my friend!", "She might have thought that she would get used to it. I am allergic to cats. About 18 months ago I adopted my(35m) first ever pet, an adorable kitten. I did test out taking allergy medicine and visiting a friend with cats, and I was fine.\n\nFor the first 8 months I took the allergy medication every day. Then I started taking it less and less frequently, and I now no longer take it. I still have some minor allergies, mostly I'll get a small but not particularly severe rash if he rubs up against my face, but the really bad ones are gone.\n\nThe thing that gets me though is that the roommate has an existing chronic illness, which I would imagine would be exacerbated by allergies, and I would expect roommate to have taken this into account.\n\nNTA", "Some people have varying degrees to their allergies to cats. I've a friend who is allergic but grew up with her own cat, managing it with meds and such. And another where that's not an option and is pretty much deathly allergic. What baffles me is that. From the sound of it....the roomie didn't even disclose their allergy to OP?? That's insane. If it was something they believed and had experience managingthats one thing. But I'd have never agreed to sign a lease with someone with such a severe allergy. \n\n\nNTA because of the i go they withheld and them insisting you be the one to make the changes based on their initial bad decision. Delusional roomie."]}
