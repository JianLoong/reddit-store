Krish\u2019s brother, Sanjay(26M), finds me attractive and wants to get married to me. Feeling disgusted and angry, I immediately told them to fuck off. \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t happy with the proposal and tried arguing that I was still young and in school.

My sister is happy, lol. My parents are on my side, but they think I was a little disrespectful by calling them names. My sister also broke down and told them she needs time and is uncomfortable getting married now. They realised their mistake and apologised.
