Find a breas-feeding group or specialist. The more formula you give the baby, the less milk your breasts will produce. I nursed four babies.

I pumped and put extra in the freezer for babysitters, but my kids wouldn't take bottles so it never got used. The more the baby sucks, the more milk is produced. I wish doctors wouldn't tell women to give formula. They should advise young mothers to find a specialist to help.\n\nNow, on the subject of your MIL.....she is toxic. The first thing you need to do is establish some common ground with your husband regarding her proximity to you, her interference into your lives, and her intrusion into your personal choices.

Because that\u2019s what you have in addition to a husband problem.\n\nMIL doesn\u2019t want to help, MIL wants to take over, there is a difference.  FaceTiming every day is intrusive.  Ask your husband what it was like for him with his grandmother.  How often did he see his grandmother?  How often did she visit?  Did he see both grandmothers? Did either of them say the things his mother is saying??\n\nMIl thinks that by moving to your neighborhood, she can walk into your house anytime she wants and take the baby anytime she wants.\n\nSit down with your husband and talk about babysitting.  Babysitting is a job when you have an appointment or event and you cannot take the baby.  Therefore you need a sitter.  Babysitting are one off things, I have a dentist appt and really can\u2019t take the baby to that.  Realistically there are very few opportunities for babysitting, because your job now is raising your child, not passing the child off onto others.  Your child is not MILs emotional support animal.  So make a list of the things you do, and how often you need help or babysitting.  Your husband is a bit clueless\u2026 does he think his mother is going to come over and vacuum your house?  What does he mean by helping?  And babysitting is a rarity because the baby needs to bond with the mom and dad.  It\u2019s your job to raise the baby, not MILs.  I think this is his mother feeding him these things.  So go point by point that she can help once in a while, but in any given MONTH, that may be only a couple of hours.  What is she going to do the rest of the time??\n\nEveryone has a life story that is a book with many chapters.  In your life story, you have chapters on being a child, a teenager, a young adult, half of a married couple, and now you are in the raising kids chapter.  Each chapter has its own goals, constraints, priorities, cast of characters, main storyline, etc.  the main storyline of your current chapter is raising your baby.  There will be a new chapter on raising your toddler, etc\u2026 you have 18- 22 years to raise your child directing want you want the, to learn how you are teaching the, values, good behavior,etc.  once they become an adult, they will move out to build their own lives.  And then you will start a new chapter, called the empty nester chapter where you need to get a new life purpose because your kids are adults now and don\u2019t need you much.  So you will take up hobbies or new activities or volunteering or a side business or traveling or whatever you couldn\u2019t do when you were busy raising your kids.  Somewhere in your empty nester chapter will be a page on your kids weddings.  There may be a couple of pages on your grandkids, but that will only be a couple of pages because your adult sons or daughters will be raising their kids.  That\u2019s the circle of life\u2026\n\nYour MIl is in the empty nester chapter.  And it sounds like she didn\u2019t get a new life purpose when her kids grew up and moved out.  She just hung out waiting for grandkids so she would get another chance to raise babies.  The problem is that she raised her kids, and it\u2019s your turn to raise yours.  So moving here to help you is a nice idea, but you don\u2019t need full time help.  You don\u2019t need part time help.  You need once in a while help.  So what is MIL going to be doing with the rest of her time?? And why would she buy a house when she doesn\u2019t have kids to raise??  Why wouldn\u2019t she look at a senior living community where there are lots of social activities and amenities where she can make friends and go on outings with people her own age??  That\u2019s what she should be doing with 95% of her time.\n\nSo that is the question that your husband needs to pose to his mother.  What is she going to be doing 95% of the time she is here because being a grandma is only 5% of the time.  And why would she buy a house in a neighborhood where everyone is raising kids when she already raised hers.  Why isn\u2019t she looking at a condo or apartment ina senior community where she has access to social activities, outings, and amen so she can build a new circle of friends?  She is only going to get 2 hours/ per week (Sunday lunch and playtime with the baby) and maybe date night once a month.  So what is her plan for the other 95% of the time?  Hanging out at your house won\u2019t be an option because you need to live your own lives without MOM hanging around telling you what to do.", "If you spend time on forums dedicated to hating on MILs, then all you will see is the negative sides of your own MIL. That\u2019s not healthy and not good for your marriage or for your daughter. Please don\u2019t hang out there. Focus on the good that can come from having a positive loving relationship with the woman who raised your husband, and who your husband loves. Your lives will be so much happier for it, I promise. Just give her a chance. She\u2019s just excited to meet and know and love her granddaughter. That\u2019s a good thing!", ">The woman clearly wants to be involved with her grandchild, but OP only wants her own family involved, which will make things tense.\n\n\n\nHow? \n\nSomeone who is this intrusive needs serious boundaries. \n\nShe sold her fucking house!", "Make sure you are clear with your husband that she will not be staying with you. No way, no how. \nAnd that she will not have a key to your house, ever. \nShe can move, that\u2019s her decision. Doesn\u2019t mean she will have unrestricted access to your house and child. \nAnd if she criticises you in your own home, she gets kicked out. And he has to be the one to lay down these rules and hold the line, including kicking her out. \nIf he won\u2019t agree to support you in all of this the you dint have a MIL problem, you have a husband problem.", "Who cares if it's the first grandchild? I hate people that treat the first differently than the 20th. They are all grandchildren and she wants to meet them all.\n\nI understand not liking her, she's rude.\n\nBeing rude and innapropriate doesn't make someone a psycho b\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. That's a fcked up thing to say about your MIL.\n\nAnd she doesn't need your authorization to move homes. Of course she shouldn't expect to stay with you without asking and you can say no to that.\n\nAnd like the other commenter said just let the woman meet her grandchild. I don't agree how she's treating you but I understand her not caring about the person who's keeping her away from her grandchild.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
