Don\u2019t let what he said get to you, dude. He\u2019s just trying to make a sale. It\u2019s like when those MLM ladies will tell you that you *need* their essential oils to be healthy or their shampoo bc your hair looks like shit. They\u2019re just saying what they have to, to make some money off you.", "I\u2019d report him to the gym management. He interfered  with your workout and insulted you.", "NTA he's just trying to sell his business. You handled it fine. Don't spend any more time thinking about it tbh.", "NTA.\n\nHe is being the asshole by using hardcore sales techniques on you at the gym. The first one he used was the \"presumptive close\". Like if you go into a car dealership and instead of asking  what you are looking for, they walk over to an expensive one and say, \"What color would you like this in?\" And then the second sales tactic was dissing you. \"Oh, your form is shit. *Smirk.* You really **should** have a trainer.\"\n\nWhen someone is rude to you, you don't need to worry about the subtleties of politeness. A simple, \"No thank you,\" is plenty. And if they try again, \"No,\" again.", "NTA\n\nThis guy is just trying to sell you something. You don't owe him anything. Being direct is fine. If he approaches you again, tell him you prefer to work out solo. If he doesn't leave you alone, report him to management.", "NTA. \n\nHe's trying to drum up business for himself. His initial approach was fine, and there's nothing really wrong with him asking (nor anything wrong with you declining the offer). Your answer here (\"I'm not looking for a trainer\") was perfectly polite and should have been the end of it.\n\nBut it wasn't - that's where this changed from a no-assholes-here situation to a he's-a-complete-asshole.  \"You should\" is terribly unprofessional - he's trying to get your money in the same way sleazy guys try to get dates, by insulting you. \n\nHe's a loser. If you ever do want to use a trainer, find someone who uses their skills as a trainer as a selling point, not someone who's just out for a buck.", "NTA  His statement was inappropriate, condescending, AND unproffesional.", "That\u2019s so rude. If he was a good trainer he would be positive. He would tell you how great it would be to train with him and let him know if you are interested in a session, maybe even a discount first session!\n\nGood trainers are not begging for clients and disparaging potential ones. Good riddance", "NTA. This guy sounds unprofessional and for that i\u2019m guessing he also gets zero business so he just harasses people. His comment just proved that hes not a good trained. Tune him out as best as possible in the gym and if he still is constantly insisting I would just bring up the bother to the gym staff.", "NTA - that trainer is disrespectful and pushy. I\u2019d leave a review about it and change gyms lol", "NTA.   He is trying to sell you a service.  You are telling him no.  Nothing makes you an AH.  \n\nThat said, his tactics border into AH territory.   Engaging you in conversation is fair game, as is trying to sell you training services (provided he works for the gym).  Adjusting your equipment is interfering with your workout.  And his condescending comments to you are pretty bad.  \n\nHe should be talking up how his services will benefit you and  his ability to help you on your journey, rather than tearing you down.", "I\u2019m a personal trainer. What he did is fucked up. The whole approaching people on the floor thing is super uncomfortable to me. Report that to his gym. Go to his manager, his district manager and whoever else you need. Say that this trainer kept harassing you and when you declined to train with him he insulted you and you no longer feel comfortable going to the gym.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it appropraitely. You were honest and direct. You didn't berate or yell at them, you didn't insult or curse. \n\nPart of his job is convincing people to use his services. If he doesn't have a client, he's probably not getting paid (or getting paid as much). If he's decided being an asshole is the right tactic, that's on him, it's not on you to capitulate.", "He\u2019s the AH.  WTH.", "NTA and F that trainer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is the sort of thing that you go to a manager about. He's insulting the members of the gym and that's going to make people stop showing up.", "Yeah if someone came up to me while I was working out and messed with my machine I would kill them.

At least that trainer was nicer than many I have come across.", "OP should ask him for a freebie. If pressed, offer 'exposure' among his friend group.", "His initial approach was not fine. Don't touch someone's machine without their permission.", "Yeah if they were actually damaging their body the trainer should\u2019ve mentioned the specific issues he noticed instead of waiting a month to vaguely ask for money again."]}
