Will it make your parents non-abusive/neglectful?  It is not your responsibility to take on that role either way, but it would be such a waste to take it on at your own expense while not actually accomplishing anything to help him.\n\nSecond, by going away to college, you may be in a better place to provide a refuge for your brother in the long run.

You want to be there for your mother and brother but before you can do so you need to take care of your education so you will be successful first.

Your hard work during a really tough time is commendable and should be celebrated. \ud83c\udf89\n\nI went to uni 12 hours away to get away from my family's chaos. It was the best choice I ever made.  I'm not going to lie to you,  sometimes it will be hard getting updates from home and feeling like you need to fix it.  This is not your job!! Your job is to focus on your education and becoming the person you were designed to be. \ud83d\udc9c\n\nMany universities have counseling and  first-gen / low-income student services (not assuming but in case you are paying for school yourself). These were not available when i was at school but I work at a university now and see how valuable they are to students.  Contact these offices as soon as possible to get on the schedule for meetings/info sessions. \nTherapy and taking advantage of services that help you navigate your college needs is really important for every student.   It's essential when you don't have a supportive community/ family back home. You can do this and your reddit fam is cheering you on!", "How is your father crossing the line?  Physical violence?  Emotional abuse?  I am not questioning your account at all, but want to help you find a workable answer here because I truly believe that it is best for you and your brother in the long run for you to go away to school.  \n\nBut if you really can\u2019t get comfortable with the idea, are there colleges closer to home you could apply to?  Throwing away your chance to earn a college degree would be a terrible outcome here.", "Thanks for the advice this really helped", "He has been emotionally abusive to us so far and had been physically abusive with my mother in the past but had stopped a few years ago when his health deteriorated. But the emotional and verbal abuse still continues. I defend my brother and my mom most of the time from him because the fights he starts can get really messy. \nI am also afraid if i managed to get away from this , i will be leaving my brother and my mom defenseless.", "It isn\u2019t up to you to defend your mom. The best you can do right now is to go to school, graduate the HELL out of that place, get a great job, and then when you\u2019re settled and stable, take care of your brother if he needs it. \n\nYou\u2019ve been a great role model for him, which is awesome because it sounds like your parents haven\u2019t done that. I\u2019ll bet he can hold his own. Talk to him and tell him your plans and give him advice on how to stay safe while you\u2019re away. Keep the lines of communication open with him. Tell him that if he\u2019s ever not safe, he can talk to teachers or counselors at his school that will help the family turn things around. \n\nI\u2019m a younger sibling myself, and when my older brother went off to college despite a bunch a terrible stuff that was going on in our family, I cheered him on and knew that if I needed something, he was still a person I could turn to. I knew that him having a college degree was in my best interest, too. I\u2019m sure your brother will have the same feeling. \n\nAlso, your university likely has some mental health/counseling resources, so look into those and see if they might help you heal. \n\nFly free and be safe, kiddo!", "Thank you so much this comment literally brought tears to my eyes"]}
