It sounds like she needs help of some kind \u2014 possibly medical, possibly psychological or psychiatric \u2014 and some serious education on hygiene, blood contamination, and self-care. \n\nI would recommend perhaps having your wife approach her about period care including different products, safe practices (including cleaning up and topics like toxic shock, reproductive system illnesses, etc.), and your DIL\u2019s background.  Your DIL may need to see an OB or GP, as that sounds like an extremely excessive amount of blood. If her cycle is making her sick, that might suggest an underlying medical problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nHaving a menstrual cycle just happens one day and the process of caring for it is NOT intuitive. It\u2019s not something people inherently understand how to take care of. Many women are not properly educated for a number of reasons, including parental neglect. That, and other forms of trauma and mental health conditions (depression, PTSD, even a history of being shamed for bodily functions) can affect a person\u2019s personal hygiene.\n\nI\u2019m not defending the DIL leaving such a mess, of course. Blood is inherently an unsafe fluid for others to contact. That is unacceptable. But the reasons behind why that happened are genuinely concerning.  You and your wife have the opportunity here to help this young woman for her own good and the good of your grandchildren.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people commenting that being on her menstrual cycle is not the same as being sick. Yes and no! Menstruation is something that people learn to endure, and for many it is NOT painful or life-interrupting (more of an inconvenience). HOWEVER, there are a number of medical issues associated with the menstrual cycle that do cause severe, sometimes debilitating symptoms (severe pain, heavy bleeding/anemia, difficulty urinating or defecating, blood pressure changes, etc). Endometriosis, endometritis, PCOS, PID, ovarian cysts (which grow with the hormone cycle and sometimes burst), cervical cysts (see ovarian cysts), reproductive organ infections/inflammatory disorders, certain cancers and pre-cancers etc. are commonly not diagnosed because they\u2019re dismissed as a bad cycle or as someone overexaggerating.\n\nReaders: if you or someone you love tells you they\u2019re in pain, it is better to believe them and feel a little foolish than to tell them to ignore something that might be medically significant. That goes for kids and adults. Even a cry for attention is a sign that someone needs help, even if it\u2019s not in the way you initially expect.", "They are looking for their own home.

It must have been an accident, @OP is describing two isolated incidents and is also taking issue with her not being able to come to Church. The way OP describes periods is very strange, calls it a sickness. Part of my family is Hindu and another part is Muslim, both religions consider a woman on her period to be \"unclean, dirty, unholy\". You can't touch any religious artifacts in your home, (for example my dad has to light a small  diya light every morning to bless whatever God was \"protecting our house\" and he would remind me to not light it when I was unholy and dirty). My sister is Muslim and she can't touch the Quran, entre a mosque or pray while on her period, it's considered an impurity. \n\nCalling it a sickness is a dog whistle for conservative speak. I get she had *2* gross encounters, one she was willing to clean and the other one we don't know if it was on purpose or an accident but OP left out the part of how it was dealt with and how she treated it. If you broke a plate by accident in your in laws and leave to get a broom should you be ostricized? Or even a second time was the cut? What other unhygienic things is she doing? How about her poop and pee? No mention of that, she clearly flushes properly or else OP would definitely mention it. What about dishes and food waste?

Like, for me personally, it's one of the worst smells in the world, but I have trauma dealing with period blood that breaks sub rules.

No one wants to deal with somebody that forgets to clean up after themselves either. \n\nFWIW, my fiance would throw an absolute fit if I washed my bloody clothes with hers. Hell, she already really doesn't like it if I've got to wash something my dog got sick on, instead opting often to just replace whatever item it was. My point here being that what's okay to some definitely isn't to others, and if this is something that OP is very much not okay with, we'll the DIL needs to ensure she picks up after herself every time. \n\nAgain, I agree with you that periods shouldn't be taboo or demonized.
