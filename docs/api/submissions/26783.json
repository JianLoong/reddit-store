Talking to people without threatening them will almost always yield better results.", "So your supposition is this woman, who has never before (to OP\u2019s knowledge) left a used tampon out, decided that day was the day she was going to for\u2026 fun? A prank?", "What\u2019s your supposition for why it happened here, then, if not an accident? She hasn\u2019t done it before. You think today is just the day she was like \u201cyeah imma leave this tampon on the floor here\u201d?", "That only leaves \u201con purpose.\u201d Why?? This just isn\u2019t a realistic scenario to me. That a woman who has never done so before just randomly chooses to leave a used tampon on the floor.", "You can more easily conceive that a woman, who has never done so before (to OP\u2019s knowledge) would just randomly decide one day to intentionally leave a tampon on the floor?\n\nSomeone dropping or forgetting something seems more likely to me.", "Why did they say sick in the post? \n\nVery confusing.", "I mean I do agree with you, it likely was just an accident. OP did go a bit over the top with the reaction, but I do feel like they're not entirely off the mark in warning that if it does happen again, they're out.", "I agree. It sounds like a situation that would have been better handled with some compassion rather than rushing to judgment.", "Or she just dropped it on the floor just as a random accident. It happens. \n\nThis reminds me of a time some years ago. Back when I used to dye my hair red. I also use a menstrual cup. For years I had been telling my partner to not walk in on me on the bathroom. Like don\u2019t even talk to me in the bathroom. Idc if the door is wide open and I\u2019m just standing there, this is the one place I want to be able to just piss or pick at a chin hair in my own bubble of mental privacy. \n\nAnyway, one day I was showering, and I had just dumped my cup in the shower when my bf barged in. It was a heavy flow day.  He looked at the red water and said \u201cdid you\u2026 just dye your hair?\u201d \n\nNope. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t walked in on me since. I don\u2019t think he was traumatized by the period blood as he\u2019s quite enlightened about it, but I guess it was enough of a shock to reinforce the message. I don\u2019t think he grasped just how much blood there is. \n\nI have to deal with it for a whole week every 4 weeks. 25% of my adult life. If you have to see evidence of it once or twice, TS.", "seriously, lol.  it's blood, not a biohazard.", "Sounds like an escalating mental health issue to me.", " I'm guessing because most men think feeling like crap due to a normal body function is just sickness\n\n Most males think a period is gross and sick.\n\n  Hell I'm a girl and I find my period gross at times too depending on how heavy my flow is.", "But why? Why is this such a big deal that a single occurrence is worthy of threat of eviction? \n\nRepeated offenses, sure.\n\nSay \u201chey you left a tampon on the floor\u201d of just pick it up and throw it away and move on. It\u2019s not much different from a Kleenex you used to apply pressure to your cut finger and forgot about on the bathroom counter.", "I would just have picked it up and thrown it away. Action/conversation is not required if it\u2019s not a pattern IMO. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not scared of period blood the way some people seem to be, but if I were too scared to pick it up I\u2019d just say \u201cDIL you dropped your tampon can you clean it up?\u201d\n\nThis is literally just an accident relating to a normal bodily function. It wasn\u2019t even a puddle of blood, it was already contained. It is truly no big deal.", "Comparing a bloody tampon to a used tissue used to stop a finger bleeding is a little disingenuous, as bits of your uterine lining isn't coming through your finger. Even still, it's not sanitary whether it's a tampon or a tissue, and no one wants to pick up after another person like that. \n\nBut I agree, there ought to be some grace given regarding mistakes. OP has put the DIL on warning that it isn't to happen again. OP isn't throwing her out for a single offense. Ultimately, it is OPs home that the son and DIL are living in, and they need to be respectful of that, and respect that OP will not put up with much more of it. \n\n\n(All this being said, I'm of the opinion that, as a society, we do not appropriately handle menstruation. It is natural and a by-product of our evolutionary path, and it's nothing to feel shame about. On the flip side, it's not a fair excuse for women to treat others poorly just because they are on that part of the cycle - which I'm no means implying the DIL was doing in this instance)", "Exactly! The things I cleaned up raising children are way worse than a used tampon.", "What\u2019s different about uterine lining that makes it worse than regular blood?\n\nThe actual harm done from this is zero and so is the potential harm unless you eat it or something (and I feel like the tampon would be worse than the blood on it.)\n\nI\u2019m not discounting the ick factor, it\u2019s yucky because it came out of a yucky vagina with cooties or something, but it only goes so far. Not this far, IMO. What is it we find so offensive about period blood?\n\nI know a guy who pitched a fit because his gf threw her used menstrual cloth pads into a joint load of laundry (the pads were rinsed not clotty, it was her machine, her house, plus, you know, soap.)\n\nI just don\u2019t get it. You can think it\u2019s gross (it is,) expect people to be responsible and clean about it, but if once a while you see something from a period, what\u2019s the big deal?"]}
