His mom would show up unannounced at our house often. She always gave her opinion: the house, myself, and her son. She talked to my husband about me behind my back. She would say \"I don't approve of you living together.\" And \"If you two ever have a child I want nothing to do with it.\" It was around this time she was showing signs of dementia (weakness, forgetfulness) I also learned that she had narcissistic tendencies and was emotionally abusive to her family. I ignored all this and even went over to her house often to help her with things like clean her house.\nAugust 2021. Almost simultaneously, I get pregnant and engaged. My husband started with the news of our engagement. His mother said, \"Oh good, I am so glad that you will no longer be living in sin.\" To which my husband replied, \"yep, and OP is pregnant.\" She shut down and didn't talk to me for 2 months. \n\nWe had a small wedding in November. She was upset that she didn't get asked to do anything, and so she decided that she would throw my baby shower. When I found out she was planning my baby shower, I immediately asked her to please stop. I told her that I had already asked my little sister and friends to throw it for me and I invited her to help them if she wanted. Truly I was shocked she cared, I was 7 months pregnant and she NEVER asked about my pregnancy. I had this conversation with her 3 times and so did my husband.\n\n After that, she cried bc she was upset but said she understood and would stop all of her planning. Instead, she, her sister and her friends and went to my venue early and set up an entirely different shower without telling anyone. MIL and her sister were intensely rude to every single guest (some even walked out). About a week later, I got together with her to tell her how upset I was that she went behind my back to do the shower. She told me, \"I never wanted you as a daughter in law. I never wanted you in my family.\" I left, and told my husband I didn't want to be around her. When he told her to apologize, she said \"No, I didn't do anything wrong.\" My husband repeated the things that she said to me back to her and she denied ever saying them.\n\n I told my husband that because she crossed this emotional boundary, I wanted to set up a physical boundary. She was no longer allowed at our house. Since then, I have suffered from intense postpartum anxiety and depression and I think about the things that she said to me and about my son everyday.\n\nHe is now 6 months old. She doesn't know his name. She can no longer dress herself and she wrecked her vehicle last week. My husbands family hates me. They are in denial that she has dementia and they blame me for her rapid decline due to \"stress\". Any boundary I attempt to set up gets torn down and I feel like my husband is sitting on the fence trying to please both sides.

Two things happened at the same time, her dementia and the way she treated you. While it\u2019s sad she\u2019s sick, it doesn\u2019t mean you should negate what happened.

Your husband should be more on your side and shielding you from his family and should not be on the fence. He needs to protect you and your child. I hope you have some family and friends who you can lean on. For your mental health consider a therapist and even meds if you need/want them. You shouldnt have to be in so much mental and emotional pain. \nThis is a terrible situation you are in. Take care of yourself!", "NTA -  your in-laws need a reality check.  Dementia has its own speed and nothing can change it without immediate medical intervention and medication.  Protect your child and husband at all costs.", "NTA for setting the boundary about you. Does your husband have contact with his mother?", "NTA\nAs a niece of someone who passed with dementia, who generally was a nice lady, but became very cruel and unpredictable, you are doing the right thing..", "NTA.  It's your husband duty to take care of his mother, let him work out some solution about her with his family Considering her mental state she should not be around your child, and it is right thing to have a firm boundary around that. What worries me is that your husband is on the fence about it, he should be on your side wholeheartedly.", "NTA, here's my thing, your real issue is your husband. He should be picking a side, and the side is that you deserve to be treated right and your son deserves to be safe. He doesn't get to sit on the fence because him sitting on the fence is choosing to allow his family to speak to you with disrespect and not step in.\n\nI'm saying you need to have a real come to Jesus with your husband about how wrong it is that he continued to allow his mother to disrespect you and can't even say with commitment that what she did was wrong. He chose to marry you, he should have your back when someone is being cruel to you", "NTA very unfortunate. Don't get to pick your family, but you and your husband picked each other. Hopefully you both can keep good communication with each other and can get through this for the best result for your situation.", "NTA. I can confirm that any semblance of a filter goes away and their anger and other emotions increase 10 fold. Please get therapy to discuss everything that happened- they will talk to you about how she likely didn\u2019t mean everything she said 100%. Although she sounds like a vengeful narcissist still, she might have been able to be decent for the sake of her so . However- you. Don\u2019t. Need. Her. And you don\u2019t need his family either! My aunts an uncles did not believe my grandma\u2019s diagnosis when she first started showing signs either. Even up to around the time she died, they talked about her getting better. I couldn\u2019t decide if they were convincing themselves of this, or if they actually thought it. I mean it was very obvious. I would expect your husband\u2019s family to be the same. Please petition to get her driver\u2019s license taken away, and get someone to take her to a neurologist. I\u2019m so sorry. Baby is alive?

Any actions shes taken in the past year have to be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nThen again you say she was apparently always like this......sigh...\n\nBut you have every right to do. For a Long time now she has made clear her pure hatred for YOU in particular. If anything you are simply fulfilling her wishes", "She's ill. She needs support.

You should not have to put up with any of this and your husband needs to support you.", "Your husband is a husband and father before he is a son.\n\nI feel like I have to say that a lot, but in my opinion being around your mother in law would be destabilizing to you and your family, therefore having her in your life should not be on the table in any universe, under any circumstance. \n\nThe opinions of your extended in laws have no place in your home. Those people cannot keep your family upright from any distance but they can sink it up close. \n\nNTA", "It's amazing how people can not see what's directly infront of them, keep your boundaries firm, it's not your fault, she could have been alot kinder an things would be different, enjoy raising your son around people you love", "NTA. I can somewhat excuse MIL because of her dementia, however, her family is very wrong to enable her behaviour, and to hate on you. That is despicable. At the very least, they should aplogise to you for how she is behaving, not being in complete denial.", "NTA, but also wanted to point out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>rapid decline due to \"stress\"\n\nThis is a real thing", "It doesn\u2019t make it any better since it\u2019s been ongoing, but from personal experience in my family, medical issues like strokes and dementia make \u201cinside thoughts\u201d come out like word vomit to the point that they will insist they never said it. My mother has always been super narcissistic and emotionally abusive, but now can no longer control the words or aggression so now she does it in front of other people and doesn\u2019t even realize it. Other family members were similar. It\u2019s certainly not an excuse because she was obviously still thinking it, but maybe it\u2019s a little easier to swallow knowing that she wasn\u2019t fully in control of her faculties when it came out. NTA", "NTA", "Thank you.. I am in therapy and limit all contact with his family, but it just keeps getting worse.", "Yes, multiple days a week. I've never put limits on him seeing his parents, I just said my son and I won't be around his mom", "It's a hard disease for sure, and I do have sympathy for my husband for going through this. I'm sorry your grandma had it as well! You're right, his family is in denial so they won't take her to get help.\n\nI am in therapy once a week and it helps, but it's so hard to work through. And yes, baby is THRIVING! I want to limit her contact with him because I know she will treat him the same way.

Dementia sucks, but don\u2019t expect people to take care of you when you have dementia if you were an asshole/abusive to others all your life.", "That support can't come from someone who is trying to look after a 6 month old baby though. You can't care for an infant and also a person who irrationally wants to destroy you at the same time, it's going to end in tragedy.", "I don't doubt that part. There are MANY factors to her rapid decline, each very unfortunate and I do feel bad for her situation. However, the issue I see is me becoming the entire cause of her stress, thus the cause of her illness. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, idk.", "I've been trying to be super empathetic to that, but it's still so hard not to take it personality. I'm also afraid that she will take her blurting episodes out on my son, and he absolutely doesn't deserve it. She's declined so quickly, it makes me wonder how much time she has left. In your experience, how long did your family members stay somewhat lucid while they were declining?", "Please also get your husband counseling and couples therapy. This will tear you apart if you aren\u2019t incredibly proactive now. I wish you luck!", "You haven't done anything wrong. Family dynamics are so difficult. I'm NC with my mother. I've made it very clear that this is my personal decision and everyone else in the family should make their own. It sounds like you are doing the same and that's the right way to handle it.", "I didn't read it like it was all her life but may have misunderstood", "No you're fine. Was just saying it bc you put quotes around it. Definitely NTA either way, it's not your fault.", "Thank you for the advice, I have been trying to get my husband to go to therapy with me but of course his mother is a retired therapist who counseled my husband to death (In a bad way) and now he is pessimistic about all therapists. I'm hoping we can compromise and just go a few times, even that much would help.", "Exactly, you need to be in couples therapy because him choosing not to be your partner will tear apart your relationship if he doesn't put the work in.", "Ah yes, I can see how that's confusing. But you're right, it definitely makes many things worse!! Thank you for your comment.", "Oh boy, that\u2019s\u2026 good luck. I sincerely hope you can work through this, but if not, that you\u2019re able to create the life you want (and deserve) for you and baby.", "Yup. And by riding that fence, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s choosing. OP- please heed our words. You deserve better!", "Thank you \ud83d\ude2d we've been trying so hard to work through it and some days it feels impossible. He's also an only child...
