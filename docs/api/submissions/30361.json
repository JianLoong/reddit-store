She shouldn't have touched your hair in the first place.", "NTA", "NTA. I also am afflicted with curls. Once you've washed/wetted and maybe added product  - it cannot be touched!

If the woman thought it was all right to do it, then it was all right to do it back; if she didn't like it then she's getting a taste of her own medicine, which hopefully woke her up to what she was actually doing to others -- which was the point. \"Just as bad\" my ass.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I usually ask really loudly if I look like a labradoodle and ask why they are petting me and to take their fetish elsewhere.
