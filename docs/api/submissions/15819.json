{"id": 15819, "submission_id": "130qo1c", "title": "AITA for not allowing alcohol at my wedding & not telling people why?", "selftext": "I (28f) am marrying my fiance James (25m) in September. We sent the invites out in January and made no mention of the fact we won't be serving alcohol at the wedding, but we won't. We will only be serving non-alcoholic options and there won't be any available for people to people to buy at the 'bar'.\n\nI'm a recovering alcoholic (sober 4 years 7 months) but if I'm out socially and a discussion about having alcohol comes up, I always lie and tell people I'm seriously intolerant to alcohol and it makes me very sick. I just don't want people to know about my sobriety, it's none of their business. Only my best friends and immediate family know (and my fiance obviously).\n\nJames' birthday was in early April and we rented the room above a pub (yep, big fun for the recovering alcoholic as you can imagine..!) to celebrate. Convos about our wedding came up and I don't remember exactly how but I ended up talking to a group of not-so-close friends (more James' friends and my acquaintances) about the wedding. I said it was going to be an alcohol free wedding and they were pretty incredulous. Especially as James' birthday was not alcohol free. They asked why and I said I wasn't giving a reason, there's just no alcohol. They asked if I was pregnant, I said no. I just don't want alcohol at my wedding.\n\nI was called a buzzkill and told that people go to weddings to drink, that it's polite to put money behind the bar for your guests particularly if they are evening guests. It ended up in this big debate about drinking at weddings. One of our much closer friends joined the convo and asked why I didn't just tell them all why I don't drink. I said it was none of their business, pretty rudely to be honest but I was getting pissed off at this point. One of James' friends said being honest about it was the least I could do and it was wrong of me not to at least explain myself. One of them also made a fairly unpleasant joke at my expense basically suggesting I'm the 'ball and chain' now for James.\n\nI took myself out of the conversation because I was upset but I still don't think I owe anyone an explanation despite what they say. AITA?\n\nEdit: a few people have brought this up so I thought I'd address it. We didn't put it on the invites because BYOB isn't really a thing here with these kinds of venues, so we figured people won't (if they do I can't stop them drinking it but I'd rather they didn't) however if we put that it's a dry wedding more people will try and bring their own. And we because we've told the venue there's no alcohol, we have to pay a very steep corkage fee if people bring it and the venue staff notice. So we'd have to pay a considerable amount if someone was really obvious about it, and we all know drunk people aren't great at secrecy!\n\nEdit: all of my comments are being downvoted (so I guess I know how this judgement will go!) so I'm not sure if people will see my comment below on this, but I think I'm just going to mass email our guests telling the truth. It makes me feel awful to tell people I'm an alcoholic, but then I can say that it's a dry wedding and ask them not to bring alcohol, then the bandage is off and if they judge me they judge me. That's probably better than lying any more seeing as the lie never made much sense anyway", "created_utc": 1682608433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130qo1c/aita_for_not_allowing_alcohol_at_my_wedding_not/", "score": 3924, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couples getting married often make the mistake of thinking wittnessing their marriage is a good enough reason for people to spend hundreds of dollars and put aside an entire day (at least) for them alone.

You are absolutely entitled to have a dry wedding and I don\u2019t think that you owe anyone an explanation why (and the friends here were certainly being AHs about it), but you do need to let people know it will be dry. It\u2019s customary in most cultures to celebrate with alcohol at weddings, and purposely hiding that information from you guests is sneaky and deceitful. It straight up lying - purposely omitting information you know someone wants is lying. There\u2019s probably a portion of people who will be spending lots of money and time on you that would choose not to attend if there wasn\u2019t going to be alcohol. And really - at the end of the day, do you want a bunch of people to show up to your wedding surprised and then bummed and being buzz kills themselves when they find out there is no alcohol present? Whispering amongst themselves and staying off the dance floor? Leaving early? I think that\u2019s what will happen if you don\u2019t warn people. I think it\u2019s in your best interests to prepare people so they can adjust their attitudes before they get there, instead of being shocked and disappointed at your event.

Yes some people might try to sneak some in, but I highly doubt it would be a very big issue. Most people will respect a dry wedding if they\u2019re told ahead of time. Alcohol changes the circumstances of attending a wedding. I remember my fianc\u00e9 and I booked a hotel room for a wedding an hour away from our house so we could drink. If I showed up and it was a dry wedding, it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal, but it would be a little frustrating. I\u2019d be a little irritated, not because I NEED alcohol, but because it\u2019s safe to assume weddings will have alcohol and I planned accordingly. Typically you should put on the invitation if there is a deviation from the norm. It\u2019s like having a dress code but not telling people\u2026kind of unfair.

It\u2019s tough out there for us. \n\nWhere I am, it\u2019s 100% customary to serve alcohol at weddings, outside of those where the bride and groom and extended family are both very religiously observant. I\u2019ve had fun at both boozy and dry weddings.

I have no issue if James drinks, but I do not partake, and the reasons why are none of your damn business.\"\n\nHowever, that this is the big however...\n\nYTA for not specifying that this is a dry wedding on the invitation. The attendees have a right to know what they're getting into, and they have a right to know what the parameters are of the event they're being asked to attend. What behaviors are and are not allowed, what food options there are, the dress code, the location, the date, and *whether or not it will be dry*.\n\nYou may get people who refuse to come because of that, and you need to prepare yourself for that outcome. You may also have people who come to the wedding and then end up leaving *much* earlier than they would have, because they'd rather not sit around and drink soda and juice. Be prepared for that too. \n\nHave you worked with the venue to create a list of mocktails, or other types of fun NA drink options? There are so many ways to do dry events that are not \"we're not having booze but we're gonna hide that fact from everyone until they show up and hope it works out\". \n\nI'm not saying you have to provide anyone with reasons for your sobriety- that's your business. \n\nBut by lying about it for years, and then hiding the fact that your wedding is dry (which to your friends and family, has come across as lying), you've put yourself in a situation where all people are going to do is speculate and gossip about *why* you're sober and why there's no booze at the wedding. \n\nAt this point, I think you need to start running some damage control, and start by informing everyone who's invited that the wedding is 100% dry- and you completely understand if this information affects their RSVP. That you meant for it to be on the invites and in the hustle and bustle of wedding planning it got left off- but you wanted to make sure they got the information. \n\nCongrats on your sobriety so far, I know it's hard and each day can be tough.

So if people give you cash/ gifts based on the assumption that they'll be served alcohol and you intentionally don't tell them ahead of time, that's pretty tacky. \n\nAlso, do you have any out of town guests coming? If so, they're probably spending a lot of money on travel and accommodation, and that's on top of any gifts they give, plus any other costs associated with your wedding. So as the host, you really should reciprocate their generosity through ample food and drink or at the very least be clear from the jump that it's a dry wedding. \n\nSo yeah, absolutely have the wedding that you and your future spouse want but a simple heads up to your guests is going to save you a lot of headaches and possibly a lot of drama.", "If you had alcohol at the birthday party, why not at your wedding?

We sent the invites out in January and made no mention of the fact we won't be serving alcohol at the wedding, but we won't. We will only be serving non-alcoholic options and there won't be any available for people to people to buy at the 'bar'.\n\nI'm a recovering alcoholic (sober 4 years 7 months) but if I'm out socially and a discussion about having alcohol comes up, I always lie and tell people I'm seriously intolerant to alcohol and it makes me very sick. I just don't want people to know about my sobriety, it's none of their business. Only my best friends and immediate family know (and my fiance obviously).\n\nJames' birthday was in early April and we rented the room above a pub (yep, big fun for the recovering alcoholic as you can imagine..!) to celebrate. Convos about our wedding came up and I don't remember exactly how but I ended up talking to a group of not-so-close friends (more James' friends and my acquaintances) about the wedding. I said it was going to be an alcohol free wedding and they were pretty incredulous. Especially as James' birthday was not alcohol free. They asked why and I said I wasn't giving a reason, there's just no alcohol. They asked if I was pregnant, I said no. I just don't want alcohol at my wedding.\n\nI was called a buzzkill and told that people go to weddings to drink, that it's polite to put money behind the bar for your guests particularly if they are evening guests. It ended up in this big debate about drinking at weddings. One of our much closer friends joined the convo and asked why I didn't just tell them all why I don't drink. I said it was none of their business, pretty rudely to be honest but I was getting pissed off at this point. One of James' friends said being honest about it was the least I could do and it was wrong of me not to at least explain myself. One of them also made a fairly unpleasant joke at my expense basically suggesting I'm the 'ball and chain' now for James.\n\nI took myself out of the conversation because I was upset but I still don't think I owe anyone an explanation despite what they say.

We\u2019re so excited to share our upcoming nuptials with you and can\u2019t wait to party! But before we do, we have to share some exciting news with you. As of today, u/Ok_Cartographer_7439 is 4 years and 7 months sober! This is a huge feat and we want to make sure that our wedding day is a celebration of our love and our future. And so for this reason, we\u2019ve decided to not allow any alcohol at wedding. There will be non-alcoholic drinks available, and we request that guests avoid bringing their own, as our venue will not allow it. We understand that this is outside of cultural norms, but we promise that it will be an amazing time and hope that you\u2019ll all be there with your dancing shoes on. Love, James and OK\u201d\n\nAnd then you can have your best friends talk to the people you think are going to try to sneak it in and let them know exactly how much *they* are going to pay the venue if they get caught!", "There's no shame in being an alcoholic. A lot of the people you send this message to will be alcoholics; some in recovery, some trying to find the strength to start recovery, and some in denial. \n\nThe stories aren't landing because you know they aren't true and people can tell you are hiding something. It's understandable that you have feelings around your history. Those feelings don't need to control your life. It's ok to live openly and proudly in recovery. I encourage you to give it a try, and good luck!", "You can just say it's a dry wedding for personal reasons that are of no one's concern. Regardless of how others feel if you don't want to broadcast then don't. If you truly want to share let people know you recovered and prefer not to.", "Wow this feels like mass bullying. Don\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re a recovering alcoholic If that\u2019s not what you want to do.\n\nPeople can come to your wedding or not, they\u2019re should be no expectations on what they will be served, honestly. If they don\u2019t like what they see, no one is forcing them to stay.\n\nThe wedding day will pass and you will be left with a bunch of people who will criticize your reception no matter what, and the cherry on top is everyone now knows your business forever.", "You could just say that you don\u2019t drink in the mass email and that\u2019s why it\u2019ll be a dry wedding. No need to mention recovery and you can always share that information with people if it comes up later and you choose to. Plenty of people don\u2019t drink for lots of reasons and it\u2019s completely understandable for someone who doesn\u2019t drink to have a dry wedding", "If you're that set on not telling people about your sobriety then I don't see why you have to email and tell everyone that you're sober. Just email them that it's a dry wedding and apologize that it wasn't included on the invite...you don't owe people an explanation unless you think it'll help you get more guests to come and get more gifts or something?", "I would also revoke the invites of anyone that had a meltdown over not being able to drink at a wedding. I highly doubt they would respect your sobriety at your wedding", "You're lying to your friends and family...  YTA.

If I were to live to cultural norms I would be able to leave the house without a male relative according to the culture I grew up in. \n\nSome cultural norms are harmful, needing alcohol at every celebration is not healthy at all. And yes I live in a country where partying with alcohol is very much the standard. Hell, todays King\u2019s Day so there\u2019s people drinking in the streets, there was a lot of drinking last night. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not against it, I drink myself. I just don\u2019t expect alcohol at every event and I don\u2019t expect to be notified if there\u2019s not going to be alcohol. And I can go multiple events and celebrations without alcohol.\n\nNeeding a drug to be provided, or being able to bring said drug yourself or being able to buy said drug at the party or if none of that is possible at least be informed that said drug will not be available is so ridiculous to me.\n\nWhy is alcohol so prudent?", "It's not necessarily the OP that had the drinking problem. For me it was my inlaws and a few of my family. I was looking to avoid the inevitable drama. Think racist uncle at Thanksgiving level obnoxious behaviour.", "Even us alcoholics dont ban it from our weddings. Me and my husband are 8+ years, and the majority of my friends are sober as well with various lengths of time. We have never been to a dry wedding, even if both the bride and groom are in recovery. Reading this, my concern was more that she is trying to \"white-knuckle\" recovery. Its hard from just this post, but most people 4 years sober should have no problem being around alcohol. Sure, maybe if this was some kegger frat party but its a wedding, serve beer and wine (and sparkling cidar for us non-boozers)!\n\nFor more perspective, in my work environment, we go to happy hours multiple times a month. I host large parties with both my sober and work friends twice a year. I have even played some drinking games over the years. When I host, I have separate cups, everyone who can drink alcohol has to use a red cup, my sober friends use clear. So none of us accidentally pick up and drink something with alcohol in it.\n\nFrom my experience, I have said \"I dont drink\" and any follow up question gets solved by \"nah, I just dont drink\". People pushing the issue are the assholes but thats been like 2% of the people I have ever come across. Most people really dont care. And most people know someone who does/has suffered from addiction. AND most people find it inspiring.

I feel sad for everyone in this situation.", "I don't know if the default guess is one of the people getting married is an alcoholic. My first thought would be they couldn't afford it.

Those change in dynamics can be changed and still entertain guests.

If someone was not having alcohol, that\u2019s fine, but to not tell anyone when that\u2019s the norm, I\u2019d be really mad I didn\u2019t just drive or that I paid money for a hotel room.  It\u2019s reasonable to want to know this.", "> I guess I don\u2019t understand why you have to tell anyone that it\u2019s dry?\n\nBecause that way, people who will be angry that it\u2019s dry won\u2019t come and you\u2019ll save yourself the aggravation.", "I agree.   I\u2019ve been to several dry weddings, and it wasn\u2019t anywhere on the invite or wedding info.   It might have more to do with growing up in churches with a lot of church weddings, but it\u2019s not that abnormal to have dry weddings, even if the bride or groom drink and it\u2019s not a church wedding.

Cool, but expect that people won't like it.\n\nIn the case of OP, it would be MUCH worse if she didn't tell them in advance. I can see two things happening. One, the guests will leave as soon as possible. Second, this wedding will be topic of family gossip for decades.

It's usually culturally acceptable to drink at a wedding. If me and my spouse are traveling some amount of time, possibly staying overnight, hiring a babysitter for the kids, dressing up in our nicest clothes, and attending a celebration it is NOT a problem to want/expect a couple of alcoholic drinks throughout the evening.  \n  \nThe fact so many responses to these questions are \"if you can't go one night without a drink you have a problem\" is fundamentally ridiculous due to the amount of effort that goes into planning to attend a wedding it is not \"one night\" it is a very special occasion under very special circumstances under which it is culturally expected that alcohol will be served.", "If you think someone has a problem because they\u2019re mad they wasted money on a hotel room and/or a taxi when the wedding is dry and they could have driven themselves, it sounds like you\u2019re the one with issues. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Sure, but it's a them problem if they want that specific guest.

No problem if she doesn't want to pay for it, totally understandable but she really does need to let her guests know. Maybe she still has some issues with her sobriety she needs to address.", "Agreed. It's kind of disturbing how many people seem to get so upset about the possibility of there being no booze.", "Right? Like I\u2019m going to a wedding to celebrate my loved ones getting married, I don\u2019t care what else is or isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019ve also been to quite a few weddings where I didn\u2019t drink at all despite there being alcohol (I\u2019m generally not a big drinker) and still had a blast.\n\nI find it kind of sad when people *need* alcohol to have fun.", "No, it's not.\n\nIt's the problem of the couple who thinks that being rebel is cool.", "I think you nailed it with saying it depends on who it is. If you\u2019re not going to your best friends wedding an hour away because you can\u2019t drink, you\u2019re just an asshole lol.\n\nBut if it\u2019s someone you sort of knew from college and you\u2019d have to buy a flight/hotel to get there *and* you found out that there wouldn\u2019t be alcohol, then it becomes more understandable.", "You barely get to spend any time with the couple on the day.

The reception is a party you throw FOR your guests and OP needs to be honest with herself about guests' expectations. You cannot have a dry wedding and follow the basic wedding flow of events of ceremony -> cocktail hour -> dinner -> speeches -> dancing, when that flow is designed with drinking in mind. A nice brunch wedding where you have a ceremony at 10 and then brunch and speeches and then everyone can disperse by 2PM is much more reasonable if you are having a dry wedding.

No, it\u2019s not their business\u2026 except it kind of is, because you invited them and they assumed it would be a normal wedding with alcohol. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want all the flack just tell the truth. There is nothing wrong to be recovering and you should be INCREDIBLY PROUD of all your hard work. I bet your fianc\u00e9 is!", "YTA. Next to New Year's Eve, drinking at a wedding is the most socially accepted place to drink. Everyone else shouldn't drink because you can't? Don't have a reception. Take the money and get married abroad while on the honeymoon vacation. Send photos back to your friends. They can look at them while having a drink.", "I wonder how many would be angry because they made plans to get home, rented a hotel, got overnight babysitters, or paid for a cab because they planned on drinking just to find out they could have driven themselves and didn't need a nearby room for the night", "Agreed. Booze is a part of the appeal to sitting around strangers mostly and I need motivation to get out on the dance floor.", "That\u2019s my exact thought - if they had put it on the invite people would RSVP no but maybe they are hoping if they show up to no booze they\u2019ll just stay because they\u2019re already there.", "Right but people would be hungry if you didn\u2019t provide them food and thirsty if you didn\u2019t provide them drink. What\u2019s going to happen if you don\u2019t provide them alcohol? Nothing.", "OP is providing food and drink, just not alcohol.", "They\u2019re providing drinks, just not alcoholic ones. I imaging mocktails, ginger beer and cider, etc", "I'm going to a wedding this weekend. I am spending $200 on a hotel room and $150 on a babysitter.\n\n\nIf I got there and it was dry I have wasted all that money. That's a dick move to do to your guests.", "I've been to one. It was decidedly 'meh'. The reception lasted all of maybe 1.5 hours before everyone split and went to the local dance-hall.", "It's so easy to tell when people are just allergic to having a good time. The chemical reaction of consuming alcohol is not fun in a vacuum. I don't want to \"go to a bar to drink whenever I want\", I want to celebrate with people using a substance that exists for celebration's sake.", "Something doesn\u2019t have to be shameful to be private.", "I agree 100%, it is bullying.  OP's reasons for having a dry wedding are her own and she does not have to share them with anyone.", "Thank you! People act like alcohol is akin to food water and shelter. I get that it\u2019s the norm to provide alcohol but there are people who don\u2019t drink. I feel like people demanding them have alcohol is like someone going to a wedding for two vegans and being angry that there\u2019s no meat option. \n\nYes you want your guests to enjoy themselves but ultimately the day is for you. The only reason I think you should put in the invite it\u2019s a dry wedding is to sort out the people who are actually coming to celebrate your day from those just looking to get drunk.", "I have seen that where the bride and groom have said we have people who are close to us that recovering alcoholics and we are doing this to support them.", "You\u2019re pathetic if alcohol being available is a deciding factor in attending a wedding. I should hope your cousins don\u2019t bother inviting you at all since you clearly don\u2019t care about them, just beer.", "Same! I've been to one wedding with an open bar. I was at a backyard wedding where there was some bar. I've been to some 100% dry weddings and some with a glass of champagne. Alcohol is not expected in my area in my social circle.", "Nope, that's just you projecting your own weakness onto others.", "I'm the total opposite when I get asked why I don't drink a lot I'm a very occasional drinker I have no problem saying my mum was an alcholic and there have been times I've could see myself going down the same path", "~~It's at a pub.~~\n\nThat was the birthday, my bad", "Or I only know the bride and groom and they\u2019re busy, and if you want me to socialize with your great aunt I\u2019ve never met and dance with your random relatives I\u2019m gonna want a glass of wine.", "Oh yeah me now would just very casually say \"alcoholic father\" and keep the conversation moving or choose to let the awkward silence make the other person reconsider why they asked to begin with\n\nMe in college wasn't aware of having had any trauma, wasn't ready to admit to himself that his father was an alcoholic/felt a lot of shame about that, and felt more susceptible to peer pressure in general. But I'm very very grateful to him for recognizing on some level that his habits/personality/unconscious trauma responses/whatever you want to call it wouldn't pair well with alcohol. I pretty clearly knew I needed to choose between no relationship w alcohol vs a problematic relationship and I chose the former", "No, the birthday party was at a pub. The wedding is at a different location.", "I love this sub will throw words out like trauma and it\u2019s your (body, kid, wedding, house) your choice. Unless op isn\u2019t comfortable about alcohol. I don\u2019t want to hear any arguments on why context is different it\u2019s hypocritical. Ppl like weddings to get smashed and op\nDoesn\u2019t want to deal with it!", "It\u2019s just understood to sneak your own at ours", "NTA it's your wedding not their free kegger", "Dude, no. Some people here are acting deranged. Disclose it's going to be a dry wedding if you think it's necessary, but there's absolutely no need to disclose personal information like that if you're not comfortable. None.", "You don't even need to say you're in recovery. Just say you're sober. I have plenty of friends who are sober for lots of reasons (medications, health issues, dislike of alcohol, or just general health). \n\nSaying you're sober doesn't give people intimate details of your life. And you don't have to answer questions about it. \n\nBut lying about it, evading the question, and hiding that it's going to be a dry wedding WILL cause way more questions and speculations. \n\nI don't know why you're attaching shame to this. \"I'm sober, so this will be a dry wedding. Please don't try to sneak alcohol in, because we will be charged a XXX corkage fee if the venue staff find we have brought alcohol in.\" \n\nI'd suggest setting a hard end time for the wedding, and letting people go out afterwards and even suggesting some places. \"Fiance and I will be doing our departure at 10pm, if guests would like to hit up the local pub after that!\" \n\nPlease realize that people WILL leave early. If you're expecting to have dancing and such, I wouldn't. Have dinner, dessert, a first dance, toasts, and end an earlish time.", "Honestly people can infer why it's a dry wedding, a generic \"I'm asking everyone to please keep my wedding dry\" is enough for people to understand there's a good reason.", "Honestly this might be a good opportunity to also cut the shitty people out. I mean anyone that bullies you over it or sneaks alcohol in despite your request can fuck right off. But still, if you don't feel safe telling them please don't. You can just throw in the \"personal reasons\" card.", "Ah idk if you\u2019ll see this at this point but NTA \n\nidk\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like you HAVE to tell people about your sobriety in order to notify everyone about there being no alcohol. The way it\u2019s hurting you to have to grapple with telling people hurts my heart. \n\nIt could be something along the lines of \u201cthe nature of why there won\u2019t be alcohol is due to *very* intimate and personal reasons that i don\u2019t comfortable discussing, and it would be very hurtful to me if people were to try to dig or pry beyond that. But please know that I love and appreciate everyone willing to support me with this. I thank you all for the love and hope you can understand my wishes\u201d. and even go the distance of apologizing for not being upfront due to your anxieties around the situation. I feel like that softens the blow and makes you appear as less of the \u201cbad guy\u201d (which you aren\u2019t btw!)", "Don't feel pressured by people here to tell your history if you're not ready. You should probably mass email and inform everyone that it'll be a dry wedding, that's just the right thing to do. Maybe apologize for not clarifying that on the invitation. \n\nBut your personal business is yours alone. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and you shouldn't feel forced into sharing your story before you're ready.", "You absolutely do not need to disclose your private medical information to your guests. You can give them a heads-up about the dry wedding, but your sobriety is your business. Yeah, they\u2019ll speculate, but that\u2019s on them.", "Hi OP, your reasons for the dry wedding are your own and you do not owe anyone an explanation.  Ever.\n\nHowever, I do think (since apparently loads of people go to weddings expecting alcohol) that you should inform your guests that it is a dry wedding. How you do this is up to you.  If it is a smaller wedding, word of mouth should suffice.\n\nYou are NTA.", "Please dont feel pressured to tell people you're in recovery if you're not comfortable with that yet. I do think it's wise to send an email that it is a dry wedding, given it is a cultural expectation, so that people can manage their expectations and plans accordingly. NTA, and congratulations on your marriage and 4y 7m of recovery \u2764", "I don\u2019t think you need to explain your decision to have a dry wedding. I think it would be a good idea to tell people though. Obviously, alcohol is a big part of the celebration in many cultures. I would let people know, about that part. They don\u2019t need to know why. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s awkward for you. \nYou may end up with a smaller reception, but you\u2019re getting married! That\u2019s the important part of the day! And maintaining your sobriety is important too.", "Going against the grain, I don't feel that you need to be specific in WHY it's a dry wedding. If you're comfortable telling people your circumstances, that's one thing. I feel a lot of the AH votes are coming from the lack of awareness that you've planned a dry event. People hate surprises.\n\n\nFor what it's worth, definitely NTA for having an event that suits you and your future spouse. I would recommend an email to all guests (BCC them) to the effect \"We wanted to ensure all guests are aware that we are planning on a \"dry\" reception due to sensitive family circumstances. There will be no alcohol served or available to purchase, and we appreciate you not bringing any alcohol to the venue. We are grateful for your love, support and discretion, and can't wait to celebrate this once in a lifetime event with you all\"", "OP, just know it\u2019s not your fault/problem or anything. It\u2019s absurd that people need to be informed that they won\u2019t be getting alcohol. And it\u2019s absurd that if you state that it\u2019s a dry wedding, people will just sneak in alcohol themselves. The culture around alcohol is highly problematic and that\u2019s not on you!", "I've been to weddings that ended up being dry, but like... if you know your friends and they never drink, why would you expect an open bar? I was shocked at one wedding I went to recently (mentioned in a comment) where the couple, who does not drink alcohol at all (they did their toast with their personal fave bevvies, chocolate milk and Monster) had wine on the table. No one had expected that. \n\nI used to brush it off, but now I am starting to see it more as a lot of people can't \"celebrate\" or \"party\" without booze and it's kind of weird. Said as someone who enjoys a nice gin fizz, whiskey sour or a good beer but could also just as soon have lemonade.", "It\u2019s a wedding. A celebration. Not just a night without alcohol. People expect it. And weddings are stressful for everyone. No one likes them, minus the occasional person. You go to support people. Weddings are long. Boring. You have to talk with people you don\u2019t like. All night. The food stinks. If the cake is fondant, you\u2019re screwed there too. Alcohol is about the only good thing at a wedding.", "I only drink for social occasions, definitely don't have a drinking problem but I do have social anxiety and if I don't have 1 or 2 drinks to relax and get out of my head the experience is just dreadful. I'd rather know ahead so I can throw back a shot before I get there or just don't bother coming since I know it wont be fun and i'll be uncomfortable the whole time anyway", "Also all the comments along these lines keep getting down voted because apparently supporting people making the best decisions for their health isn't okay if it means taking the fun drink away for one night. I drink a bit more frequently than you and still think most of this comment section is a bundle of red flags flapping in the wind.", "She's entitled to her privacy. Her personal struggles are hers, and she should be able to decide who she shares these very intimate details with.\n\nThat could potentially ruin her image and  professional career.", "have you ever drank before?  \npeople will get unnecessary hotels & taxis & babysitters because drinking requires planning.  \nintroverts & outer circle guests like myself would probably rather decline because socializing with new people is exhausting, & drinking deadens the anxiety.  \nweddings just aren\u2019t that fun for everyone. speeches are boring. people will leave early.  \nno one needs to know why, but people will absolutely be pissed if they weren\u2019t informed it would be dry.", "If you have to ask the question then yes, I absolutely need to not be sober in order to enjoy your company.", "Free?\n\nMy friends are not as rich as yours lmao.", "Absolutely this. Within 90 minutes you'd have lost 3/4 of your guests to family emergencies, babysitter problems, or other excuses only to find them all 2 miles down the road at the local boozer. Even the wedding party would be eagerly eyeing the earliest appropriate time to leave, or at least dip back to their rooms to neck a bottle of wine each.\n\nSure as shit not gonna have anyone dancing and socialising with the 100 people they barely know.", "How about someone you have *some* connection with, maybe having a wedding in a place you'd want to visit. Maybe you know 15 other people going, so it can be a great reunion. Not everyone is a best friend, not everyone is a worst enemy.", "I had Baptist relatives so I had never been to one with alcohol and my wedding was a nightmare keeping my family away from his.", "My mom's family is Southern Baptist so every wedding I've been to on their side has been dry.", "Exactly. They said \u201cpeople go to wedding to drink.\u201d If that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to the wedding then you\u2019re a shitty friend or family member.", "Actually it might the autism + the fact I only turned old enough to drink this year - I genuinely don\u2019t understand most (social) things I probably should. It\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to work on to the best of my abilities currently.\n\nRegardless, thank you for your comment. This does help understand a little better. I still don\u2019t understand how a wedding with booze would be easier to pull off than without booze entirely, but again that may be because my personal experience with pretty much everyone in my life who drinks it has been a negative. \n\nAsking this because I\u2019m genuinely clueless about it; is alcohol then expected at all \u201cmajor\u201d social gatherings (adult birthdays, holidays, etc.) or are weddings the only ones?"]}
