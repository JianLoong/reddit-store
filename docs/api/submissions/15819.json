{"id": 15819, "submission_id": "130qo1c", "title": "AITA for not allowing alcohol at my wedding & not telling people why?", "selftext": "I (28f) am marrying my fiance James (25m) in September. We sent the invites out in January and made no mention of the fact we won't be serving alcohol at the wedding, but we won't. We will only be serving non-alcoholic options and there won't be any available for people to people to buy at the 'bar'.\n\nI'm a recovering alcoholic (sober 4 years 7 months) but if I'm out socially and a discussion about having alcohol comes up, I always lie and tell people I'm seriously intolerant to alcohol and it makes me very sick. I just don't want people to know about my sobriety, it's none of their business. Only my best friends and immediate family know (and my fiance obviously).\n\nJames' birthday was in early April and we rented the room above a pub (yep, big fun for the recovering alcoholic as you can imagine..!) to celebrate. Convos about our wedding came up and I don't remember exactly how but I ended up talking to a group of not-so-close friends (more James' friends and my acquaintances) about the wedding. I said it was going to be an alcohol free wedding and they were pretty incredulous. Especially as James' birthday was not alcohol free. They asked why and I said I wasn't giving a reason, there's just no alcohol. They asked if I was pregnant, I said no. I just don't want alcohol at my wedding.\n\nI was called a buzzkill and told that people go to weddings to drink, that it's polite to put money behind the bar for your guests particularly if they are evening guests. It ended up in this big debate about drinking at weddings. One of our much closer friends joined the convo and asked why I didn't just tell them all why I don't drink. I said it was none of their business, pretty rudely to be honest but I was getting pissed off at this point. One of James' friends said being honest about it was the least I could do and it was wrong of me not to at least explain myself. One of them also made a fairly unpleasant joke at my expense basically suggesting I'm the 'ball and chain' now for James.\n\nI took myself out of the conversation because I was upset but I still don't think I owe anyone an explanation despite what they say. AITA?\n\nEdit: a few people have brought this up so I thought I'd address it. We didn't put it on the invites because BYOB isn't really a thing here with these kinds of venues, so we figured people won't (if they do I can't stop them drinking it but I'd rather they didn't) however if we put that it's a dry wedding more people will try and bring their own. And we because we've told the venue there's no alcohol, we have to pay a very steep corkage fee if people bring it and the venue staff notice. So we'd have to pay a considerable amount if someone was really obvious about it, and we all know drunk people aren't great at secrecy!\n\nEdit: all of my comments are being downvoted (so I guess I know how this judgement will go!) so I'm not sure if people will see my comment below on this, but I think I'm just going to mass email our guests telling the truth. It makes me feel awful to tell people I'm an alcoholic, but then I can say that it's a dry wedding and ask them not to bring alcohol, then the bandage is off and if they judge me they judge me. That's probably better than lying any more seeing as the lie never made much sense anyway", "created_utc": 1682608433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130qo1c/aita_for_not_allowing_alcohol_at_my_wedding_not/", "score": 563, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couples getting married often make the mistake of thinking wittnessing their marriage is a good enough reason for people to spend hundreds of dollars and put aside an entire day (at least) for them alone.

You are absolutely entitled to have a dry wedding and I don\u2019t think that you owe anyone an explanation why (and the friends here were certainly being AHs about it), but you do need to let people know it will be dry. It\u2019s customary in most cultures to celebrate with alcohol at weddings, and purposely hiding that information from you guests is sneaky and deceitful. It straight up lying - purposely omitting information you know someone wants is lying. There\u2019s probably a portion of people who will be spending lots of money and time on you that would choose not to attend if there wasn\u2019t going to be alcohol. And really - at the end of the day, do you want a bunch of people to show up to your wedding surprised and then bummed and being buzz kills themselves when they find out there is no alcohol present? Whispering amongst themselves and staying off the dance floor? Leaving early? I think that\u2019s what will happen if you don\u2019t warn people. I think it\u2019s in your best interests to prepare people so they can adjust their attitudes before they get there, instead of being shocked and disappointed at your event.

Yes some people might try to sneak some in, but I highly doubt it would be a very big issue. Most people will respect a dry wedding if they\u2019re told ahead of time. Alcohol changes the circumstances of attending a wedding. I remember my fianc\u00e9 and I booked a hotel room for a wedding an hour away from our house so we could drink. If I showed up and it was a dry wedding, it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal, but it would be a little frustrating. I\u2019d be a little irritated, not because I NEED alcohol, but because it\u2019s safe to assume weddings will have alcohol and I planned accordingly. Typically you should put on the invitation if there is a deviation from the norm. It\u2019s like having a dress code but not telling people\u2026kind of unfair.

It\u2019s tough out there for us. \n\nWhere I am, it\u2019s 100% customary to serve alcohol at weddings, outside of those where the bride and groom and extended family are both very religiously observant. I\u2019ve had fun at both boozy and dry weddings.

It sucks that, as someone in recovery, you have to make this call. But weddings are as much about your guests as you.

I have no issue if James drinks, but I do not partake, and the reasons why are none of your damn business.\"\n\nHowever, that this is the big however...\n\nYTA for not specifying that this is a dry wedding on the invitation. The attendees have a right to know what they're getting into, and they have a right to know what the parameters are of the event they're being asked to attend. What behaviors are and are not allowed, what food options there are, the dress code, the location, the date, and *whether or not it will be dry*.\n\nYou may get people who refuse to come because of that, and you need to prepare yourself for that outcome. You may also have people who come to the wedding and then end up leaving *much* earlier than they would have, because they'd rather not sit around and drink soda and juice. Be prepared for that too. \n\nHave you worked with the venue to create a list of mocktails, or other types of fun NA drink options? There are so many ways to do dry events that are not \"we're not having booze but we're gonna hide that fact from everyone until they show up and hope it works out\". \n\nI'm not saying you have to provide anyone with reasons for your sobriety- that's your business. \n\nBut by lying about it for years, and then hiding the fact that your wedding is dry (which to your friends and family, has come across as lying), you've put yourself in a situation where all people are going to do is speculate and gossip about *why* you're sober and why there's no booze at the wedding. \n\nAt this point, I think you need to start running some damage control, and start by informing everyone who's invited that the wedding is 100% dry- and you completely understand if this information affects their RSVP. That you meant for it to be on the invites and in the hustle and bustle of wedding planning it got left off- but you wanted to make sure they got the information. \n\nCongrats on your sobriety so far, I know it's hard and each day can be tough.

So if people give you cash/ gifts based on the assumption that they'll be served alcohol and you intentionally don't tell them ahead of time, that's pretty tacky. \n\nAlso, do you have any out of town guests coming? If so, they're probably spending a lot of money on travel and accommodation, and that's on top of any gifts they give, plus any other costs associated with your wedding. So as the host, you really should reciprocate their generosity through ample food and drink or at the very least be clear from the jump that it's a dry wedding. \n\nSo yeah, absolutely have the wedding that you and your future spouse want but a simple heads up to your guests is going to save you a lot of headaches and possibly a lot of drama.", "If you had alcohol at the birthday party, why not at your wedding?

We sent the invites out in January and made no mention of the fact we won't be serving alcohol at the wedding, but we won't. We will only be serving non-alcoholic options and there won't be any available for people to people to buy at the 'bar'.\n\nI'm a recovering alcoholic (sober 4 years 7 months) but if I'm out socially and a discussion about having alcohol comes up, I always lie and tell people I'm seriously intolerant to alcohol and it makes me very sick. I just don't want people to know about my sobriety, it's none of their business. Only my best friends and immediate family know (and my fiance obviously).\n\nJames' birthday was in early April and we rented the room above a pub (yep, big fun for the recovering alcoholic as you can imagine..!) to celebrate. Convos about our wedding came up and I don't remember exactly how but I ended up talking to a group of not-so-close friends (more James' friends and my acquaintances) about the wedding. I said it was going to be an alcohol free wedding and they were pretty incredulous. Especially as James' birthday was not alcohol free. They asked why and I said I wasn't giving a reason, there's just no alcohol. They asked if I was pregnant, I said no. I just don't want alcohol at my wedding.\n\nI was called a buzzkill and told that people go to weddings to drink, that it's polite to put money behind the bar for your guests particularly if they are evening guests. It ended up in this big debate about drinking at weddings. One of our much closer friends joined the convo and asked why I didn't just tell them all why I don't drink. I said it was none of their business, pretty rudely to be honest but I was getting pissed off at this point. One of James' friends said being honest about it was the least I could do and it was wrong of me not to at least explain myself. One of them also made a fairly unpleasant joke at my expense basically suggesting I'm the 'ball and chain' now for James.\n\nI took myself out of the conversation because I was upset but I still don't think I owe anyone an explanation despite what they say.

Addiction is so so hard to overcome, be proud of yourself for making it out and keeping up wit your sobriety! I find 99% of people are extremely supportive and understanding. If they aren\u2019t you don\u2019t need them in your life.", "Yup. Also ignoring that hosting dinner (or an all-day event) it's a cultural norm in much of the West to provide Drink as well as food, and assuming that everyone gets wasted the second alcohol touches their lips.

The polite thing to do is to tell them. If you don't, you will absolutely get many unhappy / pissed off comments and you will upset quite a few people. I only drink a couple of times a month, and even I'd be pretty annoyed. None of this will happen if you just tell them in advance. You need to explain that BYOB is not allowed, too. It will be fine. People should understand (if they don't, then that's a completely different story), but they need to know. Not on the day of, after they get there and spend all this money planning on not driving after the reception.\n\nThis isn't because all of these people can't go a night without drinking. I'm surprised at the lack of critical thinking in many of these comments. It's the expectation and money spent in preparation, not the alcohol itself.", "I don\u2019t think making security check people is something a venue would automatically include. They would have to pay for this themselves.", "Bingo!. People plan to go to a wedding assuming there is alcohol...in tangible and often times expensive ways. Not because they are alcoholics (like many comments seem to think) but because most weddings are a fun party with alcohol.", "Did I say anywhere that you're required to get your guests wasted or get wasted ourselves? Even when we've done dry months/alcohol free dieting, we have a bottle of wine on the table and beers in the fridge if we have people over for dinner.\n\nEven the ritual of making someone a cocktail or mocktail can be a huge icebreaker imo.", "No most normal adults at least where I come from would turn up expecting to have a drink at a wedding, and then go \"oh fucking hell\" when they found out it's a dry wedding without being informed.", "Nope. It\u2019s normal for adults to drink at events. If you think that having a glass of wine is \u201cnumbing your mind\u201d or that people not wanting to go to a boring as fuck dry wedding means they can\u2019t go without a drink it sounds like you\u2019re the one with issues.", "Lol, WTF kind of judgmental BS is this? I've been to many a party, many weddings and no one has ever gotten sloppy drunk. No one. This isn't an exaggeration.\n\nI'm sorry you haven't had the same experience, but some of us know how much to drink.", "It's a CELEBRATION, not an every day thing and thus not a problem. Jeez, could you be any more moralistic?", "Exactly, the hiding it is the poor move. Hell, most people (including me) get upset if they show up at a wedding and weren\u2019t pre warned that it\u2019s a cash bar. I can\u2019t imagine how annoying it would be to show up and not be told there\u2019s no alcohol at all. It\u2019s just common courtesy to give people a heads up.", "No Midwest \nBut even the not dry ones haven\u2019t been explicitly alcohol friendly.

That\u2019s a given.  \n\nAlcohol isn\u2019t a necessity to have a reception.  You\u2019re not going to get sick or develop a medical problem if you can\u2019t drink.  If you do, then you might need to talk to someone about that.  \n\nIf you\u2019re down to party and ready to get tipsy, then go out after the reception.", "getting angry that there is no alcohol *does* indicate alcoholism.", "Yes, I've felt it, and no, I don't rely on alcohol to make through it. May I suggest therapy?", "They said *requiring* booze to loosen up means you have a problem.", "If you NEED alcohol, you have a problem.", "If I showed up to a wedding and security asked to check my bag I would straight up turn around and leave.

So you're literally admitting you can't attend a wedding without wanting alcohol and will be so bored to tears celebrating a friend or family's wedding and their love for each other sober. \ud83d\udc4d Look who has \"issues\" being sober literally in their own writing!\n\nAnd also it's not \"normal for adults to drink at events\". Unless you're young or just over 21, where drinking is cool and --hey guys!! look at me, I'm an adult who can drink alcohol--\ud83d\ude44 Or older and think having a drink is a must, or are an alcoholic.", "I don't know anyone who would stop at A glass of wine.\n\nWorse if difference between boring and not boring is the alcohol you might want to seek AA.", "I've been to one wedding in the last 5 years where anyone got sloppy drunk. The couple was younger than average for the other weddings I attended and they and their wedding party were the only sloppy ones. Party was about them and no one got belligerent, so no one else cared. If they regret it these days, that's a them problem but the rest of us has a pretty good time regardless. \n\nOnce upon a time, I thought people getting constantly, violently drunk at every major function was normal. These days, I know that's not the case. I honestly think most adults have a pretty safe relationship with alcohol, but having a few drinks during a party that lasts 4-6 hours is pretty standard. I'd still attend a dry wedding, but I'm not staying long and I'd be pissed if one were sprung on me. Not because I'm getting drunk, but because the glass of wine at dinner gets the social juices flowing in a way water doesn't and another on the dance floor makes ignoring how bad my shoes pinch easier.  Charging the social battery requires a completely different type of preparation when alcohol will not be present.", "Can't you celebrate without booze once?", "I didn\u2019t say it was a necessity, I just think it would be considerate to let people know for planning. But you clearly are feeling self-righteous about alcohol and ignoring my actual point.", "Wow how many ladders did it take for you to get up on that high horse?", "But....\"loosening up\" is precisely NOT a normal thing for most people, which is why booze helps with it! Trust me, I wish I was the kind of person who could effortlessly socialize with strangers and have fun on a dance floor without a bit of social lubrication. But my \"problem\" is social anxiety, not alcoholism.", "Great, I will add it to my list of \" problems\".", "that's a you thing - and that's totally valid for you! but it's not the norm.", "If you don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019d stop at one glass of wine, you may be surrounded by people who have issues with alcohol.

There\u2019s also plenty of adults with healthy relationships with alcohol who enjoy indulging themselves at special events like weddings. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You\u2019re projecting like crazy.", "> I don't know anyone who would stop at A glass of wine.\n\n\nWell, \"that says more about you (and the people that you hang out with) than anything\".", "Well that says more about your friends and family and their inability to stop at one glass, than other people drinking.", "I don't drink. But yes, celebration includes booze, if not for me but for the others, because I'm not selfish to have things cater to me.\n\nCelebrations include booze for millemnia!", "I\u2019m actually not self righteous about alcohol.  I enjoy drinking and love a good cocktail.  I understood your point about the planning aspect, and I don\u2019t completely disagree with it.  That being said, what\u2019s stopping you from using the Uber and going out afterward?", "Then you should deal with your social anxiety instead of using alcohol to fix it.", "Problems you'll work on you mean? Or just problems and let them be there?", "\"it's not the norm\" I have been to plenty of events and hosted events without alcohol with no complaints. It is common yes, normal, no. So it's a you thing that drinks automatically means alcohol.", "That in itself might be an indicator of a greater problem in social interaction of society in general", "I had a single pint of beer with a coworker yesterday afternoon.

Plenty of adults have drank. Plenty know people that can't stop at one. They also recognize that those individuals have a bad relationship with alcohol. That doesn't change their own ability to self-moderate.", "Comparing a seder to a wedding is gross and also a complete non-sequitur. A seder is NOT a \"celebration\". While it may be fun, those four glasses of wine aren't part of the holiday dinner, they're literally part of the religious ritual, or \"seder\", before and after the meal, and each one has religious meaning.    \n\n\nAlso, it is not religiously required that you have wine at seder in the way it is at Purim, for the sake of the alcohol; you can use grape juice or any other juice of a \"fruit of the vine\" over which you can make the \"Borei Pri Ha'etz\" blessing and the kiddush. So your argument doesn't even hold up on the face of it.\n\nI'm not sure why you'd even bring this up here but it's a massive red herring. If you're going to compare this to anything, compare it to a Jewish wedding, but even then you can make kiddush and all the blessings over grape juice and there is neither reason nor proscription against having a dry wedding in Judaism. \n\nDude, this is Reddit. Don't bring up unrelated subjects and assume that other people aren't going to know at least as much about them as you.", "Alcohol isn't medication or therapy.
