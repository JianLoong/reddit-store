My stepsister was 1 at the time. My mom's parents and extended family were still part of my life after my mom died when I was 6 and they babysat me a lot for my dad and they'd take me places (water park, amusement park, picnics, etc). I never wanted my stepsister to join in. Honestly even though she's a sibling through marriage I still consider myself an only child and don't really have strong feelings about her either way. She's fine. I don't hate being around her but I don't want her around more either.\n\nBut my dad got this idea years ago that I loved her and considered her my little sister and wanted to be this awesome big brother who gave her more family. So he asked my grandparents to take her sometimes because I wanted that. They spoke to me and said they would if I wanted them to but they wanted to hear it from me. I was honest with them. Dad got the idea I cared more than I do and that I want her around more than I actually do. That it was all him. They said that was fine.\n\nDad was really upset with them for that and tried to pull me back from them but I spoke up and when that wasn't enough, I told him I would make his life miserable if he took my family from me. He gave in. Though sometimes he would bring up that he had asked my grandparents again. Not sure how many times. I kinda lost count.\n\nAround 2 years ago my stepsister started asking to come along for visits to my grandparents. She has none in her life (some by choice and some by death) and really wanted to tag along. I also think she bonded with me more than I did her so she wanted more time with me. She was upset when it didn't happen.\n\nThen my stepsister's birthday happened. She sent an invite to all my family to come to her party. None of them came. She was devastated and my dad went crazy on my grandparents and told them they were shitty for rejecting the most important person in my life, the little sister I adored and chose. They told him that if she had been important to me, they would have included her, but she wasn't and they didn't force it because they didn't want to adopt his stepchild as a grandchild. My dad confronted me and asked what the hell was going on. I told him I never actually said I wanted my stepsister to join OR that she was my sister or important to me. I told him he put the words into my mouth. He was the one who declared us brother and sister. He was the one who claimed I loved her when I have never said that I do. I told him I never cared all that much. He was the one who made it seem like I did. My dad exploded because he said I let them all believe I love her and see her as my sister and that it was childish to say I never wanted her to be included sometimes.

That he just came up with that all on his own. The reason I feel like what I said to him, as well as the parts about not really caring, is I know she cares, that she loves me, that she thinks of me as some amazing older brother and she'd be crushed by how I feel. Simple fact is now that I have said this stuff out loud it has a better chance of getting back to her. I also know my dad maybe feels guilty because she was so little when he married her mom and probably feels like he should have ensured I felt differently than I do about her and I never really tried to change how I feel.

That, alone, is probably more than enough to have a ten year old unhappy - who wants to be woken up by a toddler's nightmares regularly?\n\nAnd all the other changes.  The old child's favorite foods will not be in the meal rotation as often, with more people's tastes to account for in the family.  New foods, which the older child will find unfamiliar, and may not even like, will be added to the mix.

This has led to confusion, so that your father was deceived into believing that not rejecting her to her face meant that you welcomed her.  You are willing  to explicitly state that you do not want her presence, even in front of her, to avoid deceiving your father in the future.\n\nWhen arrangements were made that she would visit your grandparents, you refrained from objecting, because doing so in front of a young child would be cruel.

Of course it may not be a happy ending instantly but maybe after many conversations, they will all arrive at a solution/setup that works best for everyone and is considerate of everyone's feelings in the matter.  \n\n\nDad is definitely wrong and maybe straight up delusional to assume and impose that they are all one big happy family immediately after the marriage.

Dad pushed his delusion into his son but that doesn't mean it can't still be fixed. The maternal grandparents maybe the only people OP ever talked about his feelings with and not dad. They could've pushed for a conversation between the two or maybe talked with dad themselves in a calm manner.  \n\n\nAll I'm saying that dad is the A in this and OP is certainly a victim of his dad's decisions, but the most innocent victim in their family issues is the 6 year old child. The 6 year old who was a baby when her mom got married so she definitely couldn't get a word out about it, the little girl who has no grandparents at all (as OP said) and grew up with someone she called \"big brother\" who doesn't even consider her a sister.   \n\n\nOP obviously has an issue with his father remarrying and dad painting this happy family picture for him. Maternal grandparents have an issue with dad trying to force this stepchild into their family. Everyone in this scenario has an issue with DAD's decisions.

Its the 6 year old child nobody in that family obviously wants because she's not related by blood.  \n\n\nIt was 1 birthday party the grandparents were invited to, not by the dad, but by the little girl.

Because its a kid's birthday party. A child. An innocent child. Will their world crumble if they would've just attended the party and set aside their differences? This is not about them being family or not but being a decent human being to a child who invited you.  \n\n\nOP is very lucky to have such wonderful grandparents that were there for him.

About how you've really felt for the last 6 years. You're worried that what you might say may piss him off more, but you already have plans to leave in 2 years. So why not just say it? Say everything that you've left unsaid ever since he re-married. But please talk to each other calmly.

The adopted child is chosen by the parents, the older child has no choice in the matter.  The older child can be expected to be a polite housemate, but their feelings cannot be demanded to change to be what the parents want on a particular timeline. \n\nEven for siblings by birth, there often isn't as much feelings of closeness for older kids who suddenly wind up with a baby sibling in the house, compared to those where the sibling is born when they are young.  A ten year old and a one year old are never going to have the closeness of children nearer the same age.  They'll have vastly different levels of maturity, very different age-appropriate interests, and entirely different experiences of growing up as an only child until nearly adolescence, versus always having a sibling there.
