My stepsister was 1 at the time. My mom's parents and extended family were still part of my life after my mom died when I was 6 and they babysat me a lot for my dad and they'd take me places (water park, amusement park, picnics, etc). I never wanted my stepsister to join in. Honestly even though she's a sibling through marriage I still consider myself an only child and don't really have strong feelings about her either way. She's fine. I don't hate being around her but I don't want her around more either.\n\nBut my dad got this idea years ago that I loved her and considered her my little sister and wanted to be this awesome big brother who gave her more family. So he asked my grandparents to take her sometimes because I wanted that. They spoke to me and said they would if I wanted them to but they wanted to hear it from me. I was honest with them. Dad got the idea I cared more than I do and that I want her around more than I actually do. That it was all him. They said that was fine.\n\nDad was really upset with them for that and tried to pull me back from them but I spoke up and when that wasn't enough, I told him I would make his life miserable if he took my family from me. He gave in. Though sometimes he would bring up that he had asked my grandparents again. Not sure how many times. I kinda lost count.\n\nAround 2 years ago my stepsister started asking to come along for visits to my grandparents. She has none in her life (some by choice and some by death) and really wanted to tag along. I also think she bonded with me more than I did her so she wanted more time with me. She was upset when it didn't happen.\n\nThen my stepsister's birthday happened. She sent an invite to all my family to come to her party. None of them came. She was devastated and my dad went crazy on my grandparents and told them they were shitty for rejecting the most important person in my life, the little sister I adored and chose. They told him that if she had been important to me, they would have included her, but she wasn't and they didn't force it because they didn't want to adopt his stepchild as a grandchild. My dad confronted me and asked what the hell was going on. I told him I never actually said I wanted my stepsister to join OR that she was my sister or important to me. I told him he put the words into my mouth. He was the one who declared us brother and sister. He was the one who claimed I loved her when I have never said that I do. I told him I never cared all that much. He was the one who made it seem like I did. My dad exploded because he said I let them all believe I love her and see her as my sister and that it was childish to say I never wanted her to be included sometimes.

That he just came up with that all on his own. The reason I feel like what I said to him, as well as the parts about not really caring, is I know she cares, that she loves me, that she thinks of me as some amazing older brother and she'd be crushed by how I feel. Simple fact is now that I have said this stuff out loud it has a better chance of getting back to her. I also know my dad maybe feels guilty because she was so little when he married her mom and probably feels like he should have ensured I felt differently than I do about her and I never really tried to change how I feel.

That, alone, is probably more than enough to have a ten year old unhappy - who wants to be woken up by a toddler's nightmares regularly?\n\nAnd all the other changes.  The old child's favorite foods will not be in the meal rotation as often, with more people's tastes to account for in the family.  New foods, which the older child will find unfamiliar, and may not even like, will be added to the mix.

It sounds as if both you, and your father, could use some space.\n\nYou might try writing a letter where you \"admit\" what you did wrong.\n\nHe's upset that you \"deceived\" him into thinking you considered your stepsister your sister.  So, you've worked to discover what led to the deception, and will try to fix it!\n\nYou have been consistently polite to your stepsister, which has been mistaken for affection.  In order to avoid deceiving him, you are willing to stop being polite to her, so as to not give a false impression.\n\nYou have made a point not to reject your stepsister to her face, as doing so to a young child would be cruel.  This has led to confusion, so that your father was deceived into believing that not rejecting her to her face meant that you welcomed her.  You are willing  to explicitly state that you do not want her presence, even in front of her, to avoid deceiving your father in the future.\n\nWhen arrangements were made that she would visit your grandparents, you refrained from objecting, because doing so in front of a young child would be cruel.  This deceived your father into believing that you welcomed her as a sister, and your grandparents welcomed her as a grandchild.  To avoid future deception, you will object whenever anyone tries to plan anything that involves her with you and your grandparents. \n\nIn other words;\n\n\"I have tried to be a decent and polite housemate, despite never choosing to have a stepmother or stepsister.  Now, it seems that this effort is not appreciated, but rather seen as me being deceptive.  I will try to be more honest and transparent about these circumstances in the future, to avoid inadvertently continuing to deceive anyone.\" \n\nWell, that letter bit was perhaps a bit snarkier than is wise.  But it does make the point that if your father will treat good behavior as deceptive, the only honest option is bad behavior, and I don't think he's thought that through.", "Exactly. Them not going was a fuckyou to dad. But was it dad that was affected? It was the girl - who has absolutely no idea what the hell is going on.   \n\n\nMy point is obviously the adults and OP in this situation are those with issues with each other but sadly, the victims in these are the children. As the adults in this scenario, they should've acted civil enough for scenarios like this.", "Yeah that\u2019s why he\u2019s the AH", "Yes, these are definitely the things he and his father need to have a conversation about, now that though he may still be a kid, he's much older and much more mature (compared to when he was 10) to have a talk with his dad about this. I just feel like the tension between him, his father, his maternal grandparents and his stepsister can be resolved. Of course it may not be a happy ending instantly but maybe after many conversations, they will all arrive at a solution/setup that works best for everyone and is considerate of everyone's feelings in the matter.  \n\n\nDad is definitely wrong and maybe straight up delusional to assume and impose that they are all one big happy family immediately after the marriage. He did it for good reasons, but he imposed it on his son. We all don't know the full story here and the entirety of OPs experience the past 16 years, but one thing I'm thing I'm sure of is they definitely need to talk about this.", "Two of those three aren't family to OP either by blood or choice, only by marriage. OP is under no obligation to consider them family.", "Which is exactly what I was curious about. Because OP's mom died when he was 6. Dad married after 4 years when he was 10.  He is now 16 years old. He has been living with his \"not-family\" for 6 years.  \n\n\nI am not saying that OP should welcome them with open arms and pretend that they are the most important people in his life. I have been pushing for him to have a conversation with his dad about what he is actually feeling about this whole thing for the past 6 years.  \n\n\nI agree with ya'll that he is NTA here but dad. Dad pushed his delusion into his son but that doesn't mean it can't still be fixed. The maternal grandparents maybe the only people OP ever talked about his feelings with and not dad. They could've pushed for a conversation between the two or maybe talked with dad themselves in a calm manner.  \n\n\nAll I'm saying that dad is the A in this and OP is certainly a victim of his dad's decisions, but the most innocent victim in their family issues is the 6 year old child. The 6 year old who was a baby when her mom got married so she definitely couldn't get a word out about it, the little girl who has no grandparents at all (as OP said) and grew up with someone she called \"big brother\" who doesn't even consider her a sister.   \n\n\nOP obviously has an issue with his father remarrying and dad painting this happy family picture for him. Maternal grandparents have an issue with dad trying to force this stepchild into their family. Everyone in this scenario has an issue with DAD's decisions. But is the person being affected greatly the dad? No its not. Its the 6 year old child nobody in that family obviously wants because she's not related by blood.  \n\n\nIt was 1 birthday party the grandparents were invited to, not by the dad, but by the little girl. She may have been forced to write those invitations by dad, we don't know, but still, the invites was sent by this little 6 year old girl. And none of them showed up because \"she's not family.\"  \n\n\nEveryday we see stuff on the internet by the kindness of strangers, the common stories where no one shows up to the kid's party because of whatever reason and random strangers would show up, why? Because its a kid's birthday party. A child. An innocent child. Will their world crumble if they would've just attended the party and set aside their differences? This is not about them being family or not but being a decent human being to a child who invited you.  \n\n\nOP is very lucky to have such wonderful grandparents that were there for him. He cherishes them most because they were there when he lost his mom at age 6. Well guess what, his \"not-sister\" is also age 6 now - with no grandparents and a \"not-brother\" that wants nothing to do with her.   \n\n\nAll I'm saying OP is, talk to your dad. About how you've really felt for the last 6 years. You're worried that what you might say may piss him off more, but you already have plans to leave in 2 years. So why not just say it? Say everything that you've left unsaid ever since he re-married. But please talk to each other calmly. This conversation is supposed to be between you and your father and nobody else.", "Yeah, dad has problems.\n\nBut I do think that it needs to be very clear that there is absolutely nothing wrong with OP, just because he hasn't come to love someone who happens to be the child of the person OP's dad fell in love with and married.  OP doesn't have \"issues\" for failing to love someone on demand.\n\nAnd treating OP as if there is something wrong with him because he values his memory of his mother, and his mother's parents, above his stepmother and stepsister, would be a very wrong thing to do.\n\nAnd if the father's acceptance and happiness are depending on OP playing Happy Family whether he wants to or not, it isn't OP rejecting the father if he doesn't do so, it is the father rejecting OP unless OP performs emotions on demand.\n\nI do wonder how OP's mother is remembered and honored in OP's home.  Are there pictures of OP's mother displayed, pictures of OP with his mother, pictures of OP with both his mother and father?  Is that part of OP's life talked about freely and openly?  Can OP ask his father if he has any questions about his mother?  Are OP's memories and feelings for his mother honored and cherished?\n\nOr does the house look as if OP sprang into existence when the father married the stepmother, without reminders of OP's mother, and OP's relationship with her, held in honor?\n\nIf OP were  to get a large picture of himself and his mother from his grandparents, nicely framed, would he be welcome to hang it in the living room or dining room, for all to see?", "Yeah, I agree that OP is NTA hahaha I've said in my earlier comment. The children in this situation, OP included, is clearly victims of how OP's dad decided and acted on all of these. They really to have a conversation though. It will be a tough one, but they need to coz it seems like they never really did talk about this stuff in depth.", "NTA\n\nMay I ask if your grandparents and co are wealthy?\n\nIt seems to me, that not only you \"have to love\"  her, but your relatives too....", "ESH. Poor little girl.", ">told them they were shitty for rejecting the most important person in my life, the little sister I adored and chose\n\nThat's weird as hell. Your dad seems to think he has reality warping powers. I know this was partly a I want free babysitting but that's delusional. NTA.", "NTA!\n\nYour mother's parents owe that child nothing.\n\nINFO: Why aren't his parents or his wife's parents involved?", "NTA, but your father is.\n\nWorse, no matter how often you tell him you don't care about her, he keeps repeating his lies that you're a doting big brother, etc.\n\nYou have got to get out of that house as soon as possible. And then you can cut him off as his reward for trying to cast you in a false role and then  blaming you for it instead of himself.\n\nBut he knew what he was doing all along.", "Free babysitting.", "He knows he messed up. He is just too coward to accept the blame. He misled the child about your love for her and he doesn't want to take the responsibility. I am sad for your step siter though. How do you say to the kid that her stepfather has lied to her all these years or at the very least told her wishful thinking crap.", "I\u2019m sorry\u2014 massive YTA. Not for telling the truth, but there\u2019s a SIX YEAR OLD who loves you and wants to spend time with you and wants to see grandparents sometimes and your whole family is being cruel to her for no reason? Jeez, dude. That\u2019s a child. You\u2019re 16. Big enough to realize the vulnerability of a 6 year old. To me, you\u2019re absolutely acting like an asshole.", "ESH.\n\nWhen my cousin married a woman with two kids, his parents IMMEDIATELY treated those kids  the same as all the other grandchildren. My cousin and his wife had two more kids.  The step-kids dad's PARENTS treated the two later kids (no relation to them) the same as the first two, since they were all in the same household. My mom's best friend has half-grandchildren, step-grandchildren, you name it.  \n\nDid you even TRY to bond with this little girl?  Do you have any empathy at all, or are you just self-centered?\n\nI grew up with no grandparents, since they all died fairly young.  My cousins' grandparents told us to consider them our grandparents, too.  \n\nThe CRUELTY of your grandparents, who wouldn't even come to a little girls' birthday party.", "NTA He wanted free childcare and an occasional weekend off with the wife and wanted to lay it on you. He's mad you stopped him from going golfing and prevented intimate time on his projected date weekends with the wife. That was his fantasy and not your fault that you didn't buy into it.", "NTA. Also, you as a child definitely didn't 'choose' to have a step sister. You had no say in the matter. So why he implied you love her dearly and she's the most important person in your life that you love and chose is ridiculous. You had no say in the situation. \n\nNTA. Your dad sounds like he was trying to palm off your step sister to your grandparents to have some child free time with his wife, bit it's totally not appropriate to force that on grandparents who have no tie to the child, and want to spend quality time with you...their deceased daughters son. \n\nSome grandparents do take on step kids but it's a personal choice. Some do, and some don't. It's not an obligation. And it's usually if their own child had remarried someone with a child. Not their son in laws remarried someone with a child. \n\nJust because step sister doesn't have any grandparents in her live, (one set deceased and the other set not involved by choice) doesn't mean the inlaws have to become her grandparents. \n\nIt's good you treat your step sister kindly and respectful etc, and don't treat her unkindly, but you don't have to be close and love her deeply just because your dad married her mum. You're doing right by treating her nice and kind and respectfully, because she's done nothing to deserve ill treatment, but you shouldn't be forced into building a deep loving bond with her just because your dad has built this fantasy in his head, or because he's trying to palm her off with you to the grandparents for child free time.", "NTA. Your dad never asked you or had an honest conversation with you about her/you relationship. He assumed & it\u2019s the worst thing a parent can ever do, is to assume.  Perhaps opening that conversation would be a good idea after all these years of his assuming. You are also entitled to your own feelings about who you want in your life and if she doesn\u2019t fit the bill, so be it.", "So, love and family connection is a limited thing.  Love can expand to include others, without taking a THING away from OP.", "OP is 9 years older than his sister. Yes, his SISTER because they were raised together in the same house. Plenty of people, myself included, have full bio-siblings with a bigger age gap between them, so I absolutely do not buy the excuse that they're \"just too far apart\" or he has a \"decade of memories without her.\" 10 is a child. 1 is practically a baby. OP was there for all of her growing up and she's been there for a huge chunk of his. \n\nI agree that the dad has blinders on and has been blissfully imagining a happy family that isn't real, but OP's callous disregard of his sister's feelings (is he seriously not at all concerned that his sister is crying because people she thought cared about her and considered her family refused to show up to her birthday and it's his fault?) leaps off the page. \n\nIf OP's dad had not remarried, but had instead adopted a 1 year old, would anyone be entertaining this \"not my sister and I shouldn't have to act like I care about her\" BS for a second?", "Right, he\u2019s the classic \u2018force my kid and step kid to be bffs\u2019 step parent. And it never works, cause no shit forcing a relationship just breeds resentment.\n\nI feel so sorry for that little girl, dad has clearly built up the idea of the grandparents and family to her and got her hopes up and they\u2019re ruined. That\u2019s not on OP or their family, it\u2019s all on the shitty dad. He\u2019s probably doing it to manipulate Op into including her and then getting angry at OP when it\u2019s actually his fault.", "Exactly, that poor little girl is so upset now and it\u2019s all dad\u2019s fault, even though he\u2019s blaming OP.", "What does him not \"healing\" have to do with being indifferent towards a 6 year old?", "Time, resources and attention are very much a limited thing, and if OP wants time with his dead mother's family and not have to bring his father's stepdaughter along, that's entirely within his rights. \n\nOP, NTA.

We do not automatically have the same connections to the people that \u201cour\u201d people love. To say that it should be like that is forced and artificial.\n\nMeanwhile, since OP doesn\u2019t live with his grandparents, his time with them IS limited, and he wants to spend it in a specific way, without having his stepsister around.  They also clearly are not interested in spending time with her (and justifiably don\u2019t think it\u2019s their role to include her since OP is not interested in having her with them and they otherwise have no connection to her).  \n\nYou\u2019re making it seem like this love would have naturally occurred anyway but the only way it really could have been fostered is if OP was forced to take his stepsister with him to a space that he viewed as scared and safe.", "Nahhhh, father sounds deluded. \n\n4 years (at most) OPs dad found a new wife, and the way it sounds to me, essentially picked up where he left off.

She obviously doesn't know the truth and I think it might be better for her emotional well being, if she rather hates you than love you when that love is obviously not returned at all.
