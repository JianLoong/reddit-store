My stepsister was 1 at the time. My mom's parents and extended family were still part of my life after my mom died when I was 6 and they babysat me a lot for my dad and they'd take me places (water park, amusement park, picnics, etc). I never wanted my stepsister to join in. Honestly even though she's a sibling through marriage I still consider myself an only child and don't really have strong feelings about her either way. She's fine. I don't hate being around her but I don't want her around more either.\n\nBut my dad got this idea years ago that I loved her and considered her my little sister and wanted to be this awesome big brother who gave her more family. So he asked my grandparents to take her sometimes because I wanted that. They spoke to me and said they would if I wanted them to but they wanted to hear it from me. I was honest with them. Dad got the idea I cared more than I do and that I want her around more than I actually do. That it was all him. They said that was fine.\n\nDad was really upset with them for that and tried to pull me back from them but I spoke up and when that wasn't enough, I told him I would make his life miserable if he took my family from me. He gave in. Though sometimes he would bring up that he had asked my grandparents again. Not sure how many times. I kinda lost count.\n\nAround 2 years ago my stepsister started asking to come along for visits to my grandparents. She has none in her life (some by choice and some by death) and really wanted to tag along. I also think she bonded with me more than I did her so she wanted more time with me. She was upset when it didn't happen.\n\nThen my stepsister's birthday happened. She sent an invite to all my family to come to her party. None of them came. She was devastated and my dad went crazy on my grandparents and told them they were shitty for rejecting the most important person in my life, the little sister I adored and chose. They told him that if she had been important to me, they would have included her, but she wasn't and they didn't force it because they didn't want to adopt his stepchild as a grandchild. My dad confronted me and asked what the hell was going on. I told him I never actually said I wanted my stepsister to join OR that she was my sister or important to me. I told him he put the words into my mouth. He was the one who declared us brother and sister. He was the one who claimed I loved her when I have never said that I do. I told him I never cared all that much. He was the one who made it seem like I did. My dad exploded because he said I let them all believe I love her and see her as my sister and that it was childish to say I never wanted her to be included sometimes. I pointed out I never led anyone on. I have never played a caring big brother and never went out of my way to spend time with my stepsister, so how could anyone think I felt the way he claimed.\n\nHe said he couldn't look at me.

That he just came up with that all on his own. The reason I feel like what I said to him, as well as the parts about not really caring, is I know she cares, that she loves me, that she thinks of me as some amazing older brother and she'd be crushed by how I feel. Simple fact is now that I have said this stuff out loud it has a better chance of getting back to her. I also know my dad maybe feels guilty because she was so little when he married her mom and probably feels like he should have ensured I felt differently than I do about her and I never really tried to change how I feel.

But the kids generally didn't meet the step-family until much later than the parents did, and the kids didn't get to choose that the families would blend, that they'd have to live with these people, etc.\n\nA one year old isn't even old enough to be sleeping through the night.  That, alone, is probably more than enough to have a ten year old unhappy - who wants to be woken up by a toddler's nightmares regularly?\n\nAnd all the other changes.  The old child's favorite foods will not be in the meal rotation as often, with more people's tastes to account for in the family.  New foods, which the older child will find unfamiliar, and may not even like, will be added to the mix.  Weekends that were 1:1 with their parent, doing activities together, now involve others, and may be vastly unsuited to an older child's interests (how much of what is suitable for 1 year old is interesting to a 10 year old?)\n\nThe stepsister is, obviously, not family by blood.\n\nShe also clearly isn't family by choice - OP, like any child, did not get to choose who his father would marry, or whether that person would bring children into the household.  \n\nWhich leaves what?  Family by default?  Imposed by the decisions of others, without consideration of your feelings?  \n\nTurn the situation around.  Would either adult accept it if a child told their single parent \"I want this person to be my new mother/father, so you have to marry them and we'll all live together, whether you like it or not!\"  \n\nOf course not! \n\nBut adults expect children to accept, as family, people chosen by their parents without the child having any controlling say in how the situation develops or who it involves. \n\n\"Why haven't you conformed your feelings to what your parent wants your feelings to be, yet?\" is a kind of ridiculous question.\n\nThe child's feelings are their own, and there is no timeline on which the child needs to be expected to start feeling what the parent wants them to feel.\n\nA parent can expect good manners, and general behavior around the household that shows that the child is making an age-appropriate attempt to be a polite housemate.
