{"id": 10975, "submission_id": "11cn9sp", "title": "AITA for not listening to my SIL's request for a child-free party?", "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here, and I will keep it as short as I can. \n\nI am extremely close to a cousin, and he is the closest to a sibling in my life, myself not having any sibling. So naturally, when he got married, I was super excited to welcome a sister in my life. My SIL is, however, not as excited as I was, and I get that. So the first time I got a cold vibe from her, I stepped back and apologized to her for overwhelming her. This happened a year back, and after this incident, we hardly met up a few times, and each time, we were civil. SIL is, at best, aloof from our family, and my cousin thinks that is because she comes from a completely different background, and her family was not as large as ours. I am not sure if it is necessary to mention this, but we are a South-Asian family (myself and cousin belonging to the 2nd generation), and SIL is White.\n\nWe later came to know that SIL does not like kids. Our family has a lot of them (my kids, as well as kids of other cousins), which is why she gets overwhelmed. So she started coming to our get-togethers less often, and we get that. She was always invited, but she would politely decline every time. \n\nComing to  the main topic, my cousin will have to relocate  to a different continent for a year and wanted to visit me once before leaving. He offered to come over to our place with SIL. I told him that they were always welcome. But SIL informed me that she wants to visit just us, and she doesn't want to be with the kids (I have 2, 5F and 2M). She just wants us adults. I offered that we could go out for dinner. She refused and told me that she wanted to drink and let loose. I told her that if she wants to come over to our place, then she is always welcome, but the kids will stay. I told them that the kids go to sleep by 7:30, and we can catch up after that. She refused to that as well. She wants us to keep the kids at some friend's house (we have many in the neighborhood). I told her 1) that I am not comfortable with keeping such young kids away for the night, and 2) this is our house, meaning the kids' house as well, and that she is the guest. So we get to decide if the kids stay or not. Now SIL thinks I am a huge dick  for refusing just one night of fun.\n\nAITA here? Should I have just listened to her?\n\nEDITS:\n\n1) Wow! Thank you, kind strangers, for all the comments. And thank you, not just for the NTAs, but simply for caring. I went through the comments and I felt I have not specified a few things; so I will try and add all the info here.\n\n2) Cousin and SIL are married. It was a court marriage, both of them did not want a big one.\n\n3) So I did not mention that my cousin was not there during  the conversation. After this short fiasco, I did not get the time to speak to him. But I did tell my parents as I was upset. Not sure what happened there, but hopefully I will know soon.\n\n4) Someone mentioned that I might not like SIL. I will not say that I dislike her, because, frankly, she has not done anything till then to be disliked. She was quiet, but she was civil. And after a couple of gatherings, she stopped visiting completely. So I would say I am indifferent toward her.\n\n5) My cousin had always made it clear that he does not want a child. So they were definitely on the same page in this case. \n\n6) I apologize if anyone is offended by the cultural point I have mentioned. I definitely did not mean that this is common with the White people. I apologize if anyone felt that way. I meant that since the elders in our family are first-generation immigrants, and are actually pretty different in their way of thinking than us, she might have felt awkward with them. \n\nEDITS NO. 2:\n\nNobody has mentioned his, but I still wanted to let you know that I am totally pro childfree events. Or I am and will always stand by someone who decides not to have a child. These are completely personal decisions, and I respect them. I have seen marriages fall apart because of one incorrect decision of having children when the couples were not ready. I know how serious a decision this is. I fully support people who do not want to have children, and I also think it is completely fine to dislike children altogether. A personal choice that I fully respect. \n\nI hope I have covered everything. I will read the comments further and check if anything else needs to be added.", "created_utc": 1677432889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cn9sp/aita_for_not_listening_to_my_sils_request_for_a/", "score": 1943, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one should have to make accommodations for me - if I want to see my friends who have kids I either see the kids too or plan something that is inherently childfree like a bar night (and like you suggested). It sounds like you offered her a million options and she was just being difficult - and makes most of us normal childfree people look bad.", "NTA. She married a South Asian when she hates kids? Your cousin is about to lose his entire family over time. We plan everything based on the comfort of the kids in attendance. Wedding dates are based on when it\u2019s not the exam season.", "NTA \n\nIt is ok to be childfree. It is ok to dislike being around children. It is even ok to avoid children. It is not ok to kick children out of their own homes because you don't want them existing in the same house as you.", "NTA\n\nThis is your children\u2019s home. She wants to kick them out of their own home when they would be in bed asleep anyway. It\u2019s a power move to get you to pick her over your own kids.", "NTA\n\nI also don\u2019t like kids, but I understand that seeing parent friends means I have to be flexible about when/where we meet so that we can hang out without the kids around. SIL is an asshole for not accepting either of your reasonable offers (restaurant, or after bedtime).\n\nI will note that after bedtime is not a great idea. I did this with parent-friends a few times and the kids always heard us talking and wanted to get out of bed to join us, or somehow knew something was up and wouldn\u2019t go to bed on time. But the restaurant (kids with a sitter) would have been a great idea.", "I don\u2019t get people who say they don\u2019t like kids. Did they hate themselves for first 18 years of their lives and suddenly liked themselves when they were eligible to vote?", "I'm childfree too but I could never imagine asking my friends who have kids to send them away when I was visiting. They're just around, I just don't want to deal with them 24/7 for 18 years. Different strokes, different folks.", "Do you really want such people in your house? I don\u2019t have kids or any chance of having one but if there was someone who hated my family members so much so that they won\u2019t even look at them I would definitely not let them into my household.", "This right here, was what I thought too.. from the title. But the audacity of anyone, let alone \u201cfamily\u201d telling OP to send their kids somewhere so they can \u201cparty\u201d is what I can\u2019t get over. My parents had adult guests over when my siblings and I were little, we were in our rooms, playing or sleeping. What\u2019s she plan on doing during her \u201cparty\u201d? Absolutely NTA", "I hope you never ever serve on a jury, because you make snap judgements based on half a story.", "NTA\nYour SIL sounds very exhausting", "NTA. She needs to get a grip. She will encounter many kids throughout her life", "NTA she sounds controlling af", "NTA you don\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s house and try to make them kick out their children", "[removed]", "NTA. \n\n>I told her 1) that I am not comfortable with keeping such young kids away for the night, and 2) this is our house, meaning the kids' house as well, and that she is the guest. So we get to decide if the kids stay or not.\n\nBasically for this. Who does she think she is? How can she think that demanding that children leave their house just for her is reasonable? You offered different options, she rejected all of them. She can stay home.", "NTA. It's your house.\n\nBut I will say, as a childfree person myself, that I think she is feeling excluded.\n\nI cannot handle being around noisy children because they trigger my misophonia. I also have ASD which causes me to become overwhelmed and rapidly exhausted when kids have no concept of physical boundaries. The presence of kids makes it impossible for me to have a good time. If most of the get-togethers in my family involved kids even when they didn't need to, I would feel like no one cared enough to ensure I wasn't the odd one out and constantly on the outside looking in.\n\nFor whatever reason, she finds the presence of kids extremely off-putting, and her comment at the end there makes it sound like you guys involve the kids in most things which effectively puts up a barrier between her and the rest of the adults in your family.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Is she an alcoholic? I get wanting to be child free, and in their own home and for their own event, they are absolutely free to make them child free. However when she demands that your home is child free, then she is way out of line, and you have to wonder why it\u2019s so important for her to binge drink. NTA", "IMHO, her outlandish statements can mean two things: she\u2019s either unbalanced, or she wants to tell her husband: \u201cSee how your family disrespects me, and does not care for me wishes?\u201d In order to distance him from the rest of the family.", "NTA. My read on this is that SIL doesn\u2019t actually want to visit you, and this is her passive aggressive way of getting out of it.", "Am I the only one who thinks the SIL is emotionally abusive and this is part of her strategy to isolate him from his family? I can't imagine marrying someone and immediately being cold to his closest family members.", "My jaw hit the floor. The audacity of trying to kick the kids out of their own home so she can get loudly shitfaced? Excuse me? Unbelievable. It is THEIR HOME.", "This!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "I believe people who *hate* kids have unresolved childhood trauma. Wanting to be childfree is one thing. *Hating* children is another.", "That's one possible scenario, but I don't know if there's actual evidence of alienation from OP's post.\n\nAlternative scenario: her SIL is just highly immature and blinkered about her no-kids policy, not willing to acknowledge that she can't enforce her no-kids rule as a house guest. It is very odd behaviour for sure.", "Same. People who actively hate children usually have a history of their own childhood trauma that\u2019s unresolved. So they unfairly project it onto kids.", "And then, when faced with new evidence as they read along, a lot of people who made initial judgments changed them.  That's an open mind and sounds good for a jury to me.  It's the people who can't change their mind that are the problem imo."]}
