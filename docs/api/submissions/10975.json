So naturally, when he got married, I was super excited to welcome a sister in my life. My SIL is, however, not as excited as I was, and I get that. So the first time I got a cold vibe from her, I stepped back and apologized to her for overwhelming her. This happened a year back, and after this incident, we hardly met up a few times, and each time, we were civil. SIL is, at best, aloof from our family, and my cousin thinks that is because she comes from a completely different background, and her family was not as large as ours. I am not sure if it is necessary to mention this, but we are a South-Asian family (myself and cousin belonging to the 2nd generation), and SIL is White.\n\nWe later came to know that SIL does not like kids. Our family has a lot of them (my kids, as well as kids of other cousins), which is why she gets overwhelmed. So she started coming to our get-togethers less often, and we get that. She was always invited, but she would politely decline every time. \n\nComing to  the main topic, my cousin will have to relocate  to a different continent for a year and wanted to visit me once before leaving. He offered to come over to our place with SIL. I told him that they were always welcome. But SIL informed me that she wants to visit just us, and she doesn't want to be with the kids (I have 2, 5F and 2M). She just wants us adults. I offered that we could go out for dinner. She refused and told me that she wanted to drink and let loose. I told her that if she wants to come over to our place, then she is always welcome, but the kids will stay. I told them that the kids go to sleep by 7:30, and we can catch up after that. She refused to that as well. She wants us to keep the kids at some friend's house (we have many in the neighborhood). I told her 1) that I am not comfortable with keeping such young kids away for the night, and 2) this is our house, meaning the kids' house as well, and that she is the guest. So we get to decide if the kids stay or not. Now SIL thinks I am a huge dick  for refusing just one night of fun.\n\nAITA here?

She can just deal with the fact that you have children and they're permitted to be present in their own home, or she can sit this one out and stay home herself.", "Damn now kids can't even be in their own house? Next level anti kid, haven't seen this before. NTA.", "NTA you give 2 great options of going out or starting after bedtime. Like how wasted does she want to get!?!", "NTA, she wants to \"drink and let loose\" she should do this out, with company that is able to do so; not expect you to find a way to get rid of a baby for the night so you can offer your house for it.", "NTA. Where was this lady raised? In a cave by a she-wolf? This is so ridiculous , I am beginning to think she needs professional help.", "I'm childfree, and Even I wouldn't have pulled this crap at someone else's house. \n\nNTA", "NTA your SIL is out of her gourd and might have a drinking problem.", "NTA. How dense do you have to be to kick little kids out of their own home. So you can drink and let loose\ud83d\ude29", "NTA. \u201cSure SIL, I\u2019ll just put little Jimmy out on the street while you come in here and let loose\u201d. Where the heck are you supposed to stash your kids?!", "What? You\u2019ve posted on this forum like 10 times today with fake stories. Get outta here.", "Nta it's your house your home your children your family. You need to have boundaries with her. People like that I don't trust. I wouldn't stand for someone telling me my children have to be removed from my home so someone that's not even real family is happy. Your cousin is going to have so many problems and issues.  I don't see the relationship lasting at all.", "NTA.  Who expects that?  I can't imagine going to someone else's house and expecting them to house their kids elsewhere, or pets, or making any sort of similar request.  I don't think it's a culture thing.  I think it's an entitled AH thing.  OP is NTA.", "NTA.  She does not get to kick your kids out of their own house.  I get not liking kids, but the inability to even tolerate being around children is a not healthy, and it will seriously damage her relationship with the rest of the family and with larger society in general.", "NTA. I have 3 kids and was fully prepared to say YTA because you shouldn\u2019t impose your kids on anyone, but she wants to come to your house, where the kids live, and have them just not be there? Even after bedtime? That\u2019s super weird.", "NTA some entitlement there, thinking she can send someone else's kids out of their own home.", "Nope NTA\n\nI am child-free and can get overwhelmed by kids too. But the audacity to say, \"I want to come to your house but you need to get rid of your kids when I do\" is astounding. She needs to grow-up and at least learn how to manage a couple hours around kids.", "NTA. I've had a lot of people try to justify why they don't like children and are somehow not misanthropes with a personality disorder, but one excuse that'll never get any traction is \"I want to get drunk and potentially behave in a way that's inappropriate around children.\"   \n\n\nYour sister-in-law wants to party with someone who doesn't exist, namely you-but-without-children-or-family-you-love-around-you. You aren't obligated to invent that person so your SIL can get drunk with them.", "NTA. How incredibly entitled or she has some sort of phobia regarding kids. Your poor cousin.", "Soft NTA because it IS the kids' house as well, and you are clearly love your kids a lot and want them with you.  \n\n\nBut...  \n\n\nI get the feeling you don't like SIL because she doesn't like kids and because she doesn't want to be your sister.  And because you're close to your cousin that you consider him a brother, it makes you upset.  And you probably want your cousin/brother to be involved uncle with your kids, and it's not going as you want because his wife has no interest.  Might even be disappointed that they won't have kids, so they, too, can have a close cousin relationship.  \n\n\nBy the way, saying the kids would be asleep by 7:30 is also likely wrong.  Oh, you'd try.  But do kids easily go to bed when Things are Happening?  Or do they fight to stay out with Uncle and Everyone and...   And what happens in the half-hour to hour while you're trying to put them to bed?", " I get it, some people don\u2019t like kids, but to have the audacity to say they have to leave their house so she can drink and let loose is mind boggling to me! \n\nWhen I first read the title I was think Y T A because I figured you brought them to her party when they weren\u2019t invited. But nope, your (kids) house\u2026yeah\u2026NTA", "NTA\n\nI find it really wierd and concerning how much she doesnt like kids. Like some people dont like kids which is fine but to not even want them in the vicinity of your existence is pretty weird", "NTA\nYou offered reasonable solutions, she responded with pretty extreme requests. It's fair that not everyone likes kids, but she is acting like they are some kind of contamination.", "NTA. For heaven's sake, it's your children's own home! Your offer to take your cousin and SIL out to dinner sans children was more than thoughtful and fair - and if your SIL needs to drink more than is appropriate at a restaurant in order to have fun, well, that's her problem (and perhaps your cousin's problem) and not yours. But no one has the right to demand that a parent farm their children out from the family home for even an evening because the demander wants to party hearty.", "NTA\nYou have your priorities right.", "NTA, ... I might tjeck any abuse or sex-offenders registry available.", "SIL is crazy to think that she can tell you guys to move your kids out of their home so she can feel comfortable. I wouldn\u2019t even hang out with her anymore. I\u2019m sorry your probably gonna have issues with your cousin because of this but this is truly ridiculous of her.", "NTA", "\" Put your hamster in the cage as long as I'm here \". That's what this sounds like.  NTA. She's entitled delusional and rude. It's amazing how such people find parters when they're clearly not ready for marriage. Since when does being white stop you from being polite and reasonable ? Her race or background has nothing to do with this. The audacity to tell someone to keep their kids away from their own he as if they're vermin.  Her ass shouldn't be invited to anything anymore.", "NTA and it was weird of her to ask. If she wants a child free party, she should host.", "Absolutely NTA. And honestly, your cousin and his wife really don\u2019t seem truly compatible in my opinion. She has no business trying to dictate whether or not your children are in *their home* when they come to visit. You were more than gracious in my opinion and handled it better than I probably would\u2019ve.", "Unrealistic demands, no compromise, no compassion.\n\nNTA.", "Nta, you are being a great mom, obviously. I\u2019m white and married into a wonderful south-Asian family- going on 25 years. They are totally accepting and supportive, always. Your SIL is an entitled brat/ I\u2019m sorry your cousin picked her- his support of her doesn\u2019t say much about his character though. Her demands are outrageous in any culture.", "Absolutely NTA. And honestly, your cousin and his wife really don\u2019t seem truly compatible in my opinion. She has no business trying to dictate whether or not your children are in *their home* when they come to visit. You were more than gracious in my opinion and handled it better than I probably would\u2019ve.", "You're NTA!", "NTA", "INFO: does your cousin know about SIL's crazy demands? \n\nI honestly would ask cousin to leave wife home if he wants to see you.", "You offered to go out for the evening.  She declined, NTA", "Nta, if it was an event that she was hosting at her own home she would have the right to say no kids. At your house, where your kids live, she has absolutely zero right to say no kids. This woman has some serious balls to think she can ask you to remove your kids from their own home so she can get drunk.", "NTA  \nSound like the wife wants to make sure to drive a nice big wedge between you and your cousin. I hope you try your best not to let that happen, but kicking your children out for her, that's a no thanks!  \nThe entitlement is overwhelming. Make sit very obvious what she is doing.", "NTA - and you should keep having more children to ensure the witch never comes to your house.", "Emphatically NTA.\n\nYour SIL is an AH for demanding a mother kick her kids out of her own house for the night. This is not an event the SIL is hosting at her own home or venue, in which case she\u2019d be free to set rules, such as no children. This is your home, and both your children are little.\n\nFrankly, your SIL exhibits an unusual hostility to children. I do hope your cousin is on the same page as her about never wanting children. If he wants kids one day, this will be a problem.", "NTA. What in the world was she expected?! You to lock the kids up in a shed outside?! You gave her a very reasonable alternative. She does not get to invite herself to your home and tell you to boot your children out.", "Can\u2019t she kick back and let loose at her own child free home? And long may it last lmao \ud83e\udd23", "Agreed. Can't help but think that she knows what she's doing. She *wants* to make it impossible to catch up so that the cousins last encounter with family before they leave *for a year* is tainted by \"your family doesn't like me\".\n\nWho demands a party at *someone else's house* and then demands half the occupants *leave* so they can have the party they want? Someone who is either a) self-absorbed to the point of delusion, or b) someone with an ulterior motive.", "Or any family and culture.", "In a home that\u2019s not even her own. She sounds uber entitled.", "I can\u2019t wait to see her shocked Pikachu face when she has a child free wedding, and a good chunk of the cousins family don\u2019t come to the wedding. Sis is in for a rude awakening", "You made some good suggestions, all of which she turned down.", "This right here.\nIt\u2019s an impossible demand. One she knows can\u2019t be met. And on the off chance it could be, well she just succeeded in deciding who gets to be in OPs own house", "I agree. Not everyone likes to be around kids and it does change the dynamic. However when she offered to put the kids to bed SIL could have agreed.", "The title was misleading.", "Because only halfway through was it specified the party would be at the OP's home. I figured that this would be yet another parent bringing their kids to an external event that is explicitly childfree, and I suspect other readers felt the same."]}
