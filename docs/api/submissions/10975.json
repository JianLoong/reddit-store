So naturally, when he got married, I was super excited to welcome a sister in my life. My SIL is, however, not as excited as I was, and I get that. So the first time I got a cold vibe from her, I stepped back and apologized to her for overwhelming her. This happened a year back, and after this incident, we hardly met up a few times, and each time, we were civil. SIL is, at best, aloof from our family, and my cousin thinks that is because she comes from a completely different background, and her family was not as large as ours. I am not sure if it is necessary to mention this, but we are a South-Asian family (myself and cousin belonging to the 2nd generation), and SIL is White.\n\nWe later came to know that SIL does not like kids. Our family has a lot of them (my kids, as well as kids of other cousins), which is why she gets overwhelmed. So she started coming to our get-togethers less often, and we get that. She was always invited, but she would politely decline every time. \n\nComing to  the main topic, my cousin will have to relocate  to a different continent for a year and wanted to visit me once before leaving. He offered to come over to our place with SIL. I told him that they were always welcome. But SIL informed me that she wants to visit just us, and she doesn't want to be with the kids (I have 2, 5F and 2M). She just wants us adults. I offered that we could go out for dinner. She refused and told me that she wanted to drink and let loose. I told her that if she wants to come over to our place, then she is always welcome, but the kids will stay. I told them that the kids go to sleep by 7:30, and we can catch up after that. She refused to that as well. She wants us to keep the kids at some friend's house (we have many in the neighborhood). I told her 1) that I am not comfortable with keeping such young kids away for the night, and 2) this is our house, meaning the kids' house as well, and that she is the guest. So we get to decide if the kids stay or not. Now SIL thinks I am a huge dick  for refusing just one night of fun.\n\nAITA here? Should I have just listened to her?", "created_utc": 1677432889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cn9sp/aita_for_not_listening_to_my_sils_request_for_a/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
