{"id": 10975, "submission_id": "11cn9sp", "title": "AITA for not listening to my SIL's request for a child-free party?", "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here, and I will keep it as short as I can. \n\nI am extremely close to a cousin, and he is the closest to a sibling in my life, myself not having any sibling. So naturally, when he got married, I was super excited to welcome a sister in my life. My SIL is, however, not as excited as I was, and I get that. So the first time I got a cold vibe from her, I stepped back and apologized to her for overwhelming her. This happened a year back, and after this incident, we hardly met up a few times, and each time, we were civil. SIL is, at best, aloof from our family, and my cousin thinks that is because she comes from a completely different background, and her family was not as large as ours. I am not sure if it is necessary to mention this, but we are a South-Asian family (myself and cousin belonging to the 2nd generation), and SIL is White.\n\nWe later came to know that SIL does not like kids. Our family has a lot of them (my kids, as well as kids of other cousins), which is why she gets overwhelmed. So she started coming to our get-togethers less often, and we get that. She was always invited, but she would politely decline every time. \n\nComing to  the main topic, my cousin will have to relocate  to a different continent for a year and wanted to visit me once before leaving. He offered to come over to our place with SIL. I told him that they were always welcome. But SIL informed me that she wants to visit just us, and she doesn't want to be with the kids (I have 2, 5F and 2M). She just wants us adults. I offered that we could go out for dinner. She refused and told me that she wanted to drink and let loose. I told her that if she wants to come over to our place, then she is always welcome, but the kids will stay. I told them that the kids go to sleep by 7:30, and we can catch up after that. She refused to that as well. She wants us to keep the kids at some friend's house (we have many in the neighborhood). I told her 1) that I am not comfortable with keeping such young kids away for the night, and 2) this is our house, meaning the kids' house as well, and that she is the guest. So we get to decide if the kids stay or not. Now SIL thinks I am a huge dick  for refusing just one night of fun.\n\nAITA here? Should I have just listened to her?", "created_utc": 1677432889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cn9sp/aita_for_not_listening_to_my_sils_request_for_a/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds to me like SIL doesn't want to spend time with you at all but is making unreasonable requests she knows you'll refuse rather than simply being honest.", "Absolutely NTA. It's your house, your children and  her problem. You compromised and offered to go out for a farewell dinner.

There is no reason she couldn't come after 7:30 and never see the kids.", "You offered reasonable compromises such as going out or waiting until the kids are in bed.\n\nWanting you to essentially ditch your kids for a day so you can all get drunk is irresponsible and unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA for pushing back on SIL's ridiculous demands.\n\nBut the result is, you're not going to see your cousin (who you are as close to as a sibling) before he moves out of the country.

Is she summoning some sort of child-eating demon or something?", "NTA Absolutely not. Your SIL is. She has a lot of nerve asking you to remove your children from their own home. It's not like they'll be under foot. They'll be sleeping. And it's still not enough for her? Get together with your brother only and let your SIL stay in her child-free home.", "NTA - WHERE is your cousin while his wife is making these absolutely unreasonable demands?", "NTA\n\nSome child free people can be so weird.

Putting your children out of their beds so that an adult can drink too much and act like a clown is an unreasonable request. You offered reasonable compromises such as a night on the town and a post-kiddie-bedtime party. Other options exist for your SIL such as a binge at her own home. She's intentionally making drama and it doesn't look good on her.", "NTA.  SILs request is ridiculous.   You made several efforts to reach a compromise.   But it was her way or nothing.", "NTA.  Your SIL is entitled and sounds unpleasant", "NTA.  SIL is out of her mind demanding to be hosted at your children's home, then demand they are not there.

Yeah. Wow. The nerve and audacity of your SIL.", "That's not a cultural difference, your SIL is just an asshole.  I'm white and value kid free time but would never ask to visit the house if someone who has kids and then insist that they have to send their kids away.\n\nSuggest to your cousin that he just come visit you on his own to say goodbye.  SIL doesn't really like you anyway, why would she need goodbye party time with you?\n\nNTA", "NTA - She doesn\u2019t get to kick your kids out of their own home. You offered her viable kid-free alternatives.  \n\nHer demand to have you relocate your kids overnight is not something I have ever heard of.   This goes beyond not enjoying being around kids and is a weird hang-up of hers.", "NTA, your SIL is an entitled nutjob. I can't image telling someone to send their children away from their own home, so I could drink and let lose, lol. The nerve, wow. I'd tell my brother / cousin to come visit but leave his entitled wife behind.", "NTA this woman is so out of line. I\u2019m actually annoyed with your cousin too. Don\u2019t give him a pass - he knows this about her and is allowing it to affect his relationships with you and the rest for he family. If he wanted to see you badly enough (or your kids, who are also his family) he would find a way but is choosing not to. I won\u2019t even restrict my cats location for guests because it\u2019s their home first.

Barring an emergency, or a vacation/holiday, children sleep in their home. She's being ridiculous and frankly trying to control the time your cousin can spend with you.

Shrug, well I guess we won't get to see them before your trip.\"\n\nIs your cousin aware of this pleasant side of her?", "NTA.
