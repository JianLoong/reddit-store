Longtime lurker, first time poster.  I wouldn\u2019t be writing this if the opinions of the people in my life weren\u2019t so split, but here goes. \n\nI (29f) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9 \u201cTim\u201d (30m) next year. I\u2019ve only just begun shopping for a potential dress, but this is where the problem arises. \n\nTim\u2019s grandmother \u201cMary\u201d is in declining health. Based on what I know about her prognosis (it\u2019s terminal) she\u2019ll most likely live another year or two before she passes, so she might not be able to attend Tim and I\u2019s wedding. Mary was a seamstress when she was younger, and apparently it\u2019s become a family tradition to let her hand-make the wedding dresses for the women in Tim\u2019s family. \n\nRecently, Tim\u2019s mother came to me and asked me when I would be available to meet with Mary to discuss my dress. I was sort of surprised because no one asked me if I wanted to uphold this tradition, they just assumed I would, but I was nice about it and met up with Mary to talk about the dress. I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt. \n\nWhen I met with Mary, she showed me pictures of the dresses she had made in the past and asked me which one I\u2019d like. The problem is that none of the dresses she\u2019d made in the past were my style\u2014they were very old-fashioned, frilly, and just overall not for me. I had brought some pictures of dress styles I like, but when I showed them to Mary, she scoffed and said she doesn\u2019t know how to make those styles and that her dresses were much better than the \u201cmodern trash\u201d I had showed her. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to argue with her, so I just made up some excuse and left. I later contacted Tim\u2019s mother and said that I appreciated the offer, but I wanted to purchase my own wedding dress. \n\nThat\u2019s when shit hit the fan. Tim\u2019s mother showed up at our house and started screaming that I was being extremely disrespectful for refusing such a generous gift. She said that it was Mary\u2019s \u201cdying wish\u201d that she be able to make the wedding dresses for all the women in the family and I\u2019m basically spitting on her future grave by refusing it. It\u2019s true that she made the dresses for Tim\u2019s mother, aunt, sister, and female cousins, but I don\u2019t see why I should sacrifice feeling beautiful on MY wedding day for the sake of completing the set, so to speak. \n\nTim intervened and told his mom to leave, but since then all his relatives have been constantly spamming my phone telling me I\u2019m selfish for putting my own feelings over the happiness of a dying woman. Tim has stood by me and said he\u2019ll tell his relatives to fuck off if I want, but some of my own relatives have said I should just suck it up and wear the dress Mary makes because it\u2019s \u201cnot that big a deal\u201d and it\u2019ll make Mary be able to die with no regrets. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691771606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15odm3w/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fianc\u00e9s_grandma_to_make/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The bride gets to pick her own dress.  That's rule of the universe.", "NTA, if it's so important to Mary that she make your wedding dress she probably shouldn't have shit all over the styles you prefer. Dying doesn't give you the right to be an asshole, it just alleviates you of the consequences.", "NTA. \n\nTell them you gave Mary and idea of what you want for a dress and she\n 1.

This may be a compromise  .... but I would not let that energy anywhere near my actual wedding ceremony.", "NTA - They\u2019ll all upset that she\u2019s dying and that\u2019s ok. Pushing something you don\u2019t want on you is not respecting you or your boundaries.", "NTA. If she really wanted to help... she'd listen to what you want and try and suggest dresses that are more your style.\n\nI'm surprised that no one else in the family has ever said no to that tradition. \n\nBu if you wanted to compromise (which I don't think you have to), you could ask if she would make you something else - maybe a veil? An accessory? A second dress to wear... another time?", "NTA. You aren't a member of Tim's family. Mary is mistaken. If she wants to make you a dress once you get married, feel free to accept that.", "NTA \n\nThe reality is that you don\u2019t want an old fashioned dress for your wedding and that\u2019s okay.\n\nThey need to accept that and back off", "NTA.  I get their tradition, but the fact is she will not make the style of dress you want.  That is what your fianc\u00e9 needs to say to each and every one of them.  Throw it back on her.  Your wedding is not about her wish.", "You and your future husband are NTA here. Everyone who is using Mary\u2019s eventual demise as a tool to manipulate you into wearing something you hate on your wedding day are MASSIVE AH and should be ashamed of themselves. This is your wedding day. You want to look your best, and wearing something dated, that isn\u2019t your style, and would make you miserable is not the way. Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep them warm.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry that\u2019s so hard. But that\u2019s an insane ask to compromise on your wedding dress. It\u2019s your day and you have every right to wear what you want. \n\nIs there any way she could make you a dress for another event/photoshoot? Or try to involve her in some way? You did all the right things though.", "NTA.  Hell no!  She hand makes the dress for the women in TIM's family.  Not yours.  This is your dress and your day.  And not to be harsh, but what happens if she passes away before finishing the dress?  A dress you don't even want.  No, you shouldn't have to \"suck it up\" and yes, it is a big deal!", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re allowed to wear what you want. As pushy as these people are, watch out when you have kids. They will be trying to name the baby next.", "To be fair, you aren't refusing to have her make your dress - you are refusing to have a dress of which she dictates the make and style. Additionally, she blatantly insulted your taste, which is just rude. \n\nAs a compromise, you could ask/offer that she make a dress you could wear at some other function, like the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner, or a shower or something.  If that isn't good enough, that's on them. Hopefully, your fiance is 100% on your side and running interference with them, or this may not bode well.\n\nYou are allowed to choose your own wedding dress, NTA.\n\n(and if you get your own dress that she doesn't make, I'd password-protect the purchase with the store and keep that thing locked up so his family can't get to it. People can be crazy.)", "NTA but could you compromise and have her make your veil or something?", "NTA\n\nyour FMIL needs to watch Bridesmaids (among others) to see what can happen when someone else tries to force \\*THEIR\\* wishes on you.\n\nIt is your and your FH wedding and should be about you.", "There are A-holes littered throughout this story but you and your husband are absolutely not one of them.", "NTA.\n\nCan a compromise be made here though? Perhaps she can make a dress and you set up a photo shoot for before or right after the ceremony?", "NTA", "NTA.  The offer and gift by Mary is indeed generous.  However, this is yours and Tim's wedding.  You have every right to be able to wear what you want to wear on your day. Her reaction and Tim's family's reaction are AH moves.   Maybe there can be some kind of compromise?  She could make a dress you were after the wedding and reception or something for your honeymoon?", "NTA. People who tell you \u201dit\u2019s no big deal\u201d are the same people who say you should be a doormat to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. Those people are AH.  Maybe there is a compromise? Could she make a veil, or a dress you can wear to the rehearsal or flower girl dresses?", "NTA and fuck Mary\u2026and his relatives telling you to \u201csuck it up\u201d.  How is this even in doubt.", "Dude your monster in law sounds like a psycho. Just tell granny you don\u2019t fuck with her style of dresses but you appreciate the offer.  \n\nThere\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t make those old ass dresses anymore, because people evolve and want new ones. Good luck haha", "She can make it. But you don\u2019t have to wear it\u2026", "This is  rough one. You are absolutely NTA for wanting to wear a dress that you love and feel beautiful in, and it doesn't sound like Mary can give you that. However, your new family is facing the reality of loosing their mother/grandmother and really want her final year to be meaningful. Death is also uncertain: Mary might live several more years or she may pass tomorrow.  \n\nIn your shoes, I'd be letting Mary make me a dress, which I may or may not wear on my wedding day. I'd also find the dress of my dreams (within the limit of my budget). I would use the time with Mary getting to know a treasured member of my new family, and who knows, maybe the dress will surprise me. If not, maybe I'll wear it for some early photos with the new family and Mary, and then change into my preferred dress for the ceremony and reception and the rest of the photos.", "NTA about refusing the dress\n\nYTA for referring to your wedding as MY wedding day.
