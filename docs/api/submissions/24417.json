Longtime lurker, first time poster.  I wouldn\u2019t be writing this if the opinions of the people in my life weren\u2019t so split, but here goes. \n\nI (29f) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9 \u201cTim\u201d (30m) next year. I\u2019ve only just begun shopping for a potential dress, but this is where the problem arises. \n\nTim\u2019s grandmother \u201cMary\u201d is in declining health. Based on what I know about her prognosis (it\u2019s terminal) she\u2019ll most likely live another year or two before she passes, so she might not be able to attend Tim and I\u2019s wedding. Mary was a seamstress when she was younger, and apparently it\u2019s become a family tradition to let her hand-make the wedding dresses for the women in Tim\u2019s family. \n\nRecently, Tim\u2019s mother came to me and asked me when I would be available to meet with Mary to discuss my dress. I was sort of surprised because no one asked me if I wanted to uphold this tradition, they just assumed I would, but I was nice about it and met up with Mary to talk about the dress. I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt. \n\nWhen I met with Mary, she showed me pictures of the dresses she had made in the past and asked me which one I\u2019d like. The problem is that none of the dresses she\u2019d made in the past were my style\u2014they were very old-fashioned, frilly, and just overall not for me. I had brought some pictures of dress styles I like, but when I showed them to Mary, she scoffed and said she doesn\u2019t know how to make those styles and that her dresses were much better than the \u201cmodern trash\u201d I had showed her. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to argue with her, so I just made up some excuse and left. I later contacted Tim\u2019s mother and said that I appreciated the offer, but I wanted to purchase my own wedding dress. \n\nThat\u2019s when shit hit the fan. Tim\u2019s mother showed up at our house and started screaming that I was being extremely disrespectful for refusing such a generous gift. She said that it was Mary\u2019s \u201cdying wish\u201d that she be able to make the wedding dresses for all the women in the family and I\u2019m basically spitting on her future grave by refusing it. It\u2019s true that she made the dresses for Tim\u2019s mother, aunt, sister, and female cousins, but I don\u2019t see why I should sacrifice feeling beautiful on MY wedding day for the sake of completing the set, so to speak. \n\nTim intervened and told his mom to leave, but since then all his relatives have been constantly spamming my phone telling me I\u2019m selfish for putting my own feelings over the happiness of a dying woman. Tim has stood by me and said he\u2019ll tell his relatives to fuck off if I want, but some of my own relatives have said I should just suck it up and wear the dress Mary makes because it\u2019s \u201cnot that big a deal\u201d and it\u2019ll make Mary be able to die with no regrets. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691771606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15odm3w/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fianc\u00e9s_grandma_to_make/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck haha", "She can make it. But you don\u2019t have to wear it\u2026", "This is  rough one. You are absolutely NTA for wanting to wear a dress that you love and feel beautiful in, and it doesn't sound like Mary can give you that. However, your new family is facing the reality of loosing their mother/grandmother and really want her final year to be meaningful. Death is also uncertain: Mary might live several more years or she may pass tomorrow.  \n\nIn your shoes, I'd be letting Mary make me a dress, which I may or may not wear on my wedding day. I'd also find the dress of my dreams (within the limit of my budget). I would use the time with Mary getting to know a treasured member of my new family, and who knows, maybe the dress will surprise me. If not, maybe I'll wear it for some early photos with the new family and Mary, and then change into my preferred dress for the ceremony and reception and the rest of the photos.", "NTA about refusing the dress\n\nYTA for referring to your wedding as MY wedding day.

Do you want this kind of drama to be the beginning of your marriage? \n\nYou could use the dress for the ceremony and change to a beautiful dress for the reception.", "NTA. Are you sure you want to marry in to this family? They clearly have zero respect for you, your family and your traditions. You are not a member of Mary's family until AFTER the ceremony. It's completely inappropriate for them to demand she make your dress. What if you had a tradition with your family about the dress?", "NTA - You offered a compromise by showing her the kind of dress you wanted and she insulted your taste.  She and her famil are TAH.  \n\n\nLuckily, the spiteful and selfish woman will be gone soon.", "NTA", "NTA \nDo not cave to this bullshit or your entire life will be dictated by what those f@##\u00f7s want.", "It's funny how people always say to suck it up you don't have to do anything you don't want to do just a piece other peoples happiness is your happiness in your day do what's best for you they don't like it they don't need to attend", "NTA. There is no reason whatsoever that you have to go along with this \u201ctradition\u201d. It\u2019s just another way for his family to try to control you.", "NTA. His family is pissed because they all dealt with outdated dress styles. You find a dress that you feel beautiful in. Don't listen to them. Congratulations!", "NTA it's a sweet tradition - for those who want it. You don't, and there's nothing wrong with that. I suspect they are letting their heightened emotions over her pending death interfere with their reactions, but that's not your problem.", "I wouldn't want to get married in a gown that I hated either. Could you meet again privately with grandma and ask her to make something elegant and traditional looking but very simple, no puffs or frills? \n\nTim's family sounds like a real treat. At least your fiance is on your side. Some here on Reddit will side with mommy every time.", "NTA\n\nReminds me of another post on Reddit where the in-laws turned the wedding into a celebration for a dying grand-aunt. The bride was against it but was pushed to yield. She felt like she was attending a living wake rather than her wedding. Years later her husband finally asked why she didn't attach any special significance to their wedding. At which point she admitted she hadn't been able to enjoy it. Which of course upset her husband. Bitter memories all around. \n\nSo stand fast, this is about you and your husband, nobody else. Don't let your dream wedding be derailed by something as central as an ugly wedding dress.", "What about a wedding night nightgown. Then you can do with it what you like, wear it, don\u2019t wear it and it\u2019s something personal from her you can treasure. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "How bout she make you a rehearsal dinner dress? https://www.intheknow.com/post/moms-wedding-dress-transformed-rehearsal-dress/?amp", "NTA. On one of the most important days of my life, I wouldn't want to wear something I don't feel comfortable in.", "NTA \n\nGirl this lady straight up told you she thought your dress ideas were trash, she is clearly fine with speaking her mind. Maybe you could try telling her that you don't like that style and you'll go whichever route you need to take to make your dream come true? Maybe it won't work but they can't get anymore pressed than they already are.", "NTA\n\nYou may be past the point of saying this, but you could say that you realize that she is in declining health and you don't want her spending what precious time she has working like that?  \n\nAnd as an aside, this made me think of something.  Several posts on this subReddit involve wedding traditions.  Have we seen a scenario yet where wedding traditions from the two families clash?  What if the OP had a tradition in her family involving the wedding dress that would interfere with Grandma Mary making a dress?", "Every bride should have the dress they love on her wedding day.", "NTA But.. Just tell FMIL that if this is going to be a problem, you'll just have your wedding on a nude beach. Problem solved!", "NTA. It\u2019s awesome that your boyfriend is backing you up. However, the family\u2019s reaction is super concerning. A lot of people here have offered ideas for a compromise and it could be a good idea, BUT it\u2019s the compromise or nothing. She does NOT get to do your dress if you don\u2019t want to. And ask your fianc\u00e9 if there is any other funny tradition/last wish floating around, so you cam be ready for that fight.", "She can make you the dress for the rehearsal dinner and you will happily wear it. I think that\u2019s a great compromise for everyone, if you are looking for one. NTA", "NTA. A gift is supposed to be about the recipient, not the giver. There's nothing generous about forcing someone to accept a gift they don't want because the giver has an ego. And, as usual, we have a bunch of people who aren't being asked to make a sacrifice telling you it's no big deal. \n\nI don't know if you want to get into some kind of mud flinging match, but maybe some delicate way to say you were really hurt that she called your taste trash?", "Nta, is it possible to talk to the grandma on a compromise? Maybe she can make a veil or head piece \nYou can later pass on if you have future children?", "OP NTA. \n\nI wore a wedding dress 20+ years ago chosen by my MIL.\n\nA choice I regret until today. Don\u2019t do it", "NTA.  This is absurd.  You are the one wearing the dress, everyone else can fuck off with their opinions.", "ESH", "Whether it's a christening gown or something else that could be easily passed down, I would say this is the way to approach it should keep everyone happy.\n\nIf OP already has a christening gown in her family that she'd want to use, or already knows there won't be kids, or doesn't believe in the practice, other alternatives could be:\n\n* ring pillow\n* getting ready gown (purposely made to fit a multitude of sizes of women)\n* veil\n\nOP could also approach grandma and say that while the wedding dress idea doesn't fit with her style (or her family traditions of going dress shopping with OP's mother or whatever other thing she wants to come up with), that she'd love something made by grandma that could serve another purpose. Depending on grandma's abilities, this could be anything from a more casual dress, a skirt, pillows, etc.\n\nThere are ways to honour the idea and find a way to compromise that works for OP. Stop talking to others about it though. Brainstorm with your FH and then both of you go talk with Grandma on your own. Leave your future MIL out of it.\n\nOP, you are NTA for not wanting the handmade dress.", "This is a GREAT idea! \n\nA christening gown can be passed from generation to generation. It becomes a family heirloom. Grandma Mary's skills as a seamstress will not be lost.\n\nMy family has a christening gown like this. It was first worn by my grandmother (late 1800's); used with Grandma's 5 children, 23 grandchildren, don't know how many great grands, right on down to a couple of great-great grandkids (my kids included!). It was finally 'retired' in the early 2000's; just too fragile to use anymore. \n\nIn all, close to 100 family members have worn that gown. It's now framed, hangs on a wall, and will *still* be passed down.", "Lots of people today don't have their children christened.", "Dang it, now I gotta save this line:\n\n        Dying doesn't give you the right to be an asshole, it just alleviates you of the consequences.", ">Dying doesn't give you the right to be an asshole, it just alleviates you of the consequences\n\nSuch a good line!\n\nAnd yeah, I can't imagine Mary calling the OP's tastes \"trash\" endeared her to the idea of continuing the tradition.", "I had the same thought, but the OP not wearing the dress that Mary made might create more issues than there already are.", "They probably all did! Fiance's mom and other women in the family probably sucked it up and wore the monstrosities in the actual 70s and 80s, probably still resent it, and think it's unfair that OP won't have to suffer the same thing.", "I can't even imagine the crap that would fall on OP if she let Mary make the dress and then didn't wear it for the actual wedding. Much better to let Mary sew another dress or a christening gown as someone else suggested.", "Well Tim supports her decision, so it sounds like they are already acting as a married couple and acting as a united front.", "A dying women wants to feel useful to her family and make something that means she'll be present for the last wedding of her grandchild's generation. \n\nCompromise is essential in this situation."]}
