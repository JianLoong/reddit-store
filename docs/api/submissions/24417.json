Longtime lurker, first time poster.  I wouldn\u2019t be writing this if the opinions of the people in my life weren\u2019t so split, but here goes. \n\nI (29f) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9 \u201cTim\u201d (30m) next year. I\u2019ve only just begun shopping for a potential dress, but this is where the problem arises. \n\nTim\u2019s grandmother \u201cMary\u201d is in declining health. Based on what I know about her prognosis (it\u2019s terminal) she\u2019ll most likely live another year or two before she passes, so she might not be able to attend Tim and I\u2019s wedding. Mary was a seamstress when she was younger, and apparently it\u2019s become a family tradition to let her hand-make the wedding dresses for the women in Tim\u2019s family. \n\nRecently, Tim\u2019s mother came to me and asked me when I would be available to meet with Mary to discuss my dress. I was sort of surprised because no one asked me if I wanted to uphold this tradition, they just assumed I would, but I was nice about it and met up with Mary to talk about the dress. I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt. \n\nWhen I met with Mary, she showed me pictures of the dresses she had made in the past and asked me which one I\u2019d like. The problem is that none of the dresses she\u2019d made in the past were my style\u2014they were very old-fashioned, frilly, and just overall not for me. I had brought some pictures of dress styles I like, but when I showed them to Mary, she scoffed and said she doesn\u2019t know how to make those styles and that her dresses were much better than the \u201cmodern trash\u201d I had showed her. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to argue with her, so I just made up some excuse and left. I later contacted Tim\u2019s mother and said that I appreciated the offer, but I wanted to purchase my own wedding dress. \n\nThat\u2019s when shit hit the fan. Tim\u2019s mother showed up at our house and started screaming that I was being extremely disrespectful for refusing such a generous gift. She said that it was Mary\u2019s \u201cdying wish\u201d that she be able to make the wedding dresses for all the women in the family and I\u2019m basically spitting on her future grave by refusing it. It\u2019s true that she made the dresses for Tim\u2019s mother, aunt, sister, and female cousins, but I don\u2019t see why I should sacrifice feeling beautiful on MY wedding day for the sake of completing the set, so to speak. \n\nTim intervened and told his mom to leave, but since then all his relatives have been constantly spamming my phone telling me I\u2019m selfish for putting my own feelings over the happiness of a dying woman. Tim has stood by me and said he\u2019ll tell his relatives to fuck off if I want, but some of my own relatives have said I should just suck it up and wear the dress Mary makes because it\u2019s \u201cnot that big a deal\u201d and it\u2019ll make Mary be able to die with no regrets. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691771606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15odm3w/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fianc\u00e9s_grandma_to_make/", "score": 614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck haha", "She can make it. But you don\u2019t have to wear it\u2026", "This is  rough one. You are absolutely NTA for wanting to wear a dress that you love and feel beautiful in, and it doesn't sound like Mary can give you that. However, your new family is facing the reality of loosing their mother/grandmother and really want her final year to be meaningful. Death is also uncertain: Mary might live several more years or she may pass tomorrow.  \n\nIn your shoes, I'd be letting Mary make me a dress, which I may or may not wear on my wedding day. I'd also find the dress of my dreams (within the limit of my budget). I would use the time with Mary getting to know a treasured member of my new family, and who knows, maybe the dress will surprise me. If not, maybe I'll wear it for some early photos with the new family and Mary, and then change into my preferred dress for the ceremony and reception and the rest of the photos.", "NTA about refusing the dress\n\nYTA for referring to your wedding as MY wedding day.

Because of this, they don't have the same dress in multiple sizes. I guess I should also mention I am a petite woman but with a fairly large chest. I found one I love, but slightly too big. It was perfect because it hid my chest well, despite being strapless. All the dress needed was a shortening of the gown and pinched at the top above my breasts. I wanted to take the dress to a tailor but my husband was already freaking out about me spending $600 on the dress and suggested his mom could tailor it since she has been sewing since she was a child and even made his clothes growing up. I've seen her work, she makes beautiful quilts, but her clothes look amateur. But to not insult her, I let her tailor the dress. When she took measurements I told her I just wanted the top tucked so there was no space between the dress and my breast, I felt it fit comfortably around the ribs. She insisted on taking my band size even though I explained to her that whenever I purchase something according to my band size, it's always too tight and to just draw in the cups by a half inch. Well long story short, when I walked down the aisle and my husband saw me for the first time, my husband was embarrassed I was popping out the top of my dress and just wanted to cover me up. I spent the entire ceremony and pictures with the bouquet directly in front of my cleavage because I was literally spilling out of my dress. After the wedding I showed my husband what it looked like when I tried it on and he agreed it looked beautiful. I wish I had it tailored professionally because not only was I embarrassed the day of my wedding, but I can't even look at my wedding photos without feeling disgust or embarrassment.\n\nGet the dress you want, that you will feel good and look good in.

It was a dowdy thing, very much like the dresses this grandma of yours sews, I imagine. But at least your man stands by you.\n\nThe reason I bring The Practice up is that I think Lindsay made a mistake in not absolutely refusing in no uncertain terms even to consider wearing Dylan's mother's old dress. Sometimes, being nice only encourages the anger of the person you are eventually going to say no to.\n\nSo I wonder if you were too pleasant about grandma and her Singer. You were just being polite, I know--but if you had made a stand then and there in a ferocious tone, these idiots might not have been encouraged to fall on you now like a pack of crows. \n\nI always think it's best, when someone tells me about something I can or should or might do, to cry, \"No!\" without even considering it.

She then had a silk mermaid gown on her wedding day. 2010s! \n\nI don't know if a compromise like that could work or if everyone would have kittens about it not being the day-of dress. Or even if you want to do a compromise. Another idea would be to have a wedding shower themed on wear your dress, and you could invite every woman of the family to wear their dress Mary made (or a veil, whatever they have that fits) and bring pictures of the dresses and wear a Mary-made dress to that. You can make Mary the guest of honor and everyone can treat her like a queen and cry about all the family memories. Hire a photographer and make a memory book for all the ladies of the family. If you do that, you will be in. And then you can give your MiL a big framed picture of her and Mary together the first holiday after she passes.", "The thought of grandma dying with regrets is what gets me. Regretting what?

Will there be a ceremony and a reception? Would you be willing to wear a dress made by Mary for the ceremony, provided that SHE also compromise on the style, to the ceremony and a dress of your choosing to the reception? If this is an option you'd like to consider, I'd definitely take Tim's mother as well as your own back to Mary's for the next planning session, along with styles you'd consider. Let Tim's mom see how you're willing to compromise and if Mary isn't, it will be plain as day and you will be off the hook.", "NTA.

You didn't know about this in advance, and even if you did, you do not owe it to anyone to be uncomfortable and displeased with what you're wearing - not just on your wedding day but in general.

As she\u2019s unwell maybe instead of taking on a massive project like a dress she could make something smaller to wear on your wedding that you can use again or a keepsake you can pass on to your kids to use for special occasions like prom or their wedding for example long/short wedding gloves, a veil or a shawl/shrug/jacket to match your dress, a matching bag something you don\u2019t have to wear all day and can remove. Or ask her to make the flower girls dresses that can be as frilly as she wants. Maybe you could see if she\u2019ll be willing to design a wedding dress together.

Anyone who insists on being an ass about this should just RSVP \"no.\" If they've already RSVP'd \"yes,\" you may want to ask if they would like you to change their RSVP if the idea of you wearing your own dress is so abhorrent.\n\nI do like the idea of trying to get Mary to contribute her sewing skills in another way. The christening gown is a lovely idea.\n\nIf you wanted to be really crass: Mary will be dead in a couple of years, and you will have your wedding photos forever. So why would you give a damn about Mary's dying wish? If the options are Mary's feeling are hurt for a couple of years or you get to be beautiful on your wedding day and in the photos you keep....
