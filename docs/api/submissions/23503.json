Feminism is about *equality!*\n\nNTA.  You are supporting the education of women in your family and I salute you for that.", "I honestly don\u2019t care what you promised your money your decision why is she feel so entitled to what you had when you were already being nice makes no sense to me not the asshole", "Remind her she already stole a complete semester's college payment from him. NTA", "I would highly suggest from this point forward having the person who\u2019s education you are paying for send you the bills which instructions on how to pay them that way u KNOW where the money goes so NOT just send money to any of them whatever it is they need have them send the bill to u say \u201crent, tuition, books, ect) if ur the one paying the bills then there\u2019s no money coming up missing if ur paying the electric bill have them send u the electric bill with a number u can call to speak to someone about getting it paid only let the money go from ur account to where ever that bill is to like for tuition the money goes from ur account to the collage period that way no one is taking the money from u or even require receipts they want to pay their rent that\u2019s fine make them provide u with a receipt that has all the information the amount of the rent the amount that\u2019s been paid make sure it\u2019s signed and dated by the land lord u have to protect ur asserts because people get greedy and money hungry and if they can find a way to take u for all u have they will", "NTA- you don't have to pay for her apartment.  That's ridiculous.", "NTA. She still has access to that money, for when she chooses to use it for her betterment. She\u2019s very young & has plenty of time to decide. She shouldn\u2019t have assumed anything. It\u2019s no different from a scholarship. If she decides not to gain a further skill or education, I\u2019d maybe add it to a college fund for her child.", "NTA. What a wonderful gift you are giving to the girls in your family. BRAVO!", "NTA Defrauding money from relatives by lying to them isn't feminism. Sister should be glad you didn't ask her to return the last semesters money!", "NTA - your money your choice. Very entitled that one.", "NTA - your money your choice. Very entitled that one.", "NTA - your money your choice. Very entitled that one.", "NTA. You offered to pay for school. This isn\u2019t school", "NTA  \n\n\nbut what's an undiagnosed ADHD?", "OP, make sure your will is worded in a way that only those who have not dropped out of AND not finished college yet receive something. Otherwise, in the unlikely event something happened to you, she might profit yet again. \n\nAlso, NTA obviously.", "NTA - college fund is college fund.", "So do you think that  OP\u2019s family was right about not having women educated , because they can find men who can \u201csupport\u201d them anyway so who needs an education ??", "I got my diagnosis 3years ago (I'm 31) so I struggled through elementary/high school and got labeled as misbehaving/stupid kid.", "What about oldest sister? If she\u2019s paying off loans, I would argue that she should get any extra money to pay down that debt a bit", "Exactly. If she goes back to school, she should show proof of completion of a semester before you agree to start paying again", "OP should also be careful even paying the school though. when my uncle was dying, he wanted to give me and my sibling whatever we wanted as we were the children of his favourite brother who had just died. he begged me to take a Hawaiian vacation and a few grand for spending there, but all I asked for was an $80 Walmart item I needed and refused the rest.... he didn't know my sibling at the time had serious mental issues and was hella manipulative/shady (he didn't know us growing up much) and paid thousands for my sibling's college. he thought because he paid the college direct, it was on the up and up. but they withdrew from classes and got $5000 refunded and blew it immediately. point being, if you withdraw from classes or drop classes before a certain period it can be almost entirely refunded for cash. OP would have to somehow set it up if they could to prevent that. since the sister stole the semester's cash one time already, OP should be very very careful. OP also needs to explain to each girl that they do not have individual funds, and there are no \"leftovers\". OP should also make a plan for what to do with the expensive textbooks and other supplies after each semester. ie is each girl allowed to sell them and keep the cash? if so, OP needs to look into what books or supplies are required and make sure they aren't getting ones to sell. same goes to paying for accommodation or any bills- make sure they aren't double dipping by getting secret roommates, moving somewhere cheaper, or anything like that.", "Or apparently Korea, been reading a lot that their country is getting more and more sexist over the years. Possibly Japan or Russia. A decent number of countries in Central and South America. And those are just the countries I try to keep up with in terms of news/political ongoing.", "Nah, English is too good for that", "That was actually my second thought, lawsuit or settlement but I wouldn't call either of those things technically lucky lol Something bad had to have happened to OP to get a good amount from either of those..", "IS not like the world has evolved to an era of equality, but thinking that college is paid only to the men in the family doesnt really align with a lot of countries where tend to be more college educated than the men. For example some of the countries that you list, this is the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Europe this wouldnt be a thing given that education is free, in South or central america, education is mostly for women, and theres no concept of improving the chances of economic success of the family by highly educating the male kids in fact a lot of South american countries then to be socialist and feminism is rampant in academic environments, Russia is the same men tend to have a lower education than the women, and Education is free.\n\nJapan maybe, not the worst country of Asia by far."]}
