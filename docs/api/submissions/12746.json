I live with my husband and newborn in our own home. My brother (23m) is in college and lives at home with our parents.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, one of my brother's/parent's cats was losing weight. I went over there to examine him and didn't find anything obvious other than weight loss and dehydration from not eating. \n\nMy first word of advice has always been to bring them to a vet if they are ill, but they have always been incredibly resistant to spending any money on medical care for their pets. About 7 years ago, I spent $3000 on a lifesaving surgery for this same cat because my dad said at the time to just \"let him die.\" The stipulation at the time of this surgery was that I will pay for it, but he would have to be an indoor cat for the rest of his life. The family agreed. \n\nAfter the surgery, my brother was letting this cat outside almost daily. I warned him many times of the risks not only due to the surgery he had, but because he is totally unvaccinated, not on flea/tick prevention etc.\n\nFast forward now to 8 months ago... I tell them I can perform blood work at my job, but because I work in a specialty practice they would be better off going to a regular vet. To my surprise, they agreed and took him to a local vet. The blood work showed that the cat had either contracted a serious illness from a stray cat, or was possibly suffering from cancer and needed more tests to diagnose.\n\nMy parents refused more testing and agreed to give subcutaneous fluids to help hydrate him, but this was palliative care at best.\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my brother called me and was very upset. He was crying and frantic, saying the cat could no longer lift his head and seemed like he was dying. He wanted me to drive down there after work and help him. I admit, the pregnancy hormones and exhaustion got the better of me and I lost my cool. I said that this is exactly what I said would happen, that the poor cat is suffering and now is actively dying, and there's likely nothing anyone can do for him. My brother asked me if I think this is happening because he always let the cat outside and I was honest and said it's possible but there's no way to know for sure. I told him to deal with it himself and that he didn't need me to have the cat put to sleep. I feel like he wanted me to offer monetary assistance, but he didn't outright ask. \n\n\nMy brother and mom ended up bringing the cat to an emergency hospital and having him put to sleep. My brother hasn't spoken to me since that day. My sister says he feels like I blamed him for the cat's death. I have apologized for yelling at him several times through text but he does not respond. \n\nDo I deserve this?

It\u2019s like everyone wants you to help them but you can\u2019t. You\u2019re not a vet.

OP shouldn't need to coddle him.", "OP should, it's his fault. He's 23 and old enough to understand basic pet ownership. He needs to have accountability for his negligence.", "They shouldn't get a new cat if they're just going to pull the same shit they did with the previous one, especially if they're getting a pet under the condition that they never pay for its medical expenses.", "Thank you for your judgement.

If it were me once I had spent $3000 on the cat I'd have then demanded ownership of the cat and refused to allow them to keep it since they clearly have NO BUSINESS owning a pet if they aren't willing to provide medical care including preventative care for the animal.", "NTA - you gave them specific instructions which they chose not to follow. They also did not vaccinate the cat. They are now dealing with the consequences of those choices. Poor kitty, RIP.", "NTA I dunno why you apologized as he did to some degree contribute to his cat's death. Hell, if he just kept kitty indoors the cat would most likely still be alive and if he got more testing the cat still might've been saved.", "NTA. Grief oftentimes distorts our perspective. I think that its not unusual for some people to experience hostility and anger or want someone to blame for their grief. You've done nothing wrong. And I understand why you feel your brother's pains too. You didn't cause his pains though. You've been a great and consistent support to him. I'd give him some room to navigate his hurt.", "NTA, but what a heartbreaking situation. you did your best, OP.", "NTA- you shouldn't say that you refused to help a dying animal. It sounds to me that you are the only person who was helping this poor cat. You paid medical expenses. You demanded he was taken to the vet when he first had symptoms. You feel bad because you told your brother it was his responsibility and fault. On a normal day this would be a horrible thing to say. Except for if im understanding correctly, it's true. He knew that letting this cat go outside would be bad for his health. He then continued to do so. Then, he knew the cat was seriously ill, likely due to letting him outside and he declined treatment. He also didn't give the cat to someone who could take better care of him (assuming money was the reason). \n\nYou did everything you could for this cat. By the time you got that last call the only humane thing to do was to end it's suffering. A cat that can't even lift its head is beyond treatment. Poor cat.", "NTA but please reach out to all local shelters and rescues to ensure that they can\u2019t get another pet. The risk that they could do this to another animal is high.", "NTA", "NTA\nYou told them what could happen to the cat if they refused to listen to your advice. You also never said to your brother \"yer it's totally your fault and you killed the car cos you kept letting it out\" all you said was it's possible which it totally is. You don't deserve this at all. Give him some space and let him deal with the loss as he is most likely blaming himself and rather than accept it he is trying to push all the blame and his hurt onto you.", "NTA.\n\nYou went above and beyond for this cat, and gave clear instructions on how to proceed after your generous gift in order to maximize the cat\u2019s longevity and quality of life. Those instructions were ignored. You can neither confirm nor refute the possibility that the choice to ignore your instructions resulted in the cat\u2019s illness and death. And if the cat was so sick that it could no longer lift its head, it was already beyond your ability to fix. \n\nYour brother needs to process this. If he intends to get another cat, or really any animal, he needs to internalize the lessons he learned from this experience. I seriously doubt that he continued to let the cat free-range because he *wanted* the cat to get sick, but he *did* fail to accept that it was a real risk, and that it *could* have led to the cat\u2019s unnecessary suffering. Hopefully he remembers this with the next animal, and proceeds with a little more caution, and a little more respect for the advice of the people who are actually trained to keep pets healthy. The pain he\u2019s feeling now will drive that point home far better than platitudes and sugarcoating.", "Poor kitty meowkers. NTA but your family are AHs. They did wrong by that cat and you did everything you could. Also you were pregnant and your brother pulling this AH move was not cool. It was his fault. Actions have consequences and his actions caused the death of the family cat.", "Trying to treat a serious illness like that in a pet can be really cruel, too.  You have to know when to let them go.", "I feel you. I would do the same when I was a tech. I actually paid for my brother in law and his wife\u2019s new puppy\u2019s exams, vaccines, preventatives, etc. out of my own pocket and used my discounts at my job in order to help them only to have my (former) sister in law be so blatantly rude and awful to my boss that he actually fired her as a client. I was livid when I found out because my boss(the practice owner) didn\u2019t even tell me about it because he knew i was trying to help family out and didn\u2019t see it as reflecting badly on me.

That means saying no to adults who are capable of taking care of things themselves but just want to foist it off on you.\n\nYour brother is an adult who made certain choices and has to live with the consequences.  Even if he had vaccinated the cat and kept it inside and it developed cancer in spite of perfect care, it still wouldn't be your responsibility to drive down and take care of the cat.  \n\nSeeing a pet in pain and at end of life is heartbreaking.  But it's something we all have to step up and deal with if we want the joy that pets bring us the rest of the time.   (Or the headaches and chaos that my 1yo cat brings!!!)", "The spca has the power and authority to remove pets if they're being abused or neglected and in need of proper medical attention. They can also put the owners on a don't adopt list to make sure they can't adopt from any shelters in the future.", "I often used my employee discounts to get their pets' blood work done and consulted with many different veterinarian friends to get free medical advice for their pets. And yet I still feel like I should have done more, but you know we don't make enough to be paying for everyone else's animals as well as our own.", "Thank you. I agree, my brother is an adult. I'm heartbroken that he doesn't want anything to do with me because our relationship was great before this happened. I've doubted myself so much since then that I finally decided to make this post.", "Reported for incivility", "I used to do the same and the ones that were truly thankful and actually needed my advice I was happy to help but for those that took advantage of it and didn\u2019t take my advice I just stopped helping.

It sucks because you know it means the animal ultimately suffers but unfortunately, we can\u2019t save them all no matter how badly we want to.", "Oh no... the horror.", "Again", "For what?", "NTA.  People don\u2019t want to take responsibility for their own mistakes.  He can\u2019t face up to the pain and would rather blame you.  You can express sympathy but don\u2019t apologize and don\u2019t blame.  He knows what he did and he knows you know.  I hope you and your brother are able to reconnect", "Yta for lying. \u2018Yes, it\u2019s probably your fault. I told you not to let him out\u2019 he\u2019s a big boy.

If it was cancer then, it was unpreventable. You had reason to believe disease was more likely, so that's how you chose to view it. They waited 8 months to go to the vet either way so...\n\nNTA", "I think your brother is processing. And probably doing a little bit of hiding. This might be the first time he\u2019s truly screwed up in a way he couldn\u2019t fix, in a way that *no one* could fix, and that\u2019s a painful and humiliating reality to face. \n\nYou are the one who went above and beyond for this cat, and you are the one who knew *exactly* how risky his choices were. You are the one person who\u2019s in a position to dish out an \u201cI told you so.\u201d The fact that he made the connection between the cat\u2019s illness and his decision to let her outdoors *on his own* tells you he was already on the edge of accepting some blame for the cat\u2019s illness. Your response clinched it. He knows he fucked up, he knows *you* know he fucked up, and he\u2019s ashamed on top of his grief. \n\nI don\u2019t think your relationship is ruined forever. I think he needs time to come to terms with all this. And, hopefully, to come out of the process wiser than he was before."]}
