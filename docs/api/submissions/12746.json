{"id": 12746, "submission_id": "11wgpm2", "title": "AITA for refusing to help a dying cat", "selftext": "Hey all. For background, I (33f) am a vet tech. I live with my husband and newborn in our own home. My brother (23m) is in college and lives at home with our parents.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, one of my brother's/parent's cats was losing weight. I went over there to examine him and didn't find anything obvious other than weight loss and dehydration from not eating. \n\nMy first word of advice has always been to bring them to a vet if they are ill, but they have always been incredibly resistant to spending any money on medical care for their pets. About 7 years ago, I spent $3000 on a lifesaving surgery for this same cat because my dad said at the time to just \"let him die.\" The stipulation at the time of this surgery was that I will pay for it, but he would have to be an indoor cat for the rest of his life. The family agreed. \n\nAfter the surgery, my brother was letting this cat outside almost daily. I warned him many times of the risks not only due to the surgery he had, but because he is totally unvaccinated, not on flea/tick prevention etc.\n\nFast forward now to 8 months ago... I tell them I can perform blood work at my job, but because I work in a specialty practice they would be better off going to a regular vet. To my surprise, they agreed and took him to a local vet. The blood work showed that the cat had either contracted a serious illness from a stray cat, or was possibly suffering from cancer and needed more tests to diagnose.\n\nMy parents refused more testing and agreed to give subcutaneous fluids to help hydrate him, but this was palliative care at best.\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my brother called me and was very upset. He was crying and frantic, saying the cat could no longer lift his head and seemed like he was dying. He wanted me to drive down there after work and help him. I admit, the pregnancy hormones and exhaustion got the better of me and I lost my cool. I said that this is exactly what I said would happen, that the poor cat is suffering and now is actively dying, and there's likely nothing anyone can do for him. My brother asked me if I think this is happening because he always let the cat outside and I was honest and said it's possible but there's no way to know for sure. I told him to deal with it himself and that he didn't need me to have the cat put to sleep. I feel like he wanted me to offer monetary assistance, but he didn't outright ask. \n\n\nMy brother and mom ended up bringing the cat to an emergency hospital and having him put to sleep. My brother hasn't spoken to me since that day. My sister says he feels like I blamed him for the cat's death. I have apologized for yelling at him several times through text but he does not respond. \n\nDo I deserve this?

When I read the title i thought YTA, but you already put all the effort into keeping this cat alive while your family did nothing. It looks like since you're the vet, everyone thinks it's your responsibility. You already spent $3000 on surgeries, plus who knows what else. Your brother can follow your instructions next time and while it's incredibly sad they had to put the cat down, it's not your responsibility.", "NTA.

It's totally unknown what the cause of death was, whether being outside contributed to that or not. But it doesn't matter as there was nothing you could do.

You did help this poor kitty and kitty was rid of life", "NTA - from sound of cat, then it was too late for anything but PTS. Recieving vet would have suggested alternative treatment if suitable. And responsibility for vet care rests with owner. You'd already been generous before.\n\nYou are blamed because it is easier to blame you than take responsibility. I have had pets done and it is always could of, should of, would of even if they are dying at equivalent of over a hundred from old age conditions. It is so much worse if die young from congenital, cancer or something like an accident you might of, should off avoided.\n\nBut nothing yoou said wasn't what the other vet had already had. Cat either had cancer or a disease passed on from interaction with other cats. If the second, then it was because his cat lived outdoors. Hopefully a very sad lesson learnt to benefit of next cat if one. But if cancer, then usually not much to be done except extending life and suspect no post mortem.", "NTA- if only people would listen, this is on them. You did everything you could to help them", "Nta - like WTF the cat was sick for awhile and they didn\u2019t take to vet or when they did- did not agree to do all tests needed. Poor cat suffered needlessly and maybe could have been cured if they had done something sooner.", "NTA, your family didn\u2019t take the cat\u2019s health seriously and you did.", "NTA\n\nA man jumps in the river and says \"god will save me\".

Just to clarify, I am not a vet, but a vet tech. Think more like a nurse. So I am not supposed to diagnose or prescribe anything according to my license. \n\nYou are also correct in assuming I have paid for many other medical fees for their pets. Eventually I put my foot down when I bought my own home and got married. My own pets are well cared for and we have several. I also was 7 months pregnant at the time and suffering from extreme nausea/vomiting. I was miserable, not that it matters in the grand scheme of things. I feel terrible that the cat suffered.
