She left him when I was 2 & since he was a narcissist criminal, we never got child support from him. My mother was an alcoholic & worked 2nd shift (by choice) my entire childhood. And NOT because it paid more like everyone in the comments is assuming, but because she \u201cjust enjoyed it more.\u201d She liked going to the bar every night after work with her other late shift friends. She did temporarily switched to 1st shift for someone she was dating, but when it didn\u2019t work out, she immediately switch back to 2nd. So she\u2019d do it for a relationship, but not to be there for her child..\n\nI started staying home alone at age 8 & literally raised myself from then on. I literally never saw my mom all week & sometimes not on the weekends either. I was on my own from the time I woke up until I went to bed. I got myself to & from school alone & then stayed home alone all night, feeding myself, doing my homework, not burning the house down, etc., while my mom worked nights (voluntarily) & then got drunk the rest of the time.\n\nWell, now I\u2019m grown & going through a rough time financially, thanks to COVID & physical/mental health issues. My mom on the other hand is finally doing well & has plenty of money in her savings. The law finally caught up with my father & his wages are being garnished for VERY back child support. lol\n\nI just got in a fight with my mom because I felt like the child support was perfect timing to help me financially, so maybe it could help, you know, support her child, instead of just be extra funds for her upcoming vacation.\n\nFOR THE RECORD, I KNOW ITS LEGALLY HERS.\n\nSo I\u2019m not asking from a legal stand point.

We\u2019ve had a complicated relationship throughout my life & now live 3K miles apart, on opposite coasts. When we got into this argument on the phone, she tried to tell me I was spoiled as a kid! I lost it & haven\u2019t talked to her since. We were poor. I got free lunches at school. I lived a sad lonely childhood. I was SERIOUSLY NEGLECTED & ABUSED! For her to think I was SPOILED just because she managed to put a roof over my head seriously hurt me. Like how could she not see what was wrong?! I can\u2019t imagine putting a child through what she put me through.\n\nIdk, maybe we are both being selfish, but I guess I thought she\u2019d be happy to FINALLY be able to help me & be there for me, like she never was growing up. I would want to make it up to my child if I put them through all that & could help!

I started staying home alone at age 8 & literally raised myself from then on. I literally never saw my mom all week. I was on my own from the time I woke up until I went to bed. I got myself to & from school alone & then stayed home alone all night, feeding myself, doing my homework, not burning the house down, etc., while my mom worked nights (voluntarily btw, she could have switch to the day shift, but didn\u2019t want to) & then got drunk the rest of the time.\n\nWell, now I\u2019m 38 & going through a rough time financially, thanks to COVID & physical/mental health issues. My mom on the other hand is finally doing well & has plenty of money in her savings. The law finally caught up with my father & his wages are being garnished for back child support. I just got in a fight with my mom because I feel like child support should be for the child, not to mention, I actually need it & she doesn\u2019t. She believes she\u2019s entitled to keep it for herself, because she \u201craised\u201d me. Sure she put a roof over my head & we got by, but I had a very sad & only childhood, not to mention exposure to a lot of drugs & alcohol, that I shouldn\u2019t have been.

For her to think I was SPOILED seriously hurt me.\n\nIdk, maybe we are both being selfish, but once a child is grown & went without growing up, I feel like child support should just go to the child at that point, especially if they actually need it.

But the fact remains that your mom was the one paying the bills, buying groceries, necessities, etc. If your dad would have been paying child support when you were growing up, that would have eased the financial burden on your mom. But because he didn't, she was spending more of her money. So the child support that your dad is now paying is basically just reimbursing your mom for what she spent over the years.
