We have lived together for one year now and I believe we have a wonderful relationship.\n\nAbout eight months ago, my girlfriend tried to wash an electric kettle that I had. She essentially disassembled part of it to scrub it clean. It was a $30 kettle and I figured it was not a big deal because it was an honest mistake.\n\nFast forward four months. I bought a new blender for $600. It was something I had wanted for about a year, and I finally pulled the trigger and bought it. When I was reading the instruction manual, I saw that it said you should never attempt to disassemble or take it apart to better clean it. I told my girlfriend that under no circumstances should she try to remove any parts of it like she did the kettle. She got a bit upset that I brought that up, but I told her I was just using it as an example.\n\nThree weeks ago, my girlfriend did exactly what I told her not to. She removed part of the blender to \"get a better wash\" on the blades, couldn't reassemble it, and then put all the tiny parts in a bag. I tried to reassemble it myself and failed as well. Then I emailed their customer support, who essentially responded with \"You should have read the instructions.\" I did but... yeah. \n\nYesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, and I told her that instead of getting her a gift this year, I would be buying myself a new blender. She was furious. I did take her out to a nice dinner a couple of nights before that. My girlfriend didn't even bother to open the door when the delivery guy came to drop it off, leaving it open to porch pirates stealing it. When I asked why she didn't even try she just shrugged.\n\nI don't know if I should be going to Tiffany's to get something to apologize or if I was being reasonable here.

Look, I think punishing someone on their birthday is unkind but it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t do anything for her birthday, you still took her out on a night dinner. It looks like people are complaining that you\u2019re punishing her for a mistake, but this doesn\u2019t feel like a mistake to me, she broke the blender after doing something she was specifically told not to do. $600 for a blender is a steep price for a kitchen appliance imo, and your girlfriend was specifically told NOT to disassemble it and did it anyways. Then when you replaced the blender she broke, she didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to bring it inside. Actions have consequences, not getting a b-day gift sounds like a fair consequence since she can\u2019t replace the blender herself.", "I\u2019m surprised at the Y T As. She broke a $600 machine, doing exactly what she was told not to. That\u2019s pretty disrespectful. And hard to argue was an an accident. Seems like there were bigger problems then a blender here. NTA", "The kettle was an honest mistake. The blender was her trying to prove you wrong. She gambled and lost. Since she didn't automatically and apologetically replace it, NTA for doing it yourself.\n\nHer passive aggressive actions upon delivery tells you a few extra details about her maturity OP.", "NTA. Your gf did *exactly* what she was told not to do and she ruined your blender.  She owed you a blender and *she* should have replaced it, not you.", "What did the gf say when you asked why she disassembled them blender after you specifically told her not to because the instructions told her it wasn\u2019t made to be disassembled? \n\nShe owes you the replacement cost and a big apology for breaking your shit AND ignoring your direction not to eff up your shit. But you messed up by being petty the way you sought to correct this wrong. \n\nESH.", "NTA wait she didn\u2019t offer to pay you back for the second appliance she broke after being warned?Also you took her out to dinner so it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t get her anything. She is being very unreasonable", "ESH-- Girlfriend did something she was explicitly told not to do. Discuss it, work out a fix or move on.\n\nBut telling her she's not getting a gift because of her action is petty. Tells me that instead of having an adult discussion, you two are being passive aggressive over this.", "NTA. I'm sure you hadn't been forced to spend a surprise $600, you'd have gotten her a great gift. And you still took her out so she still came out on top.", "She did what you said not to do, after getting upset with you for telling her not to? Yeah, she should have paid for a replacement- this is her fault. Would I have used her birthday to settle scores? High risk move, but NTA.", "Info: Why is your girlfriend washing your blender in the first place? Its extremely important to clean a blender immediately after using by running it with soapy water. If you don't clean it immediately, the food bits will harden on and get mould and other nastyness in places that are impossible to reach.", "NTA although It is a little rude to say what you said but not as rude as going against someone\u2019s wishes on an expensive appliance. Is she a total clean freak or something? Like she couldn\u2019t help herself but disassemble it anyway\u2026 I think it would\u2019ve been better to say something like \u201cI emailed customer support they won\u2019t refund it so how can we replace it?\u201d", "ESH, her part is obvious, your part is using her birthday as your chance to get her for being an AH. You are adults. Deal with your disagreements like adults. She's responsible for replacing the blender (and I bet I know what blender it is) but her birthday is not related to that.", "NTA. Personally I would dump someone who was this stupid.", "Yeah NTA. I would be livid. And since she doesn\u2019t have a job, she can\u2019t replace it so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I bet she won\u2019t fuck around with any other appliances. Also, she needs to get a job.", "ESH. She should have been *way* more responsible and not taken apart the blender. She did exactly what you asked her not to do. She also should replace it for you since it sounds like you don't share finances and she's the one who broke it - for the *second* time. But did you really have to use it against her on her birthday?", "NTA. She was told to not take it apart and did exactly that.", "INFO: Did you ask your gf to replace the blender when she broke it? Or did you just decide her birthday present would be the replacement?", "ESH  \n\n\nObviously mistakes happen, and, she should still be responsible for helping replace the blender. I can't speak to why she did that.\n\nHowever, birthdays should not be used to \"teach a lesson.\"", "ESH. If you want her to reimburse you for the expensive blender, ask her to do that. Don't \"punish\" her by getting yourself a replacement as \"her\" birthday present. \n\nIf she paid you back and you turned right around and spent that amount of money on her gift, that wouldn't be rude. What you did is.", "ESH. She should have listened to you and then offered to pay for it when she broke it, but you weren't right to frame her birthday as an opportunity to punish her or get back at her for it.\n\nIf this happened weeks ago, you should have resolved it like adults instead of using her birthday to rub her nose in it.", "Nta, but maybe a tiny tiny bit. Lol\n\nHonestly..\nI'd be the one extremely pissed at her.\nAnd yeah I would of felt so bad .. I think I would of just said 'forget my birthday this year I'm sorry, and I'll make this up to you'.\n.. like.. no.. maybe get her a 30 or 40 dollar gift card somewhere with a card but thats it.\nI'd be livid.\nYou explained to her NOT to do that.\nLike what's wrong with her to not u derstand that. It says it IN the Instructions. And it wasn't a 30 dollar kettle.. 600 dollar fricken blender I mean come on.", "No, it sounds like you need to get rid of the girlfriend.  She obviously is unable or unwilling to accept responsibility for her own actions.  Which is a huge red flag in a relationship. NTA", "Tough one but gotta go with YTA. Would have been better to get her a small gift and tell her that your budget was limited because of the blender.", "ESH.\n\nHer for litteraly bypassing direct instructions.\n\nYou for choosing one of the worst possible moment in the year to do so.", "NTA\n\nI'm shocked that she didn't offer to replace it immediately upon breaking it. Hopefully she's not one of those people for whom birthdays are sacred, worship-me days.", "ESH\n\nYep, she did what you told her not to and broke it.  Asshole move.\n\nYep, you decided your girlfriends birthday was the time to punish her for doing that.  Asshole move.", "I'm in camp esh, her much more than you.  Although I don't think you should get her nothing,  I think it's fair you're not gonna get her something expensive since you're the one replacing a very expensive appliance she broke.  \nI think a small token or nice dinner would suffice.", "ESH. \n\nHer more than you. She deliberately did something you explicitly told her not to and you explained why she shouldn\u2019t. And she did it anyways. Really not cool. \n\nIt\u2019s her birthday. Not the day to make a point. You should have just asked her to buy you a new one since she broke it. \n\nYou do realize she\u2019s going to \u201cclean\u201d your new blender right?", "ESH\n\nMore importantly why can\u2019t this $600 blender be thoroughly cleaned? Maybe I\u2019m not understanding this well.", "NTA- you warned her not to take it apart per instructions from the manufacturer.  She already made a similar mistake and fully remembers that mistake.   You didn\u2019t completely ignore her birthday just used the allocated money to replace what she broke.   \n\nYou may want to keep a close eye on kitchen appliances.  She has ignored common sense twice in the name of cleaning so it may be more of a compulsion to with see how things work or extreme OCD.", "ESH. She was immature and the fact that she broke your things after specific unstructions is fucked up. However; if you feel the need tocuse her birthday to get a new one for yourself shows you're not very mature yourself. Have an adult conversation about why you're upset, and if she can't react appropriately, you shouldn't be dating.", "No, she seems like an airhead or decided she knew better than the company or you. You were clear, and $600 isn't a cheap blender. She got what she deserved. \n\nNTA.", "It sounds like she will have to move out at some point so she should get a job NOW. \n\nNTA", "I think OP has to make it more clear to people your gf doesn't have a job since a lot are saying for hee to replace it.", "Esh. You shouldn\u2019t be using her birthday to make a point. She shouldn\u2019t have taken apart the blender. \n\nLook up a YouTube video on how to reassemble it, seriously how much money do you make to feel fine throwing away over a thousand dollars on blenders", "Seriously, buying yourself a gift for your girlfriend's birthday to punish her for being a jack wagon? I understand being upset, she disregarded the maintenance instructions for an expensive blender. And if she had the sense she was born with she should have offered to replace it.  However, someone's birthday is not the time to make a point. I don't think your relationship will last with this dynamic but for the time being ESH.", "I don't know if you have the moral high ground but am pretty sure you no longer have a girlfriend.

Perhaps you should have opted for the one that runs 29.99 at Walmart", "Honestly, kinda YTA.  Yes, she essentially broke your very expensive blender and should be responsible for replacing it but you shouldn't use her birthday as a way to force her to do so.  You should get her a real birthday present but still request she replace the blender she broke", "ESH\n\nYes girlfriend screwed up again but that doesn\u2019t mean you should skimp on a present and remind her of her dumb mistake on her birthday. Girlfriend should not overestimated her own ability and do stuff that\u2019s beyond herself, like disassemble blender and assume she can fix it back despite a 100% track record of failing. Instead of replacing the spoilt blender as a reasonable person will, she left it to you to replace and let the 3rd one be stolen despite able to collect it. \n\nMaybe consider finding someone else with her personality, I won\u2019t be surprised if she decided to leave the door open and let you both be robbed when you have another stupid argument again", "ESH. She shouldn't have tried to prove you -- and the blender instructions -- wrong. You should have found a way to address that with her which had nothing to do with her birthday.", "Idk ESH? Are you being petty? Yes. Is your gf in the wrong for literally doing what you told her NOT to do? Also yes. Communication is KEY my friend. Talk to her and set a boundary.", "YTA. You basically punished your girlfriend for her birthday. \n\nNot only did you not get her a gift, but you took the time to bring up her failure, and on top of it, you essentially said your own expensive blender was the thing that was most important.\n\nSure it sucks that she broke your blender but don't use a birthday as a means to get back at her. Work out something where she replaces it, like normal adults.", "ESH, but mostly you. Your girlfriend can't be trusted around appliances, but you ruined her birthday in a cruel way. You could have picked any other day to buy yourself a gift to prove your point, but you chose to do it on her birthday. Nothing for her, just for yourself. You really have to ask if you're an AH?", "Oh, c'mon, OP, of course YTA for doing this on HER birthday. My personal belief is to never use birthdays or holidays to \"teach a lesson\" or punish someone. Yes, she did break it, but she should've replaced it. But you're the asshole for putting it in her face like this on her birthday.", "BS", "So she didn't really get dinner or a gift on her actual bday. \n\nESH.", "NTA", "NTA, but please note: saying, \u201cI\u2019m spending an unexpected $600 because the blender is broken so dinner is your gift this year.\u201d Might have been better than, \u201cI\u2019m buying the blender for myself for your birthday because you didn\u2019t listen and broke my other one.\u201d Are two very different ways of saying the same thing. Using the latter will cause way more relationship conflict than the former.", "ESH", "You\u2019re not wrong, but YTA.", "YTA. Come on that's petty af. You need to grow up.", "YTA.\n\nI mean, she shouldn\u2019t have stuffed your blender, and she should have replaced it\u2026 but her birthday is not how you \u201cfix\u201d this. I\u2019d be surprised if you still have a girlfriend by the end of the day.", "YTA.  For all the reasons others get into, but also, and importantly, it sounds like she didn't break the blender, she broke the vessel, which can be replaced for a lot less than $600 ($170 or less), or you can just replace the blade assembly in the vessel you have (under $75) AND not on her birthday with aim of shaming and punishing her.", "YTA\n\nshe made a mistake... stop buying $600 blenders... as long as it doesn't act like a spaceship in addition to blending the food you're paying about $500 too much", "NTA. You deserve a new blender on your girlfriend\u2019s birthday!!", "Giant, giant YTA\n\nThe. Actual. Fuck. I\u2019ll be surprised if she doesn\u2019t break up with you. \n\n\nThere is a time and a place my friend, and her birthday is not the time nor the place to do something like that. Yes, it was her fault the blender was broken and yes you should have set up something for her to pay you back the cost and you could get another one.\n\nWhat you did is just beyond. \n\nUgh - just look at yourself and think for a minute.", "YTA.  It\u2019s her birthday. This was not a good time to talk about the blender. Yes go to get her a birthday gift and explain that you didn\u2019t think it through.

For one, you\u2019re an asshole for spending $600 on a blender. You can get the same one referb for much much less.\n\nTwo, who the fuck uses someone\u2019s birthday present as a weapon to teach them a lesson about reading instructions? You don\u2019t need to teach lessons like this to adults period - either accept your girlfriend for who she is or move on.\n\nThree, your story is fake as shit. If the blades were disassembled that simply takes place on the container. If you needed a new container you replace that part, not the whole fucking blender.", "YTA! it seems like you are really holding this against her. maybe just insist on washing your own appliances.", "YTA. Clean your own damn $600 blender.", "Yes, YTA, and yes, you better buy her a gift and drop the pettiness, at least until you both get some perspective and chill a bit.", "Let me get this right, she\u2019s ruined more than one thing and an expensive thing after you told her not to take it apart. And she doesn\u2019t work? But you think you should get her a gift from Tiffany\u2019s? Is the sex that good???", "First of all, who TF buys a $600 blender? Are you a chef? That\u2019s a little nuts in today\u2019s economy. Yes, she was in the wrong for breaking it and the 2 of you should have worked out something for her to replace it.
