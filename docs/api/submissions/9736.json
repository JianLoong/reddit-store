We have lived together for one year now and I believe we have a wonderful relationship.\n\nAbout eight months ago, my girlfriend tried to wash an electric kettle that I had. She essentially disassembled part of it to scrub it clean. It was a $30 kettle and I figured it was not a big deal because it was an honest mistake.\n\nFast forward four months. I bought a new blender for $600. It was something I had wanted for about a year, and I finally pulled the trigger and bought it. When I was reading the instruction manual, I saw that it said you should never attempt to disassemble or take it apart to better clean it. I told my girlfriend that under no circumstances should she try to remove any parts of it like she did the kettle. She got a bit upset that I brought that up, but I told her I was just using it as an example.\n\nThree weeks ago, my girlfriend did exactly what I told her not to. She removed part of the blender to \"get a better wash\" on the blades, couldn't reassemble it, and then put all the tiny parts in a bag. I tried to reassemble it myself and failed as well. Then I emailed their customer support, who essentially responded with \"You should have read the instructions.\" I did but... yeah. \n\nYesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, and I told her that instead of getting her a gift this year, I would be buying myself a new blender. She was furious. I did take her out to a nice dinner a couple of nights before that. My girlfriend didn't even bother to open the door when the delivery guy came to drop it off, leaving it open to porch pirates stealing it. When I asked why she didn't even try she just shrugged.\n\nI don't know if I should be going to Tiffany's to get something to apologize or if I was being reasonable here.

Look, I think punishing someone on their birthday is unkind but it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t do anything for her birthday, you still took her out on a nice dinner. It looks like people are complaining that you\u2019re punishing her for a mistake, but this doesn\u2019t feel like a mistake to me, she broke the blender after doing something she was specifically told not to do. $600 for a blender is a steep price for a kitchen appliance imo, and your girlfriend was specifically told NOT to disassemble it and did it anyways. Then when you replaced the blender she broke, she didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to bring it inside. Actions have consequences, not getting a b-day gift sounds like a fair consequence since she can\u2019t replace the blender herself.", "I\u2019m surprised at the Y T As.

Since she didn't automatically and apologetically replace it, NTA for doing it yourself.\n\nHer passive aggressive actions upon delivery tells you a few extra details about her maturity OP.", "NTA. Your gf did *exactly* what she was told not to do and she ruined your blender.  She owed you a blender and *she* should have replaced it, not you.", "What did the gf say when you asked why she disassembled them blender after you specifically told her not to because the instructions told her it wasn\u2019t made to be disassembled? \n\nShe owes you the replacement cost and a big apology for breaking your shit AND ignoring your direction not to eff up your shit. But you messed up by being petty the way you sought to correct this wrong. \n\nESH.", "NTA wait she didn\u2019t offer to pay you back for the second appliance she broke after being warned?Also you took her out to dinner so it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t get her anything. She is being very unreasonable", "ESH-- Girlfriend did something she was explicitly told not to do. Discuss it, work out a fix or move on.\n\nBut telling her she's not getting a gift because of her action is petty. Tells me that instead of having an adult discussion, you two are being passive aggressive over this.", "NTA. I'm sure you hadn't been forced to spend a surprise $600, you'd have gotten her a great gift. And you still took her out so she still came out on top.", "She did what you said not to do, after getting upset with you for telling her not to? Yeah, she should have paid for a replacement- this is her fault. Would I have used her birthday to settle scores? High risk move, but NTA.", "Info: Why is your girlfriend washing your blender in the first place? Its extremely important to clean a blender immediately after using by running it with soapy water. If you don't clean it immediately, the food bits will harden on and get mould and other nastyness in places that are impossible to reach.", "NTA although It is a little rude to say what you said but not as rude as going against someone\u2019s wishes on an expensive appliance. Is she a total clean freak or something? Like she couldn\u2019t help herself but disassemble it anyway\u2026 I think it would\u2019ve been better to say something like \u201cI emailed customer support they won\u2019t refund it so how can we replace it?\u201d", "ESH, her part is obvious, your part is using her birthday as your chance to get her for being an AH. You are adults. Deal with your disagreements like adults. She's responsible for replacing the blender (and I bet I know what blender it is) but her birthday is not related to that.", "NTA. Personally I would dump someone who was this stupid.", "Yeah NTA. I would be livid. And since she doesn\u2019t have a job, she can\u2019t replace it so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I bet she won\u2019t fuck around with any other appliances. Also, she needs to get a job.", "ESH. She should have been *way* more responsible and not taken apart the blender. She did exactly what you asked her not to do. She also should replace it for you since it sounds like you don't share finances and she's the one who broke it - for the *second* time. But did you really have to use it against her on her birthday?", "NTA. She was told to not take it apart and did exactly that.", "INFO: Did you ask your gf to replace the blender when she broke it? Or did you just decide her birthday present would be the replacement?", "ESH  \n\n\nObviously mistakes happen, and, she should still be responsible for helping replace the blender. I can't speak to why she did that.\n\nHowever, birthdays should not be used to \"teach a lesson.\"", "ESH. If you want her to reimburse you for the expensive blender, ask her to do that. Don't \"punish\" her by getting yourself a replacement as \"her\" birthday present. \n\nIf she paid you back and you turned right around and spent that amount of money on her gift, that wouldn't be rude. What you did is.", "ESH. She should have listened to you and then offered to pay for it when she broke it, but you weren't right to frame her birthday as an opportunity to punish her or get back at her for it.\n\nIf this happened weeks ago, you should have resolved it like adults instead of using her birthday to rub her nose in it.", "Nta, but maybe a tiny tiny bit. Lol\n\nHonestly..\nI'd be the one extremely pissed at her.\nAnd yeah I would of felt so bad .. I think I would of just said 'forget my birthday this year I'm sorry, and I'll make this up to you'.\n.. like.. no.. maybe get her a 30 or 40 dollar gift card somewhere with a card but thats it.\nI'd be livid.\nYou explained to her NOT to do that.\nLike what's wrong with her to not u derstand that. It says it IN the Instructions. And it wasn't a 30 dollar kettle.. 600 dollar fricken blender I mean come on.", "No, it sounds like you need to get rid of the girlfriend.  She obviously is unable or unwilling to accept responsibility for her own actions.  Which is a huge red flag in a relationship. NTA", "Tough one but gotta go with YTA. Would have been better to get her a small gift and tell her that your budget was limited because of the blender.", "ESH.\n\nHer for litteraly bypassing direct instructions.\n\nYou for choosing one of the worst possible moment in the year to do so.", "NTA\n\nI'm shocked that she didn't offer to replace it immediately upon breaking it. Hopefully she's not one of those people for whom birthdays are sacred, worship-me days.", "ESH\n\nYep, she did what you told her not to and broke it.  Asshole move.\n\nYep, you decided your girlfriends birthday was the time to punish her for doing that.  Asshole move.", "I'm in camp esh, her much more than you.  Although I don't think you should get her nothing,  I think it's fair you're not gonna get her something expensive since you're the one replacing a very expensive appliance she broke.  \nI think a small token or nice dinner would suffice.", "ESH. \n\nHer more than you. She deliberately did something you explicitly told her not to and you explained why she shouldn\u2019t. And she did it anyways. Really not cool. \n\nIt\u2019s her birthday. Not the day to make a point. You should have just asked her to buy you a new one since she broke it. \n\nYou do realize she\u2019s going to \u201cclean\u201d your new blender right?", "ESH\n\nMore importantly why can\u2019t this $600 blender be thoroughly cleaned? Maybe I\u2019m not understanding this well.", "NTA- you warned her not to take it apart per instructions from the manufacturer.  She already made a similar mistake and fully remembers that mistake.   You didn\u2019t completely ignore her birthday just used the allocated money to replace what she broke.   \n\nYou may want to keep a close eye on kitchen appliances.  She has ignored common sense twice in the name of cleaning so it may be more of a compulsion to with see how things work or extreme OCD.", "ESH. She was immature and the fact that she broke your things after specific unstructions is fucked up. However; if you feel the need tocuse her birthday to get a new one for yourself shows you're not very mature yourself. Have an adult conversation about why you're upset, and if she can't react appropriately, you shouldn't be dating.", "No, she seems like an airhead or decided she knew better than the company or you. You were clear, and $600 isn't a cheap blender. She got what she deserved. \n\nNTA.", "It sounds like she will have to move out at some point so she should get a job NOW. \n\nNTA", "I think OP has to make it more clear to people your gf doesn't have a job since a lot are saying for hee to replace it.", "Esh. You shouldn\u2019t be using her birthday to make a point. She shouldn\u2019t have taken apart the blender. \n\nLook up a YouTube video on how to reassemble it, seriously how much money do you make to feel fine throwing away over a thousand dollars on blenders", "Seriously, buying yourself a gift for your girlfriend's birthday to punish her for being a jack wagon? I understand being upset, she disregarded the maintenance instructions for an expensive blender. And if she had the sense she was born with she should have offered to replace it.  However, someone's birthday is not the time to make a point. I don't think your relationship will last with this dynamic but for the time being ESH.", "I don't know if you have the moral high ground but am pretty sure you no longer have a girlfriend.

Perhaps you should have opted for the one that runs 29.99 at Walmart", "Honestly, kinda YTA.  Yes, she essentially broke your very expensive blender and should be responsible for replacing it but you shouldn't use her birthday as a way to force her to do so.  You should get her a real birthday present but still request she replace the blender she broke", "ESH\n\nYes girlfriend screwed up again but that doesn\u2019t mean you should skimp on a present and remind her of her dumb mistake on her birthday. Girlfriend should not overestimated her own ability and do stuff that\u2019s beyond herself, like disassemble blender and assume she can fix it back despite a 100% track record of failing. Instead of replacing the spoilt blender as a reasonable person will, she left it to you to replace and let the 3rd one be stolen despite able to collect it. \n\nMaybe consider finding someone else with her personality, I won\u2019t be surprised if she decided to leave the door open and let you both be robbed when you have another stupid argument again", "ESH. She shouldn't have tried to prove you -- and the blender instructions -- wrong. You should have found a way to address that with her which had nothing to do with her birthday.", "Idk ESH? Are you being petty? Yes. Is your gf in the wrong for literally doing what you told her NOT to do? Also yes. Communication is KEY my friend. Talk to her and set a boundary.", "YTA. You basically punished your girlfriend for her birthday. \n\nNot only did you not get her a gift, but you took the time to bring up her failure, and on top of it, you essentially said your own expensive blender was the thing that was most important.\n\nSure it sucks that she broke your blender but don't use a birthday as a means to get back at her. Work out something where she replaces it, like normal adults.", "ESH, but mostly you. Your girlfriend can't be trusted around appliances, but you ruined her birthday in a cruel way. You could have picked any other day to buy yourself a gift to prove your point, but you chose to do it on her birthday. Nothing for her, just for yourself. You really have to ask if you're an AH?", "Oh, c'mon, OP, of course YTA for doing this on HER birthday. My personal belief is to never use birthdays or holidays to \"teach a lesson\" or punish someone. Yes, she did break it, but she should've replaced it. But you're the asshole for putting it in her face like this on her birthday.", "BS", "So she didn't really get dinner or a gift on her actual bday. \n\nESH.", "NTA", "NTA, but please note: saying, \u201cI\u2019m spending an unexpected $600 because the blender is broken so dinner is your gift this year.\u201d Might have been better than, \u201cI\u2019m buying the blender for myself for your birthday because you didn\u2019t listen and broke my other one.\u201d Are two very different ways of saying the same thing.

For all the reasons others get into, but also, and importantly, it sounds like she didn't break the blender, she broke the vessel, which can be replaced for a lot less than $600 ($170 or less), or you can just replace the blade assembly in the vessel you have (under $75) AND not on her birthday with aim of shaming and punishing her.", "YTA\n\nshe made a mistake... stop buying $600 blenders... as long as it doesn't act like a spaceship in addition to blending the food you're paying about $500 too much", "NTA.

It\u2019s her birthday. This was not a good time to talk about the blender. Yes go to get her a birthday gift and explain that you didn\u2019t think it through.

I can\u2019t tell if she did it on purpose or is just kinda dumb or what but why exactly are you two together?  \n\nAlso this sounds like a Vitamix. She should have read the manual before using it - cleaning it just requires blending soapy water and new models even have a cleaning button. It would require a lot of messing around to disassemble the blade. I have one - you would know right away you were doing something bad if you attempted to take it apart. It would just be so obvious. Again, I don\u2019t want to assign intent to her actions, but did you show her how to use it? Or give her the manual? Is she generally this clueless or only with your appliances? It\u2019s time for a serious discussion, friend. This isn\u2019t how healthy couples handle conflict.", "Honestly sounds like it should be an ex-girlfriend. \n\nWhile framing it as her present is a jerk move, I also get it.

There's no need for revenge if you don't play like partners anymore. You would be TA if it were your beloved girlfriend. Because you are supposed to make the birthday special for someone you love, not collect debts. But it's hard to blame you, because her actions are unjustifiable.", "NTA. She broke an expensive item that you purchased despite you asking her not to take it apart to clean it. I\u2019m going to assume she didn\u2019t offer to replace it either.  I know the kettle was a mistake but breaking the blender then intentionally leaving the new one you ordered outside allowing the risk of it being stolen just screams she doesn\u2019t respect you or your property.  I think ultimately you two need to have a serious conversation about why she\u2019s done what she\u2019s done & perhaps re evaluate the relationship.", "YTA. Buying yourself a new blender is totally justified. Your money, your blender, and her fuckup. She was TA for being petty and trying to prove you wrong.\n\nThat said, limited to this situation, YTA. Yeah, she messed up and that should be remedied, but specifically telling her you\u2019re getting something for you, for HER birthday, is a dick move. You\u2019re just matching her pettiness with your own. Just break up and be done with it.", "Was the nice dinner specifically for her birthday and you paid? If so, nta. \nYou gave her that gift and that's all you could afford bc you had to replace the blender and she won't have to. \n\nAll sounds reasonable to me.", "NTA\n\nHer birthday gift is that she didn\u2019t have to spend $600 replacing the blender.", "NTA. she either broke it on purpose, or is a complete moron. Either way, in order to replace it he can no longer afford to get her a birthday gift. Seems fair to me and honestly he should just break up with her. The childishness behaviour of not accepting the delivery is just the final straw for me", "ESH - you don't punish people you love like that even though what she did really sucks. \n\nYou ask them to reimburse you for the accident, and if they can't or won't, you have to move on. \n\nThis is not a hill to die on.", "NTA\n\nBuy something from Tiffany\u2019s and then chuck it in a blender", "YTA why is your girlfriend the one cleaning your stuff when it's so valuable to you?", "ESH.\n\nShe's at fault for disassembling the blender.\nYou're at fault for punishing her over it.", "NTA, your gf needs to listen and not destroy your things. Once is an accident, but twice...?", "NTA", "On one hand ruining her birthday seems a little harsh. On the other hand she shouldn't have done what u said not to do. I think maybe try treating her like a human being and if you can't get along don't date her. From what u said here it sounds like you are treating her like a small child. Both of you need better communication and to act like adults.", "It's a little petty to do it on her bday but no, NTA. She did that on purpose. You should really consider not dating someone who acts like this.", "NTA - Be careful, she might take the blender apart again", "YTA-You should have NOT dealt with this on her birthday. Thinking you have to teach your partner a lesson is a slippery slope and a bit sinister. You should have asked to be reimbursed for any monetary loss of course but waiting for her birthday to carry out your plan is sus. I would have said ETA except the fact that you got your little revenge on her birthday makes you definitely a AH!", "NTA.\n\nYou drew a clear line, she crossed it.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nIt's not clear whether porch pirates did end up stealing the second blender but if they did that means just by being petty, she wasted 1200$ out of YOUR hard earned money. That's an amount of money that I personally haven't yet seen firsthand in my 21 years of living and it's an amount no one person should lose over something like that.", "NTA. also the fact she would leave it outside KNOWING it could get stolen is a red flag ,seems like she likes doing whatever she wants even if told otherwise.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to suffer again for your GF\u2019s mistakes, and you bought her dinner lots of times as stated I think it\u2019s fair enough?", "ESH\n\nThis thing you\u2019re describing is not a wonderful relationship. These are the actions of two individuals with each their own issues,or a couple with issues.", "So, NO one is going to acknowledge how dumb this 25 year grown up woman is?\n\nam i the only one who s concerned about her mental state?\n\nNTA\n\nplease send her to school she need re-education.", "NTA. I Wish my husband got \u201cforgive me\u201d gifts for me from Tiffany\u2019s though lol. Anyway, she did exactly what you told her not to, broke a second piece of kitchen equipment despite her experience with the kettle and your explicit instructions not to do it. Maybe let her know that if she buys you a replacement for $600, you\u2019ll be able to buy her a birthday gift. The kettle was an accident, the blender was just being stubborn and irresponsible.", "NTA. What\u2019s gonna happen if you two marry and have kids?

You did this because you did not follow the directions or heed my very clear warning. I expect you to replace it. \n\n2) You have a birthday coming up. I would be willing to consider replacing the blender as your birthday gift if that\u2019s something that would be okay with you instead of a gift.\n\n3) If not, when can you start repaying me as I need a replacement.\n\nInstead of asking how the repayment/replacement would go you just decided. That\u2019s not a good foundation of communication for a relationship. You should have explained what you wanted and needed to happen (replacement) and then offered that as an option ahead of time. Most people would jump at that because it\u2019s incredibly generous of you to offer to eat that cost as a gift. Some people don\u2019t like to be boxed in to decisions like that and need options as stupid as that sounds. \n\nYour girlfriend is an asshole for breaking your blender.

It only bred further resentment without resolving the fight.\n\nShe\u2019s dead wrong for disrespecting your wishes and damaging such an expensive purchase. Therefore, you should have told her to pay for a new one when she broke the blender 3 weeks ago. Maybe you could have agreed on a repayment plan if she couldn\u2019t pay in full. \nInstead, you took her out before her birthday and waited until the actual day to spring this on her. That\u2019s cold, calculated revenge which probably made you feel better but caused a grudge to build that\u2019s likely to seep into other areas of your relationship. \n\nIt appears you two have some underlying issues and these fights are symptoms of that. Consider working on them because this tit for tat method of conflict resolution is mean spirited & only makes things worse.", "ESH- she\u2019s TA for deliberately taking it apart after you specifically told her not to, and then not replacing it herself for you. But you\u2019re also TA for waiting to replace it until her birthday. That\u2019s a tad petty and could\u2019ve been done on literally any of the other 364 days of the year. Punishing her on her birthday isn\u2019t the way to go- guaranteed she\u2019s going to remember this and bring it up every year on the day. Is that really a path worth going down?", "YTA.

You are far too old to be this childish.", "ESH, mostly your GF tho. You could have just replaced your blender literally any other time and simply told her that she was not going to get a present this year. Instead you made it almost like hijacking her birthday, which sucks a little bit. And also, your GF seems a tad immature (I base this off how she reacted to your warning not to disassemble the blender, how she acted on her birthday, how she acted when the blender was delivered\u2026). If she is otherwise a good partner than it\u2019s ok that she is acting a bit immature, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she is toxic, but after things calm down, you should circle back and have a talk about her behaviors here.", "You should have gotten her a birthday gift. . .

She needs to be the one to be contacting the company and ordering a replacement part or finding a small appliance repair center or paying to replace it. They do repair most appliances over $600 and most blender containers are replaceable because the glass or acrylic can get cracked. Or, you should have insisted she buy a replacement when she broke it. The conflict and resolution needed to happen when the blender broke where she buys/starts to save for a replacement, or you forgive and forget. Instead you drew it out four months and punished her on her birthday.\n\nAdding that vitamix is the only blender I know of that both runs in that price range and has a base you don\u2019t take apart. [Vitamix definitely makes replacement pitchers.](https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/ascent-series-accessories) They also service all blenders that aren\u2019t more than 20 years old.

She was a jerk for breaking your blender after you'd explicitly showed her the user manual. She was a jerk for not offering to replace it when the warranty was denied. But you were a little bit of a jerk for handling it passively aggressively. It would have been cleaner and more productive to talk directly about it at the time and not mix it up with her birthday. Telling her how angry you were, how upsetting it was that she was so deliberately destructive and how strongly you feel that she should replace the blender for you- all of that would have been a good honest fight. See if you can have that kind of good honest fight now because at this point it's more about the relationship than the blender. (And is there even a wee chance she has OCD. There's something very peculiar about breaking two things in a row in a fit of cleaning.)", "ESH\n\nYou could have bought her a present, but you had to replace what she broke by doing exactly what she was told not to do.
