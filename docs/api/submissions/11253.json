Nico was wearing a fitness activity tracker (i.e. not a toy, not a watch, not jewellery). The primary purpose of it is to be worn all the time and especially during physical activity, to track total daily steps and encourage more activity and fitness. Before it disappeared from your school custody, he had been wearing it every day to school and during his soccer, basketball and all extra-curricular activities without any problems. While I respect the right of the sensei to request he remove it, sensei or whoever he passed it to is obligated to keep it safe until it is returned to Nico. That didn't happen, so why do you think it's fair that we his parents have to pay half the cost to replace something that was safely attached to Nico's wrist last time we saw it? Nico didn't lose it, elysian school staff removed it from him and failed to keep it safe until  returning it to him.

Of course there are downsides to everything but it doesn\u2019t make it right that this property was lost and they won\u2019t pay to replace it.", "I\u2019ve worked in schools for years. Yes, kids bring distracting things to school all the time and teachers may need to take them temporarily to have the student focus\u2026but it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s responsibility to keep that item safe and return it. \n\nYou\u2019re bringing up an entirely different issue and not addressing the one posted. As a teacher, do you keep track of the things you take from your students? I did. Had a locked drawer for them.", "Your post misses the point. The kid was told the tracker was not allowed. The sensie removed, lost it. The parents should be reimbursed the full cost.", "this sounds like such a made up problem. i highly doubt fitness trackers are so popular with kids a 5 year old is doing laps in your class to reach his goal.", "This is an absolutely ludicrous statement to make.", "This whole thing sounds like a great ED path for so many. As someone who developed an ED young...yikes", "You\u2019re a teacher? Your comprehension sucks.", "my god, and i thought i was being too obsessive and im freaking in my 40s!", "I really wouldn't. But if the kid is left in charge of the tracker, it's not the school's responsibility. The moment the teacher took it, the school was required to return it. ETA: as I recall from my karate days, no shoes on the mat. So at the very least, the kid should have been told to put it in his shoes until the lesson was over.", "This. Exactly this.", "Is it theft legally though? There was no evidence of deception or physical coercion or anything like that here unless OP is leaving it out. Businesses are allowed to say \"you can't wear jewelry while we provide this service for safety reasons\" and they are allowed to put it to the side for safe keeping. You are free to refuse and sit to the side or leave if you don't like it. If you are just flat out leaving your kid in the care of someone, that also implies you are granting some level of supervision and control to them.\n\nPersonally I would say if you don't trust a kid to make that decision with the thing, then they shouldn't have it at all. It's quite possible OP could win in small claims court or something though. The school is also in the wrong in that they should not seize things if they aren't capable of safe-guarding them.\n\nJust because they may be found in a court to be liable for the cost of replacement does not mean they are guilty for the crime of theft though. If it turns out an employee had pawned the item, that would be different because it would suggest that it wasn't an accident.", "Definitely should have, but also should have been left at home in the first place.", "No, the fact that you felt the need to show off your japanese for absolutely no reason makes you a weeb.", "Once the teacher took it, they took full responsibility for its care. The child had no control over what happened to the tracker at that point, so they have no responsibility. The phone analogy is a good one. If a teacher confiscated a phone, then lost it, they are responsible to replace what they lost, regardless of why they took it away.", "I\u2019m not 100% sure it was a prohibited item, though, as OP mentioned they haven\u2019t seen the rule posted anywhere or heard that it was a fixed rule, including when speaking to the school about the event. It ABSOLUTELY should be a fixed rule for no jewelry/watches, but the burden of setting the rules is on the school. If they just say they prefer something not be done or that they\u2019re generally not in favor of something, thats not the same as it being prohibited.", "Except it isn't split responsibility the second the sensai got possession of it.\n\nHe could of told him to put it in his bag so it wasn't an issue, or to place it somewhere secure so that they both knew were it was.\n\nAlso that's essentially punishing the kid for the parents which is dumb", "No. The teacher could have called his parents and informed them about the situation, or asked for him to be picked up for going against dress code. That would have been an appropriate lesson for the situation. The moment they *take* a child's possesion, it is their responsibility to keep it safe. The staff failed to do so, and lost it.\n\n They should not be taking things from students if they do not have lockers, or an office for them to stay in safely. She should be reimbursed fully, and I agree with the others implying theft.", "Just because he wore it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s responsible for it being lost. I can\u2019t believe what some people are saying. As a professional adult, you should absolutely keep track of valuable items you confiscate. If you lose it irresponsibly, that\u2019s 100% on you", "Who are you to decide what their child needs or does not need? And how does that absolve the instructor of his responsibility to not loose something taken from a child? You take something from a child, you are responsible for it period. Not half of it, the whole thing.", "Same with the sensai yet he took it instead of asking him to put it in his bag, or tell him he can't participate that week.\n\nBoth makes more sense for a karate class when karate is one of the martial arts most focused on self improvement a person.\n\nWhat's a better lesson for a 6 year old, that rules are strict and you have to follow them or there are consequences by getting told you can participate for 1 week \n\nOr that peoole can just take your shit and not give it back just because they have a position of authority, that's how you get kids who have authority.", "Sorry to inform you, but you\u2019ve been to some VERY poor dojos then. It\u2019s a hard rule at any serious one: no parents hovering around (they\u2019re welcome to wait outside). It\u2019s a huge distraction for the kids", "I've never seen a studio like this, so I think your experience is very regional or maybe very high level.", "Weird comment. Most karate schools and studios (particularly the ones that mostly just teach kids) have parents drop their kids off and pick them up after. I\u2019ve rarely seen parents waiting there the entire time, even if it\u2019s not against any rules.", "Dw bout it", "Doesn't matter if the kid gave it or it was taken.

They should replace it.", "I would have already called the cops to report it stolen.", "What does ED stand for? \ud83e\udd14 It means something not kid related to me?", "I\u2019m 31 and have had to turn off these functions on my Apple Watch because I started doing laps of my house to get the steps at fkn 11pm\u2026", "This is it right here. It was the kid's to keep track of.", "Depends... my kid karate classes were non-contact and only hanging jewelry was prohibited. Jujitsu I would agree but I think it depends on the class. I wouldn't be surprised if OP was told no jewelry but even if they were it isn't an excuse to lose an item...", "I mean yeah bit the second the sensai had that watch in his possession he took responsibly yet isn't paying for it.\n\nIt doesn't matter at all that it should of been left at home, a simple you can't work out while wearing the watch and telling them to miss a week would be better (assuming they didn't charge for the week they made him miss)\n\nBut taking a watch from the kids possession and then when you lose it not paying it back is scummy.\n\nI would much rather if I was the 6 year old to be told you miss 1 week, over losing a watch (that at age 6 is really exciting and is Like gods gift in a 6 year olds mind )", "Where did I say hovering around? The parents sit quietly and observe. Isn\u2019t that the case at your dojo?", "Could be, I do live in an area that is known for high level martial artists.", "That\u2019s never been the case for me. In the 15 years I\u2019ve been involved in martial arts, I have never been to a dojo that didn\u2019t have the majority of the kids with a parent there during practice. How many karate dojos have you gone to? And any parent, of any kid, in any sport, that doesn\u2019t keep an eye on how the coaches train their kid is a fool. How many stories of coaches molesting kids have you heard? But it doesn\u2019t even have to be that extreme. Just to blindly entrust your kid to the influence of a stranger is dumb", "Of course it matters. If I give you something for safekeeping, you don\u2019t offer me any kind of guarantee or warranty. You\u2019re not a safety deposit box. I take a calculated risk.\n\nIf OP has homeowners insurance, they likely have a rider that covers property stolen off-premises.

But this was a kid too young to remove it from his own wrist. In this case, the sensei or another responsible adult should put it somewhere for safekeeping exactly once and inform the parent at the end of the session that they need to remove it before practice.", "Yeah, I was just responding to her post that it's not a watch therefore not against the rules.  It totally still counts", "So, every parent that sends their kids to school is dumb? That's the basis of the entire educational system!", "I have my second degree black belt. Started as a child.

Are parents at fault for not following their kids there as well?", "If I took someone's phone for safekeeping, then dropped it in a lake or lost it, I am responsible for replacing it. By accepting or taking an item for safekeeping, I am agreeing to return it upon request in a similar condition to what I received it.

Who knows really...", "If they are not involved in the school they send their kid to, yes.", "Black belt in what? Do you encourage parents to just drop off kids at your dojo? The majority of parents are working while their kids are in school, not true when kids are practicing extracurricular activities. And if the parents are not involved in their kids school they are foolish there too. Let\u2019s be clear that I never claimed any fault. Those are your words not mine. Would you entrust your 6 year old to a stranger? Because being a coach doesn\u2019t make them automatically trustworthy.
