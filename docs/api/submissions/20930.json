You act like you're only allowed to talk to your own family at the wedding, grow up and get to know hers.", "Why are you guys individually talking to your families? You mentioned this a few times. The bride and groom generally go around together you weirdo", "While it is your wedding too, think about how she would feel not including important people in her life. Not to mention how left out those uninvited people would feel considering how close they are to your fiance.", "Um... No. Your wife will be there, your family will be there, her family that you're entering will be there, your friends will be there... How is that alone?\n\nYou seem very focused on the lopsided-ness of it all. Like some tit for tat BS. You really need to let that go. It doesn't matter who sits on what side of the aisle. What matters is having a great time celebrating your marriage. \n\nLet your fiancee have her family there. Go and have a great time. You're getting all worked up about the details and not looking at the big picture - you're getting married to a woman you love. If the financial aspect of more guests stresses you out, look at other methods of cutting costs (catering, flowers, etc.) to make you feel better about it.", "don\u2019t you realize the point of a wedding is to JOIN families? it\u2019s not a battle, dude. those people are important to her. if she is important to you, MEET THEM", "Do her a favor and break off the engagement. You\u2019re not even married and you\u2019re breaking promises.  You don\u2019t care about her family, and you don\u2019t sound comparable. \n\nHonestly the wedding only about the couple, if it was, everyone would just save the money and elope. The wedding is about sharing your life with you\u2019re family and friends. The marriage is about your love for each other.", "How are you going to be alone? Have you ever been to a wedding? The bride and groom normally greet their guests together, are you just not going to greether family with her? That would be really rude, and not indicative of someone who is willing to merge families.", "Is it really about the money, or the emotional disparity in how many of your family/friends will be on your side compared to hers? It would kinda hurt me if I only had a few guests while there are 100+ on my wife's.", "Do you not plan on spending time with your wife at your wedding\u2026", "I\u2019m atheist. Fianc\u00e9e is Catholic", "She\u2019s already agreed to not invite many relatives that are also important to her like the oversea family. Her getting 100% her way would be her inviting everyone in her family, which she agreed not to do", "Honestly, the vibe OP is giving off makes me think they might not even be able to \ud83d\ude02\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true but man, I wouldn\u2019t want to be there based off this", "Yall should see indian weddings, lol. My cousin just had 900+ guest wedding. 100 - 200 is hardly large IMO", "My cousin married an Egyptian man and I think it was 250 people plus, and that was considered small!", "EXACTLY, I don't understand why OP doesn't get this", "This. Going back on your word is not the best way to begin a marriage.", "We have an agreed upon budget and we also are in a comfortable position agreed that money isn\u2019t an issue, it\u2019s more about the principle I guess. I would rather spend more money on the venue and have a smaller attendance, for example, than a cheaper venue and a lengthy guest list.", "I\u2019d probably be fine with that. She wants the big ceremony and stuff", "Then she can pay the extra money, it's not fair for them to pay the same amount when she has way more guests", "*strangers to OP* will be there.\n\nA long line of introductions to 2nd cousins/aunts, etc he's never met and likely will not see again, whose attendance he has to pay for.", "Yes, but if 1 family has many more people than the other, it can feel like your family just don't care as much for you, aren't as close, etc. \n\nOf you agreed to have a party with your GF, and she has 100 mates and you only 3, won't you feel a bit...ashamed/failure, etc?", "she doesn\u2019t happen to be mexican by chance, does she? she sounds like every Mexican person I know, i have over 25 first cousins and many more close family friends, whom my parents immigrated with and stayed close to, especially in their first years of being in a foreign country where they are still learning the language. They eventually become real family in everything except blood.", "Woop de doo, not inviting people who likely wouldn't have come, anyway.", "My grandfather on dad's side had 14 kids, 12 of whom lived to adulthood and had 40 children between them, whom at current count have 47 children between them and there are several of my grandathers great grand children that also have children of their own. Then add on spouses and you're close to 200 just from that side alone.\n\nThen my mums side which is much smaller and then close second cousins and other close family members and that would be just one side of the wedding.\n\nAnd I would call it small by limiting my dad's family to around 100", "So, from what you're saying, it is \"throwing money out the window\" unless it's spent the way you think it should be.  \n\nWhere is the compromise in that? Perhaps she'd rather spend money on family than a building. Isn't there a middle ground that will include a nice venue and her family?", "You two sound incompatible. \n\nShe cares more about people than things. You care more about things (a fancier venue) than people. \n\nShe wants to be married surrounded by her family. You think the size of your family should dictate how many of her family she should invite. \n\nYTA, because your \u201cprinciple\u201d is ill-defined and you assumed you\u2019d be able to talk your partner out of the \u201cbig\u201d wedding she said was important to her.", "Which principle would that be? That you agreed to her idea of what the wedding would look like and are now trying to wriggle out of it?\n\nI dont think you are in a position to give anyone a lecture on principles.", "What exactly is the \u201cprinciple\u201d? Her priority is family. Your priority is perhaps a fancy venue. That still leaves: wedding outfits, DJ, food, cake, flowers, photographer, etc (just to name the common wedding expenses) to compromise on so you can both get what\u2019s important to you on your wedding day.", "doesn\u2019t sound like she would? if this is how you\u2019re starting your life together (you completely ignoring her very seriously, very clearly communicated wishes) i bet anything she is reconsidering", "She literally said she would. You should reread OP's post", "he should\u2019ve thought about that when she initially put it as a condition! \n\nit\u2019s not just \u201ca party\u201d too it\u2019s seriously 2 families becoming one. it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s interested", "No, her grandparents were white immigrants", "Shoot I'm pasty white girl and have family like this\n\nI don't like them enough to invite them to my wedding though", "Not necessarily, there are many families that have overseas relatives that would travel for a big event like a wedding or family reunions. We\u2019re not talking about a recurring thing like a birthday. Plus this family seems very tight knit.", "She said she wanted a big wedding, did she say \"or else\"?", "Then the family can pitch in to pay.", "he agreed!", "I know, but you said it was a condition when it sounds more like a preference.", "and that\u2019s something OP should\u2019ve found out rather than assuming she\u2019d get over a very clear boundary", "I agree, he was an AH for just blithely saying yes to a big wedding without thinking it through.\n\nBut is a man not allowed to have nerves about his big day, too? The imbalance of 100+ on her side vs less than 25 at his?"]}
