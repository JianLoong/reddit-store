You are way too stuck on a \u201cyou vs her\u201d thing with numbers when at this point that are ALL family to BOTH of you now. Gain perspective on what marriage means friend.", "Your mindset will make you end up alone. You're in a constant competition with someone you supposedly love. Then, you think you'll just sit in a corner with just your guests and ignore her entire family? You do realize they become your family, right? Or will you just single yourself out your entire marriage? This sounds like a horrible wedding, even if she only invites 5 people. You want her to be miserable.", "The bride and groom go around together to speak to family and friends. Please keep in mind...the people you are trying to exclude will be YOUR family too. You won't have 9 family members, you will have 9 plus how ever many of her family members are there. I have one sibling and it was hard for me to narrow down to 125 for just the people I wanted to invite. He had less to narrow down, but he never faulted me for that.", "I had more people at my wedding because we got married in my country of origin. My husband didn't really speak the language but he came and talked to my family with me. We both still look back on our wedding day with fond memories.", "So, your friends are more important than her family?", "Why would you put acquaintances over inviting her family?", "Because your perspective of, \u201cdon\u2019t invite your family\u201d is stupid as hell", "It's not gendered. You agreed to this and took it back. That's the issue.", "first of all, you agreed to this and is now taking it back. secondly, no we wouldn\u2019t, we\u2019ll still shit on a bride if she does something like this, which is literally excluding her spouse\u2019s family on what is supposed to be the happiest day ever. nobody\u2019s trying to understand your perspective because your perspective is simply ridiculous. she has a massive family and you don\u2019t, so you\u2019re gonna punish her for it?? what are you trying to say here???", "Good lord OP YTA.\n\nAn Irish/Italian Catholic wedding would usually have at least 200 guests! And that would be considered a small wedding. How do I know, that's my family background! \n\nYou are not just marrying your fiance, you are marrying an entire family! Better get used to it!", "This can\u2019t be real. Are you going to spend your reception not by your bride\u2019s side. You will be spending most of the night together and talking to others. If you are actually serious about this you will not be alone", "Sounds like you should\u2019ve made some friends, my dude.", "Have you ever been to any holidays or events with her family? Are you alone there? Honestly this is ridiculous to me. I\u2019m from a larger that 60\nmember Italian Catholic family (grandmother came to the US as a child with her parents). I literally cannot fathom a marriage celebration where the new spouse is made to feel excluded to the point of feeling alone. That\u2019s ridiculous. Weddings are large for us, cousins, aunts/uncles, grandparents, grandparents cousins.  The new family member (which you are) is embraced and celebrated. It doesn\u2019t matter if she sees them weekly, once a year, or once every few years\u2026 they are close and not having them share in your day is the worst way to start your life together. Honestly\u2026 if this is how you view your future family members, please don\u2019t get married. You\u2019re telling her that you don\u2019t want to be part of her family.", "This.", "60+ versus 9 is massive", "OP hired his friend to stick up for him lol", "My fiance is in OP's situation, but ONLY with having less guests. I'll have about 30, and he'll have around 15. He couldn't care less as long as my mom and his brother are there. The only reason we're having a wedding is for my mom. We both lost parents/step-parents, and she's all we have left. He hasn't once complained about it being uneven.", "I bet OP told her she can only have 1 bridesmaid, too.", "Siblings are different than extended family. My fianc\u00e9e has 2 sisters and a brother, I have no siblings, and I have zero problem with all of her siblings being there. I even asked her brother to be one of my groomsmen.", "When did I say I feel inadequate? It has nothing to do with that, I\u2019m perfectly fine with the size of my family. This is about the principle", "Why would I spend my WEDDING DAY talking to a million people I barely know?", "Of course I\u2019ll talk to them, but why would I spend the entire day mingling with people I don\u2019t know well?", "I will talk to her family too, but obviously she\u2019ll be more comfortable around them and have more to say while I\u2019ll be forced to be less social", "This is the way. Why should friends get a chance to bring literal strangers to your wedding if  she has to exclude family?   \n\n\nYTA. Big. HUGE.", "Of course I will, but she\u2019ll have a million other people she wants to mingle with", "Of course I would greet everyone. I would make small talk, talk to her relatives, try to be friendly. But I don\u2019t want to spend my whole wedding night getting to know people when I could just be celebrating with people I already know and am comfortable with", "Then either get over it, or get single. Neither party can control how big their family is, or how close they are to their family. Thi is important to her.", "OP is %100 starting to feel self conscious as he scrambles to pad out his side of the guest list. Sounds like the bride to be is a more likeable person in general.", "not her fault you barely have an extended family\u2026", "Highly likely lmao", "Wow, nice assumption. No, her sisters are her bridesmaids as well as a few of her cousins. I even am having her brother as one of my groomsmen", "Interesting theory given you made an agreement with your fianc\u00e9 and are trying to back out of it. How principled.", "You know one person you could talk to is your wife, and possibly get to know her family who is very important to her. Sometimes being a big kid doing big kid things like getting married means taking big kid risks like talking to your in-laws.", "Because they're a part of your family beginning that day. YTA bruh", "What a strange thing to think. They are your family as of that day too.", "BECAUSE NOW THEYRE YOUR FAMILY. \n\nJfc. My husband and I talked to just about everyone together. As a couple. Y\u2019know. The way we are gonna spend our lives. It\u2019s not a competition.", "I got married in 2021 and this is exactly what you do. There were plenty of people on my wife's side that I didn't know, but I/we mingled with them anyway.\n\n\nIf it wouldn't make you happy to see your wife happy to share your special day with all of the important people in her life, you should re-evaluate your priorities.", "...do you not know how weddings go? That's literally what you spend most of your time doing. \nYTA as less than 100 is a small wedding by most standards.", "YTA, OP sounds like insecure. OP is acting the guest list is a competition. Besides your family, are you inviting any friends?\nI had a medium sized wedding and didn\u2019t get the chance to mingle with everyone. Go enjoy your time with your new bride and your friends/family who came to celebrate you. Just remember, all those people are about to be your family too. The size of her family doesn\u2019t take away from the fact the wedding is a celebration about you and her.", "That's kind of Wedding Protocol 101, dude.", "Do you not have friends that you can invite too? I get that you\u2019re trying to keep costs down but one compromise could be to bring more of your people in rather than kicking her people out.\n\nRegardless, I agree with the general sentiment that the wife\u2019s family comes with the wife. You don\u2019t need to make a deep connection with everybody all at once, but embrace the opportunity to meet more of her family members. You\u2019ll still be able to spend plenty of time doing other wedding activities too I assume.", "Are you just anti social? Thats what weddings are dude, like sorry but going into the marriage by breaking an agreement and then keeping score to keep it \u201cfair\u201d doesn\u2019t bode well. I said it somewhere else but i have 100ish family members not including kids and not going past first cousins and my wife has about 20. If she told me i needed to cut down on FAMILY there wouldn\u2019t have been a wedding ESPECIALLY if she said \u201cits not fair\u201d. \n\nNot even trying to be mean but you sound like you need to grow up if thats your real reason.", "Lol Irish family here and it\u2019s huge\u2026 and yes the family still in Ireland comes from overseas to weddings", "I honestly think it's more of a religious culture thing rather than ethnic or racial culture. Even if your immediate family is not religious, some of those habits die hard.\n\nI was raised Catholic. Although I don't practice now, needing to invite everyone has stuck. I have a HUGE family. Particularly on my dad's side. He's one of 12 children. My mother was one of 3, but even her family is decently sized. \n\nMy husband' family is bigger than mine (dad one of 15 and mom one of 13) but the need to invite people to things just isn't there. \n\nEven funerals on his side are significantly smaller. Where on my side, you'd better have a huge funeral home and hall. Even the out of state people come. My dad's siblings are mostly gone now, but their kids and their kids kids absolutely still come. It's quite nice to see everyone show up, not going to lie.", "That\u2019s still valid of her \u201cnot getting her way\u201d. He promised this to her. And he knew how big her family was.", "Also, even if you take into account they\u2019re family, OP said what if they invited people she didn\u2019t know\u2026 the point isn\u2019t that OP doesn\u2019t know the people, it\u2019s that fianc\u00e9e knows them and wants them there.", "Ah, to fill your side? Because this is literally what you've said...that the Eason you don't want her to have people who love her there is because you'll feel lonely with your 13 guests. Even though you also said you both have several friends that you're allowing to bring a guest also. Seems like you have an issue with both your fiance and her family.", "So weird, it\u2019s almost like a wedding is supposed to be the joining of 2 families\u2026 you\u2019re kinda supposed to talk to them", "I\u2019ve never been to a wedding before", "Why is everyone assuming we\u2019re only inviting our relatives? She has plenty of friends she wants to invite, as do I, plus mutual friends, etc. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking her to limit the amount of family she wants to come", "Unless you stop being an asshole, I don't think that'll change anytime soon.", "We can tell", "Or they can use the money they literally saved for the purpose of a large wedding lol", "On top of the thousands of dollars they\u2019ll pay to get and stay there and the gift they\u2019re likely to send?", "I didn't say that. I literally said you were inviting friends. You're placing more importance on friends and their dates than her actual family."]}
