We did that until we had all of the family covered that we felt was necessary. Whatever was left in the total number decided in the beginning was then negotiable and as evenly divided as possible. So, I had more family, and he had more friends, so we decided to split the remaining spots about 70/30. That was what was more fair for him, and I offered that split. He suggested 60/40, but I wouldn't have needed that many. \n\nSay, 200 people (that's a decent size but not outrageous. 100-200 is typical for a formal wedding)\n\nI had 20 plus the second cousins would be 12 more. Some of those would require a plus 1, so let's say 50 total family from my side. He had 5 and then another 5, with plus ones at 15. We are now at 65. Our parents had people to invite plus our friends. With couples or a single+1 that left 135 spots for 62 invitations divided in half would be 31 invitations each.

THATS COMPROMISE. Tell her that you want to spend your wedding with HER doing things you both enjoy.

You can spend your time grilling up some cheap hotdogs if you are super concerned about small talk. While i totally see your point of view, how would you feel if the roles were reversed. What if you had to cut down your FAMILY by over 50%? Would you want your mother or father to miss out on your milestone event. I think you know that YTA here for trying to go back on your word. Hopefully you know the right thing here is to let her invite her whole family considering you can afford it. \nThis is a simple fix, a simple conversation of \u201choney I\u2019m concerned that your family outnumbers mine, so greatly, that we would get caught up in mingling the whole time and that\u2019s not how i expected our special day would go, what if we ALL got together the day before the wedding and you can catch up then, that way our special day will be about us and not me meeting every single family member\u201d.", "YTA but I think you're overthinking this. You will be with your wife while you greet the guests (either a receiving line or by going around to each table). You will only have time to say hi and thanks for coming or very brief small talk where they congratulate you both. She will take the lead at tables of her guests and you will take the lead at tables of your guests. Then you will sit next to your wife during dinner/toasts etc (timing/order of things is different at different weddings). Then if your wedding is any fun you'll spend most of the rest of the night on the dance floor or chatting with whoever you want- and she will do the same.

A couple who is about to get married souls have INCREDIBLY better communication then you do.", "OP I suspect a lot of the misaligned expectations boil down to that (the you not having been to a wedding before).\n\n\nI think it\u2019s important to take a step back and frame what you define as the wedding ceremony and what you define as the reception. What purposes do each serve? What do they mean not just to you and your fianc\u00e9e, but also other important people in your lives?\n\n\nAs an Irish Italian Catholic from a large family, similar to your fianc\u00e9e I would like to offer some perspective. \n\nThe ceremony itself is the uniting of you two in the marriage. If y\u2019all are religious, the ceremony honors and reflects that. Some people + cultures find such ceremony to be an extremely intimate component and only have immediate family and the religious officiant present. Some welcome everyone under the sun. Some only wish to have the ceremony witnessed by those within their religion. There is no wrong answer. That is up to you and your soon to be wife to reflect on what the goals of your ceremony are. \n\n\nThe reception does not necessarily share the same priorities and consideration as the ceremony. (They might! But it doesn\u2019t *have* to be.)\n\nReceptions take all different forms. And it would be a bit disingenuous to say its *just* about you two, as if you two existed in a vacuum. You don\u2019t exist in a vacuum and have an entire history of your lives that you are now blending with your union. Like Christmas and Easter celebrations arent *entirely* limited to religious observance, neither is a wedding reception. There is unspoken meaning behind attendance. Perhaps this will be the first get together of the entire family since Great Grandpa died? Or this will be the first time Aunt Sophie has been able to make an event for XYZ reason. Maybe Dad has been going through chemo and this is a chance for the family to all be together for a reason that *isnt* a funeral. You won\u2019t likely know until after the fact, but each family gathering has its own significance as well as family significance. Especially if your family is at all spread out and not all living in the same small area.\n\nNo matter what: the celebration is about you. But that \u201cyou\u201d is the new family unit created by you and your new spouse. That inherently includes the families you have that are now joined. \n\nEspecially in big families where there were blood cousins and \u201ccousins\u201d it would be unimaginable to draw an arbitrary line of importance of those who you define as \u201cfamily.\u201d  Certainly it\u2019s not true of every family, and maybe there\u2019s an entire branch somewhere that is totally able to be cut. But that\u2019s for you and your fianc\u00e9e to decide together, not determine through the idea of throwing out a random number limit. \n\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to one, I suppose it\u2019s worth breaking down how generally the timeline goes: \n\nCeremony \u2014> photos with you and your new spouse and likely the bridesmaids/groomsmen and parents or whoever \u2014> while y\u2019all are doing photos everyone not in photos goes to a cocktail hour type thing and stays there until the reception begins. \nWhen you finish w photos, you generally take a small break to regroup, touch up makeup and eat. This is your only downtime all day. \nWhen you get to the reception space, everyone moves from the cocktail hour to the actual reception. This happens when y\u2019all are introduced as a married couple and the reception begins. At that point you both generally go from table to table  together and say hello. Obviously food + speeches + dancing are intertwined, but the point is you will either be going around to greet everyone or people will be stopping by to greet and congratulate you. It\u2019s not free in any sense to attend a wedding. Taking time from people\u2019s already hectic lives to dress up, get sitters etc is a gesture unto itself. It would be in *extremely* poor taste to not take the time to greet your guests that are there *for you*. That you haven\u2019t met all of her family is irrelevant. They are *your* family now too. And it might suck having to meet 100 new strangers. But it\u2019s quick. It\u2019s general. And then you move right along. You are a unit, greeting your new blended family as your new unit for the first time.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s important. Because the memories you look back with aren\u2019t the \u201cthe napkins were hideous\u201d or \u201cthe chicken was bland.\u201d You and your guests will remember how the wedding made them *feel*.\n\n\nYour new spouse, surrounded by their friends and family (old and new!) and seeing them all jovial and celebratory will be the happy takeaway that you want. \n\nWhether it\u2019s a blood cousin or a \u201ccousin\u201d\u2014 including someone in a reception is a way many give thanks and appreciation for love + support given to them in their lives. A sort of honor and recognition of appreciation for others for how they impacted their lives. Especially for the intangibles\u2014 the neighbor who was *always* there with an open door and an extra place setting at the table; or the great aunt who fostered your love for painting; or dads best friend who donated his kidney and you can\u2019t thank him enough for giving your dad the gift of additional life. \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s less articulable.\nLike the aunt who *always* made you feel included. Or the cousin who stood up for you always. \n\nThe \u201cit takes a village\u201d is true for many people. And I suspect your fianc\u00e9e, like those of us raised with the village, view wedding celebrations as an official way to honor gratitude for the sacrifices and efforts of that village. It would otherwise be impossible to go back and articulate sufficient recognition for all the hard work of raising families- and for many, this is how one truly shows acknowledgment for the love and support given to them throughout life.\n\nBut like I said, there are many reasons and considerations that go into it. You two need to discuss the whys of your goals. There\u2019s a reason your fianc\u00e9e has their goals and it would be a mistake to summarily dismiss those reasons without hearing them. It\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t have legitimate concerns. However, like any compromise, they can be received when you have a better idea of their position as well. \n\n\nCongratulations and best of luck on your upcoming big day. \n\nRemember lots of water and taking moments to yourself to breathe and take it all in.", "Then I\u2019m here to inform you- you\u2019re wrong.

I'm sorry, did they all live together in the same household? Next to each other? How frequently did they see each other? It's a wedding, I get that.

Both should make a list of who they KNOW they want to have there, as if they were going to have a small wedding with only these people if they were unable to afford a massive wedding, THEN build on it from there.

It's also a great way to get through the leftover food (of which there's often a fair amount). It's also nice for people who have travelled in, as you get to actually have a chance to catch-up without the busy wedding-day-schedule and formalities.
