OP is not excluding the sister\u2019s established and committed partner from a private family event, rather a casual person they are seeing.\n\nYour family may be different, but inviting a random man to wherever OP is having this party could be potentially dangerous. The sister may \u201cknow\u201d this guy in their brief time of getting to know one another but the family obviously does not and established that boundary.", "OP states further in a comment that the two are not in a committed relationship, have only been speaking for about a month, and the day of the party is 1 day out of 8 that she will be in town.", "I feel like getting hung up on the \u201cfuture husband\u201d thing is a bit wild. From what I understand, OP and her sister are very close, I doubt someone she really was considering as a future husband would be not welcome at the event.

But her husband would also be an established member of the family at that point, not someone who has never actually met the person he is supposed to be marrying or their family. Yeah, introductions are hard when long distance, but introducing them at an intimate family gathering to celebrate 4 birthdays and Christmas is probably not the best time.", "i think you got a little mixed up there", "I get what you meant. She knew it was going to be a small family gathering because she helped plan it. She wanted to do something as a family to get to spend quality time with all of us. I\u2019m also 8 months pregnant and my sister and I are VERY close so because she lives so far away it\u2019s been very hard for me to be away from her for such a long time.

This family event isn\u2019t the time to meet him in person for the first time. OP is NTA here\u2026sister knows, and wanted, a very small family get together.", "I think you may be assuming a lot. The OP states in a comment that it is their first time meeting, sister lives in Georgia and the guy is in California. Also, the OP didn\u2019t say she couldn\u2019t go see this guy another day, just not at an intimate family gathering, which they absolutely do have \u201ccontrol\u201d over who is and isn\u2019t invited.", "Read the post carefully, the sister has never met the guy.", "Did you miss the part that said she's never actually met the guy? So yes, it IS her first date with him.", "OP states these two people have never met before in a comment. First date and partner are two very different relationships. Commuted established partner to an event, or even a significant other, sure.

Sister is also talking to other people at this time.", "OP stated it\u2019s an intimate family gathering, multiple birthdays as well as Christmas.

I get the vibe she\u2019s using this as her chance to meet this guy in person and is trying to kill birds. \n\nI\u2019d be clear with her that no one is comfortable with this stranger coming to the party, but if she wants support meeting him in person (cuz I mean she could just want to feel safe meeting this guy), yall can plan something at another time where they can meet and you or other family members can be there in case he\u2019s like a creep or something. There\u2019s always ways to move around the daytime schedules and there\u2019s lots of activities this time of year.", "Love bombing energy", "NTA - not NYA - sorry!", "Well, feelings can go fast, certainty can too. And often it ends up badly - but that is not the rule\n\nIf the sister feels like her Christmas is ruined because of it, she must feel strongly enough for her to be hurt by it.", "Hard to know the dedication between them or whether its a joke or something serious. But Christmas and birthdays dont really need to be THAT intimate. Its just a time to be with loved ones - family and friends, and enjoy the time together.\n\nAnd when someone feels bad about having to leave someone they love/like behind, its not really a joyful time for them.", "You really need to be careful. Your sister wants to invite a complete stranger to you all who will now know you address what's in your home (to be stolen) ect ect. How dare she do that to you especially as your pregnant too. She could have met him the next day in a public setting with you there if she's that desperate to meet him. Also she's really showing her son just who her priority is. Disgusting behaviour. NTA", "SO the sister will simply not come to the event because her AH family are gatekeeping her relationships. She is fine to priorize the new partner.", "At dsome point you will learn that you can not expect to gatekeep other people's relationships if you want them to come to your events.", "Okay. Thanks for the update. NTA - the guy could be crazy for all she knows.", "This is also a place where we weigh in with our experiences and perspectives. Considering that it was totally normal for my Mom to have a random coworker or two grab a plate at Christmas, it does seem extremely weird and even a little bit unreasonable that someone can't bring their boyfriend by. As I said, and I acknowledged, maybe your family gatherings are different than mine, but I don't think we've ever told someone they couldn't bring a date to a birthday or a holiday gathering. Clearly, the sister in this situation seems to think it's perfectly reasonable.", "I\u2019m not saying things wouldn\u2019t work out with this guy. That\u2019s not my place to say. But to introduce someone at a family gathering not just for the holidays, but also several family member birthdays (including her son) that you only know as briefly as OP has stated, is a big ask. And it seems like from the post, sister did not ask to invite this guy, she just invited him. Family party introduction for a first date is not the move.", "As someone who met their husband online and agreed to marry them before actually having met them in person \\[though we had contingency plans if we decided we didn't get along\\], I still think bringing this guy to a family Christmas event is in poor taste. It's one thing for her to want to meet this guy for the first time and be with him and potentially marry him, but until all their ducks are actually in a row or they are more committed, they should leave the first family meet n greet to something that isn't a Christmas holiday.", "They don\u2019t have to be intimate, but OP states specifically that it\u2019s an intimate and small family party. PJ party to be exact. So this one obviously is going to be.", "I think you\u2019re missing the point. Gatekeeping isn\u2019t the correct term here. OP\u2019s post says the two are not in a relationship, and the two have never met in person before. OP has every right to decide if they want a random person to be invited to an intimate family gathering they planned, regardless of who invited them. I feel like this would be a different story if the person the sister planned on bringing someone who wasn\u2019t completely random, or an established partner the family is familiar with or had some kind of interaction with before springing them on everyone at a family party to celebrate other people\u2019s birthdays.", "This person could be any kind of catfishing scammer, he could be casing OP's house, he could be three kids in a trenchcoat for that matter. No one has met him. Online first dates need to be in public places for safety. This has nothing to do with gatekeeping.", "Thats probably not the best way to do it yes. But it could be blamed on the distance here.\n\nOn the other hand, how many guys would want to meet the \"whole gang\" when not serious about the girl? So at least she found a good one ;)", "Hah. Welcome to weird girls club ;) same here!\n\nIm probably a bit biased because l understand how it is to introduce anyone whilst living far away. I have my family spread around in 5 different countries (probably equivalentto far away states in the US). So to me, family gatherings are the only time l can imagine seeing my family. Which means any introductions of partners would have to happen then.", "Or he could just be sister's new partner.", "Or she's found a scammer which is more likely.", "I think the point OP is trying to make is that they are too early in their relationship to tell if this even is a good guy. Talking to him for a months while also seeing/talking to other people doesn\u2019t seem to me like she\u2019s too serious about the guy. At least to ACTUALLY ruin her christmas.\n\nAgain, if this was someone who was established in her life and he wanted to go, I think this would be a different story. But he\u2019s a guy she doesn\u2019t really know and her family doesn\u2019t know at all. So they have every right to not let a strange man into their home during a specified intimate family gathering. Crazy people exist, and just because sis thinks it\u2019s her soulmate 1 month into knowing the guy doesn\u2019t mean the family has to invite a stranger into their home."]}
