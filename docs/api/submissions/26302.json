Ever since my MIL (F83) got weaker and older, she lives with us, too. Two years ago MIL was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. She is under medical care, of course, but despite it the disease is progressing fastly. Nowadays MIL cannot stay at home alone as she is dangerous for herself and her surroundings. She almost burned the house, twice, and there were also some other accidents. Fortunately as for now she didn't hurt herself seriously but at this rate the question is \"when\" it will happen, not \"if\".\n\nTaking care of her is mostly my responsibillity, as my husband has very irregular schedule and - because of nature of his work - he often has to be on call and/or leave home at short notice.\n\nAs for me, I usually work 8-10 h/day, mostly from home but sometimes I have to be in the office. After I finish work, I take care of the house and MIL. My husband helps me as much as possible but quite often he can't be there for me.\n\nI'll be honest, I never was a caretaker type. I don't have enough patience, I don't like when other people depend on me, I am nervous when I suddenly have to adjust my plans. I cared about my children, obviously, and I like to believe that I was a decent mother, but honestly I have much better contact with them and (as bad as it sounds) love them more since they grew up and got more independent.\n\nThe more my MIL needs my help, the more I grow impatient, exhausted and burned out. I do my best to not to show it but the situation realy wears me off. And I am well aware that with time she'll need even more attention and patience. Admittedly, given that I cannot always work from home, and MIL can't be alone, I have constant problems at work, which upsets me, as I cherish my work and career.\n\nGiven everything, I want to put my MIL into nursing home. Obviously, before I do so, I'll research and choose one with good reputation and qualified staff. My husband has mixed feelings about it, which is understandable as she is his mother, but he says that given that I'm the one mostly taking care of her, the final decision is mine to make.\n\nProblem is, husband's siblings are raising hell, calling me (and husband, but mostly me) cruel and undependable. They say I should just hire a nurse or something. I don't want to let a stranger into my house AND I don't want to be a caretaker at all and in this configuration I'd still have to take care of MIL after work. We (I and my husband) offered them that we'll pay *them* for either taking her to live with one of them, or for taking care of her at our place but they weren't interested citing, that \"it's too much responsibility\" and \"they have their own lives\". But... that's exactly why I considered the nursing home at the first place?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693996977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bgvks/wibta_if_ill_put_my_mil_in_nursing_home/", "score": 351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quite often, people are responding to the phrase \"put in a nursing home\" because it sounds like you are kenneling a dog.

It's not just about being your burden (honestly, shouldn't fall on you, where are your husband's deadbeat siblings???). It's about what's best for your MIL, you and your family, and anyone who opposes putting her in a reputable care facility can go scrub their buttholes with a rock.", "NTA, your ailing MIL needs more care than you can actually provide.

No? then they are NOT entitled to chip in on this decisions. \nYour husband was fair right saying he wouldn't like it, but as you are the main caretaker it is up to you.\n\nOne of the most pitful scene i had to witness was my mother lose her mind because her mother forgot to put down pants before going to the toilet, for the hundredth time.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA but it is ridiculous that *you* must do all the caretaking, make this decision, and deal with the fallout.  You have a husband problem. His job is okey donkey yours is suffering because \u2026 reasons.   He should be changing his job and or arranging for care.

They can put up or shut up.", "Your first responsibility is to ensure the safety and well-being of your MIL. With the progression of Alzheimer's, it's clear she needs round-the-clock care. A reputable nursing home with qualified staff can provide a safe environment for her. This would prevent accidents that might endanger her and your household.", "NTA. I'm glad your husband is taking your suggestion seriously, and realises that as her primary caretaker, yours is the key vote on this. If her siblings seriously think that their lives are more important than yours, feck'em, as we say in Ireland. You have done your bit, and it is now time for you to focus on your own wellbeing.", "NTA. Start researching now because there is usually a waiting list for the good nursing homes that take Alzheimer's patients. \n\nYour inlaws are not entitled to your time or piece of mind. Nor should you have to risk your job or home. I'm also guessing that they have never given you and your husband a break.", "NTA.

So the siblings call it cruel if you put her in a nursing home where she gets the best care she deserves, but they don't want to take care themselves? Hypocrites...", "NTA. \n\nIt's always the one who's not carrying the burden makes the loudest noises. \n\n\u201cif you\u2019re going to talk the talk, you\u2019ve got to walk the walk\u201d", "NTA tell the siblings to take care of her then, if I\u2019m assuming correctly she\u2019s been under your care for around 2 years now?

You are very justified in wanting her to have round the clock care", "NTA. Sometimes it comes to a point that you need an expert to take care of your loved ones.  \nYou can't do it alone anymore.  \n\n\nIt's selfish of your family to expect you to care of her when you can't anymore. They cite your reasons and think they are plausible then.\n\nGive them the ultimatum: They can either have MIL live with them or she goes to a nursing home.", "Omg the entitlement here. Tell your BILs that if they are against it they are all welcome to take her in. Sure enough they'll find excuses that they can't, don't have enough space and time, while trying to convince you that you have or demanding that you leave your job for her since you can afford it (even if you can't they may try to)\n\nTaking care of an old Alzeihmer Patient is fricking hard, and is a full time job. Even if you could work 100% from home you wouldn't be an asshole. She needs special care, so the right thing is to give her special care, and that is NOT your job. Nursing home is the answer.\n\nIf you wanna keep the peace with your entitled in laws, let them have a say on the nursing home choice; but put a time limit to that, like \"I'm set on this one, if you think it's not good enough you're free to ask for another one or take her in yourself, but you have two weeks to decide after that I put her in mine.\". Without a time limit they may constantly tell you that the home you choose is not good enough, while asking for more time to decide.\n\nNTA obviously. Don't worry, it's always the ones who don't take care of the old that are raising hell when the nursing option is put on the table.\n\nEdit: didn't saw the end of your post, where you in laws reacted exactly as I said...again, it's incredibly entitled of them to ask you to make sacrifices they wouldn't make themselves.", "YWNBTA\n\nAlzheimer's disease is progressive and it sounds like she already needs a lot of supervision.\n\nShe would be safer in a place set up to care for these types of patients. In all likelihood she will require  24 hours supervision soon ( this was my job for a while). That is exhausting all by itself with nothing else to do, just as a shift. \nDo not do it 24/7 you will break.\n\nIf your husband is not onsite to provide care, then moving her to a place that caters for her medical needs is the oniy sensible solution. And her family should pay for it. She is their mother after all.\n\nIt's always easy to be generous with other people's time and effort as evidenced by his family. If they are not willing to look after her themselves, then they shoujd sit down and STFU because it's not their health and energy which is being damaged here.", "NTA you're doing a wonderful job with a very hard situation and everyone in this situation needs to be more aware of the intense mental load it's putting on you. Your in-laws are being awful, please don't let them get to you. It's normal to feel guilty at this stage feeling like you're not enough, but your MIL needs the extra care. Don't let your in-laws make you doubt that you're doing the right thing.\n\n\nBTW it's pretty telling that it sounds like you're the person prepared to take on the mental load of choosing a good care facility too, as opposed to any of her actual blood relatives. She's lucky to have you.", "NTA.  Do this before she does burn the house down.  And if the siblings don't want to take her in, a memory care home is the only option.", "NTA. You and your husband should have a frank discussion about your limitations. To me, MIL's safety and well-being should be main priorities. Neither of you are trained professionals. Your health is at risk in providing care for hey. What would hubby do if you strained your back? I would HIGHLY recommend researching nursing homes and memory care facilities now. Before it's an emergency and there is no time for research. Also, it is better for her to move while she may still have a chance of adjusting to her new place. Be prepared for a big change after a move. It may not be pretty. We had moved my stepmother to a memory care facility during her decline. We really drug our feet about the final move to a nursing home. We were so wrong in our opinions of nursing home care. They were incredible. Many years ago, I had worked in one and I promised myself that I would die before going to one. If the one we experienced is any indication, they are completely different today than back then. I know there are bad ones though. When you do your research, I would encourage you to visit the facilities at different times of the day and week so you can see how it operates when top management are not there. Remind your husband that mom's (and yours) well-being outweigh his guilt.", "NTA.  Your feelings are 100% NORMAL, and this (sadly) is a typical situation.  \n\nTake your MiL to her doctor, tell them what's going on at home, and let the professional tell you it's time.", "NTA. My friends family had a similar issue. Her pop had dementia and her nana was looking after him. Nana couldn't handle it, but my friends' uncles were abusing her and threatening her so she wouldn't do it. But the uncles wouldn't look after him. Eventually, he had a nasty fall, and the dr ordered that he had to go to a nursing home. My friends pop and Nana are both doing much better now. He gets the care he needs and her Nana isn't depressed and burnt out anymore. \n\nI always thought it was so rude of her uncles to demand her Nana look after her pop, that it was cruel to put him in a home. But they wouldn't care for him.", "NTA. My mum (56) was in the exact same position with her mother (96) except she lived just up the road and my mum was essentially her carer and did everything for her. This was a really hard time for my mum and grandma because my grandma just wanted to die and my mum kinda wanted the same because it was so much work and stress. \n\nHer brother is essentially useless and never offered to help and barely visited.\n\nThis made my mum feel incredibly unhappy in the few years she had to do this. Eventually, we got my grandma into a carehome and she died which is a blessing in some ways for her and my mum. \n\nThe caring responsibilities become so much worse when someone has Alzheimer\u2019s and they very quickly deteriorate. It becomes really hard to cater and care for sometimes. I really do agree with your decision to put her in a nursing home. You have your own responsibilities and work to do, you can\u2019t put up with this for the rest of your lives. \n\nI\u2019d say to the siblings that if they refuse to take their mother in, then you\u2019re putting her in a nursing home. It\u2019s your decision and that\u2019s final.", "NTA, so firstly, sounds like you\u2019ve been doing great in a job that you aren\u2019t really that keen on, well done for doing it for so long, caring for an older person with Alzheimer\u2019s is HARD. Secondly the solution is simple, the siblings can care for her, I\u2019d call a family meeting, say your burnt out and exhausted, the options are care home or one of the siblings can pick up the care. Def NTA. Often as degenerative conditions progress, appropriately caring for the person comes to need professional skills and dedication of time. You are caring by saying it\u2019s above your pay grade.", "NTA: If they care that much it's their turn to take care of mama.  Also, honestly, if your MIL is progressing to the dangerous to herself and others she may be better cared for in a facility with a memory care unit.  they're (usually) trained for this (there are bad ones of course do your research).", "NTA in the least! \nYour husband needs to take the lead in dealing with his sibs because, to them, you're the terrible outlaw DIL/SIL. They'd rather raise hell and demonize you instead of taking a hard look in the mirror.\n\nIn his later years, my grandfather lived 4 months at a time with each of his 5 sons and their families. If your husband's sibs don't think their mother is safer in an assisted living facility, don't you think they need to step up and do thei fair share? \n\nJust curious: what is your husband's birth order in his family?", "NTA.

If she hurts herself in your home I'm sure the peanut gallery will have thoughts on that too. They're not helping so they don't get a say.", "NTA\n\nA memory care unit could do wonders for your MIL. Alziheimers patients do not adjust well to change, and the transition may be easier if she has more lucid times than not. \n\nThis is not cruel, it could be life saving.", "Interesting...if my mother had been living with one of my siblings and their spouse for 5 years, with the SIL/BIL doing most of the practical help, I'd be 1) falling all over myself thanking them and 2) taking over her care or supporting the nursing home solution.", "NTA.\n\nYou're definitely doing the right thing. Sure it'd be nice for her to stay with family. But if her condition gets worse, it will cause better problems. You're a lovely person for thinking of her and taking care of her until now. Def choose a nice home for her. Her family can visit her whenever they miss her.\n\nAnd your in-laws gosh I hate ppl like them who get mad about changes but won't help. They can go put their fingers in their buttholes.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility. Your in laws should be the ones to take care of her if putting her in a nursing home is such a big issue for them.", "NTA, nice if husbands siblings to volunteer to let MIL live with them this makes the point moot so you don\u2019t have an issue any more.\n\nLet them know that it\u2019s kind of them to let her live with them and if they backtrack tell that it\u2019s so sad that they won\u2019t look after her and would rather see her in a nursing home.", "NTA \n\nI love how all the family want you to do something they are unwilling to do.  They are hypocrites and assholes.  \n\nCaretaking for someone with Alzheimer\u2019s is exhausting!\n\nRemember how on the airplane they tell you to put on your oxygen mask before helping others?  That is the case here.  You need to take care of yourself FIRST.  Then you be able to take care of her SECOND.  that probably means putting her in a nursing home.   \n\nIf she stays at home you will be angry and resentful.  Your marriage will suffer.  You don\u2019t deserve that.  \n\nIf she goes to a nursing home you will then have energy to be able to help with all the necessary stuff \u2014 visiting, Medicare, finances, interacting with her caretakers.  \n\nDon\u2019t be a martyr.  Take care of yourself and get your MiL the professional care she deserves.  \n\nAnd get you husband to support you 100% with this decision.", "My sister and I had to make this decision for my father, about a year after my mother passed away.  He had been living alone, but we noticed he was not eating properly, and got lost several times while driving around.  The final straw was when we discovered he had not been taking his medication properly.\n\nThere was absolutely no way my sister could have taken care of my father, as she lives several hundred miles away.  In theory, I could have moved in with him, but I'm not a good caregiver, and while we had a loving relationship my whole life, living together would have been very negative.\n\nTwo years ago, we moved my dad into an assisted living facility.  Fortunately, my parents' estate and dad's benefits are enough to cover the cost.  He is definitely getting the attention and care that he needs.  I could not care for him like the nurses and staffers do.  My sister and I do not regret this decision one bit.\n\n**Your in-laws can step up, or shut the hell up**.

I was six, and my oldest sister was in her 20s. My mom was like, \"Okay, where is the money?

After that date, you will do what you have to do, and they are going to just have to deal with it.\n\nPeople who aren't caregivers have no effing idea of how difficult it is - but they are always sooooo willing to tell someone else what and how to do things.  You need to make them uncomfortable.  This is their mother, not yours.  You shouldn't be shouldering the majority of the work.  Her kids should be doing it but are not.  I'd be looking them in the eye and asking them, \"So what time shall I drop mom off at your place?\"  If they won't help, tell them to shut their traps - they don't get a say.", "Oh Sweetie you will not be the AH for putting your MIL in a nursing home. If anything, she will receive around-the-clock care and she'll also have the company of other older people.\n\nAlso, tell your husband's siblings to pound sand.

One of her husband's siblings sent $100 per month which didn't even cover the cost of adult diapers for a week. Another who lived closer would sashay in for a visit once a month with perfectly manicured hands, designer clothes and sometimes, a bag of donuts, the third lived abroad but at least had the decency to send more money and would actually relieve my SIL when she came to visit. Like your in-laws, the thought of putting MIL in a nursing home was not to be considered because the poor old dear would miss her family. What family? They barely visited anyway and my SIL had the backbreaking tasks of bathing, changing diapers several times a day and changing the sheets just as often. \n\nMy husband's old aunt was in a similar position but all of her kids decided a nursing home was the best place for her. She loved it!! The staff would pop in for a chat several times a day, she had company with other oldies and her children/grandchildren took turns visiting every single day so that she had a visitor every single day. What's more, because they all shared the visiting duties it was not overwhelming for anyone and they actually enjoyed the time they spent with her. \n\nSure thing, hire the nurse but ask the siblings which one of them will take in THEIR mother. Throwing money at this is the easy way out but honestly, a good nursing home is the best solution for you and your MIL.", "My dad spent his last 3 years in a nursing home after a catastrophic stroke, but I also saw how beautifully well cared for the physically fit but mentally fragile residents were treated.

Ever since my MIL (F83) got weaker and older, she lives with us, too. Two years ago MIL was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. She is under medical care, of course, but despite it the disease is progressing fastly. Nowadays MIL cannot stay at home alone as she is dangerous for herself and her surroundings. She almost burned the house, twice, and there were also some other accidents. Fortunately as for now she didn't hurt herself seriously but at this rate the question is \"when\" it will happen, not \"if\".\n\nTaking care of her is mostly my responsibillity, as my husband has very irregular schedule and - because of nature of his work - he often has to be on call and/or leave home at short notice. \n\nAs for me, I usually work 8-10 h/day, mostly from home but sometimes I have to be in the office. After I finish work, I take care of the house and MIL. My husband helps me as much as possible but quite often he can't be there for me. \n\nI'll be honest, I never was a caretaker type. I don't have enough patience, I don't like when other people depend on me, I am nervous when I suddenly have to adjust my plans. I cared about my children, obviously, and I like to believe that I was a decent mother, but honestly I have much better contact with them and (as bad as it sounds) love them more since they grew up and got more independent. \n\nThe more my MIL needs my help, the more I grow impatient, exhausted and burned out. I do my best to not to show it but the situation realy wears me off. And I am well aware that with time she'll need even more attention and patience. Admittedly, given that I cannot always work from home, and MIL can't be alone, I have constant problems at work, which upsets my, as I cherish my work and career. \n\nGiven everything, I want to put my MIL into nursing home. Obviously, before I do so, I'll research and choose one with good reputation and qualified staff. My husband has mixed feelings about it, which is understandable as she is his mother, but he says that given that I'm the one mostly taking care of her, the final decision is mine to make. \n\nProblem is, husband's siblings are raising hell, calling me (and husband, but mostly me) cruel and undependable. They say I should just hire a nurse or something. I don't want to let a stranger into my house AND I don't want to be a caretaker at all and in this configuration I'd still have to take care of MIL after work. We (I and my husband) offered them that we'll pay *them* for either taking her to live with one of them, or for taking care of her at our place but they weren't interested citing, that \"it's too much responsibility\" and \"they have their own lives\". But... that's exactly why I considered the nursing home at the first place?\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. This is slightly different than OPs story, but still speaks to the family dynamics and battles of care.\n\nMy mom and her sister were 5 years apart. My mom was also the \u201cbad daughter\u201d who took a college scholarship in the big city (about 90 min away) and didn\u2019t move back to the hometown. \n\nAnything related to grandma\u2019s health, my aunt would gatekeep. She was a nurse and would dictate where grandma could stay during any sort of health issues and wouldn\u2019t let my mom have any sort of input, despite her willingness to help both with logistics and money. And then my aunt would gripe and complain and just treat my mom like absolute shit because she \u201cwasn\u2019t there\u201d. It was a terrible cycle.\n\nMy aunt passed from colon cancer in 2004, and Grandma lived much longer. My mom managed everything, including a move to a senior apartment and then assisted living. It sounds awful to say, but honestly, it was so much easier, in some aspects, that everything was up to my mother and there was no debate or battling. Family caregiving is fraught with so many internal politics and judgement that often have nothing to do with the person needing care.", "NTA. You obviously don\u2019t need to explain or rebut any of the siblings arguments or accusations.  They obviously know what a drain and an unfortunate burden it can be. They\u2019re just very content to have it be someone else\u2019s problem. You offered a reasonable solution she stay with them and you pay for in-home care for part of the time, and they passed.

Sometimes it's just better for the person to be put into a nursing home where they can have better supervision and better help.", "There will be a time when you won't be able to work from home as your MIL will not be able to be alone for ANY amount of time. Nursing homes (look for one that specializes in memory care) are not the hell holes we imagine. Most people adjust well and make friends and have a much better quality of life. The best way to insure your MIL gets good care is to visit and check up on her. Believe me, when staff knows family is likely to be coming over they are more diligent. Assign all the siblings a day of the week to go see their Mom. Doesn't have to be a super long visit. \n\nSource: my 20 yrs experience as a caregiver, both in private homes and care facilities.\n\nP.S. where I am a live in caregiver costs about $2100 per week.", "NTA.

Everyone there will have your back. This is so hard. You are doing the right thing for her and yourself.", "NTA. I think that for a lot of people the idea of 'putting someone in care' is very emotive. They think of it as somehow abandoning responsibility or worry about what other people will think of them. The truth is that you need to prioritise the needs of the person who needs care, and care homes are set up to provide that. At the turn of the year I had to make the decision to move my mum (90) into a care home. She's been having cognitive issues for years and though she had always been determined to stay in her own home, it had got to a point where she was a danger to herself. For a while we tried to mitigate things by having carers come in, but, unless you're paying for full time at-home care, it's not enough. Neither myself or my brother were set up to take Mum in and care for her, so we made the decision to move her to a care home very close to our house - it was personally recommended by a friend who's mum had also been there. Though it was a tough decision, the home itself did wonders for her in terms of giving her an environment where she could have her needs met by people who knew exactly what they were doing and weren't frayed to the edges by having to fit in the care around other jobs. I think you need to speak to your relatives and make clear that it's your MIL's needs that are the priority here, and it sounds like a care home would meet them best. Good luck.", "NTA. Seems like you have taken on the responsibility that her children are unwilling to do, yet they want to judge you for trying to suggest the best outcome for all involved.", "NTA. I have been in exactly your position with my grandmother. I was caring for her part time with my mother and my brothers and working full time and none of us could cope. I still feel immense guilt though I know it was best for her as well as us. Caring for someone with alzheimers is horrendous even when you are at full strength yourself. Putting her somewhere where they have the resources, the time, and the patience to care for her is absolutely the right thing to do.

I worked as a CNA on an Alzheimer's unit and I fully support anyone that finally takes that route. That disease is unpredictable and dangerous.. it's not be at for family to care for them. They will eventually wake in the middle of the night Jr refuse to sleep and make it harder on you also. I say you do the nursing home.

Hypocrites are the worst shit.\n\nI quit my job and devoted all my time and energy to the care of my grandma when she was diagnosed. Did it for almost 3 years.

It doesn\u2019t make it ok, but they\u2019re probably lashing out because they\u2019re struggling to come to terms with their mother going into a facility.

Caring for someone with Alzheimer's as a sole untrained caregiver is incredibly hard, and can be dangerous for them and for you. Even if you were the most caregiving-oriented person in the world, it would be hard to impossible to do this on your own while working. Furthermore, when someone with dementia needs residential care, the earlier you can move them the better, so they have time to get used to their new environment while they still have some capability to adapt.\n\nSecond, your husband's siblings certainly have a lot of opinions, but no intention to contribute  any time or effort or money.

But for them to actually be involved that is flat no and dead silence. \n\nSo may I suggest you contact your MIL\u2019s primary care physician and/or the doctor treating her Alzheimer\u2019s to request referrals to a live in facility that includes specific housing/care for an Alzheimer\u2019s patient?   \n\nAlso check with your state/country resources as some offer information.  In the US I\u2019ve seen ads for various companies that help find appropriate housing. I\u2019ve no knowledge/experience with them so I presume those services are paid for somehow. \n\nMake an appointment if you can to arrive at say 1030 or 11am.  Reason being you want to request a tour of the dining room if patients eat communally.  You also want to see what they are being fed. \n\nOne thing you may find is your MIL will actually have a better quality of life in such a home as they will find ways to involve her through out the day.  \n\nIf your MIL has assets available I\u2019d suggest using those assets to cover the costs as needed. Your in-laws may also scream about it.  However unless they want to pony up their share of the cost split between all of you again they don\u2019t get to say diddle. \n\nBest wishes to you on finding the best solution for your family.", "My grammy lives in a nursing home after her alzheimers set in and she became a danger to herself. She has this awesome roomate named Virginia that keeps track of her and makes sure my grammy is doing well. They even have a built in church for the Christians so the nurses wheel her in the room during services. And before my aunt passed she visited grammy every single day. Its really not a bad situation if the nursing home is a good home", "NTA. Why are you the sole provider for MILs daily care when she has other children? Why does this all fall on you and not them? If they don\u2019t want the responsibility then the only fair and reasonable things to do is put her in a facility where she can get adequate care. This is not just your responsibility and the rest of her kids are a bunch of AHs for pushing this on you when they refuse to do it themselves. Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm! What happens when something does happen in your care? Will they just blame you for that too? This isn\u2019t your responsibility\u2026make her own children deal with it.", "Arguably it would be more kind to introduce her to that environment earlier on in her progression so that when she is highly confused she doesn't find the place completely foreign.", "Hopping on to say to OP you may look into these villages for alzheimer people, where they can live a mostly normal life with going shopping, meeting people and stuff, but under constant care. Nursing homes are good for people who can not take care of themselves anymore, but most alzheimerpeople are till close to the end mostly mobile and can do simple tasks when supervised, like you get a kid to do stuff, so maybe this is better for MIL. I love the idea behind these villages, but not so many people know about them and I want to spread awareness :)", "My mom actually had a good time in the joint. We called it the Bingo Dorm because for her that\u2019s what it was, a dorm with daily bingo.", "This!!! \n\nNTA", "Yes.\n\nTo put it differently, if the MIL had uncurable cancer and needed 24/7 specialised care, most people wouldn't bat a eye if OP placed her MIL in a Hospice. Just because it is an age related disease, doesn't mean people should have lesser care than any other disease. Not everyone have in them to care of others like that. And it is very unrealistic to expect OP and Husband replace 3-6, maybe 8 caretakers, nurses and whatever OPMIL would eventually require, when her Alzhiemers have progressed more.", "it sounds like the situation as it currently stands is not safe: if she\u2019s in danger any time she\u2019s left alone and op works out of the house once a week, how many instances of being alone for an 8 hour stretch is it going to take for something awful to happen? whether that\u2019s starting a fire, a fall, etc. that to me is the most pressing issue here and it needs to be solved. i would frame everything in these terms. \n\ni would have op\u2019s husband call a family\nmeeting with the siblings and lay out the facts of the situation: mom needs round the clock care and is in danger of seriously injuring herself, burning down the house, or more if she\u2019s left alone, which is inevitable with op and husband\u2019s work schedules. what is the kindest and best option here? \n\nalternatively if they\u2019re the kind of people who just won\u2019t see reason (which is probable given their objections to keeping their mom with them while insisting op and her husband continue to) just find a good nursing home and have her moved there.", "The funny thing is that AITA is notoriously 'stick-em-in-a-home' but it is actually the correct choice here (that or a 24/7 caretaker).  Alzheimer's is no joke, and I can't believe OP is doing a full-time caretaker role on top of working full-time.\n\nWorking from home does NOT mean 'unemployed', or 'available'.", "NTA As a former spousal caregiver who had to make that decision after 19 years- it's so difficult. I applaud you as caregiver, you have done a great job. The above advice is exactly what needs to happen- with a timeline. No more than 12 weeks. Being a caregiver to a family member is so difficult, and often vastly underappreciated & understood. No guilt in doing what is best for you and your MIL  Good luck, OP. \n\nPS Start researching NOW. If you are in the US, there are a few organizations that can help you make a decision on the facility. A Place for Mom is one that comes to mind. Good luck OP.", "Yup, blatantly say - she aint my mother. \n\nThese dicks don't actually care about her btw, they are almost certainly more worried about their inheritance or something.", "I wouldn't give #2 as an option.  My mother had in-home care and it still required a lot of supervision on our part.  Care agencies will send someone but they aren't always reliable, plus as OP's MIL deteriorates it will make it almost impossible for OP to keep her full time job working from home. Alzaheimer patients can become very combative and difficult to handle.", "100% this", "I like that she's the AH for not wanting to continue to care for their mother.", "This is the answer.", "Agreed with these choices, she is not your mother op and her constant care should not be falling on your shoulders. Either she goes into a well researched home for her own safety and your sanity, or they take care of their own mother as is THEIR responsibility. Honestly, the audacity of the siblings to have a go at you but also refuse to do an iota of care is astonishing. I would be reminding them this woman raised them and loved them and wiped their butts for them as babies. It's her turn for care now kids.", "I think they need to admit that a care home will be necessary eventually because a residential home can not be made safe and supportive enough once the disease progresses to a certain point. They need to accept that fact, pick the home, and GET ON THE WAITING LIST. Some of those lists are months of not years long. Getting on the list for a high quality home needs to be 1st on the priority list, then figuring out how to support OP until a space is available.", "Even with an in-home care giver a family member of mine caused about 30k worth of damage to the house before the realized it just wasn\u2019t possible to keep them in the house any longer even with resources to help.", ">Tell them there are 3 options: 1: Nursing home 2: She stays with you, but all of siblings will finance a 24/7 in-House care 3: Another sibling of hubby takes her in.  \n   \nBased on OP\u2019s comments around strangers in her home, I don\u2019t think that option 2 should be on the table. Go for two choices, A) if MIL\u2019s children want her to be in someone\u2019s home, then they can come to an agreement of where (with the exclusion of OP\u2019s house), and everyone pitches in financially to make it work, or B) OP and Husband (with input from the siblings as practical) find a nursing home that has the ability to properly meet MIL\u2019s needs.", "I disagree with option 2 because she has said that she doesn\u2019t want to have strangers invading her home. They offered to pay for the care if she moves in with another sibling, and they all declined.", "Spot on! The siblings don't want the responsibility of looking after MIL, nor do the want to contribute to the expense of her being cared for somewhere. What a selfish lot they are. OP is entitled to a life, a social life, a holiday and of course OP could also fall ill at some point and not be able to care for MIL. No it's time for MIL to be somewhere she is looked after and gets the care she needs as her condition worsens. OP you're NTA. Be proud of what you have done so far. It's more than the siblings have done. But now it's time to take care of yourself.", "Now I'm wondering: Are they paying OP to take care of her MIL?", "Yes, this so much.  Every other judgmental person is not at risk, and can\u2019t be bothered to help or accommodate.  Their words actually cement the justification to get mom the care she needs.  Certainly their livelihood isn\u2019t at risk so armchair judgment and quarterbacking is so easy. \n\nAlso I\u2019m stealing the scrub their buttholes with a rock comment.  You have a beautiful mind.", "She lived with us for 5 years. But in the beginning it wasn't such a big problem, as she was mostly self-sustained and lived with us mostly \"in case of accidents\". I only had bigger issues with taking care of her in the last 11-1,5 years.", "I agree.  She should put them each on shifts to watche their mother.  Then when they see how hard it is they will understand her position better.  Some people have a lot of nerve passing judgement especially when they aren't willing to do exactly what she has done for the last 5 years.", "I was planning on putting my grandma in one that literally I could step out on my balcony, and the nurses said they would wheel her out to wave and show I was there then I'd been over to help care for her. Her dementia didn't make her mean and violent, but she had a lot with medical. She wouldn't have hit 90 but quality over quantity. My family attacked me so hard.", "I partly disagree when the siblings already are saying, \"They have their own lives,\" \"it's not that much work,\" etc. They won't take responsibility but wipe it off on OP. \nSo an ultimatum that either they take over or MIL gets the full care she needs, so she isn't endangering herself and OP and husbands home., sounds fair.", "Actually, even if OP made the decision herself she would not be the AH as the rest of the family are not stepping up but expect her to shoulder the burden. \n\nAs others have suggested, OP needs to give the siblings their options and a deadline to make a decision. \n\nAt the end of the day, the best decision is for MIL to be placed in a nursing home. Her safety and well-being should be the top priority which can only be given by professionals who have been trained to work with the elderly and especially those with cognitive issues.", "My MIL had to make this decision about her own mother, and the positive difference it made for her mother was incredible. There were planned activities like singing and crafts, people for her to talk to, and excellent care from the staff. \n\nFor my MIL, not having to worry about her mother's safety and wellbeing and not having to wrangle her to do things like eat and drink meant their visits together were much more pleasant and relaxing. It was more quality time and less stress all around.", "This comment about moving an Alzheimer patient in earlier rather than later makes sense to me. It\u2019s their mother. They should make this decision. She is not your responsibility.", "This. By the time most people do it, it\u2019s too late AND not everywhere will take people so far down the dementia / Alzheimer\u2019s line.

It's better to place her in a facility earlier so she becomes  accustomed to it.", "As someone with a close relative with Alzheimer's, I can't agree more.  Get her in her new routine before things get past the point of her being able to live at home.  She'll also likely enjoy making new friends and the activities of a memory care center - things she probably can't do at your home.  Many also offer support groups where residents can share frustrations about living with their disease (an important outlet). If your family is so worried, they need to make time THEMSELVES to go visit her often at the memory care center and make sure she's getting family time and also being checked on.

Plus, when a child visits their elderly parent or grandparent in a home, it's usually a lot more relaxed which means they may enjoy each other's company instead of feeling resentful at constantly being in the positon of caretaker.", "My grandfather wandered off multiple times.

It's expensive, though. My employers don't use an agency. They pay us cash, much more than most caretakers earn.", "My mum refused care for months.

It broke my mils heart though she had such a loving relationship with her mum and she just faded away infront of her.\n\nI understand why she wanted to delay it she wanted to keep her mum in her home as long as possible but she did miss out on the community and group fun part she would have enjoyed, she loved crafting and old movies and things but she was too far gone when she got there to ever make any friends or join in. \n\nIt sounds so mean but pulling the trigger on the assisted living facility earlier rather than later can be so much kinder to your loved one.", "This is something that occurred to me, too. I kind of wish my late grandma (who had dementia) had been put in a home with things like this. She lived next door to my parents and aunt and uncle.

I don\u2019t blame them for anything at all, but I wish my grandma could have been at a place where they did stuff like this.

So that is still going to be a part time job for op probably even if she does end up in a home, which is probably the right move as I don't think one care or even two care givers will be enough with someone with such high needs, which will only get higher as time goes on.\n\n\nCan I ask in your opinion is it better for the couple you care for maybe as they're still together and in it together so to speak, I assume they will have been together a long time and those are the comfortable memories that seemed to endure when my mils mother was taken by dementia, she was always talking about things from 20-40 years ago as if it was yesterday, so I could imagine if your partner was still with you and familiar it may make you slightly more comfortable even if you do think it's 1978.
