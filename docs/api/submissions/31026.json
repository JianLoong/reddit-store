Food is food and if they were fussy eaters then their parents should have said prior so you could prepare, you already mentioned you asked about dietary requirements and no one had any but this would have been the perfect time for them to mention they are picky on the food they will eat and to politely ask you to provide something different for them at the dinner you organised\n\nTBH the majority of what they mentioned as Kids food is just junk, this is ok once in a while as a treat or a quick fix but they probably give in to their kids at meal times because they will refuse to eat anything else.

If people want to teach you about some things that became habits for them and their family, sure, but you are in no obligation to partake on them, particularly when they are harmful, like the one where apparently processed shitty food becomes \"kid's food\".

Sure, there are kids sections on menus in restaurants that usually have the items you listed as kids food. But other than that I never experienced that different food was made for kids (except for allergies and my vegetarian cousin). At home my mum cooked stuff that catered to my preferences while still being a balanced meal. At other peoples houses I ate the parts that I liked and my mum usually had a snack with her and also asked what the food was before we went there. One half of my extended family makes sure that at least some part of the meal is something that everybody eats and serves a lot of parts separate (so pasta in one bowl, sauce in the other) which I think is a great compromise as it's not really extra work but I am able to eat the pasta without the sauce I don't like.

Am German with non german migration history, have a child with a german, we do not serve him anything else. Don't know what this Leon and Lena were talking about, lots of people here just serve the kids whatever the adults eat. Also their comment about having to adapt to german food culture was bigoted, personally I wouldn't invite them again. You do NOT have to fully assimilate and are absolutely allowed to keep your own traditions. And regardless, this seems more like a differing parenting philosophy issue than a cultural misunderstanding. Leon and Lena think cooking their kids a whole separate meal is acceptable, lots of other people (many germans too) disagree with them.", "NTA I'm a German young adult. I've never seen a family were the kids got served something else (just because they were kids), let alone serving kids nuggets, or noodles with ketchup. That's not something you serve guests here, that's an unhealthy budget meal! If the event is child-focused they often serve spaghetti bolognese (with the noodles pre-cut), self-made pizza with lots of vegetables, or (if you're more traditional) K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle.\n\nI think, as soon as we could, we ate the normal meals that everyone else had. It is extremely rude to not even try the food you're served.\n\nIf families made extra food for children they come across a bit helicopter-parent-ish. And serving guests (kids included) noodles with ketchup, or nuggets would be considered \"cheap\".", "Bro people who only feed their kids nuggets and pizza are failing as parents and setting their kids up to fail. It's like a classic hallmark of bad parenting \n\n#(in the absence of a diagnosis like autism or actual food aversion disorders of course *don't come for me parents of food-averse kids*)\n\nNTA. Your kids will have an easier time in life because you're equipping them for adulthood", "NTA kids food?!?! How are they supposed to learn to try new things? Chicken nuggets, pizza? That's usa mom/dad works 80 hours a week type food. Wow.", "NTA\n\nThere are no kids meals in Germany or pretty much anywhere in Europe. I've only heard that it's somewhat more common in USA and UK.\n\nThat couple was weird. Nuggets, pizza and pasta with ketchup are definitely not typical German meals for children.", "Oh for heaven's sake -- American kids (we are talking about the US?) don't just eat fast food and pasta with ketchup. They eat regular meals. Or should. I can't believe the parents shamed you for that. If their kids will only eat McD's they should bring it themselves and be aware that they are probably creating lifelong health problems for them.", "NAH in my opinion.\n\nWhile a lot of people believe that kids food doesn\u2019t exist it\u2019s bad parenting and such. That isn\u2019t totally true in a party like setting.  Food is food when you are feeding your kids at home.\n\nIt gets trickier when you are feeding other people\u2019s kids. While you did ask if there were any allergies or food that is no go and they all said everything is normal.  While you might think a well baked salmon with rice and broccoli is a great meal that isn\u2019t going to fly with the kids you don\u2019t know. In the kids eyes I mean\n\nThe concept of kids food as pizza, nuggets, burgers, pasta, and such is that the majority of kids eat those things. So a lot of people will make those items to ensure all kids eat.  You can\u2019t always count on parent saying that kids aren\u2019t picky because a lot of times parents try to put kids in situations where the kids comfort level is taken away. They want to force kids to eat food they know kid won\u2019t eat and kids are trained to not be disrespectful to people they visit. So if a kid hates peas and parents know this. You make a dish that is loaded with peas then the kid either starves themselves or has to eat a meal with food that makes them sick. \n\nYou can slave away in the kitchen and make whatever you made.  However if this dish is something the kids never had or use ingredients they never tried.  They aren\u2019t going to be too keen to try it.  \n\nTo give an example one of my two favorite Indian Dishes are Buttered Chicken and chicken Tiki Masala. If I went to someone\u2019s house and that was served when I was a kid. I would not want to eat the dish. I never had it nor did I know what was in it.  The Irony being that Chicken Parmigiana was my favorite food as a kid.  All three of these dishes are about chicken smothered in a tomato sauce.  The difference is what spices are used.  If I didn\u2019t know what the components of the Indian dishes were I would be too afraid as a kid to try it.  An adult saying,\u201dthat they know I\u2019ll like it\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water. \n\nAgain the way you hosted the party is fine. It was up to the parents to mention if kids weren\u2019t going to eat what you made.", "By the entitlement I\u2019m guessing \u201cthis country\u201d is the United States. I was born in the middle of the USA and am the pickiest eater ever. My parents never let me have separate \u201ckid food.\u201d The only times there was an exception was with pasta and lasagna. I\u2019m allergic to tomatoes so I got pesto instead of marinara and got to eat whatever leftovers we had if we had lasagna. Those parents were just entitled.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm from Canada, I had not heard of your dish before, but when I looked up a picture it honestly looks like a basic meal (not trying to be offensive about what you cooked - it just doesn't look intimidating or like it might be super spicy or have any strong flavours or anything.)\n\nIf you had served spicy kimchi and octopus stew or something then I could understand them thinking you should have anticipated the kids might not want to eat that. But you served steak and eggs basically.", "Germany has a ton of migrants, \"what german kids eat\" doesn't mean anything because there's tons of German kids from all different backgrounds who eat all sorts of things. Also none of the things they listed are even German, that all sounds extremely British or American.\n\nDont' be friends with these people, they are extremely ignorant and xenophobic.", "Wait, so does this mean Lena is german in Colombia but wants you to adjust your cooking to what germans eat? Uh that's quite audacious", "Sorry for the confusion. We are colombian living I  Germany. Lena and Leon are german", "Yes! We have Turkish neighbors, and the little boy always chills at the stairs eating b\u00f6rek. He always offers my kids. It is really cute", "No we are  in Germany. We met the other two couples at the German course at the Volkshochschule", "I understand that part - what I'm wondering is are your friends German and assumed your dish would be \"too ethnic\" for kids, not realizing it's actually quite simple and kid friendly?\n\nIt doesn't matter, really, because your friends are wrong either way. I just find it bizarre that they weren't on your side immediately.", "Ahhhhhh that makes way more sense than where my brain went. Thank you for clarifying for me, regardless though lena and leon were the ones in the wrong."]}
