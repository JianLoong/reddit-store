{"id": 7564, "submission_id": "10ee0ww", "title": "AITA for not bringing enough pie?", "selftext": "I (23F) made a blueberry pie. My mom and I both ate a slice, and I gave a slice to my grandma. I was going to my bf\u2019s (23M) house later that day, so I texted him, \u201cdo you want a slice of pie?\u201d along with a picture of the pie where a piece was clearly missing. He responded saying, \u201cyes\u201d and I then said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring a slice for your mom and sister too.\u201d \n\nThat night, I went over to his house with my tupperware of pie slices. When it was time for dessert, my bf pulls the tupperware out of the fridge and says, \u201cthat\u2019s it? I told my mom and sister you were taking care of dessert.\u201d He thought the slices were too small. I told him that this is what was left of the pie after my mom, my grandma and I had some. I said since there didn\u2019t seem to be enough, I just wouldn\u2019t have any. They ate their pie and I thought that would be the end of that. \n\nThe next morning, my bf and I went for a walk and he said, \u201cI need to talk to you about the situation last night. You shouldn\u2019t show up to someone\u2019s house with a half-eaten pie. It\u2019s impolite and embarrassing.\u201d\n\nI was confused. First off, it was just a relaxed supper with his mom and sister. We\u2019re 2 years into our relationship at this point, it\u2019s not like I was coming over for the first time. Of course, if there had been other guests, I would have brought a whole pie or none at all. Second, my bf knew very well I wouldn\u2019t be bringing a whole pie because I texted him a picture beforehand and specifically used the word \u201cslice\u201d! \n\nI responded telling him just that, but he insisted that my actions were rude. He said something like, \u201ccome on, don\u2019t you know proper dinner etiquette?\u201d I said, \u201cwell maybe I don\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t raised like you, wealthy and having dinner parties with my parents\u2019 friends every weekend. I hardly ever had guests at my house growing up. Also, I specifically asked you if you wanted slices of pie and you said yes. If your mom and sister are offended or upset about this, you\u2019re at least partially at fault. If you weren\u2019t really paying attention to your texts, that\u2019s not my problem either.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t take any blame and stayed upset for a bit. I\u2019m assuming his mom must have said something to him and that\u2019s why he was so worked up over this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673966845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ee0ww/aita_for_not_bringing_enough_pie/", "score": 425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I like to bake larger dessert items (like cakes, cheesecake, or pies) for family dinners. I just did this at Xmas, I made a big cherry chocolate cake with buttercream frosting to the party we had with my mom's side of the family and then brought the remainder to dinner with my dad's side of the family. I've also done what OP did l, and offered to bring slices to friends or family I'm meeting up with so I don't end up eating the remaining dessert myself or throwing it away.\n\nIt would be kind of odd imo if it was like a leftover ham or turkey they brought, but that's mostly because my family would keep that stuff and use it to make turkey and noodles or ham and beans. I can think of a lot more savory dishes which are easy to reuse in different meals and aren't as unhealthy to eat multiple days or meals in a row. Desserts? Not really.", "I\u2019m sure it is cultural. I was raised that you don\u2019t show up empty handed, and you don\u2019t show up with partially eaten food.

He's basically telling you that unless you had a full pie, don't bring any at all.  So just tell him that and let it go.  Your kind intentions are lost on his mother so don't let it stress you.

He says she\u2019s taking care of desert lmao NTA but I do not bring a slice of anything if I don\u2019t have a Whole cake or pie it stays home and I bring ppl over to my house to help me eat it (one or two ppl) it\u2019s just how I was raised I think it is a thing with some families that it is considered rude to only bring a small amount of food to another\u2019s place. Take it from me talk to mom directly. Things get lost in translation and it\u2019s just easier to cut out the middle man bf when doing a get together at her place. 99% of misunderstands will be avoided that way.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is trouble and maybe his family is too.  He is incapable of reading and understanding.\n\n\n.", "You're definitely NTA, and I guess your boyfriend gets to never get offered a dessert that isn't perfect again. He can pick one up from the store/make one himself if he wants though.\n\nYou did show a lot of restraint by not saying \"*Can you please explain how you expected me to turn the slices of pie in the photo I sent into a complete pie\"*.", "NTA, but don't assume this is coming from anyone else unless you hear it from them.  This is just a misunderstanding, and it will pass.", "Weird reaction to free pie. I actually love these weird little posts here, relatively low stakes but really shows the differences in regions, cultures, age groups etc. I wouldn't bring partial dessert if I were invited to a dinner that was a \\*thing.\\* But dropping by my in-laws for a casual meal, with people I've known for awhile and am comfortable with, absolutely if I have leftover something they'd enjoy I'd bring it. Do you think that he's being weird about it on his own or did mom or sil say something? It just seems like such a bizarre thing to be offended enough about that he needed to have a conversation with you about it. NTA. Your bf is weird.", "NTA. How ungrateful. Throw the whole man away.", "He sounds exhausting! I would be rethinking ever making anything for him again and maybe even the relationship. NTA", "Maybe it's just me, but slices of pie don't really qualify as leftovers on the day the pie is cut. It's pie. It's meant to be shared slice by slice.\n\nIt's not like she ate half a salad and brought the remains of her bowl to be divvied between three people. Or \"gifted\" half an order of fast food french fries to his family.\n\nIf you need a whole homemade pie to be grateful for the gift of homemade pie, you need to check your homemade pie privilege. If you whine about any baker's gift, don't be surprised if they show up to future holiday meals with a store bought stand-in for their unappreciated work.\n\nE: NTA. He/his family don't deserve your pie as it stands.", "re think your boyfriend.. this is much deeper..", "Eh I don't necessarily know if I can call the mom and sister entitled. They may not have said anything at all and the bf was just projecting his feelings onto them. Or maybe even he lied and said OP said they were going to bring a pie so when what showed up was only a few slices they made some comments about that.", "omg this is so true.  and i'm also now just thinking, how could the boyfriend, mother, and sister just sit there while they fatten themselves up with pie, while she just sits there not eating.  horrifyingly impolite.  they are talking about manners???", "I see what you did there! \ud83e\udd23", "If he and OP stay together, she should be aware this is something he'll do anytime she doesn't fit his mould: \"how could you do X, don't you know nobody does Y, did you have to embarrass me by doing Z?\" \n\nIs OP sure she wants this used as a metaphorical big stick for the next however many years?", "Better yet, go straight to mom and say something like \"I apologize about the miscommunication the other day. I told bf I had a few pieces of pie left I can bring over. Bf said you thought I was bringing a full pie and were surprised that it wasn't. I'll make sure it gets communicated better next time\"\n\nThat way when you find out mom knows nothing about it and bf is blowing it out of proportion, he doesn't get to back track", "It could have been a small pie plate.  The ones that fit the pillsbury pie crust aren\u2019t very big. I think 6 slices is about right for a pie that size.", "Yup.\n\nI showed up at a friend\u2019s house once with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and one of the adults there said, \u201cChocolate chip cookies *again*?\u201d\n\nSeeing how the previous two times I had brought cookies there they were not chocolate chip cookies, I was not amused.\n\nAnd that friend\u2019s family has not received any cookies of any type ever again.", "Absolutely. If I bake a dozen cupcakes and only bring you 6, is it rude?", "> check your home pie privilege \n\nLolll! Brand new sentence.", "NTA.\n\n Your boyfriend? UGH. He likes to correct you and put you down over nothing. Pay attention to how he treats you. Have a think.", "Eh, I grew up in the 1960s having dessert every day at supper.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t what I would call fancy desserts. Canned fruit, Jello, canned fruit in the Jello (no whipped cream on the Jello), two home baked cookies or brownies. Ice cream for Sunday dinner. Sometimes gingerbread in the winter. Occasionally on Friday nights a layer cake, made from a mix, to celebrate the arrival of the weekend.\n\nMost of what we had for dessert is stuff people might have for a snack today, except for the layer cakes, probably.\n\nMy parents were very old fashioned even for the 60s and didn\u2019t deviate much from the way they had been raised in the 30s & 40s. Supper was almost always a main course, two vegetables and a starch\u2014rice or potatoes\u2014plus a salad and dinner rolls, and then dessert.\n\nSo we had dessert, but it wasn\u2019t like our or cake or ice cream every night.", "This is drama for the sake of drama.", "This statement doesn't hold water.  She said she opted not to have any because *he* thought the pieces were \"too small\" not because she only brought 3 slices.", "But she wasn't bringing dessert for dinner (as far as she knew) - she was just bringing pie for her bf+fam to enjoy at a later time.", "Translated: \"Ew, you spent time and effort to make us happy *again*?! Please take your skills elsewhere.\"\n\nI'm honestly not much of a fan of sweets, but I low-key lose my shit when someone gives me baked goods. It's not just about the end product; it's about the time and care that went into creating it.", "Only if you're dating someone in OP's boyfriend's family.", "I think it depends on your relationship with them and how casual the situation is. If it was like a nice sit-down family dinner at the parents house that they\u2019d invited her to, I could see it being weird to being leftovers. It would seem like an afterthought or like you didn\u2019t want to put in any effort. I got the impression this was just a normal casual night hanging out with her boyfriend at his house and she happened to have some pie left so she brought it. It sounds like he still lives at home so I wouldn\u2019t expect her to bring something *every* time she has dinner at their house. I mean I have a friend coming over later this week cause I had a free charcuterie board coupon and if she showed up like \u201cI had some leftover birthday cake so I just brought it\u201d I\u2019d be like Hell Yeah!!", "would you show up at your own parent's house with a half eaten pie from home that your family just could not finish?", "I\u2019m not sure. Probably not. My fam lives very far away though so it\u2019s never been a consideration. \n\nThat said, my partner\u2019s parents both live nearby and we do visit for dinner regularly and no, I wouldn\u2019t take leftovers. I\u2019d *send* leftovers over with my partner to drop off when he picks up his kiddo but I wouldn\u2019t show up for a dinner with something that had already been dug into. \n\nAs I said though, I don\u2019t think the OP is an AH for it. Maybe it\u2019s a bit uncouth for that family but it\u2019s still not AH.", "Er... Yes, I would. And they'd be fine with that cause they're not rude/entitled/snobs."]}
