{"id": 7564, "submission_id": "10ee0ww", "title": "AITA for not bringing enough pie?", "selftext": "I (23F) made a blueberry pie. My mom and I both ate a slice, and I gave a slice to my grandma. I was going to my bf\u2019s (23M) house later that day, so I texted him, \u201cdo you want a slice of pie?\u201d along with a picture of the pie where a piece was clearly missing. He responded saying, \u201cyes\u201d and I then said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring a slice for your mom and sister too.\u201d \n\nThat night, I went over to his house with my tupperware of pie slices. When it was time for dessert, my bf pulls the tupperware out of the fridge and says, \u201cthat\u2019s it? I told my mom and sister you were taking care of dessert.\u201d He thought the slices were too small. I told him that this is what was left of the pie after my mom, my grandma and I had some. I said since there didn\u2019t seem to be enough, I just wouldn\u2019t have any. They ate their pie and I thought that would be the end of that. \n\nThe next morning, my bf and I went for a walk and he said, \u201cI need to talk to you about the situation last night. You shouldn\u2019t show up to someone\u2019s house with a half-eaten pie. It\u2019s impolite and embarrassing.\u201d\n\nI was confused. First off, it was just a relaxed supper with his mom and sister. We\u2019re 2 years into our relationship at this point, it\u2019s not like I was coming over for the first time. Of course, if there had been other guests, I would have brought a whole pie or none at all. Second, my bf knew very well I wouldn\u2019t be bringing a whole pie because I texted him a picture beforehand and specifically used the word \u201cslice\u201d! \n\nI responded telling him just that, but he insisted that my actions were rude. He said something like, \u201ccome on, don\u2019t you know proper dinner etiquette?\u201d I said, \u201cwell maybe I don\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t raised like you, wealthy and having dinner parties with my parents\u2019 friends every weekend. I hardly ever had guests at my house growing up. Also, I specifically asked you if you wanted slices of pie and you said yes. If your mom and sister are offended or upset about this, you\u2019re at least partially at fault. If you weren\u2019t really paying attention to your texts, that\u2019s not my problem either.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t take any blame and stayed upset for a bit. I\u2019m assuming his mom must have said something to him and that\u2019s why he was so worked up over this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673966845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ee0ww/aita_for_not_bringing_enough_pie/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't going to a dinner party, you were bringing him and his mom and sister some leftover pie slices as a treat, which you clearly stated and even included a picture. If he misinterpreted that to mean a whole pie, that's on him.  I can't believe it was even an issue after you left. Is his mom usually so uptight and snobby about things?

You also could've left the pie at home.\nIf it was a joke like \"the slices were so small, I wish there would've been more\" it's a different scenario, but this was straight up rude. They should be greatful for what they have and get.\nAlso am I the only one who finds it strange that some people eat dessert every day?

They were having trouble because they saw it as rude to eat dessert in front of her while she didn't have anything.\n\nIf you are bringing dessert - either make sure there's enough for everyone at the meal or announce on arrival who you are expecting to have it.  I'm not sure why OP didn't immediately announce she wasn't having dessert (rather than waiting through the drama of them trying to figure out how to make the pie serve 4 people).", "If it was like a formal family dinner I could see it coming off a little weird but for a casual, normal dinner that you just happened to be joining them for I don\u2019t see a problem.", "As someone who grew up middle class in the Midwest, I don't think it's odd either honestly. I like to bake larger dessert items (like cakes, cheesecake, or pies) for family dinners. I just did this at Xmas, I made a big cherry chocolate cake with buttercream frosting to the party we had with my mom's side of the family and then brought the remainder to dinner with my dad's side of the family. I've also done what OP did l, and offered to bring slices to friends or family I'm meeting up with so I don't end up eating the remaining dessert myself or throwing it away.\n\nIt would be kind of odd imo if it was like a leftover ham or turkey they brought, but that's mostly because my family would keep that stuff and use it to make turkey and noodles or ham and beans. I can think of a lot more savory dishes which are easy to reuse in different meals and aren't as unhealthy to eat multiple days or meals in a row. Desserts? Not really.", "I\u2019m sure it is cultural. I was raised that you don\u2019t show up empty handed, and you don\u2019t show up with partially eaten food. But I was also raised that if you borrow something, you return it in better condition than you got it. Be that a vehicle  you fill with gas and get washed or a tractor you replace a tire on or whatever.\n\nMidwest US. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Me either. It wasn\u2019t a formal dinner it was a weekday dinner where op had some leftover pie.", "Yes exactly. Leftover dessert is normal/nice to bring. And even some side dishes. I remember last year my MIL made a huge container of chicken salad for my husband and I when we were visiting, and then brought the leftovers (about 1/2 the container) to my SILs for lunch the next day.", "I was raised like that, too. From California. But minus the left over part. She asked if he wanted a slice of pie that was clearly already eaten, he said yes. She offered a slice to sister and mom, too. That\u2019s what she said she had. That\u2019s what she brought. She wasn\u2019t responsible for desert. She didn\u2019t \u201ccome to dinner with half eaten pie\u201d she brought a treat to share.", "I agree it's rude to show up with leftovers at a dinner party, but not if you're just coming to hang out. At least not if it's dessert.", "Yeah, agreed. If they hadn't discussed it first, and OP hadn't shown her BF exactly what she was bringing, then I can see bringing a half eaten pie as being rude. \n\nBut that's not what happened here. The BF knew exactly what OP offered to bring. Which she didn't even need to do in the first place.\n\nIf he's embarrassed or feels anything negative about what OP brought, that's entirely on him, not OP.", "I absolutely would never bring a half eaten dessert if I was responsible for bringing desert lol. But I\u2019m not going to skip asking bf and fam if they want a slice of a left over pie at a small family dinner (assuming this is just a normal dinner)"]}
