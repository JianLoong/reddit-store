I was going to my bf\u2019s (23M) house later that day, so I texted him, \u201cdo you want a slice of pie?\u201d along with a picture of the pie where a piece was clearly missing. He responded saying, \u201cyes\u201d and I then said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring a slice for your mom and sister too.\u201d \n\nThat night, I went over to his house with my tupperware of pie slices. When it was time for dessert, my bf pulls the tupperware out of the fridge and says, \u201cthat\u2019s it? I told my mom and sister you were taking care of dessert.\u201d He thought the slices were too small. I told him that this is what was left of the pie after my mom, my grandma and I had some. I said since there didn\u2019t seem to be enough, I just wouldn\u2019t have any. They ate their pie and I thought that would be the end of that. \n\nThe next morning, my bf and I went for a walk and he said, \u201cI need to talk to you about the situation last night. You shouldn\u2019t show up to someone\u2019s house with a half-eaten pie. It\u2019s impolite and embarrassing.\u201d\n\nI was confused. First off, it was just a relaxed supper with his mom and sister. We\u2019re 2 years into our relationship at this point, it\u2019s not like I was coming over for the first time. Of course, if there had been other guests, I would have brought a whole pie or none at all. Second, my bf knew very well I wouldn\u2019t be bringing a whole pie because I texted him a picture beforehand and specifically used the word \u201cslice\u201d! \n\nI responded telling him just that, but he insisted that my actions were rude. He said something like, \u201ccome on, don\u2019t you know proper dinner etiquette?\u201d I said, \u201cwell maybe I don\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t raised like you, wealthy and having dinner parties with my parents\u2019 friends every weekend. I hardly ever had guests at my house growing up. Also, I specifically asked you if you wanted slices of pie and you said yes. If your mom and sister are offended or upset about this, you\u2019re at least partially at fault. If you weren\u2019t really paying attention to your texts, that\u2019s not my problem either.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t take any blame and stayed upset for a bit. I\u2019m assuming his mom must have said something to him and that\u2019s why he was so worked up over this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673966845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ee0ww/aita_for_not_bringing_enough_pie/", "score": 1374, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I like to bake larger dessert items (like cakes, cheesecake, or pies) for family dinners. I just did this at Xmas, I made a big cherry chocolate cake with buttercream frosting to the party we had with my mom's side of the family and then brought the remainder to dinner with my dad's side of the family. I've also done what OP did l, and offered to bring slices to friends or family I'm meeting up with so I don't end up eating the remaining dessert myself or throwing it away.\n\nIt would be kind of odd imo if it was like a leftover ham or turkey they brought, but that's mostly because my family would keep that stuff and use it to make turkey and noodles or ham and beans. I can think of a lot more savory dishes which are easy to reuse in different meals and aren't as unhealthy to eat multiple days or meals in a row. Desserts? Not really.", "I\u2019m sure it is cultural. I was raised that you don\u2019t show up empty handed, and you don\u2019t show up with partially eaten food.

He's basically telling you that unless you had a full pie, don't bring any at all.  So just tell him that and let it go.  Your kind intentions are lost on his mother so don't let it stress you.
