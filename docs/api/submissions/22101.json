{"id": 22101, "submission_id": "14yhdci", "title": "AITA for asking my mother for help when I found out I was being made homeless?", "selftext": "Edit: Thanks for everyone\u2019s feedback. I\u2019m overwhelmed at all the support and advice, especially in terms of housing and being made homeless. I have a good plan now and will contact citizens advice and possibly a lawyer for more information on our situation.\nIn terms of my mother I firmly believe she has some form of mental illness. She refuses to take medication though and denies even the idea of mental illness. I think the best course of action is to limit contact from now on. \n\n\nSo I discovered the property I rent has been sold and the new landlord wants us out. The old landlord did not tell us the property was for sale or that it had been sold. We found out the hard way when a surveyor let themselves in to check the property a few days ago. We began moving things into storage but in the meantime I reached out to my mom to ask if I could stay with her for a couple weeks until we found somewhere else to move in to. Her words were \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather see you homeless than have you move back in with me.\u201d\nIt\u2019s fine that she doesn\u2019t ever want me back there so I asked if I could at least store a couple boxes of my valuables there in the meantime. This seemed to open a whole can of worms. She began berating me, saying how all I do is use her like everybody else and how I don\u2019t love or care about her. \nI apologised and said I would just ask a friend to watch my stuff, no big deal. She then began saying how I was getting her down by the fact I was going to be homeless and I only had myself to blame but how I also didn\u2019t think about how this would impact her. She said it was upsetting and shameful to hear that her only child was going to be homeless.  She was crying and saying how I never think about her or how she feels and I\u2019m only out to use her. \n\nWhat\u2019s annoying is when I lived with her I paid for everything. I paid all her bills and bought her a new and expensive oven when hers broke only for her to sell it and buy a cheaper one with the money. I bought her food shopping too and paid her petrol for her car. These were the terms I had to abide by to be able to live with her. If I did not buy food or pay the bills I would starve. We lived quite rurally so there wasn\u2019t anywhere else I could go.\nWhen I got my own place in town she would frequently turn up and dump all her stuff here while she went out to meet friends. \n\nI just feel like I am somehow a terrible person and really don\u2019t want to talk to her again if i make her feel that awful.", "created_utc": 1689244939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yhdci/aita_for_asking_my_mother_for_help_when_i_found/", "score": 988, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I really recommend calling an eviction lawyer, it\u2019s illegal in most places to kick a tenant out on such short notice.", "Cut her loose, she doesn't deserve the title an you don't deserve the stress of dealing with this AH.", "NTA your mother is a narcissist.\nShe got mad at you because you might be homeless and that\u2019s \u201cgetting her down\u201d\nWhile refusing to help you AT ALL.\nShe\u2019s dogpiling onto your situation and making it about HER.\nI would say you shouldn\u2019t talk to her - not because she gets upset -it\u2019s because she makes everything ABOUT HER", "SHE is the AH. Horrible mother for saying that and mocking you basically. You paid her bills and bought her an oven and all she can say is that she is ashamed and sad that you will be homeless and then made it all about her and her feelings? SICK... NTAH", "NTA given the info provided.", "Your mom uses you and doesn\u2019t want to help you. You aren\u2019t a bad person for asking for help. You aren\u2019t a bad person for having needs. You aren\u2019t a bad person for your landlord selling your home out from under you. While your mom technically has the right to say no, you have every right to ask. \n\nNTA.", "NTA if she can't be at least emotionally supportive as mother then what value does this relationship have? \n\nShe is making your problems all about her. That's a narcissistic trait. Sounds like she has emotionally trained you to feel guilty about basically everything because it \"affects\" her. \n\nDo you feel like a burden to people, because all your life you've been told what a burden you are on her? So now you can't ask for help and can only ask her. If so, then this is the negative feedback loop you are trapped in.\n\nIt's all wrong, you need to stop contacting her and completely focus on yourself. You are valid. Your problems are valid. You asking a parent or friends and family for help is not wrong. Her mentality is wrong.\n\nI'm sorry you are losing your home. This is a difficult thing for you to figure out on your own. I hope you have some sort of support at least emotionally.", "NTA. Op. And just so you know you can always end the call. Rude? Maybe, but effective. Ideally would be to go NC with your mom but that\u2019s your choice. \nYou can tell her \u201cit you again revert the situation and start talking about yourself I\u2019m going to finish the call\u201d and follow if needed. \nI did it once. After explaining that this one topic is out of discussion. Do not ask, do not mention. Guess what she did? She wasn\u2019t mentioning it again. But your mom probably needs few more examples. \nYes op what I\u2019m telling you is rude to do and might be considered ah, but your mom is narcissistic and self-absorbed. And definitely needs a wake-up call", "NTA Your mom is a (likely mentally ill) piece of dog shit. Which is not in any way your fault.", "No \u201cseems\u201d about it, it\u2019s unbelievably harsh. Like unless OP is a monster and leaving out those details, it\u2019s cartoonishly evil.", "Is your mom...ok?  She seemed to go straight from 0 to 60.  And who tells their kid they'd rather they be homeless than live with them and makes their homelessness all about herself.  And then complain about the optics of them being homeless.\n\nShe sounds unwell, but you are definitely NTA.", "Well, I guess if she ever finds herself in need of help in her older years you have your answer for her right there, NTA", "NTA - Your mother used a whole host of thinking errors in her response to you.  Redirection, blaming, victimization to name a few.    She also sounds like a narcissist, which can be devastating for the person on the receiving end of their actions.  I am sorry you have to deal with this, and your situation is by no means your fault.  Life just sometimes deals us a crappy hand, which doesn't define us...how we respond to it is the important part.", "This is illegal NTA", "Ahhh yes...you're being evicted, what an ordeal for *her*. \ud83d\ude44 NTA, your mom's self-centered as hell.", "NTA. Your Mom sounds like a narcissist. I am hopeful you can find other shelter and not have to subject yourself again to her abuse. Godspeed.", "That's not fucking gaslighting.", "That's not gaslighting. Being emotionally manipulative and making the entire situation about herself and her emotions is something that narcissists do, but it's not gaslighting. \n\nShe isn't trying to make OP doubt her reality and question her sanity, which is what gaslighting is.", "Fully agree. When I was buying my apartment from previous owner I had to let live tenants there until their lease ended (luckily it was only a month and a half after purchasing it).", "Oh honey, NTA. You mother is emotionally abusing and manipulating you. And they can\u2019t just kick you out of your place. When the owner sold, they had to acknowledge whether or not there are any current tenants/leases. If they lied, that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nSorry, your mom is just a narcissist. \n\nOh, boo hoo, she's sad you're going to be homeless? Damn, too bad there isn't something she could do about that. I don't think she could have made that whole situation about herself any harder if her life depended on it.", "BC Canada here. 100% same deal. Land surveyors can enter private property without permission.", "OP, I am so sorry to hear this. I can imagine and understand that this is difficult for you I'm so glad to hear you turned out ok! I just wanted to offer some sympathy because it's hard enough being raised by a single parent, but one with BPD is another level. \n\nBut you got this! Best of luck!", "Snopes literally confirmed my post.", "Also, you can just literally not leave and just continue paying rent. It will take approximately 12 months for them to get eviction notices etc which is plenty of time to get a new place.", "NTA Sounds like your mom is carrying a whole bunch of very old stuff about feeling taken advantage of.  Don\u2019t take it personally.  It\u2019s clear from your post you\u2019ve tried to be considerate and get along with her.  She needs therapy to separate her old stuff from today and her relationship but she won\u2019t be receptive to that.  When talking to her stay calm, counter her accusations with the truth calmly, and don\u2019t get caught up in any drama.  Remember she\u2019s got a painful history that has nothing to do with you and again, don\u2019t take it personally.", "Also check out  r/raisedbynarcissists.", "Not relevant to the conflict, but I can correct you on the surveyor. They are legally allowed to enter private property in the course of their duties. (At least in my country). However most surveyors I know would have made the request of the landowner that the tenants be informed and asked for permission, even is it's not required.\n\nI agree that they should have had to follow more process to be evicted though.\n\nNTA. OP is allowed to ask her mom to take them in for a few weeks.", "I dont think anywhere outside of US, future landlords have access to that much information about their tenants.", "Nta", "Yep. In many parts of the world your rights as an existing tenant will survive the sale of the property - Eg if a property is sold 3 months into a 6 month lease, the new owner has to honour the remaining 3 months", "> They cannot just kick you out. If the lease is month to month, the new owner must give a 30 day notice at least\n\nAnd that's the US. In Europe, e.g. Germany, the situation would be even better for OP. You'd probably be looking at around a year to break this lease, *if* you are allowed to break it *at all*.", "> In the States, when a leased property sells, the new owner is required by law to honor any valid leases until they expire. They cannot just kick you out.\n\nSame in Australia.", "OP is NTA, the so-called \"mom\" is."]}
