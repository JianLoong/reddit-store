This seems unreasonably harsh even for a mom that thinks you should be independent.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you are but in most areas landlords can\u2019t just kick you out.

I wouldn't talk to her again either.", "NTA. You might be homeless and your mother thinks she is the victim? How self-centered can a person be?\n\n On a more important note, check if you really have to move. The property changing hands should not matter. What king of lease did you have with the old owner?", "INFO: When did you last talk to her before this request, and what was the context?", "I don\u2019t know where you are, but you need to check property laws in your area. Many countries have rules that protect renters in the case of a sale of the property. \n\nAs for your mum, your NTA for asking for her help, but it honestly sounds like she\u2019s got a lot of narcissistic behaviours up her sleeve.

Is she not a good mom or did you do something to tarnish the relationship?", "My first thought is what your mom said sounds like a bpd (borderline personality disorder) rant - do you know if she has bpd? There's a book called 'Understanding the borderline mother' by Christine Ann Lawson that may help you figure it out if you don't know. Not that she'd be likely to want treatment for it, but it may make situations like this one easier for you to parse in the future. If she shows no sign of bpd, it could just be that she's abusive - in any case it sounds like she has a hard time seeing things from any perspective other than how things affect her. I'm sorry your mom doesn't have your back in such a difficult situation. NTA, but I'd also focus more on the case you might have regarding wrongful eviction as others have suggested.", "NTA.

You are equating money spent as proof of love. She's NOT saying you didn't financially support her, she's saying that you don't 'love her or care about her' which is much more personally intimate. Sounds like she's looking for your interest and involvement in her daily life, her thoughts and her feelings. Conversation and time spent together. There's a big difference between Taking Care of someone, and Caring About Them.  If all you are is the 'dutiful' child, who only shows up when you need something, or she has a problem to fix... then she may be feeling unloved and neglected. Sometimes people need to HEAR it said; communicate your actual feelings with actual words, because they don't always understand when you use 'actions' to demonstrate how you feel about them.", "NTA\n\nIs your mom Hillary Clinton? \n\nhttps://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/3840x2160/4856528-Hillary-Clinton-Quote-Women-have-always-been-the-primary-victims.jpg", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The \"didn't you think about how it would look for ME if you were homeless\" is about as heartless, narcissistic, and compassionless as you can get.\n\nThis is an international subreddit, and people are from all over. But in my country (USA), in most states, renters are 1) required to be notified of the property changing hands, 2) required to be provided ample notice for eviction, and eviction has to be with cause, and 3) new landlords cannot evict existing tenant's and must abide by the previous lease.\n\nIf homeless here means your lease is up and isn't being renewed, well you are out of luck there. But if this is in the middle of an existing lease and you weren't notified, I'd probably make sure you get all of that in writing and reach out to a lawyer.\n\nNTA", "Your mother sounds like a massive narcissist.
