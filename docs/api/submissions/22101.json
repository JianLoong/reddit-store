Someone who has BPD and is untreated. Also the not believing in it is very common for untreated. Best recommendation I have is to set strict boundaries in place overall that she is not allowed to cross and there will be clear consequences for crossing them.\n\nYou're NTA; but look into the legality of your new landlord kicking you out suddenly.

It's great that you paid via bank transfer though as you have proof of regularly paying over a period of time. If you still have a branch of your high street bank near you, ask them to print out a copy of any payments made to your landlord from the date you moved in (you can also do it via online banking/your banking app, but they will have it on proper headed paper if its done in branch).\n\nAlso as you're in the UK, please get in contact with both Crisis and Shelter. They are charities for those experiencing homelessness. Also contact your local council, as they will have a housing team who will be able to help, as this is an illegal eviction.", "Gotta love when they accuse you of using them just a few days after going out of your way to do them a favor.
