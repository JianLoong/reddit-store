When I got married to my ex I started attending their family's church to be respectful and to be part of the family and my evil ex MIL used to use the prayer request clipboard as a weapon whenever she was mad at me...it was a humiliating experience to be sitting in a packed church and have the pastor read my name off a list praying \"for those who have fallen away from Christ\"...I certainly had not but that's how some people use religion and it unfortunately pushes people away.
