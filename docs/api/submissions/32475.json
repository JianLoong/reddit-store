Before I explain the step dad part let me say that me and my husband (27y m)  both have separated parents and they have remarried. So this baby will have 4 pairs of grandparents. Me and husband agreed that the baby would call the bio grandparents (grandma, grandpa, tata or nana) whatever they choose (the grandparent) and the step parents would be called by their name or referenced by their name until baby is older and can make a nickname or see what they would like to call them. My mom recently became feral during a conversation we had about this because she knows her husband will be \u201churt\u201d if I tell him not to reference himself as papa and say we\u2019re just doing first name right now. \n\nI told her first of all with all due respect im not responsible for a grown man\u2019s feelings and I will not be guilt tripped about his feelings. I told her what if the baby wants to call their dad papa ? She was quiet. I said I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s not papa, he will be called either by his first name or a nickname the baby makes for him when she\u2019s a bit older or what they are comfortable with. My mother thinks that I\u2019m wrong because he\u2019s been there for me and we have a good relationship. Which I told her if being there for me came with strings attached and I had debt owed to him then I would have never accepted the relationship. Also with respect to the baby\u2019s grandpas that are living and well and also apart of me and my husband\u2019s life I think it\u2019s only right to keep them as grandpa especially if the baby sees him (step dad) more. Quick add in my mom and her husband own their own business and have more freedom then our other parents and I don\u2019t want the baby to get confused if the other grandparents are not always available to get together because of their jobs. \n\nI also mentioned that to her but she became so feral saying she will have the baby call her by her name then and if I\u2019m going to have all these rules she won\u2019t visit. I had advised her nothing she is saying right now is going to make me change my mind. This is my baby and this is what I wish for he will not be called papa just because his own bio grandkids call him that it\u2019s not going to happen here. I also reminded her if she wishes not to visit because of my rules or boundaries I will have, then so be it but I will not allow her to use her husbands feelings as a weapon against me to change my mind.

You need to stop using your kid to set some weird, tacit relationship boundaries. The kid doesn't care that these are you step-parents - they are simply another grandparent so long as they treat the child like any one of their grandchildren. \n\nYou're also imagining confusion that is unlikely to exist - kids get that different family members have different lives. I grew up with one grandparent in my home, and other grandparents that we visited. There was no confusion. They were all my grandparents, they just had slightly different roles in my life because of their lives.\n\nYour mom also needs to dial it back. This is not something to create a family rift over. The kid will form their own relationships and memories of each person, regardless of what they are called.", "My kids call my mother\u2019s husband PawPaw even though he married my mother a year or so after my daughter was born, and they call my ex-wife\u2019s Stepfather \u201cPapa\u201d even though he married her mother when she was 11.\n\nYTA", "YTA, this seems like such a weird hill to die on. I had extra grandparents from remarriages and they each had their own nickname (Gran, Grandma, Nana, Nan, etc) and the possibilities are endless when you add in different language options. If you want the bio ones to get their preference then fine but there are SO many options and no need for hierarchy. It feels spiteful to use their real name or wait years for the kids to somehow magically figure it out themselves (which they won\u2019t, putting that on kids is cruel because you\u2019re forcing them to be involved in your drama).", "Yta.  It\u2019s completely your choice, but IMO, you\u2019re for sure the AH.  My daughter also has four sets of grandparents.  Not including her great grandparents.  She has Papa Bob, Papa Joe, Papa Doug and Papa Mike.  They\u2019re all Papa\u2019s because they love her and she loves them.  You mention the divorces, which result in blended families, but you don\u2019t seem to keen to actually blend.", "Obvi you\u2019re entitled to have your child call anyone whatever you wish, but why be an asshole about the grandparents, both bio and step - wanting to love and cherish your child enough that they WANT to be called papa \n\nYTA", "YTA. Kids are not as easily confused as you seem to think they are.\n\nMy kid has 4 grandpas and 3 grandmas (me and the kid's dad are separated, the kid's dad's parents are separated, grandma dad's side has a new partner, I myself have a new partner whose parents are also grandma and grandpa) and there has never been ANY confusion. Heck, the newest set of grandparents got in our lives when my kid was 3 and a half years old, we started referring to them as Grandpa/Grandma \\[lastname\\] and that's what the kid started calling them.\n\nWhat you are doing is deliberately pushing away a stepparent from the grandfather role solely because you seem to have some sort of misconception about children, or because you just have issues, no clue, however.. It servers NO ONE's purpose but your own. Your child literally is lucky enough to have an additional person in their life who will love them unconditionally, and you're already trying to create a distance that has no business doing there. And for what? Who does it hurt? Because if you honestly think that your child will be the first child on the planet who will be confused by one of their grandparents being called \"papa\", or the idea that not all grandparents are around an equal amount, then either you think your child will be insanely stupid or you have no idea how children work.\n\nSo let me ask you.. What is really the problem here? Cause the only one seeing a problem and subsequently making a problem.. Is you. And for what?", "I gotta go with YTA. I personally grew up with four sets of grandparents from exactly the same situation, and both step and bio were Grandpa or Grandma to me. This decision to separate bio and step seems somewhat to be coming out of nowhere since I didn't see anything in your post about strained relationships. \n\nIt just seems hateful to me, and I doubt that's the sort of thing you want your child to emulate.", "YTA\n\nI'm in almost the same position. I fully do not recognize that my step-dad is anything other than my mom's 2nd husband. However, I grew up with the only grandpa I ever knew being my grandmother's 3rd husband who she married well after all her kids were born. \n\nSo, you'd never ever hear me calling my step dad anything other than his name. At the same time, I have zero objection to having my kids call him grandpa. \n\nYour choice is more family or divided family. Why choose divided when more is an option. *IF* there's extenuating circumstances, that'd be different. But, if he's not a jerk who shouldn't ever be called grandpa, then yes YTA.", "YTA. My kids have extra sets of grandparents, as did I. I taught kindergarten for a decade and hosted annual grandparents day celebrations. Many of the kids had extra grandparents. Some had all four sets show up for grandparents day and even with 20 kids all bringing all their grandparents, it still wasn\u2019t hard to keep track. Absolutely none of those many families treated the step grandparents (in good standing) so unkindly. If I can keep track of an entire classroom\u2019s many sets of grandparents, you can easily differentiate between four sets of people who have all been parts of your lives for years. \n\n1. You may not get to decide what your kid calls even the bio grandparents. Kids latch on to things in early speech development and stick to them. If your mother, for example, always said \u201cyum yum\u201d when feeding the baby, the kid might just speak somewhere out of the blue and now her name is yum yum. \n\n2. There are so many names out there that the reasonable thing to do would be to ask all the bio grands what they would like to be called if the kid doesn\u2019t create something different. Then, tell the steps that those four names are off limits, and they can try to refer to themselves as grandparent nicknames they like other than those. Tell them all that the baby will call them what the baby calls them even if it\u2019s not the name they hope for. \n\nYou need to relax a little and let go of trying to control things that don\u2019t need controlling. You will have your hands plenty full without getting all in a tizzy over something so unimportant that also happens to suck the joy out of people with whom you claim to have a good relationship.", "This seems very petty of you and your husband, honestly. Not sure why you care so much.\n\nEdit - YTA.", "YTA. If he picks a name none of the other grandfathers picked then what if the issue?", "YTA\n\nI'm confused why this is something that you are willing to start a family feud over. Why did you sit down and decide this if for no other reason then to draw lines in the family. This should be a happy occasion and you are turning it into a fight.  It's subtly telling your child that there relationship with Bob less then the relationship with Grandma.  Especially since he isn't going to Grandpa.\n\nChildren's lives are only made better by the more people who love them.  Two grandmas or four grandmas......it's all good.\n\nI'm a step grandma.  I'm a grandma in every sense of the word.  Some kids call me by my given name (the older ones who who were born when I just came into the family) and some kids call me grandma.  There is nothing wrong with either name but its' not one I would pick a fight with my family over.  I'd be far more concerned that they love and treat my baby well.", "YTA. My parents were divorced as well. My kids called my stepdad papa. They loved having extra grandparents. My stepmom ended up being called sugar plum. She came into their lives a little later but adored them. If you have a good relationship I don\u2019t get the problem. All you\u2019re doing is leaving him out. It\u2019s a pretty petty issue.", "YTA for wanting to control your child on such a basic level. Let them decide once the kid is talking.", "Info \n\nDo you want the step parents to treat your child like a grandchild? Or do you just want them to be my spouses grandkid?", "Honestly, YTA. Based on this post and your comments- I don\u2019t think anybody was \u201cferal\u201d but you.", "Growing up, I had one grandfather (my other one passed away before I was born).  We called him Papa.  He was a huge part of my life until he passed away when I was 10.  When I had my first child, I was pretty big on having my kid call my father Papa, as it meant a lot to me.  Here's the difference.  I never once said that my father in law couldn't be Papa either.  And that's where we are at now.  I have a 7 year old son and a 4 year old daughter who call each grandfather Papa <last name to differentiate> and there is no confusion.\n\nIt literally costs you nothing to allow your kid to refer to your step father as Papa.  You're weaponizing the fact that you are the mother and to hell with all others.  YTA.\n\nAdditionally, my wife has an uncle Tony.  Our kids refer to him as Papa Tony.", "YTA.  I suppose it's your choice to be though.  Mostly I just don't understand it.  Your kid isn't going to pick the name they call their father.  You and he will when you talk to him as a baby, and they'll learn the name you use.  If the father wanted to be called \"papa\", that'd be different.  Also, if his own grandkids (bio or not) call him papa already, your kid may stand out or stand apart by not doing so (not to granddad, but to themself of the other kids).  I also think it's worth mentioning that though your intent may be to honor the bio-grandparents, what's more likely to happen is that you're only insulting the step-grandparents, even if they are too polite to say it.  Honestly, I think this is an extremely silly position to take.  Do what you'll do, but the fact you even care this much is puzzling.", "YTA. My grandkids have several sets of grandparents with step grandparents. The kids use a bunch of different names to refer to them. Even though you say you have a good relationship with this person you seem to want to punish him for some instated reason. Kids don't care about your feelings towards people who care for them. But you seem like you want to force your child to see them different. \n\nI mean, it's your kid but this seems silly and weirdly vindictive.", "YTA\n\nYour decision I guess, but it's a strange hill to die on.\n\nI had 3 sets of grandparents growing up, and everyone got a  different name.   Memaw/Pepaw, Grandma/Grandpaw, Grandmother/Pawpaw.  There are an endless number of names to assign step-grandparents.   You seem to be creating drama for drama's sake.\n\n\" My mother thinks that I\u2019m wrong because he\u2019s been there for me and we have a good relationship. ...if being there for me came with strings attached \"\n\nJFC, strings attached?  He wants a cutesy name for this grand  kid to call him.  You even admit to having a good relationship with him.  Well, you DID.  Not sure about now.   \n You're worse than most of the bad bride stories I read here, Drama llama.", "Seems like the weirdest fucking hill to die on. I mean it's just a fucking name and as soon as the kid can speak it's gonna be calling everyone what it wants anyway. How the fuck is a name so important that it's worth blowing up relationships for in these circumstances.... \n  \nYTA", "YTA.
