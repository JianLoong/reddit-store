About two brothers who fight demons and monsters. \n\nMy sister was a huge fan while the show was airing. Engaged in all areas of the fandom, like, insane super fan. I never really got into it like she did but was still involved in fandom spaces. \n\nAnyway, no beating around the bush, she was hugely into wincest (the romantic and sexual relationship between the two brothers). Wrote fic, edited youtube videos, etc. She even made like a wincest tumblr series with her ex girlfriend roleplaying as the two characters. \n\nSo you can imagine my shock when she gave birth to twins this past month and announced their names as Sam & Dean.\n\nI was a little taken aback but hoped somewhere that it was a joke. They have three older kids who also have fandom names (not supernatural necessarily, but across fandoms) and so I wasn't really holding up hope.\n\nI called her up and asked what the boys names really were and she informed me they were, in fact, called Sam & Dean.\n\nI told her it was really fucking weird and she told me it didn't matter because they weren't real and she didn't actually condone incest.\n\nI called her a freak and said it wasn't normal or fair to the boys. What if they found out, you know?\n\nShe told me I was overreacting and to either support her bringing the babied into the world or leave her alone.\n\nI left it at that & my mom later text me to ask what was going on. She knows my sister used to ship the brothers so I told her and she was quiet but ended up telling me that it wasn't the same and I needed to apologise because she was upset.\n\nI disagree. I think her choice was horrible and she deserves to feel shamed for it.\n\nSo, AITA? Am I actually in the wrong here? I know she's struggling right now, but still.\n\nETA; Additional information; They have a son called Severus and they seem to be encouraging \"snape\" behaviours in him (keeping his hair long, forcing him into like, chemistry summer camps and shit). Makes me feel like they're living vicariously through their kids or something.", "created_utc": 1685478484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w14wu/aita_for_calling_my_sister_a_freak_after_she/", "score": 4710, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sexually fantasized and most likely got off on the idea of two dudes named Sam and Dean, who are BROTHERS, fucking each other. Then she went and named her twin boys Sam and Dean.\n\nThat is fucking weird and disgusting. I would be horrified if I knew my mom named me after some guy she regularly masturbated to not to mention the incest connection. What. The. Fuck.\n\nEdit: And no, naming your kid after their father is not the same as naming them after \"someone you regularly masturbate to\" because a father is (obviously) so much more than that.", "Shocked by the general consensus here. NTA. She got sexual gratification from thinking about and depicting these brothers boning. Then she named her kids after them. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re normal names or that few people would put two and two together, it\u2019s nasty and a huge red flag that she named her kids after characters she wanted to see boning", "NTA. The problem isn\u2019t naming them after TV show characters, the problem is naming them after characters that she fantasized about being incestuous. Like whaaaaat? These aren\u2019t random names, these are names that they wrote very vulgar, gross fanfic about... even if it wasn\u2019t a real relationship in the show it was clearly real TO HER.\nIf you have to clarify \u201cI don\u2019t condone incest\u201d after naming your children you\u2019ve already fucked up. It\u2019s like naming your twins Cersei and Jamie\u2026 just why??", "OMG. NTA. \n\nIt wouldn't be bad if she didn't *literally create wincest fan content,* but she did. It's out there. The wayback machine has a copy of her old blog somewhere.  Those kids are going to find it one day, and they're going to be traumatized.", "I'm gonna go with NTA on this one. I too had an SPN phase and I was on the Y T A train from the title but the second i saw \"wincest,\" I saw where you're coming from. She's opening herself up to a lifetime of meeting fellow SPN fans who recognize her sons names, and then having to really tread carefully when she talks about her involvement in the fandom. I was never a wincest shipper but from the stuff I was exposed to in the fandom, I definitely understand why it makes you uncomfortable.", "The thing that gives me pause here is that there is a very strong chance her children will learn about her stories and videos.\n\nFor the record, most of the time people support these kinds of ships because they understand the actors playing the characters are not actually related. They are attracted to two people they know are not really related to each other and their minds ignore what they\u2019ve been told the relationship is meant to be in the show. It\u2019s very, very, different from supporting or encouraging real life taboos. \n\nIt\u2019s likely that her connection to those names have changed over time and that this is more about honoring a community that was welcoming and accepting. Friends and found family often come from fandoms and finding your people through ships. \n\nThat being said, I can\u2019t imagine the conversations that would need to happen once her children discover her fan fiction or her videos. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the names Sam and Dean. There\u2019s nothing wrong (within reason) with naming children after people or characters that had a huge impact on your life. There\u2019s nothing wrong with exploring sexuality or other concepts through healthy creative outlets like fan fiction.\n\nNaming your children after the characters you placed in sexual situations and having to explain that cognitive dissonance to them? That makes this NTA.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s really weird and creepy. I\u2019d be worried she would encourage incestuous behaviors in her children and I think you\u2019re right to call her out on it.", "I\u2019m going with NTA due to the fact that she was a wincest shipper, and it\u2019s really weird that she brought her children into it.\n\nIf she was a true spn fan she would have named her twins Sam and Castiel.", "Not giving judgement because logically they're perfectly fine, normal names and it's not like they're going to have problems later in life from it. But the second I saw that she was a \"wincest shipper\" I just... she named her children after characters she wants to see in an incestual sexual relationship. That's fucking *weird*.", "I was gonna vote against you until I got to the incest part. \n\nLuckily, the names are generic enough not to cause any harm. \n\nBut .... ewwwww.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nA lot of people are voting Y T A on the grounds of they are common names, but that is not what your post is about. I recognize you are mostly focusing on the type of fanfiction she wrote about the brothers and still named her sons after them. This is a bit alarming. I do think that you mother being taken back by this news, even if she didn't side with you, was quite informative. Obviously, you aren't gonna tell anyone, besides all of reddit, what your sister did. However, you know. You know and you can't unknow it. You will always know that your nephews are named after brothers from a tv show that their mother shipped together and enjoyed.", "(Note: given the above information but no definite ages, this comment assumes y'all are in my age bracket and your sister was a teenager when the show was airing)\n\nI mean, look. I don't think we should be naming our kids after fandom, because they are people and they deserve to discover their own interests.

I'd be really worried if I was you and it's entirely reasonable to tell her she's being creepy.", "WTAF did I just read?!", "NTA - I have issues reading romantic stories with characters who share names with my family members, I can\u2019t imagine naming my children after characters I write erotica about (Which I do).", "Initially I was going to say NTA. My husband and I are huge Supernatural fans. Didn't know those types of fan \"things\" existed. Only ever watched the show. After reading this information, it is weird and creepy because they are NOT brothers that sleep together. (please no judgement,  under innocent circumstances I'd have been Ok with the names).", "NTA, and I really do think anyone disagreeing just really isn't understanding what kind of porn we are talking about when we are talking about wincest fic.\n\n\nIt's really heinous to name your twin sons that after participating so zealously in the community and having written multiple eroticas about about brothers with these names. She did something gross/freaky, and you were grossed/freaked out. Big NTA.", "NTA. The line was crossed when she wrote incest fanfic about her kids\u2019 namesakes. That\u2019s gross and if anyone they go to school with finds it, those kids will be bullied to high heaven", "NTA.\n\nYou would be an a if she wasn't so weird about it - Sam and Dean are perfectly fine names, as a former SPN fan I would think it would be cool for someone to name their kids after them. But I also didn't ship them lol, nor would I try to force kids to fulfill some weird fanon thing.", "I think any time people criticize others for what they name their kids its a bit of an asshole move... but when they are not even weird or unusual names but pretty standard names, you are firmly in asshole territory", "Idk what you are but stay away from those kids if you\u2019re going to cause a scene about names. Maybe pick up a hobby or two. And the people supporting contacting CPS sound f**king insane", "INFO\n\nHow are you outraged by the names Sam and Dean, two completely normal and common names, and not fucking Severus?\n\nThe incest porn is a little weird, but there are much worse characters to be named after. I'm actually kinda disappointed she didn't name her other son Castiel.", "I can't possibly believe this is is not fake", "you gotta keep an eye  out like a hawk for those kids OP, be prepared to call CPS or authorities if things get weird at her house.\n\n make sure the kids know that they can come to you and you will listen and beleive them. NTA", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nHorrified at the amount of people that think otherwise. In what world is it okay to name your own twin children after a pair of fictional twins THAT YOU ACTIVELY IMAGINE HAVING SEX TOGETHER??? WAY too many people are glossing over the incest. If I was one of the boys and I found out years down the line the story behind my name was that I would feel violated. \n\nImo, no one who has incestuous thoughts or inclinations should have children, or at THE VERY LEAST NOT NAME THEM AFTER SUCH INCLINATIONS. Ew. I feel disgusted reading all the y t a comments.", "NTA. Naming your kids after fandom only ends in bullying once it\u2019s figured out. I named my kid a name that is shared by a superhero, but it wasn\u2019t intentional and he still got shit.", "NTA she named kids after the siblings that she read incestuous smut about, that's really really weird", "I'm literally watching Supernatural right now. NTA, that's creepy and weird", "NTA - I\u2019d be worried about the kids as they grow into young men. Just fing weird thing to do", "NTA, if they're encouraging their other child to do things the character he's based off from does, I'd be worried too. They should not have children if they're going to project others personalities and behaviors on them. Like some kind of ascended role playing.", "Your sister has issues. If she was just a fan I'd be voting against you, but NTA in this case", "Amazed at all the Y T A, she wants to name her twin sons after characters she shipped together, wrote about fanfics etc this seems really, really odd to me especially the mention of the Severus thing NTA", "YTA\n\nThe only one spreading this info is you. The only one bothered by this is you. They\u2019re not your children and the names are fine.", "I liked SUeprnatural, and Sam and Dean are cool brother names.\n\nThe Wincest fanfiction, though. That is a tad odd.\n\nThe ETA does not help.\n\nNTA", "Forget the names, perfectly normal names. The reasoning why she chose those names is fucking weird as hell and I could see why OP would call her out on it. Ill say it again, that is WEIRD.", "YTA - two good names.  who cares the reasons why.  At least it's not like Starpower and Flutterby.", "YTA. I never watched the show, but what she named her kids is really no one else's business", "Ya okay it\u2019s weird but it\u2019s weirder to think she\u2019s shipping her newborn twins. Come on now. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, they are common normal names, and clearly your sister isn't going to ship her two twin sons together, she just likes the names", "YTA.  First of all, not your business.  Also, those are perfectly normal names to give children.  And, although Supernatural was a really popular show, those names are normal enough that most people may not immediately make the jump to that show.  I know I wouldn't have.  You were very rude to your sister.  Apologize.", "ESH. I do think it's VERY weird to name her children that after her shipping those two characters but at the end of the day they are her children and not yours. Stay out of her business", "YTA - Is this fan fiction vs reality really the hill you want to die on?", "YTA. Literally named my child after a villian in Star Trek.

I think you should just leave it alone though.", "I loved Supernatural and I wanted to name my son Dean. But the whole incest fanfic is really disturbing. It would be one thing if she was just a superfan of the show and loved the winchester brothers but it\u2019s a whole different situation all together that she wrote incest fanfic of them then named her kids after them. I think it\u2019s weird. NTA", "YTA. It's not like she named them Metatron and Abaddon. They still have normal names.", "NTA. Your poor nephews and nieces.", "NTA, I think if she hadn't been a shipper, it would have been okay. I mean, they're literally brothers in the show. But knowing that she was active in the ship? That's gross", "YTA. I get why people are freaking out. But going from she was into incest porn to even suggest that she would ever force her children into incest is a HUGE leap. She Was teenage when she wrote it, teens do weird shit. Plus fantasy is not reality. And honestly naming the kids Sam and Dean could be paying homage to the show, not the fan fiction. There are too many unknowns. Only she knows why she wants to name them that. Either way they are her children, not yours.", "YTA\n\nSam and Dean are pretty normal names in terms of fandom names.\n\nSo rather than congratulate the birth of your nephews you belittle a hormonal postpartum mother in naming her children normal names?", "Lucifer and Castiel are strange to name kids, Sam and Dean not so much.", "light  YTA\n\nMan, I agree with you, why are you naming your sons after two characters you used to incestuously ship?\n\nLike that's weird.\n\nBut then again your sister was just a stupid teenager who probably just dealt with her with her sexual awakening in a weird way. But as many people do, she grew up, and although her wincest era ended, she still appreciates the characters.\n\nShe may have though the whole incest thing was a big joke, or in actuality just shipped the actors.\n\nI get getting weird about it but then again there's nothing to achieve. In this case, it was better to be silent", "YTA \n\nCalm down. Those are normal names and she can name her kids what she wants to. She does not deserve to feel shame ffs", "lol YTA.", "YTA, most people don't know those names come from a tv series. Your sister has grown up, what she thoughed as teen isn't the same she does now", "YTA I went through a terrible supernatural phase as well and if you can believe it, I don't sexualize every person I meet named Sam or Dean, nor do I sexualize them with each other. \n\nIt is in fact possible to separate these fictional people in this fictional story and these names existing together in reference to the show. Like, tbh, I think it's a lot weirder that you're so upset about this than the fact that she named her kids that. Like, do you think she's going to ship her twin together? Try to get them to fuck? Is there any actual reason for.you to think that? Because I just don't understand what your actual problem is if it's not that.", "YTA. Are you planning on reading wincest fanfic to the babies as a bedtime story? \n\nWe all have cringe phases when we're young, that doesn't mean we're going to sit there and indoctrinate our kids into every cringe thing we did.\n\nIt's two fairly normal names, what's the problem?", "INFO What if they found out?

I have nephews named Bo and Luke because their parents liked The Dukes of Hazzard a lot. \n\nNow that\u2019s something that you just gotta role your eyes at if it bothers you, but your sister is something else.

Geez, they're not Gandalf and Hodor!  Get over yourself OP!", "YTA. Their names are none of your business.

When the kids are adults it\u2019s not going to be noticeable.", "This is a hard one. On one hand, you're right - that is weird knowing the context, and if I knew this in real life I would feel disgusted by them. The names themselves are not the problem, I agree with other comments. The only thing that makes this weird is knowing she was/is super into an incest fan ship, *into it enough to manage a blog about it* . \n\nBut, you probably didn't need to call her a freak and hurt her feelings.

About two brothers who fight demons and monsters. \n\nMy sister was a huge fan while the show was airing. Engaged in all areas of the fandom, like, insane super fan. I never really got into it like she did but was still involved in fandom spaces. \n\nAnyway, no beating around the bush, she was hugely into wincest (the romantic and sexual relationship between the two brothers). Wrote fic, edited youtube videos, etc. She even made like a wincest tumblr series with her ex girlfriend roleplaying as the two characters. \n\nSo you can imagine my shock when she gave birth to twins this past month and announced their names as Sam & Dean.\n\nI was a little taken aback but hoped somewhere that it was a joke. They have three older kids who also have fandom names (not supernatural necessarily, but across fandoms) and so I wasn't really holding up hope.\n\nI called her up and asked what the boys names really were and she informed me they were, in fact, called Sam & Dean.\n\nI told her it was really fucking weird and she told me it didn't matter because they weren't real and she didn't actually condone incest.\n\nI called her a freak and said it wasn't normal or fair to the boys. What if they found out, you know?\n\nShe told me I was overreacting and to either support her bringing the babied into the world or leave her alone.\n\nI left it at that & my mom later text me to ask what was going on. She knows my sister used to ship the brothers so I told her and she was quiet but ended up telling me that it wasn't the same and I needed to apologise because she was upset.\n\nI disagree. I think her choice was horrible and she deserves to feel shamed for it.\n\nSo, AITA? Am I actually in the wrong here? I know she's struggling right now, but still.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fandom names are kinda cringe imo but they ain't your kids or problem.  Best you can do is keep an eye out for any weirdness and encourage your nephews to view you as a safe person to confide in.  Be a good uncle and hopefully you can chalk this up to your sister being weird and thats all that happens.", "Me:  What's the problem those are cute names...continues reading...okay a little weird but ...reads a bit more... DEAR LORD NO! WHY?! UGH!  NTA! NTA!", "also can i just add, they will 100 percent find out about this, fandoms don't die especially shows like supernatural and i guarantee in 14/15 years if they ever start reading fanfic or one of their friends reads fanfic they will find out about people shipping sam and dean, they will ask their family ie their mum or their dad or op and their parents will lie to them probably, op however should definitely tell them if they ask, sorry might be controversial but their parents made that decision they can uphold it if they're ever questioned on it", "As a fan of the show, wow. Just wow. I'm well aware of what the fandom is like and what wincest is but I never thought that someone would go and do this. This is beyond sick. This is abuse.", "Going to say NTA, purely because even the actors who played sam and dean called out this wierd fan behaviour.\n\nHOWEVER, most people would not think of incest. Because that was not even part of the show. It was random cult behaviour from a small group of people. Thankfully only you will know about your sister, and likely she has grown out of it. When this shipping happened it was what? 2012? 11 years ago. She\u2019s likely moved out of the weird phase but still likes the show.\n\nFor the sake of your nephews keep this to yourself because they have to live with the names now. My aunt named my cousin after a rockstar she was OBSESSED WITH and groupied, not as bad as fangirling incest but its not like the shows characters actually did anything bad, that was just your sister. \n\nKeep an eye on this kids, your sister has huge red flags and just look for signs of child mistreatment because she may be unhinged.", "I was ready to call you the Ahole until I read it all and realized you sister is in FACT A FREAK AND YOURE JUSTIFIED!!!!

Usually OC/character ships, but I would NOT name my kid after someone that I\u2019ve lusted over. It just feels wrong. If it was a respect thing, totally get it; or if they just like the name in general. But people who they\u2019ve literally had sexual fantasies about (especially with the included wincest), crosses the line I\u2019m drawing here in the sand. And I saw the edit too that they kind of push their kids towards certain traits and personalities, like with the kid they named Severus. Something definitely is wrong there. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.", "NTA. Ick", "NTA. I feel gross just from reading this. Like she can't seriously think naming her kids after characters that she rubbed off too committing incest is okay right? Like wtf.....", "NTA.

I would get calling your avatar or a pet like that but a kid? Eww no. And what are they doing with Severus is just horrible. Plus Severus is really an only HP name.\n\nYeah Sam and Dean are common name for English speaking countries, but most people nowadays would think at supernatural, it was a huge tv shows. More or less if she call twins Fred and George, well at least there wouldn\u2019t be incest game.", "NTA, I was on the YTA train since I have friends who are also massive Supernatural fans who have 2 daughters: Samantha and Deanna .....  BUUUUTTT ...... then you said wincest and certain behavior encouragement with Severus. \n\nYour sister definitely named her kids after her kinks, and it's beyond creepy. \nNot shaming her kinks, everyone has the right to fly that freak flag, but don't turn your kid into the flag you have been flying.\n\nThere might be a gentlier way to explain to her why it's wrong? Telling her she should be ashamed is never going to make her understand. Maybe use another fandom as an example?", "What in the Jocasta complex? NTA. Absolutely NTA.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the names are common or people might not immediately put it together. She\u2019s naming her two *children* after an *incest ship* that she *actively shipped*. This is the kind of thing that would make Freud rise from the grave.", "NTA, doubly so after your edits.", "At least Sam & Dean are normal names? You really buried the lede with \"Severus,\" lmfao. To me that's a bigger issue than the kids who at least have names that won't cause a laugh riot at the HR department. Good god people, adopt a cat or dog if you wanna name someone something outrageous. \n\nThis one is tough. I'm gonna have to go with ESH, because you're not entirely wrong, but calling your sister a \"freak\" is probably too far. It's not going to make her change their names or stop the... Snapeification? of her other son, it's only going to drive you out of their lives and these kids are gonna need family who don't have their head so far up their ass as their mom.", "NTA\nI love Supernatural but would never name a kid after the characters.

I've definitely fantasized about being with either of them (but never shipped them, incest is gross!). For this reason *alone* I wouldn't name my kids either name (unless maybe a middle name) because anytime I said their name, I'd be reminded that I had all kinds of dirty sex with a character with that name, in my mind.

Not only will all the kids know their parents decided to name them after two tv show characters and possibly get bullied. They\u2019ll probably find out about this down the line and hate their names if they won\u2019t already.", "NTA. The background of Wincest is just weird and creepy, and imo kind of negates that they are normal names on their own. \nThe Severus one\u2026.it\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to ensure her kids are bullied.", "YTA. They aren't ridiculous names and liking a TV show and naming your kids after characters is not wild.  \n\n\nYour reaction is wild though and you should be ashamed by your behavior.", "As a Supernatural (ex-ish)fan, your sister is one of those nutjob fans who doesn't live in the real world.

Reading is stage one, writing is stage two, and role playing is stage three of being into something (yes, there are other things/stages, but those aren't being addressed).\n\nIt's weird.

Children aren\u2019t toys, you don\u2019t get to mold their identities around your obsessions. It never ends well and it\u2019s a recipe for resentment. It\u2019s one thing to introduce your kid to the things you like and hope they develop an interest in them too, but this isn\u2019t that. This is on a level that is\u2026 unhealthy and creepy.

Lol.\n\nI'm a huge supernatural fan. I'm a dean girl. But I find the wincest thing gross and the destiel shippers delusional. If it wasn't for the fanfic part, I would think it was cute. But yeah, it's icky. \n\nNTA", "Yes haha", "Yeah, I just don't want to pass judgement here either. Like, on one very obvious hand, ew. \n\nOn the other, maybe, maybe there's a slim hope that it was just a hormonal teenage phase that she regrets. It's perfectly possible for a 13 year old to get swept away by an alluring, seemingly mature online community, and obsess over it for a couple months, but then realize how cringy it is and distance herself from it. That's especially true when the community in question is a cultish one that seemingly normalizes something inappropriate and taboo- kids are super susceptible to developing warped mindsets before they become more worldly. \n\nIt's totally possible that Supernatural had a positive impact on her life and social circles outside the \"winscest\" stuff, which was only a brief fling (pun intended) during her entire relationship with the series as a fan. Maybe she only briefly associated with those shippers before moving on, but OP magnified it to be something more than it is. I mean, I really hope so. \n\nNow, if she kept that wincest blog throughout all of high school and college and made it part of her identity, I'd steer a bit more heavily into N T A, but I really have trouble passing strong judgment against children who probably didn't know better, especially when they've had decades to change.", "Thank you.

At least Sam and Dean are themselves regular names, but Severus is just so odd and so obviously Harry Potter. The incest thing makes Sam and Dean worse names though.", "Yeah, tbh, I think that Sam and Dean as brother names, even with the fandom stuff, is fine. If I met them I'd be like 'oh parents were probably fans of the show, whatever, they're still normal names.' But it's the shipping that tips it over the line.", "I have a fandom middle name. Not particularly into the show, but it's a cool story and the name itself is pretty unique. Now, if I found out my parents had a crooked history involving the character, I might feel a little bit differently. Like, nothing *really* wrong with incest kinkfic, not at all my cup of tea but I don't shame. It's a fantasy, it's not real, it can't hurt anyone\u2014until you start trying to grow your own characters IRL. This women's story is disturbing and goes against every principle of ethical fandom practices I've ever encountered.", "My cat Castiel shakes his head at you.", "Yeah, I named my puppy Dean because I was really into the Fandom, at the time, and very team Dean, not Sam. So when I got my chorkiy puppy, super tiny smaller than my hand tiny but full of bark and attitude, it just fit so well. My sister got one too but named him Zero after the ghost dog in the nightmare before Christmas. My Dean is mostly just called Deano now and he lost his name tag so my grandpa put the one from my old cat on him so if he did ever get lost and found people would think his name is Mittens. All that being said, I would not name my human child after a fictional character I like. I do not like anything about the whole 'winsest' thing but I would absolutely not do that to kids because I know it is a thing, so just to be safe and kind and save them from some future horror I would never do that to my children.", "Just google tumblr snape wives and have your mind blown. There are several YouTube videos about it. \n\nThink of it like a tumblr versions of waifus", "That\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019ve only seen scooby doo mystery incorporated because of Jello Apocalypse recommending it but even he admits chunks of it are terrible!  Still need to find the spn/doo crossover since it\u2019s not on Netflix for some reason. \n\nI really haven\u2019t even bothered with new star wars, but everyday I like the prequels more and more so idk where that puts me in the rankings of bad star wars fans.", "The names are fine.

It's facts.", "Khaleesi has entered the chat", "[deleted]", "When I was a teen (like young teen, 13-14 tops), I loved the idea of naming my kids after my favorite video game or book characters.

(I kid) Thank you for clarifying that for me!!", "Destiel, how dare you! \ud83d\ude02 But also, you wanna stop and ponder why gay ships are more prevalent?

Sam and Dean loved each other (not in *that* way though), cared about people deeply, and tried to make the world a better place. Not the worst characters to name kids after. This person just made it super creepy though", "Omg that\u2019s such a great cat name", "\\*shudder\\* at twins references.....", "This was my first thought as well, there is a lot of overlap in Wincest and twincest communities especially as we\u2019ve established she\u2019s a Harry Potter fan.

Ugh.", "Hermoine at least was a real name before the Harry Potter series, but apparently rowling chose it specifically because it was a very uncommon name. So at this point it's basically exclusively associated with the series", "See, Hermione was a regular -if not uncommon- name before Harry Potter. It was originally an Ancient Greek name, then Shakespeare chose it for the name of one of his characters, which popularised it back then. Of course, most of the Hermiones born now are likely to be named after the Harry Potter character", "My dad went to high school with a brother and sister named Luke and Leah. They were both born before Star Wars, and they graduated in 1979 so people in school teased them because in *Star Wars* Luke and Leia are obviously set up as a romantic couple. I'm sure they felt very validated in 1983.", "I feel especially bad for the Khaleesi/Daenerys kids because she was nuts from the beginning but apparently lots of people didn't notice that part for some reason?", "So I did name my child after a very original character name but it has a very standard abbreviation and I gave him, his grandparents  first name on both sides  (coincidentally) middle name, so if he didn't like the name he could easily go by something more standard. I named my dog khaleesi as she had a knack for breaking out of kennels as a pup.", "Othello, that you?

There may be more where it's mentioned in passing.", "I just love that you're calling me a kid when I'm in my thirties!

Definitely a fun history to look up!", "On an even more basic level, Bellatrix is a cool name.", "Admiring the actress would be fairly normal, idolizing the actress to the point of pedestal status a little weird yet mostly harmless, but entirely conflating an actress with a character she played to be increasingly deranged and violent? Absolutely does not bode well for OPs sisters ability to differentiate reality from fiction. \n\nThere'd be plenty of reasons to have adored HBC as a teenage girl, but to place the adoration for HBC's redeeming qualities as a real person onto the fictional Bellatrix, who was an ostensibly terrible archetype of a sadistic, emotionally unstable, race-purist in that fictional universe... Just really reinforces that there's some blurring between fiction and reality that would make naming your kids after an incestuous ship you roleplayed in even more disconcerting than it already ist", "I'm autistic and also get that feeling from the description. It doesn't help that it looks like the family enables her; I think this blew up because OP was the first to call her out in a long time.", "It's hard for me to say because I don't want kids, but I'm autistic and can definitely relate to the rest about using fandom to cope. I honestly don't see a problem with any of that except for bringing real human children into it.

Can't imagine how massively it's going to blow up in mom's face as that Severus kid gets older. What happens when he doesn't have an acuity or liking for chemistry, etc? Will she be super disappointed? Probably. Will the kid know it? Definitely. The stage was already set for resentment on both sides as soon as that kid was born. The whole incest brother's thing? They WILL find out. So, unlike Severus's resentment which will unfold over time, the twins' will unfold over a matter of seconds.
