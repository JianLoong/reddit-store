Let him deal with him mother's glitter bombs.", "Yes, YWBTA, but I have a potentially better solution for you. Open the gifts outdoors over a garbage can and extract the money. For every glitter package she sends, use the money to offset the cost of sending her a glitter bomb of your own. Let the kid who got glitter money help pick out the color or something if it's an option.  Places like ruin days dot com also allow you to send them anonymously.

It could be harrassment. It could also be a distant grandmother wanting to send \"fun and memorable surprises\" to her inter-state grandkids.\n\nYou can return the mail unopened if you want, but that will give her a hell of a story to tell where you might not look great. Only you can decide how much that matters in the long run and how worth it it is. Alternatively, you could contact her to explain the boundary and that you and the boys don't enjoy the glitter (and the mess), they'd prefer a card and if she wants to include a bit of 'magic treat' gift, stickers would be much more appreciated. Open the next letter over the bin, and if she's ignored you, that's the last one.\n\nThe judgement here depends on what your ex-MIL's intentions are, it could be N-A-H but I'm leaning towards NTA", "So\u2026I do not think you would be the jerk but\u2026\n\nINFO\n\nEven with the confetti, and the booby traps of twisting the money, that was already a super passive aggressive thing to do on your MILs part.
