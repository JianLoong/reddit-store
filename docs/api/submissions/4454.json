My parents split when I was 4. My dad is currently singe but my mom met her new boyfriend when I was around 10 we\u2019ll call him John. John has two kids from a previous relationship. They were 6 and 7 when I met them. We\u2019ll call them Sophie(20) and Mike(21). \n\nI have a good relationship with John, he\u2019s never tried to force the father role and I regard him as my moms boyfriend, not my stepfather. However through the years he\u2019s automatically joined in for some important moments in my life, and when strangers accidentally refer to him as my father I don\u2019t correct them. They do not live together but he stayed over a lot while I was living at home. I am however not close with his children, and don\u2019t regard them as family, nor even people I particularly like. Both step siblings had major behavioral issues growing up, that resulted in me not wanting to be around them. Both my mom and her boyfriend respected this, and I\u2019ve never spend much time around them. \n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I have sent our wedding invitations, and I have chosen not to invite my step siblings. John is invited as my moms partner, and he doesn\u2019t hold any parental role in the wedding. My mom fully understands and respect why I haven\u2019t invited Sophie and Mike. However my mom told me John is a bit disappointed I haven\u2019t invited his children. Sophie and Mike however are furious. I\u2019ve gotten multiple texts from them, saying I\u2019m a shitty person for not inviting them, and as their step-big sister, they have a right to be there on my wedding day. \n\nI do not want them around, our wedding is gonna be intimate and we only want people around us we truly enjoy spending time with. I didn\u2019t enjoy spending time with my step siblings when I was a child, and they have grown up to be people I don\u2019t want to be around. Sophie cannot stand not being the center of attention, she cannot sit still and she\u2019s the type to complain about everything. I\u2019ve never really had much connection with Mike, but he\u2019s also got some anger issues and he\u2019s extremely arrogant. Sophie and Mike also doesn\u2019t interact with anyone but themselves and their father, and their interactions usually always end in some form of conflict. They also do not know anyone else at the wedding. \n\nI can understand why it would be expected I invite my step siblings, but I do not have a relationship to these people, and if I do it\u2019s a negative one. However the backlash we\u2019re getting for excluding them seems a bit extreme. I had no idea they\u2019d expect to even be invited.
