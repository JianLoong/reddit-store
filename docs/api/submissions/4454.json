My parents split when I was 4. My dad is currently singe but my mom met her new boyfriend when I was around 10 we\u2019ll call him John. John has two kids from a previous relationship. They were 6 and 7 when I met them. We\u2019ll call them Sophie(20) and Mike(21). \n\nI have a good relationship with John, he\u2019s never tried to force the father role and I regard him as my moms boyfriend, not my stepfather. However through the years he\u2019s automatically joined in for some important moments in my life, and when strangers accidentally refer to him as my father I don\u2019t correct them. They do not live together but he stayed over a lot while I was living at home. I am however not close with his children, and don\u2019t regard them as family, nor even people I particularly like. Both step siblings had major behavioral issues growing up, that resulted in me not wanting to be around them. Both my mom and her boyfriend respected this, and I\u2019ve never spend much time around them. \n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I have sent our wedding invitations, and I have chosen not to invite my step siblings. John is invited as my moms partner, and he doesn\u2019t hold any parental role in the wedding. My mom fully understands and respect why I haven\u2019t invited Sophie and Mike. However my mom told me John is a bit disappointed I haven\u2019t invited his children. Sophie and Mike however are furious. I\u2019ve gotten multiple texts from them, saying I\u2019m a shitty person for not inviting them, and as their step-big sister, they have a right to be there on my wedding day. \n\nI do not want them around, our wedding is gonna be intimate and we only want people around us we truly enjoy spending time with. I didn\u2019t enjoy spending time with my step siblings when I was a child, and they have grown up to be people I don\u2019t want to be around. Sophie cannot stand not being the center of attention, she cannot sit still and she\u2019s the type to complain about everything. I\u2019ve never really had much connection with Mike, but he\u2019s also got some anger issues and he\u2019s extremely arrogant. Sophie and Mike also doesn\u2019t interact with anyone but themselves and their father, and their interactions usually always end in some form of conflict. They also do not know anyone else at the wedding. \n\nI can understand why it would be expected I invite my step siblings, but I do not have a relationship to these people, and if I do it\u2019s a negative one. However the backlash we\u2019re getting for excluding them seems a bit extreme. I had no idea they\u2019d expect to even be invited.

It's your wedding and they only want to be there because they feel entitled to be, not because they care about you and your fianc\u00e9.

A genuine relationship hasn't been built here, so why should you invite them? \n\nI wish I would go back and uninvite my bullying sibling. He was really late which was hugely disruptive, and then basically left his kids with me to look after during the reception. He then got on social media afterward and complained about what an awful person I was. \n\nMy point being, people who are all drama about stuff like this will probably never be happy and you can honestly do without that bullshit on your big day.", "It's your wedding so invite who you want. If you have an 'evening do' after the main wedding event where more guests come then perhaps give them an invitation to that", "You're NTA. It's time to block thise two.

Also no one, regardless of their relationship with you has a right to attend your wedding, that statement alone is enough of a clue as to how toxic and narcissistic she is in life.  The other one is just a rage machine that needs about 10 years of therapy to become a decent person.   Even money says they will ruin your wedding if invited and I would go as far as to say they may crash it given their attitudes.   Be prepared.", "NTA you could remind them that because your mom and their that is \u2018just\u2019 dating they are technically Nothing to you.", "NTA. your wedding your rules. they can be as mad as they want but that will only make things worse. good luck on your wedding", "NTA - you\u2019re choosing not to reward bad behavior on your dime. \n\nAnd technically, they\u2019re not your step siblings.

Ill have to figure out what we do if they do show up", "We\u2019ve invited 46 people.", "And even without that part it still is YOUR wedding. Only invite people you want to. Them going on a rampage when they hear they are not invited is how greatly they see you. They are really shitty stepsiblings and maybe even a bit shitty people because acting like that is never okay.", "Because even if you don't particularly care for them, they are his children and he's been with your mom a very long time and they are his family and he probably feels a bit insulted. Again it's your wedding and you're NTA but don't be surprised if this damages your relationship with him forever.", "They just want something to complain about, why wait to cause drama at the event when they can cause drama now and have you focus on them? Sounds like their usual MO.\n\nDon't let them take up anymore headspace.", "Sounds like a lovely, intimate group and it makes sense you only want people you are legitimately close to there."]}
