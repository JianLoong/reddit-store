I\u2019m a 24(F) and my fianc\u00e9 who is 24(M) is getting married in October of this year. We got engaged last December of 2022. My sister and I are not close. We have a 3 year age difference (27(F))and this would be her second marriage. Her and her fianc\u00e9 30(M) got engaged this January. We were obviously happy for one another as we as a family are close and our Fianc\u00e9s are friends. (as i stated before me and my sister aren\u2019t close and do not get along) Me and and My fianc\u00e9 wanted to get married in October because we want a fall themed wedding and by then we would have enough money to pay for it. We planned this date in October (which happens to be the same day as my parents anniversary) a week after we got engaged. We revealed the date to my family and they agreed that sounds good. (family in town, getting to share my special day with my parents, getting work off etc.) My sister got really excited when she heard the idea of a autumn wedding. So just to help her out for a date i said maybe November or early December. All of a sudden during wedding planning she began to sob in front of me and my mother because she really wanted to have the same date of the wedding as mine because it\u2019s the same day our parents got married. (She\u2019s never expressed that she wanted this date. ever.) My mom tends to baby my sister because she\u2019s been through a lot, so my mom sympathized with her. I was honestly shocked at this because she\u2019s never explained that she wanted the same date but i understood why she would want it.  My mom later in private asked me to change my wedding date for my sister. I was upset and told her no because that date already had a sentimental value to me and we planned it before her. My mom went crazy on me and started calling me selfish. I called my dad about it and my dad got super upset at my mom for even asking. My fianc\u00e9 and my sisters fianc\u00e9 are both really mad at my sister too for asking. especially since she never even tried to discuss it with her fianc\u00e9. My mom is now extremely upset with me about it for telling my dad. I honestly don\u2019t know that to think of this and besides my dad, my fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9 my entire family is calling me a selfish baby who can\u2019t be happy for her sister.

Your sister can have the date, not in 2023 but in 2024.  You will have the same anniversary but in my book that is okay.  I do not know how you feel it about it.

She says \"whole family,\" but I don't know who else will be invited to both.

If sister wants to get married in October and hasn't booked anything, there will be very very few options. Actual details will help OP, if the sister hasn't booked anything, doesn't have a location, hotel block, timing.\n\n\nAnd, it's quite possible there are people OP is inviting that the sister only kind of knows that she'd invite just to mess with OP."]}
