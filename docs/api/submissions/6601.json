Not my cup of tea, but it\u2019s your wedding. You should deserve to spend the day the way you wanted. However, I may have given my mom a heads up. I\u2019m surprised the subject of who would officiate your wedding didn\u2019t come up sooner.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding (and your money), your choices. You should do it the way you geel comfortable. It is not your mother's wedding. There is nothing wrong with not going fully traditional. She should not expect that everyone has her taste.", "as long as the bride and groom are happy no one elses options matters. NTA", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m laughing my ass off over here, but I think giving your mom a heads up would have been good so she didn\u2019t have to come to terms with it in the moment.", "NTA.  This is absolutely hilarious!  A sense of humor is awesome in a marriage.   I don't think it's a mockery as you both agreed it's what you wanted and paid for.  Not gonna lie but would have loved to have gone to a wedding like this!  If you ever renew your vows please have Elvis officiate lol!", "NTA, your wedding, your choice. I just find it so ridiculous how so many people feel so confident in forcing their views and opinions on others' weddings. It is literally meant to be you and your partner's day. Only your opinion matters.", "NTA\n\nYou mother had no say in the planning of your wedding.  Maybe she'll get over it, maybe she won't.  Don't make it your problem.\n\nHappy Wedding", "NTA. It was your ceremony, not your mothers. My husband and I dressed up as Morticia and Gomez on Halloween. Uncle Fester officiated.", "NTA be glad you didnt inherit your mom's sense of humor", "NTA. Your mother seems to be forgetting that this is YOUR day, YOUR event. She doesn't get a say in how it goes down. If it doesn't align with how *she* thinks a wedding should go, that's *her* problem.  You didn't cause her to feel any certain way, that's her own doing. \n\n\nI'm sorry your mom couldn't just be happy for you and enjoy the moment. I hope you didn't/don't let it ruin what should be a very happy time for you and your spouse.  My sister had to deal with in laws that didn't like how they chose to get married (backyard ceremony with just parents/siblings, no reception) and to this day, nearly 10 years later, her in laws complain about it. My sister says her only regret is including them at all since all they've done is complain.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you get to make the decisions for what you want it to be. Considering the fact that my fiance and I are looking to have our officiant dress up as Pinhead from Hellraiser, a clown is pretty tame.", "NTA. Kudos for creativity. I like the idea. It\u2019s not her wedding. Not you families wedding. Not their problem. If they paid, they\u2019d have a say. Simple as that.", "NTA. Your wedding, your money, do what you want. \n\nCan we see a wedding pic? :o)", "Clearly your mom lacks a sense of humor because a wedding is no joke, even with a clown officiant.\n\nCongrats on the nuptials.\n\nNTA", "NTA You and your partner had the wedding y'all wanted and that's all that matters", "LOL, NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding. As long as you and your spouse agreed, hilarious \ud83d\ude02", "Nta. If I wasn't terrified of clowns I would do this just to mess with people at my wedding.", "NTA and congratulations on your wedding. \n\nTo each their own. If having the clown officiate made both you and your wife happy that\u2019s what matters. \nThe choices of your parents are just that, theirs. You and your wife have started this chapter of your lives the way you wanted.", "That sounds funny, NTA. Traditional mom's don't understand this kind of stuff, but if you were happy doing it this way then that's the only thing that really matters", "NTA- please share a pic! Also did anyone get nightmares from the clown??", "NTA, at least you didn't try to make all your guests bring their own puppet", "NTA. It's your marriage, you decide what happens at it.

We thought it would be perfectly in taste with the senses of humour of our guests and by scanning the crowd our friends definitely enjoyed it.\n\nI don't know your sense of humor, but that's excellent. You and your wife got married the way you wanted to get married. What more could anyone possibly want from a wedding?\n\n>It was only after the ceremony that my mother pulled me aside nearly in tears\n\nSurely the ceremony was a success, then? Parents are supposed to get a little weepy when one of their children gets married.\n\n>She asked me how I could make my most important day into a joke\n\nYou wrote that the day was incredible. You certainly didn't consider it a joke. It's sad that she thinks your wedding was a joke, and very disrespectful of her too.\n\n>how could I humiliate her and my family by doing this\n\nYou didn't humiliate her, she chose to humiliate herself by throwing a tantrum.\n\n>I tried to reason that we had funded the wedding ourselves and we were taking it as seriously as anyone else.\n\nShe's probably a bit annoyed that your wife and you funded the wedding yourselves, because if she had funded it then she'd almost certainly have felt entitled to control it and threatened to withhold funds had you still opted for a clown to officiate it. Like I wrote above, she's a control freak, and she's freaking out because she didn't get to control your wedding.\n\n>She claims I\u2019ve made a mockery of our marriage and that she is tremendously disappointed in me.\n\nIf I were you then I'd be disappointed in her for not being able to be happy for her child's wedding day.\n\n>I feel bad that I\u2019ve caused her to feel this way but I still feel that we were justified in organizing our marriage how we saw fit.\n\nDon't feel bad and definitely don't apologize for organizing your wedding day the way you wanted to. Your mom can either grow up and be happy for you or continue crying like a petulant child.", "NTA and I fucking love that. Your mom is completely out of line trying to say you shamed your family and disgraced your marriage. If anything she did by going off on you. You chose how you wanted your life with your new wife to start and it was with laughter and fun. Keep it up man and you\u2019re marriage will hopefully last decades to come! Also congratulations!!", "NTA, it's not your mum's wedding!", "Not sure on this one tbh, I'd agree with the below people saying that it's your wives and yourselves day and should commence it however you want.. but your mom has a point...\n\nIt's your supposed \"most important day of your life\", why would you make a mockery of that?\n\nI'm sure you could've made your guests laugh in a different way. \nI also personally find clowns quite scary (and I know many others do too) so why pick such a caricature for a moment of beauty?\n\nIf you want to be so different there are many ways to achieve this rather than hiring and actual clown.. it sounds a bit immature and college level humor to me.\nI think most people in the room mainly thought \"wtf\"?\n\nI sure as hell would've...\nI most likely would've burst out in laughter too out of how ridiculous it is.", "Yta  - yes it's true it's your wedding. But out of respect you should've informed your parents. \n\nThe fact that you didn't makes me think that you knew their reaction would be negative. \nInstead of being an adult and letting them know, you hid it.\n\nWeddings are full of traditions, ceremony and religion. You don't have to follow any of them. However it is respectful to inform loved ones of major deviations. \n\nYou have every right to use a clown but you should've informed them. You knew your parents were going to react negatively. \n\nYta - for the lack of respect.", "Nothing wrong with hiring a clown per se, but your story seems suspicious.   \nYou claim you didn't think anyone would care, but your Mom was obviously very offended.    \nIf you were actually clueless and just don't know your mom that well, I'd say NTA.    \nIf you were actually doing it as a passive aggressive slight to your family I'd say YTA.", "NTA. You know it. It was your wedding.  You can plan it how you want it. It\u2019s Your choice. You paid for it. It\u2019s a no brainer that you are not the AH. \n\nYour mother is out of line and inappropriate to be upset. It\u2019s not about her or her family reputation. It is not, no matter what she thinks, a reflection on anyone but you  and your spouse. \n\nI thought it was a fun and light hearted way to celebrate and officiate a marriage. Kudos for the originality. \n\nAlso for moral support, I was married almost 25 years by a woman ordained Methodist minister. Almost unheard of in the late 90\u2019s. I received a lot of backlash from older women and religious types at my wedding who found it difficult to accept. Because according to them my marriage was not sanctified by God if I was married by a woman, as it\u2019s a man\u2019s role to be the priest, not the woman\u2019s.  I\u2019m not even going to argue that point now. However, at the end of the day we are married, like you and your spouse are. We, like you, enjoyed our day and would not change a thing. And that\u2019s the only two people who\u2019s opinion matter! \n\nCongratulations on your nuptials.", "NTA.\n\nHow does it humiliate *her* or the family?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
