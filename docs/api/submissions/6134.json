Your issue is with her, not with MIL. And you need to address it with her, not with MIL.\n\nHas MIL finished paying back the \u00a32500 loan? If so, how long did it take? If not, what possible assurance can your wife provide that MIL will actually pay off the \u00a33000 credit card balance?  \n\n\nETA: I would insist on seeing your wife's credit card statements dating back as far as necessary to see when MIL started using the card and how quickly the balance is going up or down.", "NTA at all, as a married couple how you individually use your finances affects you both as a whole. You helped get her out of debt, and she made you a promise. Not only did she break that promise, she\u2019s actively hiding it from you.

Your wife needs to have even less financial freedom. She has repeatedly proven she cannot be trusted with money on a number of levels. She should no longer have a credit card.

If (maybe when) she fucks this all up, you don't want to be on the hook.\n\nAt some point, her financial fuck ups becomes your own fuck ups.

We did this years ago.", "NTA - I would call the card company and report the card lost/stolen. Then they cancel the card that is there and look out for the new card they will send in the mail and destroy it. Could it be your wife is using your MIL to get things she wants knowing that you didn't know she was letting MIL use it? Is your MIL controlling and makes your wife let her use it?

What is that teaching her?", "There is literally nothing he can do to stop her from getting a credit card in her name.", "That she could have more debt because he would pay for her :/ I really hope he lets her deal with it herself.", "Then she should not ask him ever again to help her pay her debts. She is making life harder for the family. Credit cards are emergency tools for the family to use when they need it not for MIL to charge up to 3000.
