We're going to my grandparents (Grandparents 1) for Thanksgiving this year, and my parents are talking about taking my car for the trip. I just recently bought my first car, a used Escape. I'm paying for the loan, insurance, gas, and maintenance on it myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNormally on these trips I sit in the backseat. This year, we're also picking up my other grandparents (Grandparents 2) from the airport and taking them with us. Between the two of them, they take up about 2.5-3 seats, leaving me either squished between them or one of them and the window. I was talking with my dad and asked him if, in return for him using my car and putting 2,000 more miles on it, I could be exempt from the back seat. He said probably not, because I'm the one that would fit best with Grandparents 2 in the back seat. \n\nNow, I'd only be sharing the backseat with Grandparents 2 for a short amount of time because we're picking them up from the airport close to Grandparents 1. I've offered to drive as much as I can (I only recently got my license and am still a little nervous on the road, so my parents are likely going to be doing most of the driving). It's become a matter of pride at this point-I don't want to several hours in the backseat of the car that I'm paying for entirely by myself. Especially not if I'm going to be squished between my grandparents for a couple hours. So, I'm considering not letting my parents use my car. I know that either way I'll have to be in the backseat, even more so if we take my mom's car, because it's a stick shift. I can't drive stick. But like I said, it's a matter of pride at this point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, would I be the asshole if I didn't let my parents use my car, if they make me sit in the backseat?", "created_utc": 1699485077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qyl8g/wibta_if_i_didnt_let_my_parents_use_my_car_for/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My husband doesn\u2019t even drive it because his insurance does not cover him in my car. \n\nOP: call your insurance company and ask if your car is covered if somebody else is driving it with or without you in it. Chances are good it will not cover your parents and chances are also good that your parents don\u2019t carry additional coverage for driving other peoples cars. If that\u2019s the case, then the choice is made for you.", "If OP had insurance that only covered OP and excluded every other driver, OP would be extremely aware of it.

I'd just assumed that as I'm over 25 and an experienced driver, that it wouldn't cost more to add me.\n\nNow, I realised my insurance doesn't cover other drivers borrowing my car, only myself and my husband.\n\nINFO: OP, what does your insurance policy say?

Literally a few weeks after passing my driving test in the UK I drove my brothers car through Brussels city centre in rush hour, and then back to the UK. A long drive like that will mean most of it will be on main roads which are far easier to drive on IMHO.  I'd suggest three or four stops for gas, bathroom break, bite to eat and stretch your legs. That makes it four two hour drives.", "Check insurance policy.  You might not be allowed other drivers.", "In light of this, I think you should let them use your car as long as they are covered insurance-wise.
