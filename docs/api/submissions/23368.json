We also have joint and separate cards tied to those accounts. I have given my wife a card on my separate account and she has given me a card on hers. The joint account is used for the house expenditures, utilities, groceries and our children. We each pay for extras like vacations and eating out from our personal accounts. I don\u2019t question her purchases and she doesn\u2019t question mine. Money isn\u2019t an issue. She has even made purchases on my account in the past specifically for the kids without even telling me until after. I had no problem with any of this.\n\nWhen she told me she was going on a girls trip this weekend some time last month I had no problem with it. It was one weekend with the kids and I easily adjusted my schedule accordingly. I wasn\u2019t concerned until she told me her cousin going. I have a huge problem with this because she is a bad influence and also a freeloader who uses family to subsidize her lifestyle. Our money somehow is always going to this girl and no matter how many times I have addressed it with my wife it hasn\u2019t stopped. It\u2019s family so I try to not push it even though my wife is being used\n\nFast forward to this morning and I see my wife charged over $200 to my credit card for dinner last night. Ok, I\u2019m sure there is a reason why she used my card specifically and not our joint card or hers. I sent a text asking if everything was ok but didn\u2019t get a response. She didn\u2019t mention it to me last night and it seems very out of character. I didn\u2019t know how to bring it up in a text message but it kept bothering me. I kept thinking about more of my money going to her cousin \n\nBy noon I still had not received a response so after considering my options and I decided to do something. Worst case the card was stolen so I contacted my bank. I verified there were no other charges pending and confirmed my wife\u2019s card was physically scanned. I then requested she be removed as an authorized user from my account and to deactivate the card immediately. I did not dispute the charge. She still has her cards and our joint card so I did not leave her stranded.\n\nI got a text message from my wife an hour later saying everything was fine and asking about the  kids. I responded and neither of us mentioned the dinner charge. I\u2019m waiting for her to bring it up first or find out the card is deactivated.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I overeacted , AITA?", "created_utc": 1690584657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cbrrb/aita_for_turning_off_my_wifes_credit_card_while/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It really depends on how the bank does things.\n\nBut in my own comment thread, I had said he may be overreacting by removing her entirely, though that doesn't make him AH.", "If it was stolen they\u2019d be running up as much as possible as quickly as possible because time is of the essence", "OP is also a sugar daddy apparently", "I agree but there are 2 other cards she can use. Her own and the joint one. Spending money from his account seems sketchy to me. It doesn't seem feasible to forget every card except his. I agree that unauthorizing her is too far and blocking the card would be smarter but we've all done stupid things. Also, his wife should inform him if she got money from his account. What if he was planning on using that money to do something with the children? ESH.", "He wanted to get a response first to make sure she was good before asking about a credit card. I'd rather know my wife and fine and safe first.", "Yes, are you okay hoping she'd say if she misplaced the card or something. I guess he didn't want to be an AH and just come straight out and ask her just in case she did make the charge.", "So by that logic he can dip into her personal account whenever without permission because he's an authorized user on that account as well.", "They had previous agreement by action on how the cards are to be used and they would generally follow up after using it. Historically, wife had mentioned using the card to OP, but not this time, which he said was out of character.", "Wtf are you talking about", "It entirely possible she grabbed his card purposely.", "Yeah make a mountain out of a molehill. I text my lady when she\u2019s out with friends or on vacation and check on her usually asking in different ways if she\u2019s okay if everything\u2019s okay and if she\u2019s enjoying herself.", "Well apparently that is the case. So In this post he's a hypocrite because it's ok for him to spend hundreds on sugar babies but cuts her off for food.", "I\u2019m bringing the tequila.", "Oh it is? Maybe that commenter was lying then and just looking for an excuse to defend the guy in the situation", "She didn't reply INSTANTLY. Reread what he wrote. I guarantee he sent the text at like 11:30 and when she didn't respond immediately, he cancelled the card. Note that she did reply a bit later. Texts are an informal means of communication. If you want to find out something quickly, you call. People can't always just drop everything and text back.", "He's making assumptions and taking extremes because of the freeloading cousin without any proof that's why the bill was high. I just went on a trip and some girls would buy a round because bars were packed or easier to pay for a meal on one ticket and we would venmo money to whoever paid. Even if she did pay for the cousin he doesn't like, she could pay him back the difference. He's being ridiculous.", "Wut", "It\u2019s incredibly easy to just swipe the wrong credit card. She might not even know she did it, meanwhile he\u2019s spinning out and taking her off the account without even talking to her about it. It\u2019s bizarre, at best.", "I agree with another commenter that she could have not realized she used his card. It is possible that they use the same bank and drew the wrong card without realizing.\n\nThis is why I think OP should have asked her directly. If he had asked and no reply, then he is fine.\n\nIt is a credit card, not a debit. Unless they have a low limit, it is unlikely using the card would push them over the limit. There isn't a small limited amount of money. Plus we can assume in the post that they can afford the spending. Affordability is not an issue. Kids stuff come from the shared card anyway.", "His own words negate that theory.", "But if she just used it without realising it (by mistaking the cards) than how would she even know that there\u2019s anything to bring up? She\u2019s not psychic. OP should have just been upfront and asked her if it was such an issue.", "I\u2019m sure he already uses it to fund all his sugar babies.", "Well yes, yes he can. That's what having someone on your account means. Additionally it just makes all of the money joint money. Might as well not have separate accounts.", "Problem is I don\u2019t think people here are separating what you are legally allowed to do versus common courtesy.\n\nOf course he can remove her and of course if she\u2019s authorized she can use it however; but that doesn\u2019t mean you should just do those things without communication", "She probably doesn't realize she did it. \n\nShe is on vacation, grabbed a card and used it. OP refuses to mention it to her and has instead gone the path of AH passive aggressive behavior.", "maybe she didn't want to listen to his moaning over 200 bucks", "He talks about spending hundreds of dollars on sugar babies in his post history. \nSo I'm wondering why he can spend hundreds without asking his wife, but she can't spend $200. People have noticed his history and how he is spending the money without telling his wife... \nSo.. why does it only apply to her?", "And until he knows what happened, you can't definitively say she did something wrong, can you?", "You are way too invested in this", "I\u2019m pretty sure cancelling the card also counts as making a mountain out of a molehill.", "Definitely a hypocrite and it does change the situation. He\u2019s definitely an ass. I\u2019m not in the habit of looking at past comments but the info is definitely welcomed. Tx for the info and i stand corrected.", "Either way, shit\u2019s funny af", "Let's see what happens in the update. if there's an update.", "Nah, his money is being spent and she did not tell him why, it\u2019s not pertaining to the children so she should have cleared it.", "Is this a rich problem I'm too poor to understand?\n\nI have 4 credit cards and 2 debit cards. Never once have I just grabbed the wrong card.", "I'm a control freak so I cannot relate\ud83d\ude02 but I do understand. I feel like the post is also lacking information. He said that the cousin has a bad influence on his wife, but how? If this happens every time wife meets cousin then his response is more understandable. Not condoning it but understanding it. However, if this is the first time this happened and there is no foundation, then yeah  he jumped the gun.", "Even still, it shouldn't be so hard to reinstate her later. Locking it would have been smarter but maybe that wasn't an option. All in all, of she wasn't using it on purpose and she has plenty of other access to funds, this should be a non-issue, since she shouldn't have any legitimate reason to use it during the trip.\n\nIf she didn't have two other cards with funds, it would be a lot more alarming for sure.", "I dont know. I think there's a lot of stuff we don't know about this relationship that was kept out. Me personally, instead of taking her off, I would've blocked my card until I was able to get in contact with her and ask about the transaction. I just wonder if there have ever been any other catf situations.", "Ok then. Hear that OP next boys night is on your wife!", "I thought he had asked her about it but she did not reply. After rereading it again, it looks that he had only asked \"if everything is ok\" without asking about the card use. In that case, I agree with you.", "Or she's just hoping he doesn't say anything.", "Then don't use his card?", "DID HE USE HER CREDIT CARD?!", "And? It's the internet.", "Not replying to your husband all night after using his card for a big dinner when she clearly had her own funds is a red flag.", "I hope she removes him as an authorized user on her accounts and talks to him about how hypocritical it is to be able to spend money on sugar babies but not a meal with her cousin.", "He says money isn't the issue though. He's doing all this for ulterior motive.", "No, it\u2019s a \u2018extremely similar looking objects are easily confused\u2019 problem.", "No, definitely not a rich people problem. My husband does it at least once a week. We have a his and ours/mine situation, since I handle all of the bills. The cards look very similar, they both have his name. He just grabs and pays. Then he send me a cashapp or venmo at least once a week to cover his mistake.", "I\u2019ve accidentally switched cards with friends at big group dinners lol", "Its a im an idiot and cant tell my credit cards apart problem.", "I am sure by then he will no longer have access given that in his passive aggressive rage over her cousin he has removed her from his account. \n\nIt seems clear the OP lacks communication skills. Both my husband and I have grabbed the wrong card. We just Venmo or CashApp to the correct account. Why didn't he just say \"Hey, you used my card. Was there a reason or was it an accident/ Transfer me the money when you get a chance.\"", "It\u2019s their account. Not his.", "It says he used her card that he was an authorized user on. Just like she used his card that she was an authorized user on", "Oooook", "She didn\u2019t wait all night to reply. He messaged her in the morning, cancelled the card at noon, and then she texted him back an hour later. It sounds like it was just a few hours where she didn\u2019t respond, and we have no idea what she was doing at the time. She may have been out doing something and simply not seen the message.", "Their marriage is wierd tbh, open relationship with seperate finances. I mean, at that point they are just friends with benefits.", "Yeah, not wanting his money being spent on this leach.", "Yes there is. Not using his personal account, especially on the mooching cousin.", "There is an understanding that it is his separate account.", "I looked for it and I don't see it. So.......", "Maybe she wants a sugar baby too!", "But she\u2019s an authorized user. Anyway I doubt this ever happened", "Multiple people are calling it out. The top pinned post is also asking about why he pays for sugar babies. So he must have deleted it because the thread is full of people calling him a hypocrite for his post history", "And yes people are tagging him asking him to answer the question and why he deleted his post", "That's why I said in another post that something is missing from this story.", "They literally had a mutual understanding that there are shared accounts and separate accounts, and that when she had used it, she would tell him, and he was fine with it. Not sure why you are trying to argue this understanding.", "So again he's TA for being a hypocrite. Like everyone is saying"]}
