{"id": 29011, "submission_id": "178rrnv", "title": "WIBTA if I said I had a problem with my fianc\u00e9e adding a ring enhancer to the engagement ring I just gave her?", "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure how I should feel here.\n\nLast week I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my then gf, & really went all out to make it an amazing weekend getaway, finishing it all off with a surprise proposal at the very end.\n\nI got her a beautiful ring, simple classic style with smaller diamonds running down on the face of the band with a 1ct diamond sitting on top, it also came as a set with a matching wedding band that really makes the whole thing look amazing. I basically worked 2 full time jobs for months to be able to save up and buy this for her along with the rest of the weekend plans. The proposal went great, she was completely surprised & I even had a photographer lined up to be there inconspicuously to capture the moment without her noticing.\n\nAll week long after, she\u2019s said how much everyone is telling her they love the ring & giving me kudos on the selection, etc. I didn\u2019t have much to go off for figuring her style out because she\u2019s not huge on wearing jewelry, which game me some anxiety regarding that so hearing that made me feel a lot better.\n\nThe ring size was a tad bit big so we had planned for her to get it resized sometime this next coming up week. Fast forward to today, she goes to church with her mom and is taking her & her daughter to a museum while I\u2019m at work. While at her mom\u2019s house, suddenly she texts me saying she might not need to have her ring resized after all now because her mom just gave her a nice ring holder to keep it in place, & sends me a picture of this ring guard/enhancer that, admittedly is very nice, but it almost swallows up her whole ring finger and completely changes the entire appearance of the ring I just gave her.\n\nI told her I don\u2019t think that is going to work after we add the wedding band to the ring, to which she replied she thinks can be split further apart to make that space. She then tells me if I don\u2019t like it she didn\u2019t have to wear it, but in the same text says she really loves it  and mentions this ring holder her mom is giving her is $3,000 so it was a very nice gift. \n\nWell, not that the monetary value is what matters here, but I spent just shy of 10 grand on her engagement ring/wedding band and diamond set. So I\u2019m a little offended that she even feels the need to add the enhancer to it, which I\u2019m still not positive will accommodate the wedding band after that is added after the wedding. & I just don\u2019t like the fact that a wedding/engagement ring is meant to be from me and she wants to add more to it from someone else, even if it is her mom. To me, the enhancer is so big completely swallows & hides the ring itself.\n\nAITA for feeling like this? Should I pretend it doesn\u2019t bother me & hope I\u2019ll get used to it, or that she\u2019ll decide on her own to stop wearing it?  I\u2019m worried she will take it the wrong way if I tried to object to it, so hoping for some guidance on how to best approach it if my feelings are valid.\n\n\n*Edit*\nFor context, pictures of the engagement ring, the ring with the matching band that came with it, and the ring enhancer her mom gave her\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HjiheoE", "created_utc": 1697411348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178rrnv/wibta_if_i_said_i_had_a_problem_with_my_fianc\u00e9e/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is like putting ketchup on a gourmet meal made especially for you.\n\nYou would be entitled to feel hurt even if mom's enhancer wasn't tacky and looked like it belonged to a 89 year old woman.\n\nNTA", "NAH. TALK to her about your feelings. It's jewelry that she is wearing, so ultimately she should get to decide, but your point about the wedding ring is a good one. Maybe she can wear this thing on the other hand once she has the wedding ring? In your place I certainly wouldn't want her mother's gift to be part of the wedding band. \n\nAnd my first thought here was WTF is a \"ring enhancer\"? I do enjoy learning new things every day, so thanks for that.", "NAH\n\nThe photos speak 1000 words. Time to chat with your fianc\u00e9e. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she felt pressure from her mother to accept the enhancers. Imagine a misty-eyed woman saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been holding on to these for 20 years. They were always meant for you.\u201d \n\nAlso, take a look at yourself. If you buy a house and your wife wants to update the paint color, would you feel offended? What if she salts her food? Does that mean she\u2019s not thankful to you for cooking? She loves you \u2014 let her.", "NTA, that ring enhancer is gross and you can\u2019t see the ring at all. I\u2019d assume she doesn\u2019t like the ring, but didn\u2019t want to exchange it as you offered. Perhaps didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. Surprise proposals mean surprise rings, but you did offer to exchange. Be honest with each other, this\u2019ll be a good test of your relationship.", "NAH\n\nThat ring enhancer is\u2026 a lot lol.  And once the wedding band is added - my goodness, her ring will take up practically her whole finger.  :-)\n\nI do disagree that the ring is \u201chidden\u201d by the enhancer.  Especially in person, it\u2019s going to be clear from the way the ring sticks out where it is.  You might have a point about the *wedding band* being hidden, though.\n\nMaybe you can revisit this discussion when she adds the wedding band?  She might agree that the enhancer hides the band too much, and decide that she doesn\u2019t want to pair it together after all.\n\nIs there a possibility of using the enhancer with another ring?  That way her mom\u2019s gift wouldn\u2019t go to waste, and the wedding rings could remain as they are.", "I think YWBTA here. \n\nYou took a big risk with the surprise engagement and not discussing ring preferences before spending 10k on a ring she will wear everyday for the rest of her life.   \n\nDo you want her to be happy, or do you want to be able to say that you chose the look of her ring?   Because it sounds like the latter.", "NTA because that ring \u201cenhancer\u201d is ugly AF", "That\u2019s not a ring enhancer. That\u2019s a ring overwhelmer.", "OP, I really thought about this for a bit before writing. NTA\n\nYour choice was lovely. I get that fiance is taken with the 'show' of the ring enhancer (even if she never before showed an interest in a big ring).\n\nHere's the thing that I came to believe is the crux of the matter:  \nIt means a lot to you that what she wears as her wedding/engagement ring be something that you gave her. It doesn't have to be the exact ring that you picked out; it has to be something that is YOUR gift to her. Not your gift surrounded by a gift from her mom. THAT MATTERS to you. You need to be able to talk to your fiance - the woman you want to partner with through life - about this. Because you need to be able to talk to each other about the things that matter to you.\n\nThat doesn't mean it has to just be the ring you picked. She could pick out a different ring. If her mom was OK with still giving her the enhancer, fiance could still keep it and pair it with something else to wear on another finger (but maybe just after marriage/on special occasions...) Or maybe there's some other idea that fiance will suggest (or you both figure out together) that honors both of your wants and needs.\n\nI will also tell you that, I am sad I had my wedding ring sized down when I got married. After my first kid, my finger was just fatter than before, and the rings would have to be stretched a bit to be comfortable on my finger. I didn't do that for a long while (hoping my finger would shrink again). It never did. Honestly, it's hard buying a ring that's supposed to be special and on someone's finger through decades of living.", "My personal opinion is that the \u2018enhancer\u2019 is like putting go-faster stripes on a Silver Ghost, BUT! It makes her happy. To her, she has a representation of love from two of her favourite people right there together on her finger. That\u2019s kinda sweet, no?", "You want to Shane Co. Nice choice.", "NTA. The ring enhancer is hideous! It totally changes the look of the beautiful ring set you selected for her, which she loved until her mom said something. \n\nTalk to her about finding a different ring together or something if she has a problem with the ring, but it's weird that she wants to wear one from her mom that you didn't propose with. It doesn't sound like it's a family heirloom or anything, and a very strange choice for someone who doesn't really wear much jewelry.", "As an art deco fan, I like the ring enhancer. However, it's hideous with the engagement ring. Have you thought about asking her to wear the enhancer as it's own Ring? INFO for voting purposes.", "It\u2019s a beautiful ring! Engagements are difficult there is sooo much pressure on both sides for it to be perfect. Each person handles the pressure of the moment and the commitment differently. Give her time. Maybe she will come around, or maybe she just needs to make it feel more like her or like she had a choice in it. It\u2019s a piece she\u2019s going to wear for forever, so if she tweaks it to her liking a bit more, but is still happy with everything else, then I\u2019d say just let it be.", "Oh, wow. Okay, so I understand why you're upset. You gave her a gorgeous ring and immediately, her mother swooped in and gave her this giant thing that not only completely swallows up and hides your ring, but frankly, it is gaudy and huge on her hand. It isn't this ring you gave her anymore. \n\nTell her you understand the thought, but basicslly, her mother just replaced your engagement ring, and you don't feel proud or loved when you look at it. It is her decision but offer to take your ring set back, and let her pick the one she would be proud to actually wear on it's own, in a proper size. Tell her you're not trying to be selfish, but you thought  giving her an engagement right would be between the two of you, not something her mom would be a part of.\n\nNTA. She isn't either, but her mom is daft.", "I was going to joke that the enhancer was peak 1993, but I guess that's coming back in so it's not the insult I hoped it was, lol. The ring you chose is incredible. Any person would be lucky to have it, but I get the other commenters suggesting you're bold for buying something without knowing if it's truly her taste, because I myself wouldn't wear a ring so intricate. You two need to talk honestly and openly and without judgment of each other so you can get on the same page. You may be able to work with the jeweler to figure something out. NAH, best of luck to you.", "You are not an asshole for being hurt or offended, but honestly, you need to just get over this one and move on. Nothing good will come from trying to convince your fianc\u00e9 of anything other than what she wants to do.", "You aren't being an asshole and neither is anyone else in this scenario.\n\nIt makes sense that you picked out a ring, everyone gave her compliments on it, and she seemed to really like it, and now her mom gives her something that makes it look different than the ring you gave her and that you wanted to be from you, and it feels like now it's from \"you and her mom\"\n\nHer mom heard the ring didn't fit and immediately went out to fix the problem on her own, possibly without asking. Maybe your fiance even wanted it to look different so her mom took it upon herself to help. Maybe they picked it out together and all of this was just to spare your feelings. It's hard to say.\n\nBottom line, if she likes it and is happy and excited about it, this saves you some money on not needing to resize the ring for the time being. \n\nMore likely than not, this style will not be one that goes with every outfit, and it will not be something she wants to wear all the time. She might even start disliking it after a week, or a month, and only choose to wear it when she is around her mom so she doesnt hurt her feelings. Especially once her friends see it and make their own comments about it. \n\nI say give it some time and just let her know if you haven't already, that if she wants a different ring to let you know and you will be happy to figure that out with her. This really is a situation that is likely to resolve itself and the best thing to do is just tell her that no one's opinion matters about the ring or the holder but hers, and as long as she's happy, you're happy. You might not mean it now, but later on you will be glad you handled it this way.", "That ring enhancer looks like a wrestling belt. And the stone styles do not match, it also looks gold instead of silver. That being said her happiness with it is the most important thing right? I personally would not pick out the set you got for myself. Offer to exchange your ring or just let her be happy.\n\nYou really didn\u2019t even find out her size or personal taste before buying a 10k ring? YTA for that", "I don't think the ring enhancer is awful, but also she's the one who has to wear it.  She should be able to wear what she likes.  I would suggest going for the regular band for the wedding, though", "that\u2019s exactly what my ring looks like. like it\u2019s identical. diamonds down the band, 1 ct diamond, and a matching band with just the diamonds. i can\u2019t get over how much you spent tbh, i don\u2019t see this ring as a 10 grand ring, mine is genuine diamonds and it cost $50 for the set. \n\nbut i do agree that the ring enhancer changes the look completely. but if she likes it, that\u2019s really what matters. but i understand how you would feel. however, she didn\u2019t actively seek it out to change the look, her mom gave it to her because she thought it would help.", "NAH. Your feelings are valid, and man is your taste better than hers. That ring \"enhancer\" is hideous. But if she really likes it, then that's what she should wear. Talk about your feelings and why this makes you upset, but don't make it a deal breaker. At the end of the day, it's still a ring.", "NTA. But suggest that her mother's gift, being so --- eye-catching, might be something to save for fancy dress up events.\n\nThen don't ever go to any fancy dress events.", "Hard to judge this without more context but I\u2019m going with YTA. It sounds like you spent ten grand on something you weren\u2019t even sure your fianc\u00e9e would like. Have you asked her if she\u2019s happy with the ring? She\u2019s the one who has to wear it every day. Also picking out the wedding bands should be something you do together. I don\u2019t know if you mean to, but you\u2019re coming off kind of controlling.", "YTA if she likes that ring enhancer, then you guessed her ring style very incorrectly because that thing is REALLY flashy and the ring you chose is very simple and traditional. I think you need to suck it up and find out from her if she really likes that ring enhancer or if she really is just trying to find a solution for the too big ring. If she really likes it, then you need to just get over yourself.", "NAH \nThat\u2019s a whole different ring with the enhancer. It gives a vintage feel, that was a popular style in the 90s. Where your set is very modern and more common. What style does she like? At least she\u2019s not superstitious, otherwise she would have turned down the proposal for it being the wrong size. Some consider that a bad omen. \n\nI recommend just talking to her. Tell her you appreciate her mom making it work, but you\u2019d like this ring to stay between you two. Explain the importance of that to you. Not the fact that you spent $10k, just that you want to keep with traditional symbolism. Does she have an emotional attachment to the enhancer? Or does she just like the style better? Example: I added one of my mom\u2019s bands to my set after she passed, purely emotional, my husband was happy it brought me comfort.", "Why didn\u2019t you ask her what she liked??? The enhancement looks to be a very specific style and if she likes it put your ego aside.", "I don\u2019t have a judgement, but I do think that ring is beautiful and can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want anything added to it. At the same time, she\u2019s the one wearing it. Maybe I do have a judgement. NAH.", "NTA after seeing those pictures. That ring guard or whatever is incredibly ugly, distracting and overpowers the ring you gave her.", "YTA honestly that ring enhancer is gaudy and awful, but what if that's her taste? You mentioned you never discussed bands beforehand so what you thought was simple and elegant could be her idea of simple and boring. \n\nSounds like you need to have a serious talk about what she wants and likes.", "NTA bruh that ring enhancer looks like the type of shit some villain would wear in movies.", "YTA - i dont think youre being quite an AH, but thats the judgments we\u2019re working with here. \n\nYoure marrying her, not the ring. She also is the one who has to wear the ring, so if that\u2019s what she wants and she\u2019s happy, just enjoy the engagement.", "Oh sweet mother of God. The ring you chose is lovely and elegant, while that \"enhancer\" is the ugliest, tackiest piece of jewelry I've ever seen. (shudder)\n\nNormally I'd say YWBTA but in this particular situation, no. You wouldn't be. Do whatever you can to keep her from wearing that monstrosity.", "YTA- I can understand your disappointment, but you took a huge risk. My husband asked me to marry him with a gorgeous solitaire ring, I did not like it. After a day, I confessed I didn't like it, and he knew.  He said ok, let's take it back and get you what you want.  And that is one reason why I married him, because love can be easy.", "I was going to say let her wear whatever she wants, but then I looked at the pictures and omg. You are NTA for being upset about that. \n\nI think it's ultimately her decision, but I think it's okay for you to express how you're feeling about it as long as you are respectful.", "YTA - it\u2019s up to her what she wears, and if she like the ring enhancer, that should be enough. She\u2019s still willing to dedicate her life to you, and now she likes the ring even better than she did before, don\u2019t be controlling.", "NTA. The ring you chose is elegant and gorgeous. Well done, you.\n\nThe ring \"enhancer\" looks like costume jewelry, and the engagement ring disappears in it.\n\nI totally understand why you feel frustrated about the situation.", "Oof, that ring enhancer is awful. The engagement ring on its own is beautiful. I don\u2019t necessarily think YTA but as someone suggested, she may get tired of that giant thing quickly and save you the argument.", "NAH \n\nFirst time I've heard of a ring enhancer so I had no idea what you were talking about, then I saw the pic. It's hideous\nso you're not wrong for not wanting her to wear it with the ring. But it is her finger so she can do what she wants", "That ring enhancer is tacky, outdated and takes away the natural beauty of the ring. It\u2019s just awful!", "NTA that enhancer is\u2026 a lot. What about suggesting the size adjustment anyway just, yanno, that way it still fits properly in its own for days when she chooses not to wear the enhancer.", "Personally i dont think you're the asshole. You spent a lot of time, money, and thought into the whole thing. As a female i haven't met many guys who would go through all that and actually try to pay attention to her style to do something so romantic only for you to feel outshined by her mother. Personally i think you should talk to her about the effort you put, why you chose what you chose, and how her actions make you feel. Obviously you can't control what she does but maybe conveying the sentiment behind the og ring rather than guilt tripping her for wanting to enhance. Its surprising knowing \"shes not much of a jewelry wearer\" but wants that ring pop sized thing on her hand lol. Again personally i think the ring you chose is beautiful and simple. I can see where your feelings are hurt but be sure to not hurt her feelings in the process you know? Maybe encourage her to wear the enhancer on another finger with another ring?", "If she isnt into Jewelry then I say let her do what she wants. she will get sick of that monstrosity soon enough.  She may just want people to notice she is engaged and isnt thinking it through.", "NTA. as the child of a narcissist, is this mom a narcissist? this seems like a very interesting example of mom making the whole situation about her. fianc\u00e9e loves the ring, tells you everyone loves the ring, then following her mother\u2019s intervention, fianc\u00e9e suddenly needs the ring to be completed diminished by cheap costume jewelry? this screams narcissistic guilt trip to me, but i am obviously coming to that assumption with my own baggage. think about it this way, now every time someone asks about her ring, she has to bring up her husband AND her mother? her mother shouldn\u2019t even be in the same breath, there\u2019s no reason for her to be so involved here. are the metals even the same? eek. \n\nmy suggestion for a compromise would be to get her another ring to wear in between both of those ugly toddler tiaras on her *right* hand, not her left. some people do that if they receive a new engagement/wedding ring\u2026 the OG shifts to the R side. i think this would be an everyone wins kind of situation.", "Lolol I\u2019ve never heard of a ring enhancer but that is a heinous fucking addition to a perfectly lovely ring. Def NTA. That mom is gonna be a prob Bob", "NTA, but she is. Trading for something in her taste is one thing. Augmenting it is another.  But, if it's important to her to wear something from her mother, then the idea could be entertained another way. It's not wrong to talk about wanting the wedding set to represent you two, and suggest that maybe finding a way to work out the other (-agreeing with the majority here- hideous) \"gift\" elsewhere.", "NTA. That is not an enhancer. It's a hideous distraction. It swallows her ring completely. It no longer even looks like an engagement ring! It looks like an ostentatious cocktail ring!\n\nGak, where's the eyebleach?", "YWNBTA that is\u2026 certainly a look with the enhancer \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s what I would actually call an enhancement\u2026", "U need to tell her how u feel as being engaged should be. Marriage should be a relationship between two people who can share their feelings with each other.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised that she\u2019s not worried about hurting your feelings by adding on this \u201cenhancer.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine doing that. I would explain to her that you want the whole ring/set to be from you and if she prefers a different look you can go and pick something else out together. Or you could plan get her an enhancer in the future to add on as anniversary gift.", "I'm getting MIL meddling vibes from this. Hope not to see this in BORU", "Talk to her about the sentimental value of the ring. Go with open ended questions .  Does it symbolize anything to you? What does it mean?\n\nTo you it clearly symbolises your relationship and life commitment.  Possibly to her it\u2019s just jewellery.\n\nBy her adding something not even from you to the same finger, it removes all meaning and sentiment from it, and it becomes simply a decoration.\n\nThis could be a good opening to discuss \u201cmeaning\u201d vs \u201cstatus symbol\u201d.\n\nIf it\u2019s a status symbol to her (which it seems like it is), you should open the conversation into what she sees your future.  Does she see you working long hours at a high stress job so that she can have the material trappings of a visibly high status wife?\n\nNTA - definitely talk lots about this", "YTA. You should not pretend. You plan to marry this woman and dropped ten grand on a ring you weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d like (which is **ridiculous**) on a ring she is expected to wear until you split or die. She is making it into something she is 100% happy with.\n\nYou need to communicate your feelings and communicate often or this marriage is dead before it starts.", "NAH.\n\nI used to work in at a jeweller, and the photo of the ring without the enhancer looks more than a tad big to me. Her finger doesn\u2019t seem to have a big knuckle - it looks like it tapers a bit. This mean there is nothing much that can hold the oversized ring on. If her hands get cold and shrink, or if she washes her hands without paying close attention to the ring, it can slip right off. Imagine how gutted you would both be to lose such a lovely ring.\n\nYou talk about resizing, and that might be an option, but the setting you chose with the diamonds down the shoulders make that a bit harder than normal - resizing down is typically done by cutting a little bit of metal out of the bottom of the ring and rejoining it. This pulls the ring inwards towards itself, which puts pressure on the diamonds and can, in some cases, cause them to loosen and come out. Some jewellers get around this by clamping the bit under the shoulder diamonds so that only the bottom part of the ring is resized, but then you end up with an egg sized ring, which isn\u2019t ideal. It might be that your partner\u2019s ring isn\u2019t going down far enough for that to be a problem, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind because it does look quite loose in the picture.\n\nSome other options are getting little \u201cspeed bumps\u201d or a spacer into the ring to offer a little more grip, but that only offers a bit of support and is obviously something that changes the aesthetic and feel of the ring.\n\nMy final comment - rings are very personal, and she will be the one wearing it for the rest of her life so she needs to LOVE it. If she loves it with the enhancers, it\u2019s not an insult to you. I\u2019ve seen women drag their husbands back into the store to swap the ring they chose because they HATED his choice. Some ladies love a minimal look, and some love the full sparkle. It seems like your partner loves the ring you chose (good job!), and she loves a the extra bling as well.\n\nOne piece of advice about the enhancers - make sure the metals match the engagement ring: 18ct with 18ct, 9ct with 9ct, platinum with platinum, etc. Some metals are stronger than others and will wear the softer metal out when worn close like that.\n\nI hope this is helpful :)", "Everyone saying N T A because the enhancer is ugly is missing the point. YTA because it's *her* opinion that matters in this - she's the one wearing it, not you. Also, the enhancer may have some sentimental value for her, so that would make you the AH again if you don't take her desires into account.", "The ring is pretty WITHOUT the enhancer that thing looks trashy. But it\u2019s her decision", "NAH.\n\nLeaving aside whether or not the ring enhancer looks good, she's ultimately the one who'll have to be wearing the ring full time so it might as well be something that she likes and thinks is pretty. This isn't an asshole move on her part.  \n\n\nThat said, I can understand your feelings being hurt and worrying that your ring isn't good enough because it needs addition. You said you were already anxious she might not like it, so it sounds like this is just adding to your concerns but remember, she's marrying YOU, not the ring.  \n\n\nIf she wants to wear it in an enhancer, that's fine! It doesn't reflect on her love for you or her opinions about your ability to please her. Don't think of it as a symbol of your relationship or read too much into it. It's just a very expensive ring and at the end of the day, she loves YOU.", "Soft YTA. While that enhancer is gaudy and not needed. I do think you should've tried to figure out what your fiancee preferred. Whether it's getting one of her friends in or stalking her pintrest of she has one.", "The \"enhancer\" cheapens the look, and also looks like an old woman's ring. Yuck.\n\nAlso, I see your side that the wedding ring set is solely from you, as it is the physical symbol of your relationship and commitment. NTA", "NAH. \n\nI agree it's her choice as she does have to wear the ring. However, the ring enhancer is fucking ugly! It looks like costume jewelry and some costume jewelry my Nana used to wear! \n\nThe ring and the wedding band are gorgeous, and honestly, you did a great job. I understand how you feel about adding the enhancer kind of changing things as it's not from you. I would feel the same.\n\nI say let her know your feelings and why you feel like that.

I basically worked 2 jobs for months to be able to save up and buy this for her along with the rest of the weekend plans. The proposal went great, she was completely surprised & I even had a photographer lined up to be there inconspicuously to capture the moment without her noticing.\n\nAll week long after, she\u2019s said how much everyone is telling her they love the ring & giving me kudos on the selection, etc. I didn\u2019t have much to go off for figuring her style out because she\u2019s not huge on wearing jewelry, which game me some anxiety regarding that so hearing that made me feel a lot better.\n\nThe ring size was a tad bit big so we had planned for her to get it resized sometime this next coming up week. Fast forward to today, she goes to church with her mom and is taking her & her daughter to a museum while I\u2019m at work. While at her mom\u2019s house, suddenly she texts me saying she might not need to have her ring resized after all now because her mom just gave her a nice ring holder to keep it in place, & sends me a picture of this ring guard/enhancer that, admittedly is very nice, but it almost swallows up her whole ring finger and completely changes the entire appearance of the ring I just gave her.\n\nI told her I don\u2019t think that is going to work after we add the wedding band to the ring, to which she replied she thinks can be split further apart to make that space. She then tells me I didn\u2019t like it she didn\u2019t have to wear it, but in the same text says she really loves it  and mentions this ring holder her mom is giving her is $3,000 so it was a very nice gift. \n\nWell, not that the monetary value is what matters here, but I spent just shy of 10 grand on her engagement ring/wedding band and diamond set. So I\u2019m a little offended that she even feels the need to add the enhancer to it, which I\u2019m still not positive will accommodate the wedding band after that is added after the wedding. & I just don\u2019t like the fact that a wedding/engagement ring is meant to be from me and she wants to add more to it from someone else, even it it is her mom. To me, the enhancer is so big completely swallows & hides the ring itself.\n\nAITA for feeling like this? Should I pretend it doesn\u2019t bother me & hope I\u2019ll get used to it, or that she\u2019ll decide on her own to stop wearing it?  I\u2019m worried she will take it this the wrong way if I try object to it, so hoping for some guidance on how to best approach it if my feelings are valid.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like she got really overwhelmed by this\u2026 very intense gift from her mother in the moment.

MIL may not have made that part clear and fianc\u00e9e may not want to offend her. i think clearing the air and getting everyone on the same page would be a great first step. also, if it is a sort of heirloom, offer to get a ring in a matching metal to pair with it to be worn on the other hand. the engagement ring and the enhancers don\u2019t pair well, and you want the enhancers/heirloom (if they are that) to really have their own spotlight, etc etc.", "Dude's gotta check her Pinterest.

This is a ring enhancer for a senior citizen. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of buying expensive jewelry for someone and expecting them to wear it every day for the rest of their lives without getting any input from them about how it should look. Whenever people ask me for engagement ring advice, that\u2019s what I tell them. Buy a placeholder ring if you must, but pick out the real one together, especially if your budget is that high. I wonder if OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e actually likes the set OP bought her (I love it, but taste is a very personal thing) and whether she actually likes the enhancer or just feels like she can\u2019t say no to her mom.

If the ring enhancer is more to her taste then he really had a bad read on what she liked.", "My thought too. Its looks like its from the 80's or 90's. The combination of yellow and white gold also detracts from the engagement rings band and will hide a lot of the beauty of the matching wedding band.", "Holy crap the enhancer is godawful.  I am not sure if OP is the AH, but he should be upset that she is making a really pretty ring look really, really bad.", "Truth. That thing looks like every bad jewelry choice from the 90\u2019s. It absolutely swallows her actual ring! Idgaf how much that cost it\u2019s tacky.", "Tbh - agreed. \n\nKind of makes me side with OP a little", "THANK YOU.

If she showed this to someone claiming I got it for her and it was that hideous with that enhancer I would be livid. The original ring is gorgeous but that enhancer is nasty. \n\nNTA but to be fair, she is the one who has to wear it every day.

Maybe take her shopping for another ring?", "I was expecting something simpler but you are right that\u2019s hideous!

It drove me absolutely nuts.  Eventually we took it back and got something different because I couldn't stand it being stuck to my clothes and my hair all the time.

(It actually wasn\u2019t, surprisingly!) As a kid, I always thought this was the superior method, so I told my husband before we married that I wanted a ring guard as my wedding band. That\u2019s exactly what I have, and I love my set.\n\nSo yeah, OP, definitely talk to your fianc\u00e9e at a later time and ask her if she\u2019d prefer a ring guard/enhancer to a wedding band, then the both of you together pick one out that would look beautiful with her ring~", "Fair enough lol", "yeah, I would not under any circumstances want that thing to be considered as a gift from me...", "TIL Shane Co has the same commercial in different locations \ud83e\udd23", "I appreciate that perspective, thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "No one is expressing any befuddlement at all as to why MIL has stuck her big nose in to what should be an intimate exchange by and between a would be couple.

Leave the kids alone to create their own special moments.", "The place I went has amazing customer service actually and offers unlimited free maintenance on the ring for life.\n\nUnfortunately, the issue is it sound to me that she truly just likes them both, so I\u2019ll have to find a way to approach suggesting they are simply not worn together if that is the case.", "You are right. I am just hesistant because on one hand I can tell she really likes the ring enhancer from her mom, and I do want her to be happy. But also, I personally just don\u2019t love the idea of her engagement ring not really being entirely from me.", "I would, but I love her enough to care about how she\u2019s going to feel reading most of these responses to the enhancer itself, knowing that she actually likes it and that it came from her mom.\n\nI\u2019m gonna attempt to wait it out and see if she changes her mind on it on her own, and if not then find a way to approach this respectfully.", "Oh, god\u2026.

Because you can't get much more 'totally the opposite of what he picked' than that ring enhancer", "Oh for sure!\n\nThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t change my judgement despite how ugly it is!", "I agree, OP should show her some less expensive options online or in person to see which one she\u2019d like the best, it would hopefully put more money back in his pockets. The enhancer is ugly as all get out.", "And HOW do you add a wedding ring to THAT??", "Truth be told, I did not know what a ring \"enhancer\" meant, or what it looked like. And I am not a youngun. They must not be common in my neck of the woods.", "The enhancer takes it from an engagement ring to a cocktail ring IMHO.", "It\u2019s going to poke her in the finger a lot. I winced when I saw that. Just encourage her not to make any permanent changes to the rings you gave her (like soldering them to the enhancer) until she\u2019s worn it for a few weeks.", "I also wonder if this is more about her relationship with her mom than her actually preferring the enhancer. Does ever go with her parent's preferences over her own?", "I also agree with everyone else. The ring enhancer does not look good at all. It stands out and is not in a good way. The original ring is very nice looking.  \n\nI would be upset she used it with the ring you bought her, but only because it does not look better with it added. Had the ring enhancer, you know, enhanced, then sure. Use it.

Don't bet on there being an argument, but bet that swallowing feelings, as a habit, builds resentment. \n\nOnly continue the conversation in person and ideally y'all are building a relationship that doesn't include her mom in the middle of it. If mom doesn't see this as a huge overstep, believe me, it won't be the last one she pulls on you. Who buys their daughter $3k of gaudy shit to cover up her daughter's only major piece of jewelry?

It'll be worth more in the long run.", "Are you sure she isn\u2019t playing a joke on you with this?", "also, please look at an unintentional upside- if she gets sick of the size (which i agree with others, she most likely will) and wants something new/to make some new pieces to go with it, she\u2019s got so many free freakin\u2019 diamonds to work with! they can take the enhancers apart, melt down the metal for new settings, and turn those into earrings, necklaces, whatever, for a lot less. honestly, this could be a huge cost-saver for you in the future. that being said DO NOT SAY THIS TO HER UNLESS SHE BRINGS IT UP. if you bring it up first she will most likely hear \u201clet\u2019s take this present from a loved one and chop it to bits!\u201d i can guarantee you someone else will give her the idea.", "I whole hearted agree with that as said above  that she probably is just in love with every trying as it\u2019s two people who love her dearly, but the enhancer looks ugly when combined with the ring you selected, for your life together.

The only person who matters what she thinks of the enhancer is your fiance, and yes swallow your feelings because they are just silly.

It made it more meaningful for me.", "I personally really like the ring enhancer because it reminds me of my grandma. Maybe she likes it because it makes her feel happily nostalgic. You picked a beautiful ring, her mom added to it which made her happy.
