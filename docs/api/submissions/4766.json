After we put the TV in the cart I went to the toy section to look for gifts for my younger kids presents.\n  \n I never got the chance though because right as we got to the toy section a woman with a small baby (maybe 4-8 months old) and a small boy (maybe 4 or 5) came up with a cart of a few clothes, household items and food and asked me if I could please help her purchase these items. She spoke in broken English and so I used Google translate to speak to her. Her baby was very sick and had a high fever, she told me to touch the baby\u2019s forehead and yes the baby was hot to the touch. She said something about immigration and that she had nothing. \n    \nI told her I would help her as I had just gotten paid. I walked her to the front to check out and the total was much higher than I expected. I only had my $500 paycheck and the total was over $300. So I put back the TV. My teenager stormed off then and went to the car and then texted me that I care more about some random person than I care about him. After I helped the woman I went and spoke to my son about how I can still get him his gift maybe even before Christmas and that I do care about him more than anything but that I have been poor and struggling before and I know what it is like to not have anyone or anything and that if helping those kids have medicine and food means waiting a week or two for a Christmas present than that\u2019s the right thing to do. I WILL get him his gift but I do feel like a big AH now. Some of my friends think I got scammed. So Reddit, AITA?\n\nUpdate: I offered to go back and get the TV and my son said it was okay and that he thinks I got scammed but felt bad about getting upset about it because he knows I love him. He said he\u2019d probably have done the same thing if he had money. We hugged it out and I told him in the future if that ever happens again I\u2019ll ask him first if it\u2019s okay before I act. And scam or not, on the off chance it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s worth it to me. I\u2019d rather risk getting played than thinking there is a sick child going hungry and I could have helped but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s Christmas, y\u2019all. Yes I am poor, yes I donated plasma to pay for an EpiPen recently, and that precisely why I care so much when I see others struggle. \n\nTL/DR: Son and me are aces, he\u2019s not upset at all, and I don\u2019t regret helping but will do it smarter in the future.", "created_utc": 1671064631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm7a1g/aita_for_buying_a_stranger_and_her_children_food/", "score": 401, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mostly likely OP was scammed as this has a lot of the hallmarks; emotional appeal, rushed urgency, huge ask, and tactile reinforcement.  Worth stating, barely being removed from a major worldwide health emergency who invites strangers in a store to touch their (allegedly) sick baby!  Also, not for nothing but babies can be little furnaces so warm to the touch isn't necessarily a sign of illness.\n\nI'm not sure OP is an AH for being scammed (there's a reason people pull this game), but they are an AH for putting back their child's gift right in front of them as a result.

Also why are you touching sick strangers?", "YTA. You got scammed and your son had to pay the price for your naivety. You neither had the awareness to actually navigate this situation and realise that you were at best being taken advantage of or at worse being totally scammed, nor did you have the care for your son to realise that you were putting the needs of literal strangers over him. Of course he got upset and rightfully so. Now I'm not denying that there are poor people out there who need help. And if you genuinely believe that they needed help and were inclined to help them then all the power to you. But do so within your means that don't impact others that are also relying on you. You could have told them to take some items out from their cart. You could have told them to only get essentials, whatever they deemed those to be. As the person paying, you had every right to dictate and decide how much you were willing to spend. But instead you put all of those consequences onto your son who had absolutely nothing to do with this situation, especially since it just seems like you spent all of your money on a scam.", "Yta for being an easy mark.

You promised your son a TV then backed out, right in front of him. Not only that, you dropped $300 for a stranger with a cart full if stuff when you only had $500 left?

One time a woman in front of me was paying for groceries with food stamps and was a couple bucks short, so I gave the cashier a $20 bill and told the woman to keep the change. She was buying diapers, wipes, and cheap staple foods. But $300? Damn. \n\nHopefully you learned your lesson.", "Honey, YTA. You donated plasma to pay for an epi pen. You should have stopped to use your brain a bit. Nobody loads up a cart to the brim when they have no money, on the off-chance that a stranger would be willing to shell out 300 dollars. Didn't you wonder how they were planning to lay for it at all if you hadn't been there?\n\nWhat you also showed your son is that some stranger's sob story is more important than him. \n\nYou're clearly a kind person, but charity on a large scale must always be done cautiously.

You sacrificed your son's Christmas gift because a stranger had the gall to ask you to buy $300 worth of stuff for them. I'm not without empathy.

I'm glad you and your son are all good but if you can't afford to be this generous, then you can't afford to be this generous. You also definitely got scammed. Regardless, it would have been way better to direct her to some resources that can help her long term (literally google a shelter, the Toys for Tots/a Christmas gift exchange for families in need in your area, a church that provides aid to immigrants, anything) than to let her guilt you into buying her one cart of stuff.

I\u2019d rather live in a world where we help each other, than a world where we turn our backs for fear of getting scammed. You bought food and diapers and medicine.

The meals are also mostly relatively plain (bread, yogurt, lentils, vegetables, dessert), so it won't be too spicy for little kids or anything. At most gurdwaras there are two meals every day. However, in some areas where there are not many Sikhs, I have known gurdwaras to only do one big meal a week. If there just aren't enough members to organize it more frequently. Still, I recommend looking up what gurdwaras are in your area so you can direct people in need to them. It's very possible the members would want to help in other ways as well. Some gurdwaras provide clothing, shelter, and some medical services.

He explained that his son was sick, and that he only came out in the cold with him to try and get him some medication (we were walking distance from a Walgreens). He was short and needed some more money and could I please help him. With that this poor baby who couldn't have been more than 2 starts coughing and was clearly sick. Of course I was helping. I got extra money out of the ATM and gave him $40, told him to buy whatever he needed. Few days later I'm telling my friend about this, she says she'd done the same thing with the same man the week before!! Turns out, it was a huge scam the entire time, and this scum would drag this tiny child around at all hours in the frigid temperatures begging for cash outside all the local businesses!!

And children's shoes are like $10, maybe $20. And that's just me assuming you didn't buy her shoes. Medicine is also another $8-$10. So if we total that to $490 for what my family of four uses plus a pair of shoes and some tylenol medicine and you paid $300, you just bought that woman's entire grocery list for the month and some bonus shit for her kids.

I said I cannot and I have to go one last time and walked away. It was very uncomfortable.", "And $108 on a tv. Not the brightest at all", "Food actually can be returned, it just gets thrown away afterward. But this is a very common scam.

I'm walking 10-15 miles a day in broke-ass shoes trying to find some way to make some cash or get a meal. Second, your lord hasn't done shit to gain my trust. If he had, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be homeless and starving and dirty and tired right now. And third, stop looking down your fucking nose at me. It's not my fault that the people I rented a room from didn't pay their fucking bills and ended up being evicted and foreclosed on. It's also not my fault that losing my home (and having to take a day off to pack and move my shit on NO notice) resulted in my asshole boss deciding to fire me for my first-ever missed shift, even with 3 hours notice (as much as I could possibly have given, since I didn't know anything was wrong until I was awakened by huge thumping knocks and the sheriff coming in and telling me to get out). \n\nI swear, none of those folks knew the saying, \"there, but for grace, go I.\" No empathy.

Your family deserves fresh meat and produce, and name brand diapers, but poor people can't ask for the same?  \n\nIt's your money, and you can choose to help people as you please with it, but I would ask you to consider that everyone deserves to have their babies in diapers that fit properly and don't cause blow-outs and leaks (poor people may not have access to laundry facilities in their own home, and the cost to go to a laundromat and pay for extra loads of laundry might well make up the difference in price of the diapers). Everyone deserves access to fresh, whole foods (if they're in the US, they may not have the money for doctors visits, and fresh food can help keep them healthy).  \n\nPoor people are not just sitting at home thinking up ways to scam people; most lead busy, complicated, exhausting lives.
