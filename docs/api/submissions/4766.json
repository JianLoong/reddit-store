After we put the TV in the cart I went to the toy section to look for gifts for my younger kids presents.\n  \n I never got the chance though because right as we got to the toy section a woman with a small baby (maybe 4-8 months old) and a small boy (maybe 4 or 5) came up with a cart of a few clothes, household items and food and asked me if I could please help her purchase these items. She spoke in broken English and so I used Google translate to speak to her. Her baby was very sick and had a high fever, she told me to touch the baby\u2019s forehead and yes the baby was hot to the touch. She said something about immigration and that she had nothing. \n    \nI told her I would help her as I had just gotten paid. I walked her to the front to check out and the total was much higher than I expected. I only had my $500 paycheck and the total was over $300. So I put back the TV. My teenager stormed off then and went to the car and then texted me that I care more about some random person than I care about him. After I helped the woman I went and spoke to my son about how I can still get him his gift maybe even before Christmas and that I do care about him more than anything but that I have been poor and struggling before and I know what it is like to not have anyone or anything and that if helping those kids have medicine and food means waiting a week or two for a Christmas present than that\u2019s the right thing to do. I WILL get him his gift but I do feel like a big AH now. Some of my friends think I got scammed. So Reddit, AITA?\n\nUpdate: I offered to go back and get the TV and my son said it was okay and that he thinks I got scammed but felt bad about getting upset about it because he knows I love him. He said he\u2019d probably have done the same thing if he had money. We hugged it out and I told him in the future if that ever happens again I\u2019ll ask him first if it\u2019s okay before I act. And scam or not, on the off chance it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s worth it to me. I\u2019d rather risk getting played than thinking there is a sick child going hungry and I could have helped but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s Christmas, y\u2019all. Yes I am poor, yes I donated plasma to pay for an EpiPen recently, and that precisely why I care so much when I see others struggle. \n\nTL/DR: Son and me are aces, he\u2019s not upset at all, and I don\u2019t regret helping but will do it smarter in the future.", "created_utc": 1671064631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm7a1g/aita_for_buying_a_stranger_and_her_children_food/", "score": 759, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mostly likely OP was scammed as this has a lot of the hallmarks; emotional appeal, rushed urgency, huge ask, and tactile reinforcement.  Worth stating, barely being removed from a major worldwide health emergency who invites strangers in a store to touch their (allegedly) sick baby!  Also, not for nothing but babies can be little furnaces so warm to the touch isn't necessarily a sign of illness.\n\nI'm not sure OP is an AH for being scammed (there's a reason people pull this game), but they are an AH for putting back their child's gift right in front of them as a result.

Also why are you touching sick strangers?", "YTA. You got scammed and your son had to pay the price for your naivety. You neither had the awareness to actually navigate this situation and realise that you were at best being taken advantage of or at worse being totally scammed, nor did you have the care for your son to realise that you were putting the needs of literal strangers over him. Of course he got upset and rightfully so. Now I'm not denying that there are poor people out there who need help. And if you genuinely believe that they needed help and were inclined to help them then all the power to you. But do so within your means that don't impact others that are also relying on you. You could have told them to take some items out from their cart. You could have told them to only get essentials, whatever they deemed those to be. As the person paying, you had every right to dictate and decide how much you were willing to spend. But instead you put all of those consequences onto your son who had absolutely nothing to do with this situation, especially since it just seems like you spent all of your money on a scam.", "Yta for being an easy mark. Next time send them to an Islamic center or Hindu temple. They will help feed and house them with no strings attached.

I'm sure there's a wonderful lesson here for him about appreciating what you have / not expecting things blah blah blah BUT, you promised him the TV, took him with you to buy the TV and then changed your mind. \n\nHe's a teenager - they can't always process their emotions the way adults can because they are still learning and you just taught him that helping a stranger was a higher priority to you than fulfilling a promise to him.", "OP - there is a sucker born every minute and you took the bait. 300?

You promised your son a TV then backed out, right in front of him. Not only that, you dropped $300 for a stranger with a cart full if stuff when you only had $500 left?

One time a woman in front of me was paying for groceries with food stamps and was a couple bucks short, so I gave the cashier a $20 bill and told the woman to keep the change. She was buying diapers, wipes, and cheap staple foods. But $300? Damn. \n\nHopefully you learned your lesson.", "Honey, YTA. You donated plasma to pay for an epi pen. You should have stopped to use your brain a bit. Nobody loads up a cart to the brim when they have no money, on the off-chance that a stranger would be willing to shell out 300 dollars. Didn't you wonder how they were planning to lay for it at all if you hadn't been there?\n\nWhat you also showed your son is that some stranger's sob story is more important than him. \n\nYou're clearly a kind person, but charity on a large scale must always be done cautiously.

You sacrificed your son's Christmas gift because a stranger had the gall to ask you to buy $300 worth of stuff for them. I'm not without empathy.

I'm glad you and your son are all good but if you can't afford to be this generous, then you can't afford to be this generous. You also definitely got scammed. Regardless, it would have been way better to direct her to some resources that can help her long term (literally google a shelter, the Toys for Tots/a Christmas gift exchange for families in need in your area, a church that provides aid to immigrants, anything) than to let her guilt you into buying her one cart of stuff.

I\u2019d rather live in a world where we help each other, than a world where we turn our backs for fear of getting scammed. You bought food and diapers and medicine.

The meals are also mostly relatively plain (bread, yogurt, lentils, vegetables, dessert), so it won't be too spicy for little kids or anything. At most gurdwaras there are two meals every day. However, in some areas where there are not many Sikhs, I have known gurdwaras to only do one big meal a week. If there just aren't enough members to organize it more frequently. Still, I recommend looking up what gurdwaras are in your area so you can direct people in need to them. It's very possible the members would want to help in other ways as well. Some gurdwaras provide clothing, shelter, and some medical services.

Your son doesn't need a TV and can always get another. You can't say the same for the poor family. He can wait until next time (not next christmas but just when you get more money) to get his TV, or maybe even a slightly better one for waiting so long.\n\nYou definitely got scammed cuz $300 is ridiculous. But being gullible doesn't make you an AH. Maybe have a bit more awareness and skepticism next time.", "Yeah, I was thinking this. As sad as it was I\u2019m sure to see that woman, it\u2019s pretty obviously a scam.", "Yep.  OP is naive (not an insult, we all start off naive in these situations), and should have at least thought about the fact that there are way more financially stable shoppers in the store who they could beg from. \n\nI've gone out of my way to buy grocery items for houseless people, but they will almost always try to push their luck.  You have to set expectations right off the bat and have enough of a spine to say \"no\" when they start pushing.  \n\nIf they have a major negative reaction to you not acquiescing, it's likely some scam.  You also need to be wary of folks who use dependants as \"props\".", "Agree. In a sense she wasn't being generous. She was being generous on her son's behave.", "I don't think this really happens in the UK where I live  but lots of supermarkets do grab bags of food bank items for people with referrals. It's a bit disnegenuous because kost of the items are paid for and donated by shoppers so the supermarket makes money out of doing it but some of the money is from the supermarket", "No, if it's a scam the money is often going to a profiteering gang. They don't need the money more than you it's just an easy way to get it. This is the difference between a scam and someone who genuinely needs your money", "My post history is my child having a life threatening illness and some budget ideas for the poverty and frugal sub. I have a TikTok channel where that\u2019s all I do is survival type stuff. Not even arguing with you just letting you know my post history.", "TikTok is the main place I post. Reddit is my secondary social media. I posted there first.", "My child is out of the hospital now. Not looking for handouts. Fixed it with my son and updated.", "People think I was either an evil AH or dumb as rocks and I agree with number two a bit but what it really was is a lack of spine. When I saw the total I panicked inside. But I didn\u2019t have the guts to tell her \u201chey this is too much you have to put stuff back\u201d after I\u2019d already communicated that I\u2019d get the food. And she was so thankful and her kids were there crying. So I went ahead and did it while inside cussing and mad at myself. \n  \nMy son and I made up, and I updated. One other thing, there has been times when people have helped me so I do feel an obligation to pay it forward when I can but like I said $300 was too much and I should have asked her to put stuff back or just given her cash or a gift card or something. Lesson learned, I\u2019ll be more reluctant to ever do that again.", "You are absolutely right. I have to do better here on out. I agree with everyone, I was the AH.", "No lies spoken, hard truth and needed to hear it. I have to do better from here on out.", "it was a scam lol", "I\u2019ll get it for him in six days when I get paid again. Just gonna put in some overtime hours and earn back what I spent. He\u2019ll get his TV.", "Lol you got scammed BAD work on that spine before it hurts your family again", "I had someone approach me years ago, she just needed $20 more to afford a room at the Motel 8 so I gave it to her. A week later, the same woman approached me asking me the same thing...when I said I already gave her $20, she *ran* lol. Now I only give money to orgs when I have some to spare, never individuals.", "It's a pretty common scam. We were warned about it when I worked at a grocery story.", "Either you\u2019re telling the truth and are just incredibly irresponsible and lack priorities.\n\nOr you\u2019re lying to get people on the internet to feel bad for you and give you money", "Are you special needs and don't understand the concept of money?", "The churches in my town do the same, let people sleep in knave when it's cold and run a soup kitchen year round.", "Yup, no one who truly has nothing, goes and stocks up a full $300 cart", "May I get a link to the scam sub, please?", "Maybe next time just grab 3 things you'd be happy to pay for and add to your trolley? I wouldn't object so much to you literally buying a pack of nappies/medicine for the baby/formula. Then you're also not going to get stuck with a bigger bill than planned. I would advise you if you're ever in tough times again to try and seek out charities and agencies that can help to support you as well as kind strangers. These can also help you to long term plan and budget and try to get out of these spirals. I think you need to try and be realistic about how much you have to give or pass on - you are supporting your family on 350 a week and planning to buy a 100 dollar TV leaving just 250 for the week. Even if this stuff was 100 dollars that does not seem like an amount you can afford to give to someone, no matter how much they are in need. You cannot pour from an empty cup and you must look after yourselves and your kids first", "Yup. That's why you're NTA. You didn't say he'll never get it and your heart was in the right place. It's not like not getting the TV will cause any significant harm either.  I'd just say you're kind to a fault, but as far as faults go that's pretty low in terms of how bad they are", "She explicitly said the TV was put back. It's right in the title of the post, and then clarified several times in the body. That''s literally the whole point of the AITA, not \"am I an asshole for getting scammed\", but \"am I the asshole for possibly ruining my son's christmas by getting scammed\".", "I got a Christmas bonus", "They've got a small child with serious medical issues and little money, but can afford $300 of stuff for some rando in the grocery store. \ud83e\uddd0", "Yes. Including children in hospital and everything", "Oh good grief.", "That\u2019s all true and I\u2019m going to take it to heart. And that\u2019s also a good idea to just grab one or two things and offer. I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t even do that next time this whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth.", "Seriously. I\u2019ve covered similar items at the checkout before when I was in a better spot financially but the person was only short like $20-$30 at checkout and had paid for the rest of their stuff (all kids stuff fwiw) and I knew it wasn\u2019t a scam. I couldn\u2019t justify that much money when I\u2019m taking away from my kids but Tylenol, food, diapers, are more reasonable to me. OP you got scammed for having a big heart and soft YTA since your heart was in the right place.", "I\u2019m just gonna say, not only is this more often than not a scam, it could be downright dangerous. Men will use the draw of a child in need to lure in victims so they can be kidnapped and trafficked. It hurts my heart to turn down people who appear to be in need, especially when there\u2019s a child involved, but there are truly some monstrous people out there who are banking on our instinctive need to help children to make their cons and schemes work. So no, I\u2019m sorry, wish the world wasn\u2019t a place where tender hearted people who only want to help get stomped on, but it is, so\u2026", "You're not the hero you're trying to make yourself out to be. You spent your the majority of your paycheck on scammers. Even if they're not scammers, you still have your own kids to feed and provide for. Now you're not going to be able to do that as easily. You need to be more responsible especially because you don't earn a lot of money. All you had to say was that you couldn't afford all of that or you could have given her fifty bucks. Your son has a bigger heart than you do; I bet he'll still give you a gift but now you can't afford to buy him one. You can't go around blowing all that money when you don't earn a lot of it.", "I just commented the same. I was approached 3 different times, twice in Walmart and once in Target, with this exact scenario.", "Agreed! I mean op said there were clothes in the cart. What mom takes her sick child to Walmart and goes clothes shopping ? I would understand the pharmacy, or even diapers. But clothes!?\n\n Mom's with sick kids get in and out asap. They don't lolligag and buy new clothes !", "Even if it is a scam, helping someone so desperate that they are scam begging in a WalMart isn't so wrong. NTA.", "That's fair, I wouldn't spend that much on someone I didn't know either. I'd maybe pay for a pack of diapers and ingredients for one meal, like a rotisserie chicken, premade potatoes, a bagged salad, and maybe a bag or oranges or something, probably the medicine too if the kid was actually sick, but even just those things are probably close to $100.", "That makes sense.", "My child isn\u2019t in the hospital anymore although he does have heart damage. A lot of ppl have wishlists in their bio which is why Reddit has the ability to add one. I never ask for anything, it\u2019s just passively on my bio like it is on all my social media. I think I just didn\u2019t have the balls to tell her I could t afford it. We will be okay. I can pick up some extra hours this week and make it all back. I did learn my lesson though.", "No yeah, now I know not to. Maybe I'll give them a few bucks but", "Yikes", "Lol, I\u2019m the tall person in a metropolitan area that always asks people in they need help. Even tho I\u2019m a nonthreatening looking woman, they almost never want my help. Maybe we\u2019re always suspicious here, idk. Lol", "Your posts have just as many red flags\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 screaming scammer as the lady in Walmart with a full shopping cart asking for you to pay.\n\nI hope everyone looks at this with scepticism.", "That makes so much sense. Even when eating out I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people are careless about their items. I\u2019ve seen purses on the floor or table next to them. But yeah they can get distracted and it can easily get stolen", "Everyone should look at everything online with skepticism, that\u2019s good advice. Regardless what you think of me I did learn my lesson. It was stupid. But I still want to wish everyone here a very Merry Christmas. Don\u2019t be me, be smarter. Happy Holidays!", "If you got them around where you live, possibly take a look at an Aldi sometime? I haven\u2019t been there in a few years, but from what I remember they were always decent price wise, especially for what you got.", "Hey just so you know, Kroger is having a sale on their butter at $2.99 lb and rib eye roast at $5.97 lb. Just upload coupon on their app. Went yesterday to pick up a 10 lb rib eye roast for $60.", "The son was ultimately okay with it. So you can't use that as a \"wrong action\" situation.", "I beg to differ. Kindness is ANY FORM creates reverberations that continue past the act itself. Doesn't matter how many people vote me down, it's the truth. Kindness is the most profound human action. Those that would leave a feverish, sick and hungry baby because \"It MIGHT be a scam\" are the saddest people I can imagine.", "Because OP got his hopes up, it has nothing to do with whether or not he needs the TV but OP literally promised him, let him pick out the TV, put it in the cart and then changed her mind to help a random women. \n\nAgain, with time OPs son will probably understand and won\u2019t care (sounds like he\u2019s already apologised for his outburst) but that doesn\u2019t negate the fact what she did to her son was cruel. \n\nWhether or not it was a scam, we\u2019ll never know. However, to spend 3/5ths of your pay check on a random woman who\u2019s approached you in a store is irresponsible imo. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think this is a AITA situation, what OP did for the lady (like i said it doesn\u2019t actually matter if it was a scam) was incredibly kind, but what she did to her son wasn\u2019t kind. Do you see what i mean?\n\nIf you promise someone something, you don\u2019t dangle it in their face and then take it away?\n\nWhat if OP promised to purchase all that stuff for the lady and then after agreeing, she just changed her mind? people would riot. \n\nNo her kid didn\u2019t need a TV, that isn\u2019t the issue. The issue is OP put a stranger above her son in terms of priority. Maybe the lady was telling the truth, maybe she wasn\u2019t, again that doesn\u2019t change the underlying problem.", "I agree that an expectation built and destroyed hurts and OP is NTA. Unkind maybe. Cruel no."]}
