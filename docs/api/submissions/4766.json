After we put the TV in the cart I went to the toy section to look for gifts for my younger kids presents.\n  \n I never got the chance though because right as we got to the toy section a woman with a small baby (maybe 4-8 months old) and a small boy (maybe 4 or 5) came up with a cart of a few clothes, household items and food and asked me if I could please help her purchase these items. She spoke in broken English and so I used Google translate to speak to her. Her baby was very sick and had a high fever, she told me to touch the baby\u2019s forehead and yes the baby was hot to the touch. She said something about immigration and that she had nothing. \n    \nI told her I would help her as I had just gotten paid. I walked her to the front to check out and the total was much higher than I expected. I only had my $500 paycheck and the total was over $300. So I put back the TV. My teenager stormed off then and went to the car and then texted me that I care more about some random person than I care about him. After I helped the woman I went and spoke to my son about how I can still get him his gift maybe even before Christmas and that I do care about him more than anything but that I have been poor and struggling before and I know what it is like to not have anyone or anything and that if helping those kids have medicine and food means waiting a week or two for a Christmas present than that\u2019s the right thing to do. I WILL get him his gift but I do feel like a big AH now. Some of my friends think I got scammed. So Reddit, AITA?\n\nUpdate: I offered to go back and get the TV and my son said it was okay and that he thinks I got scammed but felt bad about getting upset about it because he knows I love him. He said he\u2019d probably have done the same thing if he had money. We hugged it out and I told him in the future if that ever happens again I\u2019ll ask him first if it\u2019s okay before I act. And scam or not, on the off chance it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s worth it to me. I\u2019d rather risk getting played than thinking there is a sick child going hungry and I could have helped but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s Christmas, y\u2019all. Yes I am poor, yes I donated plasma to pay for an EpiPen recently, and that precisely why I care so much when I see others struggle. \n\nTL/DR: Son and me are aces, he\u2019s not upset at all, and I don\u2019t regret helping but will do it smarter in the future.", "created_utc": 1671064631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm7a1g/aita_for_buying_a_stranger_and_her_children_food/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mostly likely OP was scammed as this has a lot of the hallmarks; emotional appeal, rushed urgency, huge ask, and tactile reinforcement.  Worth stating, barely being removed from a major worldwide health emergency who invites strangers in a store to touch their (allegedly) sick baby!  Also, not for nothing but babies can be little furnaces so warm to the touch isn't necessarily a sign of illness.\n\nI'm not sure OP is an AH for being scammed (there's a reason people pull this game), but they are an AH for putting back their child's gift right in front of them as a result.  Sadly 'tis the season for this sort of thing.", "i think you got scammed", "YTA. You got scammed. $300? You\u2019re an easy mark.", "YTA. You did put a stranger in front of your own son and the fact that you made him watch you load the TV into the cart, just to unload it and put it back makes it even worse. Also why are you touching sick strangers?", "YTA. You got scammed and your son had to pay the price for your naivety. You neither had the awareness to actually navigate this situation and realise that you were at best being taken advantage of or at worse being totally scammed, nor did you have the care for your son to realise that you were putting the needs of literal strangers over him. Of course he got upset and rightfully so. Now I'm not denying that there are poor people out there who need help. And if you genuinely believe that they needed help and were inclined to help them then all the power to you. But do so within your means that don't impact others that are also relying on you. You could have told them to take some items out from their cart. You could have told them to only get essentials, whatever they deemed those to be. As the person paying, you had every right to dictate and decide how much you were willing to spend. But instead you put all of those consequences onto your son who had absolutely nothing to do with this situation, especially since it just seems like you spent all of your money on a scam.", "Yta for being an easy mark. Next time send them to an Islamic center or Hindu temple. They will help feed and house them with no strings attached. Out of every dozen beggars I send there only one actually shows up looking for help, the rest are looking for cash. Hope you can make amends with your kid.", "I'm gonna get down voted but yes YTA.

I would tell you to ask my mother but I'm no contact with her for exactly shit like this.  \n1. You literally brought him to the store picked it up and put it in the cart.\n2. Let a stranger con you out of $300 in front of your son. \n3.

That's daylight robbery, not needing a helping hand.

I'm sure there's a wonderful lesson here for him about appreciating what you have / not expecting things blah blah blah BUT, you promised him the TV, took him with you to buy the TV and then changed your mind. \n\nHe's a teenager - they can't always process their emotions the way adults can because they are still learning and you just taught him that helping a stranger was a higher priority to you than fulfilling a promise to him.", "OP - there is a sucker born every minute and you took the bait. 300?

You promised your son a TV then backed out, right in front of him. Not only that, you dropped $300 for a stranger with a cart full if stuff when you only had $500 left? You got ripped off and scammed. If it was a few bucks, sure. One time a woman in front of me was paying for groceries with food stamps and was a couple bucks short, so I gave the cashier a $20 bill and told the woman to keep the change. She was buying diapers, wipes, and cheap staple foods. But $300? Damn. \n\nHopefully you learned your lesson.", "Honey, YTA. You donated plasma to pay for an epi pen. You should have stopped to use your brain a bit. Nobody loads up a cart to the brim when they have no money, on the off-chance that a stranger would be willing to shell out 300 dollars. Didn't you wonder how they were planning to lay for it at all if you hadn't been there?\n\nWhat you also showed your son is that some stranger's sob story is more important than him. \n\nYou're clearly a kind person, but charity on a large scale must always be done cautiously.

You sacrificed your son's Christmas gift because a stranger had the gall to ask you to buy $300 worth of stuff for them. I'm not without empathy. But you said you and your son are not flush financially, so he is likely already making a lot of sacrifices/going without. I'm glad you and your son are all good but if you can't afford to be this generous, then you can't afford to be this generous. You also definitely got scammed. Regardless, it would have been way better to direct her to some resources that can help her long term (literally google a shelter, the Toys for Tots/a Christmas gift exchange for families in need in your area, a church that provides aid to immigrants, anything) than to let her guilt you into buying her one cart of stuff.

As he seen, there are children out there starving, and he is more worried about getting a tv? Sounds like he needs a dose of reality.", "NAH. You wanted to help someone and thats valid. He felt like he was being undermined and thats valid too. I don't know how old your son is, but I do know he sounds pretty entitled.

I\u2019d rather live in a world where we help each other, than a world where we turn our backs for fear of getting scammed. You bought food and diapers and medicine.

The meals are also mostly relatively plain (bread, yogurt, lentils, vegetables, dessert), so it won't be too spicy for little kids or anything. At most gurdwaras there are two meals every day. However, in some areas where there are not many Sikhs, I have known gurdwaras to only do one big meal a week. If there just aren't enough members to organize it more frequently. Still, I recommend looking up what gurdwaras are in your area so you can direct people in need to them. It's very possible the members would want to help in other ways as well. Some gurdwaras provide clothing, shelter, and some medical services.

I\u2019ve been approached similarly while shopping. I\u2019m only ever approached when I\u2019m just with my son and never when my husband is around.  You just politely say you can\u2019t help. \n\nYou should make this right with your son and get him his tv as soon as you possibly can.", "How much of the food was essential Vs junk? Did she pick out budget options or expensive brands?", "Groceries are pretty ridiculous and not really black market valuable so hopefully it helps them out this week. At least everyone\u2019s kids are going to bed with full bellies.", "That makes the scammer an AH, but falling for a scam doesn\u2019t make the victim an AH.", "You're telling me at the age of 17 he is acting out because his mom put away a tv that was less than $150? Shoot if that was me my mom would have told me to buy the tv myself with my own money lol", "It is? That's so upsetting. Wow. I know if somebody tried to do this to me I would buy it for them (within my budget though) in a heartbeat.", "Probably those little hands warmers, puts it on the head, under a little head cover and then moves it back for people to touch it.", "I would if too! Her heart was in the right place like you said and her kid didn\u2019t *need* the tv right now, but teenagers will be teenagers. But it\u2019s also a great teaching moment for the both of them!", "The fact that you had to convert dollars to pounds is of no relevance to this thread, lol.", "did you give her the receipt because she could\u2019ve just easily walk back in after you leave and ask for a refund. I hope it wasn\u2019t a scam but like, the fact that she prefilled her cart that much before going up to you and then insisting you touch her baby\u2019s forehead(which could also easily be faked by placing something warm on it beforehand) feels very suspicious.", "Not your responsibility period.  As I said before absolutely do not be surprised when you are put in a 1 star rated old person home. Cause you know this, you've chosen literal strangers over your child. Doesn't matter they had a sick child.  You chose a strangers sob story over a promise to your child.  What lesson do you think you taught here, it wasn't kindness to strangers or less fortunate. The lesson you taught your child here is that everything else matters before them. I am speaking from life experiences with my own mother.  I am no contact with her cause my whole life everyone else mattered more, that was the lesson I was taught when she was giving away my possessions cause,  they have nothing, they need it more. Literal fucking strangers with a sob story,  over your child", "Yeah I was thinking it would be like $100. The $300 shocked me but by then it was all rung up and I just finished the transaction. I was kicking myself a bit. I am too soft for sure.", "I hesitate to ask, but did she insist on a receipt or anything along those lines? :/", "Friend, there are a lot of bad people on here so I don\u2019t blame you one bit for being skeptical. You have a good heart, too. I\u2019ll tell you the truth when I saw the total I thought about just walking away but then felt really guilty for feeling that way. I thought of how others have helped me and figured the hell with it. Worst case I got scammed, best case I helped a baby and her mom.", "It was mostly meat and fruits and vegetables and grains.", "It\u2019s a scam. They\u2019ll return the goods for cash.", "She makes $350 a week.\n\nShe gave away $300. \n\nShe\u2019s putting her own kids at risk here. \n\nAH.", "Lol My mom, too! Okay maybe I do need to have a talk with him haha", "Personally I don\u2019t believe these stories cause they sound like scams. My mom said it\u2019ll happen a lot in Argentina because they will try to scam you out of money and even try to steal from you. I had a woman come up to me at a Walmart speaking Portuguese how she just arrived to the US and needed to sell us jewelry or if we could buy her stuff. I kept telling her no and she tried following us then asked another person the same thing. \n\nTwo weeks ago I had another woman come up to use with a piece of paper saying how she was sick with asthma and needed food. We were at a French cafe and she kept insisting we buy her something there. I kept telling her no because we didn\u2019t have cash and those prices were not for us to give away. She finally gave up and asked next person who came in. Whole thing seemed sketchy especially since somebody in need would ask somewhere cheaper so people can spare buying something. \n\nParticularly I think that if they give a sob story or keep insisting after you say no, they\u2019re scamming. I also see them as staking you out if you can spare all that extra cash and might steal from you.", "Maybe their threshold for helping was whatever $299 USD converts to I'm GBP.  /s", "You know she did\u2026as soon as OP left they returned all of it for cash.", "You spent an entire weeks wages on a stranger, scam or not. \n\nYou cannot afford this.\n\nTime to focus on your child and be a better parent.", "Meat should have been your first clue that she was scammy. That ish is expensive."]}
