That said, her reaction wasn't exactly a surprise given that your abusers, no matter their gender, will rarely own up to their behaviour. Female abusers are no exception to this.", "NTA. Good for you. It was abusive for her to try to force a conversation while you were working and then report you to your boss when you didn't consent.", "Oh whoops I need to edit that part in", "Idk how to describe the tone I used. My best description would be similar to the way homelander said it before the \u201cI am better\u201d speech", "Because I promised we could stay friends after we broke up, but said I needed space. Then I found out she was talking about me behind my back on Snapchat (saying on her private story \u201cthank god we broke up before he became a gym rat\u201d even though I started going way before we broke up).\n\nThe huge argument was because when I confronted her about it I refused to tell her who told me she said it (a mutual friend ratted her out since he\u2019s a great guy and thought what she did was shitty). And because I didn\u2019t tell her, she can\u2019t trust anyone who\u2019s on that private story now.\n\nBut apparently she\u2019s trying to be friends again because if this time I didn\u2019t just take the blame to stop the fighting, she\u2019d rather pretend nothing happened than admit she was wrong.", "We told our boss ourselves just in case someone complained and he said he supported it so we\u2019re clear", "To her credit on that last part, she wouldn\u2019t have any way to know that I work there unless she was still talking to one of my friends (which I HIGHLY doubt considering they all hate her)", "She broke up with me so I\u2019d hop she\u2019s done", "Even better dawg your fine", "If you told her you could stay friends before the Snapchat, you can just point to the Snapchat situation and say you don\u2019t want to stay friends anymore.

We also said we'd stay friends, and nothing - NOTHING - good came out of that and I sincerely wish we wouldn't have tried. Stand your ground, kiddo. It might not be over yet, but \"no\" should remain your only response to her.", "I hadn\u2019t talked to her since the argument.
