Ryan and his wife went on a business trip and decided to leave the boys with us ( Me-36F, my wife Elizabeth-37F, and our daughter 7 and son 6).\n\nThe kids played together a lot and had a lot of fun. So much so that they had a pillow fight in the living room, made each other a 'mummy' by wrapping each other up in toilet paper and trying to scare my wife and I, and played out in the garden and came back in with muddy feet. Set up a tent in each one of the rooms and slept in an indoors camp, etc. I was watching over them and making sure they were safe the entire time.\n\nMy wife and I have a few simple rules in the hosue and our kids know and follow them very well. One of them is, we let our kids run around and play inside the house as they want as long as it is safe and as long as they clean up after themselves. Sometimes this includes helping us vaccum, mop the floor, wash their stuff, etc. But as long as they participate in the entire cleanup process, we let them have fun.\n\nWith the cousins now all together, there was a lot more fun and much more of a mess left after the kids. So much so that Elizabeth said she felt like she entered a warzone when she came home. However, on the first day that my nephews were with us, Elizabeth and I explained that as aunts we have this rule intact for them, and they should also help their cousins in the process of cleaning up after themselves.\n\nSo on the last day of their visit, we all got in the process of cleaning the house and putting stuff in their original location. It lasted maybe a few hours and afterwards, the kids played low profile games together until it was time to go back home. \n\nI just got a call from my brother saying I overstepped a line and I should've discussed the rule with him and his wife and I shouldn't have I quote \"made his kids clean up my massive house as a labor\" because it \"undermines his role as the parent and the primary person responsible for disciplining his own kids\".\n\nWas I an AH for making my nephews clean up after themselves?", "created_utc": 1700140725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wmo0h/aita_for_making_my_daughter_and_nephews_clean_up/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
