I hardly remember my mom but some stuff about her I still have some memories of. Like I know I look just like her and I know she used to sing You'll Be In My Heart to me at night when it was bedtime. My stepmom adopted me seven months after she married my dad. I didn't really want her to but I was never asked. I was told it was happening and that was about it. At the time my dad asked his parents to talk to me about how it wasn't erasing my mom or a bad thing. They tried but I wasn't happy about it and I guess when I still wasn't happy after a few years, their feelings changed and they stopped speaking positively about it. I'm almost 18 now and I still don't see her as more than my stepmom. I never called her mom. They did push for it but I never gave in. My dad has made so many shitty decisions over the years. No visiting mom's grave for mother's day, can only celebrate stepmom. He also took down all photos of mom from living spaces in the house and because of that we have no photos of before I was 7, since I refused to pretend we were a family when I was little. I only gave in when I realized dad would keep pushing and punishing me for not being in photos and for not \"getting with the program\".\n\nA while ago, not sure when, my grandparents told my stepmom and dad that she was not my mom and she should stop saying she is. Dad and stepmom were angry about that. She said she's been my mom since I was 6 and she's given everything to me. Dad said that was not how to speak to the mother of their grandchildren (I have three half siblings from dad and stepmom). It came up again a couple of weeks ago only I was there this time. They said she wasn't my real mom and I agreed with them. My stepmom kicked them out and when dad got home she told him what was said and that I didn't just let them say it but I agreed with them. Dad told me I should have defended \"my mom\". I told him I always do and I have always known who my real mom is. I told him just because he decided he could force a new legal mom didn't make her my real one. She asked what she would have to do to be my real mom. I told her to let me decide what she was going to be, not insisting on it and making a big fuss my whole life about how I never call her mom (which is an issue I've had with her since before she married my dad). She told me it was unnatural for kids so young when a parent dies and the other parent remarries to not warm up and naturally start saying mom or dad. I told her they never gave it a chance and that I was a scared kid who desperately didn't want to forget the very brief memories of my mom. She asked if those memories were more important than all the memories with her and I said yes.\n\nDad told me I need to change my attitude or I'll end up a misogynistic asshole and I will have crushed an innocent woman.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680433137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129htti/aita_for_letting_my_grandparents_dismiss_my/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I might be the asshole because she has been in my life for a long time now, and I know I didn't have it as bad as so many others, yet I have never given in and tried to accept her as my mom. Not only that but I knew it hurt her the first time my grandparents said it to her. I know it bothers her that all these years later and I value someone I hardly remember over her, so much that I said that to her face. But then I agreed with my grandparents in front of her. I said she wasn't my real mom.

And they don't get to call your SM innocent, as she is a big part of it.\n\nNTA", "NTA, that was a riide. So you're 7 and your dad replaces your mum. He doesn't date other people, he just brings a woman home and says this is your mum now. She even adopts you. Most children do not take parent deaths well, they were a primary carer that you naturally put a lot of trust and love in. Then that's severed, and if the kid doesn't know what death is...\n\nThe worst possible thing you can do as a parent is pretend she's gone and not ask the child. Not going to her grave, putting away all photographs of her, and replacing her. Because what does that say to the child? Many things, your feelings don't matter, people are replacable, remembering the dead and grieving is bad. This stuff can cause PTSD, it is serious.\n\nThe next thought a child will have is asking are they replaceable. 3 kids in, it's safe to assume those feelings are intense.\n\nOf course you're not going to warm up to her! Unnatural? Your stepmother has no idea what she's talking about. A stepmother is, to a child, the embodiment of why they feel bad. It is dangerous territory, and to avoid resentment a trusted person must reassure that they are not a replacement, they are not your new mum. And that your relationship is up to you, there won't be one forced on you. What you don't do is sign the adoption papers with 0 input from the child.\n\nYour father is completely wrong. You won't end up a misogynist. You shouldn't be punished for not being allowed to grieve. You still haven't been allowed that time, 2 years to a child is nothing. Your father has done this to his wife, the stepmother did this to herself, and they're blaming a scared 17 year old for their mistakes.\n\nYour grandparents are right. I cannot stress enough that she could do everything for you since you were born, it is still up to you to decide what you call her.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad thinks that women are replaceable like tyres.

How\u2019s she feeling about that?", "NTA. You remember your mother, and you honor her place in your heart.\n\nYou might have warmed to your stepmom more if she and your dad hadn't pushed it so hard. If the relationship had developed naturally, you might have felt it more - but it didn't.\n\nYou feel how you feel. You are not misogynistic. You lost your mom at an impressionable age, and had a new woman forced on you.\n\nReally, the only AH here is your dad. I don't blame your stepmom nearly as much as I blame him. She stepped in, stepped up and did her best. Yes, she had expectations...but your dad was the one who thought he could shoehorn her into your heart. I feel badly for her...but relationships can never be forced.", "NTA", "Nta. I dont get on with my stepdad, thankfully i was going off to uni not long after he moved in one day after id never even met him once as they were dating long distance. You need to get from your stepmums point of view, she feels rejected and has probably tried really hard to be a mum to you and love you. I would look at seeing a counsellor and seeing if after discussing how you feel arranging a mediation session. I hope a therapist could help them see things better.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom are AH. It's so cruel to erase precious memories of your mom in the house you live and force vulnerable child to call mom complete stranger. And the more they push the worse it is.", "NTA\n\nWhen you walk away from them, once you turn 18 like a lot of people do, they'll be like,'But we were perfect parents'", "NTA. Are you still in contact with your mom\u2019s family.", "NTA. If you are close to your grandparents and don't want your step mom on your birth certificate you could consider asking them as a honorary thing.", "NTA at all! so sorry you have to live with those selfish pricks and i'm glad you have your grandparents who are on your side", "NTA. Sigh. I read too many stories like this here on reddit and elsewhere. The story is always the same: Parent of young child dies. Remaining parent remarries relatively soon after (not throwing shade here....people need to move on with their lives). The problem comes when the new couple try to frog march the child to accept the step parent as their NEW dad or mom, and minimize the memories of the deceased one in that roll. For extra points have an \"adoption' without getting permission from the kid.  \n\nThis is hugely traumatic for the kid and ends up with child and adults becoming extremely bitter with each other. Note to all widows and widowers out there considering remarriage. Let your children grieve at their own pace and allow acceptance and love between your child and new spouse grow naturally even if it takes a while.", "NTA ur dad and \"mum\" cant force you to act like shes ur real mother. this was something that u disagree with and i think ur dad and stepmum should just shut up ab it.", "ESH. Your father handled his remarriage and introduction of a stepmother very poorly. I\u2019m appalled by your stepmother\u2019s insistence on being called \u2018mom.\u2019 Maybe she was trying to please your father or maybe she\u2019s just a not very sensitive woman. That said, I\u2019m sitting here wondering how much influence your grandparents had on you  never accepting their son\u2019s second wife in a warmer fashion. As for you, it should be possible for you to honor your birth mother without disrespecting a woman who has spent 11 years as your father\u2019s wife and wanted very much to be loved by you.", "INFO: Is there a reason you've always been so hostile to your stepmom, other than her not being your real mom?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The way he has talked about me remembering mom, wanting to honor her and stuff. He has thrown in my face that she is dead and is never coming back and doesn't need to be remembered or honored. The fact he was married to mom, was with her for so many years. It's also the way he knows without us and my grandparents there is no one else.
