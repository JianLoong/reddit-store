I hardly remember my mom but some stuff about her I still have some memories of. Like I know I look just like her and I know she used to sing You'll Be In My Heart to me at night when it was bedtime. My stepmom adopted me seven months after she married my dad. I didn't really want her to but I was never asked. I was told it was happening and that was about it. At the time my dad asked his parents to talk to me about how it wasn't erasing my mom or a bad thing. They tried but I wasn't happy about it and I guess when I still wasn't happy after a few years, their feelings changed and they stopped speaking positively about it. I'm almost 18 now and I still don't see her as more than my stepmom. I never called her mom. They did push for it but I never gave in. My dad has made so many shitty decisions over the years. No visiting mom's grave for mother's day, can only celebrate stepmom. He also took down all photos of mom from living spaces in the house and because of that we have no photos of before I was 7, since I refused to pretend we were a family when I was little. I only gave in when I realized dad would keep pushing and punishing me for not being in photos and for not \"getting with the program\".\n\nA while ago, not sure when, my grandparents told my stepmom and dad that she was not my mom and she should stop saying she is. Dad and stepmom were angry about that. She said she's been my mom since I was 6 and she's given everything to me. Dad said that was not how to speak to the mother of their grandchildren (I have three half siblings from dad and stepmom). It came up again a couple of weeks ago only I was there this time. They said she wasn't my real mom and I agreed with them. My stepmom kicked them out and when dad got home she told him what was said and that I didn't just let them say it but I agreed with them. Dad told me I should have defended \"my mom\". I told him I always do and I have always known who my real mom is. I told him just because he decided he could force a new legal mom didn't make her my real one. She asked what she would have to do to be my real mom. I told her to let me decide what she was going to be, not insisting on it and making a big fuss my whole life about how I never call her mom (which is an issue I've had with her since before she married my dad). She told me it was unnatural for kids so young when a parent dies and the other parent remarries to not warm up and naturally start saying mom or dad. I told her they never gave it a chance and that I was a scared kid who desperately didn't want to forget the very brief memories of my mom. She asked if those memories were more important than all the memories with her and I said yes.\n\nDad told me I need to change my attitude or I'll end up a misogynistic asshole and I will have crushed an innocent woman.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680433137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129htti/aita_for_letting_my_grandparents_dismiss_my/", "score": 365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I might be the asshole because she has been in my life for a long time now, and I know I didn't have it as bad as so many others, yet I have never given in and tried to accept her as my mom. Not only that but I knew it hurt her the first time my grandparents said it to her. I know it bothers her that all these years later and I value someone I hardly remember over her, so much that I said that to her face. But then I agreed with my grandparents in front of her. I said she wasn't my real mom.

He doesn't date other people, he just brings a woman home and says this is your mum now. She even adopts you. Most children do not take parent deaths well, they were a primary carer that you naturally put a lot of trust and love in. Then that's severed, and if the kid doesn't know what death is...\n\nThe worst possible thing you can do as a parent is pretend she's gone and not ask the child. Not going to her grave, putting away all photographs of her, and replacing her. Because what does that say to the child? Many things, your feelings don't matter, people are replacable, remembering the dead and grieving is bad. This stuff can cause PTSD, it is serious.\n\nThe next thought a child will have is asking are they replaceable. 3 kids in, it's safe to assume those feelings are intense.\n\nOf course you're not going to warm up to her! Unnatural? Your stepmother has no idea what she's talking about. A stepmother is, to a child, the embodiment of why they feel bad. It is dangerous territory, and to avoid resentment a trusted person must reassure that they are not a replacement, they are not your new mum. And that your relationship is up to you, there won't be one forced on you. What you don't do is sign the adoption papers with 0 input from the child.\n\nYour father is completely wrong. You won't end up a misogynist. You shouldn't be punished for not being allowed to grieve. You still haven't been allowed that time, 2 years to a child is nothing. Your father has done this to his wife, the stepmother did this to herself, and they're blaming a scared 17 year old for their mistakes.\n\nYour grandparents are right.

The problem comes when the new couple try to frog march the child to accept the step parent as their NEW dad or mom, and minimize the memories of the deceased one in that roll. For extra points have an \"adoption' without getting permission from the kid.  \n\nThis is hugely traumatic for the kid and ends up with child and adults becoming extremely bitter with each other.

And if I was you I would search for my mother's family to adopt me so I can have her last name again.", "NTA \n\nTell your dad that he is TA for believing his wives are interchangeable and his wife that she better hope that she outlives him as she already knows he has 0 issues erasing dead wives.", "It's ironic for him to call you misogynistic when he's the one treating women like they're replaceable objects instead of people. The \"mom\" slot can't just have a new version installed, as the \"mom\" slot isn't a real fuckin thing.", "NTA, suggest family therapy. A therapist would rip them to shreds for violating boundaries and Your autonomy. Relationships are formed by two agreeing members. You did not agree and therefore there was never a relationship. They killed it from the beginning. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Hopefully you know that your dad used misogynistic wrong! And most definitely keep your real mom in your heart forever. You were spot on when you told them things might have been different **if** they had let it develop naturally instead of trying to force it. Good luck in the future!", "If anyone is being misogynistic, it's the people who think mothers are fungible.", "Yes! I was wondering where the misogynist comment came from. Isn\u2019t OP actually defending a woman against them (her real mom).\nAnd NTA. If stepmom is pushing to be called mom and advocates erasing the memory of the real mom knowing it is against your wishes OP, then she is proving she did not \u201cgive you everything\u201d selflessly. Her motives have been corrupt. If she had your best interests at heart, she WOULD let you decide. You\u2019re nearly 18. Do Mother\u2019s Day how you want. Play \u201cYou\u2019ll Be In My Heart\u201d at your wedding. Find ways to honour your real mom and threaten NC with stepmom for any further interference.", "The grandparents were supportive of stepmom until OP got older and still maintained their stance.", "Her family were not good people and were not in her life since she was a teenager. I would never go to them either.", "Also, your dad is showing you that women die, men should forget them and replace them with a new woman, like they are interchangeable parts in a life.  That is what he did with your mom, right?  Then his calling you  misogynistic is kinda messed up.   His misogyny is showing hard and so is your stepmoms.", ">You are not a misogynist, OP. Your dad\u2019s an idiot who needs a dictionary gifted to him.\n\n\"I don't hate all women, just your wife.\"", "OP: This right here! These exact words! This is what you need to tell them! \nAnd is they don\u2019t \u201cget with the program\u201d, it will factor in to how often they hear from you once you move out.\nNTA. Don\u2019t even doubt that part.", "Damn, that's a really bad thing then and i'm sorry for that, I guess you can honor her memory for yourself, your father has issues if he don't want to let you do it and has to understand why your memorys with your mother are important to you, for what you write in the post he refuses to see the things from your perspective and wants to erase your mother from your and his life by making your stepmother adopt you so quickly instead of wait till the relashionship with her becomes better and you decide for yourself to do it, but they didn't let you and this is the consecuence of rushing their picture of a family.", "My mom's parents are not good people and were not in her life for years or mine ever. So I would never ask them to adopt me.", "If I died, I would want so badly for my son to have someone else to be a mom to him. OP is NTA, and I'm sorry he never felt close to step-mom. But I would want someone to be loving enough to my baby that he felt comfortable calling them mom. It doesn't sound like she gave that to OP. I'm bawling right now at the whole idea.", "My father and his family were everything to her since the two of them started dating in high school.", "Your mum clearly had epic taste in music if she sang that to you", "I think the problem is no one can force their way into being a mom to someone."]}
