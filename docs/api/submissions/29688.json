Why are you dating this guy", "Let's recap here:\n\nYour partner made plans for you to go to his parent's place without checking with you first, not once but for the second time.\n\nYou decided to be better prepared and bought appropriate luggage. You offered to sort him out at the same time and he laughed you off.\n\nOnce he realised that he was wrong about being sorted, he decides that his stuff is more important than yours.\n\nWhen you push back on that he laughs at you and calls you names.\n\nI may have missed some points but you are NTA for telling him to sort out his own luggage. However, none of the above feels like he sees you as having any agency as a person or deserving of respect. That's not a good place to be in a relationship of any kind. You should look into that.", "Take your nice new suitcase and go on a trip. Somewhere nice. Somewhere else. Without him.", "NTA but it sounds like you guys have deeper issues. Your partner sounds extremely inconsiderate and verbally/emotionally abusive. I would have been out from the start if my partner booked me on a trip to the in-laws without checking in with me first. Even if I didn't mind going, I'd be extremely annoyed on principle. And name-calling is verbal abuse.", "Your boyfriend doesn't respect your feelings, calls you names, has boundary issues, and has difficulty apologizing. Doesn't sound like partner material to me. I wouldn't want to go on a trip with him either. NTA", "NTA but why are you with someone who buys plane tickets to his parents house without discussing it? \n\nWho calls you a btich? \n\nAnd who has the audacity to decide you overpacked and takes stuff out of your suitcase?\n\nI'd be done with him.", "'i don't need a suitcase my mother will wash my clothes'.  How old is your partner?  Does his mother have a washing machine that needs a higher degree of education to use it?  And then he throws your clothes on the floor?  Why are you with this baby?", "NTA, communication here doesn't sound very good. His behaviour seems childish and I'm wondering, have you addressed it clearly with him as it has happened before? Name calling is never acceptable and I would address that immediately as it will only get worse if allowed to continue unchecked. Especially as this is a problem that he has created himself that you tried to avoid.", "NTA. He was just dumping your stuff on the floor and then called you a horrible name because you wouldn't give up your space for him. Adding the fact that he plans trips without discussing it first. He sounds like a massive asshole.", "NTA your issues are deeper than this suitcase. He does not communicate nor ask you if you want to go, to use your suitcase, then calls you names?!\nNah. He is selfish.", "INFO why are you dating a man who doesn\u2019t like or respect you..?", "NTA! I usually share my suitcase with my partner when we travel. He *always* asks if he can fit his stuff into mine. If I wasn't comfortable with that, he'd get his own suitcase.\n\nThis is disrespectful behaviour from your partner. He *didn't* ask nicely, and then he was rude to you when you said no. If this is how he reacts to small issues, I'd be worried to know how he takes bigger ones where he doesn't get his way.", "NTA and you could do so much better than someone who calls you names, disrespects you, disrespects your time, and disrespects your property.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't seem to be big on asking or respecting. He makes plans without asking you and removes YOUR things from YOUR suitcase without asking YOU. And then he brushes off your concerns and calls you names for standing up to him.\n\nNot really a gem, is he?", "NTA \n\nEverything else aside, the worst part for me is what you call \u201cname calling\u201d. He\u2019s not teasing. He is insulting you, using vulgar words in a derogatory way (b**** in particular). And you are not a \u2018neat freak\u2019 for being more prepared. He is using words to degrade you. It\u2019s not a good foundation for a relationship, romantic or otherwise. \n\nYou mentioned this is the second time you\u2019ve been on this surprise trip to *his* parents (I can\u2019t hope to know what your family relationship is like, but still), so he should know exactly how much to pack, since he\u2019s done this before. You learned from a mistake the first time (which, again, not your fault as the trip was sprung on you and you didn\u2019t have time to plan), why didn\u2019t he? He made the decision to be underprepared, it should be him who deals with the consequences of not having what he needs or having to run to the store to buy luggage last minute. \n\nOverall, what I\u2019m seeing is he\u2019s not respecting your boundaries or autonomy in many ways", "What you have described is very concerning. When a couple begin to disrespect themselves by name calling, a line is crossed that should have never been crossed . Although your own behavior is somewhat childish ( I will get back at you sort of thing ) his behavior is inexcusable. I encourage you to consider seeking couples therapy or just on your own, before things deteriorate to a lower level\nGood luck with him", "Nta I wouldn't let just some partner to put some in my suitcase without asking first, especially if you're flying.", "NTA \n\nBut, as quite often is the case, this isn't really about just the suitcase. \n\nYour boyfriend is disrespectful, makes plans for the 2 of you without checking if they suit you, and jumps straight to name calling when you call him out. This doesn't sound the healthiest of relationships to me.", "NTA he is incompetent. that is not your problem. for the name calling, do you love that guy, he doenst love you it seems", "Do you ever find yourself wondering how you ended up swallowing back retorts because you don't want to escalate to an argument? How you ended up not feeling like you have an voice, or a say in your relationship?\n\n\nI have no idea if other than this you are in a happy, healthy, mutually respectful partnership with this guy. It really doesn't sound like it based on the little snapshot you've provided. NTA. I think you should keep your suitcase because fuck him, but let him go to his parents alone and enact an exit plan when he's away. But that's just me ...", "Why in the world do you stay with someone who calls you a bitch?", "I\u2019d let him have the suitcase, then stay home to pack my stuff to move out while he\u2019s gone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No overnight trips are arranged without prior discussion. Partner buys his own case to use. He apologises for his attitude over a situation he created.\n\nIf he does not apologise and accept responsibility, then it is worth having a cold, hard look at your relationship.
