Your partner sounds extremely inconsiderate and verbally/emotionally abusive. I would have been out from the start if my partner booked me on a trip to the in-laws without checking in with me first. Even if I didn't mind going, I'd be extremely annoyed on principle. And name-calling is verbal abuse.", "Your boyfriend doesn't respect your feelings, calls you names, has boundary issues, and has difficulty apologizing. Doesn't sound like partner material to me. I wouldn't want to go on a trip with him either.

How old is your partner?  Does his mother have a washing machine that needs a higher degree of education to use it?  And then he throws your clothes on the floor?  Why are you with this baby?", "NTA, communication here doesn't sound very good. His behaviour seems childish and I'm wondering, have you addressed it clearly with him as it has happened before? Name calling is never acceptable and I would address that immediately as it will only get worse if allowed to continue unchecked. Especially as this is a problem that he has created himself that you tried to avoid.", "NTA. He was just dumping your stuff on the floor and then called you a horrible name because you wouldn't give up your space for him. Adding the fact that he plans trips without discussing it first.

He is selfish.", "INFO why are you dating a man who doesn\u2019t like or respect you..?", "NTA! I usually share my suitcase with my partner when we travel. He *always* asks if he can fit his stuff into mine. If I wasn't comfortable with that, he'd get his own suitcase.\n\nThis is disrespectful behaviour from your partner. He *didn't* ask nicely, and then he was rude to you when you said no. If this is how he reacts to small issues, I'd be worried to know how he takes bigger ones where he doesn't get his way.", "NTA and you could do so much better than someone who calls you names, disrespects you, disrespects your time, and disrespects your property.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't seem to be big on asking or respecting.

He\u2019s not teasing. He is insulting you, using vulgar words in a derogatory way (b**** in particular). And you are not a \u2018neat freak\u2019 for being more prepared.

It\u2019s not a good foundation for a relationship, romantic or otherwise. \n\nYou mentioned this is the second time you\u2019ve been on this surprise trip to *his* parents (I can\u2019t hope to know what your family relationship is like, but still), so he should know exactly how much to pack, since he\u2019s done this before. You learned from a mistake the first time (which, again, not your fault as the trip was sprung on you and you didn\u2019t have time to plan), why didn\u2019t he? He made the decision to be underprepared, it should be him who deals with the consequences of not having what he needs or having to run to the store to buy luggage last minute. \n\nOverall, what I\u2019m seeing is he\u2019s not respecting your boundaries or autonomy in many ways", "What you have described is very concerning. When a couple begin to disrespect themselves by name calling, a line is crossed that should have never been crossed . Although your own behavior is somewhat childish ( I will get back at you sort of thing ) his behavior is inexcusable.

How you ended up not feeling like you have an voice, or a say in your relationship?\n\n\nI have no idea if other than this you are in a happy, healthy, mutually respectful partnership with this guy.

They\u2019re a major AH bordering on if not abusive and it likely won\u2019t get better", "NTA, but you might be if you stay with this dude. Guy seems like an ass at best, at worst...?\n\n\nName calling, poor planning/communication, that's enough for me right there. Run.", "The fact that you even think there\u2019s a possibility you could be the asshole shows that you are being mistreated and manipulated. Clearly he had no care for you and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t bother asking if you actually want to visit his parents", "INFO: What about this guy's behavior has earned him the title of 'partner'", "Your whole relationship sounds awful. He made plans for you without telling you, he mocked you when you tried to look out for him, he threw your stuff in the floor, he called you names...is he the only man in your town? If so, have you considered being alone? It's a lot better than living with a crabby dictator.", "Nta. Leave this toxic AH.", "NTA", "I\u2019d let him use the whole bag while I stayed home and had some peace", "Time to jet out of this relationship.", "NTA- contact an attorney.", "NTA and don't ever settle for someone who disrespects you and calls you names - it will only get worse - speaking from experience.", "You're NTAH, but your husband definitely was. My husband never called me a bitch even when I was one.", "NTA! \n1. This is the SECOND TIME he has organised a trip to his parents WITH OUT asking you! \n2. KINDLY gives you TWO days notice this time!\n3. He had the opportunity to have bought a case to fit his stuff in but laughed!\n4. Went behind your back to put his stuff in your bag! (That he laughed and said he didn\u2019t need!)\n5. Removed things from your case WITHOUT ASKING!\n6. THREW your jeans on the floor! \n7. Called you an over packer!\n8. Called you a bitch! Continued insulting you!\n\nAm I the only one counting red flags here?! Your \u201cpartner\u201d isn\u2019t a partner! He\u2019s a selfish pig and emotionally abusive!", "Hard NTA, but your partner is a huge asshole, and there are some significant red flags with this guy. Just assuming that you are okay with him planning this trip and not even asking if you want to go, red flag. The fact that this isn't the first time he has done this, red flag. Him deciding that you don't need everything you packed, red flag. But the biggest flag of all is calling you names because you didn't just bend to his entitled will. This dude is an entitled asshole. Run, run like zombies are chasing you.", "NTA He MOCKED you. Now he's paying the price. Now he may learn some manners. And if he doesn't, you can reconsider the relationship because taking your clothes out of your suitcase is waving a big red flag. You deserve better.", "jfc. I would let him take the entire suitcase, while I packed my own belongings and moved out while he's at his folks.", "...and you're with this guy, why?", "NTA it seems like he laughs at you a lot too", "Keep the suitcase, ditch the disrespectful name-calling man. How dare he decide you overpacked and take stuff out without so much as asking permission? \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Your partner is an abusive controller.  Start putting boundaries in place.  Tell him that you will not be going on random trips again regardless of whether the tickets are booked without him telling you first and giving you the option for planning or saying no.  He cannot have any space in your suitcase.  Not now and not later.  Don't even ask.  Name calling is abusive and needs to stop immediately.  Mocking people's purchases is abusive and needs to stop immediately.  You will want to look into couple's counseling when you get back.", "Youre so not ta \n\nMy fiance's mom keeps trying to do this to our 4 year old but not with trips but with her coming over to the house to see them (also have a 2 and 1 year old) but she'll never give a time or if she does she doesn't show up so I told him he needs to tell her to not say anything to our son about coming over because kids remember and dont deserve to be disappointed by adults who can't keep promises.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your child", "NTA. You asked him and he said no need. Not to mention that he got angry because you showed your boundaries and he sprung this on you. To be honest considering he seems to spring things on you and if he doesn't get his way he does things like this, you might want to reconsider the entire relationship.", "I would have done the same, then walked out with my suitcase and gone to visit MY parents, or a sibling or friend and left it to him to explain to his parents why I wasn\u2019t there with him.", "NTA. If there isn't a marriage involved get out now.  If there is a marriage, get counseling.", "NTA. I'd skip the trip entirely and spend the time he's away making plans to leave this jerk", "Esh where hes the main ah for the lack of notice and back and forth about the suitcase but come on, as a loving partner it wouldnt be that big a deal to give bae some space in my suit case if absolutely necessary, and just keep it in mind next time they say they dont need something, get it anyways and then return it if it ends up unused. Kind of petty", "I\u2019ve been with my husband over 2 decades & known him since we were teenagers. He has never called me a bitch", "NTA, he sounds like a turd. He can fit everything in his own luggage", "Who the fuck travels for a week and doesn't actually use a suitcase? Who just books a week long flight for another person without even asking them? Who just stays with a person who does all the above stuff?\n\nThis is just dumb honestly. I continue to get surprised at the weirdest shit people put up with on this sub.", "You either need another suitcase or another man.", "Nta but stay home and move out while he's away", "NTA", "Are y\u2019all middle schoolers? Jfc, grow up. ESH", "NTA But he is for trying to DARVO you on something so small. He sounds exhausting", "Some people\u2026and it isn\u2019t always the man or woman or spouse or parent or children\u2026just people\u2026need to be told to get a clue. NTA.", "NTA but your boyfriend needs to get a grip. He called you names over this?", "Is he ever any \\*good\\*?", "NTA Even had he not mocked you for buying it, what he did is wrong! He should never have messed with your packing. He should never have assumed it was okay to remove any of your items out of your suitcase or added any of his items into it. My husband and I have been married for 25 years and neither of us would ever do this  - there have been times when one of us has used a larger than necessary suitcase or gotten out a second one to put excess items in and the other one of us has offered the use of extra room in their suitcase and we've left the house with no more luggage than actually necessary but it was asked or offered, not taken.\n\nThat is the problem here, he took it without checking and in the taking, he removed some of your items. Now you are resentful or downright tiffed off at his actions and the name calling and do not want to allow him any room in your suitcase...and that is okay. Maybe next time he will ask - or buy his own suitcase now that he knows that he does, in fact, need that much room.", "NTA\nThat is really toxic behaviour on his part you sure you wanna stay around him atleast do put this off as his personality no need for that kind of language in the situation.", "NTA bout you need a couple therapist or a divorce lawyer, so many things are wrong here IMHO", "NTA. Do you really see a future with this guy? He booked a trip he knew you wouldn't have a reason to refuse, thereby hijacking your time off, but then when he didn't want to *barely* humble himself by admitting he made a mistake and asking for some room in your case, he decides to throw your stuff out without asking?\n\nYou deserve way better. These look like red\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 flags to me- the need for control, to not give you any chances to say no- and you would be doing yourself favor reconsidering this relationship.", "NTA. You might want to get couples' therapy. It sounds like your approach to communication is very juvenile and toxic.", "op is this long term partner? Husband? If they\nAre always like this have you considered breaking up with them?\n\nI know maybe that is extreme but if it is a pattern of events. Is the relationship worth it? Your partner shouldn\u2019t be springing trips on you. They definitely shouldn\u2019t be calling you names", "Why are you even with this person????", "I would flatly refuse to go anywhere with a person who stomps on my boundaries and mocks or insults me, but maybe it's just me.", "To me, planning a trip like that without consulting her or carrying what she does means that she doesn't even matter to him", "It's just a suitcase", "And probably without telling her so if she hadn't seen him do it then they would've arrived at their destination with her missing clothing and other stuff.", "Narcissist", "With her stuff that he took out and called her names op nta", "Did you read the whole post?", "Give him the suitcase as a parting gift.", "Autocorrect upon autocorrect!  I love it.  I'm checking out Canadian music now.", "I have heard you can judge a man by the way he treats his mother...that and wait staff", "To be fair, my mom will do my laundry when I visit her. Her machines are weird, and her laundry room is scary (it's attached to the garage which has...roof issues. And there's something with the settings on the dryer that I don't understand but if you don't wrong, stuff doesn't dry properly? IDK.) That said, when I lived at home, I did my own laundry starting when I was 10.", "Yes!", "It's not just men. You can judge any person by how they treat wait staff and service people. Anyone who treats service people poorly shows they have zero regard for other people and are a shitty person. I've been on several dates with women who treated the server terribly and I always refuse to go on a second date no matter how many great qualities they may have.", "My wife and I stop and see our son/DIL/grandson in the middle or trips nd always bring our laundry from the hotel since that means we can pack less. We tell them we re just like college students coming home for the weekend, but we do our own laundry and actually toss whatever of theirs is on top of the washer in while we\u2019re doing it.", "Heck my younger brother comes by to do laundry as he gates his apartments laundry room as things get stolen if left alone. If my parents ever came by they welcome to use them as well and honestly if they went to bed without doing their laundry I would do it myself to help them out.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he doesn't consult you about trips, he touched your belongings without your permission, and he laughed in your face and called you names, is not cool at all. If my partner cursed at me, I'd immediately just leave and then confront him for his actions. Please don't let him step over you like this.", "Run....any man who calls u names isn't worth ur time or effort. Run far & run fast.", "NTA - But get yourself out of that situation as quickly as you can, because if that's all it takes for him to verbally abuse you, it's a short hop to worse.", "Yeah, if anyone called me a b*****, that would be the last time they saw me again. NTA except to yourself for not leaving this idiot.", "He could be removing critical items, like the one pair of pants she packed. If he wanted to use space in her suitcase, he could have asked and let her remove what was extraneous. He is a dick and I would break up with him.", "I think the issue is he says she will wash his clothes, not that he will ask, not that she will offer, not that even both of their laundry will be included! Just that he assumes his mom will take care of him so he doesn't need to plan ahead. To me that's worth pointing out in conjunction with the other red flags.", "Yeah exactly\n\nIf I'd made the same mistake I'd approach my fianc\u00e9e, tell her I'd been an idiot and she was right, and ask if she could spare any space in her case. Or I'd just go out before we left and buy a cheap case or something (or you can even buy them in the airport for a carry on)\n\nI wouldn't put my stuff in her case without permission, and I sure as shit wouldn't start taking her stuff out of the case.... she could easily find that she didn't have something she needed and that's very not okay when she packed it and expected it to be there", "Yes his parents don't like you so he's visiting by himself. Still just a suitcase that really belongs to both of you", "No, it doesn\u2019t. OP doesn\u2019t give an inclination as to if they are married so on that it doesn\u2019t belong to their partner."]}
