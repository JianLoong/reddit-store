I've tried to delicately convey they probably have things that interest them more than a random white girl, but she's convinced they're talking about her, always.\n\nTell your mom that you and your partner are talking about all the new sex positions and toys you want to try, and ask her if she really wants to hear all the details.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is being ridiculous.", "NTA. \nShe just wants to eavesdrop.
