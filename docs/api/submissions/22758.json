At the time, these things weren\u2019t known and unfortunately, Tommy fell under the statistic of children who lost their lives. It was obviously traumatic and devastating for my whole family. A year after he passed, my brother, Kyle (now 24), was born. He grew up knowing about Tommy but understandably never felt a genuine connection to him.\n\nIn the years since, I have been an advocate for safe sleep practices. This includes cribs being empty except for a fitted sheet and pacifier, along with a sleep sack. I understand this is not as well known in other countries and is mostly an American thing, but it does still happen worldwide. Survivor\u2019s bias is why many don\u2019t see the big deal. Heck, in America, this wasn\u2019t well known when even I was born which is why this happened to Tommy in the first place. The point is, now we are learning and are doing better. It\u2019s the same with car seats. There\u2019s so much survivor bias but there\u2019s a reason why these practices have changed. \n\nEDIT: I have since been told the above is false and that many European countries do advocate for this. I\u2019m glad to hear it. 90% of Europeans (outside Sarah) I speak to act as if this is solely an American issue and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen there\u201d. Was specifically going off what they said. Again, glad I\u2019m wrong. \n\nKyle is engaged to Sarah. They\u2019re also expecting their first baby. Sarah is from Germany. She was telling me about this bedding set she wanted for the baby from back home and showed me a picture. It was complete with bumpers and blankets. I admit I cringed and explained that this went against safe sleep practices and this would be dangerous for the baby. She waved me off and said \u201cthat never happens where I\u2019m from\u201d. I said it likely does but no one understands why it happens. I asked if she knew what happened to Tommy and she said yes, but repeated it was cultural.\n\nI told her that culture doesn\u2019t matter here. She is putting. Her baby\u2019s health and safety at risk for \u201caesthetic\u201d. Sarah got mad and said it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nThat night, I sent her statistics to back up what I said. Kyle called me and told me to stop \u201charassing\u201d his fianc\u00e9 and to let her do as she sees fit. I brought up Tommy and he said I was overreacting. He\u2019s also upset because my mom is on them about this. I didn\u2019t tell her but when Sarah sent her the same link, my mom got very upset and begged her to not repeat her mistakes. I guess my mom got very emotional and started crying. Kyle has told us both to back off.\n\nAre we in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1689877785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154z2he/aita_for_sending_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_information/", "score": 768, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When babies get tangled in bedding, they can suffocate.  When babies just plain stop breathing, it\u2019s because of a brain thing.  The two overlap, of course, because of how babies move, or don\u2019t move, (see the Notre Dame sleep lab results) and both are usually called SIDS. Smoke exposure in pregnancy dramatically affects how babies move, and breastfeeding dramatically affects the stopping breathing.  Bedding dramatically affects the tangling.  But, research shows breastfeeding, all by itself, cuts the risk of SIDS in half.  As places with high breastfeeding rates tend to have low SIDS rates, they might not worry about it as much, as they have *already* done the thing that makes such a big difference.", "Thanks for this info, I appreciate you taking the time to explain! I didn't know that about the breastfeeding effect so that was the missing part :)  I just had a very quick look at some of the primary literature, was interested to see that (at least from my brief scan) there doesn't seem to be a clear known mechanism of action for why breastfeeding confers such an effect?", "What they need to look at is what bottle feeding changes, and how babies sleep. Notre Dame is doing the latter. The SIDS rate when breastfeeding and cosleeping is the *biological norm*.  We need to figure out how to improve on that. So far\u2026.we haven\u2019t, not really.  Other counties that cosleep and breastfeed have lower rates than America.  We know that smoking makes babies move differently, or rather, less.  So that is one thing.  They learned that between New Zealand\u2019s research and Notre Dame\u2019s sleep lab. \n\nIt\u2019s generally a mistake to take a modern invention, and then look at why the original has more benefits, rather than comparing what the modern thing changed for the worse.  It can end up meaning we are settling for less, rather than using the traditional standard and looking for *better*.  \n\nLike, vaccines.  The traditional standard is x kids die and are disabled from a disease.  With vaccines we look at how many kids are injured from the vaccine, and how many injured from getting the disease. That tells us quite clearly the vaccine is important.  But we need to keep reevaluating. When we have a live vaccine that is very effective against the disease, but causes more injuries, (but is still way better overall!) and a killed vaccine, that is less effective against the disease, but causes far fewer injuries (not as good if the virus is still around as the live virus even with its injuries), it\u2019s important to not just accept the injuries, but work out how to use the two together for safety. So, for polio, once it was under control in the US, the safety numbers changed, so they gave the killed virus shot, first, to protect against the live virus vaccine, given after, for a bunch of years, before it was deemed safe to stop using the live virus vaccine in the US.   \n\nYou have to keep looking at the biological norm, what we have now, and what we can get next, and see if\nthe new fixes what wasn\u2019t working, without causing more troubles, while being honest about each of them.

I scared all my family when I picked my niece from crib and forgot to turn off the monitor \u2013 all of them came running to save the baby", "If your mother does not back off and causes undue stress there may not even be a baby for them to worry about safe sleep. \n\nUndue stress and anxiety can cause harm to pregnancies. Educate your mother.", "Yes, this. She can't claim \"it's just your culture\" if you show her something from her own.", "I'm from the UK and would see moving to America as downgrading my standard of life. From what I know, Germany tends to have a better standard of living than the UK. Outside of love or a dream job, I couldn't understand why a German girl would want to move over there.", "Same here , but winter gets cold, even indoors sometimes, so  the baby blankets you buy has to be  baby safe.   Europe has  much more rigid safety standards when it comes to baby textile then USA.", "Yeah, breathing alarms exist , those can be great.", "OP and his Mom should try to find a German source to send her so she can see it's not \"just cultural\".", "This is over the top. Yes, pregnant women do not need extra stress. But there are a lot of studies that refuted the common belief that stress can cause miscarriages to the extent it was believed to be. \n\nYou're trying to spread panic and that's not helpful.", "Anxiety causing miscarriages is rare if it happens at all (there\u2019s no data backing it up) Misinformation isn\u2019t helpful.", "Haha, you can tell I had a child during covid\u2026.", "Pretty sure mine wasn\u2019t bought but was made and gifted. I still agree with all those safety standards though.", "Nowadays it is known that SIDS is often caused by mistakes like this. In the past people didn't know better and babies died. Now we learned and can prevent a lot of these deaths. This is one cause why SIDS numbers are going down.", "Do you know what extra anxiety and stress can do to pregnant women?", "Do you know the harm extra in needed anxiety and stress can do to pregnant women?", "Not a bad idea. \nIf you Google \"gesunder babyschlaf flyer\" you'll find leaflets on the topic from sources like universities, health insurances, state administration offices and so on. \nMight work. \n\nI'm from Germany, too and I was thoroughly educated by my midwife and in the hospital how to keep my baby safe at night. I honestly don't get how Sarah thinks this not a thing in Germany.", "I have 3 made by family members  and I have one baby one from 1970 USA that I got , as baby from a grand aunt,  that has the tag  Not for  use unsupervised, that still get me, a baby blanket with warning label.", "In addition, when the baby is old enough to turn around and move, they are not in danger of suffocating anymore as they then can move their heads and get air. So no way they are bumbing their heads before 4m or so. That's what I remember from when my son was a baby, if I'm wrong, correct me and I will edit.", "I get where you're coming from but do you know what a dead baby does to a mother? Especially if it was a preventable death?", "Yeah, don\u2019t know if it was ever actually used unsupervised. I was a baby, so obviously wouldn\u2019t remember.", "I did, running on little sleep!", "But a blanket, it should be  able wrap the kid up for the night with out warning  labels, parents need sleep too.", "My daughter would move up the bassinet and bang her head and then cry at 6 weeks old \u2026 so yes it happens. Put her in a cot with feet touching the bottom so it took a long time for her to wiggle up. And yes she was a wrapped baby too.", "But what about cute? I mean, sure a kid might die, but... cute!", "i mean safe sleep practice this and that and only sleep on their backs and such. let me tell you, the first thing my kids learn was how to roll to sleep on their belly. you could turn them around 1000 times a night. they would just turn around. kids are kids. and infant death happens everywhere. not just in the us. but it seems they come ever so closer to finding the real reasons. like sleep is so deep the heart stops and such things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i dont speak of the cases were the poor kids suffocate because some stuff fell on there faces and such. but sid cases", "OP NTA. Carbon dioxide doesn't care what continent you're on.", "YTA you meant well but your insufferable.\nI would cut you out.", "Safe sleep practices are huge in NZ too. When I was pregnant I was given a pep\u012b pod by my midwife so that if I wanted to bed share my son would still be in his own, empty space. We also get a whole booklet about safe sleep practices when you first visit your midwife then again once you\u2019ve given birth. Survivors bias is huge though. My MIL made bumpers for our sons cot and was very offended when I didn\u2019t use them because her kids had them and were fine. NTA.", "It\u2019s not your child, Your TA, And i agree with them saying your pretty much harassing them.", "I'm going with NAH, you passed on the information a day at the end of the day its up to SIL what she chooses to do. Mine had pool noodles on the cot bars and top of the sides to stop them biting and head banging the cot. Never used sleep bags and had blankets cause both needed to be able to hold their feet. Basically do what works for you within reason.", "Nta.  Any new parents need that info and I'm so sorry for your loss and that it wasn't provided to your family", "I am German, can confirm. While baby me slept with a really thick baby duvet that basically looked like a really filled German pillow (the square ones), my niece only gets a sleeping sack. \n\nWhile the blanket was pretty standard 30 or even 20 years ago, it is not now.", "It\u2019s not even true about the \u201ccultural differences\u201d anyway! Safe sleeping practices have been known for a long time in many European countries, including Germany.", "It really is tragic that the worst people on the planet never have a single issue conceiving and birthing child after child to be awful parents to.  It's basically the underlying theme of this subreddit: selfish and/or unprepared adults selfishly spawning without any intention of being decent parents to their innocent children.\n\n\"This blankie is cute enough to risk my infant's life!\"  And the universe will probably see fit to give her six more to mistreat and risk.", ">My mom probably won\u2019t stop but I can\u2019t stop that.\n\nShe needs to stop, otherwise she won't have any relationship with the grandchild.\n\nSarah has her own cultural background, with her own understanding of the correct way to let a baby sleep.  Telling her she's wrong an ignorant is not going to get her to change her ways.", "One thing to keep in mind is that in Europe this has been a thing for a long time and things do work differently here. \n\nSo if you talk to a random person here and ask if there are classes, adocacy groups or teachings they will tell you there are not. But in The Netherlands for instance, every newborn is assigned a postnatal nurse, that comes to the home, checks the sleeping arrangements and accomodation for safety and helps the mother during the first 10 days or so to make sure everyone is safe. It's not a class, it's not teaching, it's help... but it achieves the same goal.\n\nI had my children 1,5 years apart, and the sleeping arrangements between the two were different, the programs follow newest insights. \n\nSo also please tell your mother: Germany is an educated country, there is a very low baby mortality rate, the safety concerns may be adressed differently but rest assured that they will be. The more she pushes, the more difficult it will be for DIL to get rid of the bedding when the nurse advizes it.", "She would be because she\u2019s not the parent therefore she doesn\u2019t get a say. The child\u2019s parents have made it very clear that she needs to stop. She\u2019ll only be the AH if she continues to press the subject. She\u2019s not the AH for expressing initial concern", "Right? I cosleep with my babies and always will. The fact that there are women with infertility has no merit on my sleeping choices. This is one of the dumbest comments I\u2019ve read", "I\u2019m finding it hard going back to work after the standard 6 months of maternity leave where I\u2019m from (and dealing with a lot of comments from other mothers that I\u2019m going back very early/would I not take some additional leave etc). I absolutely cannot imagine the lunacy of 6 weeks maternity leave that they get in the states", "\"Stop beating that child.\"\n\"Thanks for your interest, but I'm gonna keep doing it.\"\n\"Every expert on the planet agrees that beating the shit out of children is bad for their development.\"\n\"How dare you, that's MY child's future to risk, you're such an asshole for giving a damn.\"\n\nThat's how that logic sounds, lol", "I've had several miscarriages. I've looked into this in detail. I'm not spreading panic you need to not make up things that have not been said. \nI am saying that they have made their point and need to back off now.", "I'm not sure how many miscarriages you have had. I've had several. And I've looked into the matter in detail. Being educated about all aspects is important not just safe sleeping.", "The idea of safe sleep has become common not the fact babies are dying. It's only been advocated recently with America. And you are right it is down to poverty, racism and a very backwards healthcare system \n\nEurope has a high sage sleep rate compared. It's not a competition you guys are right but statistics don't lie.", "Suffocation is often put under the SIDS, but it is not strictly correct. Sudden infant death syndrome in babies and adults is when they die suddenly with no medical explanation.", "If information on how her actions can cause a death of a child causes her extra anxiety and stress, then maybe she should rethink her plan?\n\nEdit, the commenter deleted their comments, but I'll add anyway: the pregnant lady should rethink her plan, not op or her mother.", "I know what a miscarriage does. I've had several. 8ve looked into it in detail.\n\nI know that stress is harmful in pregnancy without a doubt. And I know that they have pointed it out to her about safe sleeping and now they need to not hound her daily.", "Op has said her mum won't stop bugging the pregnant lady. \n\nDo you think that's going to be healthy for her. Or her pregnancy.\n\nI've had several miscarriages and looked into this matter in detail. If you can't be kind atleast don't harass people. And according to op her mother will be harassing the pregnant woman.", "Absolutely you are the asshole. YTA in a big way. You don't stress and expectant mother out with the idea she is going to kill her child with a blanket\n\nAlso, I coslept with my kids which is extremely common and can be done safely. Every parent had the innate right to choose how their baby sleeps and it's not your job to police how they do it. Period. You gave her information and she didn't accept it. \n\nI absolutely cannot stand people who drive under the speed limit, it's not safe and causes a road hazard, but they are allowed to feel like they are being safe even when they aren't. You're allowed to feel like your being safe even though your actually causing harm (a stark lonely hed with no comfort but a bag around your arms isn't comfort) but you're not allowed to force anyone to conform to your version of safe.", ">I understand this is not as well known in other countries and is mostly an American thing\n\nI had my kids 16 years ago in the Netherlands and was informed about it by the midwife, pediatric office etc and my kids slept exactly like you described. Nothing American about it.", "NTA for trying to help, but you wouldn\u2019t be if you kept on at them. \nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you", "NTA! When my son was a baby, I put him to take a nap after his bath and put his towel to dry on the side of the crib. I don\u2019t know what it was that made me go check on him. The apartment was so quiet that day and I thought I heard him making weird noises. The towel had fallen onto his face and he couldn\u2019t breath. It\u2019s been 20 years and I still remember the panic I felt that day. If I hadn\u2019t checked on him he would\u2019ve been dead. This is a story I always tell young mothers. Crib safety is not a joke. Also, even though I live in Canada now, I\u2019m not originally from here so her excuse of this doesn\u2019t happen where she\u2019s from is bs.", "NTA you did the right thing and your SIL needs to shove her pride and actually listen to you and your mother who has had first hand experience with what can go wrong. Does she seriously think Tommy only died because he was American and that her baby will be fine because it will be half German? That's freaking ridiculous.", "So Germany is immune to SIDS? Wow. \n\nNTA", "NTA .... Is Sarah from the literal Black Forest? Safe sleep practices are a huge thing in Germany. The government recommendations are evidence-based and heavily communicated to new parents.", "I'm glad you have said this. It took me 8 months to stop believing my baby might die in his sleep. No rime or reason. Bit of a traumatic birth but we were/ still are both healthy. I would stay awake and just watch his chest rise and fall. It was worse when he would get sick. Especially with covid at about 4 months old. Them I stayed awake with my hand on his chest feeling it rise and fall as well as seeing it. I also had it at the same time so was especially rough. \n\nAfter 8 months old I was fine unless he was sick. He's 18months old atm so going strong. Bit less attitude would be nice though haha. He threw his fire truck today because he refused to have his nap and was overtired. Not looking forward to teenage years.", "Also here https://www.dgkj.de/eltern/dgkj-elterninformationen/elterninfo-sicherer-schlaf", "She won\u2019t have a relationship with her grandchild if she won\u2019t stop.", "There is equipment which monitors the breathing of the baby in the sleep and for a chunk more money even the Oxygen saturation of the blood of the baby. Angel care is just a breathing monitor which is supposed to work really well and in Germany also available, also in second hand form. So maybe you can give them something like that as a present for the baby shower or for the birth? On eBay there are at least many available offerings in Germany.", "I want to give you an example that might help you relate to them or the people on here.\n\nImagine you were overweight, frequently eating unhealthy stuff and not exercising enough.\n\nHow would it make you feel if your sister in law constantly sent you links to mortality rates, diabetes prevention sites, gym subscriptions, etc.?  \nAnd for the people that do this to their obese peers, how successful do you think this approach is in actually helping them lose weight?", "This is the official recommendation in Germany from the society for pediatrics.\nAbsolutely not a culture thing, she is just dumb.\nPlease send her this link. It's exactly what is recommend in America as well.\n\nhttps://www.dgkj.de/eltern/dgkj-elterninformationen/elterninfo-sicherer-schlaf", "This is the German recommendation\nhttps://www.dgkj.de/eltern/dgkj-elterninformationen/elterninfo-sicherer-schlaf", "Here you go\nhttps://www.dgkj.de/eltern/dgkj-elterninformationen/elterninfo-sicherer-schlaf\n\nSame advice as America.", "I did 6 months and found it very hard going back, but if it's what you need to do, it's what you need to do. You will manage and overcome. \nI had those same types of comments from some mum's, I also had others telling me they couldn't stay off work for that long, wasn't I bored etc etc. \nYou'll get shitty comments no matter what choice you make so don't sweat it (easier said than done I know), you know what's best for you and yours. Those making the comments don't.", "Except beating a child is illegal. You can say \u201csorry but ima keep doing it\u201d and then you get arrested. Good luck if OP calls the police over crib bumpers. Nothing will happen to the parents as it\u2019s not illegal. Cosleeping is normal and natural and only increases the secure attachment unlike beating which is not normal or natural and harms the attachment", "Anti-natal is another word for birth control..."]}
