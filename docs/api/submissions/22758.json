At the time, these things weren\u2019t known and unfortunately, Tommy fell under the statistic of children who lost their lives. It was obviously traumatic and devastating for my whole family. A year after he passed, my brother, Kyle (now 24), was born. He grew up knowing about Tommy but understandably never felt a genuine connection to him.\n\nIn the years since, I have been an advocate for safe sleep practices. This includes cribs being empty except for a fitted sheet and pacifier, along with a sleep sack. I understand this is not as well known in other countries and is mostly an American thing, but it does still happen worldwide. Survivor\u2019s bias is why many don\u2019t see the big deal. Heck, in America, this wasn\u2019t well known when even I was born which is why this happened to Tommy in the first place. The point is, now we are learning and are doing better. It\u2019s the same with car seats. There\u2019s so much survivor bias but there\u2019s a reason why these practices have changed. \n\nEDIT: I have since been told the above is false and that many European countries do advocate for this. I\u2019m glad to hear it. 90% of Europeans (outside Sarah) I speak to act as if this is solely an American issue and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen there\u201d. Was specifically going off what they said. Again, glad I\u2019m wrong. \n\nKyle is engaged to Sarah. They\u2019re also expecting their first baby. Sarah is from Germany. She was telling me about this bedding set she wanted for the baby from back home and showed me a picture. It was complete with bumpers and blankets. I admit I cringed and explained that this went against safe sleep practices and this would be dangerous for the baby. She waved me off and said \u201cthat never happens where I\u2019m from\u201d. I said it likely does but no one understands why it happens. I asked if she knew what happened to Tommy and she said yes, but repeated it was cultural.\n\nI told her that culture doesn\u2019t matter here. She is putting. Her baby\u2019s health and safety at risk for \u201caesthetic\u201d. Sarah got mad and said it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nThat night, I sent her statistics to back up what I said. Kyle called me and told me to stop \u201charassing\u201d his fianc\u00e9 and to let her do as she sees fit. I brought up Tommy and he said I was overreacting. He\u2019s also upset because my mom is on them about this. I didn\u2019t tell her but when Sarah sent her the same link, my mom got very upset and begged her to not repeat her mistakes. I guess my mom got very emotional and started crying. Kyle has told us both to back off.\n\nAre we in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1689877785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154z2he/aita_for_sending_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_information/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Expecting couples become effing pioneers in a new world they believe only they control and define, I've observed. They get extremely prickly about anything relating to parenting.

Your mom should definitely back off too because they could shut her out to the extent that she misses time with the baby. Expecting s child is drama enough for them without stirring the pot over decisions that are not yours to make. Your heart is in the right place and you've made them aware, but trust me a sibling's child is such a wonderful thing to experience so it's worth keeping your powder dry early on--they won't stop making uniformed choices or mistakes and you won't want a bad reputation when you're looking out for your niece or nephew through they're childhood.", "NTA they are not caring about their unborn child.
