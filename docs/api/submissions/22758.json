At the time, these things weren\u2019t known and unfortunately, Tommy fell under the statistic of children who lost their lives. It was obviously traumatic and devastating for my whole family. A year after he passed, my brother, Kyle (now 24), was born. He grew up knowing about Tommy but understandably never felt a genuine connection to him.\n\nIn the years since, I have been an advocate for safe sleep practices. This includes cribs being empty except for a fitted sheet and pacifier, along with a sleep sack. I understand this is not as well known in other countries and is mostly an American thing, but it does still happen worldwide. Survivor\u2019s bias is why many don\u2019t see the big deal. Heck, in America, this wasn\u2019t well known when even I was born which is why this happened to Tommy in the first place. The point is, now we are learning and are doing better. It\u2019s the same with car seats. There\u2019s so much survivor bias but there\u2019s a reason why these practices have changed. \n\nEDIT: I have since been told the above is false and that many European countries do advocate for this. I\u2019m glad to hear it. 90% of Europeans (outside Sarah) I speak to act as if this is solely an American issue and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen there\u201d. Was specifically going off what they said. Again, glad I\u2019m wrong. \n\nKyle is engaged to Sarah. They\u2019re also expecting their first baby. Sarah is from Germany. She was telling me about this bedding set she wanted for the baby from back home and showed me a picture. It was complete with bumpers and blankets. I admit I cringed and explained that this went against safe sleep practices and this would be dangerous for the baby. She waved me off and said \u201cthat never happens where I\u2019m from\u201d. I said it likely does but no one understands why it happens. I asked if she knew what happened to Tommy and she said yes, but repeated it was cultural.\n\nI told her that culture doesn\u2019t matter here. She is putting. Her baby\u2019s health and safety at risk for \u201caesthetic\u201d. Sarah got mad and said it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nThat night, I sent her statistics to back up what I said. Kyle called me and told me to stop \u201charassing\u201d his fianc\u00e9 and to let her do as she sees fit. I brought up Tommy and he said I was overreacting. He\u2019s also upset because my mom is on them about this. I didn\u2019t tell her but when Sarah sent her the same link, my mom got very upset and begged her to not repeat her mistakes. I guess my mom got very emotional and started crying. Kyle has told us both to back off.\n\nAre we in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1689877785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154z2he/aita_for_sending_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_information/", "score": 425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When babies get tangled in bedding, they can suffocate.  When babies just plain stop breathing, it\u2019s because of a brain thing.  The two overlap, of course, because of how babies move, or don\u2019t move, (see the Notre Dame sleep lab results) and both are usually called SIDS. Smoke exposure in pregnancy dramatically affects how babies move, and breastfeeding dramatically affects the stopping breathing.  Bedding dramatically affects the tangling.  But, research shows breastfeeding, all by itself, cuts the risk of SIDS in half.  As places with high breastfeeding rates tend to have low SIDS rates, they might not worry about it as much, as they have *already* done the thing that makes such a big difference.", "Thanks for this info, I appreciate you taking the time to explain! I didn't know that about the breastfeeding effect so that was the missing part :)  I just had a very quick look at some of the primary literature, was interested to see that (at least from my brief scan) there doesn't seem to be a clear known mechanism of action for why breastfeeding confers such an effect?", "What they need to look at is what bottle feeding changes, and how babies sleep. Notre Dame is doing the latter. The SIDS rate when breastfeeding and cosleeping is the *biological norm*.  We need to figure out how to improve on that. So far\u2026.we haven\u2019t, not really.  Other counties that cosleep and breastfeed have lower rates than America.  We know that smoking makes babies move differently, or rather, less.  So that is one thing.  They learned that between New Zealand\u2019s research and Notre Dame\u2019s sleep lab. \n\nIt\u2019s generally a mistake to take a modern invention, and then look at why the original has more benefits, rather than comparing what the modern thing changed for the worse.  It can end up meaning we are settling for less, rather than using the traditional standard and looking for *better*.  \n\nLike, vaccines.  The traditional standard is x kids die and are disabled from a disease.  With vaccines we look at how many kids are injured from the vaccine, and how many injured from getting the disease. That tells us quite clearly the vaccine is important.  But we need to keep reevaluating. When we have a live vaccine that is very effective against the disease, but causes more injuries, (but is still way better overall!) and a killed vaccine, that is less effective against the disease, but causes far fewer injuries (not as good if the virus is still around as the live virus even with its injuries), it\u2019s important to not just accept the injuries, but work out how to use the two together for safety. So, for polio, once it was under control in the US, the safety numbers changed, so they gave the killed virus shot, first, to protect against the live virus vaccine, given after, for a bunch of years, before it was deemed safe to stop using the live virus vaccine in the US.   \n\nYou have to keep looking at the biological norm, what we have now, and what we can get next, and see if\nthe new fixes what wasn\u2019t working, without causing more troubles, while being honest about each of them.

The study authors looked at injuries that could have been prevented by a crib bumper and found mostly minor injuries like bruises. Although there were some cases of broken bones caused by a baby\u2019s arm or leg getting caught between crib slats, the study authors stated that a crib bumper wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent those injuries. They recommended that crib bumpers never be used.\n\nIn 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) expanded its safe sleep guidelines to recommend that parents never use crib bumpers. Based on the 2007 study, the AAP stated: \u201cThere is no evidence that bumper pads prevent injuries, and there is a potential risk of suffocation, strangulation, or entrapment.\u201d", "Whacking their head is preferable to suffocating.

The concern was more so that the baby would get an arm or leg stuck in one of the openings and get hurt. \n\nKeep in mind that more modern cribs and mattress form a more tight fit to protect the baby.
