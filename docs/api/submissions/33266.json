One of my brothers Marcus (29m) got married to Lilith (28f) a six year ago back. They lived away from here so I didn't know her that well until they moved back here a bit over a year ago. I was really happy at first to have my brother around more but that happiness didn't last long. \n\nIt started with Lilith referring to me as \"it.\" I told her she can use \"she\" or \"they\" for me but \"it\" makes me uncomfortable and she apologized.  Then she did it another time and when I corrected her she said it was \"just a joke.\" I told her that it wasn't funny and not to do it. A while after that I was having a hard time and needed to leave bowling early and I heard Lilith say to Marcus as I was leaving \"don't feel bad, it isn't your fault its restarted.\" If you don't know \"restarted\" is a variation of the slur r\\*tarded. \n\nI was upset and talked to Marcus a couple days later and told me she was just joking. I told him that it really bothered me and he said he would talk to her. \n\nFast forward a bit, and my fiance Shawn (28m) shows me about a conversation he had with Lilith over text. She had basically insinuated that he has a k\\*nk for r\\*tarded girls and that he did a good job finding such a pretty one who can't think but must be nice in other ways. Shawn was very upset that she had said this and so was I. I tried to talk to Marcus but he just told me that Lilith has a dark sense of humor and that she didn't mean to upset anyone. I felt hurt by this still. So, when we made invites we didn't include Marcus or Lilith. When they asked about it I just explained why I chose what I did. They were livid. \n\nNow, all of my family is saying that if I don't let Marcus and Lilith come they won't.

I would not give in to their threats- who would even want these people at their wedding who would not defend their daughter/sibling and excuses their name calling? You would be better off in my opinion.", "Wait you are 19 and your fiance 28?", "'jokes' that are hurtful, especially when after being told more than once how they make you feel are NOT jokes, they are intentional cruelty.\n\nShe is horrible.

Your response is appropriate and you shouldn't have to be around someone like that on any day, let alone your wedding day.\n\nThat said, I would like to express some concern for you. Shawn may be a wonderful man who will make a great life partner, but in general, adult men who date and marry teenage women are... Problematic. The age gap tends to create a power imbalance because the young woman hasn't had much life experience, so she's forced to accept that her older husband knows better -- which allows him to set a lot of expectations and those expectations often favor the older man over his young wife. There's also a question of why a man is not dating someone nearer to his own age; with a problematic older man, it's often because women his age hold him accountable for his behavior and don't let him control the relationship (or he's fixated on women of a certain age and once his current partner reaches a set age, he moves on to a younger woman -- think Leo DiCaprio). \n\nOn top of this age disparity, you're now dealing with drama and a lack of support from your own family. While they do sound toxic to me, if you wind up low or no contact with them and things take a bad turn in your marriage, you may not have a support network if you eventually need it. Isolation from others can make it easier for an abuser and harder for the person they're abusing to get help. I hope you have friends or extended family who will be your support network in the future.\n\nAgain, I know absolutely nothing about Shawn except what you've said here. He may be a great guy, a wonderful husband, and happy to be your champion against people who would do you wrong. But please don't go into marriage blindly. You sound like a kind, intelligent, lovely person and you deserve to be with people who see your value and build you up. I hope this describes Shawn. I wish it also described your family. \n\nKnow your worth and be willing to keep demanding that people treat you well no matter who they are.\n\nBest wishes for a happy life filled with love.", "Nta.

That's definitely not good", "At 19 I was already married and it was exactly what I wanted, and if I could go back I would do it again.\n\nSource: Was 19 a long time ago", "Sure, but US residents are the majority of Reddit users and there's no other indication based on spelling or language that OP isn't in the US.

I lived something very similar- it\u2019s a common way to get into abusive relationships. Often, the abusive partner isn\u2019t the person\u2019s first (or worst) abuser- the family is.", "Yeah, I\u2019m fine with that. It was the insinuation that she\u2019s somehow a child, not a young new adult that bothered me. Like she\u2019s automatically not *really* as competent as any other 19 year old because she\u2019s autistic.", "I am hoping for the best for OP too, and I truly do hope her fianc\u00e9 is a good man. I just really hate any kind of predatory behaviour, especially when a more experienced person takes advantage of someone in a vulnerable position (due to age, environment, etc)", "Has absolutely nothing to do with \u2018wokeness\u2019, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re just of different backgrounds and mindsets but no need for apologies. Be well!", "Ok and in 10 years she\u2019ll be 29 and he\u2019ll be 38, and that doesn\u2019t sound so bad right? It doesn\u2019t, but that\u2019s not the point. She is 19 now. And the bigger issue is they\u2019re already engaged, so at best he was 27/26 and dating a 18/17 year old. As another Redditor said, no healthy and mature 28 year old would be interested in dating teenagers.", "Nope. Alot of people agree with me. Its a bit weird why a 28 y/o can\u2019t seem to find someone to date him around his age.", "you speak with a great deal of certainty for someone who has no idea what goes on behind closed doors.", "I wouldn't say automatic. Just concerning. It's concerning your boss went after someone barely legal first of all. \n\nAlso, grooming is a thing. So is controlling. So is Stockholm. \n\nMature as heck? Based on what? \n\nI mean I'm just saying as much as you're saying it isn't auto bad? This one instance probably isn't what it seems. \n\n34 and and 18 is disgusting. I don't care how mature she is. \n\nMy cousin got married to a man who was 50. But she was 26. Much different world.", "Divorce is expensive, inconvenient and very hard on the mentality. ESPECIALLY if there are children involved. People want to marry for life, so this mentality is not bad at all.", "Oh whelp gosh! Your anecdotal evidence sure showed me! And, yes - my general comment regarding the statistical favourablity about divorce rates going down the older couples get, was in fact both a personal attack on your marriage, stranger on the internet, and an overall judgment on divorced people in general. And I would have got away with it too, if you hadn't have come along to show me what's what.", "Congrats, your first aunt came from a generation where the patriarchal practice of marrying women off when they were still teenagers was more normalized. Doesn\u2019t mean it was ok.\n\nAs far as your other aunt 25 is a more normal age to get married.", "Nice anecdote", "And that is great for her, but also not the case for everyone.", "False. Him having a disability as well could also further make this an ick situation. Just because she has autism doesn't mean she isn't capable of having healthy relationships. If he has some disability that makes it so he cannot then she would be taking advantage of him. So how is that less icky?\n\nOdd that you're attempting to call me out yet assuming things about disabilities yourself.", "Hey there! Someone\u2019s who\u2019s autistic, adhd, and neurodivergent in other ways. You clearly are allistic and if not, have a shit ton of internalized ableism to work through. What you are saying in all your comments is incredibly ableist, infantilizing, and ngl predatory. Work through that, please. I\u2019m very tired of dealing with closed minded allistics like OPs SIL and you.\n\nAlso fyi, it\u2019s not people with autism. It\u2019s autistics. Language like that is incredibly ableist as it\u2019s pushed by organizations like Autism Speaks to try and separate us from our disability and encourage ignoring it. We\u2019re autistic, not people with autism.", "It makes it far less \"ick\" if so. \n\nI don't even think it's \"ick\" to begin with bc I don't know these people.", "You yourself are making an assumption that her actual disability is less severe than his potential one. \n\n\u201cNo two people with autism are the same\u201d yeah no shit; I have autism but thanks for your input", "Presumably weren\u2019t making the extra cash they\u2019d hoped for with them so discontinued them.", "Last September for no good reason.", "There are awards but I'm only able to access them on the mildly infuriating sub for some reason.

Is there automatically nefarious intent.... NO. Does the age, power, income dynamic as well as the fact that at 19 most people don't know themselves very well and are not fully in tune with what they want raising concerns. Absolutely. \n\nMy honest advice to OP would be just to slow down. See where things go. Develop yourself, your interests, your personality, your friendship circle, your education. Earn your own money. Be a couple. Have fun together. Don't start a family. If at 25 when he is 35 things are fantastic get married with a decade of income and life lived in the adult world behind you. Have a MASSIVE blowout. But don't rush life is long and you are young.", "I'm glad that worked out so well for you!  What's the age gap between you and your spouse?", "To someone almost a decade older than you?", "I would say it's more a concern that she was recently a child and he has been an adult for a long time. Something's not right here.", "I agree to that completely. I hope for the best, but brace for the worst.", "Not disagreeing with that, but you don't need to try round up his age to try make it look worse, it already looks bad enough", "What do you mean? Also love your name! Great mass effect one.", "That's what it was and had nothing to do with them meeting their life partners \ud83d\ude44", "Thanks I think \ud83e\udd14", "I didn\u2019t say she isn\u2019t capable of having healthy relationships you did due to the age difference? Just because he might have a disability also doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not capable of having healthy relationships does it? You are assuming that he\u2019s taking advantage of her and you don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m not assuming though because you are assuming his disability makes it worse! I have relatives and have worked with people who have autism and they are not unable to make sensible decisions", "Well then why don\u2019t you understand?", "Who in the world is going to pay fifty effing dollars for an award? \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "\"I don't want to have a child go through that\"\n\nYou're a much better person than they are.\n\nNTA and I hope you have a lovely wedding without all those toxic clowns.", "Oh gah! You're probably right about that.\n\nShe gets off on abusing OP.\n\nA wedding would totally be a thing she'd enjoy ruining.\n\nOP, I know it will feel really painful thinking of not having the family you want at your wedding. \n\nBut you will have a much better day if they aren't there treating you like crap or letting your SIL do it.", "Well,the most likely outcome is that the aunts won't even ask her.

That\u2019s what the commenter pointed out. Anyone who doesn\u2019t see something wrong with a 19 year old who is ready to tie herself to a 29 year old for life is almost definitely a) that young themselves and so just cannot understand, or b) one of the older (predatory) male variety", "Everything is relative bro. A 60 year old may see a 30 year old as a child to them.", "our brain is still developing at the age of 19, and doesn\u2019t stop until like mid 20\u2019s. yeah maybe \u2018legally\u2019 a 19 year old isn\u2019t a child, but a 19 year old mentally is closer to a child then to a 28 year old adult.", "At this point it's gross enough that a year or two doesn't really change things much in either direction. A late-20s person was dating a kid of 18 or younger... and she's got challenges. That's ... problematic. Argue all you like, there's no way to make this not problematic. (And supporting it is also giving the appearance of problematic.)", "It's roughly the same as the OP", "Yes", "Also why is he texting with his SIL?", "To be fair I said \u201cnearing thirty\u201d which 28 is. I was also speaking more generally. Mature people who are nearly 30 normally don\u2019t want to date teenagers.", "what I mean is that abusers in age gap relationships are extremely good at hiding their abuse in public settings. it's entirely possible that these relationships were healthy, but I would be cautious to state it as a fact that nothing was happening unless you are privy to what goes on in private. of course, I do fully understand that's a pessimistic view point that also could be seen as opening pandora's box, as it can technically be applied to all relationships, but when it comes to large age gap relationships, I feel it's best not to speak with 100% certainty. especially when one party was in their late teens very early twenties at the start", "Yes, that\u2019s usually what that was.

Your relatives marriage doesn't really matter, because it's just one example out of millions. The overall data shows that young marriages don't last and are filled with abuse.", "That people with impairments might act younger? Oh no I understand that. I don\u2019t understand why you aren\u2019t applying the logic equally to both people", "Very true", "I'm not supporting anything, I've already said it's weird, but you don't need to try make him look older for it to be weird, it's already weird", "But why try to make it sound worse, when you can just say a 28 Yr old, as you said in 10 years time nobody would have batter an eyelid,", "Actually, it was 2 different aunties but ok, just proving a point that it does work", "I don\u2019t have to apply to them both because that\u2019s not logical", "There is absolutely no need for you to split hairs on this unless you are trying to argue that Shawn is not creepy for preying on a teenager.", "As I just said, \u201cThere is something concerning about someone nearing thirty dating or marrying a teenager\u201d in general.

Why are you getting so fussed over a small detail?", "Unless it's a few hundred thousand aunties, then it doesn't matter. I got an uncle who swears he is Napoleon, doesn't make it true. \n\nAgain the individual components don't matter, you need to look at more marriages, a lot more, like thousands more.\n\nThe overall data shows it doesn't work, and it usually is harmful to women more often than men.", "So\u2026 she should act her age but he is allowed to act younger?
