One of my brothers Marcus (29m) got married to Lilith (28f) a six year ago back. They lived away from here so I didn't know her that well until they moved back here a bit over a year ago. I was really happy at first to have my brother around more but that happiness didn't last long. \n\nIt started with Lilith referring to me as \"it.\" I told her she can use \"she\" or \"they\" for me but \"it\" makes me uncomfortable and she apologized.  Then she did it another time and when I corrected her she said it was \"just a joke.\" I told her that it wasn't funny and not to do it. A while after that I was having a hard time and needed to leave bowling early and I heard Lilith say to Marcus as I was leaving \"don't feel bad, it isn't your fault its restarted.\" If you don't know \"restarted\" is a variation of the slur r\\*tarded. \n\nI was upset and talked to Marcus a couple days later and told me she was just joking. I told him that it really bothered me and he said he would talk to her. \n\nFast forward a bit, and my fiance Shawn (28m) shows me about a conversation he had with Lilith over text. She had basically insinuated that he has a k\\*nk for r\\*tarded girls and that he did a good job finding such a pretty one who can't think but must be nice in other ways. Shawn was very upset that she had said this and so was I. I tried to talk to Marcus but he just told me that Lilith has a dark sense of humor and that she didn't mean to upset anyone. I felt hurt by this still. So, when we made invites we didn't include Marcus or Lilith. When they asked about it I just explained why I chose what I did. They were livid. \n\nNow, all of my family is saying that if I don't let Marcus and Lilith come they won't.

I would not give in to their threats- who would even want these people at their wedding who would not defend their daughter/sibling and excuses their name calling? You would be better off in my opinion.", "Wait you are 19 and your fiance 28?", "'jokes' that are hurtful, especially when after being told more than once how they make you feel are NOT jokes, they are intentional cruelty.\n\nShe is horrible.

Your response is appropriate and you shouldn't have to be around someone like that on any day, let alone your wedding day.\n\nThat said, I would like to express some concern for you. Shawn may be a wonderful man who will make a great life partner, but in general, adult men who date and marry teenage women are... Problematic. The age gap tends to create a power imbalance because the young woman hasn't had much life experience, so she's forced to accept that her older husband knows better -- which allows him to set a lot of expectations and those expectations often favor the older man over his young wife. There's also a question of why a man is not dating someone nearer to his own age; with a problematic older man, it's often because women his age hold him accountable for his behavior and don't let him control the relationship (or he's fixated on women of a certain age and once his current partner reaches a set age, he moves on to a younger woman -- think Leo DiCaprio). \n\nOn top of this age disparity, you're now dealing with drama and a lack of support from your own family. While they do sound toxic to me, if you wind up low or no contact with them and things take a bad turn in your marriage, you may not have a support network if you eventually need it. Isolation from others can make it easier for an abuser and harder for the person they're abusing to get help. I hope you have friends or extended family who will be your support network in the future.\n\nAgain, I know absolutely nothing about Shawn except what you've said here. He may be a great guy, a wonderful husband, and happy to be your champion against people who would do you wrong. But please don't go into marriage blindly. You sound like a kind, intelligent, lovely person and you deserve to be with people who see your value and build you up. I hope this describes Shawn. I wish it also described your family. \n\nKnow your worth and be willing to keep demanding that people treat you well no matter who they are.\n\nBest wishes for a happy life filled with love.", "Nta.

Go NC with your family they are the real assholes here.", "You are AMAZING as you are and if your family can't see that, then it's their loss.\n\nI don't think your family is acting in your best interest, please don't invite that thing that is being rude to you", "Tell them it's a joke", "Fight fire with fire. Treat her like she treats you and just say \"it's just a joke\"", "Oh! I didn't even think of that! I was scrolling while considering the ages because at first I obviously noticed the whole \"getting married at 19\" thing which. Mh. Well she is an adult and I'm pretty sure that's around the age my parents got married at too. Yknow. Some people do know what they want in life pretty early on. Then I noticed the age gap and. Oof. Generally I'm indifferent towards bigger gaps in age as long as both people are over 25/26. But this one is obviously very very far from that. I'd already be kind of concerned if the guy was 25. But then THIS! THEYRE ALREADY ENGAGED. That means that either he was already dating her when she was underage or they got engaged super quick within like one year of dating, which with her being a young adult is just as fucked up.", "Your parent\u2019s relationship is anecdotal & irrelevant to the point here. I\u2019m assuming & glad they seemingly worked out based on your response but c\u2019mon\u2026\nAt 19, you should not be dating (much less engaged to) someone 8 years your senior. It\u2019s predatory no matter how \u201cmature\u201d or \u201cbeyond their years\u201d OP or any individual is at that age. Do you disagree?", "Was she barely legal when they got married? Yeah, he probably was.", "There is something concerning about someone nearing thirty dating or marrying a teenager.  I\u2019m sure there are exceptions, but most times that behaviour is pretty predatory or abusive.\n\nRecommending she wait a few years rather than rushing into marriage at 19 is sound advice, and they raise a good point - how old were they when they started dating if they\u2019re getting married at 19 and 28?", "Sorry but he was. There's enough people in the world that everyone can and should date their own age or close to it. It's not bigotry to think it's weird and wrong to date someone a full fucking decade younger than you.", "The age gap is a little weird. They arent saying anyone is abusive.. they are saying its a bit weird. And yes in current modern times 19&28 is weird", "If she was a teenager when they started dating, then most likely he was. Yes.", "Do NOT marry this person, and at 28 you\u2019ll be able to look back and wonder what on earth was wrong with that man that he could look at a 19 year old and not see a child.", "Setting aside how inappropriately it was expressed, any half-decent sibling would be concerned about their teenaged sibling marrying someone who is almost 30.", "Oh I thought I read wrong", "Uh, yeah, he's definitely an AH. Ask him to explain the joke.", "NTA. It\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s cruel. Ask your brother how he would feel if someone used the slurs on his wife or children. I bet he won\u2019t be amused", "Value judgement.  Sorry I'm not as woke as you.", "nope, you didn't"]}
