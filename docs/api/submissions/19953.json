{"id": 19953, "submission_id": "14ca9fv", "title": "AITA for letting my team member leave shift because his friend died?", "selftext": "I feel stupid for asking this but I need an outside perspective of someone who wasn't affected and biased. \n\nI run an overnight stocking team at a grocery store. On any given load night we have four or five people scheduled. This shift we had our second biggest load of the week normally requiring 5 people and with Father's day tomorrow we had a lot to do. \n\nFifteen minutes before the final two people were scheduled to be there one called out saying they didn't feel good. It's a whole separate issue but I knew once I saw their text there was no way they would respond if I asked them to try and work. This isn't exactly their first time doing this. (I've discussed this with my higher-ups)\n\nAt 11 my final guy came in and looked terrible. Honestly he could barely talk. Turned out he got a call LITERALLY minutes before he was to wake up for his shift that a childhood friend had died. He hasn't been working with me very long. I think he may still be on 90 day probation but he is a good guy and a great worker. He already had to work several weeks ago the day his pet died that ment the world to him. \n\nSo I talked to him and I told him that his well being came first. Shared a few stories about my personal experiences (we did the same with his cat and he said it helped last time) and helped him check his sick pay to see if he could at the least use them to get paid and go home. I don't know anything about bereavement pay and we couldn't ask this late at night. \n\nHere's where I might have messed up. I forgot we had a district manager walk the next morning. Witch ment not only did we not have enough people to finish load but it needed completed and top notch presentation by the time I leave in the morning. The cashier actually reminded me just after he left and I honestly felt a pit in my stomach. I knew letting him go would cause a massive hiccup but I decided to not call him and ask him to come back. I did try to call the other one but like I said I knew they wouldn't pick up.\n\nI did however call my manager who would have come in at maybe 4-6am with the issue and made a quick plan the admittedly required us holding off on stocking a bit and redirecting team members. I will give her credit, she decided to come in straight away and help. That was massively appreciated.\n\nThankfully we did have additional people coming in that aren't directly on my team but have enough experience that they could help, but it ment they would be pulled from their original workload to prep for the walk.\n\nAll in all I don't regret letting him leave but every higher up didn't seem that compassionate about his situation. Heck the GM straight up said he should have stayed and that we all loose friends. This isn't uncommon sadly and I do stand my ground a bit but I know there is no changing their minds.

While forgetting about the walk is a big mistake, and I would have come up with a contingency plan beforehand, I can't really fault you for simply having forgotten something.  \n\nHOWEVER - a lesson I would take from this is to maybe corroborate the story? Alternatively it's probably a good idea if you're in charge of a team to be aware of corporate policies about bereavement leave and what qualifies. My company has very specific rules about which type of relation gets bereavement leave, and how long. And we usually require the employee to provide an obituary of some sort to prove that the person did actually die. Is it a fool proof method? No. But it has deterred a lot of fraudulent claims.", "NTA", "NTA - Your coworker was in no condition to work, the way you describe the way he looked and talked when he came in.

He simply would not have been able to concentrate and there might be a bigger mess to fix.\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nNow the other two employees... if this is a common occurrence... well you need to look at their employment contract as they may be the ones that need to be replaced.\n\nThe GM has no empathy.
