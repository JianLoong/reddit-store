This week my middle sister \"Emily\" asked if she could come over as she's having a tough week. Not sure if this is important but Emily doesn't work, she lives with our other sister \"Stacey\", her husband and their son. I'll be honest I was a bit annoyed by her saying she's had a tough week when she doesn't really do anything. When she asked to come over I told her it would have to be this weekend as I work full-time. She was okay with that. \n\nYesterday I got a knock from the door and it was a supermarket delivery guy saying he's got a delivery with my name on it. I found out my sister still had my card details and ordered \u00a330.00 worth of food shopping for whilst she's here and she said she would pay me back Wednesday this week when she got paid. I did accept the delivery and I phoned her after saying I either didn't know or forgot you had my card details and you ordered stuff without my permission and that's not okay; if you asked I would have said yes. Because of this I reported my card as lost and decided to print six months worth of bank statements and I trippled checked every payment and so far this is the only payment I know she made as I'm the type of person who will keep receipts for a period of six months. \n\nThis morning I came down to my kitchen being an absolute mess. She didn't bother emptying her dinner, she left food wrappers on the counter and half filled Dr pepper cans on the sink. It took me five minutes to fill up one bin bag and then not even three minutes to wash her plate and clean it. \n\nI went in the room and I said I just spent five minutes filling one whole bin bag with your rubbish and cleaning the kitchen because of the state you left it in. I saw the rubbish in her bedroom too. There's Dr pepper cans and empty crisps packets and so on. I asked her if she could clean her mess up. This is where I lost it! She replied \"I can't clean you out can I?\"  I shouted at her for the disrespect and I had ago and made it well-known just how lazy she is. \n\nFive minutes after I slammed the door and walked away our sister called me and told me I'm completely an asshole for what I did and had ago at me for having ago at her. Our parents are both dead but if you're thinking she's entitled and spoiled I agree. \n\nI can't wait for her to go home tomorrow. I feel I may be the asshole here because I don't usually loose it easily and they way I shouted at her she looked like she was going to cry. I may be the asshole as I could have handled it better. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692451913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vge5o/aita_for_calling_my_sister_lazy/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How does a  having a \"rough week\" translate in needing to stay with you?  Sounds like your other sister is having problems with her and perhaps they had a blow out?\nMaybe she was also stealing from them?", "NTA. Send her home yesterday.", "Change your locks and passwords", "NTA - Your sister sounds like an insufferable chore.", "She\u2019s a mess. No more allowing her to come over as she\u2019s proven to be a terrible house guest. Tell her so and that you wish she get help for whatever is keeping her from being a productive and well adjusted adult.", "NTA - yes, you got disregulated and said something mean to someone who probably has some mental health issues. But I think most people in that moment would have lost it. Time to set some really clear boundaries with your sister. No more multi-day visits. No more covering things where she has to pay you back later. People who hate boundaries are the ones who need them most. I had a similar sibling and it was very challenging, but you\u2019ve got this!", "NTA for being mad at your sister, it sounds like you two aren't well suited to live together at the moment. Boundaries like clean up your dishes and don't use my money without permission are good!\n\nStill, I wonder what is going on here. It doesn't sound like your sister is well within herself. When people don't work and won't clean like that generally their mental health is very poor, or they have other problems with addiction or possibly a disability of some sort. Does any of that apply here?", "I'm going against the grain here and saying ESH. She obviously should not have used your card without asking and been more respectful of your home, but you went into this with a hair trigger. You clearly didn't want her there, and instead of communicating that, you waited until she did something you didn't like and exploded all over her. It honestly sounds like you have a lot of resentment about her life choices. Yelling is not a productive form of communication and if you actually want to improve your relationship with your sister you could reach out and discuss her life plans and come up with a plan to help get her back on track to becoming more independent. It sounds like she is depressed.", "Is she on the spectrum? I have many family members who are\u2014they\u2019re amazing humans but needed guidance in seeing beyond themselves when they were young. It\u2019s just learned rather than innate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Anyine who doesn't work is by definition lazy. Anyine who leaves trash around a house and doesn't clean up is lazy. I'm surprised she hasn't heard the same thing from the sister she lives with and your parents. So now you know to never invite her again. Lesson learned.", "NTA. Wear what you like whenever you like, just not a white dress to someone else's wedding (which you clearly understand). Also, neither you nor your husband should attend the wedding if she insists on treating you as such. You don't need that drama in your life.", "Yes you could have handled it better, and she could have as well.  Next time she asks to come over, maybe you can establish some ground rules.  Not leaving a mess in the kitchen or living room and keeping her room picked up--for starters.  Also, not using your card or having stuff delivered to your house without your prior permission.  ESH", "NTA. She stole your card, left your place a mess and you're the ah? I don't think so. She needs a reality check. Does she even have a full time job or does she just couch surf and complain?", "I came in to check on her and she's flat out asleep even though it's 3pm. I checked with my sister they haven't had any problems with her. They said she's had a rough week because their one-year-old son has been crying throughout the nights this week and it's been keeping our sister awake causing to have a rough week but our sister said she's still getting 8 hours a sleep a day.", "Thank you, I didn't think of that, and I'm currently in the middle of changing my locks and passwords. To be sure, I'm also going through any personal information to make sure there's nothing that shouldn't be there.", "NTA and let her know you won't have her over again if she can't respect your house. Actions and consequences.", "Why didn't you just kick her out? Why are you waiting for tomorrow? The girl is lazy AF and made a pigsty of your house.

It's not uncommon in the UK for longer term benefit claimants to refer to getting paid or payday when referring to their benefits.", "NTA\n\nSounds like sis is lazy to me.  She knows it, which is why she is defensive.\n\nGood for changing your card, she doesn\u2019t need access to it.   \nFrom now on, she doesn\u2019t need to stay at your home since she doesn\u2019t respect it.", "NTA", "NTA - she is lazy", "That's probably reaching but maybe she's depressed? \n\nShe's having a tough time\n\nNo energy to clean up after herself\n\nWas about to cry after you berated her for not cleaning up\n\nOr she's just lazy.", "NTA - Using your card without your permission is not ok. \nShe sounds very unorganised, in herself and her behaviours. It seems very entitled with her response. She failed to take any responsibility. It may have been a joke, but not ok. \nMaybe helping her here would be a start, offering some advice on how to improve life. Your other sister should help here too. \n\nIt could have been communicated better, true - but I would have totally lost it too. It happens to us all, it doesn\u2019t make you an AH, just frustrated. Sit here down and have a chat, see how it goes.", "NTA - but I think people are being a little harsh saying you should kick her out and calling her a thief. At the end of the day she\u2019s still your sister, and you still have a chance to handle the situation differently. \nMaybe you should try sitting her down and having an open conversation about her behaviour and try and get to know if there\u2019s something bother her?", "FYI Not 'everybody' who doesn't work is lazy thats an ableist overgeneralisation.", "Who pays her on Wednesdays?", "Don't forget not to spend my money without my knowledge or permission!"]}
