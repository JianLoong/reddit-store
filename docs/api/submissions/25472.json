English is not my first language.\n\n  \nFirst of all, a little background: I've (24F) been together with my boyfriend (24M) for 3 years and we live together in a 1 bedroom apartment. \n\n  \nHis 17-year-old brother lives with their parents in their hometown. I've always had a good relationship with his brother, who looked up to us. \n\n  \nNow, to the story:\n\n  \nRecently, there was a 5-day music festival in my town. The brother asked if he and some friends could crash in our living room during the festival. We agreed as long as they didn't disrupt our normal activities, as we had work in the mornings and preferred the house to ourselves in the afternoons. They promised to only come to sleep and they would spend most of their time at the festival. This was the only reason I agreed to the deal.\n\n  \nDuring the week of the festival, he and his friends spent literally the entire day at home. They left to go to the festival around 9pm each day and came home around 4am. We were both annoyed by this - we need to pass through the living room to go to the balcony to smoke, and the bathroom was constantly occupied (often for an hour at a time) since we only have one. \n\n  \nI was hinting towards the fact that they should be doing the daytime activities at the festival (there are plenty), but they said they don't want to. I was getting more and more frustrated and wanted to confront them directly, but my boyfriend said I can't (I did have issues with expressing my anger in the past, so he was worried I would come off as too aggressive if I said something). I asked him to talk to his brother then, but he refused. \n\n  \nOne day, the bathtub was filled with hair and the whole bathroom was covered with a massive puddle. My boyfriend explained to them that they should use the shower curtains when showering, because the water from the floor flows under the bathtub (bad construction) and leaks, flooding the downstairs neighbour.\n\n  \nThe next day, when I go to shower, the bathroom is really badly flooded again. I yelled out \"We told you we have a shower curtain, so please f\\*cking use it instead of flooding the entire bathroom\". I accidentally slammed the door (open windows and it was windy, but I'm also well aware that no one would believe me that it was accidental, so I'll take the blame for it). For the remainder of their stay, I was trying to avoid them and said some passive aggressive remarks when I had to wait for the bathroom. \n\n  \nThe morning after they left, I received a long text from his brother calling me an awful host, telling me that I made his friends feel unwelcome. He told me he never wants to see me again and that he feels ashamed in front of his friends now. \n\n  \nMy boyfriend got a call from his mom and she said that his brother has been saying awful things about me to the whole family. He did defend me, but he still thinks I'm the asshole. I'd love to get some outside perspective on this! \n\nEdit to add some things that didn't fit in the original post due to length:\n\n- We did ask them to pay a small amount of money (think 10 dollars for the entire 5 days) to cover the utilities. Obviously we made no profit of this, but I thought I'd add in case it changes the judgements.\n\n- They weren't loud or disrespectful, that's why my boyfriend was against talking to them. The main issue was the fact that they stayed in all day and we couldn't use the bathroom and living spaces normally. And the shower issue.\n\n- I wasn't unwelcoming at the beginning, had small talk with them and even invited them out with our friends (they declined). However, it kinda bugged me that they never even introduced themselves, nor did my bf's brother introduce them. It felt like the small talk was one sided, so I didn't try much.\n\n- His mom didn't accuse me of anything! She called my bf to tell him that his brother has been saying awful things about me and to get our perspective, as she didn't think I would do that without a reason. His brother has been acting out lately and had conflicts with many family members (due to his entitled behaviour if you ask me), so his mum knew she was not getting the whole story from him.", "created_utc": 1692962200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160wbc0/aita_for_making_our_guests_feel_unwelcome/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not for yelling, not for anything you *did* do, but for what you *didn't* do. I see no examples of any courtesy or graciousness on your part, no small talk, no demanding they eat or drink something, and certainly nothing in the way of an apology or sending them off warmly after your angry outburst. You basically offered your home on the condition that you be left alone. The result of that was, every bit of tension you felt, they felt as well. If you are hosting someone in your home, you should, within the bounds of your personality, do or say things to show you want it to be easier for them.", "ESH You did not want them there in the first place so you should have declined.\n\nThey should not have behaved in that way.

The odds of this ending anything other than badly were negligible.", "That's a really great saying haha! I wish we had that in my language.\n\nTo his mom's defense, she didn't say she blamed me for the situation, just called my BF to inform him and ask him of our perspective. We have a good relationship and I think she did a great job raising my bf, but his brother is just having the bratty teen phase most probably.", "His upbringing was focused on keeping the peace with your loved ones and we've had conflicts in the past because of this. I do believe that his parents did a good job raising them, as he is a great boyfriend in every other aspect. However, we did have conflicts in the past because of his unwillingness to engage in confrontation. I'm the opposite, I don't mind conflict, but I have a bad temper and we got into fights when I couldn't control my mouth in certain situations. I have been actively trying to work on this, and it has become much less frequent that I cause unnecessary drama. I have been asking him to meet me halfway and if he thinks I would be too rude addressing an issue, he should address it in his own way. He doesn't like this, as this puts the responsibility of \"being the bad guy\" on him.", "Well, he said to suck it up and say nothing because it's just 5 days. He's really not a fan of confrontation. But during those 5 days they were there, he active complained to our friends about their behaviour, so he was clearly bothered too. He just thought it's better to keep the peace, because it's just a couple of days and we wouldn't let them stay again.", "Thank you for your input! This is probably the issue - I did not want them there. I only agreed because I felt pressured by his family (his parents brought it up before him and I felt saying no would disappoint them). I should have said no. However, we clearly stated that we would not be hosting them as guests in the traditional sense - we would be busy, so we wouldn't provide food or anything, especially because they were practically strangers (except for his brother). We would be letting them sleep in our living room - period. In the first 2 days, I did try to make small talk, even invited them to join us when we went out with our friends. I only stopped after the conflict with the bathroom flooding. I think you're right in saying I should have done more since despite my reluctance I agreed to hosting them. I guess my frustration got the better of me.", "And now that ungrateful b****** of brother is badmouthing you in front the family. So much for keeping the peace. Your bf should consider growing a spine.", "This is why just suck it up never works.\n\nTour bf needs therapy.", "I'm sorry you had guests who invites themselves to your house.\n\nWhy that entitles them to be hosted by you is beyond me.  They were not there to see you or hang out with your family.  They wanted free lodging.  That is pretty clear.  The problem is they used that as an excuse to treat your home like a hotel.\n\nIf anything,  they should have been doing things for you.  Bought some kind of thank you trinket. They didn't do that.\n\n\nDon't buy into this notion that you have to roll out the red carpet for people who want to use you as a free hotel.", "Dump this whole family, they're awful!!", "NTA. You really should have thought it through before allowing them to stay.", "NTA.  An awful guest creates an awful host.  They were rude, inconsiderate and were not upfront with their plans.", "My mom.always said that!", "Probably the best conclusion. Lesson learned!", "You know, I really don't think you even have anger issues.

Sounds like the timings were never gonna work since the festival is at night but u assumed  they\u2019d be out during the morning and afternoon too did they have a key? Your bathroom is an issue that needs to be fixed not avoided. If ur bf says he doesn\u2019t want to address the issues u feel u have with his brother you should have either said u are going to yourself or agree to get thru the week and not let them stay over again \u2026 ur behaviour ended up being overly rude. Also wtf $10 lol", "NTA they sound like terrible entitled guests and I would have kicked them out and made them get a hotel room after the 1st day.", "NTA. Who the hell leaves the shower curtain open? Were his friends previously raised by a pack of wolves  and only showered under waterfalls? Did their parents make them stand outside under an overflowing gutter to bathe? Did they collectively have a traumatic 1960\u2019s Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho experience? Have they somehow never seen a shower curtain before??? Seriously.", "Thank you for the perspective! The festival had activities from 10am up until like 6am. Cultural and fun too. Obviously I didn't expect them to leave at 10am, in fact I thought they would he sleeping till noon-ish and then go to daytime activities like they said they would. They did have a key of course. We live in a rental and when we brought up the flooding issue to the landlord he bought a shower curtain which fixed the issue completely cause unless you're playing acrobat, no water gets on the floor. Sometimes we shower together with my bf and still don't get water outside the tub. So if you're considerate and using the curtain, there is  no issue. The $10 was to cover the water and gas used, as we aren't too well off and we felt it was reasonable. The camping access to the festival would have cost $20 and included access to put up your tent and use the port-a-potties and showers. They didn't want to go to the camping because that would have been inconvenient for them. That being said, I completely understand your point and accept your judgement!", "The festival had day and night activities. They chose not to go to day. Even though beforehand they said they would only be there to sleep. \n\nIts probably a rental and not gonna fix the bathroom."]}
