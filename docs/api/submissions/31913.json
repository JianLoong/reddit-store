The issue with this is I don't know these friends, he's being super vague about who they are and where they hang out. Feels like he's intentionally keeping me out of that loop. I don't know any names apart from Peter and apparently Bill? (fake names but similar)  \n\n\nWell this morning, he approached me and started demanding an apology for breaking the duck ornament. I reminded him that I had already apologised at the time (With a casual \"oh shit, sorry,\") but he insisted on a \"proper apology.\" I countered by stating that he wouldn't get one until he explained his weird as hell behaviour.

Don't get trapped in an abusive relationship.", "NTA - very shady behaviour and a huge red flag.", "You're not asking if you'd be the asshole for not apologizing; you're asking whether you'd be the asshole for getting an explanation for his explosive anger and seriously suspicious behaviour before you apologize. I disagree with the vote that says you'd be the asshole; I think that person missed the distinction here. You are NTA for wanting an explanation. Your boyfriend is an asshole for calling you a bitch instead of just having a conversation about it. However, the apology and the explanation are two different things, and maybe you should consider just apologizing so that he can't say you haven't done your part. Then you can worry about the remaining issue, which is his behaviour. His anger seems unjustified, but maybe he has a reason. His behaviour and deliberate vagueness is suspicious and upsetting. His insults are way out of line. Having said that, the \"why can't you just accept you've done something wrong\" statement is valid. Do you *need* an explanation of why it was important? Clearly it was, even if you don't think so\u2014otherwise he wouldn't have acted that way. You don't need to have an explanation of that to feel sorry about it. I understand that his anger took you off guard and would feel the same way myself, but clearly he did care about that ugly thing, so you should accept that and act accordingly.", "NTA but there is definitely something going on.  I won\u2019t go so far as saying he is cheating on you, and I\u2019m not at all defending his overreacting, but it\u2019s pretty clear the relationship is strained and he\u2019s done emotionally.   If you at all want to save it, ask if he\u2019d be open to couples counseling.  If he says no, honestly cut your losses and start the split process.  \n\nIt won\u2019t be easy any it\u2019ll hurt.  But it\u2019s better to part ways now because you want to than doing it later because you have to.", "NTA.  He needs to explain why this ornament is so important to him that it caused this level of reaction.  If he can't use his words or he says he would get equally upset if you broke anything of his, that is a tablecloth-sized \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9.", "There\u2019s got to be more going on here. I agree with other posts that you don\u2019t get to decide for him what\u2019s important. It also sounds like he\u2019s terrible at communicating his feelings. You both need to chill TF out and have a productive conversation to get to the bottom of why he lost his shit over a duck and why you aren\u2019t recognizing his feelings.", "NTA!  \n\n\nI mean, sure, your apology wasn't good and apparently duck is important to him. But that kind of reaction is out of the line, scary and SHOULD NEVER happen over a mistake.    \nIf I were you, I would offer sincere apology, but absolutely demand apology from him for lashing out.  \n\n\nAnd you are absolutely right to demand explanation, regardless if before or after your apology.", "ESH. His reaction is completely out of proportion, but is there a reason you seem so be doing everything in your power to not actually apologize? It doesn\u2019t really matter that the ugly ornament nothing to you, it clearly meant something to him, and you seem to be doing a lot to pretend it wasn\u2019t a big deal when it clearly is somewhat of a big deal", "Just got back online for a short time, Some context about the duck: it was given as a co-anniversary / b'day gift to him by a mutual friend who's a lesbian and her GF. Our anniversaries are one day apart so we share and his birthday is 6 days later. It was very much a gag-gift and they got us another gift along with it", "Hard to judge the situation is quite unclear\n\nMaybe you're just invalidating that the ornament really meant something to your BF. I mean it's not important if it's important to you or if the person gifted the ornament is important to you but whether the ornament or the person is actually important to your BF. Also the price is irrelevant. Christmas ornaments are sometimes pretty even if they are cheap. Maybe it's a symbol? You say it's a duck? Thats unusual for an ornament so maybe the duck meant someting. If it is that go say sorry and yes in that case you were in fact TA. \n\nThe other possibility is that it's not about the ornament or the person giving it to you/BF at all but your BF was triggered. It set off something unsettling. Christmas itself is triggering to many people. Not everyone has nice childhood Christmas memories. Many people mentally struggle at Christmas time. If it's that you should go and appologize and if it's that you indeed were TA. \n\nAnd last but not least your BF is in transition wants to break up and tries to gaslight you so you feel you messed up giving him an excuse to break up. In that case your BF is TA. \n\nWhatever the reason, talking things out usually sheds light on things. Being stubborn and not wanting to communicate openly is not helping here. \"shit, oh sorry\" is typically not a proper appology. Where I'm coming from there's this saying \"sorry is the little sister of don't make such a fuss\".", "Info: you are still on this relationship why?", "Well, you broke a gift from one of his friends, and just said \"oh shit, sorry\" which is a weak apology. You then say it wasnt anything fancy, and it meant nothing to you, as well as it being a gift from nobody important, clearly showing that you dont even know why your boyfriend is angry.\n\nA gift doesnt have to be fancy to be meaningful, a person doesnt have to be dead to be important, and it doesnt have to mean anything to you, for it to mean something for someone else.\n\nI cant say anything about his behaviour, but in the case of the broken ornament YTA", "You spent a good portion of the post justifying the fact that the ornament is worthless. You clearly give the same impression to your boyfriend who has a clear attachment to the ornament. It was his and he valued it. It doesn't matter if it cost 50 cents, it has sentimental value. Your reaction to breaking it was flippant, it was your reaction that upset him not the breaking of the ornament. You were sorry but it also wasn't a big deal to you. You made that clear. Buy him an ornament, and write an apology card recognizing that the ornament is not the same but \"it made me think of you and how much you mean to me\". He wants to know his feelings matter. YNTA but you are a tad insensitive to his obviously hurt feelings.", "You two have bigger problems than the ornament\u2026 Time to sit down and talk to learn what is happening.", "ESH\n\nThe blow up and being vague with you after is shitty for sure but \u201coh shit sorry\u201d can come off more like \u201coops\u201d. Y\u2019all def need to work on communicating feelings but don\u2019t hold an apology over his head to get to that conversation, that\u2019s not really an apology either. Just seems there\u2019s missteps in communication and respect here especially if the value of the duck was so surprising (and in a way the importance of who it\u2019s from), along with being secretive. Bottom line neither of y\u2019all are feeling respected but take it as an opportunity to work on things.\n\nGood luck!!", "YTA. \n\nI get the impression you don\u2019t sincerely apologise very often and may have trouble accepting blame even though you consider it an honest mistake. \n\nThat can grate on a person. \u201cSorry I broke your ornament, BUT it was cheap anyway.\u201d Is in no way an apology. You can\u2019t rationalise your mistake and apologise for it. \n\nAnd as for the \u2018Youre mad me? Well Im mad at you too\u201d scenario? That\u2019s kind of what leads me to believe you\u2019re not big on accountability or accepting blame. \u201cSure I broke your cheap ornament, but look at you and your secret friends?Im the aggrieved party here!\u201d", "YTA for not respecting that your boyfriend may have more of an attachment to a gift than you realized. Sentimental value is a thing. Genuinely apologize.", "Who needs a complicated apology for an accident.  You didn't do it on purpose.  \n\nNTA", "He\u2019s seeing someone else.  Sorry but that was the first thing that came to my mind when reading this.", "NTA\n\nLook, it's entirely possible that stupid old duck ornament meant something to him, something much more that you knew, and you broke it and it obviously didn't mean anything to you and he was upset by that.\n\nI'd still say his reaction was hugely over the top! But okay, maybe the duck had this huge secret sentimental value to him and the fact both that it's broken AND that it didn't really mean anything to you AND maybe it hit him at a really bad moment - I wouldn't say it  justified a massive explosion of rage, but maybe could *explain* it?\n\nBut he's a grown-up person who can use his words. You are fully justified in wanting him to explain why he went into this huge explosion of rape and stormed out because you accidentally broke the duck ornament.  And nothing explains why, (days?) after it happened, he's demanding a \"proper apology\" and calling you abusive names for breaking the duck ornament.\n\nI have possessions to which I am stupidly sentimentally attached that I would be really upset if someone broke them accidentally. And I might not be able to properly explain why I was so upset at the time. But - this has been at least one day, maybe more? If he's a grown-up human he can and he should explain to you what that stupid old duck ornament meant to him and why he was so upset it's broken, and then let you apologise meaningfully now you know why it upset him so much. And if he can't do that - if he's got no explanation why he went off his rocker at you and is still being verbally abusive (days?) later, well: you don't owe him an apology, because it sounds like he is just being verbally abusive because he likes to upset you, not because he ever cared about the duck.\n\nAs they say around here, the Iranian yoghurt is not the problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Where do you draw the line in abusive behaviour? \n\nLast Christmas I broke a small, crystal Christmas tree that my bf's mother got for him and he had for about 7 years, my robe just got mixed up in the branches and it fell down and shattered, ornaments broke, everything. They don't make that model anymore, and it wasn't cheap either, cost more than 150\u20ac. He laughed and moved on, joked about how clumsy I am and \"threatened\" to tell his mother so that she could scold me, all of that while laughing with my bright red face and my constant apologetic tone. \n\nThat's a normal reaction, even being a little upset and explaining that you should have apologized like you mean it would have been a normal reaction. \n\nWhat you are describing sounds like your relationship is heading towards a bad place, if he doesn't show actual remorse for his awful reaction.
