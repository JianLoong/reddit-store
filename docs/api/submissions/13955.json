We get home an hour difference as well.\n\nUsually we both need naps after work. This last few days though she\u2019ll take a \u201cnap\u201d that\u2019s basically the entire night into next morning. She\u2019ll get home around 6, says she needs a nap, then I don\u2019t hear from her again until the next morning.\n\nFirst day was whatever; she\u2019s tired. But it\u2019s been 12 (business) days in a row. I confronted her before about it and she dismissed it immediately saying she\u2019s just tired. No matter what I ask (is work stressful, are you feeling ok) she immediately says it\u2019s fine and to drop it.\n\nFor those days I have been doing all of the housework. Before we would split tasks 50-50 but now it\u2019s more like 99-1. Walking our dog, making dinner, cleaning the place, dishes, all that has been me. I wouldn\u2019t complain if there was a reason better than she\u2019s sleeping half the time.\n\nFriday she said she was gonna take a nap and I finally snapped and told her no. I\u2019ll admit I was aggressive but I had enough. I said I was sick of her constantly sleeping and leaving me with all the work while she refuses to consider anything is wrong. I said it blankly; we both look for help for her or she stops sleeping so much on her own. \n\nShe just turned around and left for her sisters. I got an angry call from her mom saying I have no right to deny her sleep. I tried to explain but she just hung up. My gf isn\u2019t responding to my messages and neither is her family.\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. Aita?\n\nEditing for some clarification:\n\n1. The possibility is there for her being pregnant or depressed. I would 100% be with her for both, however she dismissed the idea anything is wrong.\n\n2. I do her laundry and cook enough dinner for 2 in case she gets hungry when she wakes up. Last couple days I stopped because she never did get up. All the grocery shopping has been done by me as well.\n\n2.5: to those claiming I\u2019m mad because \u201cshe won\u2019t clean up after you\u201d that is not the case at all. I never expect her to clean up after me; I always take care of myself. We both work full time and both split the chores before; I at no point ever have nor ever will expect her to do all the housework. \n\n3. Weekends she does some minimal housework but mostly she sleeps in and watches tv. I\u2019m fine with that on weekends since I lounge around but with the weeks of her doing nothing it feels worse.\n\n4. I yelled; I admit I was angry but I never touched her. I finally reached my limit of her both sleeping so much and ignoring my concerns.\n\n5. To those saying I\u2019m a shit bf for not forcing her to the doctor, that\u2019s a crime. Plus if I tied her up and took her to the clinic how does that look? She\u2019s not a toddler I can\u2019t make her do anything.", "created_utc": 1680580282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12b88nt/aita_for_being_mad_my_26m_gf_27f_sleeps_out_of/", "score": 1245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's understandable that you're frustrated with the situation, but your approach was aggressive and confrontational. Your girlfriend has been consistently sleeping for longer periods of time, and instead of showing concern and trying to have a conversation about it, you demanded that she stop sleeping and seek help. Your girlfriend has been taking longer naps after work for the past 12 consecutive business days, but you haven't mentioned what happens on her days off or how many working days she has in a week.\n\nYou also seem to be dismissing her explanations for her behaviour and assuming that there must be something wrong with her. You mentioned that she dismissed your previous attempt to talk to her about it, but you didn't mention if you tried to have a more compassionate and understanding conversation with her.\n\nFurthermore, your decision to deny her the ability to take a nap was controlling; it's not your place to dictate when your girlfriend can or cannot take a nap.", "Firstly, if she goes to sleep after work till morning, why is cooking dinner and dishes her responsibility? Your dinner, your dishes.  But this is not normal. Being aggressive about her not contributing is missing the point. Another comment asked if she was pregnant. Could this be possible.

And Maybe she should get some bloodwork done?", "NTA\n\nEveryone telling OP skmethings wrong with her.. As if he would know. He asked and she dismissed it..

The dismissiveness might be that she is uncertain about what she wants and what to do about it, especially if you guys haven't discussed kids or what would happen in the event of an unplanned pregnancy. It can be a panicy thing to have an unplanned pregnancy and while I don't condone her behavior, it would not be out of character for a woman who suspects/knows she's pregnant and is now panicking about how to manage it.", "I don't think YTA for being upset. Though I would be more concerned about her seemingly excessive sleeping which could be signs of depression or some other malady. Focus on her health first and the housework will go back to what it was before.", "I think I\u2019m done with this forum. The double standards are ridiculous. If this was a female OP complaining about a male partner, you would all be demonising the poor guy and telling her it\u2019s a red flag, dump him. But because it\u2019s a woman, you blame him and say she must be either pregnant or unwell. There\u2019s always an excuse when it\u2019s a woman. \n\nI\u2019m done.\n\n\nObviously, OP is NTA.", "INFO It sounds like she's experiencing severe fatigue.

I suggest a trip to the doctor. \n\nIf she\u2019s sleeping then making dinner for yourself and doing your own dishes shouldn\u2019t be something you complain about. \n\nThe way you handled it makes YTA. Honestly I think it\u2019s a little strange you both nap that late. Just get home get your shit done and go to bed early.\n\nEdited to add: y\u2019all either I miss read something or OP edited the post. I swear the original post (I read it when it was only a few minutes old) said that OP yelled at her and refused to let her sleep. It said nothing about her getting yep etc. \n\nAs the post reads now I\u2019d have said NAH and they both need to figure out a sleep schedule and chore schedule that works for them.", "I am not going to make a call because I would need more details about the situation. When things calm down, I think you do need to have a talk with her and ask her gently what is going on.  Don't attack her verbally or try to shame her but have a real talk with her because otherwise she will be defensive (stay calm). Don't talk about all the extra things that you have been doing etc. You might be surprised that she might be feeling overwhelmed with work, depressed or there might be something physically wrong with her. Extreme fatigue can be a sign of so many issues. She might also be feeling guilty about sleeping so much but can't help herself which makes her defensive.\n\nFrankly, I would encourage her to go see a doctor to get her bloodwork done. I remember a long time ago, my sister was sleeping a lot as well. She would come straight from work and basically eat and go to bed. She was completely exhausted. Turns out her thyroid was out of whack and now when she talks about that time in her life, she says that she could not help herself and she was incredibly tired. My BIL found it very hard as well but they got through it because she got checked out and got on the right meds. She might also need a check-up to rule out other issues.\n\nPerhaps she is also suffering from depression. I know when I was, I would come home from work and would sleep from 6PM to 5AM (straight). I was going through something very difficult in my  personal life and I had to put a happy face on at work but when I came home, I was  completely drained and only wanted to sleep. Just trying to keep it all inside exhausted me mentally and physically so I slept a lot.\n\nHer mom is probably just trying to protect her because after all, she is her child. I am not a big fan of a spouse running to their parents when there are issues between a couple but maybe her mom knows something more.\n\nI hope you get to work it out. I encourage you to stay calm and communicate with her without getting emotional when she is open to talk. And I am someone who has been happily married for over 32 years telling you this.", "ESH\n\nYou didn't need to snap at her, but she's been sleeping as soon as she gets home and should have realized that something is wrong enough to get checked out. She's lying about it's fine.  It isn't if it's taking away her life outside of work.", "Not trying to defend her, but probably she's depressed?", "ESH - a sudden change in behaviour like this can indicate a medical issue especially if it\u2019s related to tiredness and sleep. You and she both should be considering why she\u2019s too tired to do anything and trying to resolve the issue together.\n\nYou just getting angrier and angrier about the chore until you snap instead of being concerned for her wellbeing is just as much a problem though. It\u2019s not reasonable to assume she\u2019s doing this just to avoid housework unless you\u2019ve investigated other potential reasons for her tiredness. Has she taken a pregnancy test for example?\n\nBoth of you need to make at least a token effort to communicate better.", "YTA\n\nThis kind of fatigue isn't normal. Instead of yelling at her about chorsebyou should be working to get her to find out why she's so tired all the time.", "Soft YTA - usually when someone\u2019s sleeping this much there is a reason, she needs help and support not scolding.", "YTA.\n\nHas she taken a pregnancy test?\n\nEven if she's just tired, you don't get to boss her around", "YTA\nYes, you're frustrated but there is something going on with her, mental, physical..there is an issue there. Better move would have been to encourage her to see doctor or talk to someone if she couldn't talk to you.\nGiving her an order not to sleep was just stupid and unproductive.", "[deleted]", "Yta - it's been less than 2 weeks. The house isn't going to crumble if you do less chores while she figures out what's going on.", "NTA but did you maybe recommend to take a pregnancy test? Heard pregnant women sleep a lot in the first weeks", "YTA for making this about housework, your girlfriend needs a doctor", "YTA. I feel like you're more upset about doing most of the chores for 2 weeks than figuring out why your girlfriend is suddenly constantly exhausted. 2 weeks isn't very long, and she could be sick (depression, iron deficiency, thyroid disease, long covid, cancer etc).\n\n It's also not clear why you couldn't just do the chores with her when she gets up from her nap. Or like save chores for her to do when she is done resting? Why do the chores need to be done with you exactly when you want them done?\n\nMaybe try talking through other solutions before yelling at someone for taking naps.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Now you are only cleaning up after yourself instead of being her mom. I'll bet you are actually having an easier time of it. If and when she contacts you, ask her when she is going to stop being a burden to you? Tell her that you feel like you are a parent and she is a daughter. \n\nPerhaps couples counseling will help but unless she gets off her butt, you will be stuck here. Ask yourself what she can do to get you to trust that she will change? She will likely change for a week or three but she will likely fall back into her rut, given the opportunity. What will you do then?\n\nTalk to her. Find out what is going on in her head. Why does she think this is okay? What is she going to do about it? Tell her that running away, and getting mom to attack you, does nothing for her credibility.", "Hot take I guess but ESH.\n\nShe is dismissing your question which is shitty. You also don\u2019t get to say \u201cno\u201d to an adult deciding they want to sleep. She\u2019s not a toddler. You can have a discussion and set a boundary, and be firm about it. Say something about how you are only going to do your standard amount of chores and she needs to step back up within X days and figure out a better solution OR it\u2019s going to become a dealbreaker. It\u2019s clearly unfair to leave you with all of the household tasks. But there are other options. Perhaps she meal preps on weekends so cooking during the week is a non-issue. Perhaps she walks the dog before work, or the dishes sit in the sink until the morning and she loads the dishwasher then. There are solutions here other than stripping an adult of their bodily autonomy. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s only been 12 days. At this point I\u2019d be more concerned than mad. Such a dramatic change out of nowhere is absolutely indicative of something. If she was always spotty on chores and looking for ways to get out of them, that\u2019s one thing. But if she always contributed and suddenly needs that much sleep something is up. Depression, a medical problem, etc.\n\nAlso, not to judge, but what do you guys do that you need a nap after getting home? Those are pretty standard times to leave for a commute. Obviously this doesn\u2019t factor in at all, just curious.", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't concern you that suddenly your partner is taking naps, immediately after coming home from work and has done so every day for almost two weeks?\n\nIt could be so many things; depression, pregnancy, exhaustion.

Why don't you try a different approach.", "YTA Because you only seem concerned about chores getting done and not at all concerned about her. A sudden need to sleep that much can be a medical issue that needs to be addressed. It could be a thyroid disorder or a lot of other things.
