I stayed warm using a gas heater and wearing thick layers of clothing. NOW, after 40 years, they want me to pay for communal heating of the staircase, which suddenly became a thing this winter when gas prices went up. The system is really old, the tiny radiator doesn\u2019t even get warm in the winter and is way too small to even have an impact on a 3 story staircase. The way I see it, the gas prices went up and they are scrambling to get the money together. I don\u2019t plan on paying 30\u20ac per months (year long!) for heating, thats not working and isn\u2019t being used half of the year neither have I ever agreed to.
