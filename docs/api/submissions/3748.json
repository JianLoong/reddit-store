There actually is such a thing.  You'd be better off to work and desensitize yourself to what causes your fears, because you will always be surrounded by babies and expecting them to avoid you, totally, isn't realistic.  People will only be understanding to a certain point (you don't have to hold them or babysit them or every have any of your own, etc) but to ask people to stop mentioning them or talking about them or bringing kids into your presence is not realistic.", "YWBTA\n\nYou don't even need to open the card. \n\nUse tongs to take it out of the mailbox and drop it immediately in the garbage. \n\nSally is being a little too obtuse about sharing her baby excitement, but this, literally and figuratively, is life. Sally could be lonely and struggling with the change of having a baby. Everyone has issues. \n\nIt won't harm you at all to be polite about mail. \n\nNext time Sally messages you something about the baby, ask how she's doing? (Sally, not the baby.) She could just be looking for dialogue with an adult, and baby-on-the-brain has limited the topics she can think of. That could be a win-win for you both.", "'Sally, I suffer from something called paedophobia. I am working on it, and have come leaps and bounds, however I am still not at a point where I am comfortable with discussing, looking at or being in the presence of babies.\n\nI understand you may not grasp this, but it is a genuine phobia, and I need to set some boundaries for my own comfort. I appreciate you thinking of me for a card, however I would appreciate it if I did not receive one, and if we could refrain from discussing any human below the age of (insert age here).\n\nI hope you understand this is not about your specific child, but all children'\n\nI'm not going to give a judgement because it depends on how you approach it.\n\nIf she responds to you being defensive and rude, then she's TA. So far impossible to judge here.", "As a mom; NTA. \n\nHOWEVER; if your disgust of babies and children is truly as bad as you describe please see a therapist. It is your choice to be childfree and that is fine, but you are not going to find a childfree world. For your mental sanity I hope you can find a way to cope.", "YWNBTA, tho I would try to word your response as tactfully as possible. Something along the lines of \"thanks for thinking of me. As you know, I have my own issues with kids and babies, so I will politely pass on receiving a card.  In the future, I would appreciate if we could keep our messages and conversations to other topics.\" There is a chance this will cause you to lose her as a friend or at least getting contacted by her, since her life is now tied to her baby, and she seems to continually mention it to you despite knowing you don't want to hear about it.", "NTA\u2026I think Sally\u2019s the AH here.  She knows your position yet keeps hounding OP with baby stuff, like back off lady.  And sending Christmas cards from the baby is weird, Sally needs to grow up.", "NTA. I think it's time to enforce clear boundaries with Sally. I really don't like kids (no phobia though) and my friends know and respect this. They don't send me pictures, don't talk about the \"cute\" little things their baby has done. They know that if they want to do that, I'm not the person to go to. \n\nIf you do set clear boundaries, Sally probably will be pissed off. She sounds like the type of person who thinks her baby is the most amazing baby ever born (understandable as a mum) but does not understand that others don't feel the same way. You're not good friends anyway, so what's more important? Your boundaries or not pissing off Sally?", "Seek therapy.... A baby touching you makes you run to the bathroom.... and being in the room with one gives you anxiety...... Yeah. That ain't normal.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why people are debating this. You have been as cordial as you can about this topic, despite it being uncomfortable for you. Sally has been told these boundaries and knows about the discomfort, and continues to send you updates and photos about the baby, forcing their baby\u2019s existence onto you. Sally seems to be the type of person who thinks that everybody loves their baby because they\u2019re the best baby. If she refuses to take the several hints you\u2019ve already given her, it\u2019s your right to say \u201cI do not want a card from your baby, since babies make me uncomfortable\u201d. If she gets upset, that\u2019s on her.\n\nBut one thing the other comments do have right - talk to a professional about this. Not even for the sake of \u201cliking babies\u201d, but because this sounds deeply stressful for day-to-day life, such as going out in public. Get the help of a professional to help you better respond to the presence of babies.", "She will probably think so.  Why not just throw the card out without opening it?  You'll know what it is since it's coming from her.", "You need to go to therapy.", "Well, um, I have some bad news for you that may not make you very happy\u2026\n\n*whispers (When you came into this world, you were also a baby)*\n\nYou need to get therapy. This is not a healthy way to live- suffering over the sight of babies is extreme.\n\nYTA.", "NTA but if you want to keep her as a friend there is no easy solutions, since she will think you are rude if you say directly and she will send you more of those in any comemorations she has it done. Well, I wish you the best of luck in this anyway :)", "NTA I know how you feel I don\u2019t like kids either she knows you are uncomfortable about babies and she\u2019s trying to push her baby on to you which she knows is a boundary. Talk to her remind her about you being uncomfortable and if she pushes you drop her, so many parents think everyone should live babies and are so pushy about it (speaking from my experience)", "NAH but bad news, Sally and all your friends are going to think you are one if you tell her not to send you  a card. Saying you don't like babies is not the same thing as explaining you have a phobia, so I don't think your friend is an asshole necessarily,  but certainly annoying. If she knew how severe your phobia was and persisted, she would be going into AH territory.\n\nYou have a few options here- I think telling her not to send a card is probably your worst option as far as your social happiness goes.  You can ignore her message (\"Oh no I don't check often, I forgot\"). Although that might also cause problems.\n\nYou could give her your address, and just throw out the card without opening it, or have a friend open it and tell you what it says. If you don't send a Christmas card back inevitably she will stop sending them, especially if she gets busier in her life.\n\nAs a fellow child free person, I get the unsolicited baby nonsense. It sucks, if I send a pic of my cat to people who hate cats it's not considered socially acceptable. Parents think child free people are selfish, heartless, etc. Trying not to engaage in drama about it is the best approach. In a nicer world, everyone would accept people's reproductive choices and keep their opinions and childrens' pics to themselves, but unfortunately we do not live in such a world and avoiding the drama will allow you to avoid social stigma", "YTA. if you hate children so much you literally can't even stomach that they exist you need help. actually glad you don't want them around you because i'd never trust you around a child\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit before people start bitching, if you're \"child free\" IDGAF but stop treating children like they're not human beings and like they are purposely inconsiderate and evil or something lol", "NTA - it\u2019s weird that she keeps sending you pictures even though she knows how uncomfortable this makes you. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask her to stop, but be prepared that it might be the end of your friendship. \n\nSpeaking as a parent, people are weird about their kids. Like it is a personal attack if someone doesn\u2019t like or is uncomfortable around kids. \u201cBut you\u2019ll love MY kids\u201d \n\nIf you want to open this can of worms, I would have a gentle conversation and let her know that your aversion causes you deep anxiety and while you\u2019re sure her child is lovely, could she please not send you pictures. Again though, this could very easily result in her never speaking to you again (even though you\u2019re NTA).\n\nOtherwise, delete button and trash can.", "NTA - tell her no thanks, you would rather save a tree, save her a stamp/costs.", "If you receive unwanted mail, simply throw it in the trash.", "NTA. Well why are you friends with this person at all? You said you\u2019re not close and she spends half the time sending you annoying pictures of babies or talking about them and what not. Just go no contact.", "NTA so your baby-phobia is a little extreme, fine, you definitely need to work on that, HOWEVER that Sally knows this and still brings up her baby constantly, literally says 'I know you don't like babies', and even though you're not close friends, means she's being ridiculous. Why she's so determined to throw this as you is a mystery unless she believes in exposure therapy. Maybe just block her if you don't see her friendship as a positive in your life.", "Yes, that would be rude and awkward. Give her the address and throw the card in the trash when you receive it.", "NTA, tell her you have a mental health condition that causes you to have panic attacks when you see babies, in even pictures. From what you\u2019re posting here that is literally the truth. Tell her the truth, babies trigger panic attacks for you, and you do not know why.  If she still sends you a card, cut her out of your life.  She doesn\u2019t have to UNDERSTAND you in order to ACCEPT you, and friends accept each other as they are.", "NTA.\n\nYou told Sally you don\u2019t like babies. And she keeps sending you pictures of babies. If I told someone I don\u2019t like something and they kept sending me photos of that thing, I\u2019d get pretty annoyed. So just calmly say, \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to get any baby pictures\u201d. From there it\u2019s on her to decide if she want to continue to be your friend given your lack of interest in the more important thing in her life right now (her baby)", "NTA. Please do not give her your address, no matter what! Tell her \"No thanks\" if she continues, then tell her she is not respecting your boundary and that you do not want to receive Christmas cards, but thanks.  \n\nIf she keeps harassing you, then walk away. It is super creepy for anyone, especially someone you are not close friends with,  to continue to ask for your address. You do not owe her anything, especially for allowing her to invade your private space at home.", "NTA. I know a lot of people are saying you're being silly but fears and phobias often are silly,  that doesn't take away the fear. I don't think you'd be an AH if you say to her that you're sorry but you don't think she understands that you have a very real fear of children and that you'd rather she didn't send you cards and photos. Make it clear it's not directed at her but with all children. If she persists and you're not close with her, you could block her if she doesn't listen. I do think you need to see a therapist about this if you aren't already. Children are unavoidable, especially as you get older and more friends have children. You'll lose out on a lot of relationships with friends if you straight up avoid and don't work with someone on your phobia.", "NTA- people are being weirdly mean. Op has acknowledged baby\u2019s are a phobia, they have gotten help and are much better then they used to be and they are polite when they\u2019re friend talks about there baby. Replace baby with spider and I think people would react a lot differently. Would you like to get a letter full of spider photos if you\u2019re scared of a spider? \n\nClearly op still has a ways to go but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being a A. As long as you are polite about it I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mean to say no thank you.", "YTA\n\nNo idea why you are making such a big deal of it? You need psychological help. Your carry on about children is totally irrational and over the top.\nGet a grip.\n\nJust either tell Sally \"I'm okay not getting a Christmas card. But thank you for offering\" OR just nicely accept the card and if it freaks you out so much? Throw it out \n\nTalk about making a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA your friend should respect your boundaries. \n\nHowever, she would no doubt get upset about the whole situation. Like others have said therapy is probably a good idea as there is some underlying trauma that needs to be addressed to make your life more manageable. \n\nIn regards to the Christmas card, why not accidentally give her the wrong address? Maybe the next building/apartment block?", "YWNBTA.", "YTA. Don't open the card. Simple. Get therapy.", "you do realize that babies are people, right?", "You have serious fcking issues and need therapy. Are you aware babies and children for that matter are a part of society? Get a grip.", "NTA you have a thing about babies and don\u2019t care for them BUT be prepped for sally to not want to be your friend anymore I wouldn\u2019t.", "Considering this is an actual phobia, Sally knows how you feel( maybe she doesn\u2019t know it is a phobia?), and she continues to push the pics, I would have to say YWNBTA, unless you can just not see the card? How important is the friendship? She is going to be hurt, and maybe she doesn\u2019t realize it is a phobia, like spiders? INFO Does Sally know this causes you intense stress? It may end the friendship.", "YTA\n\nYou can absolutely be child free. However, you need therapy for whatever is going on with you.", "NAH. You're not wrong for not wanting to constantly hear about someone's baby. Your friend isn't wrong for being joyful about her children, even if some of it seems over the top or cringe inducing. It's harmless, and it's obviously her building memories and doing crafts with her young child. Since you're not close, you could potentially tell her you're not comfortable handing out your address. You could also just throw it out upon arrival.\n\nBut OP, listen. I grew up with a severe phobia. It was so bad, I basically refused to go outside if what I feared would even remotely be present. I hated pictures, and I put my family through chaos trying to ensure I wouldn't encounter what it was. I had panic attacks, I would lock myself in rooms, and rub my skin raw in the shower if my fear touched me.\nI know it's extremely difficult, but get help. There's many reasons why it's unhealthy, but it's also dangerous to some extent. What happens when you're forced into situations around babies and toddlers? Enclosed spaces? Emergencies? Are you willing to miss future events? Willing to avoid family or close friends who eventually start families?\n\nGet help. Go to therapy. I had to, and not being terrified randomly relieved so much pressure and anxiety from me.", "I'm gonna say NTA.  I am also extremely uncomfortable around small children.  We KNOW is not normal.  We know is something we can't avoid.  It just is.   \n\n\n\"Sally\" is kinda an AH though for forcing her kid on you.   People do it to me all the time.  \"I know you don't like kids BUT...\" as though their kid will somehow change my mind.\n\nFunny enough....I HAVE a kid.  She's grown now.  Never felt anything negative towards her whatsoever.  She's the best.  But my maternal instinct doesn't extend towards other people's kids.", "YTA. My brother used to have this reaction to amputees.

Just tell her no thanks! Why are you making out that she's forcing something on you? She asked you if you wanted one, you ignored her now she's asking again - just answer the question! \n\nI'm not questioning the reality of your phobia, but it seems like you're almost inviting this attention.

I\u2019d never ask you to babysit, etc. But I don\u2019t know how you function in the world expecting everyone to pretend their children don\u2019t exist to protect your comfortable little bubble. You aren\u2019t really a friend if your friend can\u2019t even talk about their child. That\u2019s not how friendships work. You aren\u2019t the centre of the universe.

When someone has a baby it is (usually, if all goes well) the most important thing in their life, and later on their kids are the most important thing, and so on.\n\nYou'll need to accept this and adapt by either:\n\n\\--Cutting out everyone except the childfree\n\n\\--Just, y'know, dealing.\n\nMild YTA.", "NTA.

You need to put a clear boundary in place about content you are comfortable receiving, as it sounds like recieving anything baby related sets off stress/trauma responses.  If you're not already working with a therapist I highly recommend it, as it is impacting your life and relationships.  However, your friend has created this little life and is excited to share it with the world, as they think it's the best thing ever.  Explain to her that you have a physical and psychological reaction to baby related topics and for your wellbeing you need her to stop sending baby messages.  Make sure she knows it's not personal to her baby, it's all babies but her baby is not an exception to it.", "NTA. What I would do is simply tell her : listen Sally, as you are well aware, I have a CONDITION for which I am seeking therapy at the moment. Whilst I m sure your baby is amazing and you are so proud of him/her, I would kindly ask you to skip the card sending this year. I value you as a friend and also our relationship and I respect you, so I wanted to be honest about being uncomfortable in this situation.\n\nThank you so much for understanding and I hope I didn't offend you. You are wonderful and so is your baby, it s just that I have this problem that I need to fix.", "Nta. Yall realize that the irrational fear of children is prevalent enough that it has its own name. Pedophobia is a real thing and is not considered any more ridiculous then people who have a fear of clowns. Yes it is completely irrational, that's what makes it a phobia. It is not silly or ridiculous, nor is it the same as a person who just chooses to be child free. The amount of abalism in this post is gross. Yall go around telling people with OCD they are silly or ridiculous or to get over it? No. Yet here you are doing that to someone who is suffering from literally the same category of mental illness. Op you are not an asshole for not wanting unsolicited distressing images of your phobia from someone who isn't even a close friend in need. Tell her politely you are happy she is happy, but you are not ok with someone disrespecting your very REAL condition. If she keeps it up, you may have to just cut the friendship.", "Nta", "NTA. As a mom of grown children, I would completely respect your decision. She should as well.", "Wait, Sally knows yet she spams baby pics? Eh, why do you put up with this woman who makes her baby her whole personality?\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA, it's weird how with some people the moment they have a baby everything they do is about the baby including their friendships. \nLike if you don't want a Christmas card just politely decline, you're not required to accept things you don't want and tbh not everyones into christmas cards. \nBut on another note you should probably get some help, it's okay to not be fond of kids as a general thing but that seems like a more extreme issue than a \"I dont like kids\". \nMaybe talk to your GP or a counselor.", "NTA. You told her about your phobia, and she constantly chooses to ignore it. Phobias are real and should be respected, even if they don\u2019t make sense to others. If you\u2019re non confrontational, just let her send it then throw it away. OR, if you don\u2019t care about her feelings, block her.", "I had to deal with this after losing my daughter. Seeing babies made me anxious and sad, screaming ones caused a full blown panic attack (I actually blacked out when I went to the Disney store at a mall and it was announced over the speakers that Mickey and Minnie would be video chatting in ten minutes. After that every child in the store started screaming... Next thing I knew I was sitting outside on a bench with my head between my knees and a friend sitting with me ready to call an ambulance)\n\nI'm in therapy and doing much better. I held a baby for the first time since then a few months ago. But baby pictures are still triggering, and live ones and videos are worse unless I'm in a good head space and prepared. Thankfully the people around me are understanding even though I used to be the one grabbing the babies first and honorary aunt to every child I met. My bio nephew looking almost exactly like my daughter actually caused a backslide.\n\nI know there's nothing rational about what I deal with, but people are understanding because they go, \"oh well it's because she lost her baby!\"", "I'm wondering if OP has been to therapy to figure out where this issue comes from. It's pretty hard to avoid them entirely just existing", "This is how I handle things as well. I think my mom friends appreciate someone who asks about THEM and not their child, since that seems to be everyone else's focus.\n\nI've even given gifts for mom and not baby at baby showers (snacks, hand cream, cosy socks etc) and they were really well received.", "She says she\u2019s not that close to her. I\u2019d turn round and say I don\u2019t give my address out besides to close friends. Thank you tho.", "Give her the wrong address, maybe have her send it to your Mum's house. That way, if a card arrives for you at your Mum's, you'll know who it's from and you can bin it without opening it. If she asks, just say you never received it.\n\nWeighing in as someone that is child-free. A lot of my friends have had, (or are now having), babies, and  they kind of get beer-goggles for their own kid. They genuinely think everyone cares as much about their baby as they do, (and I do care. I don't hate babies, but being sent 49 pictures of someone's toddler eating spaghetti is a little much for me.)\n\nMy point is, this is a temporary solution to a problem that is going to keep recurring unless you deal with the root of it. A lot of your friends are going to have babies at some point, and you need to either find a way to have these sensitive conversations or find a way to cope with people doing shit like this.", ">You don't even need to open the card. \n\nIf OP gets multiple cards in the post how will they know which is from the mother & baby? I only know 1 friends handwriting by look, but that's mainly because she addresses it as Princess ActionParsnip.\n\nIn theory it's a cracking idea to throw it away without opening it but in reality it could prove trickier.", "This is the most rational comment in this thread", "If she wants adult dialogue I\u2019m sure remembers how conversations worked before she had a baby. If she and OP aren\u2019t close it\u2019s not really OP\u2019s job to go out of her way to easy her loneliness. Especially since she knows OP doesn\u2019t like babies.", "Another baby hating child free by choice rant on Reddit. Dude, get a grip, and therapy for panic attacks seeing a baby around you for 2 minutes. That\u2019s not within normal bounds.", "I actually think that the kindest thing for Sally would be for OP to ghost her entirely. It is creepy to think of poor Sally sending nice messages and getting \"nice!\" as a response, never knowing that OP is despising and bearing such ill-will towards this completely innocent human who has done nothing to her.", "She chose to have the baby.

In that case I can see where you're coming from, my main point was that the previous commenter had suggested that OP was overreacting by not wanting to receive the card, there's many ways the baby could be involved in making the card that could easily contribute to whatever it is about babies that OP dislikes so much, with hygiene being a suggestion as to what that was.
