There actually is such a thing.  You'd be better off to work and desensitize yourself to what causes your fears, because you will always be surrounded by babies and expecting them to avoid you, totally, isn't realistic.  People will only be understanding to a certain point (you don't have to hold them or babysit them or every have any of your own, etc) but to ask people to stop mentioning them or talking about them or bringing kids into your presence is not realistic.", "YWBTA\n\nYou don't even need to open the card. \n\nUse tongs to take it out of the mailbox and drop it immediately in the garbage. \n\nSally is being a little too obtuse about sharing her baby excitement, but this, literally and figuratively, is life. Sally could be lonely and struggling with the change of having a baby. Everyone has issues. \n\nIt won't harm you at all to be polite about mail. \n\nNext time Sally messages you something about the baby, ask how she's doing? (Sally, not the baby.) She could just be looking for dialogue with an adult, and baby-on-the-brain has limited the topics she can think of. That could be a win-win for you both.", "'Sally, I suffer from something called paedophobia. I am working on it, and have come leaps and bounds, however I am still not at a point where I am comfortable with discussing, looking at or being in the presence of babies.\n\nI understand you may not grasp this, but it is a genuine phobia, and I need to set some boundaries for my own comfort. I appreciate you thinking of me for a card, however I would appreciate it if I did not receive one, and if we could refrain from discussing any human below the age of (insert age here).\n\nI hope you understand this is not about your specific child, but all children'\n\nI'm not going to give a judgement because it depends on how you approach it.\n\nIf she responds to you being defensive and rude, then she's TA. So far impossible to judge here.", "As a mom; NTA. \n\nHOWEVER; if your disgust of babies and children is truly as bad as you describe please see a therapist. It is your choice to be childfree and that is fine, but you are not going to find a childfree world. For your mental sanity I hope you can find a way to cope.", "YWNBTA, tho I would try to word your response as tactfully as possible. Something along the lines of \"thanks for thinking of me. As you know, I have my own issues with kids and babies, so I will politely pass on receiving a card.  In the future, I would appreciate if we could keep our messages and conversations to other topics.\" There is a chance this will cause you to lose her as a friend or at least getting contacted by her, since her life is now tied to her baby, and she seems to continually mention it to you despite knowing you don't want to hear about it.", "NTA\u2026I think Sally\u2019s the AH here.  She knows your position yet keeps hounding OP with baby stuff, like back off lady.  And sending Christmas cards from the baby is weird, Sally needs to grow up.", "NTA. I think it's time to enforce clear boundaries with Sally. I really don't like kids (no phobia though) and my friends know and respect this. They don't send me pictures, don't talk about the \"cute\" little things their baby has done. They know that if they want to do that, I'm not the person to go to. \n\nIf you do set clear boundaries, Sally probably will be pissed off. She sounds like the type of person who thinks her baby is the most amazing baby ever born (understandable as a mum) but does not understand that others don't feel the same way. You're not good friends anyway, so what's more important? Your boundaries or not pissing off Sally?", "Seek therapy.... A baby touching you makes you run to the bathroom.... and being in the room with one gives you anxiety...... Yeah. That ain't normal.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why people are debating this. You have been as cordial as you can about this topic, despite it being uncomfortable for you. Sally has been told these boundaries and knows about the discomfort, and continues to send you updates and photos about the baby, forcing their baby\u2019s existence onto you. Sally seems to be the type of person who thinks that everybody loves their baby because they\u2019re the best baby. If she refuses to take the several hints you\u2019ve already given her, it\u2019s your right to say \u201cI do not want a card from your baby, since babies make me uncomfortable\u201d. If she gets upset, that\u2019s on her.\n\nBut one thing the other comments do have right - talk to a professional about this. Not even for the sake of \u201cliking babies\u201d, but because this sounds deeply stressful for day-to-day life, such as going out in public. Get the help of a professional to help you better respond to the presence of babies.", "She will probably think so.  Why not just throw the card out without opening it?  You'll know what it is since it's coming from her.", "[deleted]", "Well, um, I have some bad news for you that may not make you very happy\u2026\n\n*whispers (When you came into this world, you were also a baby)*\n\nYou need to get therapy. This is not a healthy way to live- suffering over the sight of babies is extreme.\n\nYTA.", "NTA but if you want to keep her as a friend there is no easy solutions, since she will think you are rude if you say directly and she will send you more of those in any comemorations she has it done. Well, I wish you the best of luck in this anyway :)", "NTA I know how you feel I don\u2019t like kids either she knows you are uncomfortable about babies and she\u2019s trying to push her baby on to you which she knows is a boundary. Talk to her remind her about you being uncomfortable and if she pushes you drop her, so many parents think everyone should live babies and are so pushy about it (speaking from my experience)", "NAH but bad news, Sally and all your friends are going to think you are one if you tell her not to send you  a card. Saying you don't like babies is not the same thing as explaining you have a phobia, so I don't think your friend is an asshole necessarily,  but certainly annoying. If she knew how severe your phobia was and persisted, she would be going into AH territory.\n\nYou have a few options here- I think telling her not to send a card is probably your worst option as far as your social happiness goes.  You can ignore her message (\"Oh no I don't check often, I forgot\"). Although that might also cause problems.\n\nYou could give her your address, and just throw out the card without opening it, or have a friend open it and tell you what it says. If you don't send a Christmas card back inevitably she will stop sending them, especially if she gets busier in her life.\n\nAs a fellow child free person, I get the unsolicited baby nonsense. It sucks, if I send a pic of my cat to people who hate cats it's not considered socially acceptable. Parents think child free people are selfish, heartless, etc. Trying not to engaage in drama about it is the best approach. In a nicer world, everyone would accept people's reproductive choices and keep their opinions and childrens' pics to themselves, but unfortunately we do not live in such a world and avoiding the drama will allow you to avoid social stigma", "YTA. if you hate children so much you literally can't even stomach that they exist you need help. actually glad you don't want them around you because i'd never trust you around a child\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit before people start bitching, if you're \"child free\" IDGAF but stop treating children like they're not human beings and like they are purposely inconsiderate and evil or something lol", "NTA - it\u2019s weird that she keeps sending you pictures even though she knows how uncomfortable this makes you. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask her to stop, but be prepared that it might be the end of your friendship. \n\nSpeaking as a parent, people are weird about their kids. Like it is a personal attack if someone doesn\u2019t like or is uncomfortable around kids. \u201cBut you\u2019ll love MY kids\u201d \n\nIf you want to open this can of worms, I would have a gentle conversation and let her know that your aversion causes you deep anxiety and while you\u2019re sure her child is lovely, could she please not send you pictures. Again though, this could very easily result in her never speaking to you again (even though you\u2019re NTA).\n\nOtherwise, delete button and trash can.", "NTA - tell her no thanks, you would rather save a tree, save her a stamp/costs.", "If you receive unwanted mail, simply throw it in the trash.", "NTA. Well why are you friends with this person at all? You said you\u2019re not close and she spends half the time sending you annoying pictures of babies or talking about them and what not. Just go no contact.", "NTA so your baby-phobia is a little extreme, fine, you definitely need to work on that, HOWEVER that Sally knows this and still brings up her baby constantly, literally says 'I know you don't like babies', and even though you're not close friends, means she's being ridiculous. Why she's so determined to throw this as you is a mystery unless she believes in exposure therapy. Maybe just block her if you don't see her friendship as a positive in your life.", "Yes, that would be rude and awkward. Give her the address and throw the card in the trash when you receive it.", "NTA, tell her you have a mental health condition that causes you to have panic attacks when you see babies, in even pictures. From what you\u2019re posting here that is literally the truth. Tell her the truth, babies trigger panic attacks for you, and you do not know why.  If she still sends you a card, cut her out of your life.  She doesn\u2019t have to UNDERSTAND you in order to ACCEPT you, and friends accept each other as they are.", "NTA.\n\nYou told Sally you don\u2019t like babies. And she keeps sending you pictures of babies. If I told someone I don\u2019t like something and they kept sending me photos of that thing, I\u2019d get pretty annoyed. So just calmly say, \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to get any baby pictures\u201d. From there it\u2019s on her to decide if she want to continue to be your friend given your lack of interest in the more important thing in her life right now (her baby)", "NTA. Please do not give her your address, no matter what! Tell her \"No thanks\" if she continues, then tell her she is not respecting your boundary and that you do not want to receive Christmas cards, but thanks.  \n\nIf she keeps harassing you, then walk away. It is super creepy for anyone, especially someone you are not close friends with,  to continue to ask for your address. You do not owe her anything, especially for allowing her to invade your private space at home.", "NTA. I know a lot of people are saying you're being silly but fears and phobias often are silly,  that doesn't take away the fear. I don't think you'd be an AH if you say to her that you're sorry but you don't think she understands that you have a very real fear of children and that you'd rather she didn't send you cards and photos. Make it clear it's not directed at her but with all children. If she persists and you're not close with her, you could block her if she doesn't listen. I do think you need to see a therapist about this if you aren't already. Children are unavoidable, especially as you get older and more friends have children. You'll lose out on a lot of relationships with friends if you straight up avoid and don't work with someone on your phobia.", "NTA- people are being weirdly mean. Op has acknowledged baby\u2019s are a phobia, they have gotten help and are much better then they used to be and they are polite when they\u2019re friend talks about there baby. Replace baby with spider and I think people would react a lot differently. Would you like to get a letter full of spider photos if you\u2019re scared of a spider? \n\nClearly op still has a ways to go but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being a A. As long as you are polite about it I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mean to say no thank you.", "[removed]", "NTA your friend should respect your boundaries. \n\nHowever, she would no doubt get upset about the whole situation. Like others have said therapy is probably a good idea as there is some underlying trauma that needs to be addressed to make your life more manageable. \n\nIn regards to the Christmas card, why not accidentally give her the wrong address? Maybe the next building/apartment block?", "YWNBTA.", "YTA. Don't open the card. Simple.

You're not wrong for not wanting to constantly hear about someone's baby. Your friend isn't wrong for being joyful about her children, even if some of it seems over the top or cringe inducing. It's harmless, and it's obviously her building memories and doing crafts with her young child. Since you're not close, you could potentially tell her you're not comfortable handing out your address. You could also just throw it out upon arrival.\n\nBut OP, listen. I grew up with a severe phobia. It was so bad, I basically refused to go outside if what I feared would even remotely be present. I hated pictures, and I put my family through chaos trying to ensure I wouldn't encounter what it was. I had panic attacks, I would lock myself in rooms, and rub my skin raw in the shower if my fear touched me.\nI know it's extremely difficult, but get help. There's many reasons why it's unhealthy, but it's also dangerous to some extent. What happens when you're forced into situations around babies and toddlers? Enclosed spaces? Emergencies? Are you willing to miss future events? Willing to avoid family or close friends who eventually start families?\n\nGet help. Go to therapy. I had to, and not being terrified randomly relieved so much pressure and anxiety from me.", "I'm gonna say NTA.  I am also extremely uncomfortable around small children.  We KNOW is not normal.  We know is something we can't avoid.  It just is.   \n\n\n\"Sally\" is kinda an AH though for forcing her kid on you.   People do it to me all the time.  \"I know you don't like kids BUT...\" as though their kid will somehow change my mind.\n\nFunny enough....I HAVE a kid.  She's grown now.  Never felt anything negative towards her whatsoever.  She's the best.  But my maternal instinct doesn't extend towards other people's kids.", "YTA. My brother used to have this reaction to amputees.

Calmly and politely.\n\nSo NTA really.\n\nThat being said, I share your disgust but this phobia needs to be addressed.

I\u2019ve had friends send one of their pet for example. So perhaps since it is Sally\u2019s baby\u2019s first Christmas she is sending one of the baby. This is quite normal. \n\nAlso having a baby is a big part of someone\u2019s life and I\u2019d say if you don\u2019t want to hear about the baby you just shouldn\u2019t be friends with Sally and end contact.

She has said \"I know you don't like babies...\" but does she know the extent to which you dislike babies? Granted, this is your trauma and you aren't forced to disclose it, but I would weigh whether being more open about this issue would do more good than harm in the long run with this person. \n\nSecondly, does Sally know you \"aren't that close of friends?\" Because if she's close enough to know how much you dislike babies, and you're in group chats together, and she's comfortable enough sending cards and telling you about her life, maybe she thinks you are better friends than you've led on. \n\nWithout extra info, I'm inclined to award ESH--Sally should pick up on the subtlety in \"okay\" and \"thanks\" in response to her updates. But it harms you none to be upfront with her (which shouldn't be a problem since you aren't really friends and therefore probably aren't worried about hurting her feelings) or to simply leave her on read, or block her from sending texts.", "YTA.
