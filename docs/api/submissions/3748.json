I don\u2019t know what caused such an intense reaction, but it\u2019s always been like this. I\u2019ve been working on at least being more cordial and tolerant with babies and toddlers to the point that I no longer have panic attacks. However, they still make me very uncomfortable and I don\u2019t want anything to do with them.\n\nI have a friend (we\u2019ll call her Sally) who knows that I do not like babies and how uncomfortable they make me. Sally had a baby several months back. I was polite and congratulated her. Ever since, every so often, she\u2019ll randomly message me about her baby.

I don\u2019t want to be mean, so I just give the minimal response. I delete photo\u2019s immediately (usually our conversations too) cause I\u2019m not interested. Sally and I are not, nor have we ever been, close friends. \n\nRecently, Sally posted in a group chat we\u2019re both in asking for people\u2019s addresses if they want to receive a Christmas card from her baby (that\u2019s how she worded it).

There actually is such a thing.  You'd be better off to work and desensitize yourself to what causes your fears, because you will always be surrounded by babies and expecting them to avoid you, totally, isn't realistic.  People will only be understanding to a certain point (you don't have to hold them or babysit them or every have any of your own, etc) but to ask people to stop mentioning them or talking about them or bringing kids into your presence is not realistic.", "YWBTA\n\nYou don't even need to open the card. \n\nUse tongs to take it out of the mailbox and drop it immediately in the garbage. \n\nSally is being a little too obtuse about sharing her baby excitement, but this, literally and figuratively, is life. Sally could be lonely and struggling with the change of having a baby. Everyone has issues. \n\nIt won't harm you at all to be polite about mail. \n\nNext time Sally messages you something about the baby, ask how she's doing? (Sally, not the baby.) She could just be looking for dialogue with an adult, and baby-on-the-brain has limited the topics she can think of. That could be a win-win for you both.", "'Sally, I suffer from something called paedophobia. I am working on it, and have come leaps and bounds, however I am still not at a point where I am comfortable with discussing, looking at or being in the presence of babies.\n\nI understand you may not grasp this, but it is a genuine phobia, and I need to set some boundaries for my own comfort. I appreciate you thinking of me for a card, however I would appreciate it if I did not receive one, and if we could refrain from discussing any human below the age of (insert age here).\n\nI hope you understand this is not about your specific child, but all children'\n\nI'm not going to give a judgement because it depends on how you approach it.\n\nIf she responds to you being defensive and rude, then she's TA. So far impossible to judge here.", "As a mom; NTA. \n\nHOWEVER; if your disgust of babies and children is truly as bad as you describe please see a therapist. It is your choice to be childfree and that is fine, but you are not going to find a childfree world. For your mental sanity I hope you can find a way to cope.", "YWNBTA, tho I would try to word your response as tactfully as possible. Something along the lines of \"thanks for thinking of me. As you know, I have my own issues with kids and babies, so I will politely pass on receiving a card.  In the future, I would appreciate if we could keep our messages and conversations to other topics.\" There is a chance this will cause you to lose her as a friend or at least getting contacted by her, since her life is now tied to her baby, and she seems to continually mention it to you despite knowing you don't want to hear about it.", "NTA\u2026I think Sally\u2019s the AH here.  She knows your position yet keeps hounding OP with baby stuff, like back off lady.  And sending Christmas cards from the baby is weird, Sally needs to grow up.", "NTA. I think it's time to enforce clear boundaries with Sally. I really don't like kids (no phobia though) and my friends know and respect this. They don't send me pictures, don't talk about the \"cute\" little things their baby has done. They know that if they want to do that, I'm not the person to go to. \n\nIf you do set clear boundaries, Sally probably will be pissed off. She sounds like the type of person who thinks her baby is the most amazing baby ever born (understandable as a mum) but does not understand that others don't feel the same way. You're not good friends anyway, so what's more important? Your boundaries or not pissing off Sally?", "Seek therapy.... A baby touching you makes you run to the bathroom.... and being in the room with one gives you anxiety...... Yeah. That ain't normal.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why people are debating this. You have been as cordial as you can about this topic, despite it being uncomfortable for you. Sally has been told these boundaries and knows about the discomfort, and continues to send you updates and photos about the baby, forcing their baby\u2019s existence onto you. Sally seems to be the type of person who thinks that everybody loves their baby because they\u2019re the best baby. If she refuses to take the several hints you\u2019ve already given her, it\u2019s your right to say \u201cI do not want a card from your baby, since babies make me uncomfortable\u201d. If she gets upset, that\u2019s on her.\n\nBut one thing the other comments do have right - talk to a professional about this. Not even for the sake of \u201cliking babies\u201d, but because this sounds deeply stressful for day-to-day life, such as going out in public. Get the help of a professional to help you better respond to the presence of babies.", "She will probably think so.  Why not just throw the card out without opening it?  You'll know what it is since it's coming from her.", "[deleted]", "Well, um, I have some bad news for you that may not make you very happy\u2026\n\n*whispers (When you came into this world, you were also a baby)*\n\nYou need to get therapy. This is not a healthy way to live- suffering over the sight of babies is extreme.\n\nYTA.", "NTA but if you want to keep her as a friend there is no easy solutions, since she will think you are rude if you say directly and she will send you more of those in any comemorations she has it done. Well, I wish you the best of luck in this anyway :)", "NTA I know how you feel I don\u2019t like kids either she knows you are uncomfortable about babies and she\u2019s trying to push her baby on to you which she knows is a boundary. Talk to her remind her about you being uncomfortable and if she pushes you drop her, so many parents think everyone should like babies and are so pushy about it (speaking from my experience)", "NAH but bad news, Sally and all your friends are going to think you are one if you tell her not to send you  a card. Saying you don't like babies is not the same thing as explaining you have a phobia, so I don't think your friend is an asshole necessarily,  but certainly annoying. If she knew how severe your phobia was and persisted, she would be going into AH territory.\n\nYou have a few options here- I think telling her not to send a card is probably your worst option as far as your social happiness goes.  You can ignore her message (\"Oh no I don't check often, I forgot\"). Although that might also cause problems.\n\nYou could give her your address, and just throw out the card without opening it, or have a friend open it and tell you what it says. If you don't send a Christmas card back inevitably she will stop sending them, especially if she gets busier in her life.\n\nAs a fellow child free person, I get the unsolicited baby nonsense. It sucks, if I send a pic of my cat to people who hate cats it's not considered socially acceptable. Parents think child free people are selfish, heartless, etc. Trying not to engaage in drama about it is the best approach. In a nicer world, everyone would accept people's reproductive choices and keep their opinions and childrens' pics to themselves, but unfortunately we do not live in such a world and avoiding the drama will allow you to avoid social stigma", "YTA. if you hate children so much you literally can't even stomach that they exist you need help. actually glad you don't want them around you because i'd never trust you around a child\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit before people start bitching, if you're \"child free\" IDGAF but stop treating children like they're not human beings and like they are purposely inconsiderate and evil or something lol", "NTA - it\u2019s weird that she keeps sending you pictures even though she knows how uncomfortable this makes you. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask her to stop, but be prepared that it might be the end of your friendship. \n\nSpeaking as a parent, people are weird about their kids. Like it is a personal attack if someone doesn\u2019t like or is uncomfortable around kids. \u201cBut you\u2019ll love MY kids\u201d \n\nIf you want to open this can of worms, I would have a gentle conversation and let her know that your aversion causes you deep anxiety and while you\u2019re sure her child is lovely, could she please not send you pictures. Again though, this could very easily result in her never speaking to you again (even though you\u2019re NTA).\n\nOtherwise, delete button and trash can.", "NTA - tell her no thanks, you would rather save a tree, save her a stamp/costs.", "If you receive unwanted mail, simply throw it in the trash.", "NTA. Well why are you friends with this person at all? You said you\u2019re not close and she spends half the time sending you annoying pictures of babies or talking about them and what not. Just go no contact.", "NTA so your baby-phobia is a little extreme, fine, you definitely need to work on that, HOWEVER that Sally knows this and still brings up her baby constantly, literally says 'I know you don't like babies', and even though you're not close friends, means she's being ridiculous. Why she's so determined to throw this as you is a mystery unless she believes in exposure therapy. Maybe just block her if you don't see her friendship as a positive in your life.", "Yes, that would be rude and awkward. Give her the address and throw the card in the trash when you receive it.", "NTA, tell her you have a mental health condition that causes you to have panic attacks when you see babies, in even pictures. From what you\u2019re posting here that is literally the truth. Tell her the truth, babies trigger panic attacks for you, and you do not know why.  If she still sends you a card, cut her out of your life.  She doesn\u2019t have to UNDERSTAND you in order to ACCEPT you, and friends accept each other as they are.", "NTA.\n\nYou told Sally you don\u2019t like babies. And she keeps sending you pictures of babies. If I told someone I don\u2019t like something and they kept sending me photos of that thing, I\u2019d get pretty annoyed. So just calmly say, \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to get any baby pictures\u201d. From there it\u2019s on her to decide if she want to continue to be your friend given your lack of interest in the most important thing in her life right now (her baby)\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA. Please do not give her your address, no matter what! Tell her \"No thanks\" if she continues, then tell her she is not respecting your boundary and that you do not want to receive Christmas cards, but thanks.  \n\nIf she keeps harassing you, then walk away. It is super creepy for anyone, especially someone you are not close friends with,  to continue to ask for your address. You do not owe her anything, especially for allowing her to invade your private space at home.", "NTA. I know a lot of people are saying you're being silly but fears and phobias often are silly,  that doesn't take away the fear. I don't think you'd be an AH if you say to her that you're sorry but you don't think she understands that you have a very real fear of children and that you'd rather she didn't send you cards and photos. Make it clear it's not directed at her but with all children. If she persists and you're not close with her, you could block her if she doesn't listen. I do think you need to see a therapist about this if you aren't already. Children are unavoidable, especially as you get older and more friends have children. You'll lose out on a lot of relationships with friends if you straight up avoid and don't work with someone on your phobia.", "NTA- people are being weirdly mean. Op has acknowledged baby\u2019s are a phobia, they have gotten help and are much better then they used to be and they are polite when they\u2019re friend talks about there baby. Replace baby with spider and I think people would react a lot differently. Would you like to get a letter full of spider photos if you\u2019re scared of a spider? \n\nClearly op still has a ways to go but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being a A. As long as you are polite about it I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mean to say no thank you.", "[removed]", "NTA your friend should respect your boundaries. \n\nHowever, she would no doubt get upset about the whole situation. Like others have said therapy is probably a good idea as there is some underlying trauma that needs to be addressed to make your life more manageable. \n\nIn regards to the Christmas card, why not accidentally give her the wrong address? Maybe the next building/apartment block?", "YWNBTA.", "YTA. Don't open the card. Simple.

You're not wrong for not wanting to constantly hear about someone's baby. Your friend isn't wrong for being joyful about her children, even if some of it seems over the top or cringe inducing. It's harmless, and it's obviously her building memories and doing crafts with her young child. Since you're not close, you could potentially tell her you're not comfortable handing out your address. You could also just throw it out upon arrival.\n\nBut OP, listen. I grew up with a severe phobia. It was so bad, I basically refused to go outside if what I feared would even remotely be present. I hated pictures, and I put my family through chaos trying to ensure I wouldn't encounter what it was. I had panic attacks, I would lock myself in rooms, and rub my skin raw in the shower if my fear touched me.\nI know it's extremely difficult, but get help. There's many reasons why it's unhealthy, but it's also dangerous to some extent. What happens when you're forced into situations around babies and toddlers? Enclosed spaces? Emergencies? Are you willing to miss future events? Willing to avoid family or close friends who eventually start families?\n\nGet help. Go to therapy. I had to, and not being terrified randomly relieved so much pressure and anxiety from me.", "I'm gonna say NTA.  I am also extremely uncomfortable around small children.  We KNOW is not normal.  We know is something we can't avoid.  It just is.   \n\n\n\"Sally\" is kinda an AH though for forcing her kid on you.   People do it to me all the time.  \"I know you don't like kids BUT...\" as though their kid will somehow change my mind.\n\nFunny enough....I HAVE a kid.  She's grown now.  Never felt anything negative towards her whatsoever.  She's the best.  But my maternal instinct doesn't extend towards other people's kids.", "YTA. My brother used to have this reaction to amputees.

Explain her again your POV with all examples and limits she has to respect if she wants to keep in contact with you. Calmly and politely.\n\nSo NTA really.\n\nThat being said, I share your disgust but this phobia needs to be addressed. Not because you have to learn to like those little cradles of filth, but because there's something that makes you feel bad which has a deep psychological root and impact.\n\nDo it for yourself, not the little pooping machines.

You are entirely entitled to establish a boundary and ask Sally not to send the card.  You might alienate your friend and/or potentially lose your friendship, though.\n\nI would strongly recommend seeking out therapy, though, if you are struggling that much with babies.  You are not an AH for having a phobia - phobias are, by nature, not rational.  The people calling you an AH for it are being entirely unfair.", "NTA. You're allowed to not want baby pics.

I\u2019ve had friends send one of their pet for example. So perhaps since it is Sally\u2019s baby\u2019s first Christmas she is sending one of the baby. This is quite normal. \n\nAlso having a baby is a big part of someone\u2019s life and I\u2019d say if you don\u2019t want to hear about the baby you just shouldn\u2019t be friends with Sally and end contact. She\u2019ll have many more milestones to want to share and if you can\u2019t be happy for someone who\u2019s excited about it because of your own issues then you aren\u2019t a friend.

She has said \"I know you don't like babies...\" but does she know the extent to which you dislike babies? Granted, this is your trauma and you aren't forced to disclose it, but I would weigh whether being more open about this issue would do more good than harm in the long run with this person. \n\nSecondly, does Sally know you \"aren't that close of friends?\" Because if she's close enough to know how much you dislike babies, and you're in group chats together, and she's comfortable enough sending cards and telling you about her life, maybe she thinks you are better friends than you've led on. \n\nWithout extra info, I'm inclined to award ESH--Sally should pick up on the subtlety in \"okay\" and \"thanks\" in response to her updates. But it harms you none to be upfront with her (which shouldn't be a problem since you aren't really friends and therefore probably aren't worried about hurting her feelings) or to simply leave her on read, or block her from sending texts.", "YTA.

If you aren't close, it's not really her business, but then again if someone I am not super close with tells me that they are childfree and not particularly fond of kids there is no way I would ever think they meant the obsessively washing layers of skin, panic attack having, full-blown mental health issue you are describing. If you even low-key said that but we're laughing to try to soften the blow, I might have thought you were exaggerating for a joke. \n\nIn this case, you may consider going into more detail, politely, but stone seriously to explain that you have a legitimate mental health problem and pictures of babies cause you actual mental anguish that you aren't yet in control of. No one likes sharing personal medical information if they don't have to, but you don't just say \"I don't like peanut butter\" when what you mean is \"I will go into anaphylactic shock if I am in the presence of a Reece's Peanut Butter cup.\" \n\nAlso, for your own standard of living, I hope you get more help. Not having panic attacks is good but that is a really low bar. Babies and toddlers are just human beings. Imagine you had panic attacks around women in their ~20s and had to scrub my skin off if you came into contact with one casually, or could never recieve Kohls flyers or something because there were pictures of them on it. There is honestly no difference between those two things. Being childfree isn't being child-phobic. One is a lifestyle choice, made by adults making an informed decision about their needs, wants, and the trajectory of their life. The other is a mental health concern.", "If that's how you feel & she knows it, than you should definitely tell her!", "NAH but this is super strange from a mental health perspective and I hope you\u2019re seeking therapy.

School-age kids? Toddlers? I understand Sally isn't someone you're particularly close to, but what happens when someone you ARE close to has a kid? Would you stop talking to a sibling who procreates until their child reaches a specific age? Just put your relationship on hold for thee or four or five years?", "Honestly I\u2019m in the middle on this but think it would be reasonable to say something similar to the following:\n\nHey Sally, I\u2019m really sorry, but I need to be honest with you about something. You know how I feel about babies and your constant talk about yours and pictures of them have made me uncomfortable. I know this is my problem and I\u2019m seeking help and working on it. In the meantime, would you mind not sending me these pictures anymore? I\u2019d really appreciate it. Otherwise, I\u2019d be happy to talk to you about other things and still be there for you, but while I\u2019m working on my problem, I need a little help. Thank you for understanding.", "I'm not going to call you TA.  Something is obviously triggering you.  It might be worth going to therapy.  Possibly hypnotism to try to find out what's in your past to give you this reaction, although I'm not a therapist.  Once people have babies, it's an all-consuming part of their lives.  That's probably going to be the focus of what they have to talk about, unless they're specifically keeping in touch with you for baby-free time involving your shared interests.  If you can't find out what's wrong, you're going to lose alot of people in your life until their kids are older.\n\nI'm not trying to bully you into loving babies.  I want for you a life where you're not on high alert that you'll bump into an infant.  They're around, and that's no way to live.", "NTA but you should probably get therapy because it's a pretty messed up phobia to have. People are going to keep having kids and you will lose a lot of people acting like this.\n\nIf you're not close to Sally maybe just distance yourself, because it's not fair to expect her to pretend she doesnt have a baby every time she talks to you.

I do think getting a Christmas card from a baby is a bit weird so even I would say no thank you to that. \n\nI do suggest therapy because your reactions to being touched by a child or your ability to not be around them needs to be addressed and you need to find the source for why you're so uncomfortable.

Sally seems to know about your discomfort, and seems to push it to the side under the guise that, maybe because you two are friendly, her baby doesn't apply. In her eyes, that makes sense, but in yours, obviously, that is not the case. A boundary is a boundary, and you've been respectful about it (maybe even too respectful) -- I suggest it's time to lay the boundary firm and clear and tell her directly her baby stuff is making you upset.\n\nShe's in baby-moon and probably isn't really thinking about things, other people. Tell her you're being as gentle as you can, but you truly do not wish to receive anything about her baby, it's not personal.

I\u2019m guessing the friend would see much less of the OP because having a baby is life changing, and you tend to prune your flock of friends, whether it is conscious or subconscious.  As an aside,  remaining child free is wonderful.  Good for OP.  OP\u2019s reaction to babies seem extreme.  Wether it\u2019s her friends baby or a baby at the grocery store, the world will always have babies in it.  My advice would be for the OP to seek counsel on how to deal with the root cause of the deeper issue.  The Christmas card is a symptom of a much larger issue.", "YWBTA As someone who is a new mum I suspect that Sally may be trying to initiate conversation because she needs people to talk with while home with the baby. And to be honest, babies are all consuming and it's hard to think of other things to talk about. Someone else who commented had a great suggestion about changing the topic - ask how SHE is! She may really be struggling and not sure how to initiate conversation.\n\nAs for the card. Just throw it out? But maybe consider therapy? I know you've come a long way already but it can't be good for you to have such strong negative feelings about babies. They are literally everywhere and at a certain point post people in your life will start having them.", "Very gentle YTA. This is like when you have a favorite aunt, that happens to be really, really into plants. Sometimes you smile and nod and dutifully look at the photos of her dahlias, and listen to her rant about vermiculite shortage. Because you like her, and enjoy her company otherwise. Children have a habit of taking over the parental lives, and she is just trying to share that with you.", "I'm going to get shit but NTA. While, yes, I do think you need therapy to get to the bottom of this intense reaction, you have set a boundary that is being constantly and intentionally ignored.\n\nI have 2 kids, but just because I don't necessarily understand or share your aversion doesn't make it less valid.\n\nThis friend (who is not a friend) has been railroading you because she thinks her child is special enough to help you get over your aversion. She is not respecting your \"no\", and this is her problem.", "Just tell her \"oh I am not really into getting cards in the mail but thanks for the offer! I hope you have a wonderful holiday!\" and then be done with it. When she sends you baby updates, feel free to ignore them and she will stop once she sees you are not engaged. Of course if you want to maintain some level of friendship, respond every now and then with something generic like \"I am glad you are having so much fun with your family!\" or whatever makes sense, and then change the topic to something other than her baby. Sometimes for us parents it can seem like the kids are our entire lives and chatting about something else is really refreshing. So ask her about a hobby, career, movies, or tell her something going on in your life. But really I think telling her to stop chatting with you about her baby flat out is going to come off really rude, so I'd only use it if you really do not care about this friendship and you really don't care what everyone else in that friendship things of you because she will likely be really put off and share the interactions with friends. So only go down this road if that does not bother you at all. Otherwise I'd go with a softer approach. \n\nBut really, your baby phobia sounds very severe. This goes way beyond simply not being into babies. I would highly recommend you look into some professional help. Babies and toddlers are just small humans. You don't have to enjoy being around them, but having this level of disgust for a group of humans just because they happen to be young and small, that is not at all healthy.", "Okay. There is so many layers to this. \"I don't like babies.\" actually does not describe you. If you're describing everything accurately than you have a straight up PHOBIA of babies. I also don't really know how that happens. (I'm not going to judge you and I'll assume you're telling the truth.) But you need more than \"trying to be more cordial\". You need full on therapy. Real professional help. And you need to start it yesterday. So YTA for not getting yourself proper help. It is totally okay to be childfree and not particularly like babies. But you take it to an extremely unhealthy level. \n\nYou also need to decide if you even want to be friends with Sally or not. I think someone who doesn't suffer from a phobia would have an extremely difficult time trying to understand where you're coming from. Sally is going to be offended if you tell her that you hate her child so much that you don't even want to receive a card from them. If you want to be a good friend to Sally you need to get professional help to take this from a phobia to a preference to being childfree. Right now in your mental state you cannot be a good friend to a parent. Part of being friends with a parent is hearing about and seeing a baby. You are never under any obligation to hold or take care of the child, but you need to be in the same room as them and be nice and friendly to them. What happens if a 1-2 year old wobbled up to you? Are you going to scream at them and scar them for life? YWBTA. You're letting your phobia allow you to be mean to a child.", "NTA\n\nSome of you are missing the point.  If someone sent pictures of butchery to a vegetarian, or spider videos to an arachniphobe, they'd be an asshole.  How is this different? OP is kind of weird, sure.  Can she avoid babies indefinitely? Of course not, but she can make moves to limit exposure.\n\nIt seems like the other people gave their addresses so Sally obviously isn't an attention starved new mother and even if she was, why does that trump the visceral reaction that OP gets, that she IS working on?\n\nI have my own 6-month old and I've posted 3 public photos. Three.  I send photos privately to my parents, and put them up occasionally to my instagran close friends stories.  If someone blocks/removes me? That's fine.

So are people who have phobias of women. A phobia isn't something you can control. With children its usually the BEHAVIOR people cant stand. No matter what race, gender, disability or age someone is, it is not cruel to set boundaries against behaviors you don't like or trigger issues you have. Unlike adults though babies can't control their behavior so more often than not people who can't be around those behaviors choose to not be involved with children at all. \n\n\n\n\nI dislike children. I have a specific disorder that puts me constantly on edge and I'm extreemly prone to panic attacks. Children are loud, their crying often triggers my attacks, I dislike mess or being sticky so if one makes a mess on me ill be in the shower for HOURS to feel clean and so I avoid being around them. Yes im in therapy. Its an issue that cant really be medicated comfortably. My therapist thinks my handling of avoiding children when I can is reasonable as putting one in my care is dangerous for them since I cant handle it. Their behavior is something at that age that they can't control but I CAN control if I'm exposed to it or not. \n\n\n\nI choose not to hold babies, I won't go around certain toddlers and my family and friends are extreemly respectful of that. They don't send me baby pics or videos because they know I will not enjoy it. If it's a family event and babies start to fuss either I'll walk away or they will depending on who can move away faster, my best friend will mute her phone if he baby starts to fuss knowing the sounds spark my anxieties.

This originated from a bad breakup due to a difference of opinion regarding reproductive rights (the worst thing someone has ever told me in my life happened in this fight), but has its roots in a lot of things. I\u2019m in postsecondary education, and absolutely love my life and have a lot of career and life aspirations I want to do before ever thinking about having kids. The increasing restrictions on abortion rights in the US almost seemed like a threat to my identity. *If you get pregnant, you will be forced to be a mother, smile while everyone congratulates you, risk your life in birth, be expected to make every single sacrifice for your child, while kissing all your dreams goodbye. If you want to have any priorities or dreams beyond your child, you\u2019re selfish and wrong.* \n\nBreakup + restriction in reproductive rights + my dreams as a person = tokophobia. At its worst, I would have a panic attack whenever I read about a pregnant character in a book, or saw the word >!abortion!< in the news. Now, I just get nauseous/anxious, but I can mostly hide that in social situations. I\u2019m uncomfortable around kids and avoid them, because of the association with pregnancy. It scales with age. Above age 11, about, I actually like kids. Between ages 5-10, I\u2019m not the most patient person and I\u2019m definitely not maternal. I won\u2019t want to spend a lot of time with them, but I can tolerate them. Ages 2-5 is iffy, and again, not very maternal. Infants make me nearly panic because of how close infants are to pregnancy, by association.\n\nYes, I intend to go to therapy, I just can\u2019t afford it yet. In the meantime, I avoid kids, but I intend to support my pregnant/parent friends by doing tasks such as cooking for them, doing their dishes when they have a new kid, etc because I care for them. Until I work this phobia out, that\u2019s the line I try to toe.

But boy howdy, insert any other group.... I agree they are being seen as lesser, like pets.

Sally chose to push the matter and probably knew in advance OP would not like a Christmas card from the baby (also info: do people do this?

As a therapist who regularly works with reducing extreme reactions to day to day experiences (such as panic attacks when seeing a child) congratulations on your success in bringing those responses under more effective control. That's not easy with a trigger as challenging to avoid as \"children\", and I hope you're continuing to receive support in your efforts to cope with your distress.\n\nI regularly talk with clients during phobia treatment management about setting boundaries in their life that helps them have more control over their exposure to triggers. This seems like a fairly straightforward one. It wouldn't be reasonable to, for example, ask Sally to stop sending things to the group chat where presumably others enjoy seeing the baby. But you could kindly let her know \"Sally I care about you, and I'm so happy your baby is well and growing. Unfortunately, even as happy as I am for your family, your child is not an exception to my anxiety trigger, and it would mean a lot to me if we could reduce how often you direct baby pictures to me specifically because it's hard on me to manage my anxiety and panic every time you text me baby photos even though I'm glad you and the baby are doing well.\"\n\nIt is kind and likely an indicator of her value of you that she wants to include you in something that is meaningful to her. Unfortunately, that meaningful thing causes you significant unnecessary distress, so you are well within your rights to set a reasonable boundary around her ability to do so at will. You asking for the photos to stop will not do Sally or her baby material harm, and any emotional unhappiness that Sally feels about being asked to respect a reasonable boundary will pass as time makes clear that it was done with respect and the fervent belief that absolutely everyone will love her bundle of joy in the same way she does simmers down a bit.\n\nI'm a bit torn between NTA and NAH. I think I lean NAH as long as Sally is able to hear your boundary and respond reasonably to it with some time. But certainly YWNBTA to kindly let her know that you would prefer to be taken off the baby picture subscription list.\n\nEdit: I see that you think this might be her way of drawing closer connections to friends after a traumatic relationship experience. I think that's probably a good bet. In my opinion, if that is her goal, it's even more important to find a kind way to establish this boundary now, so that she doesn't keep pursuing a friendship with you in a way that is explicitly driving you away from her.

I think OP needs to decide if she wants to be friends with Sally anymore. A baby becomes nearly intertwined with every aspect of a parents life. Sally deserves friends she can talk to about her life.

They're going through something miraculous and wonderful for them and don't always realize that pretty much no one else is as excited about their baby's first smile or that contact nap that Dad caught a picture of. \n\nOP could try again to explain their feelings or just grin, bear it, and throw away the card/delete messages.

At the same time I still support my friends who have kids. It does change the dynamic but this is what they wanted and I want to be a part of their life. My best friend even said she appreciates that I care and love her kids especially when she knew I never wanted any. When I had dogs even my friends who didn\u2019t like dogs would still ask about them or check-in if they had surgery or had been sick.

She's had panic attacks over them in the past, but she's working with a therapist and can now handle small interactions with dogs workout panicking. Ginger's friend Bob just adopted a dog, and he's so excited about it he won't stop sending everyone, including Ginger, pictures. Ginger doesn't react to them, so Bob decides he has to send Ginger a card from his dog. Is Ginger allowed to be frustrated and want to cut Bob out? Of course, because Bob is acting like an asshole.", "that was my thought as well, if you substituted a different race, or religion for babies and toddlers people would find it shocking and horrible, this is as well, children can't control their ages.", "I agree. And I'm curious how OP handles seeing photos of themself as a baby or toddler. \n\nIt's not like babies and toddlers are some strange alien creature - OP WAS ONE at one point. Everyone was. Literally every human ever was once a baby, and then a toddler. This isn't \"child free\" or \"I don't like babies\", this is something deeper that I think really needs some therapy. Having a panic attack being in the mere presence of a baby is really severe and extreme. And if OP had this reaction about other human groups (the elderly, for example, or people of a specific race or gender presentation) there'd be a pretty extreme reaction against them. \n\nBut in the meantime OP can just not open the card, and try to steer any messages about the baby toward other subjects, IMO.", "But they don't *need* to.\n\nWould it make sense to?

The friend is likely aware op is tolerating it out of friendship because I find it hard to believe they don't recognize the complete lack of interest op is showing.

Op tolerates the conversations and seems to make it VERY clear they are only tolerating it by not engaging, giving clipped or one word answers and ending them as soon as possible.

In a world where less trash, healthcare, education, food, clean water, and space could be achieved for every child born then I would be happy to let the world populate right up to the load-bearing point.\n\nWhat this person has is a phobia, which I get to a degree - no one likes to suffer because some one isn't parenting their kid and just letting it cause a disturbance (such as throwing food in a restaurant. He got ketchup in my hair and on my blouse, kicked and screamed, and tried to grab my tits. He was 5. Parent stayed on her phone the whole time, never said anything or even looked up.)\n\nBut you can't avoid them in life, kinda like dogs or cats or bugs or meat products.

That said, it does sound like this person is working on those issues as they say they can be in a kids presence without having a panic attack now. \n\nHowever, OP messed up by responding positively. I'm silly sometimes so whenever one of my friends spams my phone with their baby (especially if poop or other body fluids are involved) I spam them with my dog doing similar acts.

So I guess you could say I see it from both sides.\n\nNAH is my verdict. Tell her \"no thank you & can we maybe talk about something else?\" Or realize her brain has been consumed and find another friend, or you could wait a couple years until the bonding hormones wear out and just respond with one word answers until then with occasional pushes to talk about how she is doing or what's going on in her life aside from the kid.\n\nHumans get obsessive easily.

This doesn't apply to humans I can at least communicate my social difficulties with, obviously, but babies have demands for positive socialization no other group have, and I get labeled as a Roald Dahl villain if I so much as cover my ears. The pitch of the laughter is worse than the pitch of their cries.\n\n With the knowledge of the negative impact of the \"blank face\" study, I can't politely ignore them, I can only hope to politely avoid them. That includes letting the parents lose the idea that I'm open to communication about the baby, because that has always turned into \"nah, I'm sure my sweet angle can make mugaccino *\"change his mind\"* about babies\" and made it their goal to trick me into holding them in the past. It's upsetting for everyone involved but I'm the one who gets blamed for ruining the moment with tears and begging. \n\nNo, therapy doesn't help with autism disoder and there is no medicine known to science that can fix me.\n\n So yeah, that is a hard boundary. I don't enjoy having to deal with my brain either, but I also don't enjoy people jumping to the worst possible conclusion that such a boundary is comparable to being a fucking racist or ableist for anyone who might have this phobia.

For example, I have PTSD from an abusive relationship where I was constantly sexually assaulted. This PTSD materialized as a phobia of men for a while. Any man, including friends/family, coming near me would make me flinch, being touched by a man would make me want to wash my skin off, just as the OP describes, if there was more than like 2 men in a room with me I would have a panic attack. I have since worked through a lot of this, but I don't think anyone would say I was a bigoted person for this. It was/is a trauma response. I'm curious if the OP has baby related trauma?

In order to even visit a specialist, I must first make an appt. w/ my GP so that I can get an official referral, or insurance won\u2019t cover it. That means I need to pay a copy for the GP visit. Then, a diagnosis is a multiple-visit process, with the more expensive specialist copay each visit.

You don't need to justify this to her, or give her reasons.**  She should have taken your lack of response to the first post about this as the answer.  But she didn't want that answer.  She wants to convince you to prioritize her child.  That's manipulative behavior, and another very good reason to not give her your address.  \n\nCan you block her?  If not, just ignore the message.

When normal people say they are uncomfortable around babies it usually means they are afraid to hold or hurt them or don't want to have children of their own.

OP is saying they are \"happily childfree\" and \"don't like babies\". \n\nIf you go around telling people \"I don't like x\" people are not going to assume you have debilitating phobia of x and to never mention it or show them an image containing it.

When most people say they don't like babies they mean something like what I wrote above, or that they find them annoying since they can cry/be noisy at times (which wouldn't be an issue over text/a photo). \n\nOP is responding to their friend talking about their baby with comments like \"okay\" or \"nice\", which may come off as not super engaged, but don't come off as OP has a phobia or is distressed friend mentioned it.  \n\nI'm unclear if OP actually thinks OP has a phobia and if they are getting professional help. Beacuse the language they use downplays the issue and dosen't say that? My cousin and one of my best friends are \"happily childfree\". That does not mean that children make them suffer and have extreme anxiety . . . that's not happy. It means they are happy well adjusted people who can handle children normally and don't have a desire to have children. \n\nAt the end of the day if OP does have a real phobia and wants people to accommodate it OP needs to admit that to themselves and then say so to others.

But somewhere along the line a good portion of society has just accepted that it's okay to say you hate children. They can't help their age any more than I can help the color of my skin.

For me, my friends who actively did not like children or babies, but wanted to still be in contact, but only without mentioning my kids, it didn\u2019t work out. My life radically changed. I have friends who don\u2019t ever want children, but accept that my life has changed, and we make it work.

Everyone happy. \n\nThis really isn't rocket science and I'm pretty damn stunned about a lot of the top comments here.", "NAH and all the YTA responses seriously need a reality check. Of course it's OPs problem to deal with their dislike of babies (which sounds more like a phobia to me) but they are NOT obligated to want a baby Christmas card. The comments would probably be different if OP was disgusted by spiders and a friend wanted to send a Christmas card of their beloved pet spider. Why can't people fathom someone being uncomfortable with babies? OPs friend of course isn't an asshole either for wanting to send the cards, but OP has every right to politely decline.", "NTA, why does Sally get to completely ignore your boundaries only because society believes that everyone MUST love kids? \n\n\nGuess what, we don't all love all kids. I love my family's kids. And that's about it. I tolerare my friend's kids and don't mind being around them. But i dont look forward to be around kids, I don't babysit unless in emergencies. And I shouldn't be forced to deal with kids if I don't want to.\n\n\n\nIf we change the word kids with \"blood\" or \"open wounds\" and Sally was constantly sending you pictures of open wounds or blood and requested your address to send you a picture of a wound, people would agree that she would be the AH, but for some reason you aren't allowed boundaries when it comes to kids \ud83d\ude44\n\n\n\n* It's good that you are working on your phobia because that does sound like an extreme and limiting reaction", "NAH. \n\nFirst, you don't have to provide your address to receive a Christmas card (or anything else) if you don't want it; no justification required. \n\nSecond, as someone with a new baby (8 months!) I would have no problem not mentioning my baby to someone who has such an aversion to them, especially if we already aren't super close to begin with. Honestly, it's nice to talk about anything but the baby sometimes and there are tons of people who love to talk about the baby and all associated baby stuff. Maybe Sally doesn't have that which is really unfortunate but clearly OP is not gonna be that person for her. I don't think Sally is an asshole either but I do think she doesn't totally grasp the depth of OP's issue and hasn't picked up the clues.\n\nFinally, OP, I'm glad you've made some progress on your baby issue because having panic attacks triggered by a common demographic in our society must've been fucking awful. I also disagree with the people saying having a phobia about babies/toddlers/etc is the same as being racist or bigoted about another type group, like black people or whatever. Phobias aren't rational in that way, and treating them is hard. I guess some of that is the fuzziness of how we use the term phobia, like with homophobia which isn't really, so they think you mean you personally hate babies instead of having an uncontrollable and extreme aversion to them. Which, again, you've made what sounds like a great deal of progress on and I hope that continues to improve for you. \n\nTo all the people jumping on the YTA or YWBTA wagon: did you read the post? Like really read it? The issue isn't whether OP needs therapy (pretty obviously OP has gotten and could still well be in therapy) but about giving out her home address to someone she doesn't know that well in order to receive something she actively doesn't want. I loved seeing all the suggestions for polite refusals, I think those are great. If OP wanted to make more of an effort, she could try to explain a little better about the issue but honestly it might not be worth the effort and maintaining some distance from this casual friend could be the right call.", "Fine, I'll take the downvotes and disagree with everyone else. YWNBTA. You've expressed to Sally clearly that you don't like babies and she even references that while sending you pictures of her baby. Really feels like she is inconsiderate about how you feel or what your reaction to that might be. Further, setting the boundary of not wanting to receive pictures that you've already expressed disinterest and discomfort with in is well within the bounds of good taste. Now, there is a way to set that boundary that would make you the asshole and other people are right that she might just be lonely or wanting to connect with another adult as her whole life right now probably revolves around this baby. See if there's any other way you could connect with her or offer support. This may also be an opportunity for you to get some exposure to a baby to help with your phobia. But however you decide to deal with it I would recommend completely honesty about how you feel because if you just keep it polite she will continue to think that its okay to make you uncomfortable in this way and it may escalate further as it has escalated now.", "Literally if this story was \"My friend who I am not close with at all wants to send me a Christmas card, and I'm not comfortable with it because we are not close friends,\" no one would call her the AH. Why is it different because the person \"wanting\" to send the card is the baby? For fucks sake, the baby doesn't want to send a card, it's literally just a friend she's not close with sending it.\n\nShe literally is getting put on the spot, she's not going out of her way to be mean or anything, the friend is being very pushy and forcing her to respond. NTA.", "Going against the majority here but NTA. \n It kills me that parents think everyone loves their kid. And the fact is, she knows you don\u2019t like children because she starts her messages with it. She\u2019s ignoring your issues because she\u2019s excited new mum. She is being very rude. I don\u2019t think it would be an AH move to very very politely say you don\u2019t want the card, and please stop telling you about her kid but you still want to talk to her about other things in her life. \n\nIf she is hurt by it, honestly, who cares. She does not care about you being uncomfortable when she sends things, so she will be ok with being a little uncomfortable in putting a stop to it.", "I'm going to go with NAH. But I think you need to consider why you're continuing your friendship with Sally. If you're not close, why not just fade the relationship out? If you like Sally, and want to make it through this hump of the young years, maybe explain to her that you have a phobia, and what you're doing to handle that for yourself, as well as how you need her to support you. \n\nI'm a younger mom, (25 pregnant with baby 3) I was ill prepared with my first for how hard motherhood would be, and how little village I would have. I'm unsurprised that Sally seems to have missed the memo about how much you *cannot* handle being around children, it's easy to do when you're caught up with your baby, the person motherhood has changed you into, and generally trying to stay sane while navigating such a strange time with limited social support. I really think a tender conversation would be your best bet if you value your friendship with this woman, and if not, cut your losses! \n\n-For everyone else in this thread- This isn't some child free person saying they hate babies, and don't want a card from their friends child. If that were the case then yeah they would be T A. Child free people who make it everyone else's problem that they don't *like* children is an entirely different matter. A phobia, that is being actively worked on, is outside of OPs control, and they're doing what they can to fix it. I know this is the internet, but Jesus can anyone get even a smidgen of grace.", "I'm sorry for people who tjink otherwise ; plus I don't really mind babies in any way, positive or negative so it's not personal, but I think OP is NTA.\n\nI mean she expressed very clearly she does want nothing near the baby and said she's not even to Sally so wth ? Why would she accept that constant harassment from her friend who could just let it go and focus on her other friends and her own business ?\n\nShe just needs to accept a \"no\". OP can work on her issue whenever she needs it.\nThink whatever you want about that comparison, but I've always been terrified of dogs. No one would leave me tf alone with their lovely lil boi that everyone loves and that constant pestering made me grow to hate dogs. But the time I met a real, understanding and long-term reason to accept them, that was it. I can pet a few of them, properly introduced ones, and now I'm an adult people just listen to me when I tell them to keep their baby love away from me. When they don't, well, they face the consequences (no, I don't hit them, I might just go away in best cases, or panic in worst).\n\nBut unlike dogs who are at every corner of any damn town, babies can be avoided. OP, just do whatever you want, Sally should get over herself and share her cards to friends who enjoy it.", "YWNBTA / NTA \n\ny w b t a comments are confusing me. \n\u201cSally\u201d is forcing OP to endure something that gives them a panic response, bc she feels that her baby is superior, an exception, and entitled to fill their mail/phone with unsolicited baby pictures. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around her baby, and no is a complete sentence. Replace that w/ an extreme phobia of dogs, and it would be plain cruel to send pictures & holiday cars FROM the dogs. (A general holiday card from the FAMILY would be slightly different, but OP is no less entitled to refuse it.) \nOP is obviously working on their issues, and that is incredibly difficult, so I applaud OP. (not everyone is in the position to get professional help.) \n\nI can set and enforce boundaries about unsolicited triggers (i.e. \u201cI\u2019m recovering from an ED- please stop sending me diet recipes and gift cards for WW.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic, please stop sending me cocktail recipes and post cards from breweries.\u201d) \nOn the other hand- it\u2019s my responsibility to manage MY triggers in public spaces. \n(i.e: Baby at a restaurant is making me uncomfortable, I LEAVE- I don\u2019t cause a scene or expect the parents to take their baby out. If i\u2019m a recovering alcoholic and I go to a bar- I can\u2019t be mad if my friends decide to drink. ) \n\nI can\u2019t impose my shit upon others, and others are not entitled to impose their shit upon me.", "The fact this is top comment is absolute ***garbage*** \\- OP has a *genuine fear response* to children and it is not their job to sit and be uncomfortable and play nice with someone who is (***knowingly***, btw) stomping over their boundaries.\n\nOPs phobia of children is not some personal attack on anyone with children - they did not wake up one day and *choose* to be terrified of babies and the number of nasty and judgmental comments thinking they can go to therapy and magic away their fear or just 'deal with it' to make someone else happy at the expense of their own mental and emotional wellbeing is gross. \n\nI share OPs phobia, and to a similar severity, and I am so sick and tired of people taking it as a personal attack or a challenge because clearly their baby won't make me panic and cry when they shove it at me. It will - I'm telling you it will. Why is it so fucking hard for some people to comprehend that your child is not the exception and is not going to magically cure my fear.\n\nI literally just want to live my life without having children shoved at me - and it sounds like OP does too - and it *really isn't much to ask that other people be mindful of the fact that not everyone is comfortable with children.*\n\nYou like babies? good for you, but I don't and ***literally all that I ask is to not have them shoved in my face when I make it clear that it causes me genuine distress. It isn't hard.

Sally could be lonely and struggling with the change of having a baby. Everyone has issues.\n\n*Absolutely fucking not*. Sally is not OPs responsibility. It is not OPs job to let this woman stomp all over their boundaries and comfort - ***Sally needs to learn how to respect others and their boundaries.*** OP is under no requirement to sit and let their supposed friend make them uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It won't harm you at all to be polite about mail.\n\n***It won't harm Sally at all to be polite about OPs boundary and respect their phobia*** \\- why is the onus on OP to keep the peace at the cost of their own mental and emotional wellbeing simply because *someone else* decided to have a child? \n\nThat isn't how that works - OP is not obligated to subject themselves to the subject of their phobia for someone elses happiness. ***Sally is being a shitty friend by knowingly sending baby photos to someone she is well aware of as being terrified of children*** \\- especially bc OP chose to silently opt out and she is now ignoring that and yet again barging past their entirely reasonable boundaries.", "Apparently no doesn't mean no when it refers to not wanting to be involved with someone's baby.
