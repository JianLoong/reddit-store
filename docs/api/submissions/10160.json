I'm sort of amazed at the irony and lack of self awareness.  You are online talking to people that you have never, and probably will never, meet on the real world. You need to remember that your son probably spent two of his high school years in lockdown.  My kid uses discord to talk to his friends all the time. \n\nYou do sound like what your husband said though. I can imagine you when I was a kid. \n\n\"All these damn kids talking on the phone all day long. Why can't they go down to the Malt Shoppe to socialize like in the Archie\"?", "YTA. \n\nAnd also a hypocrite. You ran to complain about your son's imaginary friends on the internet\u2026 _to a group of imaginary people on the internet._ People you've never been in the same country or room as. \n\nI'm astonished you haven't picked up on the glaring hypocrisy.\n\nYou may need to be surgically removed from Reddit.\n\nEdit: and whether you like it or not, the people he's talking to are \"real\". By referring to them as \"imaginary\" and telling his son to just ditch them, you're being rude to not only your son, but also the people he considers his friends. Yes, he should maybe spend less time attached to his phone, but _also yes,_ those are real, genuine, living human beings with thoughts and feelings of their own. Be less crude and dismissive. It's not a good look on you.\n\nEdit 2: wasn't originally going to say this, but I think it's important as far as proving how \"real\" internet friends are: my \"imaginary friends\" saved me from committing suicide nearly two years ago. I was depressed, I felt alone, I was going through the hardest time of my life to date. They were there for me when my own family wasn't. I had no one, so they stepped up. It's thanks to them that I am no longer suicidal and am here to type this comment.\n\nInternet people are just that: internet **people.**", "yta\n\n...you *are* aware that the people he talks to on discord are real...*right*? they are not imaginary.", "YTA my \u201cimaginary friends\u201d have saved my life more than once.

It is important for futur social skills and general human development imo. HOWEVER, you are going about it completely wrong.
