Sex and botox are not equivalent or similar.", "They are married, legally the car belongs to both of them. As long as she didn\u2019t leave him stranded so he couldn\u2019t get to work he\u2019s the asshole. As a side note, why is he the only one who has a car? Or do they just have one vehicle for both of them and he is further exerting his control by calling it \u201chis\u201d.", "He doesn\u2019t have to, no. But denying her the use of his car to make it harder for her to get botox on her own body for the sole reason of because he doesn\u2019t like her getting botox and wants to make it harder for her to do. That makes him an Asshole", "No he doesn\u2019t need to, true. But: This isn\u2019t \u201cam I obligated\u201d it\u2019s AITA and yeah he is", "Yes, there's no other way there but his car.", "Uh no- they are married. Him refusing the car is controlling. She doesnt have to call an uber- she can just dump his ah self and find someone who isn\u2019t controlling her.", "Or he is mistaken.", "Not in every state.  Some everything you own is community property.  Usually not including inheritances or government benefits.", "fillers and Botox are non-surgical procedures.", "What kind of marriage do you guys know? A car, a house, a pool cleaner.. are things for the family.. provided that you love your family.\n\nSo he is the only one with a car and is his only? Let me guess.. she can use it to pick kids from school and go grocery shopping,.. but god forbid she uses it for something ThE MaN .. forbade.", ">but its not about him denying use of his car.\n\nI see what you're saying and of course he had the right to refuse the use of the car, but this sub isn't \"Am I Technically Legally In The Right\" it's \"Am I the Asshole\". He denied her use of his car specifically to make a statement about what she wanted to do and his disapproval of it. (Also, upon reading the post again I notice it doesn't say she isn't going. Just that she thinks he's a dick. Which he is.)", "The idea that something has a rare side effect must mean using it at 27 is a symptom of underlying psyhcological issues is misogynistic nonsense.

If you don't, you're the asshole.", "You say \"the car\" he says \"my car\" which means it's his and not hers", "If she lies that much he would be better off without her", "Oh yeah and then use the new guys car to get to the Botox appointments right.  Because she couldn\u2019t just be bothered to shell out a few bucks for a taxi.", "What would the correct term be?", "Yeah wow the stigma. Also there are Groupons for Botox and fillers it is not expensive. I agree with Uber but it sounds like op car is the main transit for them both and it's completely unfair to ask partner to Uber because you don't like their haircut (essentially) fillers are cheaper than most hair treatments and last about 6 mo. They are not permanent.", "Well, let's put it another way, let's say she wanted to go on a major shopping spree instead, another costly, non essential trip. Should he be obligated to give up his car for that? Would he be the asshole for saying to take a taxi or whatever to go on a non essential shopping spree? I don't think he would be. And if we reversed the genders, and the husband wanted to go to, lets say, the gym, a non essential thing, would the wife be the asshole for not letting him take her car there? I don't think most people would call her an asshole.\n\nSure, he should give her full use of the car for essential things or things related to the family, such as necessary health appointments, picking the kids up, grocery shopping, trips out as a family, but it doesn't mean he's obligated to do so for non essential things"]}
