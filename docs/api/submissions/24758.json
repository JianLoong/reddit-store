People should respect their hair as it is and care for it well.\"\n\nI can still do it anyway, but if his logic is truly a safety or moral thing, I should probably express counter opinions on why it is safe or moral or whatever. It's worth discussing. \n\nHe can express financial concerns: \"This is expensive and we don't have money for it because of xyz.\"\n\nI could still do it anyway, but he has equal right to money (at least in our relationship).

It\u2019s not my thing but I would never look down on any woman who chooses to do so or think less of them.", "Comparing a vasectomy to Botox is insane", " He absolutely has every right to a vasectomy & doesn't have to tell her. What he does have to deal with,  however, is the consequences of his actions if he ever confesses & it leads to a split.  \n\nHe seems to not want to have a discussion because he's too busy caring about himself & his wants/desires. Even if he approached her differently, if it still came out to only what he wants is not compromise", "No that\u2019s putting no relevance on the situation. If OPS wife was doing something that could permanently affect the way the relationship works then he can be an ass hole. But to be mad at a aging woman for trying to make herself look better, for not only her husband but obviously for herself. Obviously you guys need to educate yourselves on Botox, cause most Botox are just re-administering hydrologic acid, and collagen into the skin. Which are already found in your skin. It\u2019s literally as if you ate dinner but needed more protein so you make a protein shake. But OP is controlling by the way everything is his and about him, you wife is doing it to make herself feel better and I\u2019m sure she does but instead of being happy for her you\u2019re being a sour puss and right AITA on Reddit.", "It\u2019s more analogous to OP wanting to shave off a beard that the spouse likes because spouse finds OP more attractive with a beard. Sure, OP\u2019s spouse can say I don\u2019t like your like without the beard (even then it\u2019s already veering into AH territory) but refusing the use of the car to OP to get to the barber would 100% be AH move.", "I can see you're not actually comparing Botox to a vasectomy in terms of the surgical aspect....but in terms of getting people to think about the whole your body your choice answer. \nIn both cases your body your choice works right.....but not considering your partner in those decisions and doing it anyway could be an AH move. \nIt doesn't matter if it's Botox, or anything else to your body....what matters is how you go about it. \nIf she listened to her partner, considered his concerns, voiced hers and said something like, I appreciate your concerns but this is something  important to me and I will be doing it, instead of the sneaky lying approach. \nOP Not letting her use the car does seem petty. Is this the hill you want to die on? Does the Botox really mean that much to you?", "I reeeeeally hope you stretched before that reach.\n\nComparing botox to vasectomy is absolutely apples to aircraft carriers... \n\nOne involves BOTH PEOPLE and FUTURE PEOPLE. And one is cosmetic that absorbs into the skin...\n\nYou could probably use a checkup with a psychiatrist about something like this... \n\nThis has nothing to do with partnership.", "It sounds like neither of them are willing to make concessions. She's not willing to not undergo lip injection or botox despite her husbands objections, and it sounds like he isn't willing to let her use his car in order to do something he disapproves of. \n\nTime to divorce.", "That is not a cosmetic surgery.", "People blow their money on \u201cstupid shit\u201d all the time. One persons stupid shit is another persons favorite. \nI don\u2019t drink often. IMHO It ages people, a poor way to piss away your money in a very short time. But I don\u2019t tell people to stop.", ">Some of you are so defensive of women it's actually condescending.\n\nThis should be made into a meme for advice subs.", "No it's literally the same behavior she's showing. She is choosing to ignore his stated opinions and doing what she wants, totally her right as an adult. As an adult, he also has the right to say that he's not cool letting her take his car to do the thing that has already caused several fights it sounds like. Without more information it's impossible to say whether it's an ESH or NAH situation.", "So, it's fine for her to do whatever she wants with her body. But he can't do whatever he wants with his vehicle. Got it..", "And there\u2019s nothing wrong with either. People are allowed to control their houses and their cars.", "That\u2019s not how it works tho?", "That's just an assumption.  Legally, I own my car and my wife has no legal claim to it.  Premarital assets are a thing.  My car is 10 years old, I've been with my wife 6 years, paid off my car the summer we met.  We live in a city so one car is plenty.  She has full use of it but legally, it is 100% mine.", "That is absolutely not true. If I drive away in a vehicle registered to my wife, and she reports it stolen, I\u2019m going to jail. If we divorce, they MIGHT consider it joint assets.", "That\u2019s not how it works. Say more words that show you don\u2019t know how it works.", ">They are married, legally the car belongs to both of them\n\nYeah, no, that's not how that works. I'm married and my husband and I have our separate assets accumulated during our marriage. We don't have claim on each other's properties. His cars are his cars; I just drive them.", "Yhea, ummmmm this maybe a shock to you but that\u2019s not how laws work.", "That\u2019s not how that works. Wife is entitled to half of assets. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s straight division. She\u2019s entitled to the value of his personal property.  In the event of in the forest, husband might be able to keep the car in exchange for letting her have 100% of some other item of equivalent value.", "So the 'my body' line is conditional? Interesting.", "Normal 28-year-old women get Botox injections in their foreheads? Unless she suffers from migraines, there is something really wrong with her self-image. That\u2019s an issue in itself.", "Right?! A more reasonable comparison would be if he had a beard and shaved it off even though his wife really hates a clean shaven face. She\u2019s allowed to prefer the beard, but it\u2019s still his face and choice.", "Which is why this is frankly heading to divorce, he can either deal with it or leave. Frankly if she's paying for the injections OP shouldn't give a damn."]}
