She\u2019s a mutual friend amongst my friends, I\u2019ve never met her. She first messaged on Saturday 4th. First of all she asked if she could collect it on Friday (10th), which would be 6 days after initial enquiry. I said that was fine and then she said it would be evening time on that Friday. Again, that would be fine, my little toddlers would be asleep so that\u2019s fine. \n\nI got another message, this is still on the Saturday, saying \u201cactually, maybe I can collect tomorrow. I\u2019ll get my partner to do it after work! I\u2019ll let you know ASAP as busy decorating!\u201d So, again, I\u2019ve let her know that\u2019s fine and i\u2019m happy for her to do and it\u2019s fine if she\u2019s decorating and in a bit of a rush. She said she was busy and I didn\u2019t mind waiting until Friday. She lives a 10min drive from me and I would\u2019ve delivered, but I don\u2019t drive. She then stated that she doesn\u2019t know what time on the Friday now as it\u2019s her eldest\u2019s 3 day birthday weekend.\n\nI even stated, \u201cAny time that day is fine, don\u2019t stress over collection, whenever you\u2019re free!\u201d I was specifically on about timing that day. This then changed to Saturday (11th) collection, I told her, again, that this date is fine and I\u2019ll be cleaning all day so I\u2019m home and not to worry. Saturday 11th comes, she doesn\u2019t pick up the item and I don\u2019t get any messages either. So I figure I\u2019m being messed around. She then messages today (12th) apologising for not collecting the baby crib, that she\u2019s been busy and she\u2019ll have to collect it later next week. \n\nSo I realised, this big bulky item isn\u2019t going to be going any time soon and that she\u2019s messing around. I\u2019d deep cleaned the item, put extra bits with it (blankets and sheets) and also offered it to her for \u00a325. This crib wasn\u2019t a cheap one either. I felt I\u2019d been accommodating enough by this point. So I responded back with, \u201cHi, no worries. I\u2019m needing it out of the house before Monday so I\u2019ll sell it on. Thank you for your interest lovely! X\u201d Well, apparently she wasn\u2019t happy with that. She told me she really needed it and that she only missed one collection day. \n\nMy response was that since her initial enquiry, it\u2019s been 8 days. She originally messaged me on the 4th asking me to keep it on hold for her, so I done just that. She then messages me on the 12th stating that it would be another week away for collecting. \n\nI\u2019m a single mum just selling an item to get it out of my house. Since her initial message I\u2019ve had other people interested and in need of the item and I\u2019ve had to tell them that it\u2019s pending because I put it on hold for her. I didn\u2019t want to wait another week for her to mess me around again, so I sold it on. I was then called an \u2018Absolute Joke\u2019 for doing so. AITA here? I feel bad if she genuinely needed it, but I didn\u2019t want to be messed around anymore than I was?

You are fine.  If she really needed it, she would have picked it up so much sooner and not to drag it out for so many days.\n\nShe didn't even put down deposit so what can she expect??\n\nHowever, I do have a feeling she was trying to drag it out so she could get it free because other potential buyers moved on, lol.", "I have many friends who are antiques dealers or active on FB market - all of them would have been \"NEXT!\" after the extended games this potential buyer played.\n\nIf someone really wants to buy something, they make it happen pronto.\n\nMoving forward, maybe you want to add something like, \"first to show with cash gets it!\"", "NTA at all. \n\nIf she really needed it, she wouldn\u2019t have kept dickering around on the date.
