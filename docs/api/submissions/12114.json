{"id": 12114, "submission_id": "11pcixy", "title": "AITA FOR SELLING ON THE ITEM?", "selftext": "I (24f) listed my son\u2019s baby crib for sale, in my local area, and pretty quickly someone responded asking if they could buy it. She\u2019s a mutual friend amongst my friends, I\u2019ve never met her. She first messaged on Saturday 4th. First of all she asked if she could collect it on Friday (10th), which would be 6 days after initial enquiry. I said that was fine and then she said it would be evening time on that Friday. Again, that would be fine, my little toddlers would be asleep so that\u2019s fine. \n\nI got another message, this is still on the Saturday, saying \u201cactually, maybe I can collect tomorrow. I\u2019ll get my partner to do it after work! I\u2019ll let you know ASAP as busy decorating!\u201d So, again, I\u2019ve let her know that\u2019s fine and i\u2019m happy for her to do and it\u2019s fine if she\u2019s decorating and in a bit of a rush. She said she was busy and I didn\u2019t mind waiting until Friday. She lives a 10min drive from me and I would\u2019ve delivered, but I don\u2019t drive. She then stated that she doesn\u2019t know what time on the Friday now as it\u2019s her eldest\u2019s 3 day birthday weekend.\n\nI even stated, \u201cAny time that day is fine, don\u2019t stress over collection, whenever you\u2019re free!\u201d I was specifically on about timing that day. This then changed to Saturday (11th) collection, I told her, again, that this date is fine and I\u2019ll be cleaning all day so I\u2019m home and not to worry. Saturday 11th comes, she doesn\u2019t pick up the item and I don\u2019t get any messages either. So I figure I\u2019m being messed around. She then messages today (12th) apologising for not collecting the baby crib, that she\u2019s been busy and she\u2019ll have to collect it later next week. \n\nSo I realised, this big bulky item isn\u2019t going to be going any time soon and that she\u2019s messing around. I\u2019d deep cleaned the item, put extra bits with it (blankets and sheets) and also offered it to her for \u00a325. This crib wasn\u2019t a cheap one either. I felt I\u2019d been accommodating enough by this point. So I responded back with, \u201cHi, no worries. I\u2019m needing it out of the house before Monday so I\u2019ll sell it on. Thank you for your interest lovely! X\u201d Well, apparently she wasn\u2019t happy with that. She told me she really needed it and that she only missed one collection day. \n\nMy response was that since her initial enquiry, it\u2019s been 8 days. She originally messaged me on the 4th asking me to keep it on hold for her, so I done just that. She then messages me on the 12th stating that it would be another week away for collecting. \n\nI\u2019m a single mum just selling an item to get it out of my house. Since her initial message I\u2019ve had other people interested and in need of the item and I\u2019ve had to tell them that it\u2019s pending because I put it on hold for her. I didn\u2019t want to wait another week for her to mess me around again, so I sold it on. I was then called an \u2018Absolute Joke\u2019 for doing so. AITA here? I feel bad if she genuinely needed it, but I didn\u2019t want to be messed around anymore than I was?

You tried to accommodate but it didn\u2019t work out. If she truly needed the crib maybe next time she\u2019ll make it a priority to collect things in a timely manner.", "NTA. It's yours, not hers. She's not entitled to it \u2013 she hasn't even paid for it yet.\n\nShe's been messing you around, perhaps unintentionally, but everyone knows it's rude to keep changing the arrangement. After all, you're busy, too.", "NTA, you seem like a very patient and kind person. This person was taking advantage of that. You had an agreed time for her to come pick it up and she missed it. If anything, you should be the one angry at her.", "NTA if she wanted it that badly and urgently, she\u2019d have drove the 10 minutes to pick it up. I understand she may have felt she had first dibs on it, but a week is long enough to wait imo.", "NTA. If she really wanted it, shed have managed to collect it. Its your right to sell to whomever you want. She hadnt put any money down reserving it so it was still technically up for grabs", "NTA. Why couldn't she have driven 10 minutes to pick up the crib, if she desperately needed it?", "NTA. She flaked, you moved on. You gave her a chance to make it right. More than one. That\u2019s the way the game (capitalism) is played.", "NTA - You were really patient and accommodating while she flip flopped about changing days. You held it for her when you could have said whoever comes first gets it. It she was that desperate she would have come and got it straight away. OP you are definitely NTA here.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been more than accommodating and don\u2019t owe her anything. You\u2019ve handled it incredibly well", "NTA - she thought having a mutual friend granted her special privileges to take advantage of your generosity. She was wrong.", "NTA - if she wanted it that badly she would have collected it on any of the days she kept on agreeing to collect.\n\nUsually when I advertise something to sell I tell people I'm not holding onto it and whoever collects forst can have it... Too many people mess around with things like this.", "NTA - She's a joke.", "Nta, the only thing you could have considered is asking for her to already pay for it. So that she is incentivised to actually get it. But NTA whatsoever. I think most people would have sold it after a few days...", "NTA, if she really wanted/needed it she would have picked it up already. It\u2019s your item and you have no obligation to keep holding it for her.", "NTA. You mutually agreed on a day for her to come to collect it. She did not come on that day and didn't message you to explain why she hadnt been able to make it. At that point you were absolutely justified in selling it on.", "NTA She sounds very high maintenance and entitled.", "NTA.  You gave her more than enough time to figure something out.   If she really needed it she'd have found a way.", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you. Sell in on.", "NTA", "NTA the early bird gets the word. if she\u2019s not going to show then she can handle not getting the crib", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you didn't give her plenty of scope.\n\nUnfriend and block her, then live your life.", "NTA. Most vendors in my country wouldn\u2019t even hold on for more than two days especially with no payment. You were very patient", "NTA she has messed you around she is lucky you gave ger as much leeway as you did.", "NTA  She changed collection 6 or 7 times.", "Thank you everyone, I appreciate all of your views. I overthink a lot and I felt really bad, but I didn\u2019t want to keep being messed around. Thank you all x", "NTA. People like her are why sellers won\u2019t hold. And for someone like me who loves out of town it\u2019s tough when a seller won\u2019t hold because I don\u2019t want to risk a long drive just to find an item was sold while I was en route.
