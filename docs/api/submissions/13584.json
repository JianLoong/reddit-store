My husband\n(33) has a younger brother (31) whose he's very close to. However I recently told my husband that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of his brother spending much time with my daughter\nonce she's born. It's not because of my BIL himself. We're not close but he's fine. The issue is his life choices.\n\nHe's not married, has no intention of getting married or having kids, and dates only for sexual purpose. He dates multiple women and the only thing he has in common with them is that, like him, they are extremely good looking. He's highly intelligent, yet he has no interest in meaningful relationships. I spoke to him about his choices a few years ago, and after accusing me of being\n'moralistic', he claims that he always uses protection and he never leads the women on. Which I call BS on, as I can't imagine\nany woman with an increasing ticking biological clock would willingly be in a relationship which she knows doesn't have a future. Not to mention, what woman would want to be with someone\nwho may not even remember your name in a year's time?\n\nI mentioned this to my husband, however he called me an AH, and said that it was ridiculous to limit our daughter's access with her uncle just because I don't agree with his legal dating choices.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I probably should have clarified that he generally goes onto apps like Tinder. Which makes it worst, as the women he dates tend to be of a certain type.", "created_utc": 1680204376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126wpy0/aita_for_wanting_to_limit_my_bils_access_to_my/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What about the teacher who cheats, the dance teacher who's gay, the daycare worker who loves to party?\n\nThis isn't about his dating life. This is about jealousy and envy. He's got a life of freedom you resent, so you want to kick him in the shins.  \n\nYour husband and his family are seeing this as a huge red flag. How many other red flags are you flying?

If he's happy with it, why should you care?\n\nYes, there are women who enjoy non-committed relationships (especially right after their divorce). Not all women want to have children either, so that \"ticking biological clock\" isn't a concern.

You claim he talks about your life choices yet you are on Reddit speaking about his which I am going to assume he has not done. This is the pot calling the kettle black. Just because he has no kids or plans on it does not mean he is not capable of being a loving person in any child\u2019s life and an excellent added value.
