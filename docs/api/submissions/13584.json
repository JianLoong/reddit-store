My husband\n(33) has a younger brother (31) whose he's very close to. However I recently told my husband that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of his brother spending much time with my daughter\nonce she's born. It's not because of my BIL himself. We're not close but he's fine. The issue is his life choices.\n\nHe's not married, has no intention of getting married or having kids, and dates only for sexual purpose. He dates multiple women and the only thing he has in common with them is that, like him, they are extremely good looking. He's highly intelligent, yet he has no interest in meaningful relationships. I spoke to him about his choices a few years ago, and after accusing me of being\n'moralistic', he claims that he always uses protection and he never leads the women on. Which I call BS on, as I can't imagine\nany woman with an increasing ticking biological clock would willingly be in a relationship which she knows doesn't have a future. Not to mention, what woman would want to be with someone\nwho may not even remember your name in a year's time?\n\nI mentioned this to my husband, however he called me an AH, and said that it was ridiculous to limit our daughter's access with her uncle just because I don't agree with his legal dating choices.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I probably should have clarified that he generally goes onto apps like Tinder.

He's got a life of freedom you resent, so you want to kick him in the shins.  \n\nYour husband and his family are seeing this as a huge red flag. How many other red flags are you flying?

You claim he talks about your life choices yet you are on Reddit speaking about his which I am going to assume he has not done. This is the pot calling the kettle black. Just because he has no kids or plans on it does not mean he is not capable of being a loving person in any child\u2019s life and an excellent added value.

My aunt is unmarried.\n\nShe was always there for me. Not that my parents weren't great. They were. But this woman prioritized me in her life. She let me know that not only did my parents love and care for me but that she did too. She was one of a community of people that helped me grow. A very important one. \n\nWhen I didn't know what to do with my life she gave me advice. She helped me handle finances when it was cringe to talk to my parents about money. She fostered my interest in travel and culture. She listened to my problems and celebrated my successes  She showed me that I was an interesting and compelling individual that was worth investing time with. \n\nAnother positive thing that was modeled for me especially as a young girl was that I didn't need to be married and beholden to someone to be happy and have value. I was enough just as myself. I remember dating this loser in highschool. He was cool so I felt cool dating him. But he treated me like dirt. My friends made excuses. My parents made it clear they didn't like him. But I was like 17 who cares what my parents think?\n\nI remember going to her to vent after an incident. Of course she said the things any normal adult would say : he was treating me poorly and I could do better. That I shouldn't let someone treat me like that. I left her house frustrated. The adults just didn't understand!!! But I remember crying myself to sleep that night upset. And I remember having a revelation: maybe aunt was right. She didn't need a cool boyfriend to be cool. She was the cool one. She didn't have to let toxic people in because she was cool enough on her own. \n\nYTA OP. You want to limit the love and family your daughter can have in her life. You want to limit the community of individuals that can enrich her life. Because you don't agree with his choice to be single and you have misogynist views of women. There is nothing wrong with someone in your daughters life modeling a happy successful life without a partner. In fact it's a wonderful thing to be exposed to.\n\nYou're also probably going to hurt your marriage. You're going to be creating friction in your husband's family. How do you expect your husband to maintain a relationship with his family and his brother if they have to hide from your daughter.\n\nNot to mention how your toxic beliefs about women could affect your daughter as she grows up to be a woman herself. She might need someone around that realizes women are more than just housewives and baby machines.", "Internalised?", "Also her sex life.", "I completely agree, but it's more than just sex. She's devaluing his morals because they don't align with hers.\n I remember being in my 20s and the constant nagging from everyone. \"You need to find a nice guy.\" Why aren't you dating/married?\"I can introduce you to someone.\" Like, I couldn't be single and happy on my own. Then \"when are you getting married?\"You should get pregnant.\"Don't you want kids?\" It's like no no and NO. I'm a woman, and I wanted marriage and kids. But I also wanted freedom and time and to be my own person. Also, all of that is so over rated like come on, we get to live so much longer now. What is the rush? Personally, I purposely told everyone, \"No, I don't want to get married or have kids.\" The faces people made or questioning looks were worth it. If I had been honest, it would have just continued with the nagging. I did get married and have a kid. But I took my time, I made choices, and I had fun. There is nothing wrong with not wanting those things until you are ready or if you never want them. Judging someone because they want something different is bs. Sleeping around or having fun relationships is no one's business but the people involved. It just sounds like OP is just jealous of her BIL's freedom and sex life. She needs to look at herself and question if she really understands her choices. Is she happy with herself, her life, her sex life, and her choices? Does she enjoy her sex life? If so, why can't her BIL? If not, doesn't that mean there's a bigger problem? Does she believe women can enjoy sex? Would she force her daughter into a loveless marriage just because she's a female? Is her daughter sex life or enjoyment of sex going to bother her? Sex is completely natural, and everyone does it. There's no shame in it. So why judge. Also, what if her daughter doesn't want kids? Would she disown her daughter for not wanting them or thinking differently?\nSorry I rambled.", "I spat out my water that I was drinking everywhere from laughing when I read this comment. Bravo and thank you.", "I hate to know what she thinks about pan/bisexuals.

I reeeally wanted to read your comment after the first sentence or two, but then I saw the giant WALL OF TEXT! But, if the rest of that wall aligns with the first 2 sentences, I wholeheartedly agree!", "I met mine while tailgating at a weekend long rock concert ten years ago.  I would like OP to please explain why this is somehow the superior way to find a partner?  I want a full itemized list of pros and cons here.", "I just realized that outside of campy adventure novels or books emulating them, this is the first time I've seen this use of rake, bravo", "I mean, it is slightly disheartening as a 35 year old woman, pregnant with my second, being referred to as a \u201cgeriatric pregnancy\u201d.  The medical community really needs to come up with a different term for pregnant woman over 35.  It made me feel very\u2026well\u2026old.", "/clutches pearls", "Only people who feel limited and trapped, then decide to breed because they are desperate for some meaning in their lives\ud83d\ude44.\n\nI cannot with this OP.", "Damn. I am so sorry for your family.  I am by no means stupid, (perhaps debatable to some./s) but I wish I had the drive and dedication to accomplish something like that.  They are foolish to not realize how amazing your accomplishment is. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with prioritizing education over settling down/children if that what speaks to you. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with doing having it all.  If your degree scares men off, good! It\u2019ll scare off the ones who don\u2019t deserve/respect you anyway. Saves you some inconvenience and time. What I\u2019m trying to say is, I\u2019m a mom, although not your mom, and I\u2019m proud of you.", "I had an art teacher, who would always tell us about her sister, who would call her to complain about her children. Then immediately ask her when she was having kids.  My art teachers take on the matter was that her sister \u201cjust wanted to share the misery.\u201d", "THIS! My responsible adult children bring me so much joy!", "You sound like an AH and jealous tbh lol", "Sounds like dad may balance OP out.  He thinks his brother is perfectly fine and isn\u2019t going for the limiting access stuff", "Hahaha, love this. She obviously only has sex to get pregnant. Her poor husband.", "Not only do many of us not want kids, but some of us don't want the OP's definition of a 'proper' relationship either!  It took years for me to figure out that I'm not broken, I'm just aromantic.  I have zero interest in romantic relationships, but if I can find purely sexual ones, I'm in!  The problem is that it's always been the men who catch feelings and try to get me to change my mind.  The fact that the BIL is upfront with these women makes his choices A-OK to me.  The OP needs to get off her high horse.", "Take it from a former evangelical, 75% of those Christian mingle girls will do literally ANYTHING. The other 25% will do literally nothing. \ud83d\ude02", "Oof my condolences. I grew up with Christian conservatives too but don't have a sister so that would make sense.", "This!! I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one. I adore my husband, and he adores me.

The number of comments I get about \u201cjust wait till the honeymoon phase wears off, then your husband will annoy you too\u201d. \nA group of women in my office would always stand around bitching about how shitty their husbands are, and I got looked at like I was an alien when I praised mine because well, he\u2019s awesome.", "Society tends to focus on romantic love type of relationships as the most important and valuable type of connection, the source of true happiness. So everyone is obsessively trying to find the right person to share their life with when so many people probably would be happier being single but just having sexual relationships if/when they want it. I think a lot of people enjoy the freedom and lack of compromise involved in sharing your life with someone, but somehow it's seen as pathetic or lacking in real value. Which is a shame.", "I'm awaiting a surgery date, I'm absolutely excited!", "Well she\u2019s pregnant so she\u2019s probably decided sex is a no now until it\u2019s time to procreate again.", "Same.
