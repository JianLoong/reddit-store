They were barking at random hours sometimes and yes, as they were tiny they did alert a break-in at one point. Years passed by, dogs changed, always outdoor dogs. We had a big fenced garden, so there was a lot of freedom. They had an insulated doghouse, covers and a special shed (that could be warmed if it was too cold) with a door the cat/dog would use. So all in all they were covered against bad weather. I wasn't even thinking it would be possible for a dog to stay indoors more than a couple of hours for new years day or during sickness. Then it came a time my family went on holiday, not even the first time, they took a dogsitter (as they always did) who could walk their dog twice a day and keep it out for about 12hrs, after that she would be take the dog in with her at night. Well this habit was followed up, some people showed up after the dogsitter left in the morning, but before she came back and started to play with the dog, find toys and stuff, until one day they straight out took the dog away and we never seen or heard from it again. I recall starting a full on hunt on social media and local newspapers, obsession mode. People took immediately the racist explanation after the news break, a few days after, that the local police discovered a foreign clan stealing dogs for eating purposes (?) Another person speculated that it could be about another ethnic group, and lastly (more likely) went towards a local neighbor with family in the city that wanted a tiny dog for their grandchildren. Unfortunately there was little to do, the dog never escaped nor have ever been found. The dog was registered, but the chip had never been scanned. Moral of the story: keep your dogs close. Walk them regularly, but never take them for granted, they love and trust us, they deserve to live in a safe and assisted environment at any time. If you don't have time for a dog, then don't get a dog. \"Outdoor dogs\" it's not a thing. Also I had to put my fb account in bleach as the people who constantly contacted me (up until 6-8 months after) were all about what kind of minority groups they think did the steal and why, yet never even considered the likely culprit lived there all his life (just a old guy with little means, that used to do those kind of things in his youth). \n\nSo, NTA.
