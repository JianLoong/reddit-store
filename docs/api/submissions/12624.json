I always let her borrow my clothes.\n\nWe had a huge fight that might need some explanation to understand. \n\nKelly was dating a boy \"Harry\" (m20) they dated for around two years. They broke off a few months ago. Harry is a good friend of my older brother so I still see him regularly. Well, he invited me out and at first I said no because I thought Kelly wouldn't like it. But then my friends group had a convo about how someone shouldn't get angry when another person dates their ex because an ex is not someone's property. So I thought it was ok then to date Harry.\n\nWe have been dating for a couple months now. I'm rather private about my dating life, so our relationship was a secret. 3 weeks ago we had a date in a cafe and some other friend saw us and sent Kelly a photo of us.\n\nShe was definitely not okay with it at all. She yelled at me and called me a bitch and a hoe for sleeping with her ex. I told her that once you break up you don't get to own the person, but she told me that was shit. Then she told me that she never wanted to see me again or continue being my friend. Even though I tried to speak with her, she just ignored me. \n\nOkay now the problem we had is that I tried to give her some space so maybe she'll see that she was exaggerating in cutting me off, I had the hope that she would at least be willing to talk to me again but no. I wanted my stuff back, I knew that she wouldn't have dropped them off at my house if I asked, so instead I texted her mom and told her that I needed to pick some stuff that Kelly had borrowed from me. I told her that Kelly wouldn't like to see me, so if she could message me when she wasn't home so I can pick my stuff. \n\nShe did as she promised and texted me yesterday that Kelly had left and that I could go pick my stuff. Harry was with me and as I was gonna need help (it was a lot of stuff) I asked him to come. We got there, we greeted her mom and then we went to Kelly's room to pick my stuff. Harry and I took some stuff and were about to leave when Kelly got home. She started yelling at us and asked us what we were doing there. I calmly explained that I needed my stuff back but we were already leaving. She started yelling again and she ended up telling me I was an asshole for even showing at her house without her knowing, she also got in a bit of an argument with her mom because she let us in. We left after that.\n\nWhen we got home I was very affected by all this, so we told my mom what happened. She scolded me and told me that she could've picked my stuff if I asked so we could avoid problems. She told me that if Kelly set a boundary about not wanting to see me anymore then I should've respected that and shouldn't have gone to her house and get her mom in trouble too.

Lesson learned.", "YTA taking her ex to her place and into her bedroom without her knowledge or consent.", "YTA\n\nIf she was your best friend you shouldn't have dated her ex. He's not her property, sure, but she was your best friend and that was a huge betrayal of your friendship.\n\nFurther, you weren't up front about it. Even if dating this guy meant so much to you that you were willing to damage your friendship, a conversation ahead of time would have been warranted. \n\nIf you had things at her place that you wanted back, you were absolutely out of line in going into her space to retrieve them while she wasn't home - Even more so for bringing your boyfriend/her ex with you. Her mother was out of line for allowing this as well. You should have asked her to gather your items and arranged a time to pick them up, and if you needed help, you should have brought someone else.", "YTA. You know what you did. \nBest friends exs so close after a break up are off limits and then to take him to her home in her room.\nStay away from she doesn\u2019t need a person like you as her friend", "YTA. Why did you have to date him? I just wonder? There are literally so many men. As a matter of fact, you could have chosen anyone. Why him? If you guys broke up, would you really be cool with it if a friend from your group gets with him? Honestly?", "YTA on a bunch of levels. \n\nYou believed that a group of friends talking about hypothetical scenarios and behavior gave you permission to do what you knew was not acceptable behavior amongst most friends. \n\nYou didn\u2019t talk to your friend when you did have intentions of dating her ex to see how she felt about it. \n\nYou went into her space without her permission. \n\nYou *brought her ex into her space*, because you \u201cneeded help\u201d - unless you were picking up actual furniture you didn\u2019t need help. Your arms aren\u2019t broken. You can make multiple trips. I suspect it was easier to have help.\n\nWhich may sum up your behavior. It\u2019s easier not to ask your close friend how she feels about you dating her ex before you do it. It\u2019s easier to keep the relationship private so it\u2019s not scrutinized. It\u2019s easier to arrange with her mom a time to pick up your things instead of facing your friend or finding an arrangement that respects boundaries. It\u2019s easier to get help picking up your stuff than doing it on your own.\n\nIs doing the easy thing your pattern? I don\u2019t know. But it certainly led to some lapses in judgment.", "Wow. YTA. She will never speak to you again. Hope this dude is the love of your life and you stay together forever to at least make it somewhat worth it. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if the rest of your friends decide to ghost you over this, too. You clearly don\u2019t honor girl code.", "YTA. I would never date my friend's ex, but I agree he is not her property. However, you were wrong for keeping a secret. It is less the fact you dated him, but more the fact you kept acting like a secret and was *never* upfront with her.

This was a 2 year relationship! That is automatically off limits for any friend nevermind a best friend.\n\nYou started hooking up 2 months after their breakup?? Now if this was 10 years later your argument about not owning people might stick but 2 months is too fresh to cross that boundary. \n\nBest friends don't hide relationships from eachother so hiding a 3 wk one from her tells me you know you are wrong. \n\nLastly, I get wanting your personal shit back but you absolutely crossed the line going behind her back with her mom.... especially bringing the boyfriend. There were so many other options for help. \n\nYou don't deserve her forgiveness or her friendship. YTA", "YTA", "Wow.

You knew that dating your best friends ex was a bad idea from the get go.  You knew she would flip her shit which is why you kept it secret for months.  You knew she would be angry at you showing up at her home.\n\nYou are like a real life troll.  Just being shitty to be shitty.", "YTA.\n\nSure, I can see how you'd think that an ex isn't someone's property but what you decided to do was date your friends ex behind her back because you knew that was a shady thing to do.\n\nYou chose a guy over years of friendship and instead of just fessing up and asking for your stuff back first, you waited for her to be gone, involved her mom and went to her home with her ex in tow and I just can't see how you don't see how gross of a friend you are being, due to the logic that you aren't in the wrong.\n\nYou dating a guy isn't what's wrong here, it's your actions and hiding that shit from a \"friend\". Also, what sort of guy goes and dates a friend of a girl he had previously been with, without even being open and honest about it with the previous girl? You two really deserve each other.

Of course she was upset.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't enter someones room without permission by that person!!! Especially not with that persons ex. That's creepy and intruding. \n\nYou don't date your best friends ex without permission! How can you not understand that? In bigger circles yes, when people only spend time with each other when bigger things happens and several people are there. But best friends spend time with each other both with boyfriends and without. But now you just had to torture her by chosen her ex instead of her. Even though you knew that it would hurt her.

Your best friend breaks up with her ex and instead of being there for her, you date her ex behind her back? How would you feel if she did that to you. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re a huge AH for going over to her house with the ex-boyfriend to pick up your stuff. You just dredged up all that old trauma when you could have easily just had someone else go pick up the stuff.", "YTA!!! You have some serious growing up to do. You owe Kelly and her mom both a serious apology. You are extremely selfish.", "YTA. They were together for 2 years and almost as soon they broke up you were dating him. That goes against the \"friend code.\"  Maybe many months or a year or two down the line but not immediately. It DOES make you look bad...like you were already messing around with him before they broke up or you were waiting to swoop in on him. Either way...that doesn't paint you in a very nice light. The fact that you felt the need to be incognito about it tells me that you already knew this. \n\nBut the relationship aside, your mom is very much correct. You had no business or right going into her space without her knowledge, consent or presence and unless you were bringing down a steamer trunk, there was absolutely ZERO reason to bring Harry with you. Imagine coming home to find your recent ex, and the person who's bed he jumped into immediately after, rummaging around in YOUR safe and private space? Handling your things, going through your drawers and closet. Opening things. Moving things. To say she had to be feeling extremely vulnerable,  betrayed and violated would be the understatement of the century....and that you went over her head to her mother, someone she is supposed to trust, makes it even worse. \n\nThere are a million different ways you could have gotten your things back without completely violating her privacy and boundaries. A mutual friend, asking her mother to ask her to bag your things to pick up. Your mother going over to request them. \n\nYou are young. So I'm going to give you a little bit of sage advice. There is a term for jumping right into a new,  intimate relationship immediately after a long term relationship ends: Rebound. You are the rebound girl, my dear. And you also have the unfortunate situation of being the rebound girl to your best friends ex. I hate to break it to you but you destroyed a long term friendship...a friendship that would have lasted far longer than this relationship...because statistically, rebound relationships rarely last.\n\n Getting into a new relationship before you have processed, grieved, healed and moved on from the last one is not a good idea because that process doesn't disappear just because you have someone there to fulfill your immediate physical, social and emotional needs. Once the newness of the relationship wears off, they usually find that the rebound person isn't actually someone they want to stay with long term. They were just someone to make the transition easier.\n\nOne thing is certain, though. You have just torpedoed your friendship so you need to BACK OFF. Maybe she will come around but she probably won't. And I hate to say it, but you are probably going to lose other friendships as well.", "YTA. Your friend group has one convo on how dating friend\u2019s exes is ok, so then you take that as approval to date your best friend\u2019s ex? Drop that friend group, no sense of loyalty.

Hugely. *Of course* an ex isn\u2019t someone\u2019s property and *of course* they can\u2019t continue to control their ex. But obviously you\u2019re prioritizing your feelings over your friends.

Then you acted all surprised and blamed her for being upset.  Lastly, she said she didn't want to see you and you 'decided' not to ask for your stuff back from her, so you went around her and went to her mother.

Sure, it definitely can be, but not when you sneak around like a rat trying to hide it from them. You lied about said relationship instead of being upfront with your friend. You threw away a lifelong friendship for a relationship with a boy that is statistically unlikely to last.\n\nYou disregarded her boundaries and went digging around her room without her knowledge or consent. And the fact on top of all of that you snuck her ex into her room too? Absolutely despicable. That is such an invasion of privacy and incredibly disrespectful. \n\nIf you can\u2019t see how any of this is wrong you need to do some serious soul-searching.

People are nuanced and complex. It\u2019s easy to say that once someone breaks up with their partner that they should just get over it and suppress their emotions, but that is just not the reality.

I always let her borrow my clothes.\n\nWe had a huge fight that might need some explanation to understand. \n\nKelly was dating a boy \"Harry\" (m20) they dated for around two years. They broke off a few months ago. Harry is a good friend of my older brother so I still see him regularly. Well, he invited me out and at first I said no because I thought Kelly wouldn't like it. But then my friends group had a convo about how someone shouldn't get angry when another person dates their ex because an ex is not someone's property. So I thought it was ok then to date Harry.\n\nWe have been dating for a couple months now. I'm rather private about my dating life, so our relationship was a secret. 3 weeks ago we had a date in a cafe and some other friend saw us and sent Kelly a photo of us.\n\nShe was definitely not okay with it at all. She yelled at me and called me a bitch and a hoe for sleeping with her ex. I told her that once you break up you don't get to own the person, but she told me that was shit. Then she told me that she never wanted to see me again or continue being my friend. Even though I tried to speak with her, she just ignored me. \n\nOkay now the problem we had is that I tried to give her some space so maybe she'll see that she was exaggerating in cutting me off, I had the hope that she would at least be willing to talk to me again but no. I wanted my stuff back, I knew that she wouldn't have dropped them off at my house if I asked, so instead I texted her mom and told her that I needed to pick some stuff that Kelly had borrowed from me. I told her that Kelly wouldn't like to see me, so if she could message me when she wasn't home so I can pick my stuff. \n\nShe did as she promised and texted me yesterday that Kelly had left and that I could go pick my stuff. Harry was with me and as I was gonna need help (it was a lot of stuff) I asked him to come. We got there, we greeted her mom and then we went to Kelly's room to pick my stuff. Harry and I took some stuff and were about to leave when Kelly got home. She started yelling at us and asked us what we were doing there. I calmly explained that I needed my stuff back but we were already leaving. She started yelling again and she ended up telling me I was an asshole for even showing at her house without her knowing, she also got in a bit of an argument with her mom because she let us in. We left after that.\n\nWhen we got home I was very affected by all this, so we told my mom what happened. She scolded me and told me that she could've picked my stuff if I asked so we could avoid problems. She told me that if Kelly set a boundary about not wanting to see me anymore then I should've respected that and shouldn't have gone to her house and get her mom in trouble too.

People are explaining, and you\u2019re still not getting it.", "You honestly thought that she wouldn't notice a bunch of stuff missing from her room?", "Boy, you sure showed me for giving some compassion to a kid that isn\u2019t even in her 20s, knowing that the people in this sub were going to tear her a new one. \n\nYour way is so much better. I should start assuming I know ever gd thing too. Gotta be freeing to not be constrained by unknowns.", "Right? Gotta love Reddit.", "Bingo. You\u2019re absolutely right.  \n\nOP heard that SOMEONE ELSE(S) thought it doesn\u2019t matter and is applying that \u201clogic\u201d to her \u201cbest friend\u201d- well THEY don\u2019t think it matters so YOU shouldn\u2019t think it matters, and I\u2019m right because he\u2019s HOOOOOOOOT!\n\nEw. So gross. \n\nAnd then, to add more insult to more injury of her bestie dating her ex behind her back for MONTHS, they intrude into her safe space to rummage through her belongings?! IDGAF if every item you owned was over there. \n\nOnce it\u2019s no longer in your possession, you no longer own it, right?? Or does that only apply to boyfriends up for OP to date behind someone\u2019s back??", "So? She's still part of your friend group if you all sometimes hang out. She's not a person you have issues with who was just trying to cause trouble. That's two people so far amongst your friends who think what you did was fucked up. And I doubt you've bothered actually talking to the others, due to the shadiness and selfishness you display. So you can't say that your friends don't believe in the girl code, since there is clear evidence they do. YOU just don't lol. At least not while you're the one dating exes, we'll see how you feel when the \"boy\" starts dating one of your friends after y'all break up! And it's very much in line with a narcissist to assume that because it's ok with you, it should be ok with everyone, which is exactly what you're doing.", "Because you seem offended that she is mad at you for it even though you didn't even have the decency to have a proper conversation with her about it. Would it have killed you to give her a heads up? Imagine how she felt finding out from someone that wasn't you.\n\nYou engaged in snake behaviour and you are upset that people are calling you out for it\n\nETA: With friends like you, who needs enemies?", "Ok but you shouldn\u2019t be surprised she\u2019s mad and will hopefully never forgive you.", "In that case, you're right, she didn't have a \"claim\" to him, but you should have discussed it with her before you started dating and definitely shouldn't have let her ex into her bedroom.", "Any reason you just had to bring your ex and just couldn't wait another few hours until someone else could help you? Or just do it yourself?", "But this isn\u2019t just any relationship. It\u2019s her ex boyfriend of two years!! No matter what you guys say she\u2019s going to think you guys were hooking up while they were still together. \n\nWhy did they break up?", "I don't buy this. I think you know what you're doing is wrong, and you're just using this as an excuse. I hope this relationship is worth it because you definitely burned a bridge with your friend. Or should I say ex friend. I can guarantee that once your friend starts telling the group about your actions, you're not going to have any friends at all because they won't trust you. Btw, YTA", "Pathetic excuse.\n\nThe fact that you can't distinguish between giving intimate details on your relationships and giving a friend a heads-up about their ex pursuing you says a lot about you as a person, and none of it good.", "As I stated above, you don\u2019t have to like or respect that rule, but you do have to deal with the consequences of ignoring it.", "They broke off because they both didn't loved each other anymore, it's not like he broke off with her but she still loves him.", "I don't think it's my place to let her mom know what happened between us. If she wanted her mom to know than she would've told her herself.", "When he asked me out but I said no they had broken off two months ago, we started dating a month after that.", "And what about the compassion for her friend? Imagine your best friend you've known since recess, the same friend you went through the super awkward middle school years with, the same friend you survived highschool with and even celebrated graduation with and witnessed the end of a multiple year long relationship that ended on very bad terms. Then you one day find out that same friend is dating that person you ended the relationship with and no not by your best friend coming and speaking to you but by someone sending you a photo of them together. Do you realize how heartbreaking that would be to a 19 year old? So excuse me if I'm having difficulty having compassion for OP. \n\nAnd your ignoring the part she didn't make a one type lapse of judgement. She deliberately chose to hide her relationship from her closest friend. That's a serious of lies and deception spanning months. That's not a simple mistake, that's a large amount of decisions that lead her here. Then to top it all off knowing all this she decides to ask her current BF and friends ex to go to the house with her? Did she have no one else in her life to ask? In what world would anyone want their ex snooping through their room after that mess break up?\n\nAlthough I will agree that this sub can get pretty damn vicious and brutal. I will say however this sub can sometimes be a hard reality check that is needed.", "Her mom told us she didn't knew how long it would be until Kelly came back and I wanted to take the stuff when she wasn't home to avoid any more drama. \n\nThere were a lot of stuff, I even had to leave some at her place. I let her borrow my stuff all the time but she barely ever gave it back to me if I didn't asked for them (which I rarely did). There were clothes and shoes. I needed help to get that stuff back to the car.", "They broke off because they just didn't loved each other. They had some problems last year, she had to have a medical intervention and after that their relationship wasn't the same. They decided to break up because the relationship wasn't good anymore.", "You have to deal with all sorts of outcomes, including those of getting unreasonable people to be mad at you. It is up to you if you want to please everyone or to stand your ground, even at the cost someone will be mad at you.", "I think you are good then. (And you would be even if it wasn't the case, if  you didn't actively seduce him while he was still with her, which you didn't). NAH", "If this is the case you have the weirdest fucking boundaries. That\u2019s the boundary of all of this that made sense to you? Lie to us, the massive void, but be fucking honest with yourself. You\u2019re never going to grow from this if you aren\u2019t.\n\nCould it have been you didn\u2019t tell her mom because it was easier not to?", "You paraded her daughter's ex around, in front of her. I think it's safe to say you're looking at what's 'your place' in the rear view mirror.", "She probably doesn't want to see or have to hear about her ex every time she hangs out with you, I certainly wouldn't.", "How very noble of you /s", "Two years vs 3 months. Guuuurl you nasty", "Her friend didn\u2019t post here. I have plenty of compassion for her. More so actually. But you of course assume I don\u2019t. I have no idea why. It\u2019s not like my judgment or my compassion lets her off the hook somehow.\n\nIt is humanly possible to have compassion for both of them. You understand that, right? Or maybe you just think I\u2019m wrong for expressing it? Or maybe it makes you feel like a bad person because you can\u2019t find room in your heart to be compassionate to someone that\u2019s done what she has?\n\nI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t fucking care. I\u2019m not going to debate with you who is and isn\u2019t worthy of compassion.\n\nGood day.", "You obviously didn't succeed if avoiding drama was the goal. Her mom could have helped carry. You could have had Kelly box it up and you pick it up. Take multiple trips. There's a dozen different ways you could have done it without Harry. Even if you needed to wait a day or two.", "So you still think that made it ok to date her ex? Did you honestly think she\u2019d be ok with that or would still want to be friends with you?", "So when he dumps you in the future and goes after another one of your friends, it\u2019s gonna be all good?", "What do you mean by medical intervention? I interpreted it as a pregnancy loss and if that's the case asshole doesn't cover it.", "So, I\u2019m sick and in bed today, and have way too much time on my hands. Thus, I read some of your recent comments. You seem like a very reasonable person, so may I ask why you feel so strongly about this particular \u201crule\u201d? It seems fairly evident to me that taking up with a close friend\u2019s ex so close to the end of that relationship is both violating, and massively disrespectful to said friend\u2019s feelings. What\u2019s your reasoning?", "Not once did I say you can't have compassion for her I said I don't. Everyone has their own opinion and feelings you are free to hold compassion for both of them but I do not. I thought this was a discussion not a debate but either way she didn't come here for compassion she came here for a judgement. Either way have a good weekend.", "Well yes, we spoke about how a person can't stop their friends to date their ex", "She's been ignoring this question anytime it's asked", "You're not so far off. It was an unwanted pregnancy, they both decided to have an abortion. After that things got weird between them and they stopped loving each other.", "I am perhaps too rational but I think that if you break up with someone that it's the end of your romantic relationship. It means you no longer want to be their partner, and both of you are free to find another partner. This is no one's fault, and it is actually a good thing you do not block a person who is not a good fit for you, and vice versa. Why should you be mad if that person you no longer want finds someone who can be a better fit for them?\n\nI'd understand that you'd be mad if the partner cheated on you, but if either of you ended the relationship, it's over, and you do not have any \"rights\" towards this person anymore.  I think that if you want to exert them after the breakup, you are sort of labelling the person as \"your possession\" that should not be taken although you had already \"discarded\" it, and this is likely the aspect that bothers me most.\n\nOh, and get well soon, being sick sucks :-(", "You\u2019re a horrible friend. Hope he was worth losing a friendship. They may not have been \u201cin love\u201d anymore but there\u2019s still history. And there\u2019s still feelings. Yeah she doesn\u2019t have any claim or ownership over him and just because they\u2019re not together anymore doesn\u2019t make the breakup any less devastating. How could she get over the feelings when you\u2019re with him? And how can she get over the good times knowing he\u2019s with her supposed best friend?", "I noticed she\u2019d dodged it a few times but seen she\u2019s still been commenting recently. Hopefully pointing it out will at least make her see it and think about it, even if she\u2019s too much of a coward to address it right now.", "This has to be fake. I refuse to believe you would actually be that cruel to a lifelong friend, especially if you expect her to be fine with it.", "I get this, but this take assumes that all breakups are mutual and amicable. They\u2019re often not, and even when they are, it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t hurt. In my eyes, dating your friends ex is just rubbing salt in the wound. \n\nAnyway, just my response take.\n\nThanks! I think it\u2019s a fast moving virus, at least.", "I can see where you are coming from, and I am aware that my take is purely rational, and  that you cannot take emotions out from human relations. \n\nI can see from the emotional point of view how it can hurt that someone you love does not love you back, although rationally it does not make sense - you cannot force a feeling out of someone, and what point would there be in dating someone who is not interested in you? If it is the other way round and it was you who feels you do not want to be with this person anymore, wouldn't breaking up be the most natural thing to do?\n\nI get it that it would be more hurtful if it was the guy who broke up with OP's friend and she was still in love with him but OP says that it was  not the case and that it was mutual. So why should there be any hard feelings? OP's friend herself acknowledged that this guy is not for her, why should it hurt her if he finds a better match? OP did not betray anyone.\n\nBut I think we can agree to disagree here, people are different and react in different ways, and there is not only one proper rule how this should be dealt with."]}
