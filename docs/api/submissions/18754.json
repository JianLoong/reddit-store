He has a three year old and a four year old with his ex girlfriend and has full custody, she gets them every other weeken. I met his kids a year ago and have been building a relationship with them. We\u2019re both 23 and young but we\u2019re both mature and stable, he owns his own house and business and I am in sonography school. We openly talk about marriage and are planning to elope on his birthday this summer and have been wearing wedding bands. Since we\u2019re going straight to marriage I never called him my fiance nor announced it online, only close friends and family know we\u2019re getting married. We\u2019ve also talked about me adopting his kids one day.\n\n\nI have a cousin whom I grew up with and we were really close when we were younger but grew apart during high school. Shes adopted by my aunt and uncle. At a family gathering a few days ago we ran into each other after not seeing each other for almost two years. Since we\u2019re the closest cousins in age there we were talking the whole time. It was awkward. She asks about my boyfriend and I was talking about our upcoming elopement and other things she screws up her face and says she didnt know he has kids. I tell her he has two and she has a look of shock and disgust on her face. She tells me Im too young to be playing stepmom and that Im wasting my life if I marry him. I was shocked at her rudeness and tell her that I love my stepkids and I\u2019d rather be with my boyfriend than anyone else.\n\n \nShe says that she could never sit and pretend to love a child for a man and that she could never love a child that wasnt \u201creally hers\u201d. I bit my tongue at that since shes literally adopted and from what my mom has told me, was only adopted because my aunt is infertile and it was something she had to talk her husband into since he was unsure. I reply and said Im not pretending anything and that of course it took time to build a bond with them and I understand if she wouldnt do it. \n\n\nShe just looks me up and down and says Im too pretty to resort to being a \u201cglorified babysitter\u201d and that shes gonna find it funny in ten years to watch my stepchildren disrespect me at family events and yell that Im not their \u201creal mom\u201d and that theyre not technically lying. I told her that once I legally adopt them they\u2019ll be my children and she had the nerve to scoff. I was shocked at her audacity and asked her if she forgot SHES adopted herself. She got irate saying a couple adopting a baby TOGETHER is not the same thing as a desperate person playing stepmom and adopting kids that already have a mom and Ill never be their real mom. I said then I guess youre not MY aunts real child than. She started crying and left sobbing. When I tried explaining what happened everyone said I was wrong and that I shouldnt have brought her adoption up for question and Im a major asshole and that adopting a baby as a couple is not the same as adopting your partners kids. Theyre saying I have to apologize.

She would have to sever her parental rights for you to adopt them. Is that something you\u2019ve talked to her about?", "You really need to Google how the adoption process works. Stay in school, kids.", "INFO: How do you expect to adopt your boyfriend\u2019s kids when their mother seemingly still has parental rights (hence the visitation schedule).", "ESH. Your cousin, wow. But you also- wow with the assuming the children's mom would give up her parental rights so you could adopt them. What a horrible thing to be planning. You have alot of growing up to do.", "INFO: what's the status of bio mom? Because if she doesn't sign her rights to you you can't adopt them. And if you want to attempt it forcefully you'll have a very challenging set of standards to meet. For a step parent to override bio rights to adopt you have to either prove bio parent isn't actually the bio parent (hard to do when the parent in question is the mom) or prove that the children shouldn't be in her custody even for visits. Can you do either of those things? Because if you can't she will HAVE to sign those rights to you willingly and I'm betting you haven't had this convo with her and I'm also betting you'll find opposition when you do. Because you'll have to ask her. You can't adopt these kids without involving her. You need to do some serious research not only about bio/step rights but as well as if you'll even pass adoption standards because those exist too. Even if you marry this man and she signs the rights, if the court doesn't find you fit for whatever reason you can't adopt them. Have you guys really even thought this through?", "ESH. Your cousin had her views but took it too far when you explained that you didn't think like she did. You took it too far when you said that she isn't her mom's real child. You both should be apologizing to each other", "Uh, how could you possibly adopt if their bio mom is still in the picture? Just a your bf has primary custody now doesn't mean the mom can't get custody in the future. Why would she give up her parental rights?", "You can't adopt them if the mother still has her parental rights u can go for guardianship but that can depend on the kids mother agreeing", "I\u2019m going full blown ESH with this one, HEAVILY leaning towards Y T A.\n\nObviously your cousin shouldn\u2019t have been continuously making those remarks, it was rude and uncalled for and not her place to judge.\n\nBut you, oh my god. Their mom is still in their lives, so drag your head out of your ass with this adoption talk. Adopting them would in the end be their choice, when they are old enough to, and unless their mom is a deadbeat or abusive, should not even be a conversation. That is wrong thinking through and through. And yes, what you said was an incredibly low blow.\n\nThe things your cousin said weren\u2019t nice, but you\u2019re on the border of the delusional step mom who thinks the mother means nothing trope.", "ESH. Her for her rude shit about not loving someone  else's kids and you for wanting a mother who is clearly still involved in her kids' lives to sever her parental rights all so you can replace her as the mom to her kids.", "ESH\n\nYour cousin was the A H continuing with her cruel, unnecessary remarks. \n\nYou're an A H trying to say, that you will legally adopt your partner's children, when they have an active, involved mother in their lives. How you plan on adopting them? You'll be the kids' step parent at most, but legally you won't be in any parental role.", "NTA. Your cousin was being rude and judgmental. You used her own logic against her. She shouldn\u2019t have said those things if she didn\u2019t want them said to her. \n\nHowever, her overall point is correct: you will never be your step children\u2019s mother because they already have a mother. You\u2019ll be a mother like figure to them but as long as their mom is alive and present, you\u2019ll just be the step mom, which is still an important role to play. The fact that you think you can adopt these kids is evidence that your cousin is right that you\u2019re a bit naive about the reality of your situation. The only way you can adopt the kids is of their mom dies or terminates her parental rights.", "I feel this is one of those \u201c 2 wrongs don\u2019t make a right \u201c situations. ESH", "ESH - OP for touching what\u2019s obvs a very sore point w the cousin (2 wrongs and all that), the cousin for being an judgmental AH butting into someone else\u2019s business for no good reason, and the family members who\u2019re trying to convince OP that the parent-child relationship is somehow different between adopting a baby vs a partner\u2019s child.", "YTA yes\u2026and how would you adopt your boyfriends kids when they have two parents? Tf is wrong with you", "Okay well first of all, I hope the only conversation you and your partner are having regarding adoption is that you would love to adopt them when they are old enough to understand and give their consent. Lots of young kids have mixed emotions about adoption and it sounds like their bio mom is still in the picture. Not to mention, in majority of places she would have to relinquish her parental rights for you to adopt. \n\nBut other than that, NTA. Your cousin stepped over some very large lines and it sounds like you were trying to see her perspective initially because tbh, dating with kids involved *is* a big commitment at your age, and people do have really complicated relationships to adopting and being adopted.", "YTA.   If you are as mature as you keep telling us, you would have been able to hold your very sharp tongue.  I\u2019m sure this is a very one sided account.", "You have a lot of nerve expecting to adopt children who have a mother that\u2019s actively present in the children\u2019s life .", "NTA.  You simply repeated her \u2018logic\u2019 back to her.  She didn\u2019t like it.  Talk to your mom privately and tell her of her insulting and aggressive behavior.  Your immediate family should know and know that you will apologize once she does.  You don\u2019t see her at all, no need to change that.  Good luck!", "NTA, she was in fact hostile. For zero reason, instead of just being nice.", "ESH she should watch her mouth. But YOU should educate yourself! \n\nRegards adopted child!", "ESH.", "ESH, but your cousin shouldn\u2019t throw stones while living in a glass house.", "NTA. You were only using her own logic against her. She deserved it.", "NTA. For your cousin to say something like that is a bit nervy. As you mentioned, she's adopted. She should be happy that you are with someone you love and wanting to adopt his children. Some people NEVER want others to be happy. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. Your response was considerably more restrained than mine would have been.", "NTA. Wow, your cousin sucks, in my opinion. She didn\u2019t even consider the possibility that you actually care about your fianc\u00e9e and might genuinely care for his kids as well. She went straight to desperation. You suck much less. You probably shouldn\u2019t have said she\u2019s not your aunt\u2019s real child, even if you\u2019re just making a point. Maybe something closer to: \u201cmy affection for my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s children is just as real as your mom\u2019s affection for you\u201d might have been a more gentle way to put it.", "NTA, you literally made it crystal clear that you regard adopted children as no different but pointed out that by her twisted logic she\u2019s not \u2018really\u2019 family. That\u2019s just explaining the ramifications of her argument.", "From your title I was prepared to think you were TA but no, your cousin was the one who insisted adopted children wouldn't be your \"real children.\" \n\nYou're NTA, and your cousin was rude. If she thinks your plans are unwise, there are way better words to express concern than \"wasting your life,\" \"desperate,\" \"glorified babysitter\" and  \"not their real mom.\" \n\nShe could have said something about not setting your expectations too high because children don't always accept a stepmother as mom (just read Reddit for a week for examples of that). But even that would be better coming from a close friend than from someone you haven't been close with since middle school. If anyone should apologize for that conversation it's her.", "Nta, it's absolutely the same.", "NTA. You don't have to apologize for a damned thing. You're an adult. She was being unspeakably rude to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
