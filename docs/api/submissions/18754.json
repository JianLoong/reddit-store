She got irate saying a couple adopting a baby TOGETHER is not the same thing as a desperate person playing stepmom and adopting kids that already have a mom and Ill never be their real mom. I said then I guess youre not MY aunts real child than. She started crying and left sobbing.

Your cousin, wow. But you also- wow with the assuming the children's mom would give up her parental rights so you could adopt them. What a horrible thing to be planning. You have alot of growing up to do.", "INFO: what's the status of bio mom? Because if she doesn't sign her rights to you you can't adopt them. And if you want to attempt it forcefully you'll have a very challenging set of standards to meet. For a step parent to override bio rights to adopt you have to either prove bio parent isn't actually the bio parent (hard to do when the parent in question is the mom) or prove that the children shouldn't be in her custody even for visits. Can you do either of those things? Because if you can't she will HAVE to sign those rights to you willingly and I'm betting you haven't had this convo with her and I'm also betting you'll find opposition when you do. Because you'll have to ask her. You can't adopt these kids without involving her. You need to do some serious research not only about bio/step rights but as well as if you'll even pass adoption standards because those exist too. Even if you marry this man and she signs the rights, if the court doesn't find you fit for whatever reason you can't adopt them. Have you guys really even thought this through?", "ESH. Your cousin had her views but took it too far when you explained that you didn't think like she did. You took it too far when you said that she isn't her mom's real child. You both should be apologizing to each other", "Uh, how could you possibly adopt if their bio mom is still in the picture? Just a your bf has primary custody now doesn't mean the mom can't get custody in the future.

Their mom is still in their lives, so drag your head out of your ass with this adoption talk. Adopting them would in the end be their choice, when they are old enough to, and unless their mom is a deadbeat or abusive, should not even be a conversation. That is wrong thinking through and through. And yes, what you said was an incredibly low blow.\n\nThe things your cousin said weren\u2019t nice, but you\u2019re on the border of the delusional step mom who thinks the mother means nothing trope.", "ESH.

You\u2019ll be a mother like figure to them but as long as their mom is alive and present, you\u2019ll just be the step mom, which is still an important role to play.

Not to mention, in majority of places she would have to relinquish her parental rights for you to adopt. \n\nBut other than that, NTA. Your cousin stepped over some very large lines and it sounds like you were trying to see her perspective initially because tbh, dating with kids involved *is* a big commitment at your age, and people do have really complicated relationships to adopting and being adopted.", "YTA.

You were only using her own logic against her. She deserved it.", "NTA. For your cousin to say something like that is a bit nervy. As you mentioned, she's adopted.

Your response was considerably more restrained than mine would have been.", "NTA. Wow, your cousin sucks, in my opinion. She didn\u2019t even consider the possibility that you actually care about your fianc\u00e9e and might genuinely care for his kids as well. She went straight to desperation. You suck much less. You probably shouldn\u2019t have said she\u2019s not your aunt\u2019s real child, even if you\u2019re just making a point. Maybe something closer to: \u201cmy affection for my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s children is just as real as your mom\u2019s affection for you\u201d might have been a more gentle way to put it.", "NTA, you literally made it crystal clear that you regard adopted children as no different but pointed out that by her twisted logic she\u2019s not \u2018really\u2019 family.

You disrespect the mother of these children by planning to adopt them, they will never be YOUR children.

Adoption isn't gaining an extra legal guardian. It's REPLACING a legal guardian (if the original is alive). So the only way for you to adopt these children is for their mother to die, voluntarily give up her parental rights, or be ordered by a court to give up her rights, due to abuse or similar. This is extremely unlikely, you are unlikely to adopt these children. To compare your foolish and wrong ideas with your niece's actual lived experience is so wrong that your niece is right - her parents' choice is entirely different to your situation. She butted in, but she kind of needed to do so to correct how wrong you are.\n\nSecondly, you were incredibly mean. For someone so 'mature' (a statement which is disproven by your post), you sure jumped to devastating insults reeaaallly quickly. It's a good thing you're unlikely to be the adoptive mother of those kids if you use adoption status as an insult whenever it's convenient to you.\n\nSide note: I really hope you haven't been promising these children things that are beyond your control, like telling them you'll adopt them when you don't know if their mother will agree.", "NTA, she brought it on herself", "YTA your cousin needs to stop running her mouth, but you\u2019re TA. 1) those kids already have a mother.

To me it sounds like they are engaged even if OP/the don't call it that.", "Edit: skip to the 5th down that i start with \"This could all be wrong.\" If you don't want to read it all\n\nI never said anything about the courts not being involved. That is obviously impossible at this point. Courts don't just decide you can't ever see your kids again unless your crime is trying to outright murder them. \n\nLiteral murders and abusers retain parental rights, and we constantly see that played out in news and socials, good or bad ending. If her crime was against the kid, then the \"very mature\" 23 year olds would not even be considering or talking with her. Drugs, violence, and any crime get a punishment and usually result in custody loss for that time but not the loss of all right to see or speak to your child in the future when you have gotten out of prison. \n\nBut here in America, nobody ever really leaves prison. It follows you to every interview and public interaction. Then all the people around you use it as an excuse for why you shouldn't have this or that when you already served your time. Paid for the crime, right? Wrong, when you get out, there is always more to take. Family, dignity, and ability to find a decent job immediately and significantly hindered by people who don't understand or don't care. They don't believe in you or the criminal justice system's ability to reform you, so they ask you to sign your life away in an attempt to never see you again.\n\nWhy is this \"mature\" woman so interested in adopting children with a living mother who was fighting for them and is getting better. She started dating dad when they were 1 and 3. It's almost like she has a perfect vision of \"house\" where she got her man and two kids that call her, and only her, mama but then real mom got out. Almost like she wants to permanently place herself as mom and never have to take the actual mothers thoughts or feelings into account on things in the future. All while spinning the story that she is the caring mom and wife, and even cares deeply for the woman whose kids she is having signed away before moving to family. \n\nThis could all be wrong. She might be telling 100% truth. But if she is so caring and mature, why is she even trying to push this? Wouldn't she want nothing but for her stepkids to have a wonderful relationship with their mother? Would she not want to work with them to understand that they can call her anything they want but she is *insert name* and they have a mom out there who clearly cares and wants for their well-being and she is working hard with family to get better and be more involved. This woman could be completely lost or on the verge of recovery and show back up in a year to talk to her now 4 and 5 year olds and they call someone else mom. \n\nReplacing her like that is wrong and would almost worse if she were dead because she is essentially erasing her. Again, i could be way off, but all of this sets herself up to be perfect. I can't see any motive for adopting other than to take control, be new/real mom, and not have to worry about if she comes back because the paper got signed. I get it she has been involved and cares. \n\nIf she cared so much, she would think about if this was happening to her and stop talking about adopting kids from their parent. A parent who she stated \"gets them every other weekend\" in their post. Not gets to see them or gets a visit. She gets them every other weekend, all weekend. That is shared custody court ordered or not. So either they believe she is safe enough to have them for the weekends or the courts do. If the courts do, then she is definitely being manipulative towards the mother to force her out. If she and the dad are giving them on the weekends without court order, then they clearly see she is getting better and capable even in small steps. Or they aren't as perfect as mature as they claim, are going against courts like you said, and are risking losing custody themselves if something happens.\n\nNone of this makes any sense.

For other people here, their opinion is that the adoption issue is relevant to deciding whether she\u2019s TA or not and I can see their logic. If you\u2019re this triggered by people following their own thought process to answer the question at hand, this sub isn\u2019t the place for you.", "I understand. Her rights were terminated through the court via CPS prior to her conviction.", "Parental or Custodial?  There\u2019s a big difference between the two.", "That doesn't mean she isn't still their legal parent. Courts or no, custody or no, any attempt at adoption by you will have to explicitly involve her consent.\n\nCourts almost never fully sever legal ties between parent and child unless there was abuse, or another party is fully ready to step in and adopt (at the time of that severence).", "\n\n>these kids have a bio mum and she\u2019s involved in their lives, even if she doesn\u2019t have primary custody.  \n\nplenty of kids have been adopted despite having both bio parents play some role in their life.", "That may be a state-by-state thing, because here in the state I'm in, that's not the case. In fact, CYS can file for, and the Court can grant, a termination of parental rights, and start an adoption process for the child, after 6 months if the parent/s are not attempting nor completing their required program.", "Honestly considering the way OP writes I wonder how much she actually knows about the full legality of this case.", "No contact is not a requirement in every state.", "At the time she lost rights she was in a very unstable and dark point, on drugs and in an abusive relationship. After she was released and got clean, my boyfriend allowed supervised visits, then a few hours for the weekend, and now every other weekend. She lives with her grandparents who also spend time with their great grandkids. My boyfriend says shes changed and is more stable, but they both agree she isnt mentally prepared to be a fulltime mom. She likes the situation as it is, it works for everyone", "We have spoken, and she has told me shes okay with it", "Exactly.", "Exactly. The courts had my boyfriend take paternity tests and establish himself as their father because they were removing her rights. Its not like he took her to court to lose her rights. She was already losing them.", "Didn't you say you literally only met them a year ago?", "She didnt lose her rights because she got locked up, she was in the middle of a CPS case already.", "Hes letting her see them because he thinks its the best for them to be around her side of the family too. At the time she lost rights, she was on drugs, in an abusive relationship, and unstable. Once she got free, clean and away from her old issues, they started seeing her every other weekend for a few hours, then every other weekend overnight Saturday pickup Sunday morning on my boyfriend\u2019s discretion. She lives with her grandparents who have a relationship with their grandchildren. Its a second chance.", "I don\u2019t think OP knows the answer. I think her bf isn\u2019t being honest with her about the situation. If the mom lost her parental rights, she would never see those kids again. No parent would allow that.", "Then why the fuck are you allowing her anywhere near the kids, let alone having them by herself?? None of this makes any sense.", "Both.", "She literally isnt their legal parent. Also she already consented to me adopting them. And CPS is the one that severed the ties.", "If the mother's rights were terminated by a Court, it doesn't matter how much she see's them or how involved she is. In the eyes of the law, she's not their legal mother. Biology doesn't reassign rights which have been legally terminated. OP has said the rights were legally terminated. That means OP can adopt the children, with nothing needed from their biological mother.", "People don't usually lose their parental rights for no reason.", "Custody and parental rights vary state to state so her seeing them does not mean the court would not terminate the rights. Also OP said they were already terminated so her seeing them does not reinstate her rights.", "You can move out of state and still maintain rights to your kids.", "Sounds like you're doing great! A huge part of being mature and stable is knowing when you need to ask for advice and knowing whom you can ask. There's a crazy strong emphasis on independence when you're young that wears off when you start to understand who you are as an individual.", "Custody or parental, because there is a huge difference between the two.  DFCS (or whatever your State calls their version of CPS) does not terminate parental rights easily, whereas custodial rights have a far lower threshold.", "So why are the children allowed to see her if she lost her rights?", "Did you had a conversation with the ex about the adoption?", "None of the things you listed would cause a court to take away parental rights. It would cause them to take away custodial rights. Taking away parental rights is a last resort and it usually happens because CPS and a judge agree that the parent is permanently unfit and beyond help. A young woman with a drug addiction and an abusive partner is a typical CPS case. There are way too many examples of women in that situation turning their lives around to become good moms for CPS to look at your step kids\u2019 mom  and decide that she will never be fit to parent these kids. You need to ask your bf to show you the actual court document that says she no longer has parental rights. I think he\u2019s selling you a fairytale.", "If CPS actually terminated her parental rights, she must have done something really dangerous for those kids. So why is he still allowing her to have visitation if she's that unsafe? I can't imagine CPS would ever think that was a good idea.", "I agree, I think OP is all caught up in the true love and happy family mind set that she's not seeing that skme things aren't adding up. I think they're rushing things (especially if the kids are calling her MOM) and she needs to take a step back before eloping.", "Facts", "Eloping has evolved into not necessarily being a secret now though.\n\nI mean maybe the BF is pushing whatever narrative  but we lack a whole load of information to inform her accurately. \n\nHence why I think it all seems irrelevant.", "Her telling you is a bit different than when you go through the process she will have to sign documentation.", "Considering the youngest is 3 and they\u2019ve been together for 2 I wonder if he just found some naive 21 year old to play mom for his kids that he could just appease with promises after his ex went to jail.", "She lost her parental rights. I dont think the decision was made easily, at the time she had a lot of things stacked against her.", "I say this with kindness. You are wrong. If bio mom has lost her parental rights, she wouldn\u2019t get the kids every other weekend. Either your BF is lying to you or he doesn\u2019t understand the situation accurately.\n\nEither way, you shouldn\u2019t be talking about adopting kids that have a bio mom still in their lives.", "[removed]"]}
