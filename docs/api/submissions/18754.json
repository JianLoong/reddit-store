Shes adopted by my aunt and uncle. At a family gathering a few days ago we ran into each other after not seeing each other for almost two years. Since we\u2019re the closest cousins in age there we were talking the whole time. It was awkward. She asks about my boyfriend and I was talking about our upcoming elopement and other things she screws up her face and says she didnt know he has kids. I tell her he has two and she has a look of shock and disgust on her face. She tells me Im too young to be playing stepmom and that Im wasting my life if I marry him. I was shocked at her rudeness and tell her that I love my stepkids and I\u2019d rather be with my boyfriend than anyone else.\n\n \nShe says that she could never sit and pretend to love a child for a man and that she could never love a child that wasnt \u201creally hers\u201d. I bit my tongue at that since shes literally adopted and from what my mom has told me, was only adopted because my aunt is infertile and it was something she had to talk her husband into since he was unsure. I reply and said Im not pretending anything and that of course it took time to build a bond with them and I understand if she wouldnt do it. \n\n\nShe just looks me up and down and says Im too pretty to resort to being a \u201cglorified babysitter\u201d and that shes gonna find it funny in ten years to watch my stepchildren disrespect me at family events and yell that Im not their \u201creal mom\u201d and that theyre not technically lying. I told her that once I legally adopt them they\u2019ll be my children and she had the nerve to scoff. I was shocked at her audacity and asked her if she forgot SHES adopted herself. She got irate saying a couple adopting a baby TOGETHER is not the same thing as a desperate person playing stepmom and adopting kids that already have a mom and Ill never be their real mom. I said then I guess youre not MY aunts real child than. She started crying and left sobbing. When I tried explaining what happened everyone said I was wrong and that I shouldnt have brought her adoption up for question and Im a major asshole and that adopting a baby as a couple is not the same as adopting your partners kids.

Stay in school, kids.", "INFO: How do you expect to adopt your boyfriend\u2019s kids when their mother seemingly still has parental rights (hence the visitation schedule).", "ESH. Your cousin, wow. But you also- wow with the assuming the children's mom would give up her parental rights so you could adopt them. What a horrible thing to be planning. You have alot of growing up to do.", "INFO: what's the status of bio mom? Because if she doesn't sign her rights to you you can't adopt them. And if you want to attempt it forcefully you'll have a very challenging set of standards to meet. For a step parent to override bio rights to adopt you have to either prove bio parent isn't actually the bio parent (hard to do when the parent in question is the mom) or prove that the children shouldn't be in her custody even for visits. Can you do either of those things? Because if you can't she will HAVE to sign those rights to you willingly and I'm betting you haven't had this convo with her and I'm also betting you'll find opposition when you do. Because you'll have to ask her. You can't adopt these kids without involving her. You need to do some serious research not only about bio/step rights but as well as if you'll even pass adoption standards because those exist too. Even if you marry this man and she signs the rights, if the court doesn't find you fit for whatever reason you can't adopt them. Have you guys really even thought this through?", "ESH. Your cousin had her views but took it too far when you explained that you didn't think like she did. You took it too far when you said that she isn't her mom's real child. You both should be apologizing to each other", "Uh, how could you possibly adopt if their bio mom is still in the picture? Just a your bf has primary custody now doesn't mean the mom can't get custody in the future.

Their mom is still in their lives, so drag your head out of your ass with this adoption talk. Adopting them would in the end be their choice, when they are old enough to, and unless their mom is a deadbeat or abusive, should not even be a conversation. That is wrong thinking through and through. And yes, what you said was an incredibly low blow.\n\nThe things your cousin said weren\u2019t nice, but you\u2019re on the border of the delusional step mom who thinks the mother means nothing trope.", "ESH.

She shouldn\u2019t have said those things if she didn\u2019t want them said to her. \n\nHowever, her overall point is correct: you will never be your step children\u2019s mother because they already have a mother. You\u2019ll be a mother like figure to them but as long as their mom is alive and present, you\u2019ll just be the step mom, which is still an important role to play.

Tf is wrong with you", "Okay well first of all, I hope the only conversation you and your partner are having regarding adoption is that you would love to adopt them when they are old enough to understand and give their consent.

Not to mention, in majority of places she would have to relinquish her parental rights for you to adopt. \n\nBut other than that, NTA. Your cousin stepped over some very large lines and it sounds like you were trying to see her perspective initially because tbh, dating with kids involved *is* a big commitment at your age, and people do have really complicated relationships to adopting and being adopted.", "YTA.

Your immediate family should know and know that you will apologize once she does.  You don\u2019t see her at all, no need to change that.  Good luck!", "NTA, she was in fact hostile. For zero reason, instead of just being nice.", "ESH she should watch her mouth. But YOU should educate yourself! \n\nRegards adopted child!", "ESH.", "ESH, but your cousin shouldn\u2019t throw stones while living in a glass house.", "NTA. You were only using her own logic against her. She deserved it.", "NTA. For your cousin to say something like that is a bit nervy. As you mentioned, she's adopted. She should be happy that you are with someone you love and wanting to adopt his children. Some people NEVER want others to be happy. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. Your response was considerably more restrained than mine would have been.", "NTA. Wow, your cousin sucks, in my opinion. She didn\u2019t even consider the possibility that you actually care about your fianc\u00e9e and might genuinely care for his kids as well. She went straight to desperation. You suck much less. You probably shouldn\u2019t have said she\u2019s not your aunt\u2019s real child, even if you\u2019re just making a point. Maybe something closer to: \u201cmy affection for my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s children is just as real as your mom\u2019s affection for you\u201d might have been a more gentle way to put it.", "NTA, you literally made it crystal clear that you regard adopted children as no different but pointed out that by her twisted logic she\u2019s not \u2018really\u2019 family. That\u2019s just explaining the ramifications of her argument.", "From your title I was prepared to think you were TA but no, your cousin was the one who insisted adopted children wouldn't be your \"real children.\" \n\nYou're NTA, and your cousin was rude. If she thinks your plans are unwise, there are way better words to express concern than \"wasting your life,\" \"desperate,\" \"glorified babysitter\" and  \"not their real mom.\" \n\nShe could have said something about not setting your expectations too high because children don't always accept a stepmother as mom (just read Reddit for a week for examples of that).

You disrespect the mother of these children by planning to adopt them, they will never be YOUR children.

Adoption isn't gaining an extra legal guardian. It's REPLACING a legal guardian (if the original is alive). So the only way for you to adopt these children is for their mother to die, voluntarily give up her parental rights, or be ordered by a court to give up her rights, due to abuse or similar. This is extremely unlikely, you are unlikely to adopt these children. To compare your foolish and wrong ideas with your niece's actual lived experience is so wrong that your niece is right - her parents' choice is entirely different to your situation. She butted in, but she kind of needed to do so to correct how wrong you are.\n\nSecondly, you were incredibly mean. For someone so 'mature' (a statement which is disproven by your post), you sure jumped to devastating insults reeaaallly quickly. It's a good thing you're unlikely to be the adoptive mother of those kids if you use adoption status as an insult whenever it's convenient to you.\n\nSide note: I really hope you haven't been promising these children things that are beyond your control, like telling them you'll adopt them when you don't know if their mother will agree.", "NTA, she brought it on herself", "YTA your cousin needs to stop running her mouth, but you\u2019re TA. 1) those kids already have a mother.

She also doesnt want to be a fulltime parent. My boyfriend is their only custodial parent, their arrangement is between them not the court. How am I an asshole for wanting to adopt them?", "Wish I had more characters, but she doesnt have rights.", "Hmm,  this thread seems at odds with this comment from the post:\n\n> We\u2019re both 23 and young but we\u2019re both mature and stable", "She went to prison, and she did lose her parental rights because she was in the middle of a CPS case while they were primarily in her care and they were the ones to recommend termination. When she got locked up for separate reasons she lost her parental rights and the court contacted my boyfriend to establish paternity and custody since he was only on one birth certificate. Hes has full parental and custodial rights for years now, she got locked up when her youngest was a few months.\n\nI havent spoke to an attorney my boyfriend has in terms of their custodial situation. Their mom actually was trying to fight for her rights back but ended up back in jail temporarily and is now moving states to be near family and stability. We\u2019ve met a few times, shes really nice but obviously has been through alot and admits being a mother isnt for her and shes happy I love and want to adopt them in the future.", "Everything sounds perfectly right on your end.", "You can see in previous OP comments that she states that is exactly what happened, rights terminated by the courts through CPS.", "Sounds like dad step up. But yeah, this sounds janky af.", "Tell me you didn't read the comments lol", "Don\u2019t apologize since she was being hypocritical while being an adopted child herself. Deep down she knows she isn\u2019t related to your aunt as her real child. So I don\u2019t know why she even started this and could\u2019ve finished it. I bet she won\u2019t do it again.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry so many people don\u2019t read the comments when they have more questions about the situation and judge about a topic that wasn\u2019t up for judgment. Good luck with your family :) your cousin deserved every word of it.", "Man all the comment about the adoption and how no you can\u2019t because the bio mum is still alive. Have y\u2019all never seen blindside, this is exactly what happens where Michel is adopted by the family whilst the mother is still alive. Just because you have the knowledge and imagination of a tea spoon don\u2019t make you correct. \n\nTo the actual AITA question, I can see why you did what you did. Your cousin is an insufferable spoilt brat with the life experience of a new born foal. Still not a great reaction and you know she is going to get preferential treatment because you know \u201cadopted\u201d. I\u2019m going ESH a little for your reaction op and a huge portion to the cousin.", "NTA the audacity on her is crazy.", "Apologise by not inviting them to your wedding \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA\n\nHer behaviour deserved your response", "You\u2019re not as mature as you think, and it shows in your replies.", "NTA I feel like your cousin never heard the expression \u201cdon\u2019t throw stones if you live in a glass house\u201d lol", "ESH, your cousin said some very rude and hurtful things, but your response was not exactly of a much higher level than hers. You do you, get married, take on the role of stepmom, it's none of her business and her comments have no value.", "Everyone involved appear to be assholes", "Esh", "NTA.   \n\n\nSince the question about AITA was about the comment itself and not the whole adoption stuff, I will ignore the adoption talk for now.   \n\n\nWas the comment needed? No. Do I think it was good that your cousin got a bit of her own medicine? Yes.   \nTalking in the way she was is entirely uncalled for and disgusting, her being given exactly what she said back and then crying about it is hopefully a deep enough hurt that she realises that if you fuck around, you will find out.", "NTA. God your cousin sounds an insufferable AH. She just got back the energy she was putting out. She could have stopped that convo at any point before getting to \"I'll laugh when they disrespect you\". \n\nBtw, they will, but it doesn't mean anything. All kids disrespect their parents.", "People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  She kept berating you for wanting to adopt children while she herself was adopted.  That's tells me she either resents her adoptive parents or she only considers infant adoptions as real.  Either way, she's the asshole, not you.\n\nNTA", "On your actual question, NTA because you were playing Devil\u2019s Advocate with your cousin, but the whole \u201creal mother\u201d thing is a really sensitive topic with adoptees, and you were never going to win the debate by making that statement. She was being an ass, and you were better off just ending the discussion.", "NTA. She was acting really odd for an adopted person. (I'm adopted, and while I'd tell people not to adopt an older kid out of the system, because we're the really messed up kids, I would encourage anyone to do what's right for them and the children.) You sound amazing! I wish you, and those babies, luck in life.", "NTA, your cousin was being a B about it and kept pushing about technicalities, even when you were clearly uncomfortable. She wanted to get into the nitty gritty of it to be hurtful and got hurt in the process. It doesn't matter if you can or cannot adopt, you love those kids and would adopt them, which imo means a lot more than two people getting a random ass baby just because they want one.", "NTA. At least from what you are telling us about the discussion with her. It could of course be heavily biased, what she said and what you replied. \n\nIt seems that she is much younger than you are (at least mentally) and from what she said it sounds like a teenager trying to be edgy. Anyway, what she apparently said to you is incredibly rude towards your decision, your care for the children and your husband and towards other people who adopt children. The others who say that there is a difference between adopting as a couple and as a partner should get their heads out of their asses. \n\nHowever I agree that it might be beneficial to apologize to her for your own rude remark at the end. Still, stay firm on your own point, if you adopt they will be your children and you know yourself that you love them already anyway.", "I think you need to understand that you can't just adopt a mother's children. Even if she moves to another state she has rights and it might be that with support she turns her life around and wants to parent her children. Children nearly always prefer their Mum to be Mum.  Having said that I know that being a Stepmum can be a thankless task.  As for your question, you could've shown maturity by disengaging from the conversation without lashing out and hurting someone so badly. That's what  maturity is, grace.", "You're n t a for how you spoke to your cousin but majorly YTA for considering adopting kids whose mother is still present and in the picture!!!! You claim in comments she lost her parental rights bc she went to prison. That doesn't give you a right to claim her children as your own.\n\nI grew up with step parents and my real parents. I loved my step parents very very much, as much as my bio parents. However if my stepdad had tried to adopt me out from under my bio dad our relationship would never have recovered.\n\n Are you not capable of loving and caring for children you don't have a legal claim to?", "Fuck around and find out. NTA.", "ESH\n\nPart of being a mature adult is knowing when to walk away. Her behavior was insulting and atrocious but you stooped to her level.", "NTA.", "NTA. You tried to keep it mature. Your cousin decided to escalate things. Don\u2019t start no shit, won\u2019t be no shit", "This isn't relevant to what she's asking.\n\n There's plenty of ways a step parent can become legally responsible for the step kids that are not adoption.", "Imagine judging her for wanting to adopt them without knowing anything about the background of the situation. Did you even consider that she had reasons to believe she would be able to adopt them before calling her horrible for wanting to give children a stable mother figure?", "Am I the only one who read that the mother is already on board with this??? That alone should tell you about the mother even without the fact she went to jail repeatedly and CPS was involved even before that.", "The mother lost her parental rights so they want OP to be able to adopt.", "Maybe you should read more comments or ask op about why she was adopting before judging why she is adopting", "had to go way too far down to find a post saying about the kids feelings/consent rather than \"um actually OP, here's the law as I understand it with a limitted knowledge of your situation so Y T A\".", "Read OPS comments.  Bio mom had parental rights terminated", "You have a lot of nerve to be judging a situation you know nothing about, especially when that\u2019s not the situation she asked to be judged. Reading comments for further explanation is haaaaaaard.", "The OP said in the comments that the mother is fine with her adopting the children. If true, the mother is not being disrespected because it's a decision that she supports.", "And you are an A for not ready any of her comments and just putting the bare minimum in to the issue. Read some of OP comments and get learned up.", "Educate yourself on some of ops comments, also watch blindside if you think it dosnt happen.", "There are many reasons why and there are lots of cases where the other parent \u201cexists\u201d.  The OP has said that he is allowing visitation but it\u2019s between them, not the courts and since CPS was already involved with the mother when she went to jail repeatedly the court terminated her rights.  So yes, she can be stepmom that becomes mom in this scenario.", "She says in one comment that the mother is moving away and is okay with OP adopting her children...so I guess that's between them", "Yeah. Almost every 23 y.o. thinks they are mature and stable. We will see what OP thinks about herself at that age in 10 years. \n\nI honestly thought i knew it all in my early 20s. Oh, boy, was i an idiot \ud83d\ude05", "And \"eloping \"", "So here\u2019s my question\u2026 if she  \u201clost her rights\u201d as you mention in your comments. And per you she lost her rights per the courts. Then she must have done something pretty bad. So why is she still having them on the weekends? I know personally (from my childhood) that it isn\u2019t that easy for a parent to lose their rights. Also if they did do something bad enough to lose their rights then they would only be able to do supervised visits. \n\nSo many questions", "Read ops comments on this subject and check your comment.", "And as everyone knows, two wrongs make a right.", "I didn\u2019t know that you could terminate parental rights without someone else immediately taking that role.", "I feel like I knew a lot more in my 20s. It seems like the older I get, the less I know. \n\nI'm sure it is because I now understand the breadth of what I don't know.  But damn,  I miss knowing everything.", "It\u2019s not so much \u201ctwo wrongs\u201d as it is using facts to point out the person\u2019s hypocrisy", "I know you say bio mom lost parental rights, but when asked to explain, you describe her losing *custody*. Losing parental rights is completely different and much less common", "You don\u2019t know there are thousands upon thousands of children in the foster care system in the US who have no parents with parental rights because nobody stepped in the role?  Or in this case specifically that the OP stated CPS was already involved before the mother went to jail and then went back again?  Nobody has said it was immediately but it seems it was an ongoing investigation that CPS rounded up the children\u2019s father in so he could take custody after they removed the mother\u2019s rights.", "That's exactly what I was thinking! \nEspecially since they are still letting mum have the kids even after CPS was involved and took the kids away from her.", "That\u2019s as may be but adoption means changing the birth certificates to reflect that- these kids have a bio mum and she\u2019s involved in their lives, even if she doesn\u2019t have primary custody. Unless she full on terminates her parental rights you can\u2019t adopt them. Also the children will be asked for their opinion on being adopted and they may not want to totally lose their mother, even if they love you deeply and accept you as a mother figure day to day. \n\n\nYou should speak with an attorney or lawyer specialising in this type of case. Bio mum sounds like she\u2019s fighting demons and chops and changes her mind on things, best if you know what your options are.", "OP misunderstands the situation and then explains her misunderstanding as fact. Custody and parental rights don't work the way she explained, even though she believes it does.", "Love everyone in the comments assuming they know more about the situation than the person involved in it.", "Where did you pass the bar exam? Do you practice in all 50 states? Because what she described is perfectly reasonable and a liable legal option. She has said multiple times she doesn't have parental rights. Just because you think OP is uneducated does not mean she is.", "Love people who blindly trust one-sided stories from \"very mature\" 23 year olds one of whom has two children with the \"immature\" one. The other is just trying to remove any right the actual mother has to even talk to her children let alone be a caregiver", "Exactly this and we also don't know if her reason for going to jail is related to the children. I have seen right being terminated for far less sadly and for all we know, she likely put the children in danger since the CPS was involved and pushed for a termination. - If the story is now correctly told.", "Where did you pass the bar exam? Do you practice in all 50 states? \n\nWhat's that? The know it all questions you asked can't be turned back on you because it isn't fair? Typical", "Love people who decide someone is actively lying based purely on the fact they're 23.", "But the OP said that the mother gets them every other weekend (which doesn't make sense if she lost her parental rights). It is extremely unlikely that CPS would allow that if her reason for going to jail was related to the children/she put them in danger.", "Exactly. There are plenty of cases where mothers *do* lose rights AND custody because of what sent them to jail. I respect OP for not being specific as well, as it's likely not our business in the first place. She seems to respect the mother and choices she's made since knowing the kids. Which, letting the person they call mom adopt them is an amazing choice, even if it's a hard one.", "She is also very clearly trying to better herself and the father of her children is telling her to just give up the kids forever, and she is considering it after previously fighting. She could easily be getting manipulated by the \"very mature\" 23 year olds one of whom has multiple kids with her. She could easily be on track to being better, and in her weakened state, where she is relying on guidance of others to get her bearings they convinced her to give everything up and get tf out of their lives forever. \n\nAdoption is completely unnecessary regardless of how screwed up she really is. Just be a stepmom without adoption, big deal.", "Omg hahahaha you got me so good! You're soooo smart!!

Bs weeb ramblings from some reddit smart guy that got hyper offended at being called out with the same bs they tried.\n\nExactly as expected. Thank you", "If she can better her self and get out of prison(which, being transferred states in prison is never really a good sign if you didn't request it, it implies heightened security level or rehab not working where you are), then she will.
