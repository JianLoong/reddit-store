I (30M) was taking out the laundry from the machine and hanging it up on a clothes dryer. As I was hanging up one of my gf\u2019s (29F) underwear I noticed a dark period blood stain on them (roughly an inch or 2 long). I put the underwear to the side and finished hanging everything else up. My gf then returned home to our apartment and I let her know (thinking she\u2019d have some trusted technique to remove the stain). She looked at it and then hung it up with the rest of the laundry. I said \u2018don\u2019t you want to try remove the stain?\u2019 Then I suggested a blood removal method I literally just read online a minute earlier. She responded \u2018no it\u2019s ok, it\u2019ll just get bloody again anyway.\u2019 Then we carried on our evening (underwear hanging up in the corner and all).\n\nIn my head I\u2019m like -errr ok, if I got a blood stain on my clothes I\u2019d try remove it asap, especially underwear. And if not, I wouldn\u2019t plan on wearing them again\u2026\n\nWIBTA for bringing this up again today? Maybe say it\u2019s odd that she doesn\u2019t want to try remove the stain and that she seems perfectly happy to wear them again. Perhaps I could suggest a method to help? I know this is a personal choice and blood stains there are perfectly natural, but is it that crazy that I find her thinking a bit unpleasant? Unhygienic?\n\nEdit: these aren\u2019t her \u2018period panties\u2019 as they are small and light green in colour. As I understand it, period panties would be dark (?) and large in size? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Also I believe this is a new stain as I\u2019ve not seen them with a stain this obvious before (I usually do the laundry chores in our home).\n\nEdit2: wow so much hate towards me for asking a simple WIBTA question. I\u2019m trying to educate myself here too btw.

Most of us do everything we can to avoid stains in the first place, but once it happens, it's not unusual to think, \"oh well,\" and move on. Some continue wearing them --usually, they're left to wear specifically during period or at any \"non-special\" times when you don't think anyone else will see them, or if they do, it won't be a problem. And some throw them away. That is a personal choice.\n\nYour letting her know about the stain was fine. You being hung up on the fact she doesn't want to remove it is weird. And if you bring it up again, you'll get into asshole territory. You don't get to micromanage your girlfriend's underwear policies.\n\nETA: And by the way, once the garment has been washed, it's almost impossible to remove the remaining stains. Blood stains and all other kinds of stains must be pre-treated/removed manually before putting the item in the washer.

We usually keep them as our \"period panties.\" And no, they don't have to be dark or large.

Period stains aren't unhygienic and can literally only be aesthetically unpleasant if they've been washed. If it's her panties she gets to decide if that's a problem for her. \n\nBut I have to admit I almost want to say go ahead and tell her all this just so she's better informed on your opinions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, period panties are literally anything that people who have periods don't mind getting stained, and if she didn't mind this specific one or any underwear being stained then you guessed it, all panties are period panties now", "YWBTA.\n\nHonestly, if any of my undies get blood stains, I just designate them as underwear to wear again during the next period. It's really not worth trying to save them, and there's nothing unhygienic about it. I assume she isn't going to wear these when anyone will see them on her. Trust your girlfriend, as she has likely been menstruating longer than you.", "YTA. Not sure why you\u2019re mansplaining a period to a woman?\n\n\u201cI googled how to remove a stain\u201d - dude, she\u2019s 29. We learn this when we get our period around 10-13.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unhygienic\u201d they\u2019re clean, no? Why toss perfectly good panties? I\u2019ll spill a dark little lady secret: our period doesn\u2019t come on the same day every month. Sometimes, it\u2019s not even *close*. If I spill (pad got all fucked up and it leaked on the sides), or I get it unexpectedly, those are the panties I wear for about a week leading up to my normal date. Obviously not the same pair, but they are stained in some way, small or not. It happens no matter what you do. They also don\u2019t come completely out, and it\u2019s also not worth the time to sit there and scrub it out when it\u2019s just going to happen again. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re filthy, but things leak. More often than not, most of my stains are from my pad getting scrunched in my sleep or something. I wear the jumbo ones with wings but I\u2019m a pretty rough sleeper. \n\n\u201cMaybe I should it up again\u201d why? She gave you her answer. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wear them again\u201d. This is the mindset of a man. You don\u2019t have to deal with blood stained underwear. We literally can\u2019t afford to replace underwear every time it\u2019s stained. It\u2019s such a massive, massive waste. Understand that, sometimes, I\u2019ll stain 2-3 pairs a *cycle*. Not because I\u2019m dirty, or nasty, or unhygienic - but, simply, my period is incredibly irregular and, again, it leaks. It isn\u2019t often that it\u2019s multiple because I wear my stained undies so it isn\u2019t a problem anyway, but still. It comes a week early, a week late, 2 weeks early, like shit is wack. I\u2019ve gone months without a period. My longest was 2 *years* (blissful, blissful years). Probably not healthy but eh, I don\u2019t really care.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised people got mean in the comments. You\u2019re mansplaining a woman\u2019s period to her and how she should take care of her body. She\u2019s 29. She\u2019s likely had her period since 10-ish like the rest of us. There are some things that men shouldn\u2019t have an opinion on and this is one of them. You don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re not us. Your entire tone and attitude is disgusting and just ew, but that\u2019s not my point. \n\nUnderstand that this is normal and you have to get over it. Period.", "YWBTA if you brought it up again. She's been dealing with this far, far, far longer than you have known about these methods. Trust me, whatever you think you're going to inform her of, she likely already knows. She has been dealing with this for at least half her life, if not longer. \n\nAs others have said, period panties are sometimes just regular underwear that has gotten stained that women tend to use during their periods so they're not accidentally staining other underwear. They're washed, so they are hygienic, just discoloured. \n\nI would just move past it. She knows what she's doing far more than you. You may not be the asshole now for asking once, but I wouldn't ask again. Just move on, the stained underwear is perfectly fine and is not hurting anyone.", "YTA. Any pair of panties becomes 'period panties' when you get your period in them and it winds up on them. Once the stain is set, it's set. We know this by now, so no, we're not really that interested in someone 'helpfully' trying to offer stain removal techniques. Menstrual blood isn't just blood, so it can be more difficult to get out, especially if you've had to wear them all day with the stain setting. Them panties are ruined. And they can be any pair, not just large dark ones. They can be big ol granny panties, which are ones people usually think of and it's likely because of pad use. They can also be a cute thong you were wearing and surprise period ruined them. \n\nIt's weird to you, but your gf has had over a decade of this happening likely every month. We learn to write off panties and just save our frustrations for things that are more important and that we're more capable of controlling.", "YTA\n\n>Then I suggested a blood removal method I literally just read online a minute earlier. \n\nMaybe she's thought about this issue for longer than a minute, idk, it's possible.", "YTA panties are going to have blood stains.

This is a complete non-issue for her, so it should be a non-issue for you too. It is very common for women to have blood stained underwear. \n\nPeriod blood is not gross, it\u2019s so normal it\u2019s boring.

I generally prefer, as would you clearly, to remove any and all stains. However in that location it's a personal preference whether or not the effort is worth it to the person wearing it, sometimes it's also just not gonna happen. It was nice that you set it aside and let her provide input when you didn't know, no wrong doing there. There is no sanitary implication to a stain. I have some underwear that is cheap and I'd just throw it away rather than put in the effort of removal. Typically I get one stained pair when it starts and I immediately stain remove, if it's gone through the wash it's unlikely that it's going to come out anyway and even though I'd prefer not to have a stain I know it's not coming out so I'll live with it.

Doesn't happen too often thank god... \nBut if a woman felt the need to talk to me about how to clean my underwear after I told her to drop it,  I wouldn't appreciate it. At all.

I (30M) was taking out the laundry from the machine and hanging it up on a clothes dryer. As I was hanging up one of my gf\u2019s (29F) underwear I noticed a dark period blood stain on them (roughly an inch or 2 long). I put the underwear to the side and finished hanging everything else up. My gf then returned home to our apartment and I let her know (thinking she\u2019d have some trusted technique to remove the stain). She looked at it and then hung it up with the rest of the laundry. I said \u2018don\u2019t you want to try remove the stain?\u2019 Then I suggested a blood removal method I literally just read online a minute earlier. She responded \u2018no it\u2019s ok, it\u2019ll just get bloody again anyway.\u2019 Then we carried on our evening (underwear hanging up in the corner and all).\n\nIn my head I\u2019m like -errr ok, if I got a blood stain on my clothes I\u2019d try remove it asap, especially underwear. And if not, I wouldn\u2019t plan on wearing them again\u2026\n\nWIBTA for bringing this up again today? Maybe say it\u2019s odd that she doesn\u2019t want to try remove the stain and that she seems perfectly happy to wear them again. Perhaps I could suggest a method to help? I know this is a personal choice and blood stains there are perfectly natural, but is it that crazy that I find her thinking a bit unpleasant? Unhygienic?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The undies are clean and honestly it's a pain trying to remove stains especially when no one is gonna see it (ur at that point in the relationship where she doesn't have to pretend she always looks put together and can be comfy looking like a mess together so yea you count as \"no one\"). If they were nice looking or expensive panties that's different, and I'm sure there are people who do remove the stains on their everyday undies but it's not necessary and not a sign of poor hygiene not too. Let it be or offer to deal with the stains yourself (fun fact: saliva is an excellent blood stain remover! It just has to come from the same person as the blood).\n\nAnd for the person who feels the need to bring this up: blood stains are different than shit stains! Shit stains happen because you didn't clean your ass thoroughly enough and left poop on your butt. Period stains happen because your period started and you didn't have any blood catching products in place bc you weren't on your period until that moment, or because your blood catcher wasn't in right/overfilled, or bc you slept in a position that caused your blood to fall somewhere your pad wasn't.

Like *whatever* undies are comfy and work with whatever type of period protection is being used. Could be anything from a thong to boxers, anything. What distinguishes our period undies from our regular undies, is that they've already been stained so we might as well just wear them again! Sometimes a nice pair accidentally becomes our period undies, oftentimes we wear designated (pre-stained) period undies for a week or more on either end of the expected cycle to avoid stains on new or nice undies.\n\nI understand you're trying to learn but you didn't seem to want to learn what your girlfriend was willing to tell you.
