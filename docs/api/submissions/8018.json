{"id": 8018, "submission_id": "10ist5m", "title": "AITA for pointing out that my brother's girlfriend is being a hypocrite in refusing to come to my wedding ceremony?", "selftext": "My brother and Mandy have been dating for two and a half years. Mandy grew up heavily involved in the fundamental part of her religion. Over Covid she became less religious and started dating my brother. My brother and my fiance were roommates and she started hanging around a lot right after he'd proposed. We ended up becoming close and friends in our own right and she literally helped me pick my venue. \n\nWhich is why I was so blindsided when she called me yesterday and said she couldn't come to the ceremony. She said that she'd talked to her dad about it and he'd been very \"distressed\" at the thought of her going to a Church. She said in her religion it's considered idol worship and her dad had begged her not to go. She said she felt like she hurt her dad a lot in other ways by breaking her religion and wanted to respect him in that. \n\nI was kind of calm on the phone but got pissed after we hung up. I've watched this girl break almost every rule her religion has, she drinks like a fish, smokes, eats food she shouldn't, is dating my brother which she said is a huge no, etc. Basically if her religion is real she's already going to hell lol. But this is the one she's sticking with? I was just saying to my fiance a few weeks ago I wish my brother had met Mandy sooner bc I would have made her a bridesmaid. \n\nSo I got upset and texted Mandy how I was feeling, that I didn't appreciate her calling me and our family idolaters and that she was being hypocritical and since when do grown ass woman have to do what their dads who believe in a patriarchal, oppressive religion say when she's already done plenty. And then I just got a text from my brother saying \"WTF? You need to call Mandy tomorrow and apologize.\" My fiance agrees that Mandy should apologize to us, especially because his family *are* devout church goers and won't appreciate being compared to pagan sinners. \n\nSo I was wondering, AITA? Or is Mandy?\n\n\nEDIT: I talked to my brother. I told him I didn't want Mandy to come to the wedding at all. He said he wished I would reconsider. He also told us something he'd never told us, that he met Mandy at some kind of Temple for Jews who aren't fundamental because he wants to convert. And that it was the Rabbi (it's a girl I don't know if they're called the same) who told Mandy to listen to her father on this one because he is in ill health. We are all very blindsided with this information and I've been at my mother's house because she's very upset so I probably won't be able to respond to many more comments. Thanks for the input everyone.\n\nEDIT 2: Apparently this Rabbi also told my brother that she has a problem with *specifically* the way that my Church conducts weddings that is an issue and she was the one who suggested Mandy just go to the reception. And this person is now also giving spiritual advise and lessons on the Old Testament to my brother. And he won't even come over and talk to our family.", "created_utc": 1674418015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ist5m/aita_for_pointing_out_that_my_brothers_girlfriend/", "score": 1385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some less traditional will accept a mosque, but churches, Hindu and Buddhist temples, etc, are not OK. *Especially* if there is a Mass being performed, as in a wedding sacrament. It doesn't mean that people of that religion are bad (and again, that's a very Christian viewpoint), it's that under Judaism you are not supposed to engage in other religious practices other than Judaism. \n\nShe is not being hypocritical, you are pushing your understanding of religion onto her *completely different religion.*\n\nEDIT: NEVERMIND OP IS BEING GROSSLY ANTI-SEMITIC AND SAYING THAT JEWS (THE OG ABRAHAMIC RELIGION, MIND YOU) ARE \"PICKING AND CHOOSING\" THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME AS CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM.\n\nEDIT 2: LMAO THE BROTHER IS PLANNING TO CONVERT TO JUDAISM THAT'S HOW THEY MET.

Mandy is probably still dealing with trauma from the spiritual abuse inherent in growing up in a fundamentalist tradition (I've had friends go through similar), so a calm and understanding response to help her work through it might have been more appropriate.

It sounds like for a while, Mandy was experimenting, trying out new things\u2014and now that her father is nearing the end of his life, she\u2019s returning to a form of practice that is both personal and familial. I completely understand feeling blindsided; it is your wedding, and it sounds like you didn\u2019t expect this. But please also consider: what would you do, if your very ill father called you and begged you not to do one specific thing? Would you be able to refuse him?\n\nI also do want to note, since you have a brother converting: it seems like there\u2019s a lot you may not know about Judaism, or the history of persecution of the Jewish people by Christians. To the best of my knowledge, there are no prohibitions against smoking or drinking; Mandy\u2019s not doing anything that goes against halacha there, afaik. You also seem to take a lot of umbrage at the idea of being compared to \u201cpagan sinners,\u201d and I would urge you to consider why that seems to hit such a sore spot, when one of the points that most distinguishes Judaism from Christianity is that Judaism does not hold that Jesus is the Messiah\u2014if Mandy is Jewish, it follows that she would not consider a church to be a house of worship. And referring to Judaism as a \u201cpatriarchal and oppressive religion\u201d when you are a devout Christian seems more than a little unfair. Neither religion has a spotless record, and both have their own forms of reckoning to do in this area. \n\nMost of all, though, you seem to be angry at your brother\u2014not for abstaining from your wedding, but for \u201clying\u201d to you. The sense I get from you is that Mandy\u2019s Jewishness was acceptable as long as she wasn\u2019t \u201ctoo much\u201d\u2014as long as she kept it at a cultural level and abstained from the more spiritual and religious aspects of Judaism, and as long as your brother was still a Christian and uninvolved in her traditions. That\u2019s a deeply unfair expectation to place on both your brother and his girlfriend, and viewing them through this lens is both unkind and antisemitic. \n\nI would say that it might help to sit down for an actual talk with your brother (and maybe Mandy, although that might wait) where you try and come from a place of genuine understanding. What draws him to Judaism? How did he come to this path? Maybe he can also start to explain his and Mandy\u2019s beliefs (probably much more clearly than I can) and you can both start to build from a new ground of mutual understanding.", "ehh- jewish outright forbids entering a trinitarian church except in the most dire of circumstances.", "This is it.", "Actually it does read my updates.
