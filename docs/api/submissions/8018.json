My brother and my fiance were roommates and she started hanging around a lot right after he'd proposed. We ended up becoming close and friends in our own right and she literally helped me pick my venue. \n\nWhich is why I was so blindsided when she called me yesterday and said she couldn't come to the ceremony. She said that she'd talked to her dad about it and he'd been very \"distressed\" at the thought of her going to a Church. She said in her religion it's considered idol worship and her dad had begged her not to go. She said she felt like she hurt her dad a lot in other ways by breaking her religion and wanted to respect him in that. \n\nI was kind of calm on the phone but got pissed after we hung up. I've watched this girl break almost every rule her religion has, she drinks like a fish, smokes, eats food she shouldn't, is dating my brother which she said is a huge no, etc. Basically if her religion is real she's already going to hell lol. But this is the one she's sticking with? I was just saying to my fiance a few weeks ago I wish my brother had met Mandy sooner bc I would have made her a bridesmaid. \n\nSo I got upset and texted Mandy how I was feeling, that I didn't appreciate her calling me and our family idolaters and that she was being hypocritical and since when do grown ass woman have to do what their dads who believe in a patriarchal, oppressive religion say when she's already done plenty. And then I just got a text from my brother saying \"WTF? You need to call Mandy tomorrow and apologize.\" My fiance agrees that Mandy should apologize to us, especially because his family *are* devout church goers and won't appreciate being compared to pagan sinners. \n\nSo I was wondering, AITA?

What is important to Mandy is keeping her relationship with her father.", "No I mean she's literally white, she is not a Persian Jew or an Ethiopian Jew. Like she was born in America.", "I love this and I want to watch it", "The first Rabbi was Orthodox, the second was Reform. They are different denominations much like Catholics and Protestants. Reform is, broadly speaking, more about choosing individually. However, Mandy is not Reform, she is Orthodox.", "I do not have good feelings about her parenting children when she\u2019s got a skewed sense of what he affiliations are. Especially if her own parents have a say on what she does w her life", "It's true that there are as many threads of Orthodox Judaism as there are threads of Evangelical Christianity, and that each has it's own unique take on various points of dogma and faith. In my wife's case (she comes from a long line of Orthodox Rabbis) drinking was fine, smoking was fine and attending  weddings, funerals, etc etc in Churches was fine as long as they did not recite prayers or otherwise engage directly in the service. A variant on that is how my FIL and his side of my wife's family were able to justify attending our secular wedding. It helped that we had a judge who is not only an Orthodox Jew but a good friend of her family do the service.", "You are not just wrong, but offensively wrong.", "It was fermented grape juice. Because they couldn\u2019t drink the water. Not \u201cfancy grape juice\u201d", "You want her to accept you but you\u2019re not willing to accept her at all.", "White Jews are still Jewish, because as I said, Judaism is an ethnic group. Her race is white, her ethnicity is Jewish. White Jews still face oppression on the basis of being Jewish.", "Fifth, it is not a Jewish \"Church.\" It's called Temple or a synagogue. Not sure what is happening with OP here but something is definitely off.", "She\u2019s still entitled to say she thinks it violates her faith. I think she could have worded it better but they should both try acting like adults instead of blowing up the family. So she can\u2019t go to the ceremony in the church. Invite her to the reception that isn\u2019t based on religion and call it good.", "Oh I understand now what you were saying. I was arguing the point more that if she was so respectful she probably wouldn't make those jokes, which I can't even type here. I'm sure the other ethnic religious and racial minorities would also be offended if a member of their community made similar ones, because this wasn't like lightly poking fun.", "It\u2019s called a temple", "Do you know what a \"denomination\" is? Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are umbrella terms. There are billions of people encompassed in those terms and they don't all believe the same thing.", "I'm Jewish and my religion does not forbid drinking, it's required on holidays. I don't know where you're getting your info but as someone who was raised Jewish, you're wrong.", "You\u2019re just antisemitic", "Sounds like you've got an issue with Jewish people and Judaism based on your incorrect understanding of them and it. Maybe you should address your negative assumptions, because you're sounding pretty bigoted.", "I was on your side until the comments when you started being weird about her religion. These comments make me think you\u2019ve been antisemitic to her before. You don\u2019t get to decide what the rules in Judaism should be just because it is spoiling your special day.", "Actually, making jokes about Jews is one of the longest-standing Jewish cultural traditions. Most small subgroups enjoy this type of humor. Even really, really dark humor.", "also christianity doesn't have a belief structure like this because it's a proselytizing religion. \n\nand arguably christianity over history readily co-opted non-christian beliefs, dates, and celebrations in (successful) attempts to grow."]}
