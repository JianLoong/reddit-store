My brother and my fiance were roommates and she started hanging around a lot right after he'd proposed. We ended up becoming close and friends in our own right and she literally helped me pick my venue. \n\nWhich is why I was so blindsided when she called me yesterday and said she couldn't come to the ceremony. She said that she'd talked to her dad about it and he'd been very \"distressed\" at the thought of her going to a Church. She said in her religion it's considered idol worship and her dad had begged her not to go. She said she felt like she hurt her dad a lot in other ways by breaking her religion and wanted to respect him in that. \n\nI was kind of calm on the phone but got pissed after we hung up. I've watched this girl break almost every rule her religion has, she drinks like a fish, smokes, eats food she shouldn't, is dating my brother which she said is a huge no, etc. Basically if her religion is real she's already going to hell lol. But this is the one she's sticking with? I was just saying to my fiance a few weeks ago I wish my brother had met Mandy sooner bc I would have made her a bridesmaid. \n\nSo I got upset and texted Mandy how I was feeling, that I didn't appreciate her calling me and our family idolaters and that she was being hypocritical and since when do grown ass woman have to do what their dads who believe in a patriarchal, oppressive religion say when she's already done plenty. And then I just got a text from my brother saying \"WTF? You need to call Mandy tomorrow and apologize.\" My fiance agrees that Mandy should apologize to us, especially because his family *are* devout church goers and won't appreciate being compared to pagan sinners. \n\nSo I was wondering, AITA?

That said, two Jews, three opinions, and there are various reasons many might go to one.\n\nI wouldn't go to non-tourist-site-cathedrals on my own, but I would go to attend a close relative or a close friend's life cycle event.", "No, she didn't. She said that in their religion it is *considered* to be idolatry, and that's why her father begged her not to go. That doesn't mean she thinks it really is; it means her father does.", "No she said her father feels that way. And she isn't ready to cause that kind of rift", "Yes, excactly!", "Pretty sure she didn't tell her father about all the rules she has broken in details. However, as she has told him about the wedding in a church and he has specifically asked her not to go, she doesn't feel to do it anymore.", "There can easily be lines that you just don't cross in a religion. Other things might hurt him, because they're considered sins; this is considered *idolatry*, which is a totally different league.\n\nI know in my religion, that would be a line in the sand that could wreck a relationship, if an Orthodox parent asked their child not to do it and they did it anyway. I don't know about Mandy's father's religion, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were something similar: that she was willing to do things that he didn't like, but not something which might cause irreparable damage to their relationship.", "She's not getting financial support from him, actually the opposite, she's told me she makes more then her parents ever did. Her Dad also said she can't date my brother and she didn't listen to him. And her dad says she can't eat at restaurants but she does. And she *literally* went to the Vatican, the most Christian place on earth.", "Drinking and smoking are according to her considered okay according to orthodox jews which is hilarious because fundamentalists believe that the wine in the Bible is grape juice. But maybe eating a cheeseburger... lol\n\nThank you for not jumping down my throat i appreciate it.", "Yay, I have no idea why he got into any of it. Maybe if he knows the family well, he would hear about the wedding anyway, and know there's no chance his daughter wouldn't be invited, but that's the only thing I can think of.", "More or less. Not everyone uses that holy book, of course. But there's something similarly obscure and largely abandoned in every other.", "Sorry I should have been clear she isn't a different race just her religion.", "FYI, Orthodox Judaism has no restrictions on drinking or smoking.  In fact on certain holidays it\u2019s required to drink alcohol. Eating a cheeseburger I\u2019ll give you.", "Ummm. My wife was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family. She identifies as Jewish. But she's been married to me, raised Protestant, for the last 40 years. Yeah her family wasn't thrilled. (We had a secular ceremony which was just as bad in their eyes.) But they came around in the end. BTW Orthodox Jews are allowed to drink and smoke...but that doesn't invalidate your basic point--and you are right about their being allowed to attend church services.", "You do know that Orthodox Jews can drink and smoke right?", "Can someone chime in here on the whole not allowed to attend a wedding in a church thing for Orthodox Jews? I have not heard of that before.\n\nDecided not to be lazy and went looking. \n\nhttps://www.thejc.com/judaism/rabbi-i-have-a-problem/is-it-forbidden-for-jews-to-enter-a-church-1.4626?reloadTime=1674000000011", "Oh I see. \n\nYour brother does realize that based on the precepts of her religion she isn't even supposed to be with him.....Her family will not accept him unless he converts.

The post says it\u2019s a \u201chuge-no\u201d, but based on the WTF text from the brother, she\u2019s still with him. \n\nETA: wrote that before your second half of the comment updated. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she definitely is a hypocrite, just that without more explanation she does come across as contradictory and hurtful in her reasoning. Especially with OP\u2019s clarifying comments.", "Some Fundamentalist Christians may believe that. Jews most definitely do not. As many others have already pointed out, you have a limited understanding of the religion and are viewing it through an entirely inaccurate Christian lens.", "\ud83d\ude01 You did nothing wrong. I have read where Orthodox Jewish people will attend weddings of friends in churches but I guess that depends on where they personally draw the line. I would ask your brother if he intends to convert since her religion is soooo important to her.", "I\u2019m picturing she was just conversing with him and it came out, but you could be correct as well.", "Judaism is an ethnoreligion. It's both a religion and an ethnic group with a distinct cultural heritage.", "Why would God require you to drink alcohol, which is scientifically proven to be bad for you, and the Bible explicitly warns against even in the Old Testament which Jews use? That just doesn't make any sense, it's still hypocritical and cherry picking religion based off of what you want.", "Did you know that many people believe the wine in the Bible wasn't like the alcohol we have today? That certain words when translated don't actually mean fermented by were probably closer to fancy grape juice? All fundamentalists agree on this. They are still being hypocritical.", "I wish I could give you an award but I have no money. Take my appreciation instead.", "He said her family is actually anti his converting just for marriage and has accepted it because she will \"make\" her kids Jewish. But that he is interested in converting for other reasons, which he hasn't shared that much about. I don't know if when he goes there they are pressuring him into it.  I'll love him no matter what religion he is but do expect that respect be mutual and not conditional.", "I don't know. But apparently she's not only still in the relationship, but she's still also in a close relationship with her father. So apparently she got away with the boyfriend but didn't think she could get away with the church?", "https://www.jewishboston.com/read/ask-a-rabbi-is-it-a-mitzvah-to-get-drunk-on-purim/\n\n>\tIn the Babylonian Talmud we find the following statement: Rava said, \u201cOne is obligated to drink on Purim until one doesn\u2019t know the difference between \u2018cursed be Haman\u2019 and \u2018blessed be Mordechai.\u2019\u201d\n\n>\tPurim is not about overcoming inhibitions in order to feel unconstrained in pursuit of our desires. Rather, it is about seeing the world from a fresh angle and unlocking a deeper kind of knowledge. Thus the religious value in drinking on Purim is more a matter of intention than of degree of inebriation. As Rabbi Isserles continues in his code: \u201cDrinking more or drinking less are equally good, provided one intends one\u2019s heart to heaven.\u201d", "It\u2019s really bizarre how insistent you\u2019re being about this. Multiple people have gone out of their way to explain to you that the view on alcohol in Judaism is different than what you seem to think and instead of accepting new information from people who know more about it than you, you\u2019re digging in. This makes me think that you\u2019re likely being unreasonable about the rest of this situation and are probably the AH here.", "First of all, Jews don\u2019t call it the Old Testament, but the Torah.\n\nSecond, even in the gospels, alcohol consumption is encouraged, as in the episode of the wedding at Cana.  \n\nThird, alcohol consumption is explicitly commanded on at least one holiday in the Tanach, and although modern interpretations of this can differ(1), I\u2019m not aware of any verses outright forbidding it and many verses that mention it positively.  \n\nFourth, asking \u2018why God would require something that is unhealthy\u2019 begs the question \u2018does God have anything to do with these words written on paper by different human beings at different times\u2019? as well as the question \u2018would it be possible for human beings to make sense of choices made by a deity as conceptualized by traditional religion, I.e., infinite, all powerful, and outside of time?\u2019\n\n(1) mostly along the lines of \u2018do we have to actually get super drunk or is getting nicely buzzed enough\u2019 or \u2018how should we reconcile this command with the responsibility of setting a good example for young people\u2019", "\u201cAll fundamentalists\u201d is an absurd statement. You\u2019re just wrong on this", "And how would she feel if you didn't go to her wedding.?\n\nHer respect for you should be mutual too.", "She *could* get away with attending the wedding. No way dating the brother which is a huge no-no by her own admission is less of a red line than entering a church. The only difference is Mandy wanted to drink and date the brother but doesn\u2019t care much about OP, and it shows", "Sorry, two out of three fundamentalist abrahamic religions do but hers magically does not. If I say two out of three people believe x, generally that means the consensus is x.", "Exactly! Imagine if my family said to her we can't go into a Jewish Church because it's not what my parents allow? We'd be called antisemites.", "You're making pretty much all of this up. You don't know what her father thinks of either her boyfriend or of attending a church service. You have no idea what she could get away with without having a rift with her family, but you're saying it as if you had data from the stars. That makes no sense. \n\nIt's probably true that Mandy is more willing to stand down her father on the subject of continuing to date the man she loves than she is on the subject of going into a church on one occasion for her friends' wedding, but that hardly means she doesn't much care about her friend. It does mean that she cares more about keeping her boyfriend than being at one day's occasion for her friend, but who wouldn't?? Are you saying that you would rather break up with somebody you love than miss a friend's wedding?", "I LITERALLY gave you evidence that shows that Jews don't forbid alcohol. In fact, it's a mitzvah to drink for some holidays. Abramahic religions aren't a democracy, they're independent and have their own beliefs. And you know there are more than 3 Abrahamic religions, right? Did you get votes from the Baha'i, the Druze, the Rastafarians?", "I would do neither simply because my dad in a cult dislikes my presence in a building. She\u2019s an adult and her stance reflects her thoughts. She has a right to not attend the ceremony, OP has a right to (correctly) infer Mandy doesn\u2019t give that much of a rat\u2019s fuck about her and break the relationship off", "You're missing the point. You said that she's wrong for prioritizing her relationship with her boyfriend over her friend's wedding. I asked whether you would give up your relationship for a friend's wedding. This isn't about the father, it's about which is more important. You're acting as if she should have treated her friend's wedding as more important than her relationship, but few of us would do that, and I doubt very much you would either."]}
