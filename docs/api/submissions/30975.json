My situation pertains to my daughter wanting to keep a secret from Linda.\n\nOur daughter has always dressed more tomboyish; we didn\u2019t encourage her, we let her pick what she wanted at clothing stores. So she has never had much interest in \u2018girly\u2019 clothes. \n\nToday, I walked past the laundry room to find Clara holding up my wife\u2019s bra with a very interested expression.

I don\u2019t want her to know!\u201d She waited for me to promise, which I did, and then bolted upstairs to her room.\n\nGiven how loud she screamed, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her brother in his room knew something was up. But the situation gave me thoughts that she was perhaps feeling the struggles of puberty. And I wanted to let Linda know, just as we discussed and actioned helping Jon through his physical and emotional struggles of growing up. More so me helping, so I wanted Linda to help Clara through hers.\n\nBut given how vehemently Clara didn\u2019t want Linda to know, I am having second thoughts that I may be breaching Clara\u2019s trust. I\u2019m debating on easing the conversation through by mentioning that Clara went through Linda\u2019s laundry, and then broaching the subject about the bra.

She already knows you know. Let her know that you're there for her and she can talk to you and you can buy her what she needs, but that her Mom knows more about bras and might be the better person to talk to. Ask why she doesn't want mom to know. (Is mom the type of person to gush over \"my baby's first bra\" or something?) Are kids at school talking? And that you are there for her for any other uncomfortable topics.\n\n\nWhy she doesn't want her brother to know is obvious.\n\n\nIs she starting to show need for a bra? Does she do sports?", "You can keep your promise to your daughter by not mentioning the laundry scene at all. She is growing up, you don't need the story to \"ease\" the conversation with your wife about that. You can talk about your daughter without needing pretext. So I think YWBTA if you use the story when you don't have to.", "I am worried that this is such an issue. What lives you live so that just looking at a piece of clothing can inflict commotion? Apparently it's time to speak with Clara, and no need to tell this exact case to your wife. YWBTA if you tell her, but find a way to let your daughter know it's not a big deal.", "INFO: Has your wife overreacted on the children in the past, for example by harshly punishing them or getting into screaming matches with them? Or has she tried to police the children's clothes in the past - or tried to get Clara to dress more feminine?", "Talk to your daughter. Why do you need to involve your wife?", "YTA if you break your promise to your daughter. However, that doesn't mean that you can't have a conversation with your wife about Clara and the fact that she is approaching puberty.\n\nIt would be reasonable whether you had seen her or not, for you and/or your wife to be talking to Clara, thinking about things such as whether to start offering her the option to go shopping for a bra, talking to her about menstruation and all the other things that go along with puberty.\n\nI would suggest leaving it a week or so so it's not obviously linked to her having been looking at her mom's laundry .  If it would be plausible, maybe hang it off something like 'one of my friends at work mentioned she'd taken her daughters shopping to get her first bra, which made me think we should talk about that kind of thing with you'  \n\nIt's worth the conversation including the fact that bras come in lots of different styles and it's fine, and perfectly possible, to have very plain, sports type bras or bralettes as well as fancier, more traditionally lacy / fancier ones, and to wear a fancier one under  less ' girly' clothes or a plainer one under fancier clothes, if she wants to .\n\nBut I think you need to keep your promise to her - she needs to know you can be trusted, and you can find ways to support her and have the necessary conversations with betraying her trust . You can even be direct with Clara. say something like \"I'm not going to tell you Mom or Jon I saw you looking at your Mom's bra in the laundry, because you 'asked me not to. But I want you to know there's nothing wrong with that - you're growing up, it's normal and natural for you to be curious, and neither you mom, nor I, will be mad at you. But I do want to talk to your mom to make sure that we can answer any questions you have about growing older, and so I am going to suggest to her that you and she have a chat about those things, and whether and when you want to start thinking about getting some bras of your own for when you feel you want to wear them'  That way, you are reassuring her that you aren't going to betray her confidence but also letting her know that you are going to talk to her om more generally and that she is OK to talk to either or both of you , and that her curiosity is totally normal and not something she needs to feel embarrassed about.", "NAH. Your daughter is embarrassed but at 12, she should at least be introduced to training bras. I don't see why the laundry search has to be brought up at all. If you can find a natural way to bring up that even though she's a tomboy, it might be time to introduce daughter to basic female undergarments, then you're not breaking your promise.", "YWBTA\n\nDemonstrate she can trust you with a secret.

And maybe tell her that it would also be okay, if she would prefer to talk to other adults and not her parents.

However, I\u2019d also add that you should tell her that if she\u2019s uncomfortable actually talking about it she could write it down for you to read or text you. I found things really, really hard to discuss when I was a teenager but could cope with writing it down. So I\u2019d text my mum if I needed pads or something because telling her was too overwhelming. Good luck!", "YWBTA. She didn\u2019t want you to say anything so why would you?

I saved my pocket money and bought my first 32aa training bra. Never told a soul.

Instead of wondering if you should tell your wife, a door was left unlocked and you were the one who discovered it. \n\nI\u2019d say go to your daughter and engage in a dialogue safely with her. Let her know you\u2019re sorry for walking in on her (even through it wasn\u2019t intentional, as she\u2019s probably feeling her personal space was compromised) and let her know you\u2019re here and want her to have a safe space with a parent to talk about what she\u2019s going through and experiencing. \n\nIf she\u2019s resistant, you can also encourage her to go to her mom. And let her know that it\u2019s a really good idea to do that as well. There are a lot of single and divorced fathers who have to take the lead with their children of the opposite sex. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t look at it as keeping a secret from your spouse, frame it instead as respecting your daughter boundaries", "NTA. Clara will need your wife's assistance as she goes through puberty, tom-boy or not. Tom-boys still get boobs and menstruation and all the other changes, your body goes through.", "NTA your daughter should be wearing bras at 12 not looking at them like they are something she has never seen before.", "YTA.  I doubt this story is true.  A 12 year old girl has a full-blown panic attack resulting in screaming and begging you to keep a secret.  Over a nothing burger.  The fricking laundry.  Yawn.\n\nBut in case this isn't a troll.  YTA for assuming anything about your daughter without (duh) talking to your daughter.  And YTA for even thinking about talking to your wife, for multiple reasons.  First, what would you say?  You have maybe 5% of the full story.  And revealing that much would be a clear breach of trust, with no guarantee of any positive result.\n\nBasically, if you are too timid to approach your daughter and ask her what's up, then keep your mouth shut.", "It is absolutely normal for girls to wear the clothes of their mother.\n\nThe mothers are the role models for girls.\n\nYou should have said her that it is o.k.", "NTA - but save the story for when she brings her first boyfriend home for dinner - the look on her face will be priceless. \ud83d\ude43", "Nope. NTA.\n\nImo, it'd be a mild YTA from keeping this from your wife. There is a scale to all things and I think the severity scale on this is so low; what impact would this have on Clara by you telling your wife who also parents her?\n\nObviously it's common sense to keep it from Clara that you told mum.", "No need to be so direct. I would not tell your wife that you saw her looking through her laundry; you could just mention to your wife / ask her, if maybe it's time to start looking into getting her a bra as you think she may be subtly curious about it. If she asks more, you can say you don't want to betray Clara's confidence, but perhaps your wife can find some time to talk to Clara, or just go shopping with her and whoops they're in the lingerie area. Mind, perhaps Clara would be interested in a more sports-bra / bralette as opposed to lacy, so I'd go to a place with a variety of options. Or maybe she'd be interested in something more girly, even if she still prefers to have her regular clothes to be tomboy-ish. NTA for thinking wife ought to know that Clara is growing up and may be interested in a bra, without explicitly mentioning that she'd been looking through her laundry.

I mean if suddenly she starts wearing a bra, your wife WILL notice. Explain to your daughter that her knowing ahead of time will keep it from being so stressful.  \n\nBut that depends on why she was looking at the bra.

This moment seems small but the effects of it are likely to be long lasting.", "I would also suggest that, maybe, he could talk about it with her daughter in private, maybe she is struggling with puberty, maybe she doesnt know if you leans more into being a girl or a boy, maybe she doesnt know if she likes boys or girls, etc. There could be a lot of reasons why she could be staring at your wife\u00b4s bra, and maybe it doesnt have to do with \"growing up\", maybe she was just shock by the side of them.\n\nIf it is related to puberty or sexuality, then OP should tell her to maybe talk to her mother, as she may know better how to help her and handle better the situation, but whatever the daughter decides, OP should not tell his wife, helping then build that safe place so they can both talk better in the future.", "This is the answer!!!!", "My kids do this with my husband (their step father)  My kids are very protective of me and do not like me to worry so they will tell him things that they think I will worry about.", "Good point. Dad can have this conversation with her too. It doesn\u2019t have to be mom. He can even say, \u201cI think it\u2019s time one of us talked to you about bras. It can be me or mom: you choose. If you would rather talk to mom, I can tell her that without telling her about the laundry thing. If you would rather talk to me, I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d", "I come from a completely normal family and would have been mortified as an 11 year old if my dad found me holding/staring at my mum's bra. My brother definitely would have teased me about it. Anything to do with puberty is embarrassing. \n\nRemember that \"bra\" is literally a dirty word to a lot of 11 year olds (not that it should be.) They're like the holy grail of adulthood to little girls like that. At 11 me and my friends thought owning a bottle of victoria's secret *body spray* was like...the height of sophistication and scandal. Lmao.", "This is the way", "Mmm, some parents will not admit their kids need that info until it's significantly later than it should have been. Looks like OP's wife missed the best time to start that conversation.", "Wow, you have clearly never dealt with 12 year old girls.  This is *exactly* the type of thing they freak out about.", "Oh you clearly missed out on [this VERY ACCURATE gem from my childhood](https://youtu.be/ORRJA4ZdcdQ?si=2hGB_jtxQ2HAwD5-) bras are embarrassing when you\u2019re in middle school. Poking around your moms is doubly so. Puberty is weird and awkward and it feels like you\u2019re doing something wrong/taboo 90% of the time just because, outside of being an \u201cadult thing\u201d, it\u2019s unfamiliar.", "I linked this to the same comment you\u2019re replying to but thought I\u2019d share with you as well. [This is an absolute gem of a scene and painfully spot on](https://youtu.be/ORRJA4ZdcdQ?si=2hGB_jtxQ2HAwD5-)"]}
