None of it was about us as a couple, just family health crisis and then a small car accident. All has been mostly fine up until the last 2-3weeks.\n\nMy husband snores RIDICULOUSLY loud. I knew this before marrying him, but I didn\u2019t know just how much it would affect my sleep until our honeymoon. We have bought everything possible to help with the snoring, and so far so good but ONLY if he stays on his left side specifically. He has an appointment scheduled in January to have his throat looked at, but until then this is what we have to do in order for us to both get some sleep\u2026.or so I thought.\n\nFor the last 2-3 weeks, I have barely slept because he will end up on his back (which is when his snoring is the loudest) and will NOT roll back over. He sleep talks, so he will fully acknowledge what I say and agree to roll over, but NEVER does. He will have no memory of the night\u2019s events either. I am literally writing this on 2 days of no sleep.\n\nTonight, I snapped. All I wanted to do after coming home from work was go to sleep (I am a first responder so my shifts can be and usually are exhausting). Instead, I ended up yelling at him because he said he was going to go to bed early, despite the fact that I literally do not sleep if he falls asleep first because of his snoring. I admit, I said everything with a ton of anger in my voice, but I am EXHAUSTED. I know that is nothing more than an excuse, but I don\u2019t have the energy to even care. I ended up threatening to move back to my parent\u2019s house until his appointment so I could get some sleep. He did not take that well and now we are not speaking. Did I go too far? Would that be an unreasonable thing to do? I can\u2019t even think straight because I\u2019m so tired and I\u2019m scared at this point that it will affect my work performance, which can be deadly for someone in crisis.\n\nEDIT: adding that we only have a 1 bedroom apartment so there\u2019s no spare room. I also cannot sleep on the couch due to scoliosis issues and he won\u2019t because he is afraid he will stop breathing and I won\u2019t know. He has only ever stopped breathing once but that\u2019s enough for the both of us. Also, I would only be moving out until his doctor\u2019s appointment where we can have a treatment plan started.\n\nEDIT #2: okay maybe this wasn\u2019t clear, but when I said we\u2019ve bought everything to help with the snoring, I also meant that I have bought things to help me sleep. Y\u2019all really think I wouldn\u2019t have jumped straight to earplugs??? Come on now. If it were that easy, I wouldn\u2019t be posting this on Reddit. On a side note, thank you to everyone who has recommended different brands for me to try and for all the other suggestions! Y\u2019all are awesome!!!\n\nEDIT #3: Okay so I know I need to apologize for a lot of things here, specifically my tone and for threatening to leave rather than calmly talking about that even being an option. I\u2019m not going anywhere for now so he won\u2019t be alone in case he does stop breathing again (god forbid). Thank you everyone for all your input!!!

You desperately need some sleep and he's not keeping you awake on purpose. He needs to book in for a sleep study ASAP as it sounds like he has sleep apnea.

Your husband may have sleep apnoea or a myriad of other reasons for his snoring.  \n\nHave you made an appointment for him for a sleep study?  Or is it just an ENT you are seeing.  If you haven't made that appointment, make one as even the ENT will request one.  At least you'll have the appointment (if lucky you may even have gotten results before the ENT).

You\u2019ve reached the end of your rope, and you feel like you are trapped. All your feelings and emotions are completely valid. NTA for how you feel.\n\nHowever, how you handled it is TAH. You don\u2019t have to apologize for how you feel, but you do owe him an apology for how you behaved. And threatening to move out probably made him feel very attacked and defensive. Especially so early in your marriage. I feel like you need to instantly walk that back and reassure him that you aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nI don\u2019t have any great solutions for you. I have had roommates who snore so loud that the walls shake. I have also had to share a room with eight people, and two of them were horrid snorers.

If I can't sleep due to his snoring I just poke him a bit, normally moving just stops it.", "So my mom and grandma snored like a freight train and I used to share a room with my mom so Jesus I know your pain love, what worked for my mom was having a sleep study done and then from there she got a CPAP machine and the noise of the machine will hopefully lull you to sleep, it\u2019s not loud at all and it kind of hums. Helped mom stop snoring and I had a little noise to sleep to. So we both ended up winning so to speak. Get that man a CPAP machine \ud83d\ude02", "Similar situation, including the conversing and not remembering.  I have used that to my advantage.  I get him to roll over or push him over.  He doesn't remember in the morning.", "NAH I understand you completely. My dad is a HORRIBLE SNORER. I used to sleep near my parents bedroom and would have trouble falling asleep or wake up in the middle of the night because of his snoring. Now I sleep on another floor thank god. Recently we went on a trip and stayed overnight in a family hotel room. I couldn't sleep for the life of me. I was so tired from the driving, as was everyone, but his snoring was so loud that I just stayed up for hours until his snoring stopped long enough for me to fall asleep. I nearly cried & my sister ACTUALLY cried because she couldnt fall asleep LOL. Anyways I think it's good that he's going to the doctors and I hope all will be well for you guys stay strong!", "You need sleep, it\u2019s an essential part of overall health.  NTA, but it\u2019s scary to think of your husband not breathing.", "NTA, but if his snoring is that bad and he is stopping breathing then he needs a sleep study, a cpap machine and to lose weight.\n\nIt sounds like sleep apnea and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n\nHe shouldnt be afraid of dying because he slept on the lounge, he needs medical help.", "Use pillows to keep him on his left side. Aka a pillow barrier to prevent him from rolling over.\n  \nAlso it sounds even if you had another room your husband won't let you go to it. Look at his response to sleeping on the couch. He won't let you sleep in another room. \n\nAlso just a quick fyi. If you do not get sleep you will snap more often and your health will deteriorate. For your health please go get some sleep where you can. Continuous lack of sleep has been linked to health problems.", "NTA\n\nSleep deprivation is torture. I know you said the couch isn\u2019t an option for either of you, but could you sleep on an air mattress or a regular small mattress in the living room until he gets it checked out? Because this is no way to live.", "My mom forced my dad to do a sleep study before he retired from the military. Turns out he has sleep apnea and has been on a cpap machine ever since.", "And OP\u2019s belief that she can hold him to what he says in his sleep is also wildly dismissive. \n\nWith a sleep disorder, the sleeping patient often doesn\u2019t have any control or memory of what they do in their sleep", "Easier said than done.", "Yes. He just doesn\u2019t want to be alone is the main thing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I sent my husband for a sleep study. Unfortunately snoring does not qualify you for a machine. You have to stop breathing multiple times. He snores but does not stop breathing enough to qualify. Taping a tennis ball on the back of his shirt helps. And he is nice enough to go sleep in the chair when I ask. We make it work. He has to fast occasionally for his job for weigh in, and for those few weeks he rarely snores. Is your husband a guy that could lose 10 pounds? That sometimes helps.", "Sounds very like sleep apnea, have you tried getting him to a sleep clinic?", "My fiance gained a bit of weight during the pandemic and started snoring like him. She woke up every time she stopped breathing.\n\nTo be fair, you're more at risk of a heart attack than asphyxiation. Thats the think sleep apnea patients dont get- your heart has to jump start your body to get you breathing/awake, and this tears and toughens tissue.\n\nIts rare and happens mostly to the elderly that don't address speep apnea, but it happens. He will be fine wherever he is.", "What did he do before yall were living together?  Was he scared to sleep then", "Yeah he can move to the couch. His choices are him in the bed and you at your parents or him on the couch and you in the bed. If he\u2019s actually worried about a brief apnea episode the one where you are in the same home seems better. \n\nSnoring sucks. People who snore don\u2019t realize how negatively it effects both them and everyone around them till they get it solved. They\u2019ve shown that CPAP machines can help folks lose weight since they are breathing and resting properly.", "My husband snores like that if he's on his left side. He has a deviated septum and it snaps shut when he rolls to the left. He's having surgery next year and I'm thrilled to tiny pieces. I'd apologize for losing your temper but honestly, NTA.", "But if you leave to your parents he\u2019ll also be alone. So he should move to the couch. Also wedge a pillow in his back to keep him on his side and if he does roll on back feel free to roll him or poke him. My hubby pokes me to wake me up just enough that I grumble and roll on my side. It works.", "Also it\u2019s likely he\u2019s stopping breathing multiple times a night. My sleep study showed 11 events of not breathing for 10 seconds. It\u2019s not unusual. Call the doctor and ask but I doubt he\u2019ll die.", "Can you get a pull down bed - like the ones hotels use when you want an extra bed in the room? Ps. NTA", "Get a small wedge pillow and put it under your bottom sheet so it can't be moved or tossed off. Basically get him to lay down on your bed with no sheets on, on his left hand side where the doesn't snore. Shove the wedge pillow against/under his back and have him shift around a bit to find the best placement for it to stop him from comfortably rolling onto his back, then make your bed over/around it. The tension on the bottom sheet from both of your weight should stop it from moving, it gives his body a surface to rest against that tells his mind \"I can't roll over\" and hopefully should help keep him on that side while you get this sorted out.", "See if they'll let him do an at-home study while waiting for the in-office study! My husband got to pick up a kit and take it home to do some of the preliminary study.", "Get him a Fitbit watch the higher end model that tracks sleep and oxygen they store data in app and send emails that his doctor can see a pattern to it.", "He's TA because he won't go sleep in the couch so OP can get some sleep. Her sleep and rest don't matter-- this amounts to torture of the OP.", "If you are asleep next to him and he stops breathing, how would you wake up? Presumably, he would be making less noise in that circumstance, so you would sleep even better, no? I'm not sure I understand how you being next to him the full night is actually going to keep him safe, unless you are awake the whole time to monitor him.", "My mom did something like this once for my dad - I think it was after he'd had surgery on his retinas and wasn't supposed to sleep on his back for a few weeks.", "My husband tried a mouthguard for sleep apnea. Didn\u2019t help a bit. Cpap works wonders though.", "I use an incline pillow to help reduce overnight acid reflux. They're really helpful for a lot of things!", "Those things are AWESOME.  I used one for the first six months after breast reduction surgery.", "Yay!  \n\nLess weight on his throat surely helped.", "How would she know if he stopped breathing even if they were in the same bed? She would be literally sleeping, if she manages to fall asleep. For all they know this wasn't the only time, it was the only time she saw it.", "Like OP, I also need to fall asleep before my husband, otherwise his snoring keeps me awake. If he starts snoring after I've fallen asleep, I'm already asleep and won't be bothered. \n\nIf OP is already asleep, OP isn't going to know if her husband stops breathing in the middle of the night. So the whole expectation that OP is supposed to wake him up if he stops breathing is kind of ridiculous.", "If he has sleep apnea, he's definitely stopped breathing more than once. It likely occurs multiple times a night. Has he been made aware of this? It's honestly silly to me. My partner has sleep apnea (and a CPAP now) and in the beginning when we were dating I would just casually tell him \"hey, you stopped breathing a in your sleep a few times last night\". Hes a lot more likely to die from a heart attack, stroke or hypertensive crisis due to the sleep apnea than he is if he stops breathing a few times in his sleep.\n\nI'm going with NTA. Maybe you could've said it nicer or maybe he needed to hear it as you said it to understand how absolutely fucking draining it is to sleep beside someone that snores louder than a fucking motorcycle.", "How did he sleep alone before he met you?", "The weight of the uterus and fetus after 28 weeks compresses the vena cava, a MAJOR artery, blocking blood flow enough to threaten the fetus.", "It increases the risk of lots of things during pregnancy. So pregnant woman are supposed to sleep on their side.", "In the third ish trimester, or sooner depending on a lot of factors,the weight of the baby and uterus can put too much pressure on a major artery that runs along your spine. Compressing it for too long (no way of knowing how long too long is unfortunately) increases your risk of delivering stillborn.", "The same reason I can't sleep when any other small mammal is crushing my internal organs", "My husband swears by Mack\u2019s Snore Blocker earplugs.\n\nBetween now and January, do whatever you have to do to get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation is banned under international law as a form of torture. (I\u2019m not suggesting that your husband be prosecuted at The Hague; I\u2019m making the point that your suffering is real and substantial.)\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that sleeping on the sofa will cause your husband to stop breathing and not start again. I have both obstructive sleep apnea (I can\u2019t breathe because my throat closes) and central apnea (I stop breathing for who knows what reason), and recordings my husband made before I was able to get a CPAP sound horrific, but I wasn\u2019t in danger of suffocating.", "The turning over part. Not the snoring part. Like when he wakes up slightly, agrees to turn over and doesn't. That one. Not the snoring part.", "Without his sleep apnea machine, my spouse stops breathing 60-70 times an hour. Five times an hour is considered normal for adults. There's no need to panic if an adult stops beating a couple times in the night.\n\nIf you are awake often enough to notice when your bedmate stops breathing, it's likely you have a sleep disorder of your own.", "It's serious and cumulative. Untreated sleep apnea is what the doctors pinpointed as the beginning of his heart failure", "Doesn't help if he has sleep apnea, before I was diagnosed it didn't matter where or how I lay I snored and badly", "I didn't see it, but will a body position pillow help? They make some sleep bolster and maternity ones designed to keep ppl turned to the side overnight. If overpriced pillows aren't in the budget. Rolled blankets/ duvets shoved in a long pillowcase or fitted sheet mimic it. \n\nBest wishes with solving this\n\nNTA, you need sleep.", "Okay, he might not be sleeping great either, but he's *used* to his sleep patterns. You're not, you are exhausted and it's new."]}
