None of it was about us as a couple, just family health crisis and then a small car accident. All has been mostly fine up until the last 2-3weeks.\n\nMy husband snores RIDICULOUSLY loud. I knew this before marrying him, but I didn\u2019t know just how much it would affect my sleep until our honeymoon. We have bought everything possible to help with the snoring, and so far so good but ONLY if he stays on his left side specifically. He has an appointment scheduled in January to have his throat looked at, but until then this is what we have to do in order for us to both get some sleep\u2026.or so I thought.\n\nFor the last 2-3 weeks, I have barely slept because he will end up on his back (which is when his snoring is the loudest) and will NOT roll back over. He sleep talks, so he will fully acknowledge what I say and agree to roll over, but NEVER does. He will have no memory of the night\u2019s events either. I am literally writing this on 2 days of no sleep.\n\nTonight, I snapped. All I wanted to do after coming home from work was go to sleep (I am a first responder so my shifts can be and usually are exhausting). Instead, I ended up yelling at him because he said he was going to go to bed early, despite the fact that I literally do not sleep if he falls asleep first because of his snoring. I admit, I said everything with a ton of anger in my voice, but I am EXHAUSTED. I know that is nothing more than an excuse, but I don\u2019t have the energy to even care. I ended up threatening to move back to my parent\u2019s house until his appointment so I could get some sleep. He did not take that well and now we are not speaking. Did I go too far? Would that be an unreasonable thing to do? I can\u2019t even think straight because I\u2019m so tired and I\u2019m scared at this point that it will affect my work performance, which can be deadly for someone in crisis.\n\nEDIT: adding that we only have a 1 bedroom apartment so there\u2019s no spare room. I also cannot sleep on the couch due to scoliosis issues and he won\u2019t because he is afraid he will stop breathing and I won\u2019t know. He has only ever stopped breathing once but that\u2019s enough for the both of us. Also, I would only be moving out until his doctor\u2019s appointment where we can have a treatment plan started.\n\nEDIT #2: okay maybe this wasn\u2019t clear, but when I said we\u2019ve bought everything to help with the snoring, I also meant that I have bought things to help me sleep. Y\u2019all really think I wouldn\u2019t have jumped straight to earplugs??? Come on now. If it were that easy, I wouldn\u2019t be posting this on Reddit. On a side note, thank you to everyone who has recommended different brands for me to try and for all the other suggestions! Y\u2019all are awesome!!!\n\nEDIT #3: Okay so I know I need to apologize for a lot of things here, specifically my tone and for threatening to leave rather than calmly talking about that even being an option. I\u2019m not going anywhere for now so he won\u2019t be alone in case he does stop breathing again (god forbid). Thank you everyone for all your input!!!

Expressing those needs in a less than perfect manner does not make your needs any less valid. Does your husband really prioritize his feelings over your most basic physical well-being? That's a selfish reaction on his part. \n\nBeyond that, this situation has already become unsustainable. If you don't get sleep soon, irritability is the least of the symptoms you'll have. Your husband should be willing to work with you to find a solution, rather than expect you to just not sleep for the next month. NTA.", "NAH. You desperately need some sleep and he's not keeping you awake on purpose. He needs to book in for a sleep study ASAP as it sounds like he has sleep apnea.

Buy a second bed if you need but your sleep is very important just to function.\n\nIt's only temporary.  Your husband may have sleep apnoea or a myriad of other reasons for his snoring.  \n\nHave you made an appointment for him for a sleep study?  Or is it just an ENT you are seeing.  If you haven't made that appointment, make one as even the ENT will request one.  At least you'll have the appointment (if lucky you may even have gotten results before the ENT).  There's valuable info for that.\n\nAs you know, this is not deliberate.  He's got no idea what he's doing at night and it sounds like he's in a deep sleep if he's not responding to you shaking him (or whatever you need to do) to get him to roll over.\n\nYou could try a wedge to help keep him on his side.

You\u2019ve reached the end of your rope, and you feel like you are trapped. All your feelings and emotions are completely valid. NTA for how you feel.\n\nHowever, how you handled it is TAH. You don\u2019t have to apologize for how you feel, but you do owe him an apology for how you behaved. And threatening to move out probably made him feel very attacked and defensive. Especially so early in your marriage. I feel like you need to instantly walk that back and reassure him that you aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nI don\u2019t have any great solutions for you. I have had roommates who snore so loud that the walls shake. I have also had to share a room with eight people, and two of them were horrid snorers. So I definitely empathize with you on this! \n\nYou can get a bite guard that you mold to fit at home, that might help a little bit. But it\u2019s a dice roll.\n\nThings I have done that have helped is to take some melatonin so that I fall asleep quickly. Also, I use the earplugs that look a little like Christmas trees.

The wedge pillow is great for my heartburn too! Might be worth a try", "Try the silicone ones from Macks. Stays put because they mold to your outer ear (not ear canal). \n\nLifesaver. Marriage saver too. Imagine decades of this not just months. Just saying...", "My father snores really loudly so my mom invested in earplugs moulded specifically for her ears from a specialist place. They dont fall out and she sleeps through it all now", "Wake him up by throwing water every time the refusal happens. He's definitely doing it on purpose.", "All the best to you xx", "Then the only option left is earplugs", "I get that part, but that's also weeks away. What about an air mattress?", "> This comment just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me\u2026.He won\u2019t sleep on the couch because he\u2019s stopped breathing once before, is afraid it will happen again, and you won\u2019t know about it to help him.\n\nThat also seems to suggest that he expects her to spend all night awake enough to monitor his breathing. Not restful.", "No you\u2019re absolutely right! And I think that plays a huge part into why he\u2019s hurt about my comment because he would be alone and I would be willingly doing that to him. I wasn\u2019t thinking about that aspect when I said it, I was just thinking about what I could do to finally sleep.", "I will look them up now! Thank you so much!", "I will definitely look into it!!! Thank you so much!!!", "I\u2019m definitely purchasing them today!!! Thank you!!!!", "I will definitely talk to my doctor and see what he can do! Thank you!!!", "What a horrible thing to say, NOBODY snores on purpose if he's suffering from obstructive sleep apnea, when he falls asleep all the muscles in his throat relax so much they then block the throat/windpipe which then causes the snoring.", "See I honestly can\u2019t tell at this point if he is or not. Like I said, he talks in his sleep also so it isn\u2019t unusual for him to have full blown conversations despite being dead asleep. But again, I\u2019m so tired that idk if I care as long as it stops \ud83d\ude05", "I have them with noise canceling headphones. On a normal night when he\u2019s on his side, these two work amazing! But all bets seem off when he\u2019s on his back \ud83d\ude05", "We don\u2019t currently have one, but I will definitely buy one tomorrow and try that! I have scoliosis issues so it might not work, but I\u2019ll try anything at this point!", "if he actually died, her poor exhausted brain would finally go into about a dozen REM cycles and she wouldn\u2019t be able to save him anyway \ud83d\ude05", "Can you get him to agree to let you go to sleep first every night since that\u2019s the only way you can sleep until his appointment next month?", "He's slept alone before you married him. I don't understand why he is holding your sleep hijacked now? Sleep apnea does not just happen. He's probably been this way for years. I know that you've tried things for yourself but what about him. Has he tried any over the counter stuff?", "You'll need the 'quiet' version meant for sleep. They also do daytime ones that are designed to minimise external noise but you can still her conversation. Absolutely genius, I have both types and I bloody love them!", "Can also recommend the soft headbands with Bluetooth speakers so you can listen to soothing music or sounds. Perfect if you don\u2019t like to sleep with things in your ears.\n\nMy go to is music from the game Skyrim with rain and thunder sounds. I\u2019ve gone from taking an hour to fall asleep to being out in 15 mins, and that\u2019s without adding in my partner who also has sleep apnea. It doesn\u2019t entirely erase his snoring but with music and rain it simply becomes background noise and I\u2019m able to ignore it.", "I dont believe he\u2019s doing it on purpose. My husband snored to wake the dead. I was angry, exhausted, at wits end and was finally able to convince him to have a sleep study. Ends up he has a severe case of sleep apnea. He uses his machine, and it is much better (he still snores with his machine, but it\u2019s much more tolerable). Have your husband get a sleep study. You will be so thankful you did.\n\nNAH", "You are a difficult case, nothing seems to work here", "That\u2019s been our current agreement since the honeymoon, with the exception being when I have to work late (I don\u2019t get home until 3 AM in this case so of course I can\u2019t expect him to stay up that late waiting for me). That\u2019s why I snapped because to me it was like he was saying \u201cscrew you and your need for sleep\u201d. But others have pointed out that if it is sleep apnea, then he\u2019s not sleeping well either so he might be exhausted also. Idk, I didn\u2019t stop to think about it before I spoke so that\u2019s my fault.", "That sounds AMAZING! Thank you so so so much!", "We\u2019re waiting on his insurance now to get the sleep study approved, but I have no doubt he has some kind of sleep apnea. I just wish I could fix it now myself.", "I know. It\u2019s a lose-lose I feel like until we talk to the doctors to see what else we can do, but I don\u2019t want either of us to be losing so bad that we borderline hate each other because of this. Hopefully these brands that other people have suggested will work better though!", "It s difficult  to think  after not sleeping  and resting  so long, don't beat yourself up  for it. Can you put a baby monitor  near the couch  for him to sleep  there (if you really  need sleep  and can't otherwise) with the receiver near your head? Nah", "Good luck my friend. Oh, I forgot. NTA! It took me a long time to make OH realise what it was doing to me physically and psychologically, he's really good about it now though! He has nasal polyps and takes montelukhast and steroid nasal drops, which helps, but as soon as it's winter and there are colds about he's in the spare room \ud83e\udd23", "Do you have a recliner or can he sleep with multiple pillows under his head? This often helps with  obstructive sleep apnea. However, if it is central SA (brain does not properly signal you to breathe) it will not. Most sleep apnea is of the obstructive variety. Best of luck to both of you.", "I hope so, we are curious about your situation.", "He currently sleeps with 4 pillows and it usually helps a TON! I think he\u2019s just gotten uncomfortable in his sleep though and will slide down them when on his back, thus creating the insane snoring. We might have to try a steeper wedge though like someone mentioned!"]}
