Let's break this down, shall we?\n\nFirst, let's address the fact that being someone's maid of honor does not automatically make you their personal ATM. Your role is to support your friend emotionally and help with wedding planning, not to bankroll their extravagances. It's perfectly reasonable to have a budget for wedding-related expenses, and it's okay to stick to it.\n\nNow, let's talk about your friend. It's understandable that she wants the perfect wedding, but she should be aware of her budget and make decisions accordingly. Asking you to contribute $1,000 to her dress is a significant request, and it's not fair to expect you to cover that cost, especially when you've already spent money on other wedding-related activities.\n\nSo, are you an asshole for not wanting to pay for your friend's expensive wedding dress? Absolutely not. NTA. It's essential to prioritize your financial well-being and set boundaries with friends, even when they're walking down the aisle. Try explaining your situation to her calmly and honestly, and offer your support in other ways. If she's a true friend, she'll understand and appreciate your honesty.", "NTA.

It is not the bridesmaid's job to pay for a wedding dress. \n\nComments like this where the bridesmaid is being asked/required to pay for the bridesmaid's dress, bachelorette party, bridal shower and/or other expenses make me wonder whether the bride asked their friend to be bridesmaid because they wanted the friend in the wedding party, or because they wanted the friend to help foot the bills for the wedding. \n\nWhen you consider all the other expenses, being asked to contribute one-fifth of the cost of the bride's dress is just a cherry on top the very expensive \\[wedding\\] cake.", "NTA - that\u2019s wildly inappropriate and manipulative of your friend.", "Totally NTA.

If she gets pissed about that then you need to reevaluate whether or not she is your friend.", "NTA! That\u2019s an insanely unrealistic expectation, you absolutely shouldn\u2019t spend more than you can afford to on her wedding period.", "This is an absolutely INSANE request. I'm absolutely disgusted that anyone would think this behavior is acceptable. \n\nNTA, and I would have ended my involvement in the wedding. Likely the friendship, too.", "NTA, she is the one who is WRONG to ask you. She has no right, and this isn't what friends do to each other.", "NTA. This has nothing to fo with the other costs as MOH, the bottom line is it's not up to you to psy gor her dress! A dress is not a wedding gift and your gift to her is being MOH, you have spent money on shower and Bachelorette as well as presumably dress and hotel gir wedding.", "NTA!! Your friend\u2019s wedding budget is genuinely not your problem regardless of how close you guys are. Especially since you\u2019ve already kindly contributed your money in multiple different areas. If your friend doesn\u2019t understand that YOU need to put YOUR financial stability first, she\u2019s not a very good friend to begin with.", "NTA be  bachelorette party and bridal shower ARE her gifts. Expecting you to put 1000 in for her dress too is ridiculous", "Not the AH. No have her parents pay for it or her partner. You are not marrying her.", "That's crazy to expect that much nta", "NTA \n\nWhen did it become the bridal party\u2019s responsibility to bankroll the wedding??? No. She\u2019s gross for even asking.", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason to spend $5000 on a wedding dress.  No reason at all.  Expecting a friend to spend $1000 on the dress makes her the AH", "\"ATM of Honor\"", "I couldn't agree more.  I found my dress at a thrift store.  I absolutely loved it.  It still had the original tags on. Cost about $100. It's the MARRIAGE  that matters, not the wedding. 31 years later, still together.", "NTA\n\nYour friend, on the other hand, STA", "NTA\n\n>I've already spent a lot of money on the bachelorette party, bridal shower, and other wedding-related expenses, and I'm not sure I can afford to add another $1,000 to the tab\n\nYou have done more than enough. \n\nHer wedding dress should NOT be part of your cost to participate. That is HER COST and she should ask her relatives.\n\nYou are more than committed and having to help her pay for her dress is going above and beyond what should be required to participate in her wedding.\n\nINFO: Has she asked anyone else to help or JUST you? Any of the other bridesmaids? Her family? Fianc\u00e9s family?", "My one daighters dress cost $225. My youngest  daughter's dress cost $550.  Neither of them wanted to spend more than $500. \n$5000???? Are you kidding me???\nHow dare she ask you for any money and why you pay for all the other stuff by yourself.  Your friend is a grifter.", "NTA. OP would you ever ask a friend to make a contribution like that?? And would you let a friendship fall apart because some one said no to that request?? \n\nIf the answer is no to one or both of those questions, then you shouldn\u2019t need to lower the standards to allow friends to treat you in ways that you don\u2019t feel would be acceptable behavior from yourself", "NTA tell her to buy her own dress. Good grief", "NTA. Your friend is way out of line by trying to dun you for a dress that -- as you write -- will only be worn once and only for about three or four hours. It's unbelievable that she would also try to frame her request as an \"early\" wedding gift. Does the qualification of \"early\" mean that you'll also be expected to come up with a later wedding gift? You do not have to go into debt or deny yourself the use of YOUR money to appease your friend. Also bear in mind she didn't say she'd be \"upset\" if you didn't contribute or that refusal would jeopardize your friendship; these are assumptions you are making. That's the trick of bullies: they have you so conditioned that you drum up reasons why you must give in to avoid a confrontation that hasn't even been spoken of. Also bear in mind that if the friendship is damaged because you can't afford to fork out $1K, it may not have been that profound a friendship in the first place.", "You will be an ahole one way or the other. The question is - do you want to be an actual IRL ahole to yourself financially, or do you want to be an ahole (only in your friend's mind) because you didn't add a thousand dollar gift on top of the hundreds of dollars and hours of time you have already given her? You are going to have to live with the consequences of your choice - being an impoverished doormat or having her decide you are a poor friend (even though you are not) and be upset with you.\n\nYou can't escape experiencing something you don't like, but you can decide which unpleasantness is better for you in the long run.", "NTA", "I don't need to read past the first paragraph. Your friend is a huge AH, I would be thinking about whether I wanted to continue being friends!", "NTA. I don't know why brides decided that the honor of being a maid of honor or bridesmaid means they can spend your money. I suggest declining the gift and declining being the maid of honor. I'm sure she is going to want you to spend another thousand on her bachelorette.", "\"Oh, so you \\*haven't\\* found the PERFECT dress, because you haven't found one in your budget.  I guess you need to keep looking.\"  There's a reason those \"Say Yes\" salespeople only bring out the dresses in the bride's budget.  NTA", "NTA and I'm starting to wonder where this attitude from some brides come from. Are they looking at Pinterest and thinking that it's normal? Just name some poor friend as MOH and expect them to shell out thousands of dollars for one day? \n\nMan, I hope nobody ever asks me to do that. That's like half my mortgage payment for what she wants for the dress alone! They'd  be sorely disappointed by me.", "Maybe offer to start a gofundme or similar instead.", "NTA, that's a ridiculous thing for her to even think about asking for!!", "NTA. And she's not being a good friend. Raise your standards.", "*My friend is a little bit of a bridezilla...*\n\nThat's an understatement if there ever was one. Most wedding gifts are well under $1,000 and here she is trying to get a money grab out of you over her wedding dress. If your friend insists on haranguing you over this matter, hold on to your wallet and drop out of the wedding party. NTA", "And if you need a little extra starch for your spine consider that she\u2019ll likely \n\n- a) use your contribution, should you make it, to justify her behavior and bully others financially as well (\u201cbut u/Budget_Classroom is chipping in! you have to too!\u201d) and\n\n- b) feel entirely comfortable spending your money instead of her own on future occasions (baby shower anyone?). \n\nAlso, what does \u201ccan\u2019t afford it\u201d mean here? It means she wants to spend the money she\u2019d spend on that dress on something else (the honeymoon, the hall, the cake, the photog, whatever). Well, so do you want to spend that $1000 on something else (groceries, heat, next year\u2019s vacation, gas, a spa day). Why should her wants trump yours for *your* money?", "Such a. Age old take there was another just like it last month...", "I'm so confused by the existence of people like the bride who feel entitled enough to ask for something like this.  I've never encountered anyone IRL who would make such a request.  It blows my mind!", "It is a possible way to work out how much you value each other though: \n\nBride: Will you pay $1000 ? \n\nMOH: I don't like you that much. \n\nBride: How about $200? \n\nMOH: How about $14.50?\n\nBride - throw in a pack of M&Ms and we split some wings? \n\nMOH: Deal.", "Nope. NTA", "NTA.  If your friend is willing to break off your friendship because you didn't just hand over a thousand dollars that you don't have because she couldn't pick a dress within her budget, then that is really not a friendship worth keeping. Tell her no, if she accepts your answer and leaves you alone, great.  If she doesn't and starts harassing you and haranguing you that you need to pony up the money so she can have her \"perfect\" wedding, then you will know where you stand with her, which is that she is treating you as an extra bank account and that the value of your friendship is $1000.  Don't let yourself become a doormat to your friend.", "Jeez! I don't think my sister even paid 1000.00 for her dress and she looked stunning in it. (I'm not married, so never bought one for myself)\n\nNTA\n\n1000.00 is a huge amount of money.", "NTA. Just tell her you're on a budget, and her wedding dress isn't in it.", "NTA at all. There are so many of these ridiculous wedding expectations posts. People are just losing their minds over having a \u201cperfect\u201d wedding day, the most amazing destination bachelorette, a curated bridal shower, over the top engagement parties. And expecting everyone else to put in their time, money and mental energy to make sure it happens for them. But if you can\u2019t do it or say, no, then you don\u2019t love them. FFS! It\u2019s too much!! Ahhhh - rant over.", "Absolutely NTA. You have to draw the line somewhere. This is an excellent spot.", "NTA, but be ready for the consequences if you don\u2019t contribute. She sounds pretty selfish imo (edit for typo)", "If the dress is out of her budget, then it\u2019s not the perfect dress. NTA", "I ordered my dress online for $200 and paid another 50 to get it altered. It's a truly beautiful dress. It's not as good a deal as yours but not outrageous either. I agree that it is definitely the marriage that matters. Our wedding cost around 1,100 total lol and it was perfect for us", "NTA! She is\u2026 she\u2019s basically telling you that after the expensive wedding related functions you contributed to, she wants another $1000, for a dress that she\u2019ll wear once? Just say NO.", "From a clear perspective, the bride is clearly in the wrong. You have to look at this relationship long term, is this a relationship you want to keep? Is this a relationship that you will benefit from in the future? Is the relationship willing to continue if you tell her straightly no to help pay? \n\nSeeming as though this friendship has gone on for a decade there has to have been strong factors that have kept you so close. So is this bride a 'bridezilla' because of her personality which might be based on narcism or OCD or any other mental disorders or is this just caused by the stress of the wedding and really wanting it to be perfect?\n\nBut of course, we do not know her as a person and therefore this decision has to come from you.", "You should not be paying for ANY of this stuff. It's her wedding. She should pay for her own wedding. NTA", "NTA. Don't feel guilty! If she can't afford it she should even have looked at it. Or if she is so in love with it she might be able to find a seamstress to make her a similar one with cheaper fabric.\nAlso, does she really think a wedding gift should be 1000$?! I think it was unfair of her to even ask for it. No matter your financial situation.", "\"Hrm, do I give up coffee for 12 years or do I spend 5 hours in this dress?\"\n\nNTA.
