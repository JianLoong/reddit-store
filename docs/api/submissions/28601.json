{"id": 28601, "submission_id": "1749v9j", "title": "AITA for telling my sister about my partners plastic surgery?", "selftext": "My gf and I moved to Europe a few years ago, and she ended up getting a lot of plastic surgery while we were out there that I begged her not to get. She got a blepharoplasty, a nose job, fillers, a chin surgery, and I don\u2019t even know what else.\n\nI hate to say it, but it decreased her attractiveness. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s still beautiful, but not nearly as gorgeous as what she use to look like. It also just makes me sad that she removed all the features that I loved on her face. It\u2019s also sad that people think these are features they need to remove. She looks hallowed out and tired.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to admit she got plastic surgery. We\u2019re back home from Europe, and people started commenting on her looks at dinner. One of her friends just straight out asked if she got something done and she said no. She said it was just aging, of course she was going to look different, she\u2019s 27, etc.\n\nI was shocked. I couldn\u2019t even believe she could play that card when the results are so dramatic. It\u2019s so obvious that she was lying, but no one called her out on it.\n\nMy sister has been staying at my parents house because I\u2019m here and she has been weirdly obsessed with her looks since that dinner. She is only 24, and she is truly a baby. 24 seems so young now, or at least, she makes it seem very young.\n\nShe admitted to me that seeing my gf brought up feelings of anxiety towards aging, she said she didn\u2019t know people could change so much and it was stressing her out. She started calling me and freaking out about a line she found on her forehead, which was hardly noticeable at all.\n\nShe isn\u2019t a person that is super fixated on her looks, normally at least, so it surprised me. But she was buying a lot of anti-aging skin care and applying it multiple times a day. I told her she was fine, all she had to do was moisturize and wear sunscreen, I mean, I look the same as I did at 24 but she wasn\u2019t buying it and it was obvious why.\n\nIt hurt me so much to see her like that. She kept putting retinal on her face and would ask me daily if I see \u201clines\u201d going away when there were no lines in the first place. After a while of her spiraling one day I finally broke down and said, \u201cDude, you\u2019re freaking out about aging because of my gf. Chill out. She got plastic surgery, you don\u2019t just randomly start to have totally different features after you hit 25. You are gonna look exactly how you look now at 27, relax.\u201d She is way too young to be hyperfixating on her looks and worrying about aging. She has an obsessive personality sometimes, and gets fixated on things (probably the anxiety disorder), so just telling her that made her drop the subject. Thank god.\n\nI told her weeks ago, but last week my gf asked if I told anyone about her plastic surgery. I admitted I did tell my sister because I didn\u2019t want to lie about it and she is very mad at me. Was I wrong to tell her? My gf didn\u2019t outright say not to tell people, but it was obvious she wanted me to lie for her and expected me to do that.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses. At the end of the day, my sisters well-being and mental health matters to me more than anything or anyone. She is naive, maybe more than you would expect from a 24 year old and I feel I need to protect her. When I told her my gf lied and had plastic surgery she said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think she would lie to me about that.\u201d She looks up to my gf and me a lot. My sister and my girlfriend are both in therapy, and have been more years actually, but that doesn\u2019t really stop insecurities.\n\nEdit: As for an update on our relationship, I do need to talk to her about the future. I\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve lost a lot of respect for her, not because of the plastic surgery and changing her appearance, I had accepted that, but she was fine with lying to my sister and watching her spiral into obsession. I kept bringing it up to her that my sister was struggling and she would deflect and say a lot of young women care about their looks and she\u2019ll get over it. It really rubbed me the wrong way. My sister is my best friend, and my only real family. I\u2019d like to think a partner would see how important she is to me and prioritize her mental well-being. But yes, we will talk about it. Thank you all for your responses and input.\n\nEdit again: This happened a week ago (the argument with my gf), so she did not break up with me. But we still need to talk about the future. I felt it was important to add that my sister didn\u2019t tell anyone about the plastic surgery and she never would, she has kept far worse secrets of mine. My gf is self-conscious of someone finding out, so she\u2019d ask me every once in awhile if I told anyone. That\u2019s how this came up, my sister isn\u2019t going around gossiping about her appearance.", "created_utc": 1696903801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1749v9j/aita_for_telling_my_sister_about_my_partners/", "score": 5326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You see this with older people hiding their age too. It\u2019s not great lying but knowing it\u2019s upsetting to her and telling someone else about her deep seated insecurities without letting her know is AH behavior imho.

What if she had a terrible accident and was permanently disfigured? Would you break up with her? Typically when you truly love someone, their physical appearance doesn\u2019t matter.", "Soft ESH. Including the population of the world. \n\nMy immediate thought is that your sister has had a breakup that involved the partner hooking up with a younger woman. Or she discovered that they are viewing porn that features women who look younger than they (hopefully) are. The fact that your girlfriend obviously has deep concerns about aging could have added to your sister\u2019s fears that being lovely isn\u2019t enough to keep a partner- that one has to actively fight aging all the time in order to maintain the partnership going forward. \n\nI\u2019m dating myself here, but Britney Spears basically broke my world with the video for \u2018Baby One More Time\u2019. It is *understandable* that a beautiful woman of 27 could look at a beautiful girl of 17 and be anxious. There is a LOT of\u2026 uh\u2026 interesting\u2026 online content geared toward \u201cgirls over 22 have hit the wall\u201d and so on. Fear of aging is pretty typical, and these strident male voices don\u2019t help. Neither do the soothing female voices that assure everyone that Product X will keep you young and perfect. \n\nI\u2019d tell you to watch Death Becomes Her with your sister for a legit fun evening, but it might devolve into a snarkfest about the girlfriend. Sigh. It\u2019s a great movie. \n\nBut you asked AITAH. I think you are, because protecting your partner involves keeping their secrets. Another option might have been to discuss your concerns with your girlfriend and ask **her** to check in with your sister. It might  have opened a direct line of communication and potentially allowed your girlfriend to explain why she chose to have surgery. She doesn\u2019t need to **justify** her decision, but hearing about it might be educational for your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister isn\u2019t a 13 year old- she\u2019s a grown-ass woman. furthermore this wasn\u2019t your information to disclose; if your sister is a woman in society, there\u2019s already under immense pressure to be ageless and she will simply need to deal with it. \n\ngf gets a slight asshole vote from me, but not much. people alter their appearances because it makes them feel better, and if she wants to be private about her procedures that is her choice! as everyone else here has said, if she\u2019s had soooo much work done, her lies are easily seen through and your sister could\u2019ve just figured that out with her own brain. \n\nit\u2019s wonderful that your sister is your bff, but that still gave you absolutely no right to share information you were specifically asked not to share.", "Frankenstein's monster will get over it or she won't.  No reason your baby sister needs to fear one year she's going to turn into a ghoul from aging.  NTA.", "I think I would break up with my partner if they got PS, it made them look worse to me, and then they fucking lie about it.\n\nWould totally clean house and embarrass them in front of their friends if they wanna lie like that.", "Nta people have to be honest about plastic surgery or they\u2019ll spread false information and false body standard that could drastic affects on how young impressionable people view themselves", "Not the asshole", "Why the hell would you get plastic surgery done at 27\u2026. Bless her soul when she\u2019s 50 and looks like a bloated Barbie doll\u2026", "INFO\n\n> My sister is my best friend, and my only real family. \n\nWhat about your parents?\n\n> My sister has been staying at my parents house because I\u2019m here\n\nThey're still alive, right? They're not real family?", "NTA but why are you still with this shallow liar who you aren't even attracted to ?", "GF hated the results of the excessive surgeries so much that she can't admit she had them. Damn. NTA", "right\u2026 i hate to be that person but if one woman\u2019s face makes you *that* obsessively insecure then that\u2019s a you problem that you need to work on. lying about plastic surgery is weird and wrong and she shouldn\u2019t have done that, but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s fault that OP\u2019s sister has extreme insecurity issues", "The gf isn't responsible for the sister's anxiety, but she is responsible for the LIES and MISINFORMATION she is telling people.", "I figure if I'm cheering on a trans person who got top surgery or liking a tattoo selfie there's no reason we shouldn't react the same way to other ways people customize their body.", "Lol yeah, like legit all her friends have aged with her during that time, none of them have faces that changed so drastically. Medical tourism is a known thing too, plastic surgery is becoming talked about, more accessible and destigmatised to an extent. Like bro they can tell. They\u2019re just too polite to push because clearly the GF isn\u2019t ready to confess.", "How so? People are not entitled to know her life... No one, except maybe her bf and family  should have the NERVE to ask if she got work done and if they did and got lied to...how does that affect their life? Are they gonna be a bit INSECURE??? OBSESSIVE?? This is not Kylie Jenner doing fillers and selling lipsticks saying \"yep this makeup will give you this lips\", it's just a normal average woman living her life that when asked if she got plastic surgery stated that \"nah my features just changed because I'm over 25\" because guess what? It was none of op's family and especially sister business unless they paid for it ... which Op never stated they did btw"]}
