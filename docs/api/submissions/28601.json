She got a blepharoplasty, a nose job, fillers, a chin surgery, and I don\u2019t even know what else. \n\nI hate to say it, but it decreased her attractiveness. Don\u2019t get me wrong she\u2019s still beautiful, but not nearly as gorgeous as what she use to look like. It also just makes me sad that she removed all the features that I loved on her face. It\u2019s sad that people think these are features they need to remove. She looks hallowed out and tired.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to admit she got plastic surgery. We\u2019re back home from Europe, and we\u2019ve been gone for a few years, and people started commenting on her looks at dinner. One of her friends just straight out asked if she got something done, and she said no. She said it was just aging, of course she was going to look different, she\u2019s 27.\n\nI was shocked. I couldn\u2019t even believe she could play that card when the results are so dramatic. It\u2019s so obvious that she was lying, but no one called her out on it.\n\nMy sister has been staying at my parents house because I\u2019m here and she has been weirdly obsessed with her looks. She is only 24, and she is truly a baby. 24 seems so young now or at least she makes it seem so young.\n\nShe admitted to me that seeing my gf brought up feelings of anxiety towards aging, she said she didn\u2019t know people could change so much and it was stressing her out. She started calling me and freaking out about a line she found on her forehead, which was hardly noticeable at all.\n\nShe isn\u2019t a person that is super fixated with her looks, so it surprised me. But she was buying a lot of anti-aging skin care. I told her she was fine, all she had to do was moisturize and wear sunscreen, I mean, I look the same as I did at 24 but she wasn\u2019t buying it and it was obvious why.\n\nIt hurt me so much to see her like that. She kept putting retinal on her face and would ask me daily if I see \u201clines\u201d going away when there were no lines in the first place. One day I finally broke down and said, \u201cDude, you\u2019re freaking out about aging because of my gf. Chill out. She got plastic surgery, you don\u2019t just randomly start to have totally different features after you hit 25. You are gonna look exactly how you look now at 27, relax.\u201d She is so young to be hyperfixating on her looks and worrying about aging. She has an obsessive personality sometimes, and gets fixated on things, so just telling her that made her drop the subject. Thank god.\n\nI told her weeks ago, but last week my gf asked if I told anyone about her plastic surgery. I admitted I did tell my sister because I didn\u2019t want to lie about it and she is very, very mad at me. Was I wrong to tell her? My gf didn\u2019t outright say not to tell people, but it was obvious she wanted me to lie for her and expected me to do that.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses. At the end of the day, my sisters well-being and mental health matters to me more than anything. She is naive, maybe more than you would expect from a 24 year old and I feel I need to protect her. When I told her my gf lied and had plastic surgery she said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think she would lie to me about that.\u201d She looks up to my gf and me a lot. She and my girlfriend are both in therapy, and have been more years actually, but that doesn\u2019t really stop insecurities.", "created_utc": 1696903801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1749v9j/aita_for_telling_my_sister_about_my_partners/", "score": 770, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You see this with older people hiding their age too.

So many models and actresses get procedures done but do not want to disclose.

There are people who get elective surgery done for genuine reasons like correcting a deviated septum or removing stretch marks after pregnancy. Then there are people who are very insecure with themselves are try to turn themselves in to a Barbie/Ken doll in the hopes of having a better opinion of themself or have others give them compliments. \n\nThe part that confuses me is the fact that she clearly did enough to herself to warrant comments from others but she refuses to admit to the surgery. OP, you are not the a**hole in this situation but I think you need to look at the bigger picture and figure out why your GF felt she needed this surgery but in the same breathe refuses to admit she had one done.", "NTA for your gf lying about it. It\u2019s almost always very obvious if someone has had work done, unless it was done well and so minor that it is barely noticeable. \n\nYTA for basically saying that you are only attracted to her due to her looks. What if she had a terrible accident and was permanently disfigured? Would you break up with her? Typically when you truly love someone, their physical appearance doesn\u2019t matter.", "Soft ESH. Including the population of the world. \n\nMy immediate thought is that your sister has had a breakup that involved the partner hooking up with a younger woman. Or she discovered that they are viewing porn that features women who look younger than they (hopefully) are. The fact that your girlfriend obviously has deep concerns about aging could have added to your sister\u2019s fears that being lovely isn\u2019t enough to keep a partner- that one has to actively fight aging all the time in order to maintain the partnership going forward. \n\nI\u2019m dating myself here, but Britney Spears basically broke my world with the video for \u2018Baby One More Time\u2019. It is *understandable* that a beautiful woman of 27 could look at a beautiful girl of 17 and be anxious. There is a LOT of\u2026 uh\u2026 interesting\u2026 online content geared toward \u201cgirls over 22 have hit the wall\u201d and so on. Fear of aging is pretty typical, and these strident male voices don\u2019t help. Neither do the soothing female voices that assure everyone that Product X will keep you young and perfect. \n\nI\u2019d tell you to watch Death Becomes Her with your sister for a legit fun evening, but it might devolve into a snarkfest about the girlfriend. Sigh. It\u2019s a great movie. \n\nBut you asked AITAH. I think you are, because protecting your partner involves keeping their secrets. Another option might have been to discuss your concerns with your girlfriend and ask **her** to check in with your sister. It might  have opened a direct line of communication and potentially allowed your girlfriend to explain why she chose to have surgery. She doesn\u2019t need to **justify** her decision, but hearing about it might be educational for your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
