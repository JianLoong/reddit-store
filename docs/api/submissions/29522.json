Also your charger won't break from that but i think you know this now from all the other comments.", "NTA.  It's yours, you can keep it to yourself if you want.\n\nThat said, his phone affecting your charger is not a thing.  Him using the cable will contribute to wearing it out eventually, but if that does eventually happen you can just replace the cable, not the entire thing.\n\nHelp him pick out a better charger for his phone.  You can easily get a 2m (or even longer) cord for a lot less than you'd get it from the Apple Website where they charge through the nose.  You could even pay for it if you're nice or if he won't get it and keeps annoying you about your charger.", "I assume you mean a USB-C charger, since Macs don't use Lightning to charge.\n\nI would tell him the truth: he's overcharging his phone and probably wrecking the battery. If he wants to charge more quickly, he should look up his phone specs and see what fast charging it's compatible with and get that. The charger for your Mac is not good for his phone.", "NTA.\n\nThis was a short story and could have been even shorter. That's not a complaint; it's just me pointing out that you don't need justification for not letting someone use your things.\n\nThe problematic individual in this story is your boyfriend. He doesn't respect your rules for your own property. And he actually thinks you're in the wrong for not letting him use your things, since he's giving you dirty looks for not giving him the opportunity to use something you already told him he couldn't.\n\nIn your place, I might have added, \"I already said you can't use it, and I meant what I said.\"\n\nSounds like this is an issue that needs addressing. He doesn't respect your boundaries, and gets mad when you enforce them. This doesn't bode well. This is a larger issue that you need to address with him.\n\nAnd if I paid that much for a charger, I wouldn't let anyone else use it, either. The chargers I've had are notoriously fragile. If someone's not careful, it will eventually break again from less than the most delicate handling. Consequently, I would want this charger to last for as long as it can, and I wouldn't let anyone else handle it except me.", "NTA - I might disagree with you about his plugging the phone into the charger.

If he was rough with it or you were worried about bending/fraying it, I'd understand. But simply using it to charge his phone will not damage the charger. I think your fear is not really founded on any real evidence.\n\nYou are living together, and part of that means that you share your stuff. That's one of the great things about being in a partnership! If he has some great item that benefits you both, you will likely get to use it too! It's a win-win. Imagine he brought a nice coffee maker into the relationship and then wouldn't let you use it because he's afraid you'll damage it, despite there being no history of you misusing coffee machines. That would just be weird. Sure, you're technically entitled to \"set your boundary\". But inability to share even a small thing like a charger with the person that you love is not a great look.

Or it will work for a short time, then stop working.\n\nConsequently, if I paid an exorbitant fee for my charger (to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again), I would make certain that no one uses it, but me.\n\nAnd the bigger issue, for me, is that it doesn't matter what the reason is. The fact is, he was told no. I might think someone is being stupid for not letting me use something of theirs. However, that's not my right to go behind their back and use their things when I've already been told no. The fact is, he doesn't respect her right to have the last word over her own property. He thinks he has the right to not take her boundaries seriously and is free to ignore them.\n\nWhat makes this even worse is that he's not even trying to go behind her back and be sneaky about it.
