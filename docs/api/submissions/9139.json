I know you say you don\u2019t want them to fight, which to me says your brother would be upset at her unilaterally disinviting your fianc\u00e9e, which is all the more reason he NEEDS TO KNOW.", "NTA- If it were me, I wouldnt attend- Hope your situation works out", "Man I dunno, I feel like that's quite an unfair statement to make with the limited information we've been given. Bridezilla could indeed be a very excellent ride. Or, she can be average and be a merely serviceable ride. I'd want to know a few more things before I can comfortably make a judgement. Things like her general athleticism, her core strength, her quad strength, her work ethic, and her general starfish-ness.\n\nOh wait, you mean he's in for a rough marriage. Oh whoopsie. Ignore everything I've said.", "I would let her and your brother know here and now that if your fiance isn't invited to their wedding they're not invited to yours.  NTA", "At your wedding, invite your brother but tell him SIL is not invited because she's a stranger.", "> IMHO you should have a serious talk 1:1 with your brother and ask him if this is the way he wants the rest of your lives to go\n\nYou should speak privately with your brother. It wouldn't surprise me if he didn't even know that his fiancee is trying to exclude your fiance <- (I can never remember how many \"e\"'s to use)", "If you tell him about this gently, it could start a fight between them, but if you don\u2019t tell him why you\u2019re not showing up for the wedding and he finds out later it\u2019s could be a major fight between the two of you. He will feel like you didn\u2019t trust him or give him the choice of having you at his wedding.\n\nI mean you\u2019re not planning on just not showing up without an explanation are you?", "So would you be happy if the shoe was on the other foot i.e. your partner did something like this and your brother decided to keep it from you?\n\nPlease don't say \"my partner would never\".", "He needs to know, especially if he gets along with your fiance and will miss her at the wedding.", "Yeah no, it's not your responsibility whether they fight or not!", "NTA", "Omg those women were awful! I always got sucked into that show back in the day, idk how anyone talked to those women after the weddings.", "And it. Was. AWESOME.", "Just make sure none of the people you're inviting have any actual outstanding warrants or legal issues.", "Idk how those women got married.", "SHE is the bride, the attention will be on HER and her husband because it's THEIR wedding. Besides it's not like everyone needs to stare at just the bride and groom all day without interacting with one another.\n\nSil is just a crazy, entitled brat.", "Also keep in mind that other family numbers (mom and aunts) already know what's happening. \n\nSo he will find out at some point.  And it will be best for everyone involved if he hears from you first (instead of some other family member).", "Your response reminds me of the \"I'm so nice I have to get along with everyone.\" Which is not actually nice-ness, but just chronic conflict avoidance. It's actually genuinely healthier to let your bro know what's happening not trying to gloss over and make a fake peace move.", "This isn't difficult. Talk to him. You think just not showing up at his wedding is the easier approach!??", "OP. I understand where your sister is coming from. No AH here. It is her wedding. It is how she wants it. It's her day. Support your brother. Support SIL. It's not as big a deal as you are making it. You are making it an issue. Your soon to be wife understands. Take one for the team. It's only 1 day.\n\nAlso. I HAVE BEEN TO A WEDDING LIKE THAT!!! Famous person did ruin it for Bride!! People just mobbed famous person. It was hard to be in attendance.", "I am going to be the outlier but NAH. I completely get where SIL is coming from. If your fiancee is famous, routinely gets recognized and, whether intentionally or not, diverts attention to herself simply by being present, it would be understandable for a bride to not want her attention stolen on her day. Whether the theft is intentional or not doesn't matter the fact would remain that on one of the most important and precious days of her life thebspotlight was stolen and she wound up in the shadows. \n\nAnyway is your brother or future SIL close to your fiancee? Doe they have anything beyond a superficial \"they're dating a family member\" relationship? \n\nI get not wanting your fiancee to be excluded but she's not an AH for requesting the mitigation of a situation in which she is likely to be pushed aside on a day that is supposed to be about her and her fiance.", "NTA but there something else you could try before just not going. Try and ask how she\u2019d feel if you went alone as per her request but then in return you excluded her of your wedding. If she then comes up with a \u201cthis is my day\u201d stuff you can tell her that you\u2019ve already asked this woman to spend the rest of her life with you and you\u2019re not planning on turning your back on her for the sake of one day. And whatever answer you get is the answer to everything. ;)", "NTA, and somebody should make a Bridezilla movie in the grand tradition of the old Godzilla movies, only instead of Godzilla stomping around Tokyo destroying stuff, it\u2019s Bridezilla.", "NTA of course because wtf? Good to read you gave them an ultimantum back. What a harsh way of her dealing with her insecurities. She forgot that you guys will have a relationship (or not) beyond that wedding.", "NTA. She\u2019s going to be your wife - she\u2019s not some stranger you picked up off the street just to have a date for the wedding. (Although FSIL might prefer that.)\n\nOP, somewhere around is a post called \u201cDon\u2019t Rock the Boat\u201c. It discusses exactly what\u2019s going on here. You should read it. I don\u2019t have a link, but I\u2019m sure someone on here does.", "I'm sorry, I find that accusation of prioritizing \"a stranger over family\" to be *hugely* insulting. NTA", "NTA. Next she\u2019ll also be banning anyone who\u2019s prettier than she is or with a better figure or better hair.", "NTA. And what does your SIL expect to happen for any other events? That your SO stay home whenever there's a family event for the rest of your lives?", "The petty part of my brain says \u201ci know who\u2019s not invited to your wedding\u201d", "NTA. I'm so frustrated hearing people say 'compromise to keep the peace'. No. Don't compromise. SIL can exclude your fiance but she and family dont get to guilt you into going. Do what your heart and gut tell you is the right thing to do. You could offer to arrive just before the nuptials start and sit in the back so as to not disturb the ceremony. If that isn't good enough, well, do what is right for you and your fiance. I wish you all the best and congratulations on your upcoming wedding.", "She broke the peace, talk to your brother and tell him that you\u2019re not going because of his wife\u2019s to be behaviour.\nGo and do something nice on the day just the two of you and switch your phone off.\nMake it very clear that the reason you\u2019re not attending is because the Bride is worried about her spotlight being stolen.", "NTA", ">She got upset and accused me of prioritizing a stranger over family.\n\nNTA. Holy crap. By her standards, the soon-to-be SIL is also a stranger.", "NTA I attended a family wedding last year that included a nationaly recognizable celeb, friend of the grooms. No one cared, it was the bride and grooms day. OK later in the evening an older lady who had a little to much to drink became a little hands with him, but he was so drunk himself he didn't care.", "If you go or not, please left her out of your wedding!\n\nNTA", "NTA, the brides jealousy is showing\u2026.", "NTA, and thanks for prioritizing your fiancee. The bridezilla is being majorly stupid here.", "It\u2019s not your job to keep them from fighting. I would want my sibling to have my back and not keep the truth from me. He\u2019s big enough to make his own decisions based on facts. It\u2019s worse for him (and for you) if you withhold pertinent information from him. I love that you\u2019re standing by your fianc\u00e9. NTA.", "So it's bridezilla going to also exclude your fiancee from other family gatherings like.... Her first child's first birthday party because \"it should be about child, not this famous person.\" There's too much insecurity here to be acceptable. I feel bad for your fiancee too since she seems like she's just trying to be normal and distance herself from all that comes with being famous.\n \n \nNTA", "I don\u2019t get it, she doesn\u2019t want a famous person to come to her wedding!? Ha! So much for entertaining people. What a complete and total bore she is. I feel sorry for her guests. It\u2019s gonna be a sleeper.\n\nNTA", "My friend's best man is famous. He's an actor most people in the UK would know and at the time of the wedding was starring in a huge show that has a pretty big international distribution. He didn't upstage the bridge or the groom. They were the centre of attention. The groom and him got up on stage later and sang acoustic covers, it was hilarious and yet still the centre of attention was the bride and groom. Amazingly, not one of us forgot we were at a wedding and who was getting married. But it was made a bit more memorable by having a famous actor singing Britney Spears' Toxic at a wonderful wedding. \n\nIf instead of being small and insecure, you are generous with your heart, your friends' successes lift you up and reflect on you and you do the same for them.", "*\"Not a peaceful act.\"* \n\nYou're right son, ***it's a declaration of War!***\n\nJk jk, but NTA OP", "Well done, I like the cut of your jib.", "I feel like people downvoted you without reading the whole comment but I could be wrong", "That's such a brilliant idea.", "LOL. I like this friend", "Compromise could be both of you coming in a little while into the reception party", "OP,  you're being a coward. There's going to be a fight, now or later. If not now, when will SIL accept your wife? You know your brother better than we do--how is he going to feel being blindsided by this? \n\nYour fiancee is being very sweet about it, but really---do you want this issue settled by her sad acceptance? If you were my fiancee I'm not sure I'd ever forget that you hid out from resolving this.", "No. They should fight over this. Walking on eggshells before a wedding does not make for a good marriage. \nBest play is for you to tell your brother firmly that you won't be there without her. And he can chat to his fiance about the request. And gets to decide which is more important. \n\nSet your boundaries. \n\nShe is being completely ridiculous. Your brother deserves to know that.", "Same here, it would be so much simpler if the word betrothed was still being used, same word with same spelling for all genders.", "\ud83d\udc95 it!", "Yes they were and me too!! It was like a car wreck - you couldn\u2019t look away!!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Ohhhh, just wonderful!", "You know what to do but you don't want to. The problem will only get worse if you hide from it.", "Right? Wonder if any of them still are", "I know! They were smart to do half the stories on each episode so you HAD to keep watching. They had a marriage bootcamp show too, I think they did a bridezilla episode", "Its got to be on freestv or one of those apps. I found the surreal life and rock of love awhile back.", "Was that the one with Brett micheals? I can't watch that, I don't like that guy. He just feels like a skeevy dude to me, idk lol.  I did like the surreal life though that show was fun haha"]}
