Explain to the whole family that you support your brother, but her decision to refuse to allow your fiancee to attend because she's afraid that people may not be entirely focused on her the entire time, means that you are unable to be there to celebrate the marriage. Let them know that you think it sucks to be forced to make such a decision, but that if she's so concerned about what people will be focusing on, that your presence without your girlfriend there's also the chance that your presence without her may raise questions that would distract from her day, because you will answer the questions truthfully. Point out that of course your absence may also raise questions that may distract from the attention being focused solely on her, but that you're unable to stop anyone from asking those questions, and will answer any directed your way over the coming decades, truthfully.\n\nI'm betting that the risk of tarnishing her image will either result in a proper invitation, or her refusal to ever interact with you again, so it's a win either way.", "NTA but you need to tell bridzilla that you not showing up at the wedding (and you should not attend without your fianc\u00e9) is going to cause people to ask why and the truth isn't going to make her look good on her \"special day\".", "NTA.

If it was me, I'd be stoked to have a famous singer in my wedding. Might even ask them to sing a couple of songs.", "NTA. 3 years in stay home. Yes, it's her day. But it's your SO that's who you stand with. Future SIL needs to get over it. The bride trumps all in attendance. It's her day even if she wears a burlap bag.

I can just a little sympathize with the bride, who very well might be overshadowed on her special day.

He needs to know before the wedding.  Her actions to you might just be the tip of the iceberg of AH behavior.", "He should know regardless. You're not protecting anyone by withholding that information. Doing that just says you don't trust your brother with the truth. He deserves the truth, no?", "I get that.

You just need to talk to him?!?\n\n\u201cBrother, I have to talk to you about something that\u2019s serious and stressful for me.

I\u2019m not comfortable leaving her home - after all, she\u2019s soon to become my wife - but I wanted to let you know about the situation.\u201d\n\nIf this causes strife between him and his fianc\u00e9e that\u2019s not on you? They have to be able to work through conflict in order to have a successful relationship. (As do you.)", "It's not a you problem, it's a them problem. They are the ones who need to solve it i.e. your brother needs/deserves to know asap", "Call him and say \u201chey, just wanted to wish you and STB-Wife all the best. Let\u2019s get together after the wedding or something. Hope you enjoy your special day.\u201d And when he asks you wtf you\u2019re talking about, just casually say \u201cwell your fianc\u00e9 disinvited us from your wedding because she didn\u2019t want to be upstaged by my fianc\u00e9e and of course we wouldn\u2019t want to do anything to ruin your big day, so we won\u2019t be there.\u201d See how he reacts. Chances are he has no idea and it\u2019ll take care of itself from there.  \n\nObviously NTA and any strife between them that results from you telling him is 100% her fault and not remotely yours.", "I don't think you can make any decision until you've discussed it with your brother"]}
