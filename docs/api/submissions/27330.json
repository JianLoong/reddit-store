My wife (26f) also moved jobs and increased her pay (from $40,000 to $50,000.) We recently welcomed our third child into our home, and our daycare expenses rose to $1000 a month, which ends up being a little less than half of my wife's take-home pay. Also for context we share finances completely, so when I say \"my pay\" or \"her paycheck\" to us it is really just our money.\n\nMy wife told me that she would like to stay home with the children following this school year (she works as a teacher). I told her we could try to make it work and we started budgeting to live on only my income without her check. We still pay daycare with her check, but that is all. The rest of her check we pay extra on our debt ($40,000 in consumer debt, 110,000 mortgage debt). The last month we have been able to do this, but it is much tighter financially than we would like to have it. If you notice, our incomes combined a couple years ago totaled $75,000, which is close to my income alone now. So we are essentially living on our old incomes, but with 3 children to care for and with significant inflation.\n\nI am sad that we are struggling so much with this new budget. I want to tell my wife that I'd like her to continue to work so that we can have an easier life with more margin. I am worried, however, that it would be an asshole move to tell her to keep working when I know she is a great mother and is really struggling with wanting to stay home with them. The only other option we have as far as money is to reduce our retirement contributions to give us more margin (I contribute 8% pre-tax, employer matches 8%, then I do an additional 8% in Roth). I don't want to reduce these contributions because I want us to be able to retire comfortably.\n\nWIBTA if I told my wife that I am not comfortable with our budget on only my income, and that I would like her to continue working to give us more financial margin in our lives?", "created_utc": 1695311279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ojc8r/wibta_if_i_told_my_wife_we_do_not_make_enough/", "score": 2930, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't you compromise and help her find a part-time position or something that allows her to be home more and present with the kids? They're only small for so long, and if you mostly use her check for daycare, it seems like you could get by with her bringing home a smaller amount of money.\n\nEDIT: For those saying NTA and saying the wife is wrong, OP never says they can't afford to live off his income. He just doesn't want to, he wants a better margin for himself. \n\nThe kids are only young once, I don't see why it's wrong for the wife to want to be a SAHM while they're young. She can return to work when they're older. Also, she was technically the primary breadwinner while OP was finishing his PhD. Why was it possible for him to crunch the numbers back then for his benefit, but he isn't willing to budge at all now for his wife's benefit? It seems like an easy solution is having her be a SAHM with a part time of her choice.", "I totally get where you are coming from and I think people have some good points.\n\nI think part of the answer is that you need to do this for more than 1 month. The two of you need a discussion of let's try this for X period where all of wife's income goes to childcare and debt and yours going to cost of living, and each month you both go over what has that looked like. Are there things you can save on or cut? Are there things you can't? \n\nBut essentially take 3 months- 6 months, whatever- and give both of you a sense of what with the current economy it would really be like for the 5 of you to live on just your income. (Obviously part of this discussion needs to include how long is your wife thinking she wants to be a SAHM for. Would she consider picking up a part time job like tutoring to help supplement the family income if needed. Things like that. There are a lot of things that you guys should take this opportunity to calmly discuss.)", "NTA, but y\u2019all are living far above your means. 40k in consumer debt and 11k in mortgage debt is a crazy level of debt to consider quitting a job.

It's possible she could reduce her teaching time to 0.5, for example. \n\nBased on your post, it seems like you all are communicative and reasonable partners, prioritizing one another and family.

Yeah she\u2019s not thinking clearly about your financial situation, you\u2019re not there yet. NTA", "NTA but.... you aren't in dire straits and this are other options. Firstly, your mortgage is fairly small so you could extend the amortization.  Secondly, your retirement savings are high..  a lot of people have to slow that down temporarily when you have kids. While you were doing your phD did your wife support you? She might be feeling it's her turn. I also like the part time option for her mentioned above. As well there is being a SAHM but temporarily.. a few years maybe. Time with the kids is precious and for her she would basically be working to pay for daycare which can be depressing and demotivating. You made the choice to have 3 kids.. was the choice also to have someone else raise them? \n\nThis isn't all black and white and I feel likes it's just the beginning of a conversion for you both", "Is there an in between option.\n\nWhere I live the first 9k is completely tax free and the next 14k is very low tax (not transferable between spouses).\n\nA lot of parents work 2 days a week to take advantage of that and get grandparents to take care of 1 day a week of childcare each.\n\nAlso is she looking to be a sahm going forward or for just a couple of years (in which case you can consider pausing the pension contributions and resume later on).", "NTA. You need money to support your family and if her quitting prevents that, it's not good for anybody. What happens if an unexpected expense comes up? You still need to be able to save. An 8% employer match is unheard of. A free 8% from them that accrued interest is huge for retirement planning. Can she sub part time or something for a while? It's a huge burden on you if things are that tight.", "NTA. \n\nI mean\u2026 it\u2019s all part of the discussion right? You guys will just have to negotiate.", "NTA but look at the numbers together, don't just tell her.

When my 3 were very small, I took a 3 year career break. It was tough financially, but I wouldn't change it for all the money in the world. Kids are only small for a short time, and it was lovely to be able to stay home with them. \nBut I do understand your point, too. It's very uncomfortable to be in a rocky place financially. Could your wife job share for a few years? One day, they will all be in school, and there will be no need to stay home.", "Working mothers can be great mothers too FYI. I think it's going to place unfair burdens on both of you.", "NTA. It would be irresponsible NOT to tell her.", "First of all, if she were to quit mid year there is a chance that the district could pull her credential and she could not have the option to go back into teaching when the kids were older.  So I would go through this school year only paying daycare out of her salary and putting the rest into savings and not touching it except for work expenses for her only.  See how that goes and it can help with the decision.", "Not able to judge TAH here but these kids will all be in school within 5 years so is your wife wanting to go back to work after that? If so, her staying home may work out fine. Otherwise, is there some way she can work part time with her school district? to compensate for the half of her income that doesn't go to childcare?", "Dude are you serious?

Get one or two kids to take care of who are around the same age as yours, it's more work, but not impossible, and it can be decent money.", "Can\u2019t she work from home? Even something part-time? Can she watch other kids alongside yours for extra money?

Plus, when your wife wants to return to the workforce she's going to find it extremely difficult to find anything that provides the pay and hours she currently has. Plus, she's not putting anything into her retirement or social security if she isn't working. Those are very important - you never know what the future holds.", "NTA. You are gonna have to sit down and talk with her. Things will probably have to change if she decides to not go back to work.", "Could their be a compromise?  Is there a part time remote job she could get?  $40k in consumer debt is a LOT.  Or a side hustle for you?  NTA, but your consumer debt will overwhelm you both if you don\u2019t get it knocked down.", "NTA, i mean you guys both had kids, shes aware of the state of the economy and world if she was working, i think that its something she has to accept if she also chose to have kids on that income.

She can earn some money, attend field trips, keep up her skills and a foot in the door.", "NTA, but YTA to both of you for having 3 kids without planning your finances better. So much debt and you brought not one, not two, but THREE extra mouths into this world to feed, and now 5 people could be potentially less happy.\n\nBut since that is done, both of you need to suck it up and work hard to keep the 3 kids fed and taken care of.

That might be a great way to bring in some extra income and still be able to stay home with the kids.", "I think there is room to compromise.  Maybe she could tutor part-time in the evenings and/ or from home to negate the childcare expense.", "NTA. I make slightly more than both of you combined and only have one child and we\u2019re living on a pretty tight budget with bills, mortgage and significantly increased food and gas prices lately. I cannot imagine living on your wages alone with three children. It\u2019s just not a responsible thing to do. What if your car breaks down? What if you need to repair something in the house? What if you have an unexpected medical bill? How will you save for the kids\u2019 college funds? It\u2019s not fair to the kids to sacrifice their financial stability in order to let your wife live in comfort.", "YWNBTA.\n\nFinances are a collaborative discussion and you won't be an AH if you tell her that you don't see how this makes sense and sit down and look at the numbers. \n\n**But** be open to discussion. If her plan is to do this until your two oldest are in school full time, then maybe its a short term solution for some longer term gain.", "NTA being honest about how you feel.   But is it the reality?  \n\nOnce you significantly pay down any debts with her income You probably can swing it.  You're just nervous about it which is totally understandable. \nIf you have high interest debts you should be paying off those first. I'm going to assume your mortgage is lower interest than anything else. So you should not be paying on your mortgage. But that other 40,000 in what you refer to as consumer debt, I assume is credit cards at 28% interest rate. Good God you should not have gotten into that mess in the first place. When you're done with all this you need to put those credit cards somewhere and not use them anymore - unacceptable.  Credit cards are a convenience They are not alone. You should never carry your credit card balance for month to month\n\nIn fact if you are carrying a credit card balance month-to-month at a high interest rate, I would encourage you to use any home equity to pay off the credit cards. That alone will get rid of $40,000 debt and reduced interest rate substantially. Then you can continue to pay off on the mortgage line of credit first at the lower rate.\n\nFYI there's a personal finance Reddit. You might want to join and get some information on paying off that consumer debt\n\n      Anyway to continue on a topic...\n Once she stays home, you will have other expenses that will drop considerably not just daycare.  Consider any other expenses that are incurred because of her job.  Gasoline for example. If she's traveling a long distance for work there's wear and tear on the car, maintenance upkeep that will no longer be as much of an issue, especially if the one kid is traveling by bus to school.  If she's putting less miles on the car you may be eligible for reduced insurance on the car because now it's considered a pleasure vehicle instead of a necessary commuter.  Clothing expenses will be reduced. Food expenses will be reduced.  Consider how often you may be buying convenience foods for yourselves and the kids because neither of you have time to cook every single meal, make lunches make breakfast because you both work full time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is a normal way to have a mature relationship.\n\nI can see it from both of your perspectives. If I were in both of your shoes, I would say she should stay home to raise the kids, but work part-time. She could tutor online (or in person after school) or offer daycare for another child of a similar age to your kids. \n\nI think having a parent stay at home is really good for the children. Also, once they are in school, she could go back to teaching and have a really similar schedule to their school hours, so that will minimize your daycare costs. Hopefully your salary will continue to grow and it won\u2019t be a struggle. \n\nI do worry about your wife\u2019s mental health.

You're allowed an opinion on your family's financial future.\n\nA couple thoughts that I hope are helpful:\n\n* Consider reducing your retirement contribution. Keep working towards a higher income, you still have time to raise that contribution higher in the future.\n* There are remote-work jobs for teachers, including teaching online college courses or even virtual high school courses. Teaching one or two courses will likely be a lighter workload than her current job, allowing her to spend most of her time being a mom, while providing some supplemental income. Especially if you are able to make some dinners and tend to the kids in the evenings so she can have that time to work.\n* Do you and your wife have a similar mindset about how to handle the debt? $40k consumer debt is fairly high. If I were you I'd put every dime towards that until it's gone -- it is likely negating your retirement savings if you do the math. I'd do some extra research around debt and financial planning and see if that helps settle the issue.
