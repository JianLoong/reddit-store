And why are the parents not correcting the little jerk?", "NTA Sounds like he was digging at his brother trying to get a rise and cause the attention to go to him(Little one), or for people just to fight. He was being a jerk, and being fifteen he is not a 'kid'.", "NTA. He's 15. He knew that by saying that crack to your fiance, that he was starting shit! If he's gonna dish it out, he should be able to take it!", "What are my thoughts - LOL!!!! Perfect way to get him to STFU and leave you be.\n\nNTA - you are alright :)", "NTA. A 15 year old knows exactly what he meant when he said that. I see from comments that sweet brother is the Golden Child. Good on yah for standing up, more people need to do this.", "ROFLMAO.  You probably should not have, but I would hope that I would think as quickly in the same situation.  15 is old enough to know better that to be a little shyte.  NTA", "NTA He's old enough to learn.", "NTA- brother is. This is a 16 year old he knows what he says and he is purposefully hurtful to his brother. It is past time for your fiance to come up with some witty comebacks to shut him up. For example- when he brings up the adoption you could say- its great Mom and Dad Chose him for a son since they got stuck with the brother. As for the racist remarks, it really depends on what he is saying but one course of action would be to catch him in the act and record a video of him, keep it safe and tell him you will out him to others if he keeps it up. (You don't have to actual do this its just the threat of it) Unless his friends and others around him are also racist he won't want that to get out and even if they are any job prospects and colleges would be, again you don't have to actually put it out its the threat that will make him think twice.", "Ouch NTA just because that was so good.\n\nBut really, at 15 he knew he was being a jerk, and didn't like getting some back.", "ESH \n\nYes, he's being a typical jerk teenager and that sucks.  You should have better strategies for handling him because sinking to his level means you suck too.  Hence ESH.", "Can\u2019t judge this one without knowing how the relationship between you and the little brother is.  If you have no/little relationship with each other then that\u2019s low.  If you\u2019ve dealt with his shit for a long time it\u2019s probably ok.", "ESH but you more so. You both were behaving childishly but, unlike you, he is a child.", "Esh but mostly you here. He was out of pocket but he's a teen without full brain development. You're an adult with way more brain development and went in extremely hard. You escalated majorly.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou're the adult here so you should know the sometimes fighting fire with fire is not the way to go. Did the kid deserve it if he's a big a punk as you say? Well, yeah. But again, you're the grown up and should have set a better example. \n\nBut as a huge passive aggressive, snarky person myself, nice comeback.", "ESH you shouldn't have lowered yourself to his response.", "ESH \u201che started it\u201d isn\u2019t a defense for adults. He was being a bit of a dick, but you were unnecessarily cruel in your response. \n\nI was going to go with YTA because he\u2019s a kid, and you may have misread his tone, but after reading your comments, that kid is a massive AH. Still, two wrongs and all that\n\nI personally don\u2019t believe in \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d. I think it\u2019s more effective to just call out the person\u2019s meanness, especially if there are other people around. That way the focus isn\u2019t on me and what I said, but on how messed up their comment was.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have hit below the belt like that, you should have been smarter and said something like \u201cAw don\u2019t be jealous, I\u2019m sure *someone* will choose you too someday\u2026 fianc\u00e9 was very lucky to be chosen twice\u201d", "ESH but you especially \ud83d\ude2d Why are you 23 and engaged acting like a teenage girl? Just say yeah why would I care and move on. I doubt this is real though because no way a mom would be cool with you saying that to her kid", "YTA", "YTA I agree with your father in law. I would think differently if he were 7-8 years older or even younger. Teens take that stuff too literally if you don't soften it.", "yeah YTA he's 15, you're the adult. be better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
