We left after Christmas2005 & we\u2019ve been here ever since. \n\nGrowing up dad & his family would tell us about how mom had been cheating for months dad found out & that\u2019s y he left it wasn\u2019t so hard to believe since she gave birth 6 m after we left & had a 2nd child 2 yrs later w the same guy who she moved into the house dad built for my siblings & I. \n\nWe were hurt & angry at her for breaking our family in our eyes it was all her fault. She tried to get us back for a month calling dad a thief for taking us from her & bad mouthing his whole family she stopped shortly after & we didn\u2019t hear from her for years. \n\nHer having a new family was like she wanted to replace us. We hated her for it. I used to cry myself to sleep wondering why I wasn\u2019t good enough for her love. It was painful & still is. my older sister got pregnant & married at 18 & left so again I was left alone. I have terrible abandonment issues that I always blamed my mother for, I never forgave her. throughout the years of us being adults she has tried contacting us several times & my mind was always set that I wanted nothing from her until i found out the real reason everything happened. \n\nI found out my dad is gay. & he had been hooking up with my mothers male cousin even after we moved. Mom cheated bc she knew their sex life & marriage had been over for months so she had to move on. My dad lied to us and made it seem like it was all her fault victimizing himself & making her to be the villain. Dad never got remarried or had GF\u2019s all these years & I always thought it was bc he was too busy taking care & providing for his 3 children. He was my hero growing up and I loved him more than anything. But my relationship with him has slowly gotten worse the older I get i\u2019ve seen his true colors. He\u2019s a manipulative narcissistic drunk who lied to us & robbed us from growing up with a our mother.\n\nI see her different now that I know the truth. I even feel sorry for her bc she spent 17 years getting blamed for something that wasn\u2019t her fault & hated by her own children. All the pain we caused her by believing the lies all these years & for her to take it all & still keep my dads secret bc she didn\u2019t want to hurt us. \n\nI found out about this by accident when dad & one of my uncles were arguing & uncles let it out that he was the one who caught him in bed with moms cousin. My aunt shut him up quickly bc she realized that I was there. I was in shock for weeks & never told a single soul what I heard that day. \n\nSo AITA for keeping this secret from my siblings? I feel bad about not telling them right away since they deserve to know the truth in case they want to reconnect w mom before it\u2019s too late. But what if me telling them hurts them more & out of anger they lose another parent?", "created_utc": 1690300934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159cmvh/aita_for_keeping_a_secret_about_the_real_reason/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
