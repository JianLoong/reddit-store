I'm assuming 'redundant' means she is may lose her job. This is a critical reality. If he can't earn money for his needs he's certainly not gonna bail her out. \n\nShe is way lenient and she sees it as helpful but it is not. He has no drive to change his lifestyle.

The rule for my son was always \u201cwork or school\u201d. He had to be doing something. Sadly, your mom is enabling your brother to be a loafer. There is really not much you can do about it. If she gets into a financial bind you would not be obligated to help her out - just keep that in mind.", "You're not an asshole for being concerned for your mother but you can't force her to do what you want either, it's her money and her choice at the end of the day so a very soft YTA for not dropping it maybe?", "NTA, but this is ultimately your mum's choice. My own mother would sell both her kidneys if it were to save any of her children, and would ensure they got an equal share of any inheritance even if they completely disowned her. I've had words with her about this kind of lop-sided relationship, but in the end I tell her it's her choice, and I just put it out of my mind and get back to my own life. Nothing wrong with you voicing your concern, but leave her be if she decides to keep doing what she wants to.", "NAH for the situation you describe.\n\nYour mother may need to hear from someone that continuing to give your brother an allowance will mean that she has less to keep the household running. So it may be a good idea to bring it up.\n\nBut it's her money and she can do what she likes with it.  If she wants to cut off her nose to spite her face... she's allowed to.\n\nThis is nothing something to do a big song and dance about and I'd only get your point across and leave it at that.\n\nYou'll need to set some boundaries and it may be hard to hold them if your mother doesn't find another job quickly.. or your brother doesn't get a job.  They are very quickly likely going to start asking you for money so that's going to be the next difficult thing you will have to deal with.\n\nI wouldn't want them moving in with me... especially if you are in a share house or a one bedroom apartment.  You'll have a real moral quandry then.  I don't envy you.", "NTA, but don't expect her to change her mind. You are her babies and she'd do everything to make you happy and see that you're well taken care off. I know how frustrating this must be for you, because it surely puts a strain on your mum, but there is nothing you can do.", "YWBTA if you tell her to stop giving him money.  \n\nYou can talk with her about your concerns, that he'll never become a self-sufficient adult at this rate and that she's hurting herself giving him money that she can't afford.  You can also tell her that you can't/won't help her out financially if she has problems paying bills because you're allowed to set boundaries for yourself.  You can't dictate how she spends her own money, though.", "Spoken like a capitalist stooge.", "Her mom can choose until the money runs out. As long as they are not going to come to OP when they cannot afford to eat or pay the bills. And if they lose their home as long as they don't come knocking on OP'S door"]}
