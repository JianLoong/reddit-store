I do honestly debate if she has any passion or is in love with me still. \n\nHow much love/passion can a person truly have if they willingly forfeit almost 2 months of every year?\n\nWe have been together since 2010, and have two small children. My wife is from another state, but we live in the Deep South. She works in education so she gets summers off with our children. I work in an office setting now, but I used to work in oil and gas doing rotational work of 2 weeks on 2 weeks off. \n\nSince my wife\u2019s family lives in her home state, she wants to go back for the ENTIRE summer and every winter break. This used to make sense when I worked in oil and gas, because I didn\u2019t want to hold them hostage at our home. \n\nNow that I have been in an office capacity for the last three years, I have started requesting that we change this. The last three summers have been the hardest months of my life. She is unwilling to change. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot in [our state]\u201d \u201cyou have to work\u201d \u201cwe never do anything\u201d. We CANT do anything because she is insistent to be in her home state. \n\nI understand that we created a habit, but I have changed everything about my career to be closer to home and more involved with OUR family, not her birth family, we created our own. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Please be brutally honest. I would love to read the replies because I am literally sitting in our house alone for 6 more weeks (I used almost two weeks of vacation to drive them up there and spend time with them). \n\nI can\u2019t go spend all summer there because I have to work and we can\u2019t afford a dog sitter for the whole summer.\n\n\nEdit to add:\n\nI wish my wife would split the summer between our two states, but it's all or nothing. Her family is in good health and comes to see us a month in March + 2 months during the summer they are there, and 2 weeks in the winter. We spend almost 25% of our time with her family and we live 1500 miles apart. WE DON'T EVEN SEE MY FAMILY THAT MUCH AND THEY LIVE CLOSE, because every time they come she wants the house to be perfect and it's such a miserable/stressful experience I just try and avoid doing anything but eating out at a restaurant. \n\nThis all basically relegates me to school year only. So I'm just the guy that gets to make his kids do homework and go to bed, while my father in law gets all the fun times. I basically set up a franchise for him.\n\nHer family is wealthy and part of a summer community that she grew up in. So she is constantly around other members who she previously had relationships /flings with when she was in HS/College.\n\n\nThese summers have caused the deepest and worst depressions of my life. I just don't think I'll ever understand. Every habit, sound, sensation that I have and hold dear is completely gone for 6 more weeks.", "created_utc": 1688399240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pmo6l/aita_my_wife_and_kids_spend_summers_away_from_our/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some time still makes sense but not the whole thing. It was a good solution under different circumstances but office job hours means lots of time to be at home, the kids are off school and this is probably, in theory, the time of year when you could be spending the most time with them. \n\nIMO you should be taking them on a real family vacation with your time off (or just spending it together) instead of using that time to chauffeur them to their \"real\" vacation. You deserve quality time with your children and your children deserve quality time with their father and as a family unit. \n\n>I have changed everything about my career to be closer to home and more involved with OUR family, not her birth family, we created our own.\n\nI don't think this feeling is at all unreasonable. Just be careful how you go about putting it into action.", "INFO: what are your kids thoughts on the matter? Do they like to spend the summers there or would they prefer to stay in your town? What are they getting to do there that they can\u2019t do with you (ex. Horse riding, fancy summer camp, etc)?\n\nWhat are your living conditions like? If you are living in a tiny appartement while your in-laws have a big house with a yard, it might be better for the kids. \n\nAlso, you said that there is plenty of stuff to do where you live. However, since you are always working, do you expect your wife to run the household and organizing the outings with the kids while you work? If the answer is yes, I can understand why she would prefer to go somewhere where she has family to help around.\n\nLastly, why did you move to the town you currently live in? Did you both move for your job, etc? It seems like your wife misses her a family a lot and she might perceive 2 out of 12 month as a small sacrifice on your part for her since your family live close by.", "It sounds life your wife and kids got into a summer routine they enjoy when you were working 2 weeks on/away from home and 2 weeks home. \n\nWhy don't you start planning some amazing things for next summer and start sending them to your family to start the process of compromising for next summer and life going forward? If your wife's complaint is that you don't plan family activities and that's why she doesn't want to curtail her summer tradition, then address that. If that doesn't help her change her mind then you know other issues are at play and try some deep talking or counseling to get to the root of the problem.\n\nQuestion: do your kids have a good time during their summer travel? If so, you might want to take that into consideration and think about how you can have quality dad time with them when they're home. I would also consider how you communicate with your wife about this as you obviously miss your family but have a bit of a victim mentality in your language which won't help your case with your spouse about the issue.", "NTA,\n\nI get visiting family but\u2026the entire summer and winter breaks. It honestly sounds like your wife has attachment issues if I\u2019m being honest. Since your situation change she should start compromising as well.

How much could you actually do with them if you're doing 9-5 5 days a week? Wouldn't they just be waiting for the times you aren't working/taking care of other things/taking down time for yourself?\n\nThis is only 6 weeks - after your wife has done how many years of you being gone every 2 weeks?\n\n*So she is constantly around other members who she previously had relationships /flings* \n\nThis is sounding more like insecurities than you missing your famliy.", "NAH. \n\nBut I do want to challenge the idea that you can\u2019t be in love with or devoted to someone if you are away from them on a regular basis. My partner travels for business, and although I love them, I also deeply appreciate my time away from my spouse to enjoy my own hobbies and interests. Right now my entire family is on vacation, but I stayed home to work. Yes, it will be nice when they return, but their absence gives me a chance to go on bike rides and hikes during the off-hours, which they probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy the way I do. \n\nMy spouse and I are a team, are working towards the same goals and have a shared life. Being away from each other sometimes doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re no longer on the same team. It just means that we each have individual goals that fit within the framework of our broader relationship.", "NAH I think you should look in to finding a new job and moving back to her home state, or make your peace with the summer escape. As someone who lives in the South it is just so miserably horribly hot I absolutely adore my husband and I\u2019d leave for the whole summer without him even if I didn\u2019t have some idyllic northern summer community ready made. I can see how this sucks for you but I wouldn\u2019t call anyone an asshole for getting out of the south in the summer. Anyone that can does. Most of the husbands I know left behind are happy their children are building such great memories and enjoying their summer. I feel like very few of the NTA have spent a summer in the Deep South taking care of kids.", "NAH. I am \"this\" wife (not OP's wife) I'm a teacher and spend the summer months in my parents' home in an idyllic location while my husband stays home. We've agreed a system that works for us. He joins us at the mid way point for a couple of weeks to break it up. He doesn't love it but, like you, doesn't want to hold us hostage. The walks and daily swims we do on holidays aren't possible where we live so he understands that it's easier to keep the kids entertained here. I wouldn't be happy at home, clock watching for husband to finish work. Plus, I have more support here than I would have at home. Both my parents are retired so I'm not alone all day referring hourly squabbles between three kids  Having said that, if he was really as depressed as you sound, I would revisit the issue. \nToo late to have a new system this year but could she delay going for a week, and return a week earlier? Cutting two weeks off your alone time. Place your vacation time in the middle and the whole summer seems less daunting.", "NAH\n\nI totally understand your wife and her desire to travel from the south during summer especially if she has community there. It\u2019s a nice break, fun and good.\nFly there for couple of weeks to see her if you miss her. Enjoy what she has an opportunity to take kids to travel. This is the best teaching benefit, I always envy teacher friends who travel with their kids whole summer", "NAH. She clearly misses her family and wants them to be involved in your kids' life. You don't want to be left alone at home which is also understandable... Would it be an option to find new jobs and to move near her family's place?", "Nah. I understand wanting to get out of the deep south. She's a teacher and she works in an area that's notoriously anti-education. \n\nIs she's from a northern state. She would probably have better job opportunities there. With a higher salary. And your children are most likely get a better education.", "NAH \n\nI can't imagine being a teacher in the South right now. That part of the country is so hostile to educators. I'm actually surprised she hasn't brought up moving back to where her family is from for good... repeatedly.That's not even mentioning what they're doing to actual education down there. Some states are trying to close public libraries that won't comply with book bans. I wouldn't want to have kids go to school in the South either.\n\nIt definitely sucks to be without your family for months, but man, it must be nice to get away from all that.", "NAH.  You guys need to really sit down and talk this out before next summer and come up with a compromise.\n\nBut you also need to figure some other things out.   If your wife doesn't want to host your family at your home then you need to figure out other ways to get your kids involved with your family.    If they live close, then grab the kids on Saturday and take them to grandma's house, etc.   Take charge of planning/arranging visits with your family.   That is not your wife's job or problem.   \n\nAnother thing is that you mention feeling like all you do is play cop to your kids -- that again is on you.  Do other things with them, be more involved with them.  Now that you don't have your weird schedule you need to reestablish routines.  Take your kids to do X every-other-Sunday.  The third Thursday of the month is Bowling With Dad.  Whatever it is that you want to do with your kids.   But if you want to spent or time with and have more fun with your kids, you just need to plan it and make it happen.", "INFO: How big is her family? Are the kids building relationships with aunts and uncles and cousins during the summers?", "NAH and from \u201cdeep south\u201d and \u201cone of the top 5 largest cities\u201d I am going to guess you are from Houston since that is the only city that fits. I am from that area and growing up I would have done anything to go somewhere else in the summer. It feels like literal hell. Most camps were not fun cause of the miserable heat and playing outside is the same thing. There have been constant extreme heat warning and when i visited recently I could not even stand outside without dripping in sweat. \n\nI am also struggling with not calling you the asshole since you reveal in your comments that part of the reason is jealousy due to her being around previous sexual partners. You are also acting like you can not spend any time with your kids during the school year. They still have weekends during the school year and you still have work during the summed, so what can you do with them in the summer that you are not able to do during the school year? \n\nI get where you are coming from but I am also really struggling with the fact that this entire post has been about you and your wife and what the two of you want and what is best for who. What about the kids? What do they want to do with their summers? Which is better for them. Because if I am right and you are from Houston, not only is the heat miserable this year, it is extremely dangerous. People (including my brother) are being hospitalized at alarming rates due to the heat.", "Firstly yous post is so dramatic. Every thing you hold dear is gone for 6 weeks ..... Yet you were fine when you worked 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. \n\nShe had to find a routine that works for her sanity, now she likes it clearly. \n\nNothing stopping you from using all your annual leave from your office job to go spend time with them. \n\nAnd have you thought that maybe she stresses about the house being clean when your family visit because they are judging her? And she feels pressure. \n\nAnd if you want to do something with them, before the summer comes plan something and plan it with the wife before she goes off for summer, so she knows there are plans in place that you have put effort into.\n\nAlso what do you expect her to do all summer to entertain the kids while you are busy working everyday. Please do share your thoughts on that.", "NAH\n\nFrom her point of view: she wants to see her family, doesn't like where you guys live in the summer, and this has been an annual tradition. Likely, this has probably previously been a way for her to get some extra help while you were away for work\n\nFrom your point, you want to spend more time with your family. That's normal. It sounds like you previously haven't been able to.\n\nThat said, I do think you need to compromise a bit here, especially with the comment you would not be willing to move closer to her family. She doesn't seem to like where you live. Letting her leave during the \"worst\" months for her is a good way to keep the peace. Furthermore, your kids likely have come to expect and look forward to these summers. I'd suggest you take a vacation to join them for a chunk and ask your wife to shorten it a bit next year. Gives your wife her family time still, but you get increased family time.\n\nFurthermore, recognize your comment about being near old flings is your own insecurities and your own problem, not a reason to demand your wife stay home. Your old career also created the conditions leaving her to feel a need to leave for stretches and that dynamic isn't going to change over night\n\nAlso, it seems like your wife is living down South for you to begin with, and you need to bear that in mind. If she actually doesn't like where you live, she is sacrificing a lot for you then, so I wouldn't use leaving for stretches as a way to question how much \"passion\" she has", "NAH in that you want to spend time with your family but your comments say you use up your holiday time to be with them anyway. What are they supposed to do when you\u2019re at work all day? It\u2019s not fair on your wife to expect her to take on all the extra stress of staying home with you when she can have consistent support elsewhere just because you are lonely.\nWhat do your kids think? Do you expect them to wait in all day for you to arrive home and then do something? Kids don\u2019t work like that.", "NAH ---- What is it that she does in her home state that she can't do at home with you??", "NAH. You need to talk to your wife and seek treatment for your depression. It's possible that you are not totally aware of what you're like to be around as a depressed person, especially if this has been going on for years. Her summers away from where you live (in the deep south, where women get treated horribly and it's hotter than Satan's asshole on the regular) with her support network might be the only thing keeping her in your marriage right now. If you want her to want to spend her and your children's summers with you, you'll probably need to listen more carefully to why she wants to go away (instead of making baseless assumptions about wealthy but not really parents and camp friends), and be open to working on yourself and getting better for your family's sake", "NAH. Honestly I get your perspective but you are also kind of holding them hostage still if there's nothing for them to do during the week while you work all summer. Taking 2 weeks of vacation to spend time with them also shouldn't be a burden. Could they take the dog when they travel so you could see them on weekends? Would it be reasonable to stay at home a few weeks, spend a month in her home state, then spend a few weeks at home? You should talk about this with your wife. Part of this might also be to do eith her wanting to see her family if she's in another state 10 months of the year so I think some kind of compromise would be best.", "NTA. Create a calendar of all the weekend events that you plan to do during the summer. Include the fun activities for the 2 weeks that you will be off. Show them to your kids and ask them to give any input for the activities. Tell your wife if she wants to go to her parents place she is on her own as you are using your vacation days to spend with your family,  not being her chauffeur.", "It depends what you two agreed on before you were married. She moved away from her family and friends to your home state in the Deep South. She has sacrificed a lot.", "I feel for you.  your kids and your wife leaving for ALL summer is rough.\n\nIt is Hot it the deep south.  She may also want your kids exposed to life outside of the Seep South.    \n\nForcing your wife and kids to stay home every summer is likely to damage your marriage.  It sounds like she needs to get away for the south and or have her family near her.\n\nHave you thought of looking for a job near where her family lives?\n\nNTA for missing your family.", "NTA, but your wife is probably having summer affairs.", "NTA. \n\nWhen I was young, my mum would drive us ten hours and four states to go stay with her family for a good portion of our summer breaks. She\u2019d stay with us the first week. Then leave us there to go home for two or three weeks and have some couple time with my dad. Then she\u2019d drive back and stay another week when she picked us up. \n\nYour wife can meet you in the middle. She is just refusing too.", "NTA. This sounds really hard. I used to have seasonal depression back when I lived in the Pacific Northwest, and I was miserable as fuck during the wintertime. You must be truly miserable to have seasonal depression during \\*the summer\\*.\n\nYou and your wife and her family need to figure out some solution. I get the impression that your wife simply hates the city you live in now, while you're happy with both cities. You mentioned they're wealthy as fuck; why can't they help you and your family move to where they are?", "there should be a compromise 1 month with her family and the rest of the summer at home planning activities. NTA and especially if she wants to go in winter break too, she shouldn't be there so long in the summer.", "NAH What do you expect them to do? Stay at home while you work? Your wife probably misses her family and wants her family to spend time with the kids too. Isn\u2019t a compromise possible? Can you join them longer? Can you take more time off to spend actually time together at home? I understand your feelings, but I don\u2019t think anybody gains if they stay at home while you work.", "NTA.\n\nGoing on a relatively short vacation with the kids is reasonable. Spending the entire summer and winter breaks in another state is not.\n\nYou are part of this family, and you have a right to have access to your children during the summer.\n\nYour wife is being unfair and ridiculously selfish.", "NTA. Your concerns are valid and I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA, not saying that you should, but it sounds as if you would get to see your kids more often if you divorced and got partial custody. At least you\u2019d get a couple weeks during the summer.", "NTA and I'm so sorry.", "NTA, she should definitely compromise here", "NTA\n\nYou have very valid feelings. You have conveyed them to your wife, who chooses to disregard them. She refuses to compromise and give both of you (and your children) the resulting benefits. Whether she means to or not, she is saying that her feelings and what she wants to do are all that matter to her.\n\nIt seems like maybe she is unwilling to accept that she is an adult with a family of her own, not a child with no responsibilities while school is out.\n\nFrom what I gather, not only are you left alone for an unbelievable length of time, but you are also expected to provide the funds to maintain the home as well as pay for their vacation.\n\nI can not imagine how she justifies any of this. She seems incredibly selfish and spoiled. I also doubt that it is limited to the summer months.\n\nI think she needs to grow up and be a real partner instead of treating the whole thing like a game of dress-up, where she can take off the high heels for nap time. \n\nI realize that you probably can't even consider breaking up, since she would most likely want to take your children and move back near her parents. \n\nI'm sorry that you are in such an unhappy situation, and I'm sorry that the person who is supposed to be concerned about your happiness is so self-absorbed and oblivious.", "NAH. I think there may be compromise though. Maybe the first (or last) 2 weeks of summer they could stay home, leave for the next 6 weeks but you could utilize vacation time & fly out for the middle 2 weeks? That way they still have 6 weeks away, but you\u2019re really only doing the 2:2 that you were doing before. The first 2 weeks might be a bit more boring for them, but would be the fair way to disperse the time in my opinion \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Man, if this was a woman saying this, the responders would be chewing the husband and call him terrible for taking the kids away from their mother and leaving her alone for an entire summer.\n\nNTA, mate. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Best advice I have is put your foot down, get a marriage counsellor and hopefully sort this out. This is disrespectful to you not only as a human being, but as a father and a man.\n\nWorking so hard to support them. And being treated like this is not acceptable.\n\nFor your dignity, do not tolerate this. Handle it maturely, seek counselling but don\u2019t let this slide.", "NTA. Seems really cool for them, but putting your life on hold twice a year? Your family? It sucks, but sometimes life gets busy. Maybe compromise with more vacations and visiting there together.", "NTA \n\nI think your feelings are very valid, given that your wife could get 80% of the time away that she does now and still be with you for a few weeks in the summer.\n\nIn addition, it is not fair to you as a dad, because you miss a lot of bonding opportunities with your children that are seasonally available, and instead those opportunities are going to your FIL.", "NTA, for your wife to spend every summer apart from you and take the kids with her, which leaves you alone every summer.

I too live in a very hot city, but it\u2019s not a reason to abandon my spouse. It\u2019s time to have a very frank discussion with her about your feelings on the matter.

Instead of being jealous of your loved ones, be happy that they get to have this great experience.", "YTA. \n\nI am both a teacher and someone who has grown up (and still lives) in the Deep South, with a father who worked the on-2 off-2 schedule for most of my time living at home. Some thoughts:\n\n1) It is hotter than Satan\u2019s cast iron skillet outside for the entire duration of the summer. It feels like you need to spontaneously evolve into a being with gills to comfortably breathe outside, and there is no level of thin clothing that stops sweat from dripping down your body. It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re in \u201ca major city with a ton of things to do\u201d if the things that involve air conditioning are going to a) be insanely packed and b) cost $40-$60 per person, per visit, plus parking, plus food. Any outdoor options are *not* viable for most people in the kind of heat being discussed here (which, as others have mentioned, have warranted severe heat warnings and yielded multiple hospitalizations already). You dismiss this as \u201ca few degrees,\u201d but I am FROM here and it is miserable. Your wife is NOT from here. \n2) Your wife, especially depending on her school and age level that she\u2019s teaching, puts up with some of the most sanctimonious bullshit that one can deal with and does so with kindness in her heart toward the children that she\u2019s working with every day. You are not living in a part of the nation that treats educators well. These two months might be THE THING that gets her through the absolute hell that can be March-May in education (AKA: testing season). \n3) That 2-on, 2-off schedule (though you don\u2019t work it now) means that routines get set in place by the consistently present parent. That means your wife and your two small children (though they are involved in extracurriculars and have homework, so we may have different definitions of \u201csmall child,\u201d) have a routine in place that all of them enjoy. My dad often hated this, but the consistency of us having our routines was more important than his frustration. Have you actually ASKED your wife, in DETAIL, why it is that she insists on spending the whole summer there? What is she getting there that she isn\u2019t getting in your home state (other than tolerable weather and family support that she doesn\u2019t have in your state)? Would you still be responding this way if your kids were at sleep-away camp for 6-8 weeks of the summer and your wife was at home? \n4) You say your FIL \u201cgets the fun stuff\u201d and you\u2019re just the guy who tells them to do their homework and go to bed. Then you also say that you\u2019re super involved in all their extracurriculars and are present for all the things. Those two realities cannot co-exist. You\u2019re either doing nothing but \u201cbeing the bad guy,\u201d or you\u2019re super involved. Which is it?", "Thank you! I appreciate your insight.", "I appreciate your detailed response.

Plenty of grandparents actively spend time with their grandchildren and the said grandchildren are still able to make the difference between their parents and the grandparents. \n\nSame goes for your fears about your wife\u2019s infidelity and seeing old friends.

And as an adult, I CANNOT imagine staying home with two bored, restless kids all day long by myself, feeling trapped, when I could be enjoying free housing with my parents in a place where my kids had other kids right there to play with, and tons of activities to do.\n\nYou don't want to move, this is the compromise. You complain about your FIL getting all this time, but what are you doing after work during the school year to spend time with your kids? Why is it that ONLY the summertime, when they're off all day, will make the memories you want to make? You working from home three days a week isn't giving them great childhood memories; if nothing else, you're imposing your expectation that they would be home with you those three days so you can get your quality time. What fun they would have! /s\n\nYou also dismiss the time you spent away, but your wife bore the brunt of parenting during the younger years when things are a lot harder, and had to be a single mom for HALF of the year. Now she wants to enjoy her children while they're older, and you're feeling left out so you want to put a stop to it. I think you need to be a lot more reasonable. Get back into therapy and figure out where these feelings are coming from, try to get a reality check on your level of reasonableness, and when your family returns at the end of the year have a couples counselor lined up so you and your wife can work through this issue over the next year, to see if there's some compromise to be had or not.", "Honestly, I think you're in the wrong here.

If that's the case, you may need to accept that you guys are incompatible because she seems to have a close and good relationship with them. If she doesn't like where you are enough to stay a summer when she doesn't have work to distract her, you cannot tolerate her leaving a summer, and you are unwilling to relocate, you guys may actually be at an impasse.

I understand the modern age of individualism and all of that fun stuff, but IMO when you marry someone, you kind of sacrifices some of those previously fun singles activities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do trust my wife. I don't like the situations she's in & she definitely would not like it (and would tell me about it) if i were to be out drinking past midnight with previous sexual partners.", "You\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t, because we don\u2019t invest our time in it. She doesn\u2019t at least. I am friends with everyone in our neighborhood", "Thank you", "I'm definitely not a saint, I've made mistakes (nothing dealing with fidelity) but I think that every thing i've done for the past 5 years has been to strengthen our family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that this is short sighted and selfish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your post.", "What does that mean?\n\nShe is absconding with the kids for 25% of the year.  \n\nBeing a school teacher has the advantage of spending more time with your children. That is the bonus.\n\nWhen you are in a marriage and have children together, you don't get to fuck off with the kiddos for a huge percentage of the time.\n\nShe built this life.

I haven't gotten anywhere. I just want half of the summer with my kids - exactly what a divorced father would get. I honestly want the time with my wife too, that would be wonderful.", "I unfortunately agree - it's such a sad thought, breaks my heart", "That\u2019s all I want - some sort of middle ground.", "I actually might try this - thank you.", "Info-\nWhat are you calling the \u201cwhole summer\u201d?\n\nWhen do they leave and return, and how does that align with school schedule?\n\nDo you have vacation days, and when/how does your family vacation?", "It sounds like a rough situation, it's hard when an agreement can't be reached. \n\nMaybe it's a good time to visit your family? Indulge your interests? Solo weekend trips/activities?", "Ok but you have your kids for the whole year? Like I completely understand wanting to spend your vacation time all together instead of at your in-laws but I don\u2019t get wanting your family to be stuck in a hot climate while you are working.\n\nAlso, while you are working, your wife is supposed to be the one taking care of the kids while at her parents, she has her family to help her.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m biased  because my parents would send me off for the summer for 2.5 months with other family members (both sets of grandparents, my aunt, etc). The reason being was that instead of staying in a hot and dusty city, I would get a chance to met other children, have access to swimming, kayaking in the lake and plenty of other activities. I would normally spend about week and a half with my parents during summer.\n\nI don\u2019t have kids yet but my hubby already gets almost a double of vacation time that I do so he will most probably take the kids to visit his home country and other places with our future kids while I will be working. I\u2019ll probably miss them but I would never stop my family from experiencing good things only because I can\u2019t. Your wife clearly sees that as something very important to her and you are trying to take it away.", "I think from your wife\u2019s perspective, the countless parks are a no.  That\u2019s not a feasible daytime option in the Deep South.  Summer programs are also probably hot and miserable.  4 outdoor water things are possible I guess, but that\u2019s not a realistic plan for the whole summer. \n\nI understand wanting to be involved in their lives.  But it feels like you care more about yourself than them.  This is all about you being bored and lonely (and mostly insecure and jealous of your wife) it doesn\u2019t at all seem to be about what\u2019s best for your kids.", "No, don\u2019t listen to them. Their take is ridiculous. You sound like a damn good husband and father that wants to spend more time with his family. You changed your career for them.

How can anyone pretend that it\u2019s normal to want to leave your spouse for _2 months_?!", "My husband and I would work out what was best for our family unit and we trust one another. Again it sounds more and more like you think she will cheat rather than that you just miss her and the kids. Is the price comparable between locations for camps? Do you 2 have a support system in your current state? Are there opportunities there for networking which might be useful later for the kids? There are lots of factors. I think there should be some compromise but again the fact you think she's spending quality time with people she used to know as a major point here is telling.", "When the relationship is secure, sure. I\u2019m going on an overnight road trip with an ex, sharing a room, and we\u2019ll likely have a beer while we\u2019re out.

My GF sometimes has a male friend over and they\u2019ll each have a glass of wine. \n\nWhat\u2019s NOT happening is we\u2019re not drinking past the point of control alone with a member of the opposite sex where an \u201cOops!\u201d could happen.\n\nBut it sounds like you don\u2019t trust her or her love for you and are worried about more than an \u201cOops\u201d moment. That\u2019s why couples therapy.", "> Would you be totally fine being away from your spouse for two months knowing that she/he was co-mingling with old companions? drinking with old companions? late nights drinking with old companions?\n\nAnd now we get the truth -- you're mad your wife is around her old friends, and  the kids are an excuse for why you don't want her to see her family.", "So from where I'm sitting, it sounds like the real problem here is that you two are talking cross-class.\n\nTo you, this was originally not an issue because you assumed two things: her summering with her family was temporary and it was in response to you and your specific circumstances. Ergo, when your circumstances changes, of course your wife would adjust!\n\nWhereas,  to your wife, summering with the family in the place you've always been is simply the continuation of a cherished family tradition, and an opportunity for her children to have the same experiences and same sense of family history she has. Summering with her family has nothing to do with how she feels about *you*; it's about the longer story of who she is and where she comes from.\n\nYou don't mention much about your background, but from your replies, it seems like your core assumption is that a person becomes an adult with their own independent family unit once they marry. Your wife may not share this assumption. Her perception of when people become adults and how families work may be different, and shaped by her upbringing.\n\nYour resistance to your wife's summer plans and your insistence that she and the kids can just do stuff locally is understandable: you want that sense of a solid family unit in which you are a cherished and important central figure and part of their summers.\n\nBut you're deprecating something your wife and kids value, i.e. the tradition and experience of spending \"the summer\" in the same place with the same people doing the things they like to do. The sense of familial continuity can be a tremendous source of stability in healthy families.\n\nSo long as your wife *perceives* you as not understanding or valuing how important this is to her and the kids -- whether or not that perception is fair or true -- she's not going to be open to negotiating about how she spends her summers. Especially if what you're asking requires her to do more work in an unpleasantly hot place away from people she knows and likes and loves and doesn't get to see often.\n\nYou are certainly entitled to feel your feelings! But they may be rooted in longer-simmering disconnects over your perceptions of what marriage and family life are \"supposed to\" look like or what you prefer. It might be worth exploring with a third party, just so you two can understand that neither of you is acting from a place of malice or indifference, simply different \"normal\"s.", "This is the comment I was waiting to see tbh. Some time apart is natural but 2 straight months every year really isn\u2019t especially taking the kids from you. Honestly my first thought was there\u2019s someone specific in that state she\u2019s going to see. \n\nSome comments here are trippin. Shes taking your kids for 2 months straight and when they come back its all homework, school bedtimes etc not the fun summer shit. \n\nI think you need couples counseling more than individual therapy tbh because this isn\u2019t a healthy relationship", "Sounds like you both have two different versions of marriage and your wife doesn\u2019t respect you. Those are huge problems.", "Are you from the city you're currently living in?  Or had connections to said city before you were married?\n\nIt's hard to make friends and form a sense of community as an adult.  I've been in the \"fish out of water\" situations before (ie being a nonbeliever in the Bible Belt) and it's not easy.

I\u2019m a single dad and agree that if you divorced you\u2019d almost certainly see your kids more. My daughter\u2019s an adult and the longest I was apart from her growing up was five days in a row.

She needs to understand his side too but op does need to look at it that way to calm him down.", "Thank you, I appreciate that. \n\nIt seems like people will either read it like I wrote it, or like I\u2019m some overbearing jealous asshole. \n\nI\u2019ve spent years trying to grow closer to my wife.

That's more security than i think i would ever have. I applaud that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that therapy would/will be beneficial. I have tried for that, but there is always an excuse of the busy school year, which leads me right back to the summer. We could and should be growing together, not apart.", "You got me! Screw the kids! .... cmon dude.", "Wow, I really liked your response. I promise I approached this from a place of love and understanding from the start. I am only posting here and sounding frustrated because it\u2019s been 3 years and I am frustrated, and sad.  \n\nI get that the family traditions of her birth family are important, and I don\u2019t want to erase them, but I would like some time to define who we are as a family outside of the academic year.", "Thank you, I agree.", "Unfortunately I agree with you.", "That's a sad (but true) assessment. Thank you for your input.", "Where are you seeing that?  I only saw in a comment that he had exhausted his vacation.\n\nSummer break is usually 10-12 weeks, which is why I\u2019m trying to understand when they are actually gone.  Ie- if their break is 12 wks and they are gone 8, and he could visit on a few of his long weekends and they are home for 4 wks of the summer- that is not quite as bad.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to offer potential solutions without knowing the actual dates, distances involved, etc. I think a full 8 wks straight is a long absence, but it seems like those dates could be arranged with some visits in between to create some balance.", "How. Because during your work hours you would be working while she is doing the parenting and entertaining.", "It absolutely would be all on her shoulders as you'd be working. Couldn't you negotiate with your employer to work remotely for a few weeks at her parents? Could you spend every other week with them working remotely 3 days and weekending 2 more days with them for a total of 1 month apart with regular visits?", "I feel for you, man. I get the sense that you feel you don't have any support and know that's tough to deal with.\n\nI've seen a couple of people suggest therapy to discuss these matters, I'd recommend that too. Go into it with no particular goal besides needing to have someone to vent your feelings to.\n\nI imagine, over time, you will grow a sense of clarity and maybe even discover a long-term solution to fix the overriding problem. \n\nBottom line, do what you can to ensure you don't spend another depressed summer at home all alone.", "It may be the solution you don\u2019t expect. It may be your wife doesn\u2019t actually want to move home and live through a real winter. Perhaps enough to compromise and not leave for as much of the summer. Or you may get to spend every weekend of the summer with your kids in great weather doing whatever it is they do\u2026 \n\nOne thing I\u2019d say is be solution oriented perhaps moving to a third location where the summers aren\u2019t as bad is the solution. Mostly what I hear is the current status quo does not work for you. There are more solutions though than your family just not going.", "Yup put a card in each hand.
