{"id": 1408, "submission_id": "ymf340", "title": "AITA For Asking My Friend To Not Be So Touchy With My Boyfriend?", "selftext": " I (16f) Recently introduced my friend Megan (14f) and my Boyfriend (16m) to each other seeing as we hang out at school a lot, I\u2019ve known Megan since middle school, her older brother and I are very close friends. Megan is a freshmen at my highschool while me and my boyfriend are both Juniors. Recently Megan has been hugging my boyfriend and a bit more and is often touchy with him, I didn\u2019t mind it at first as I myself have male friends seeing as i hug them a lot too. But as of lately Megan would kinda nudge me out of the way while I was hugging my boyfriend to hug him. I thought it was odd seeing as she hasn\u2019t ever done that to anyone in the past. And she would give me a weird look when giving him a hug. I haven\u2019t said anything because my boyfriend hasn\u2019t given me a reason not to trust him. My boyfriend has asked her in the past not to be so touchy with him as he has a girlfriend, she said okay and that was that. I don\u2019t know why but for some reason I feel like she has a crush on him and she\u2019s trying to get me out of the picture. I pulled her aside one day while we were grabbing lunch and asked her to not be so touchy with my boyfriend as it made me uncomfortable. She immediately flipped the switch and snapped at me saying \u201cI\u2019m just being a good friend to him what the fuck is your problem it\u2019s not even a big deal, so what?\u201d In a super rude tone. I don\u2019t know why she would say that too me. I asked her why she would say that and she gave me a nasty look and said \u201cYour boyfriend is hot. You should have expected this stop being so insecure.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at her.  I just left. And I haven\u2019t talked to her in a few days, she\u2019s been blowing up my phone since then. \n\n\nSo AITA For Asking My Friend To Not Be So Touchy With My Boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1667607832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymf340/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_not_be_so_touchy/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
