You\u2019re just the first, or because you\u2019re family and therefore a \u201csafe\u201d person to blow up at you got the brunt of the anger. She\u2019ll either figure out or have to be told that her expectations are well outside of social norms, that going to a wedding is always a financial burden on guest, whether it\u2019s because of flights, hotels, has to drive there, clothing (especially for the wedding party), gifts, etc, and all those are often multiplied by more and more events these days [a bachelor/ette party has become a destination weekend, there is a bridal shower (sometimes more than one of the two families don\u2019t get along, don\u2019t live near each other, a separate family then friends shower, etc), rehearsal dinner, the wedding itself which may or may or be a destination wedding, and often a day after brunch]. The last wedding I went to had four events in the three or four days around the wedding (and I may be forgetting something) and was at the brides parents summer home. They lived on a different continent and the summer home was on an island off the coast of a state a handful of the guests actually lived in. The island is only accessible by a ferry and no cars are allowed. Which makes sense, there are no roads, only paved paths. So for me to get there I had to fly, then catch a ride to the hotel, then the next day we had a bridal lunch, the next day we all had to catch the right ferry\u2019s to go to another island for the rehearsal dinner/crab boil/ walk around a historical site. Then back to the mainland via ferry, before the wedding on the island the next day, with brunch the next morning. Luckily I 1$ really liked the bride and groom and 2) my parents foot the bill for my sister and I to go because there was no way we could have afforded it on our own (sis was in a low paying job and I\u2019d just finished undergrad and was working until I moved to the country the bride and groom lived in for grad school). I can\u2019t imagine my parents spent less than three grand on getting my sister and I there and housed, plus the various odds and ends expenses. They were already up there staying with a friend on the island. But they would have bought them gifts costing at least $500. If they hadn\u2019t been vacationing there they probably would have spent $7K at a minimum for us to attend and none of us had to buy clothes for it. \nNow the bride is the person my mom called at 6 am local time to tell her my dad had died very suddenly and she immediately got in the car to come get me despite the fact she was having a big bbq type party that night. Mom woke me up at 8 am to let me know and the friend was there half an hour after I woke up. I had time to go tell security she was coming and to please let her in before throwing a few things in a bag and meeting her. I didn\u2019t even have time/brain power to put a bra on. She and her husband provided exactly what I needed that weekend- a distraction in the form of party prep then the party, a space to retreat to when I was overwhelmed, and amazing people, a very few of whom knew what had happened, but those people and the ones who found out were so remarkably supportive to a complete stranger. It was worth every penny to go to there wedding and would have been even if that whole event hadn\u2019t happened because they are just amazing people, but I can 100% understand the expense of being s guest at a wedding. \nOh I forgot my cousin got married one summer when I was in grad school. It was a destination wedding and it only happened because my grandpa paid for it. Her brother also did a destination wedding but a lot closer to home and far less expensive for guest (I have no idea which got married first, my memory is clinically awful, and have no idea who paid for the family to go to it). \nDon\u2019t be surprised when wedding arrangements change to something more reasonable when a large percentage of guests decline the invite, the contribution, and send them a toaster. Reality will hit, just be gracious when the family trashing you now apologizes, but also don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t apologize or acknowledge how horrible they\u2019ve been, admitting your wrong isn\u2019t easy for a lot of people. I\u2019d be very surprised if your sister apologizes and realizes she was wrong, or admits it if people point it out to her + point out she owes you an apology.
