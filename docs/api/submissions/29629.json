The guests should pay for the wedding? Ludicrous. Not only wouldn\u2019t I go, but for a gift I would send a book on proper etiquette. This takes bridezillas to a whole new level.", "NTA.  Destination weddings are a scourge in general.  Expecting guests to contribute beyond a gift and their own travel expenses is money-grubbing AH behavior.", "NTA she sounds awful. Asking your guests to fund your wedding is so incredibly tacky and tasteless, I would be surprised if anyone wants to come. It\u2019s no longer a wedding, it\u2019s a fundraiser.", "NTA. if they want you to attend,  they should pay your expenses. otherwise nah, you don't have to throw money into the wind.\n\nsure family is important,  but your sister forgot about it herself when she chose to do a lavish wedding and burden her family and friends with the costs.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you're not necessarily refusing, but more unable to attend. How anyone thinks its ok to put yourself in a major financial bind for something thats a luxury and not a necessity is beyond me! It's reasons like this that I'd be more than willing to cut off family as they see you as nothing more than financial support and not as actual family.", "Tell one of them to pay for you then.

This is ridiculous.", "[removed]", "NTA -  if you need to ask your guests to pay for the wedding you can't afford that wedding, either downsize or wait until you can. \n\nIf you do decide to go ahead and ask guests to pay for the wedding you have to expect that some people will decline the invitation.  Especially when you expect a gift too.", "NTA.  This growing trend of asking for family and friends to go into debt to finance another person's \"dream day\" is absurd.  There is NO way I would dip into my savings or put myself in a financial bind for a damn wedding.  Hill to die on.", "NTA. Prioritize a one-day event (for a person who can't afford it) over your own financial security? Have your parents gone mad? Your parents can finance this nonsense if it's that important to them.", "Nta.  Let them go and let them all pay.

Anyone who expects anyone else to pay for an extravagant wedding ( except I guess deluded parents who are willing to do so) is an entitled AH. And a destination wedding to boot! How will people fund her dreams and attend. I guess they should forgo basic necessities for the privilege of attending this royal event. \n\nLet your family go broke feeding into her delusions of grandeur. I don\u2019t blame you for steering clear of this train wreck. She will be a nightmare, and probably ungrateful if she doesn\u2019t get every last thing she wants as well.

This is such a messed up situation and the fact that your family is supporting your sister in this asinine idea is just flat out irresponsible of them, especially of your parents. No one should expect a family member to go into debt or even make any significant financial sacrifices for something as unessential as a wedding ceremony.", "NTA - feel like this is a repost \n\nBut if you cant afford a wedding, youre fine not to go.", "NTA.\n\nIt's understandable for your sister to want something big and extravagant, coming from a modest background. For destination weddings, it's not uncommon for guests to have to pay their own way.\n\nHowever, that being said, she has no right to expect her guests to pay for her wedding. If it's something beyond her means, then she needs to tone it down. It's fine for guests to offer to help pay for things, or to give a gift of money, but for her to ask is not only out of line, it's incredibly tacky.\n\nIf you can't afford to go, then you simply can't afford to go.
