Or since they knew ahead of time there was going to be a drill they should have advised/allowed staff and students to bring their gear into the classroom so everyone would be protected while standing outside.

Subjecting them to inclement weather without protection from the elements and then expecting them to proceed with the rest of their classes while cold and wet is ridiculous and a dereliction of duty.

And I bet staff is PISSED at the principal too. Schools are absolutely required to hold drills at a set number per month/year/semester depending on the state. Yours may have put it off so late that they couldn't reschedule it. No school I have ever worked at would even CONSIDER a fire drill in the rain. Misting, MAYBE. And you can bet that if your shirt was wet and see-through that sort of school would have jumped all over you for inappropriate conduct. Please notify the school board that your principal scheduled a Wet Tshirt Contest that day and that the principal deliberately set up a situation that left every female in the school in wet clothing stuck to their skin for hours. Anyone wearing a white or light-colored shirt would have had it see-through. YOU may not have thought of that, but honestly? Pulling a fire drill in pouring rain? That wouldn't be the creepiest thing I know of a school administrator doing. Get your female friends together, your male friends who are offended on your behalf, tell the parents and school board what happened.

I would've perhaps volunteered going out in the rain without proper clothing as long as I was allowed to go home after. They can't have the cake and eat it.

And sometimes they can't, because the fire marshal has to be there and they have other stuff to do. \n\nHowever, it wasn't rescheduled. So unfortunately, you have to do what the teachers are telling you to do. Everyone else went and has to get soaked, sorry to be blunt, but you aren't special or any more important. I'm sure none of your classmates or even teachers felt like spending the rest of the day soaking wet, but they all went.", "ESH They should have re-scheduled.

Sometimes when you are an adult or close to it, you have to do things you don't like or agree with but they are expected.  What made you above everyone else in the school that had to go outside in the rain.  Usually when there is a drill, the fire department is usually involved and grades the school.  I know when I used to be a teacher it was part of our state funding formula that we were meeting our drill requirements.  It's a required activity for the school to conduct.  Thinking you are more special than everyone else makes YTA.", "YTA. having been in a major fire, I walked out alive thankfully. fire drills are extremely important. during a real fire, it is so easy to get turned around, panicked, and DEAD!! fire drills work like muscle memory, you practice. you don't stop to get your coat. also in areal situation it has been arranged to give firefighters the best access, your teacher were ear the door to prevent anyone from going back in the building.", "[removed]", "Yta", "ESH\n\nHonestly I'm shocked your school didn't have everyone grab their coats before the drill if it was raining. That was the norm for my schools, so that's pretty messed up. Also staff should have been right in the rain with y'all.\n\nYou're an AH because you not being with your class or even just outside extends how long everyone is out in the rain. The sooner the count is back to the principal the sooner everyone can dry off. And depending on how long you would have taken, your school can get dinged by the fire marshall which can lead to another fire drill.", "YTA  for possibly making the fire departments job harder.
