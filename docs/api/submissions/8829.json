We were never close while I was growing up, and there is a whole myriad of reasons that myself and my younger siblings (all in their mid 20\u2019s) dislike him. From our early teens, he has been sexualising me and my sisters, commenting on how big our boobs were, touching my sisters\u2019 boyfriend\u2019s penis over his pants to \u2018make sure it works\u2019, etc. He even makes our partners feel uncomfortable, comments about my brother and SIL\u2019s weight and is just overall so incredibly offensive, inappropriate and crass. \n\nWhen I was 15, he was going through a divorce and took me on a cruise (tickets were non-refundable). While it was a lovely thing to do (he could have easily taken somebody else), he still holds it over my head in literally every single conversation we have. When we returned, he told my whole family I swore at him and was misbehaved in general (I wasn\u2019t). Our relationship has been non-existent since this occurred. I don\u2019t go out of my way to talk to him, but I don\u2019t ignore him in conversations, etc. \n\nHere is where it may be TA. Recently it was my mum\u2019s 50th birthday. My sister, Dad and I spent months planning the surprise, booked an Airbnb and invited the whole family. I was one of the first to arrive with my partner, 5yo & 4mo. Aside from that, it was just my mum, dad, grandparents and uncle so far. I had been fighting with my partner all morning, so the vibes were tense (money, Christmas, significant birthdays, shit gets expensive). After our 2-hour car trip, we pulled up, and my uncle immediately came up to my car window, cupped his hands and started peering in my driver's side window, trying to open my door handle while I was looking and him asking what he was doing and to give me a bit of space. We hadn\u2019t even gotten the kids out of the car, unpacked our car, etc. \n\nOnce we got our stuff inside and the kids out of the car, I properly greeted everyone with a hug and a kiss. I walk upstairs to greet my mum, nan and uncle, and I hear him yelling about me before I even reach the top of the stairs. I told him I could hear him talking about me, and he started screaming at me, calling me rude and a bitch; I was ungrateful and mentioned the cruise again. He began ranting about how he \u201cpays my wages\u201d (he banks with the bank I work for. I work in HR, so not relevant at all?) and that he\u2019s a customer. I laughed in his face, and he got increasingly angry, grabbed his keys and left. My mum was trying to diffuse the situation and was upset that we couldn\u2019t have a drama-free event, while my grandmother agreed with him and is basically ignoring me now except to see my baby daughter.\n\nAll my other family members agreed with me and were pleased that he wasn\u2019t there for the weekend, but I feel awful knowing I put a dampener on her special weekend. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675223240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qjos3/aita_for_not_acknowledging_my_uncle_at_a_family/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That seems normal to him?", "NTA. your uncle and his temper tantrum ruined the weekend all by themselves. the fact that your mom and nan excuse his behavior is nasty. in the most respectful way possible, get your kids away from all of them. there\u2019s no way your moms side of the family doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s done and who he is and they\u2019ll continue to not pretend if(god forbid) he ever had access to your kids.", "NTA.

If he shows up at a gathering where you and/or your kids are, leave. Don't go to any event where you know he will be there, especially not with your kids. Give your family fair warning that you are going to take these actions, and that he is NOT welcome at YOUR home, so if he were to show up you WILL be calling the police on him for trespassing. Your family may get a little angry (although my guess is it will really only be mom, grandma, and uncle) but the majority of your family will likely calm down and back you up if you explain that you have had enough of his verbal abuse and you also refuse to subject your kids to him and his vitriol. He touched a (teen?) boy inappropriately. That is SA. It doesn't matter that it was \"over his clothes\", it's still SA. You may also need to cut off your mom and grandma. Again, for your children's sake. When they complain, tell them that he is more important to them than any of their children and grandchildren and while that is their choice, your children are more important to you than they are and especially him. Let them know that while you love them (but not him), your children and their safety and wellbeing will ALWAYS come first. Also if he keeps bringing up that cruise and trying to hold it over your head, nip that one in the bud by figuring out roughly how much the one ticket cost him then put together the money (even if it's bit by bit) and as soon as you have that money give it to him and tell him it's to pay him back for that cruise so that now he has nothing to complain about since he no longer lost anything by taking you. The biggest thing though is the threat to your children's safety from his verbal abuse at the minimum, and possibly worse since he already has a history of SA even if it was never reported.", "NTA. Sounds like *your uncle* ruined your mom\u2019s birthday by throwing a tantrum.", "NTA for trying to get away from him. I would distance myself from people who want to defend his behavior.", "NTA \n\nNarcissistic family members are the absolute worst.
