She was an accidental pregnancy with my boyfriend of 3.5 years, who was killed by a drunk driver when I was 6 months pregnant. Through the past couple of years I\u2019ve gone through hell and back, but I am damn proud to say that I\u2019ve made it through.   \n\nThe problem I\u2019m having now is that my mum keeps disrespecting my boundaries about my daughter - for example, I never want her face in social media posts until she can make that decision herself. I also try my best to not resort to screens (tv/ipad) to keep her entertained or calm her down. (This is just to name a couple of key things)  \n\nWell this Christmas, not only did my mum post several pictures of her on social media - including one of her in the bath - but her Christmas present to her was an ipad mini, with loads of videos and toddler apps already downloaded on it. This is not her first time doing this kind of thing; when my girl was younger my mum always just did things her way when \u2018helping me\u2019, disrupting routines and going behind my back to raise her how she thought she should be raised.   \n\nWhen I confronted her about these things, she got upset with me and told me that I\u2019m \u2018only nineteen\u2019 and \u2018way too immature to know how to raise a baby\u2019. She was insistent that she was doing me a favour, and when my girl grew up I\u2019d be thankful. This pissed me off beyond words, and I told her to back the fuck off, and that I\u2019ve had to do a hell of a lot of maturing lately. I also told her that while I\u2019m only nineteen, she\u2019s only a grandma, and has no right to parent my child for me when I\u2019ve asked her not to.   \n\nShe just clammed up and left my flat without saying anything else. While at first I stood by what I said, I now think I was too harsh - I still do think those things, but I also think it was cruel to say it that way, since she has helped me so much both with my grief and being a young mum. But at the same time, her comments really got to me. I\u2019ve done my best for my daughter, and honestly think I\u2019m a good mum all things considered. It upset me to think my boyfriend would be disappointed in how our baby is growing up.   \n\nI love my mum, of course I do, but my daughter is and always will be my number one, and so I\u2019m completely torn on this. My girl also loves her grandma, so I\u2019m desperate not to take that relationship away from her by being petty.

Though, I will say, she probably would have still undermined you regardless of the age you had your first child. It seems to just be *the thing*. You may want to apologize for being so harsh but tell her that she needs to respect your choices, even if they aren't hers. And that you will not let her see the baby if she ever posts her on social media again. That needs to be a hard line, no-nonsense, \"My baby is not going to be online until she decides to be,\" stance.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve been through so much and you deserve someone who will support you and not undermine you.\n\nThere are lots of people who don\u2019t put photos of their kids on social media and don\u2019t give their children iPads etc.  It\u2019s definitely not so far from the norm that it would make sense for your mother to countermand you.", "NTA\n\nYour mum doesn\u2019t respect you as a mother, she\u2019s made that clear by disrespecting and stomping over all of your boundaries. You\u2019ve said what you said and it can\u2019t be taken back however what you said was justified. You are your daughters mother, your mother is not she is by your good gracious a grandmother. She\u2019s not a second or third parent.", "NTA. As \"only a grandma\" myself, I know there are things that only my daughter and SIL, as the parents can permit. \nFunny how the one who is \"way too immature to know how to raise a baby\" was the one actually protecting the child. You were 100% right in keeping her off social media as much as you can with...\nKeep up your boundaries and stay strong, mama bear", "NTA.  NTA.  NTA.\n\nYou are doing your daughter a HUGE favor by setting very reasonable boundaries about how she is to be raised.  You are doing her a HUGE favor by refusing to let grandma stomp on those boundaries.  Your mom is not upset because of you, she's upset because she's coming to the realization that she doesn't get to run around doing whatever she wants and she has to treat other adults with respect, even if those adults are her kids.  If your kid no longer has a relationship with grandma because of this, you are not taking away that relationship, GRANDMA is taking away the relationship by refusing to be respectful to the child's parent.", "NTA. Your child, your rules.", "NTA.\n\nThere is only so many times that you can tell someone kindly that they are undermining your parenting\u2014 regardless of their role in your life. It\u2019s not up to anyone to decide what you\u2019ll be grateful for in the long run. If there are certain things you would prefer not to expose your child to that should be respected. You need time to figure out what is going to work best for you and your little unit\u2014 folks need to be okay with allowing young first time parents that opportunity.", "NTA. It was pretty cold how you put it, but in view of how routinely she violates the boundaries you set as a parent & the absolutely patronizing way she talks down to you, so what? It's perfectly understandable that you would snap at her, she earned however cold of a response you chose to deliver.", "NTA- your mum is crossing serious boundaries. Hopefully you two can talk about it calmly and reach an understanding.", "NTA at all because you\u2019re absolutely right. *You* are the mother and she is just the grandmother, and she needs to respect your rules for your daughter. Your mom had her turn in raising a kid with you. Now it\u2019s your turn, so what you say goes, period. And she needs to respect that. Your age doesn\u2019t matter. Legally you are an adult and as long as your daughter is getting what she needs (love, food, shelter, clothes), which it sounds she is, that\u2019s what matters. Parents can make mistakes no matter how old they are. All we can do is try our best. \n\nDon\u2019t back down on what you said. Yes, it was harsh but it sounds like she needed a hard truth to be told. I imagine it might be tough for her seeing her baby (which you\u2019ll always be in her heart) having a baby, but she needs to respect you as a woman and mother now. Don\u2019t feel bad about setting firm boundaries for your daughter.

If you need it explained I can defiantly do that.", "NTA. But I hope you mend fences with your mom. And look ... Maybe be a bit flexible with your rules, ok? Screens, for example ... OP, I truly loathe the way so many parents nowadays depend on screens to raise their kids! So I applaud you for minimizing your daughter's exposure. On the other hand, the crap on the screens has be one enmeshed in our culture,xand if she's totally cut off, she's going to feel left out when she starts to make friends at preschool and school. Also there are a FEW things she can learn from screens - or so I'm told. I'm an old lady so I actually don't know.\n\nSo how about you make your home a 90% screen-free zone, and send the iPad back to grandmas house, and let that be one of the things she does with grandma? It's not as though you live with your mom, so you can still limit her access, but dialing down the arguments is important too.", "nta", "NTA \n\nYou are the parent. Full stop. What you say goes. \n\nPlus, posting child in bathtub? Absolutely not.", "NTA - the boundaries you\u2019re setting are fair. People might have differing opinions on the use of screens, the photographs (especially bath photographs) should be non-negotiable. Age does not equate to maturity, and as you say, you\u2019ve done a lot of maturing in a short span of time.

Regarding social media, even tough my kids nieces and all will have their kid\u2019s pictures on it. I will ask permission before I will share it.

Family fight, you both could have worded things kinder but heat of the moment can make our words more spicy. I'm sure you will be able to resolve this.", "NTA.

Would she have tolerate this behavior from someone when she was raising you?  Probably not.  And, would this be different if you were 25? Probably not.  She wants it to be her way, and you don't have to tolerate that.  She can get it in line or jump off.", "Ask her how old she was when she had you and how long she'd been with her partner.
