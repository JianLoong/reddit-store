{"id": 18472, "submission_id": "13uw7b9", "title": "AITA for not wanting to take my boyfriend\u2019s daughter with me back to my home state?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve (28F) been dating Jack (30M) for 5 years. I\u2019ve also met his child, Cece (13F) and we have a pretty good relationship. His baby mother though, is a different story. She is incredibly paranoid, distrusting, and overprotective over Cece. There\u2019s also some tension with her due to the fact that she never truly got over Jack breaking up with her a decade ago. Thus, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s really truly warmed up to me because I\u2019m \u201cstill a stranger.\u201d\n\nA couple days ago I went to Cali to spend time with my family. I haven\u2019t seen them in half a year and I missed them a lot. Jack rings me up and tells me Cece is around the area too; her family drives down south frequently. On the day my parents drive me back home, which is the neighboring state 4hrs away, he tells me I should bring Cece with me, and my parents drive her back to Cali afterwards. I\u2019m hesitant. I know for a fact her mom will NOT allow it. When my parents drop me off, they\u2019ll immediately drive back. Furthermore, Jack works night shift. He\u2019ll either be asleep when I get there, awake but have little time to spend with Cece, or will be sleep deprived and have difficulty focusing on his 12hr job. I also feel Cece will be uncomfortable throughout the road trip. She\u2019s wildly different from my sisters, and is usually glued to her phone on Tiktok and doesn\u2019t make small talk. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t Jack come with me? He\u2019s low on PTO and refuses to take days off. He also didn\u2019t know Cece was in my area until the middle of my trip. I\u2019m mostly afraid of her relatives because they\u2019re quite mean and toxic towards anyone they\u2019re not familiar with. So I refused his request. He got mad and told me that Cece was my \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and that I should help him more with getting to spend time together.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDIT:** I need to address this. My boyfriend is *not* an uninvolved father. His baby mother deliberately hides or alters information from him, and Cece is at that age where she doesn\u2019t want to be babied, and sometimes ignores or withholds things from him because she hates how clingy he can be. He really tries his best and I see him get really sad about being far from his daughter. Moving closer isn\u2019t an option right now because of his job which pays very well, and our location is also affordable. Courts are not involved which they prefer, though I suspect things may change. Either way please don\u2019t call him a bad father, because he\u2019s not. It was just irritating that he\u2019d impose on my parents.", "created_utc": 1685369932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uw7b9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_boyfriends/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's your bf's daughter. DO NOT TAKE THIS CHILD ANYWHERE WITHOUT ONE OF HER PARENTS!!!\n\nYou are neither a parent or guardian. If you take her without her mother's consent and with her father not present, what's to stop the mother from claiming it's kidnapping?", "INFO: I don't get what Jack his plan was/is? The way I read it Jack also expects your parents to stay hours longer then they have planned to and Cece would still have more travel time then time to spend with Jack. Sounds like a pretty big sacrifice from your parents and Cece to make to benefit Jack.\n\nAlso, he didn't consult any of this with Cece's mother and/or Cece herself? He assumed you would do that or what?", "NTA\n\nIt isn't okay of blaming you when you didn't want to fight to have responsibility over his kid because your BF came up with some last-minute idea of spend more time with her.  And, honestly, his response and treatment of you is a huge red flag.", "NTA. That's one way to get charged with kidnapping. Do not do this.", "NTA. Personally, I\u2019m all for being kind to step-relatives, but he\u2019s asking this of you, in the middle of your trip, and acting like your and your family\u2019s discomfort makes you bad people. You were right not to say yes if you weren\u2019t 100% comfortable. Try to reason with him, hopefully he\u2019ll get it. I\u2019m not sure how applicable this is, but maybe you could suggest a way for all of you to spend time together at a different time.\n\nAlso, side note. The ex doesn\u2019t seem too involved in this story, but you seem very wary of her. Is there a reason? Are you once bitten, twice shy? Just curious.", "NTA. Cece is NOT your stepdaughter and your bf has one heck of nerve trying to manipulate not only you but your family to do what he and his child\u2019s mother should be doing.", "NTA. She's not your stepdaughter. You and Jack aren't married. Cece's mom would be entirely reasonable not to want to leave her daughter in the care of someone she doesn't know very well. You're probably a wonderful person, and Cece's mom probably has some unfounded prejudices against you, but even if she was judging you fairly, it's a lot to ask to trust someone other than a child's parent to travel a long distance away with them.", "So this man, who fathered a child at 17 and left her mother when the child was 3, is expecting you to do the awkward work of parenting.  Hmmmmmmmm.\n\nI think you are absolutely right to say no.  If you were on \\*excellent\\* terms with her mother, it might be worth offering.  \n\nCan't say I think much of your attitude towards Cece or her mother, but I don't think that in this situation you are the unreasonable one.\n\nNTA", "NTA Time to dump Jack", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would be a horrible idea to take Cece anywhere without both parents' express permission. If you don't have that, no dice.", "YTA, sorta. I understand being concerned about your stepdaughter's and parent's well-being, but it sounds like you built up a case in your head against her coming but didn't express it? Based on his response, it sounds like you didn't really point out your concerns to him. He probably would've understood.", "YTA, whoever your husband sires IS your child and your responsibility to raise", "NTA. Don\u2019t do this without Cece\u2019s mother knowing and sincerely agreeing to it. She has legal rights, you don\u2019t. Since she\u2019s hostile, you can\u2019t trust her to truly agree to it and have consistent good will towards you. You need to protect yourself.\n\nAlso, you would be putting responsibility for Cece on your parents during the drive back. That would be unacceptable for me.\n\nJack is trying to use you for his purposes. He may just be clueless about the trouble he is putting you into, but he shouldn\u2019t pressure you when you say no. I don\u2019t trust him.", "Thank you. I asked him if a parent was going along and he said no? My parents and sisters are meek people and I really don\u2019t want any trouble.", "Also, what if there\u2019s an accident and Cece gets injured? Her mom would definitely hold OP responsible and maybe try to press charges.", "I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s currently \u201ctrying\u201d to negotiate with her mom but I highly doubt she\u2019ll let her daughter ride for 8hrs with a family she doesn\u2019t know well.", "His ex is a very angry woman. Though sometimes she\u2019s justified in her anger, she has a tendency to lash out and use her daughter as leverage to fight against him. I\u2019ve heard them scream over the phone, then afterward Cece will text him calling him a horrible dad for yelling at her mom. She\u2019s been extremely civil towards me and refuses my offers to be friendly.", "Yea my BOYFRIEND has two cats too and I do raise them, you\u2019re absolutely right \ud83d\ude4f", "Well this is a terrible take.", "NTA. I agree with the above. If you know for sure that the child's mother would not approve of you taking her, that's an end to it. Maybe tell your partner to ask her first and get her express permission. If he doesn't want to do that, there's his answer.", "I mean, honestly, this is pretty reasonable when you think about it. Seems like it's only Jack who finds this arrangement agreeable. And no one who is actually directly involved does.", "From what he has just asked you, it is clear your boyfriend is not a responsible father. This and the fact she is civil with you make me think she is always justified in her anger, not just sometimes... I think your boyfriend is trying to dump his responsabilities as a father on you (now he can't do it on her). At minimum, you should show him that it won't happen.", "call it what you want, dating for 5 years = husband, it won't change because you are afraid of commitment", "I must have blacked out during our wedding \ud83d\ude33 I clearly don\u2019t make the rules, I should\u2019ve consulted you first \ud83d\ude14", "Lol agreed, 5 years of dating does not equal married. \u201cYou\u2019re responsibility to raise\u201d, uh no? This isn\u2019t even about if you care for Cece, that person doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA\n\nFirst, your boyfriend is so uninvolved in his child's life that he didn't even know she'd be in Cali. Then, when he does find out, he expects to inconvenience multiple people with a plan that doesn't even seem feasible. Aside from the mother's obvious discomfort with this whole idea, he thinks it's no big deal to force his daughter to do an 8 hr car ride so he can MAYBE see her for a few minutes? If he wanted to see her so badly, he can drive the 4 hrs to wherever she is, and then drive back for work. He sounds so selfish!", "NTA.  DO NOT TAKE THIS GIRL WITH YOU!!!!  No, no, no.  Unless you have actual, legal documents in hand, signed by all involved parties, notarized, & approved by the court, giving you temporary guardianship plus a release for any & all medical treatment in case of illness or accident, you should never be driving this child anywhere.  You and your family could be charged with kidnapping & the Feds would be involved because you are going to be crossing state lines.  This isn't a trip across town from mom's house to dad's house.  Stand firm OP, you do NOT want to do this, no way.", "NTA", "NTA.  You are not the girl's legal guardian or legal step parent.  The legal consequences, if something happens,  are on you and your parents.  \n\nYou also have a her word against your word situation if Cece decides to make trouble.", "NTA Also? RUN", "I would fully understand that because in this situation that's probably just acting in the best interest of her daughter. The way Jack tries to arrange stuff is kind of a minefield and mostly in his best interest. I think it's pretty healthy not wanting your 13 yo daughter to step into that (if she wanted to, which i highly doubt at her age).\n\nAnd it is also not reasonable to ask you to ask your family to stay over way more hours then they planned to stay. That's only reasonable if they would really like and can easily stay a little longer. If not, that's a huge offer (maybe someone is short on PTO too and has no time for it because they have get to get back to work).\n\nWhere I still completely ignore the point that your family are pretty much strangers to Cece and her mother. That just proves the whole point even more.", "NTA for this situation, you\u2019re making the right call, but how can you be with someone for *5 years* and not be more involved in their child\u2019s life?  Does he have very limited contact with Cece?", "He\u2019s lazy and trying to piggyback on your travel so it benefits him and he doesn\u2019t have to make an effort with his daughter. Why do you want to be with a man who cares so little about his own child? He didn\u2019t even know where she was. Jack sounds like an awful parent.", "When he said you are her stepmother you should say :\"oh really? Where is my ring?\" You are not her stepmother and if you dont feel like you wanna do it you dont have to do it! NTA"]}
