We often like to go on coffee dates or outings once a month or so. I usually bring my three year old daughter with me on coffee dates. She is pretty well behaved as far as three year year olds go. My friend (29F) has a bf but is unmarried and has no children. \n\n  My friend has recently started saying that she likes my daughter, but she preferred when we would hang out just the two of us. She says she has been patient but she is upset that we have only hung out one-on-one once in the past three years. Every other time, I have brought my daughter. For context, I've not even been on a one-on-one date with my own husband for over a year. So I don't think it's fair for her to expect me to give her more alone time than I even give my own spouse. \n\n  Anyways, my friend got upset with me about this issue yesterday. I think she was more sad than angry. She has mentioned this issue to me a few times before but yesterday I think she had the last straw. \n\n  What triggered it: her and I agreed to meet for coffee at 2:30. My mom calls me at 2:15 to let me know they are going camping at 4pm and I'm welcome to join (my mom is very fun and spontaneous. It can be a little hectic at times but she is a fun grandma). I say I'm busy going out with my friend. She says she really really wants my daughter to come, so she will pick up my daughter and take her while I stay in town for the day. \n\n  My friend and I only agreed to meet for coffee that day, but my friend suggests I come to her house for the rest of the day since my mom is taking my daughter. I don't really like that idea so I let her know I'll think about it. \n\n  The three of us have coffee and a good time. My mom calls me at 3:45 to let me know she'll pick up my daughter, but she'd really appreciate if I also came. My mom then tells me they were planning to go overnight, not just the day like originally. I didn't realize they were going overnight with my daughter, and if that's the case, I'd rather go along since I don't want her camping overnight without me.\n\n  I explain to my friend the situation, that I don't want her going overnight with just my mom and dad.\n\n  Later on, she texts me saying she has been extremely patient for us to have one-on-one girl time. She says she tries to be understanding, but this time I had the opportunity to go to her place without my daughter and I didn't take it. My friend said I could have easily just left my daughter with her grandparents. She also said she doesn't understand how I don't go crazy always hanging out with my kid.  She explained that she even gets sick of her niece from time to time, and she doesn't understand me. I felt like this is rude to say, because I do need some alone time, but I've never been bothered by taking my daughter. It is my friend who doesn't want her there, not me.\n\nEdit: I feel like some people are interpreting this as my friend has been saying she wants one-on-one time for years and I've been ignoring her. She's only said it in passing a few times, and has only really been emphasizing it recently. She's only really been focusing on it since the last time we hung out one on one (like a month ago). So it's not like she's been saying this for years, like some people seem to be thinking.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of people have been saying I don't give my daughter enough time with her grandparents. I want to clarify that she sees her grandparents about three times a week. She has had sleepovers with them before, but never gone camping overnight with them before.", "created_utc": 1689910169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155c4b8/aita_for_always_bringing_my_daughter_on_coffee/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What an exhausting read. Stop bringing your kid to coffee dates with your friend. It's weird and rude; she clearly wants adult time and your kid has plenty of caretakers. And go on a date with your husband.\n\nIs this possibly a dependency issue?", "YTA.\n\nStop wasting this woman's time. If she wants 1-on-1 time or adult hang out but you can't accommodate,  bow out. That way she can go spend that time hanging out with someone else or do something more enjoyable than spending time with someone who is not really there with her.\n\nAlso, if you are going to keep on doing this, please don't write a post a few years later lamenting how you don't have friends or how your friends are leaving you out of hang outs with other women.", "I\u2019m sorry, but YTA.  \n\nI\u2019m a parent too, but hanging alone with a friend versus hanging with a friend AND bringing your kid is a completely different experience. You are constantly distracted, censoring what you can say, and very aware a child is with you.  It\u2019s ok to bring a child sometimes (as long as your friend knows child is included in plans), but your friend has repeatedly requested one on one time, and to repeatedly ignore that and bring your child anyway isn\u2019t being a good friend.  \n\nYour defence that you also don\u2019t spend time alone with your spouse is messed up because that should also be a priority.  You can\u2019t defend being a kind of crappy friend by saying I\u2019m also not a great romantic partner.\n\nYou say in your post that you have parents in the picture that are good Grandparents that are willing to watch your child, so it would be a good idea to take advantage of that. Even more than being an AH to your friends and partner, using your child as a social crutch is being an AH to yourself.  It\u2019s important to have some degree of separation between you and your child, for both of you.  You need time apart to grow or maintain your own identities and for you to have a healthy (not codependent) bond.", "LOL it\u2019s crazy you and your husband don\u2019t even make time for yourselves to be alone together that\u2019s not healthy and your friend is also not in the wrong for wanting to just hangout the two of you", "A friend who has told you multiple times they were hurt that you deprioritized them and you left them mid-hang to go camping with your family?  YTA.", "In your edit you write\n\n>\u201dShe's only really been focusing on it since the last time we hung out one on one (like a month ago). So it's not like she's been saying this for years, like some people seem to be thinking.\u201d\n\nFirstly, if your kid came with last time you saw your friend (and it sounds like she did because you aren\u2019t willing to see your friend without bringing your daughter) that\u2019s not \u201cone on one.\u201d It suggests that you either don\u2019t understand what \u201cone on one means\u201d or that you don\u2019t see your child as a separate entity. Or maybe both. \n\nSecondly, you haven\u2019t seen her for a month and you left to go camping because you think\n>\u201da coffee date from 2:30-4 is pretty standard.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s 90 minutes, once a month and with your kid. That\u2019s barely putting in minimum effort. Did your friend know you don\u2019t think more than 90 minutes, once a month, is warranted? The way she reacted to you leaving to go camping suggests that she doesn\u2019t know how little time you\u2019re willing to spend with her. So not only does your friend have to censor what she says in front of your kid, you barely give her enough time to ever have a proper catch up or conversation. \n\nAs so many have pointed out to you, this level of attachment to your daughter just doesn\u2019t sound healthy. Your friend isn\u2019t being unreasonable by asking for some actual one on one time every once in a while, but you are unreasonable for refusing completely. \n\nIf I were your friend I would just let the relationship die, because your behaviour is frankly just insulting. It\u2019s all on your terms, which is grossly unfair. Your child isn\u2019t a newborn, she doesn\u2019t rely on you for nourishment, she has other family members she enjoys being with. That\u2019s another thing - your daughter would benefit from one on one time with other people too. You aren\u2019t setting up a healthy model for her to follow. \n\nOne day, sooner rather than later, you\u2019re going to wake up and realise that your selfishness and inconsiderate behaviour has left you friendless. If you\u2019re fine with that just keep going as you are. An inconsiderate friend is no friend. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. What if your friend wants to talk about something not child-friendly? You two can't even have an unfiltered conversation. She just wants to hang out with YOU, is that so hard?", "YTA, for all the reasons listed but also because you came to this forum for feedback and have a rebuttal to every commenter telling you that you\u2019re wrong. Accept the general consensus or don\u2019t ask for opinions.", "Your friend wants to hang with you 1 on 1.\r  \n\r  \nYou want to hang with her 1 on 1 + child.\r  \n\r  \nYour friend knows that's not the same.

She\u2019s not single then, is she?\n\nAlso, how is going camping ever not an overnight affair?", "YTA. It is incredibly sad and unhealthy.", "YTA.  Your friend wants adult time, but you insist on bringing your kid.  If you can't manage to function without your kid at your side, let the friendship go because she deserves better friends.", "YTA, you continue to ignore your friend's wishes and her needs! She wants alone-time with YOU! Maybe adult conversations but you keep bringing your daughter. Then you compare it with alone time with your husband? I haven't been out alone with my husband for over a year since we have no support from family (which you have) and babysitters are really exensive around here). But I was out with a friend just two days ago since that part is easy! My husband stayed home with the kids. If you're two parents it's ALWAYS easier to find alone-time for friends than with your partner.", "YTA your friend misses you and you\u2019ve been totally oblivious to her requests for alone time", "YTA. Your friend has expressed to you many times she misses hanging out w you. It seems like you have the means to be able to hang out w her without your child. Meeting for coffee is boring if that\u2019s all you do", "YTA and are very insensitive and rude to someone you say is a friend. Glad I don\u2019t have friends like you.", "YTA.  Not just to your friend but to your husband as well.  Look, I raised two kids.  And yes, kids should be a priority.  But you have options, namely what sounds like grandparents who would welcome time with their granddaughter.  One on one date time with your spouse is incredibly important to keep a marriage healthy\u2026something you\u2019re apparently neglecting.  A year?  Wowza!\n\nBut you\u2019ve also neglected your friend.  For 3 years.  Pretty much 3 years of no adult time with a friend.  No time to talk about adult things.  Sounds like everything you do centers around something a toddler can do.  \n\nComparing this to your husband is kind of a false equivalency.  You at least get some alone, and presumably adult, time after daughter goes to bed.  Of course your friend doesn\u2019t want her there all the time, every time.  If I was the friend, I\u2019d start to feel like I was a chore you were checking off your list.  \n\nYou made your life 100% about your child.  On the surface, this can seem like the right and proper thing to do.  However, it\u2019s all about balance.  If you don\u2019t nourish and maintain your adult relationships even as you\u2019re raising your children, you\u2019re going to wake up one day, 15+ years from now (when your children are adults leading their own lives) and realize the only thing you have is any empty nest and no one to help you fill the empty hours.", "YTA. She's not single if she has a boyfriend  - so is this a typo or do you think everyone who's not married (or hasn't kids) is single?", "You clearly have some issues when it comes to letting other people care for your daughter. Not strangers, but people who loves her, like your husband and your mother.\n\nQuestion: What did your mother do to you when you were a child, that was so horrible that she cant be trusted to take care of your daughter overnight?\n\nQuestion: How incompetent is your husband, that he cant be trusted to care for HIS OWN daughter for a few hours during the day?\n\nYour problems are stopping you from having a good relationship with both your husband and your friend. This will cause problems in both these, and probably also your future relationship with your daughter. She needs more in her life than just you. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Camping means overnight, so you using the excuse your mum changed plans last minute by wanting to take the kid overnight is a total cop-out.", "Slightly YTA. \n\n\nWanting to meet a friend and always carrying a kid with you.... Yes, I understand why you do it, but personally, I end up just not meeting friends who always bring their kid very often. Because sometimes, I want to spend time with my friend alone. It's heartbreaking you don't even find time for dates with your husband. Yikes.", "YTA\n\n1) You and your friend made plans, and if I understand correctly, you decided that you would spend some time at your friend's house after the coffee. Then, you ditched your friend just because your mother - who is known for her spontaneaus ideas and plans - figure out something else.\n2) You knew that your friend wanted to spend some 1 - on - 1 time with you, and when you had the opportunity, you decided to not take it.\n\nYou also could compromise. Maybe have a coffee, mom takes your daugther, you could still spend some time with your friend, then join your parents and daugther later.\n\nYour friend doesn't mad at you because you have a daughter and therefore limited free time.

You cannot always do that with a young child there.", "YTA, my BFF is a mum with 3 kids (10,6, and 2) 6 is in the process of being assessed for ADHD and is a handful (he's such a kind a sweet little boy though). I get overestimated very easily, so it can get a bit much sometimes. She also has a husband that works full time and on one of the 2 days he has off she is helping her brother with visitation to his kids (the only way the mum will agree to visitation is of BFF is there to supervise. He brought this on himself), so she doesn't get a lot of spare time. I would love more one on one time, but I have to wait for her to ask because she knows when I'm available but not always when she is. \n\nMy point is that she makes the effort! Our friendship is important enough for her to make time for me. I don't have to bring it up, but on the rare occasions I want a girls day I will check when she is free and if her hubby can have the kids (he picks up shifts occasionally, he's great with the kids! ), she's ALWAYS there.", "YTA I never take my kids with me unless prearranged. I have four and leave them at home.", "YTA", "It is really nicr to see a parent who wants to spend time with their kid!\n\nHowever, a wise womsn will also make sure to care for her friends' needs and wants .. or old age after kid moved out will be quite lonely...", "YTA. Hanging out with someone\u2019s kid there is not the same. You\u2019re used to it because the kid is yours. Your friend wanted adult conversation.

You should make some time for child-free socialising both with your husband and with your friend (and probably others).\n\nBy assuming (or taking the position) that an invitation to you is an invitation to you + daughter, you will find such invitations stop coming.\n\nYTA.", "Having a kid is hard. And our society is set up in a way that makes parents isolated so it's extra hard to have enough childcare. So I can't totally blame you for this situation because all parents have been set up to fail.\n\nBut friendships take work. Friendships should be just as important as family. In our world, for some reason, we only prioritize our immediate families. Once you get married and have a child, the attitude seems to be that friends can go f@$# themselves. Again, most parents don't have adequate time and resources for childcare, but it's also about prioritizing friendships too, when you can. You're not doing that. You're neglecting your friend. The fact that it didn't even occur to you that she'd want to hang out without your kid sometimes is troubling. YTA.", "Yta, yeah I get that balancing time when you have a kid is hard but sometimes you do need to use that free time on friends. It's why a lot of parents loss friends because they stop maintaining the friendship. You are neglecting your friendship with her because she doesnt want to hang out with your your kid. It doesnt matter that shes well behaved, no everyone is as enthusiastic about your kid as you. Hell you dont even have to spend every coffee date kid less but like maybe once a month with out the kid. Hey it's up to you but I can see the decline in the friendship, you probably wont lose her as a friend but the dynamic will change.", "YTA. Look after your mental health.

Nobody enjoys hanging around someone who is occupied with their kid. You probably only give your friend what ...10...15% of your attention when you hang out?

What's wrong with you that you can't take a couple hours once a month to be anything other than a slave to your kid?", "YTA. Listen. No friend wants to hang out with you *and* your spawn on girl-day dates. Never. Ever.", "Here's the thing: being a mother is not a hall pass from putting in an effort in your relationships. Your adult friends were your friends before your kid came along, and if you want them to continue being your friend, show them some respect and consideration.

Also, maybe, just maybe get a babysitter and have more alone time with your husband. \n\nSaying something in passing for a long time then pushing it 'recently' (which could be months) is someone trying to get you to pick up on something without screaming in your face about it. \n\nI wouldn't say you were the asshole exactly, it's your choice. But you need to keep in mind that your kid is interesting because it's your kid, to everyone else it's just a distraction and damn boring for any meeting of friends. They are your friend not your kids friend and they want to spend time with you, not you babysitting and distracted by your kid. That might not be logistically possible, but it's not wrong to want to hang out with just you and it seems like you had the opportunity to do so and turned it down and so she's hurt by that.\n\nThat you have been ignoring their requests and decided when given the chance and seeing how excited your friend was, to just take a pass makes you in the wrong here I would say.

Especially if you have people around who want to help out. You need to prioritise this more.\n\nAnd finally, the actual point of this, yes you\u2019re being a bad friend. I have friends with multiple young children and I understand when most of the time it needs to be child friendly. However we also do other kid-free things together so we can actually talk! Always bringing your child means you\u2019ll be focused on her and not be present with your friend. It cuts into the flow of conversation and means your minds is always half on something else. Your friend is justifiably upset with your behaviour. \n\nYou need to reevaluate how things are actually working and get a babysitter every now & then!!", "YTA I lost my best friend because she wouldn\u2019t do anything without at least 1 of her kids.

You have GOT to let someone else care for your child at some point. Your parents raised you, they can keep your child happy and alive for 24 hours.", "Friendships are important and if you want to keep them you need to nurture them. Your friend is probably a little unrealistic. You do have a child now and your life has forever changed but why can\u2019t you make time to see your friend one on one? Why can\u2019t you see her when your husband is home from work and can parent her and you go out? If you don\u2019t make some effort to meet your friend halfway you may lose her and good friends are worth keeping. \n\nESH more understanding is probably required on both sides.", "NAH. You're a mom, it's understandable. But your friend is not. Her friendship is with you, not with your child. She has expressed her needs to you multiple times. This is why mom's tend to lose their friendgroups. If you never prioritize your adult friends (while you child is taken care of of course), they'll find someone who does prioritize them. Does your husband never take over so you can have some free time? That's not fair to you or healthy for you.", "Okay, I am clearly not going to be in the majority, but ... NAH.  \n\n\nYour friend would like to hang out with just you. That's not her being TA - it is what it is. Hanging out with a friend-plus-the-friend's-child is a different experience from having one-on-one time.

That doesn't make you TA either. But it is worth noting that *your child is going on to have her own life* \\- kindergarten, school - and her own friends, and come that time, your child will not want to be spending 100% of her time with you, and so - you will have to go places and do things and connect with your husband and your friends anew.  And if you tried to hang on to your child and ensure your child didn't have time without you - well, at that point you would be TA.", "In this specific instance you mentioned, N-T-A , I think it\u2019s ok to not want your kid to be spending overnight with someone else. \n\nBut you asked whether YTA for always bringing your daughter, and I think the answer is yes. It sounds like you have people to look after her (husband, your parents) I can\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t let them look after her for an hour?", "NTA but you and your friend need to evaluate whether you can find a compromise so that both your needs are met. It sounds like her love language is quality time and you have rarely spoken in it to her since you became a mum. I personally don't mind hanging with my girlfriends and their kids in the same time (I dont have my own kids) - it's kind of natural that if one has children, they become the priority and are incorporated into your friendship; if I need more exclusive attention, I say it explicitly and I am accomodated. That said, not everyone will enjoy this kind of boundaries and you and your friend should find your own.", "NTA.  However, maybe there are topics your friend wants to discuss that are not that suitable for younger ears.  Also the dynamics of two people spending time together often gets to deeper, unexpected places.  Find a time for both.  There is also a 'Coffee over Zoom', which is great for informal chats without the need to travel etc.   You might want to explore why you don't trust your parents to take her camping?", "I think your friend needs more childless friends.", "NTA! Your friend isn't being understanding of you or your situation which is fair considering she doesn't have children herself, but still. I also wouldn't have been comfortable sending my 3 year old off camping overnight without me, so I don't blame you for not taking friend up on her often to hang out at her place and it's not fair of her to get pissy at you over that. Yeah it would be lovely to have one-on-one time with her, but that's very often easier said than done especially if you even struggle to manage that with your husband too.\n\nWhat I find many child-free people don't understand is how difficult it can be to find time to do ANYTHING  without your children when they are very little and also that alot of the time we like having our little people around and would actually prefer to not have to leave them behind.", "So many childless people here. That's reddit for you.\nYou clearly prioritize spending time (or being around) your kid. That is good. You also want to see your friend often, also good.\nHowever, said friend wants to have 1-on-1 time, and you kept dismissing this, rather obvious, request. Not good.\n\nCommunicate and make a decision both of you are comfortable with. A compromise is needed: perhaps you can have half of your meeting including your child, the other half 1-on-1.\n\nBut if nothing works, you just must have kid around, then one of you will have to sacrifice something. Either she drops the request, and accepts it will always be 2-on-1, or you accept that you may lose a good friend due to your inflexibility.\n\nEither way, NAH (soft E S H, for bad communication and conflict management).

We often like to go on coffee dates or outings once a month or so. I usually bring my three year old daughter with me on coffee dates. She is pretty well behaved as far as three year year olds go. My friend (29F) has a bf but is unmarried and has no children. \n\n  My friend has said that she likes my daughter, but she preferred when we would hang out just the two of us. She says she has been patient but she is upset that we have only hung out one-on-one once in the past three years. Every other time, I have brought my daughter. For context, I've not even been on a one-on-one date with my own husband for over a year. So I don't think it's fair for her to expect me to give her more alone time than I even give my own spouse. \n\n  Anyways, my friend got upset with me about this issue yesterday. I think she was more sad than angry. She has mentioned this issue to me a few times before but yesterday I think she had the last straw. \n\n  What triggered it: her and I agreed to meet for coffee at 2:30. My mom calls me at 2:15 to let me know they are going camping at 4pm and I'm welcome to join (my mom is very fun and spontaneous. It can be a little hectic at times but she is a fun grandma). I say I'm busy going out with my friend. She says she really really wants my daughter to come, so she will pick up my daughter and take her while I stay in town for the day. \n\n  My friend and I only agreed to meet for coffee that day, but my friend suggests I come to her house for the rest of the day since my mom is taking my daughter. I don't really like that idea so I let her know I'll think about it. \n\n  The three of us have coffee and a good time. My mom calls me at 3:45 to let me know she'll pick up my daughter, but she'd really appreciate if I also came. My mom then tells me they were planning to go overnight, not just the day like originally. I didn't realize they were going overnight with my daughter, and if that's the case, I'd rather go along since I don't want her camping overnight without me.\n\n  I explain to my friend the situation, that I don't want her going overnight with just my mom and dad.\n\n  Later on, she texts me saying she has been extremely patient for us to have one-on-one girl time. She says she tries to be understanding, but this time I had the opportunity to go to her place without my daughter and I didn't take it. My friend said I could have easily just left my daughter with her grandparents. She also said she doesn't understand how I don't go crazy always hanging out with my kid.  She explained that she even gets sick of her niece from time to time, and she doesn't understand me. I felt like this is rude to say, because I do need some alone time, but I've never been bothered by taking my daughter. It is my friend who doesn't want her there, not me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Before I had a kid I was always happy if my friends had to bring their kids along for our meet ups; but this wasn't every time. I get why your friend is feeling this way.\nI think child free time is valuable for you. As a mum now, I find it hard to leave my kid sometimes, but it does me good to get 'me time '.\nIs everything okay OP? I wonder if there's a bit more to why you can't leave your child? It may be worth speaking to someone and sharing any concerns you might have. I say this as someone close to me had undiagnosed postnatal depression and still struggles with anxiety.

You're allowed and should want to have some time away from her to keep nurturing your relationships and spend some quality time with your friend(s) and your husband. \nWe're all telling you YTA and you keep making excuses or say that we don't understand. We understand just fine but, if you don't understand our point and the point your friend is making, you should probably talk to a therapist before you become an insufferable helicopter parent.", "YTA your friend is reaching out and telling you how they feel, and you continue to ignore that, and not prioritize the friendship. Instead of arguing with her and everyone posting here, why can\u2019t you say \u201cOK, I will leave daughter with husband/grandma for the day\u201d and then actually go spend time with your friend, one on one. It sounds like maybe she needs to talk or is having a problem or just wants time without a three year old.", "YTA. For not spending time alone with your friend. But also for not spending alone time with your husband.", "I genuinely hate to say this but YTA.\n\nI hate to say it because I\u2019m a mom too. I have two toddlers and I\u2019m pregnant with my 3rd. I know it can be hard to do things with friends who don\u2019t have children. BUT. You definitely need to think outside of the box if you value this friendship. \n\nHere is how my husband and I handle similar situations. \n\n1) one of us will watch our boys so the other can spend some child free time with friends. You both need some time away from your children for your mental health and to just be an adult. Even if that means one of you is the \u201cbabysitter\u201d for a day once a month. Or even once every 2 months. \n\n2) get creative with date nights for you and your husband. One time we left our kids with my mom for an couple hours and just sat in a nearby Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot and watched a TV show on a tablet while we ate breakfast. A little lame? Yeah. But one of our favorite dates. If you have no one to take the kids, plan something specific for after they go to sleep. One time we made brownies together for brownie sundaes and just sat on the couch and played video games together. Stayed up super late. We were both exhausted the next day but it was worth it. \n\n3) plan ahead. See if someone can watch your daughter on a specific date a couple weeks out and then plan to either go out with your friend or your husband. Or ask your friend to give you a few dates she\u2019s free and plan around one of those. \n\nWhen it comes to your friend, I know this might feel a bit unfair. It\u2019s neither of your faults that you and your friend are in very different places in life now. But fair or not, the burden is more on you. Your friend can\u2019t really understand motherhood just because she has a niece. Unless she\u2019s that child\u2019s guardian, she doesn\u2019t know what that feels like. You on the other hand, know what it was to be child free AND you know what it\u2019s like to be a mom. \n\nWhen I\u2019m dealing with my child free friends, I always assume that they don\u2019t want my kids around unless they specifically ask for them to be there (which has happened). Even when my kids are invited, husband and I will still make a judgement call about whether or not it\u2019s something we think makes sense. An engagement party with mostly adults? Not a good idea. Our friend\u2019s backyard barbecues? That\u2019s fine. \n\nIf we genuinely can\u2019t find childcare, only one of us might go. Or I\u2019ll give the person the heads up: \u201c I have no one to watch my kids. Do you want to reschedule because otherwise I\u2019d have to bring them?\u201d Sometimes the answer is nah, bring them anyway. Sometimes they take me up on picking a rain date. It\u2019s down to the parent to be the more accommodating one. We love our kids but no one else has to. And sometimes hanging with a person who is attending to their kid is annoying in the way someone constantly being on their phone is annoying. You\u2019re distracted and your friend wants your attention.", "NTA. You choose how you live your life. \n\nBut you have to be aware that every action has consequences.\n\nThe consequence is that you will lose your friendship. \n\nAnd you also provide no independence time to your child.

I perhaps should clarify that we get alone time, but we usually don't go on formal dates. \n\nSo we will spend time together just us watching a movie at home, or just catching up on stuff while grandma and grandpa babysits. But we haven't gone out to a restaurant or anything formal as a date for a while.\n\nI don't think my daughter has a codependent bond, as she spends tons of time with her dad, grandparents, auntie, and cousins. We visit my parents at least three times a week, so she likely gets more attention from non-parental figures than usual.", "We do make time to be together, but not necessarily in the context of a \"date\".

We also get my parents to babysit while we hang out together in the house, catching up on chores while chatting and taking cuddle breaks. \n\nBut unfortunately, we have not had a lot of time for formal dates.

I think a coffee date from 2:30-4 is pretty standard.", "The previous time we hung out, my daughter was at home with her dad, so it was one-on-one. \n\nShe spends time with her grandparents three times a week or more, so she is often with other adults.", "When I first started reading this, I assumed that she was a financially strapped single mother who could not get away from the kid.
