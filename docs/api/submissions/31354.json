My family have been helping them out financially and to adjust to life outside Asia etc. \n\nMay struggled to find friends and so my mom gave her an open invitation to come over for lunch. May texts my mom when she wants to come over, and stays from the morning to the evening. The problem is my parents expect my brother (18M) and I (21F) to \u201centertain\u201d her while they run errands because she\u2019s our age. \n\nUsually my brother and I have no problem just hanging out with someone for a bit. However her conversation with May can get awkward as I\u2019m fairly certain she remembers that she used to bully me about my body when we were 14/15. I don\u2019t blame her as kids say stupid things but I keep my distance. My brother doesn\u2019t like her as she hits him with passive aggressive comments like: *\u201cinternational students work harder than locals, so I don\u2019t know why you have a job and I don\u2019t\u201d*. May never acts like this infront of our parents.\n\nThe issue that I\u2019d like other people\u2019s perspective on is that my mom has now invited her over to come in the morning and stay the night at our house for all of our Christmas events, Christmas Day at our house, *and* our family holiday in Jan. \n\nThis annoyed me for two reasons:\n1. Her invitation contradicts the rule that my brother and I were not allowed sleepovers, or people over on weekends or holidays as it was \u201cfamily time\u201d and my parents wanted to be \u201cfree in their own house\u201d \n2. My mom knows that inviting her over for long periods of time will impact my brother and I who have to \u201clook after\u201d her, but she did not let us know before asking her \n\nI\u2019ve asked her about it and provided the above reasons, but she said she\u2019s the parent and we\u2019re the children therefore she can invite whoever she wants, and that May is not a \u201cbaby\u201d and doesn\u2019t need looking after- but we need to be good hosts and \u201chost\u201d her when she\u2019s here. \n\nThe conflict happened when I filled my time for when May is supposed to be at ours by organising things with friends, nail appointments etc. and simply letting my mom know it was happening. \n\nI also told her why I wasn\u2019t too keen on May (I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell her as a kid, I think I was ashamed) and she told me that I was being a terrible person by punishing her for something that happened so long ago, and I needed to be a good host and stay home. She\u2019s been ignoring me for the last week and I really want to know if I\u2019m TA here?", "created_utc": 1700493757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zqwif/aita_for_avoiding_being_home_when_we_have_people/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are both adults and can do as you please. Get a room each or rent an Air BNB\n\nJust disappear from Christmas Eve till the day after Boxing day", "Info: So have you told your mom about the way she behaves differently when the parents aren't around and how that impacts you + your brother?\n\nRegardless, feels fucked up that you told your mom this person bullied you as a kid and your mom didn't even offer comfort in learning her child had been hurting...", "NTA. You are adults and can choode to spend your time as you please. Tell your mum that you are not the host, but she is, as she has invited her and therefore should be a 'good host' to her", "NTA your mother is entitled to have guests over, but SHE'S the host, not you, and you will undoubtedly be polite, you should make plans on your own. You should be able to enjoy your holidays as well. Hold your ground and your boundaries.", "Just leave when May comes over. NTA.", "Yeah no, NTA. May used to bully you, and makes snide comments at your little brother for seemingly no reason. I suggest though that you meet May somewhere public and have a calm conversation with her about how her comments make you feel, and that you don't feel comfortable with having to \"entertain her\" according to your parents. Maybe that can spark a conversation between your folks and May about how she gets invited over but ignored by them to a degree once she arrives. But I honestly don't blame you for getting out of the house when May visits, because it's emotionally exhausting to have to entertain a guest that isn't even yours", "No, NTA.\n\nSo, I would talk to your mom (though it sounds like you have) regarding May's behavior (especially the current behavior) and how you feel.  If nothing changes, then the only thing that can change is you.  It seems like the least bad option to just not be at home as much as possible.  I would also tell her that her \"family\" rules at Christmas bother you, because YOU are uncomfortable around May, the way that she would be around one of your friends.  I know, it is your parent's home and you can't control her behavior, and as a parent, I get that.  But I, as a parent, would want to understand how my child is feeling, and also want to make them as comfortable as possible.  If nothing changes, then just keep avoiding May as often as you can.", "nta. it's unfair for your parents to expect you and your brother to entertain someone who bullied you and makes passive-aggressive comments. your mom's double standard and disregard for your feelings are not okay. you have the right to prioritize your own well-being and spend time with friends.", "NTA. To say it quite bluntly: Your mother invited May. Let your mother host her. You seem to have nothing in common with her and you bear a grudge towards her from earlier. Naturally you don't want to hang out with her for days on end.", "NTA. I\u2019d record her when your parents are out so they can see what she\u2019s really like.", "NTA.  She needs to learn..... you can't treat people badly then expect them to embrace you.\n\nThat is life. \n\nTell Mom to entertain her.", "NTA.\n\nMay is an adult presumably. Your schedule shouldn't need to hinge on her being there. Your mother opened her home to these students, so it's on her to 'host' them. However, hosting them doesn't mean that anyone needs to sit front and center with them every single moment of every day.\n\nDon't have any further conversations with your mother about your plans. Just do them. You're an adult, so what is she going to do if you're just not there and doing your own thing? She'll be upset perhaps, but this is a situation of her own making.", "NTA\n\nMay has never apologised to you, I'm guessing, and clearly hasn't presented that she has become any different a person than who she was when she was bullying you. You don't owe her a thing.\n\nYour mom is right, in that she is free to invite over whomever she wants, but you also did the right thing by filling up your schedule out of the house. Your mom can't task you with hosting her guests - if she wants to invite people over, she can host them properly, herself.", "NTA, you go hang out with your friends as often as you can and let your parents entertain THEIR guest over the holidays... it's not your responsibility", "Seriously? You're still clinging to some petty grudge from high school like it's your life's purpose. Instead of being an adult, you opt for the passive-aggressive route, organizing your own escape during May's visit. How about you grow up and realize that people change? Your mom is trying to create a welcoming atmosphere, and you're just spreading toxicity with your self-centered attitude. It's time to shed that victim mentality and start acting like a decent human being. You're being a toxic individual, and it's high time for some serious self-reflection.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm thinking there's some sense of obligation between your mom and May's mom.\n\nYou're an adult, you should be allowed to have your own life, and May is also an adult, she shouldn't need a sitter. Especially when she's rude.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA if your mother wants someone to entertain this person, she can do it herself. I never liked the too-common practice of parents just pushing people of similar ages together and saying \u201cnow go and interact\u201d as if all that it takes for people to connect is a similarity on age. \n\nNext time this visitor says something rude, just call her out on it. Tell her that you\u2019ve been generous enough until now in babysitting her and tolerating her unpleasant self. Also point out that it\u2019s obvious why she can\u2019t make friends.", "NTA - you are 21 years old. Live your life.

If you really can\u2019t get out of this any other way, tell your Mom that May confided in you she wants to accept Christ into her heart and be saved, but she\u2019s intimidated to say anything directly.

We have a spare bedroom for her, but what I meant by \u201chost\u201d is that we are expected to sit and chat/entertain her for the entire span of time she\u2019s here.
