May texts my mom when she wants to come over, and stays from the morning to the evening. The problem is my parents expect my brother (18M) and I (21F) to \u201centertain\u201d her while they run errands because she\u2019s our age. \n\nUsually my brother and I have no problem just hanging out with someone for a bit.

I don\u2019t blame her as kids say stupid things but I keep my distance. My brother doesn\u2019t like her as she hits him with passive aggressive comments like: *\u201cinternational students work harder than locals, so I don\u2019t know why you have a job and I don\u2019t\u201d*.

Her invitation contradicts the rule that my brother and I were not allowed sleepovers, or people over on weekends or holidays as it was \u201cfamily time\u201d and my parents wanted to be \u201cfree in their own house\u201d \n2.

You are adults and can choode to spend your time as you please. Tell your mum that you are not the host, but she is, as she has invited her and therefore should be a 'good host' to her", "NTA your mother is entitled to have guests over, but SHE'S the host, not you, and you will undoubtedly be polite, you should make plans on your own. You should be able to enjoy your holidays as well. Hold your ground and your boundaries.", "Just leave when May comes over. NTA.", "Yeah no, NTA. May used to bully you, and makes snide comments at your little brother for seemingly no reason. I suggest though that you meet May somewhere public and have a calm conversation with her about how her comments make you feel, and that you don't feel comfortable with having to \"entertain her\" according to your parents. Maybe that can spark a conversation between your folks and May about how she gets invited over but ignored by them to a degree once she arrives. But I honestly don't blame you for getting out of the house when May visits, because it's emotionally exhausting to have to entertain a guest that isn't even yours", "No, NTA.\n\nSo, I would talk to your mom (though it sounds like you have) regarding May's behavior (especially the current behavior) and how you feel.  If nothing changes, then the only thing that can change is you.  It seems like the least bad option to just not be at home as much as possible.  I would also tell her that her \"family\" rules at Christmas bother you, because YOU are uncomfortable around May, the way that she would be around one of your friends.  I know, it is your parent's home and you can't control her behavior, and as a parent, I get that.  But I, as a parent, would want to understand how my child is feeling, and also want to make them as comfortable as possible.  If nothing changes, then just keep avoiding May as often as you can.", "nta. it's unfair for your parents to expect you and your brother to entertain someone who bullied you and makes passive-aggressive comments. your mom's double standard and disregard for your feelings are not okay. you have the right to prioritize your own well-being and spend time with friends.", "NTA. To say it quite bluntly: Your mother invited May. Let your mother host her. You seem to have nothing in common with her and you bear a grudge towards her from earlier.

However, hosting them doesn't mean that anyone needs to sit front and center with them every single moment of every day.\n\nDon't have any further conversations with your mother about your plans. Just do them. You're an adult, so what is she going to do if you're just not there and doing your own thing? She'll be upset perhaps, but this is a situation of her own making.", "NTA\n\nMay has never apologised to you, I'm guessing, and clearly hasn't presented that she has become any different a person than who she was when she was bullying you. You don't owe her a thing.\n\nYour mom is right, in that she is free to invite over whomever she wants, but you also did the right thing by filling up your schedule out of the house. Your mom can't task you with hosting her guests - if she wants to invite people over, she can host them properly, herself.", "NTA, you go hang out with your friends as often as you can and let your parents entertain THEIR guest over the holidays... it's not your responsibility", "Seriously? You're still clinging to some petty grudge from high school like it's your life's purpose. Instead of being an adult, you opt for the passive-aggressive route, organizing your own escape during May's visit. How about you grow up and realize that people change? Your mom is trying to create a welcoming atmosphere, and you're just spreading toxicity with your self-centered attitude. It's time to shed that victim mentality and start acting like a decent human being. You're being a toxic individual, and it's high time for some serious self-reflection.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I envy your freedom.\n\nI have a family member who is a serial overstayer.  If ever they visit, I obviously cannot be rude.  There's a catch-up chat.  Beverages and food are offered.  Family news and mutual acquaintances are discussed.  There's some reminiscing done.  How much more could anyone expect?  But this serial overstayer just never gives an indication of leaving.  Even when the conversation starts to run dry.  I can't understand how they don't want to leave at that point.\n\nNow, there is an added twist to the scenario.  Serial overstay has decided to have a \"vanlife\" experience.
