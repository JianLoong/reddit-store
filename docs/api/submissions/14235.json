My last sentence on this post was harsh as hell and I understand where some of you coming from with calling me out on it and I do appreciate it. I said that out of anger.\n\n2.) I am NOT trying to stop dad's happiness by any means. It was a shock and I literally told him that I just needed time but for some reason I'm being told I'm trying to stop his happiness. I need you all to understand that I would never want him to stay miserable but to understand that if he would communicated correctly and been understandable I would have been fine with this whole marriage. \n\n3.)

Other than this, he isn\u2019t TA", "NAH.  You are okay in feeling hurt that your father has moved on so quickly.  I've also seen times when it took years for a parent to move on and find a partner and the kids were just as bent out of shape regardless of how much time had passed, it was never enough.  I don't think there is a right answer here.\n\nTypically, men do move on rather quickly as many of them have a tough time being alone.  They do often find spouses who also are widowed and its a common bound that brings them together faster too.  I had one friend that said you don't realize how bad it is until you go through it yourself (losing a long term spouse) and that's why they often find one another like this, especially thru grief counseling groups.\n\nYou don't have to accept the marriage, but you risk a rocky relationship with your dad as a result.", "No one's an asshole here\n\nI'm sorry for your loss but are you expecting him to not move on until you are ready?

If it means being rude to her or insinuating that their relationship is fake then you would be the asshole. If it means that you just think negative thoughts about their marriage (but never verbalize them) then you are not the asshole.\n\nYou don't have to love her, but you do have to be respectful and nice to her.\n\nEither way, I would highly recommend looking into therapy--that's a lot of complicated stuff to untangle and work out.", "NAH, but all feelings aside... there's nothing here for you to 'accept'. It's a done deal. Now it's up to you to decide to take space and how much you want to interact. You are not obligated to love her, OP. You are obligated to be mature enough not to refer to them as 'lonely ass people' because frankly, you have NO idea what your dad or his wife have gone through/going through. Statistically, men tend to remarry rather quickly after the death of a wife; your father is still a person who desires companionship, and it sounds like the woman he chose is a good person. I'd urge you to talk to a therapist, because the death of your mother is a very tragic loss and you need to process this, if only in order not to hold resentment against two other people who are also doing the best they know how to do, just like you.", "NTA. Cause you can accept or not accept whatever you want. That\u2019s your own life decision.\n\nBut try to look at it from an unbiased perspective.\n\nYour dads hurt. And when you\u2019re hurt, all you want is to not hurt. And his own daughter refuses to let him move on. How do you think that makes him feel? How long does he need to hurt for you to not resent him for trying to move on?\n\nAnd all a relationship is is two lonely people trying to find comfort in this fucked up world. It\u2019s finding that partner who you can spend a Tuesday night with smiling and laughing. And if they\u2019ve got that, why can\u2019t you be happy for him?", "NAH- guess what, they might be two lonely people wanting company and that is FINE. There are many forms of love, they might love each other more like friends then how he loved your mom.\n\nYou are not required to love his wife, all one can ask is that you treat her with respect and be polite to her. She is not your mom and wont ever be your mom. Be honest with her, say you think she is a nice person. \n\nStop fighting this so hard too, life goes on, it sucks when a parent dies. But people are people and they do what they can to stop the world from being a hard place to live, for your Dad that meant finding someone else.", "YTA for being controlling.  Let your dad live, and stop trying to assume you fully understand everything going on with him.  You said the grieving process is hard for you, but how has it been for him?\n\nBut there also seems to be some weird dynamic going on.  How could he have \"forced\" you to meet her when you were at least 21 at the time?  YOU made that choice, whether or not you know it -- so you claimed he was controlling you when he had no way to do that, and now you are trying to control him.", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s not fair that he should have to wait for your permission to move on, whether you like it or not. It\u2019s his life, and it doesn\u2019t really matter whether or not you approve of him getting engaged and it is therefore not your place to tell him he is in the wrong for it. \n\nThis, however, does not permit him to try and force you to like her and meet her. He needs to recognize that it is not OK to assume that someone else is over grieving just because you are and OP does not owe it to her father to meet his fianc\u00e9 and like her.", "I am sorry for your loss, but honestly, ESH \n\nYour Dad's grieving process is his process, not yours. And maybe it was/is driven by fear of being alone, but that's a genuine fear for some people. Did he rush the decision to date/propose/get married? Maybe. But 4-ish years on, it's starting to look like this is a genuine relationship. There's also something to be said for the anger that he seems to be holding onto, and he likely ought to address that in therapy, but that's on him, not you. \n\nHe seems like an AH for how he interacts with you and your siblings, but I think you're starting to cross the line due to judging him and his motives. Ask yourself this: since you think he moved too quickly, how long *should* he have waited before dating?\n\nNot for nothing, but you don't have to *love* your dad's new wife. If she's nice and helpful as you say, great. But she's not going to replace your mother for you, and that's okay.", "ESH. \n\nFirst off you don't have to love her. So toss that out. You're 25 you're likely never going to see her as a mother figure. You are past that age. You can however respect her and be kind to her since she is nice and you don't seem to have a problem with her as a person. \n\nYou're dad is hurting too and has the right to move on. I can get how your heart might not be ok with that but your brain has to. The way he acted tho makes him a huge AH too. Forcing you to meet before you were ready was a big mistake. Cussing at you? He's the biggest AH here no doubt. \n\nI could probably go n-t-a but I dont think you get a pass for not understanding your father was hurting too, and that he doesn't have to follow the same path you do with grieving and can move on with his love life if he wants.", "YTA\n\nSo much. Your grief doesn't give you the right to control your father's happiness.", "NTA. Your dad is entitled to have his relationships, but forcing her in your lives despite your protests such a short while after your mother died is cruel. When my father died I cried every day for a year, I couldn\u2019t imagine my mother saying \u201chey btw I\u2019m dating someone and he WILL be in your life.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine any parent who\u2019s worth a damn doing that. That\u2019s an act of pure selfishness and cruelty. Getting angry with you for not wanting to meet her is him essentially giving you no choice. Either you deal with her or lose BOTH of your parents. How dare he. \n\nSorry OP, you have every right to not accept this marriage. He should have and could have gone about this an entirely different way that didn\u2019t essentially traumatize you.", "NTA but your dad sure sounds like one. You\u2019re probably right about him not being able to be alone. My mom died in 2011 and her husband remarried quickly. I call him \u201cher husband\u201d because that\u2019s who he is to me now, nothing more. He made it clear that me nor my feelings mattered so I decided to cut him out of my life permanently. Best decision I ever made. My mom has been gone for a long time and I still grieve her, some days are harder than others but it all kinda sucks without her here. But anyway, you\u2019re not a bad person for not liking this new woman, you\u2019re not obligated to regardless of how your dad makes you feel. You\u2019re 25, it\u2019s time to start making choices that better your life and your circumstances, and maybe going LC or NC until your dad can learn to respect you and your wishes/decisions is what you need now. You certainly don\u2019t need to be feeling bad over not liking the woman he chose to replace your mom. And it does sound like he is trying to replace her, if not why would he force her on you? It should have always been your choice to meet her, the fact he didn\u2019t respect your wishes to not meet her is a big old red flag in that relationship.", "NTA. I recently read a statistic that the vast majority of men will be remarried within two years of being widowed or divorced. And a small minority of women. I think you're probably pretty accurate in thinking that he got married because he was lonely and it was too hard to grieve for your mom alone. I don't think your dad's new wife is an AH, it sounds like she's kind and doing the best she can. But your dad shouldn't treat you poorly just because you don't love someone you've only known for a short time, who entered your life when you were probably at your lowest. *That's* the AH move here.", "NTA\n\nHe moved on very quickly.", "You're 25y wth not loving your father's wife is even a problem? You're old enough to say to your father to go f*** himself and to say to his new wife that she's a nice person but that her relationship with your father is shade af.\n\nPS: I don't think she's nice at all... she's completely ok with your father awful behavior. Yes, he has every right to have a new relationship but the dates are to strange ... 6m after your mother death you find out about them dating, but when they started? Before or after your mother passed? And the date of their engagement? This sounds more like she's faking her \"nice person\" attitude and you're buying it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI personally think the father was being an A-H in pushing you to meet his new wife; he\u2019s also a gentle A-H if he\u2019s forcing you to have a relationship with her. \n\nYou have your own timeline for grieving, and he has his. As long as you\u2019re not being malicious to either of them for moving on, you can decide how to interact with them both. \n\nAnd you certainly don\u2019t have to love an adult your father remarried because at your age, she\u2019s hardly going to be a step-parent to you unless this is something *you* want. \n\nEdit: It\u2019s upsetting for you as a child that lost his mother, but adults can self-determine and your father met this woman after your mother unfortunately passed. He\u2019s not morally reprehensible even if he *did* only marry her to assuage his loneliness.", "I think NAH. It's objectively a hard thing to do to grieve for your parent while your other parent 'moves on', as it were. On the flip side, this could well be your dad's way of coping with the grief (though the fact he did start dating her within six months doesn't show him in the best light).\n\nWhat I will say is that I don't think you need to either love her or agree with their marriage. You're an adult now, so you can ultimately decide how present she is in your life, and if she's nice then it should be easy enough to be civil with her when she is around. \n\nTaking away the 'guilt' of not loving her the way you feel like you should, will probably help your mental health in the long run.\n\nEDIT: I'm changing no NTA - I just reread the bit about your dad forcing you to meet her and not listening/understanding to your feelings about it. That's an AH move tbh.", "Wow, it took him only 6 months to start dating to fulfil desires of his lonely ass, and without respecting his previous wife he got engaged a year and a day later her death, disrespectful as hell. NTA", "NTA. I think moving on in 6 months after losing your wife is a very short amount of time. I understand everyone takes different amounts of time to grieve and heal, but if his children are taking longer to grieve than him, he is absolutely the AH for forcing you to try to move on and accept new girlfriend. I understand the feeling of not being able to emotionally connect to this new person despite them being nice, because emotionally, you are unable to do so. I do think it could be beneficial to have a conversation with the new girlfriend and explaining that the way you feel about them has nothing to do with them, and that they\u2019re very nice, but that you\u2019re still grieving and not ready to connect with them on the level they want.\n\nETA: cursing and getting mad at his children for expressing their feelings on the subject and getting engaged a day after the anniversary of his wife\u2019s passing is VERY odd and honestly if he continued to show now consideration for his children\u2019s feelings and respect for his previous wife I would be going no contact as soon as I moved out.", "NTA. It was an AH move on your dads part to not hear you out when you to expressed that you weren\u2019t ready to meet his gf. \n\nHowever it\u2019s his life and he\u2019s no longer married and he\u2019s free to date or get engaged and even get married again. You don\u2019t really have a choice but to accept it as fact. You don\u2019t have to like it\u2026 you\u2019re allowed to have whatever feelings you have about the situation. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss. I hope you are speaking with a grief counselor.", "NTA. People have different grieving periods. Some are faster than others. There is nothing wrong with you being accepting of this marriage. Your dad is TA for not understanding that you are still grieving. Forcing someone to meet another is just going to further damage the  relationship you have with your dad and the possible future relationship to your dad's new partner.", "YTA, it's not a child's place to judge their parents dating lives, the child doesn't have to like it the child just has to be respectful.", "Nta but neither is your dad", "NTA, You don't have to accept it. My suggestion is to just leave it be. He cannot force you to accept anything that you dont want to.", "Piece of advice: you don't have to love her.

As long as that all stays inside your head and is not being expressed to them, your internal feelings are valid. \n\nMy parents separated briefly and both forced me to meet their new partners under false pretences, after I communicated my refusal to do this for either of them.  Just ignored me and put me on the spot so I \u201cwould be nice\u201d. I was around 22 then. They\u2019ve long since gotten back together, but I don\u2019t think my relationship with them was ever the same after that.", "You make a fair point.", "My father died in 2013. I would not have given a shit if my mother started dating within six months. People don't want to be alone. It's understandable.\n\nQuit judging how people grieve when their spouse passes away.", "You left out the part where OP was 21 years old with two older brothers. They aren't a bunch of kids, the are a bunch of Adults. Everyone gets a chance to live their life, Dad included", "and ops dad is done grieving, so op doesn\u2019t have the right to tell her dad that he is wrong for getting engaged so soon. he doesn\u2019t have the right to force her to meet his fianc\u00e9 and try and force op to like her.\n\nESH", "Yes we were. My second oldest brother is the most level headed person I have ever met. My dad had lashed out at him when he went to go take a walk. I spoke to, at the time, his girlfriend but I left quickly after because I was so hurt.", "But you specifically used \"no assholes here\" instead of \"not the asshole\". You, yourself, opened the conversation to be about more people than just OP.", "Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f", "I mean it was SIX months after her mother (and I\u2019m assuming his wife) died. I\u2019d be pissed too. I think this then blinds any ability to accept the following relationship stages with ease. (Edit: realised I was agreeing with you so don\u2019t know why I typed it so aggressively sorry!!)\n\nNTA - you\u2019re dad being unable to accept that HIS actions make it harder for you to do want he now wants doesn\u2019t make you an AH. You wanting more time doesn\u2019t necessarily make you an AH but I think realistically you need to build up to it. Mentally prepare yourself and give yourself a timeline (e.g. a year) where you will take steps to make this happen. Go to therapy if you can afford it or read books on grief if you can\u2019t and move forward with this. If you let this go on much longer you\u2019ll end up definitely the AH", "O", "Thank you \ud83d\udc96"]}
