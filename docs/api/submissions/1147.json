Yet another controlling parent who thinks kids are possessions not people. You have a right to privacy OP.", "NTA - It sounds to me like something the two of you should have talked about a little more before your mum came and reacted in this way. You are 17 years old and its important for you to have your own space. It's her house, so I can understand if you had some rotting food or dirty stuff in there she might get mad, but it sounds like organised chaos that helped you locate everything in your room.\n\nMoving forward though, maybe talk to your mother about why this space was important to you and what she would ideally expect you to do with all your stuff. If you can reach a compromise (boxes under the table or in a cupboard) that would be great, but she is certainly in the wrong here if what you were storing wasn't offensive on its own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
