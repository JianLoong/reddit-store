I thank and say bye to the hosts and then try to skip out.\nI could be an offender myself  but I will say NTA", "NTA/ESH. Yes, it was a rude, but I wouldn't call you an AH for it, sounds like you did the right thing in trying to make up for it and getting their numbers so you could apologise. \n\nYour girlfriend refusing to give you their numbers so you can make it right seems immature to me. She's angry and expects better of you, but isn't allowing you to do the right thing by helping you to reach out to her friends. \n\nI'd say use this as a learning curve for you in the future, if someone asks \"aren't you going to do X\" it's likely because they think you SHOULD do X", "Don't worry about that, when this relationship began it already had a thoroughly discussed expiration date\n\nEdit: we talked about this before anything began", "I don't blame you, part of why I keep to myself is that there's some obvious things in social interaction that grinds my gears, like for example, being required to verbalize what I had expressed multiple times in other ways previously.", "As previously stated, I was originally going to ask for an integer response, not a boolean.\n\nYea yea, common courtesy, I get it, it's just kinda exhausting to me sometimes. Again, not much of a people person", "It was more of a tame diner then a party and I would had already left by the time the cleaning began anyway", "Wolves", "You have a lot o pent up angst, don't you?\n\nI had made breakfast and payed for their week's groceries as a gesture of gratefulness the same day\n\nI wasn't drunk, I felt ill exactly because I don't usually drink\n\nI was going to call them, actually. To apologize, not for shiting in their living room, but for not saying goodbye", "I originally would like to ask \"how much of an ah am I\" cus I'm comfortable with a certain margin, but thanks for your 2 cents", "Im thinking about it already, probably with not the best thinking buddies the internet can offer, but you're alright", "It's not hard, I had been very cordial otherwise and had thanked them specifically for having me before, it was just this specific moment when I just didn't felt like doing it", "Parties are definitely a little different than being hosted in someone\u2019s home for days. GF didn\u2019t say he should\u2019ve kept hanging out, just that he should have said thanks and bye. Which is so easy. \u201cAlright y\u2019all, I\u2019m not feeling great so I\u2019m going to bed. Thank you for having me, I hope I see y\u2019all again soon!\u201d", "Do her a favor and fuck off then! You've got an attitude problem", "Then why did you date her?

I don\u2019t even know what else to say, that\u2019s just beyond rude.", "I can agree that some social norms are repetitive or unnecessary, but that\u2019s not an excuse to just ignore your hosts and leave lol.", "Not being much of a people person doesn't excuse you from the norms.\n\nYou won't be the one to change society or the norms.", "My point was more that they were going to be cleaning up after a party for you so that would warrant a thank you imo.", "Clearly.", "I can see that.", "I don't know how to convey my line of though concisely, but gracefulness is not related to gratefulness. You can be polite and still be an asshole, and I don't belive being impolite automatically makes you an asshole.\n\nWas I impolite? Yes, I agree I was, but I don't believe I was an asshole overall.", "You're the one telling people to fuck off on the internet, pal. Also, she can decide to finish this relationship whenever she feels like it, I ain't forcing her on neither way", "We're dating each other. She made this decision as well\n\nI didn't, actually, but this sub only let me ask if Im an ah and not how much", "It's not, this was throughly talked about before the relationship began, it's not a unilateral thing", "That's the thing tho, I can see how that can be construed as ignoring, but I disagree with that interpretation, cus it doesn't take in consideration any of the previous interactions", "I don't want to change society, I just don't expect formalities towards me and don't perform formalities out of fear of peer pressure", "It\u2019s just the way you said it with no explanation makes it seem very rude. You were obviously just snapping back at someone\u2019s comment. If you don\u2019t want them to actually answer, then don\u2019t ask.", "It can't be construed as anything, because you DID ignore.\n\nWhen you stay with someone, for WEEKS, you should go out of your way to be helpful and thank them. They don't have to open their home and play host.", "Ok then, let me ask: \n\nDid you say goodbye to them earlier on or tell them you\u2019re leaving?\n\nI think the bigger issue isn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t thank them again, but the fact that you just left without saying anything. What if you were having a problem or they still wanted to talk to you? Also it is SO EASY to just say bye.", "You can absolutely feel that it shouldn\u2019t be construed that way, but you are completely ignoring how it makes others feel.

Really? \n\nInstead you had to make a whole stink about it, double down and now you're girlfriend and all her friends are pissed off at you. I'm sure you could care less about them, which she now knows.", "I'm not sure I understood your last point... What question are you talking about?", "I went out of my way to be helpful and thank them, I just didn't say goodbye before I went to sleep on the other room", "I didn't left the house, I just went to a different room. Every one knew I was going away before dawn, so it wasn't a surprise when I left.\n\nI didn't say specifically goodbye, but I had said thanks for hosting me earlier in the day.", "Yes. I know this makes me an asshole of some magnetude, but I don't agree with the magnetude I've been assigned", "I indeed could care less, cus I do care, i just don't believe this polite little gestures are the way to measure it. In fact, politeness for politeness sake means very little to me. I had shown appreciation in other ways already, and they knew I was leaving that night. At that point thanks and goodbye were just formalities.\n\nBut what do i know, im just an asshole on the internet"]}
