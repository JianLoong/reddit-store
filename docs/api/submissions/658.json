She was crying, called me judgmental &selfish &said how much this has damaged our relationship.\n\nI 37f have a company &was looking for a worker. My older sister 39f just got fired from her work &was dealing with other personal issues in her life.\n\nOur mother 60y asked me if it's possible to hire my sister. My sister had not really asked for my help in this regards. Long story short,I hired my sister. She got a type A visa, which is one of the best visas you can have in this foreign country.\n\nFor context,she needed a visa to stay in this foreign country. She was also going to use that said visa to petition for her daughter to come here as well as apply for social benefits for her newborn son.\n\nI hired my sister since I was going to hire someone anyway. So why not her? &also she does have some qualifications in the field. So her hiring is not purely blind. There's some merit to it.\n\n1y into her employment, she went into 1y of paid maternity leave. She was employed for a total of 3y.She also got into a 2y-apprenticeship with my encouragement and support.\n\nWhen she came back to work after her maternity leave, her work performance was greatly affected.\n\nPersonally I understand that she has a lot going on: newborn son, daughter just started school, going back to work, starting school, learning a new language. To clarify, where we are work-life balance is of top priority, so i know for a fact that all workers in my company are given the same workload &same work hours. I have other mothers as employees, &I myself am a mother of 2.\n\nDuring her employment, she would come in late for work, leave early, not attend meetings or stay shorter than everyone else, use work resources for personal use, etc\n\nDue to her lackluster performance, I decided  not to renew her work contract. I informed her in 04/2022, her contract ends in 06/2022. We are in Scandinavia, so Europeans can understand this (probably a foreign concept for Americans).\n\nINFO 'coz it's a recurring question: We have had development discussions focused on how our company can help her. We've given her an hour everyday just for her planning, hired another worker to help her out even though it was unnecessary, lessened her workload and been very flexible whenever she needed to be off from work, etc\n\nOur parents, especially our mom, made me feel so bad about it. How can I not think about my niece and nephew's future? I should let my older sister stay in the company until she finishes her studies, or at least until she has found another job.\n\nMy sister feels the same way. How can I be so selfish? How could I do this to her at this time of her life? (The son is 2y by now.) Why do I \"add salt to her wound\"? How could I keep putting her down when she's already down?\n\nI told our mom &my sister that my sister wasn't \"down\": her visa is renewed for another 4y so as her children's, she has more qualifications than most people who apply in this field, &she speaks the language that is required in this field. She is actually in a very good position.\n\nUpdate: she has already found a job and claims that she's more valued and appreciated there.\n\nAITA for not renewing her contract at that time?", "created_utc": 1667022449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygbdlr/aita_for_letting_my_older_sister_39f_go/", "score": 1339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because she\u2019s your sister, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should treat her differently.

Though I don\u2019t have children, I know it\u2019s very tiring, but it\u2019s no excuse to be straight up incompetent seeing OP also having 2 children. Yes, dealing with children - especially young ones - IS indeed stressful, but if she cannot manage her work-life balance, it\u2019s quite clear that the best option is to stop work for a while until she can get back to being able to handle work and her children. \nOwning a company, you have to make sacrifices. Employees are hired to work, not to be treated like a princess and be given privileges. If OP\u2019s sister was incompetent in her work, she shouldn\u2019t have continued, especially since she\u2019s an adult, she should be able to see the effort and time put in to help her although she should have dealt with her children first.\nSo, NTA.

Ultimately you cannot keep employing someone whose performance is unsatisfactory, regardless of your private relationship.
