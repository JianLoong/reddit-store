Why are you tolerating such ridiculous behavior?", "NTA. \n\nNo offense, but your 21 year old still has a lot of growing up to do. \n\nThere is no way my 20 year old would eat his sibling\u2019s food and then, on top of that, have the nerve to get upset about not getting a second meal as part of the replacement delivery for the food he wasn\u2019t supposed to eat in the first place.", "NTA but your oldest son is for wanting two meals.", "NTA.
