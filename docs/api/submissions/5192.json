There is life outside of the job.", "NTA & check your local employment laws; if you're being forced to perform job duties during your lunch or on PTO then your local law may stipulate you must be compensated.

In the US, most large companies refuse to answer questions about previous employees other than dates of employment and final salary.  However, I do still hear about hiring companies asking very intrusive questions and this seems like the place that would try to blackball a former employee.", "I think OP was referring to the next job after the job she is leaving her current job for.", "I don't think it's my problem either since I'm leaving. My only concern is in the future, if any prospective employers call my former employer, they would not recommend me.\n\nAlso I would be compensated if I work OT (not during lunch) but I don't want to stay past regular hours.", "But they're not obligated to work overtime, especially if they're suffering from burnout.", "That's very unfortunate. Does your boss know that you can't afford to leave early? Because if he doesn't then you can tell him you will leave early if she doesn't stop calling you after work and during your break.

If the boss can't do your job then you hold all the power here.  Because if you choose to be done today, that puts THEM in a bind.  Not the other way around.  \n\nYou could always offer to start at your new job sooner.", "NTA, but do you have any written documentation and guides on how to do your work? I know the feeling of being the only one who can do something and having to hand it over to someone else. It helps to have written stuff that they can be directed to. Technically with only 2 weeks notice you should really be almost coasting - at the beginning of two weeks giving your replacement the written guides and any access she needs, work through training demo with her and making her do practice herself, she should review the written stuff in time when she's not being directly trained, and the remainder of the two weeks she's doing the work while you just answer any questions not covered by the documentation or correct her, while you tidy up loose ends.  Depending on the job some of those questions might be time sensitive, but if they are, instead of messaging you to ask if she can call, she can more easily message you the question for you to identify if it's urgent or not \nand respond or ignore accordingly. This is where a culture of overworking affects everyone, if your coworker is also being expected to work overtime and through lunches it means she's trying to get things done and questions answered during times when you aren't available, so puts pressure on you to work those same times. The issue compounds itself.\n\nSet your boundaries, and stick to it. Explain to your coworker why you are doing this, that it's not an attempt to sabotage her, but you can't do this anymore. What are they going to do? Fire you?", "If you stay long enough at the next job, this previous job won't even matter that much.  The AH supervisor may not even be employed there at that point anymore, or the company may not continue to exist.", "You can always say you worked there but that it's not okay to call them.\n\nMany HR departments have a rule that they only verify that you were an employee and for how long.  Nothing more than that.  Because it opens them up to lawsuits if they defame you.\n\nOf course I'm not sure where you're from, but I was personal friends with HR at a former job and that was their policy.  To verify employment and length of employment. Nothing more.", "Right, but if they are working overtime then they should be working. If they're not working overtime then they shouldn't answer working calls.", "I do. I created many detailed written documentation and guides on how to do my work. I also recorded training videos (even though I am uncomfortable with the idea). The questions she asks are in the documentation which I have told her.", "I'm not working overtime. This always happens when I decide to leave during regular hours. People would reach out to me at 5:01pm.", "If you have no system to instant get an hour overtime for answering a work call after hours then never answer a work call after hours. You're exchanging your time for money- that's every job - if they are not paying you, they don't get your time, not a singular second."]}
