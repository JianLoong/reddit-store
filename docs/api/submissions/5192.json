I know the feeling of being the only one who can do something and having to hand it over to someone else. It helps to have written stuff that they can be directed to. Technically with only 2 weeks notice you should really be almost coasting - at the beginning of two weeks giving your replacement the written guides and any access she needs, work through training demo with her and making her do practice herself, she should review the written stuff in time when she's not being directly trained, and the remainder of the two weeks she's doing the work while you just answer any questions not covered by the documentation or correct her, while you tidy up loose ends.  Depending on the job some of those questions might be time sensitive, but if they are, instead of messaging you to ask if she can call, she can more easily message you the question for you to identify if it's urgent or not \nand respond or ignore accordingly. This is where a culture of overworking affects everyone, if your coworker is also being expected to work overtime and through lunches it means she's trying to get things done and questions answered during times when you aren't available, so puts pressure on you to work those same times.

He cannot train your replacement, so I doubt he'll \"fire\" you. Stick to your guns, don't answer that phone.", "I hope you get an exit interview! Also, you've already handed in your two weeks so your boss' standards have ceased to matter.", "You quit. You have already put in your two weeks. What are they going to do? Fire you?", "New employers will be really sympathetic if you bring this kind of thing up from the get go when they inevitably ask \u201cwhy did you leave your last job?\u201d\nIf you clearly explain valid reasons like this, it sets a really good precedent going forwards.", "And if you explain that you left the job due to not being respected on the job, and being forced to regularly work OT that you didn't want to work, they'll know what kind of working relationship you expect and decide whether or not you're a good fit for their company.", "Then you need to familiarise them with the magic words: RTFM", "OP: NTA. What are they going to do, fire you? You\u2019ve already quit. When she tries this next, tell her \u201cyou have the documentation. I\u2019m training you to be self-sufficient.\u201d", "Exactly, I did this recently, I was just being honest at the time but it worked out really well, set a good standard from the start and stick to it. If they don\u2019t hire you after that it\u2019s because they do the same shit and you dodged a bullet.\n\nTo add, I left a job where I was getting irregular 4hr shifts, often being called in an hour before work, to total like 20 hours a week while being available 24/7. It was shit, and I said so. I now work 4 days 9 hours per day, regular shifts, for better money. Simply because I asked for it when I changed jobs, and I do actually put in solid work WHEN I\u2019m on the clock which helps too.", "That\u2019s the end of your responsibility right there and you are 1000% NTA for ghosting after doing all that and explaining your reasons. If they won\u2019t hear you that\u2019s on them. They\u2019re going to miss you."]}
