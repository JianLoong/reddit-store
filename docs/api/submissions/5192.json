I know the feeling of being the only one who can do something and having to hand it over to someone else. It helps to have written stuff that they can be directed to. Technically with only 2 weeks notice you should really be almost coasting - at the beginning of two weeks giving your replacement the written guides and any access she needs, work through training demo with her and making her do practice herself, she should review the written stuff in time when she's not being directly trained, and the remainder of the two weeks she's doing the work while you just answer any questions not covered by the documentation or correct her, while you tidy up loose ends.  Depending on the job some of those questions might be time sensitive, but if they are, instead of messaging you to ask if she can call, she can more easily message you the question for you to identify if it's urgent or not \nand respond or ignore accordingly. This is where a culture of overworking affects everyone, if your coworker is also being expected to work overtime and through lunches it means she's trying to get things done and questions answered during times when you aren't available, so puts pressure on you to work those same times.

Nothing more than that.
