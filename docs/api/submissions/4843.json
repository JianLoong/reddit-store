Even if you were 50 years old you are not your sister's keeper.\n\nShe made her choices and you have absolutely no obligation to her or to be her support critter.  (I'm assuming that she wants you to take her side when dealing with your parents.)\n\nNTA.", "Info: Where are your parents in all of this?", " NTA - you and your sister are literally children yourselves.  You care about her and you are aware that her life is going in a very difficult direction--you absolutely do have the right to your feelings and your upset.  But you can't deal with this yourself, it's not your responsibility to \"support\" her.  Where are your parents in this?  Are they aware?  It's not your job to tell them, but your sister really should so they can help her in whatever way is appropriate.  And you need their help too because this is obviously being very hard on you.", "NTA. Unless there is good reason to believe your parents would get violent, you need to tell them. There is a narrow window for options to be chosen. Adults need to be involved in this process because your sister will need financial support for years to come. She will need money even to give birth. If the father of the fetus is already in legal trouble he is unlikely to offer that support. Please don't stay silent and hold the weight of this on your shoulders.", "Uh, don't you have parents? Or I don't know, a local police department? A pregnant 15 year old girl is a major issue and requires the involvement of responsible adults, which you are not.", "INFO\n\nWhy would you even be responsible for supporting your sister in the first place?", "NTA- it's not your problem. Also, if she's 15 she shouldn't even be having a baby, unless she plans on living with her boyfriend forever, and knowing how highschool relationships go? She's gonna end up a single mom most likely. If she wants to ever yk, go to college and get a job, you really can't have a child at the same time as that. Unfortunately, collage itself takes up a lot of time, and if you want to financially support yourself at the same time you're left with effectively no free time, let alone enough time for a baby. If she has this child she's probably gonna end up dropping out of school, since it will obliterate her sleep schedule and probably also her grades, and she won't have time for school if she wants to do things like, take care of the baby.", "I'd say neither cus you 15 and shouldn't be even thinking about this lol", "INFO: How old is her boyfriend?", "NTA. You two are literally children. What has you feeling that you have to support her? How have your parents reacted to this? Are there any resources at school that could be of help, like a counselor?", "Your parents need to be involved, NOW. This baby is NOT your responsibility and neither is your sister. She also needs to see a doctor for prenatal care. Please tell your parents before this becomes a total shit show. NTA", "My sister is a very big part of my life. I'm worried.

It may be hard, but time to get some help -- from an adult you trust.", "NTA but you have to let your sister fight her own battles. Don't you have anyone to talk to?", "NTA- I was my little sisters guardian for a time, while I was pregnant. she was involved with this boy who went to juvie. I told her that if she\u2019s having sex with him, she needs to get on birth control. Bc no way in hell is my 15 year old sister whom is under my care having a baby while I am also having a baby. She doesn\u2019t believe in abortion, so I made sure to tell her to use protection. Nothing ever came of it, and she eventually broke up with him, thank god. But she did still cause to much trouble in my household and I had to pass her care onto a wonderful foster mom, whom she has a great relationship with and is now flourishing and thriving. \n\nMy point here is that you are not wrong for putting down boundaries with your sister. She is not your responsibility, and neither is that baby is she has it. Please stop justifying to yourself your codependent relationship with her. You can have a healthy bond with your twin without taking personal responsibility away from her and onto yourself. Don\u2019t enable her, tell her straight up her decision is her problem. It might make her think twice, but beyond that it\u2019s not in your hands what she does or does not do. Healthy boundaries in personal relationships will not only help you, but will also help her.", "NTA. You keep on loving your sister.  You go ahead and love her child. Absolutely DO NOT put yourself in a caretaker role in your sister's offspring.  You can choose if and when you interact with her child..", "NTA: where are your parents in all this?", "NTA. Please talk to your adults about what's going on. Her child is not your responsibility, in any way! You're both still children!  \nI had to be an aunt at your age, and it very much changed my life.", "NTA- saying you are not going to support someone\u2019s life choices is fine. It may be something she needs to hear at 15.\n\nIf you suspect your sister is being pressured or coerced by her boyfriend then tell an adult you can trust.   If you suspect abuse please contact someone or else it will get worse.", "NAH\n\nYou and your twin need different types of help. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to support her financially at 15. However, she will always be your sister. Seeing a counselor may be beneficial for you. Don\u2019t feel bad about your reaction, y\u2019all *are* kids and it\u2019s a large change.\n\nI hope your sister has helpful adults in her life to go through different health options with her, as well as to make sure her boyfriend is treating her in an acceptable way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One should never have a child they know they will not be able to care for.

Your opinion of your sister has changed this drastically because she\u2019s gonna have a kid? \n\nShe\u2019s probably in the worst headspace rn. All she needs rn is support in whatever decision she makes.

The odds of you being able to raise a healthy child are very low. I mean no offense but you are absolutely no better off than your sister is to raise this child. If you're genuinely concerned for it's wellbeing, call child protective services. It doesn't even necessarily have to be born yet, if she's planning on keeping it she (and I believe her guardians/your parents) can be held accountable to provide/find a proper home for the baby. Do not do a disservice to this child by attempting to be responsible for it. As much as I hate the government and social service systems, there's a time and place to call. This seems like it might be one of those times from the way you word things.\n\nTldr; not your job, get social services involved if it's as bad as you say.", "Nta. Do not set yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "NTA. People make bad relationship choices, it's part of life and how we learn what's best for us. You don't need to support her or her child. Just be there, and let her know you love her. If you are right about this guy, she might really need to know that you are a person she can feel safe around.\n\nIt's obvious you love her a lot, and that the thought of her getting hurt is tearing you up, but sometimes we have to let people make their own choices and the consequences that come after.", "YTA\n\nAt first I  thought you meant financial support, but you mean emotional support. \n\nSeems like you need to remember that you are not small children anymore. I understand your concern, my sister had a teen pregnancy and the sperm donor bailed, so  I really get it.\n\nNow to the point, you love her or this wouldn't bother you but this isn't your decision and your sister needs you now. You can disagree with her choices and be upset that the dynamic of your relationship is changing and still be there for her. \n\nDon't throw away your relationship with your sister. If you are concerned about the boyfriend, talk to your parents or a school counselor...someone, but do not disregard your sisters feelings. Maybe she really wants to keep the baby despite the boyfriend.", "Soft YtTA.\n\nIf your sister is 15, I would hope parents were involved also as that is a huge decision.\n\nWhether you \"support' her decision to keep the baby really doesn't matter.

In no way, no shape should you be financially responsible for her baby. Yes, your parents will have to help until she is legally able to get a job, but you should not be held responsible.  It\u2019s not your child. You should not have to make the sacrifices that she will need to. \n\nDo you two share a room? Is there another room for one of you to move into before baby is born?

Do your parents know what is going on?", "Look I am going to blunt, your sister and her kid are not your problem, you need to live your childhood. If she thinks she is old enough to have sex and decide to keep a pregnancy, she is old enough to not have her brother hold her hand and basically raise her kid. If you are so concerned, get your parents involved, find resources at planned parenthood, but your *sister and her baby are **NOT** your responsibility*.\n\nEdit: a word", "Listen kid, the only people who are obligated to help your sister or her baby are the people who had a hand in making them or raising them. Ie. Your sister/boyfriend and your parents. DO NOT put your life on hold or set yourself on fire to help them. Focus on your education and your future only. Once you're in a position to support and sustain yourself, THEN you can maybe think about helping.", "Don\u2019t listen to these people. You are not bad and you did nothing wrong. This all boils down to how much you love your sister and that\u2019s understandable but you really should tell an adult. Carrying a baby could end very badly for her especially if the bf is introducing her to bad substances. People can die during childbirth especially if everything isn\u2019t perfect. If she isn\u2019t going to the doctor or taking vitamins she could have the baby die in her and that\u2019s another issue. Your sister needs your support and the best way to support her right now is to get her help. Tell a parent, doctor, or teacher any trusted adult of you could loose your sister completely.", "Seriously, like, emotional support makes sense but all of the other stuff? Unless your plans go seriously wrong and you already had plans in the first place (ex, your husband dies in some tragic accident and you can't work because of disability or something like that) don't expect help, you've gotta plan your own life like no one is gonna ever help you because otherwise if worst comes to worst you're pretty screwed", "Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to take care of the baby. That is your sister and your parents job. Refuse to help, because again it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "You seem like a caring person, but you need to sit back and let your sister handle this kid if she decides to have it. If things get really bad, then call CPS, it may be harsh, but it will give your sister a reality check. You are just a child yourself, you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for another human being (and I mean both your sister and her kid."]}
