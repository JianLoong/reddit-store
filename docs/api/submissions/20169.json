I let the neighbours know about the vomiting just in case it was a bug and definitely let them know about the strep throat because it is so contagious.", "Nta.  She is delusional.

Maybe she has loved ones for whom Covid for example would pose a higher risk, and she is nervous about exposing them.\n\nWhile most of the world has moved on from the pandemic, that is not true for certain people with impacted immune systems or other health issues; it just became more dangerous for them because nobody else pays attention anymore. And since many illnesses like Covid are contagious before symptoms show up, and you did not even want to test your kids, I understand that she might have been anxious.\n\nMy sons school still routinely sends emails around when they become aware of a Covid exposure in school; so expecting parents of regular playmates to tell each other does not seem so outrageous to me.", "NAH.

We\u2019ve learned a lot already from Covid in terms of potential for long term consequences - it is entirely possible that we have not been taking flu seriously enough in the past as a risk factor either.", "Disagree. If I happen to see you out, I'll mention the kids are sick. But proactive blanket texts to neighbors? No. Clearly there is no neighborhood expectation of information sharing here, either, or the OP would have heard about dozens of minor illnesses various children have had so far.", "The flu kills, getting run over by a car kills, water kills, too much oxygen kills.... Everything kills. \n\n\nIt's not reasonable to make a radio broadcast to the whole 'hood when the minutest of illnesses pop up", "Even though, it\u2019s absolutely none of her business, you would send out a text. Shaking my head.", "I would hope any immunocompromised person understands that most kids are walking Petri dishes and act accordingly.", "Yea so that kid your kid was playing with yesterday is sick now. Maybe don't go visit Grandma with a compromised immune system for a few days. A little heads up from the sick kids mom might prevent a serious infection in someone.", "I don't fault parents for not knowing their kid is sick before the symptoms show.  But if our kids are playing together today & tomorrow your kids have a fever, the courteous thing to do would be to shoot me a quick text to let me know & to be on the lookout for similar symptoms.  I might decide to not go visit my 78 year old father with that knowledge.  To me it's about making informed decisions.", "Thank you for being responsible! I got two nasty cases of strep throat in second grade because kids kept getting sent to school sick and no one seemed to care. We were only ever warned if someone got lice. I always informed my kid\u2019s school when they came down with anything infectious.", "It was a contagious illness that would require more attention, it would be good manners to inform people they recently came into contact with.NAT", "Absolutely And it\u2019s actually pretty hard to know if a young kid - he\u2019s 4 - has strep symptoms unless you hear something through the grapevine (from other parents, etc). My sons symptoms were lethargy and very low grade fever - he was more visibly sick last summer from playing outside too long when it was hot. No complaints about a sore throat. I wouldn\u2019t have thought to get him tested specifically for strep except I knew from \u201cthe mom chat\u201d that other kids in his class had been sick. \n\nMy husband\u2019s grandmother lost part of her hearing to scarlet fever so it\u2019s crazy to me that there are people who think it shouldn\u2019t be treated (often people who also don\u2019t vaccinate).", "Good to know.  I wonder if that applies to a mammogram as well?", "There are so many more symptoms to covid and the flu besides a cough and a fever. Hell, those two are symptoms of sooooo many things.", "the OP did not go into what the kids were sick with. just that they weren't feeling well which is not a definite symptom of any cold/flu/covid.   If they were coughing/sneezing/vomiting and fever/chills then ok they need to tell people.", "Lmao call the mayor, her kids got a slight fever and cough. Alert the CDC. No parent is obligated to disclose medical information or alert anyone whenever there is a minor sickness. That\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s honestly none of anyone else\u2019s business. If she wants to do it as a courtesy, more power to her, but to insinuate it\u2019s required or necessary, is ridiculous.\n\nStop making up hypotheticals to fit your narrative also.

Stick to the info provided.", "There\u2019s no way to know that there\u2019s \u201cno immune compromised kids in the neighborhood,\u201d as [anyone who has had a Covid infection](https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/covid-19-study-suggests-long-term-damage-immune-system) can have a compromised immune system, and just may not know it yet. \n\nEven if kids are fine, they can asymptotically pass it on to parents, family members, etc who DO have a compromised immune system.\n\nPeople seem to have completely disregarded the whole \u201cit takes a village\u201d approach to raising kids in favor of \u201cdon\u2019t you DARE tell me how to raise my kids!\u201d approach and it\u2019s really sad to see.", "Ok, so don\u2019t let your kids outside. People could be asymptomatic, not show signs and still transmit. So why wait until there\u2019s all the symptoms and for the neighbor to tell. Don\u2019t risk it. Seclude yourself and your kids.", "Neither does COVID. That\u2019s an insanely skewed and intentionally misinterpreted stat.", "Do you. You are making smart choices for yourself and those around you. I\u2019m sure you are used to the naysayers and detractors. I\u2019ve had enough covid patients to know what this virus does, and I\u2019ve had covid and I know what it\u2019s like to live with the long term stuff. Keep doing what\u2019s RIGHT FOR YOU. Those who are privileged will live in their own bubbles until they have a valid reason to ditch the ableism. I\u2019m sorry for the hate you undoubtedly receive.", "If you are immunocompromised you have a harder time mounting a defense against an infection. So the same bacteria or virus that makes one person a li sick can land you in the hospital.", "PREACH. So tired of people thinking masks get in the way of \u201cliving life\u201d. You know what does get in the way of me living my life? Landing in the hospital from Covid or worse\u2026dying.", "This is not all meant as a snide question, but being immune compromised (as immune systems aren't all or nothing so it can vary), are other illness like colds, flus, or bacterial infections also a lethal risk to you?", "You aren\u2019t on lockdown? Weird, why stop precautions and behaviors related to Covid? You must travel and go outside regularly? So really you meant ONLY wearing a mask right? You stopped most other precautions I assume.", "We had Covid yet we are not immune compromised. What kind of paranoid nonsense is that?", "THANK YOU for speaking up on this. The whole world has seemingly forgotten how debilitating Covid can become. I\u2019m still masking up and taking as many precautions as possible. Why people want to raw dog it and end up disabled and being immunocompromised (which Covid can do, and repeated infections make things even worse) is beyond me. I\u2019m disabled and wouldn\u2019t wish a bad day on anyone.", "It becomes her business if her kids caught it too and might give it to someone they are concerned about. Shaking my head about the selfishness of some as well.", "And I would hope anyone, regardless of immune status, would understand the difference between standard colds and major immune events like COVID and be empathetic to the request to alert in a world that is not truly post-pandemic. And be able to acknowledge the fact that they don\u2019t know everyone\u2019s personal circumstances.", "Because I'm disabled and live in the house? There's virtually no way to avoid it in shared spaces.", "Strep can lead to rheumatic fever, which can damage your heart.

Did you even read what I wrote? You sound hysterical.", "My gf went on a trip overseas a few weeks ago and managed to transmit it to me when she got home while fully vaccinated and asymptomatic! You can never really hide from it. Just like any other bug a kid could pick up unknowingly at school. Keeping them home when they\u2019re sick is due diligence. It\u2019s been three years. The newest strains of COVID have weakened considerably.", "You\u2019re right. [It\u2019s more like 1 in 3.](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kids-similar-risk-long-covid-adults-study-suggests)", "They are a huge risk. If your immune system is compromised it means you are much more likely to catch illness and have a harder time fighting it off. A simple cold or flu could mean hospitalization.", "Why does it bother you so much that they wear a mask lol", "they mean that they are immunocompromised so they will struggle if they get covid, not that covid causes it", "Covid damages the immune system, go read some research.", "Well, then we\u2019re going to appoint you to take care of it. There\u2019s about 30 kids there. How many parents do you think you need to contact. Maybe put aside a couple of hours to take care of this.  Since you\u2019re not related to any of these kids, you\u2019re not allowed to tell them exactly what\u2019s wrong with the children. HIPAA protects them from this.", "You\u2019re responsible for your own health and for not taking risks that would cause you harm. Again, asking for an alert is pointless when so many people pass illness before they know they\u2019re sick. Best of luck to you.", "OP as a parent has that under control. It\u2019s not end of the world because even Covid for non-obese, healthy c h i l d r e n  is 99% harmless.

Claiming a 10% chance of extended symptoms, keep the kids at home.", "That's really not true. If anything they are getting better at spreading. New variants are not more deadly but they're also certainly not less deadly.", "Oh yeah i know it can be, but some diseases can be more deadly than others depending on how severely immunocompromised you are. Like the difference between neutropenia and chemotherapy's immune system nuke. I was curious about that person's specific case", "Where did I say that? I clearly said \u201cno hate do you\u201d. Has nothing to do with the mask. Maybe the part where they suggested everyone shouldn\u2019t abandon Covid precautions and behavior\u2026people can do whatever they like, just don\u2019t force your beliefs on others by moral grandstanding.", "No actually covid does impact your immune system. That's why once everyone stopped masking and started getting a \" really bad cold\", it had nothing to do with the cold virus.

I explained why that wasn't so. \n\nNext, I basically agreed with OP that because her kid's illness was very mild, it was basically OK to not notify the neighbors.

Maybe you should go take a break and cool down.", "I can\u2019t answer for the other person, but my late husband had a heart condition. He was told just before the pandemic that if he got any kind of bad infection, he wouldn\u2019t survive it. And then COVID happened.
