You don't owe a sick alert to the neighborhood, you owe responsible behavior which you demonstrated.  Curious to know if your neighbor has ever told you when her kids were sick.", "NTA - kids were sick and you isolated them. Good job mom.", "NTA - keeping them separate from the neighborhood kids was perfectly reasonable and if a neighbor thinks they are somehow entitled to your families full medical history because they live on the same street, they are sorely mistaken. Perhaps ask your neighbor if you need their permission before getting a colonoscopy. The audacity is overwhelming.", "NTA- you stopped yours from playing with others when you saw they were sick...that is way more then many parents in my area do.  Now if you suspect they had the flu, covid, chickenpox etc then yes you should tell other parents so they can look out for any signs.", "NTA...Kids come down with minor things constantly.  Your life would be nothing more than a series of phone calls back and forth about whose kid MIGHT have what.  You just have to gauge if this is one sensitive parent, or if this is the way most of this street operates.", "NTA - Covid made so many people loose their minds. No, she is not entitled to your private medical information or that of your family. She's more than out of line for making such demands. It's extremely inappropriate and she needs to understand boundaries.", "NTA if it was just a slight fever. If it develops into something else that is contagious then it would be polite to let the parents of the kids your kids play with know. Last Friday my 10 year old granddaughter was here along with two neighbouring kids for the afternoon. That night she started vomiting which continued two days and then was diagnosed with strep throat Monday. I let the neighbours know about the vomiting just in case it was a bug and definitely let them know about the strep throat because it is so contagious.", "Nta.  She is delusional.  You did what you were supposed to do, kept your kids inside when they were sick.  Their medical information is none of her business.", "NTA. If it was a contagious illness that would require more attention, it would be good manners to inform people they recently came into contact with.  But kids get sick all the time.  With that many kids playing together I guarantee you at least one kid is sick on any given day.", "Nta. They didn\u2019t have plague, meningitis or smallpox.", "NTA- what kind of cult shit is this...", "NTA. Your neighbour has unrealistic expectations. If any of your kids are subsequently diagnosed with a contagious infection (i.e. Covid) then I would consider it an expected courtesy that you would share that info with other families that might be affected due to recent close contact. But an \"alert\" every time a kid gets sick is dumb.", "NTA. Your neighbor is absolutely overstepping.", "NTA that's crazy talk.", "Does she alert all the parents when her kids are sick?  Nta but she is.", "NTA.\n\nYou're doing what you should by keeping your kids home and giving them time to rest, and not playing and potentially spreading illness with the other children while they're sick. \n\nMy response to the neighbor would have been: Why? Did your kid get mine sick? Are you offering to pay for the medical visit? If not, then I don't see how my currently isolated sick children are any of your business. Have a good day.", "NTA The only time you should ever need to disclose that information is if you think it's possible that your kids infected hers with something dangerous (COVID, pneumonia, things like that)", "NAH, just different expectations.  During the height of the pandemic, it became standard in many circles for parents to alert each other if anyone\u2019s kid got sick so the other kids who might have been exposed could be tested for Covid (even if the first child to get sick tested negative) to avoid spread.  Those expectations gradually died off for many people as Covid concerns eased, but different people have different expectations around the practice these days.", "NTA, it simply isn't realistic to track down everyone about every sickness everytime.", "NTA. Your response to your kids being sick was totally appropriate. Neighbor's response was off the rails.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t let them out, and assuming they never go out when sick, it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s concern or business.", "NAH. I mean, we just went through a worldwide pandemic, is it really that unreasonable for your neighbor to inquire whether your kids might have covid? You don't have to tell her, but it's not the end of the world that she asked.", "NTA. Also I have a feeling some of them might be antivaxxers. Idk how to explain it", "NTA\n\nThe sheer audacity...I just can't...\n\nYou keep doing you.  You're doing it exactly as you should.", "NTA - she isn't entitled to make her irrational fear your problem.", "NAH - you are of course not obligated to tell her, but I highly doubt that you know every detail about the health situation of her or her family (people close to her). Maybe she has loved ones for whom Covid for example would pose a higher risk, and she is nervous about exposing them.\n\nWhile most of the world has moved on from the pandemic, that is not true for certain people with impacted immune systems or other health issues; it just became more dangerous for them because nobody else pays attention anymore. And since many illnesses like Covid are contagious before symptoms show up, and you did not even want to test your kids, I understand that she might have been anxious.\n\nMy sons school still routinely sends emails around when they become aware of a Covid exposure in school; so expecting parents of regular playmates to tell each other does not seem so outrageous to me.", "NAH. They may also just be concerned if it was COVID. I would consider alerting neighbors, especially if there's regular contact among kids, If it there were signs of COVID symptoms.", "I'm going to go with a YTA: We are still dealing with COVID. And some families have immunocompromised and elderly folks at home. They do deserve a warning if the kids were playing with theirs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
