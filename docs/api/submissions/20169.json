I let the neighbours know about the vomiting just in case it was a bug and definitely let them know about the strep throat because it is so contagious.", "Nta.  She is delusional.

Maybe she has loved ones for whom Covid for example would pose a higher risk, and she is nervous about exposing them.\n\nWhile most of the world has moved on from the pandemic, that is not true for certain people with impacted immune systems or other health issues; it just became more dangerous for them because nobody else pays attention anymore. And since many illnesses like Covid are contagious before symptoms show up, and you did not even want to test your kids, I understand that she might have been anxious.\n\nMy sons school still routinely sends emails around when they become aware of a Covid exposure in school; so expecting parents of regular playmates to tell each other does not seem so outrageous to me.", "NAH.

A couple of days later, I'm on antibiotics for bronchitis, laryngitis, and pharyngitis, signed off sick for the week. I tried to go back but got sent home again because I was still so sick. I ended up being off for 2 weeks and got a disciplinary and dismissal - probationers weren't allowed more than 4 days off, even with a doctor's note, so I was sacked because someone else made me sick! Probably wouldn't have happened if the staff hadn't been threatened with their jobs if they called in sick.\n\nFast forward to this year, my workplace that I've been at for 6 years knows that I have a compromised immune system, that I am not great with respiratory bugs - I got furloughed for 3 months during Covid because I'm classed as vulnerable - and we are allowed to be ill, get paid sick pay if we are.

It took 2 days to go from sore throat to chest infection, and, again,  I was unable to work for 2 weeks, something that could have been avoided if she'd stayed home instead. Silver lining to the cloud, I lost nearly a stone in weight in less than a fortnight. I got mad with them and have reduced my hours because I can't risk compromising my health to that extent, as I have other health issues to deal with daily and can't lose the income, either. My boss wouldn't pay me for more than a couple of days, I had to apply for statutory sick pay, which is less than what I'd have earned. Also, my Dad is having chemo for terminal cancer, so I had to cancel on him twice. I'm working more from home, so there's less likelihood of it happening again. It's been 5 years since I had my boosters, so maybe I need them again. For me, pertussis is my nemesis - despite having all the vaccinations and then some, on top of having had the actual disease at least 5 times in my life, my body doesn't retain any antibodies for that disease at all. Bodies are weird!", "\u201cme me me me me me me\u201d", "Well, [1:3 people who\u2019ve had Covid suffer from Long Covid symptoms,](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kids-similar-risk-long-covid-adults-study-suggests) including children, so that still sounds pretty dang dangerous to me.\n\n[One infection can cause permanent damage to immune systems](https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/covid-19-study-suggests-long-term-damage-immune-system), making you vulnerable to severe illness from anything else you come in contact with too.", "Im of the opinion that focusing on caring for your four sick kids is above worrying about the hypothetical health issues that other people might or might not have.

The point is that OP did her due diligence by keeping her kids home and isolated. Period. \n\nExpecting people to share personal health information with everyone in the neighborhood is ridiculous.

I hope chemo helps your dad for a while.\n\nHourly staff at my job have no paid time off, so of course far too many people come in sick.  That\u2019s what really made the case with my coworker so sad - the sick one Had PTO, she just didn\u2019t didn\u2019t use it because she didn\u2019t want to stay home because her husband was also sick and apparently whining at her to take care of him.\n\nWe\u2019ve been trying to get that PTO for hourly staff changed in every single higher-up meeting for over a decade now.\n\nAt least in my department we\u2019re explicitly clear that we won\u2019t ever write them up or penalize them for not coming in due to illness, as long as they tell us they\u2019ll be out.  (Telling us after the fact if it\u2019s an emergency is fine too) and they That we Want them to stay home if they\u2019re sick.

I can't imagine why people are so anti-society as to disregard how we treat others. I still wear my mask. I don't expect other people to do so, but I sure appreciate it.", "How immune compromised you are varies, as does what you are vulnerable to. I\u2019m immune compromised due to a relatively new medication so my doctors basically can\u2019t say just how compromised I am or how effective vaccination will be because there isn\u2019t a lot of data. It\u2019s not just the Covid infection itself, there is also opportunistic infection from other things that take advantage of the stuff Covid does to the immune system, like they are seeing increases risk of fungal infections.", "Not who you asked, but I've been immunocompromised for most of my life, except for a few years when my Crohn's Disease was mild enough to be treated with anti-inflammatory meds. j\n\nI've been getting a flu shot annually since I was 8 because I'm at elevated risk of the flu turning into pneumonia. I've had the flu exactly twice, and luckily it didn't progress to pneumonia in either case. \n\nEven infections that don't put me at risk for hospitalization take me much longer to get over. I had two simultaneous skin infections back in 2016, one bacterial and one fungal. The fungal responded great to topical medication, but the bacterial turned out to be systemic, so I had to take oral antibiotics. It was incredibly difficult to fight, and it took two rounds of oral antibiotics to cure.\n\nUnfortunately, the antibiotics made the fungal infection worse, to the point that parts of my skin were raw, and I lost enough hair that even 6 months later, a new hairdresser asked me about it. \n\nAnd because my infections were so bad and long-lasting, my Remicade infusion was delayed because my care team was worried about renewing my immunosuppressant while my body struggled with two infections. \n\nAnd that delay led to my body not responding to Remicade as well as before, so I had to start getting it more often, and eventually it stopped working completely. \n\nSo there's a lot going on when you're immunocompromised.", "A properly fitting n95 or equivalent mask means you can do most things in relative safety, so I have no idea what you are talking about. We don\u2019t eat in restaurants (can\u2019t wear a mask and eat) and avoid very crowded places (like where people are basically right on top of each other) but we avoided places that crowded before Covid too, so that\u2019s no change.\n\nThe point of lockdown was to keep people from being in spaces where they share air when proper masking and air filtration was not available. These things are available now. A mask (well, respirator, technically) is like taking your own little \u2018lockdown\u2019 air bubble with you.", "Hugs, love. It certainly can have devastating consequences. I left hospital nursing because of how devastating it got there. Total desperation for staff to just arrive to work. We had people die not from covid, but because we didn\u2019t have just one more nurse on the floor, or we didn\u2019t have just one more ICU bed not just here, but across the whole mid to North Atlantic region. Now I\u2019m in dialysis. The clinics are small, but a couple of them are on dialysis for life because of covid. One guy, only in his early 30s with no prior medical history, was a cop and felt just like many cops \u2014 covid wasn\u2019t real, why wear masks, yada yada. Anyway, 2 years post infection, his legs are destroyed by lymphaedema and covered in non-healing wounds, he requires an IV pump 24-7 delivering life-saving meds, his heart is severely compromised, and he\u2019s on dialysis for the rest of his life. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s the worst outcome I\u2019ve ever seen, but he\u2019s rivaled by a 33-year old mom of 5 who had coagulopathy from an asymptomatic infection when she went in for an EGD that caused bleeding and a brain injury that left her at the brink of death from a brain injury due to blood loss. Spent months learning to walk and talk with only slight success. By the time she was discharged, it was unclear if she\u2019d ever be able to meaningfully interact with her surroundings or other people again. There was another guy who got it in the early days. He was trached and vented for months, repeatedly getting this trach infection that later was established as being common for ventilated covid patients. His stay lasted months in ICU where this 27 year old healthy farm veterinarian decompensated and developed severe ulcerations in his skin, exposing bones because they went so deep. The patient was being turned and cared for appropriately, his body just wasn\u2019t building the ingredients needed to heal his skin properly. Eventually he was discharged, of course. Working inpatient, I never got to know the ends of the stories. Thank goodness for that. Some of them will be lodged in my heart forever.\n\nThis is what makes me so angry when someone gets shamed for wearing a mask. Good for them being the lucky ones. There are some fates worse than death, and covid makes them happen. Rarely, yes, but not as rarely as media has forced them to believe. I live in a RURAL area. RURAL. I\u2019d I\u2019ve met so many worst-possible outcomes in a RURAL area, then it\u2019s common enough to take precautions. What I\u2019ve gone through post-covid has been NOTHING compared to these, and other, patients I\u2019ve had. I push through because I CAN. But I do speak up.", "Sure and again, good for you, stay as healthy as possible. Point being you advised OTHERS they shouldn\u2019t stop covid precautions and behaviors. Says who? The experts don\u2019t say that. There\u2019s no mask mandate, so why exactly? Why, as a society, can we not allow others to live their life the way THEY see fit (within the bounds of law)?", "Lmao. So that\u2019s why there wasn\u2019t  a whole COVID-19 reporting system, right? OH WAIT, THERE WAS \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Even if it was Covid or the flu or another serious disease, treatment isn't given until symptoms progress. Doctors will just tell you what it is and then say call me if x happens or z gets worse. \n\nUnless you're super rich, then you can pay for all the treatment you want whenever you want.", "ah neat (in the science way not the rest of it)"]}
