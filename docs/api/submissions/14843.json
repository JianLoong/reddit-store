I realized when I got older around 12+ how it made him feel left out but he and his father never said anything. From then on I told my grandparents to not give me anything if they weren\u2019t going to give him something too. So do you know what they did? They put on their big adult pants and did just that.

If you don\u2019t want to give to both of them than that\u2019s fine but it\u2019s probably best not to give to one and not the other because you\u2019re just making it quite an uncomfortable situation for their combined family. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's not favouritism to acknowledge that you want to help your niece, but not the daughter of the woman that's married to her father.

I couldn\u2019t justify sending two kids with such similar ages to different schools (public vs. private) because of a financial contribution from family when we wanted both kids in the same private school. \n\nIs there some bad blood somewhere or just that you don\u2019t consider the step-daughter as part of the family?

I think the most tactful thing to do right now is to just leave the matter alone and save the money for your niece's college. School is important, but this could really shift their family dynamic in the worst way. Having a safe home/good relationship with family is just as important as having a good education. She's smart, she'll most likely do well no matter which highschool she goes to. IMO by insisting on this any further, you'll damage her relationship with her step sister and step mom and this could lead to guilt and stress for her. \nAnd PLEASE don't bring the kids into this and force them to make the decision or take sides (not saying you will, but the adults in my life did this to me often and it really messed me up.

The parents are in the best position to tell whether this will breed resentment between the girls, which it most likely will. Imagine living next to a sister who gets to do all these education things you want, go to the college you want, but you can't because there was no money for you.\n\nIf the stepniece feels this way, her parents are well within their rights to decline your gift on her sister's behalf. \n\nWhy don't you all just settle an equal amount of money on both girls, and let them choose what school they want to spend it on?", "Well obviously you\u2019re showing favouritism, this is your niece duh.

I just worry that one going to the nice HS and the other to the less good HS is going to set them up for potentially some pretty deepseated disparities and jealousies.

My mom experienced this situation with her own stepsister, and there are no hard feelings even though my mom\u2019s stepdad and stepsister have been in her life since she was a kid. Her stepsister\u2019s family paid her stepsister\u2019s way through an expensive university, but my grandma didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t send my mom to college. Nobody ever talks about it, there is no resentment nor animosity, and it\u2019s just one of those \u201cIt stinks but that\u2019s life situations\u201d. \n\nThere is no malice being shown by OP from what I have seen, and OP\u2019s SIL can reach out to her own extended family for help if she wants to. Nobody is asking SIL\u2019s family to fund 14yo\u2019s school fees. \n\nAll this being said, I think it seems unwise to pull college funds to pay for an \u201cexpensive\u201d high school unless the school has specific and stated ties with a college that 14yo plans to apply to. Private high schools are somewhat of a scam IMO. But that\u2019s beside the point. :p"]}
