It\u2019s totally valid, of course, but the kid has been in your lives for a decade, too. I am just nosy.\n\nETA: Yeah, I am not changing my vote, but you sound like a big asshole.

I think the most tactful thing to do right now is to just leave the matter alone and save the money for your niece's college. School is important, but this could really shift their family dynamic in the worst way. Having a safe home/good relationship with family is just as important as having a good education. She's smart, she'll most likely do well no matter which highschool she goes to. IMO by insisting on this any further, you'll damage her relationship with her step sister and step mom and this could lead to guilt and stress for her. \nAnd PLEASE don't bring the kids into this and force them to make the decision or take sides (not saying you will, but the adults in my life did this to me often and it really messed me up.

The parents are in the best position to tell whether this will breed resentment between the girls, which it most likely will. Imagine living next to a sister who gets to do all these education things you want, go to the college you want, but you can't because there was no money for you.\n\nIf the stepniece feels this way, her parents are well within their rights to decline your gift on her sister's behalf. \n\nWhy don't you all just settle an equal amount of money on both girls, and let them choose what school they want to spend it on?", "Well obviously you\u2019re showing favouritism, this is your niece duh.

The one and only thing I think it did very well that I could see many schools did not is that we had an amazing humanities curriculum that had a special way of teaching essay writing and I came into college as a very advanced writer and basically should have been able to skip my college writing requirement (although that was not allowed).

My parents started an account for all their grandkids as they were born. It is to be given to them at 25 years old. No other stipulations except they have to be 25. Why TF would I have a say over that money? My in-laws started college funds for our kids that will only be used for their education and if they don't further their education in one way or another it will be given as a down payment for a home and that's it. That is their choice as they are setting up the funds. Parents don't get to dictate where money that isn't theirs goes. As stated my in-laws started college funds for their grandkids. My oldest son isn't biologically or legally my husband's child so no there was not an account set up for him and we all 3 completely understood that (they always treated him the same at holidays and birthdays) but when he graduated they gave him a thousand dollars and when he went to college, since he is military and that paid, they gave him 5 grand towards the vehicle he was buying and paid the first year of the insurance.

My parents were not going to say no to my sister getting funding from external sources because you literally need money to get ahead, it just sucks that I also didn't have the same advantages. It's a lot to deal with and unpack when you are a child or a young adult. To have people say they view you as family but their actions show differently. OP absolutely has the ability to do whatever they want with their money, but should be aware that there are consequences that they may not even be aware of or intend.

Steps often aren\u2019t on the same level but then I bet most have other families of their own who can gift them in addition, such as their own bio-family. It\u2019s nice to think that that steps, especially those from a young age, will be considered equally family, but in my experience from both side, that\u2019s not reality.

Your brother clearly thinks both girls are his daughters, you should too. How about both girls go to regular high school and you use the college funds to help both of them out?", "I kinda lean toward ESH and it basically depends on what your brother and his family think about this. Yeah that\u2019s not your blood niece but she\u2019s been your brothers step kid for 10 years. The college fund would be one thing, because it\u2019s normal for siblings to have different plans for college, different aspirations and even different amounts of funding considering scholarships, grants, savings, loans etc. It\u2019s also normal to start saving pretty early and locking it into tax benefits for one specific purpose. But you\u2019re talking about sending two girls that are basically the same age in the same family to two different high schools. Imagine how the step niece will feel explaining that her step sister goes to the nicer school across town because her side of the family thinks she\u2019s worth the investment. I don\u2019t know what step niece\u2019s side of the family is like but I know that whatever they\u2019re like it\u2019s certainly not step-niece\u2019s fault. I am saying this as someone who grew up in a blended family where it was made extremely clear that ALL of the children, step or not, were of equal importance. My dad was raised by his step mother as her own son. She scrimped and saved to put all 4 kids through private school and there was no question that if they couldn\u2019t afford for all to go, none were going. And they also made sure their family understood that and treated their kids the same. I don\u2019t know if your brother has the same standard for his family, but if he does this would be an absolute no go. I think you need to have an honest conversation with both brother and SIL about how they want to conduct their family, and that they should have the final say in how their children are treated while under their roof.", "YTA. \n\nEveryone harping on the fact that you have no obligation to pay for anyone is absolutely correct and also completely missing the point. If you were to pay for one blood niece but not another, the same logic would apply but it would very clearly be favoritism, which would make you TA. The stepniece has been in the family for 10 years, since she was 5 years old, so unless there is some other dynamic going on here, she is just as much a part of the family as a blood niece. I have a mixed extended family as well and cannot imagine doing something like this that would clearly communicate that the step sibling is not really part of the family.", "YTA. It's definitely favoritism, the question is if favoritism is reasonable in this situation. I don't think that you're an AH for only wanting to pay for your niece per se, but you're an AH for creating a situation that is likely to cause conflict between the sisters. I can totally see your niece in 10 years accusing you of ruining their relationship because of this. But that depends on what happens next.", "If stepniece is as good as niece in school and you don't give them the same opportunities: It is favoritism.\n\nThat said it's YOUR money you do whatever you want with it", "I think this is less about being AH tbh. I think the fact you prefaced this with \"niece is super smart primary school teachers think she'll go far\" sets the bar for me to see there's more reason to this than \"niece vs stepniece\" the thing is if niece is so special she'll do well in a normal highschool. \n\nDon't quote me though I'm British and our school systems are pretty much across-the-board unless you send a kid to private school which doesn't guarantee they'll do better.", "So step-niece has been in your life for 2/3rds of her life and you basically have said she's nothing to you?  Technically(legally/morally), you don't OWE her anything(just as you don't owe your niece anything).\n\nBut it does seem unnecessarily cruel that you are unwilling to do anything for step-niece.  Of course if you've had little interaction with her.  If she's not treated you as family, that would for the most part absolve you.  BUT you don't give any qualifications here to explain why you feel she's nothing to you.\n\nWithout any mitigating circumstances(and your comments don't give any). \n\nOne person made a good comment, you are doing this while they are still at home together,  Once they are adult/off to Uni, it's a different thing, but to send niece to a private school and leave step-niece behind is rubbing her nose into the fact that you consider her inadequate and unworthy.  SO THAT MAKES YTA(yes Ass HOLE!)", "I agree. How is it showing favoritism to have developed a plan for the kid you already bonded with.

I grew up in a blended family that had kids from 3 marriages in it; some of us lived together more than others, and we all had different sets of relatives. No one expected the aunts and uncles or grandparents of another sibling to give the same presents or trips or whatever. At least once a year one kid would go on a vacation or a visit with some family who were not related to the other kids; it was fine.", "If this is specifically a 529, you as the owner can decide that they are only intended for a specific beneficiary. \n\nBut the actual financial mechanism is set up so that it\u2019s incredibly easy to move, change and rollover beneficiaries.

It'd be one thing if the step niece JUST joined the family then of course they wouldn't have a decade old fund. But she's been their niece since she was 5 and they only ever save for their bio niece.
