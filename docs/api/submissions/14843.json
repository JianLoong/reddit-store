I realized when I got older around 12+ how it made him feel left out but he and his father never said anything. From then on I told my grandparents to not give me anything if they weren\u2019t going to give him something too. So do you know what they did? They put on their big adult pants and did just that.

If you don\u2019t want to give to both of them than that\u2019s fine but it\u2019s probably best not to give to one and not the other because you\u2019re just making it quite an uncomfortable situation for their combined family. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's not favouritism to acknowledge that you want to help your niece, but not the daughter of the woman that's married to her father.

I couldn\u2019t justify sending two kids with such similar ages to different schools (public vs. private) because of a financial contribution from family when we wanted both kids in the same private school. \n\nIs there some bad blood somewhere or just that you don\u2019t consider the step-daughter as part of the family?

I think the most tactful thing to do right now is to just leave the matter alone and save the money for your niece's college. School is important, but this could really shift their family dynamic in the worst way. Having a safe home/good relationship with family is just as important as having a good education. She's smart, she'll most likely do well no matter which highschool she goes to. IMO by insisting on this any further, you'll damage her relationship with her step sister and step mom and this could lead to guilt and stress for her. \nAnd PLEASE don't bring the kids into this and force them to make the decision or take sides (not saying you will, but the adults in my life did this to me often and it really messed me up.

The parents are in the best position to tell whether this will breed resentment between the girls, which it most likely will. Imagine living next to a sister who gets to do all these education things you want, go to the college you want, but you can't because there was no money for you.\n\nIf the stepniece feels this way, her parents are well within their rights to decline your gift on her sister's behalf. \n\nWhy don't you all just settle an equal amount of money on both girls, and let them choose what school they want to spend it on?", "Well obviously you\u2019re showing favouritism, this is your niece duh. Why the heck should you be expected to pay for some kid you\u2019re not related to? \n\nNTA obviously, and make sure you pay the school directly rather than giving your brother the money.

Now they don't have to worry about Ed for OP's Niece. They can buckle down and work and save, and cash flow Step-Niece's education. OP is still doing their family a Giant Favor, and they need to take their whining over to Choosy Beggar.", "Just \"coming up before\" hardly solves the problem. If OP has put 60K Dollars, Pounds, or Euros in an Education Fund for his Niece, it takes that much to solve the problem. They also don't have a couple of decades in the stock or bond market to compound what they put in her Ed Savings account. The Problem is that Step-Nieces Mom, Dad, Grandparents, actual Aunts, and Uncles on Her side of family have not saved Anything. NTA Obviously.", "The brother wants away. It was something it sounds like to me that the 2 sisters did for their neice.", "Because you should start a college fund the month they are born?  The real mystery is why haven't the Step-Nieces Mom, Dad, and Grandparents saved anything?", "We are closer to our niece and she is the smart one", "I agree, Ivy Leagues would probably accept a few hundred from public school to meet some quota. I was assuming it was a school that specialized stem or something like that. In the state I used to live in there was a school that everyone who scored a certain percentile in math and science were invited to attend. The school was a literally pipeline to the best schools in the state, and Ivy League reps came every quarter for early admission. It was literally the easiest application I ever had to fill because they pretty much did everything for me. \n\nIf that\u2019s the opportunity that her niece would have I 100% think they should take the chance", "Unfortunately this is not just some expensive Christmas gifts which can be equally distributed between both the children. This is the question about the girl's future. Now the demand is to pay for school, next will be to pay for college? If the father can't afford school then he definitely can't afford college either. So the 14 year old should sacrifice her career so that her step sister feels fair? What about the other girl's dad or paternal or maternal extended family? Why can't they help?", "I completely agree. The aunt is nah and trying to do something nice. But, with blended families, things like this need thoroughly discusses with the parents. I wouldn't let one daughter get a full ride to college and make the other put herself through school.", "But did your brother's grandparents also do for you like yours did for him?", "It seems like there are a lot of delusional people who expect this kind of treatment. All these stories of \u201c they got money\u201d. So I DESERVE it too! OR my partners kids got a house upon graduation from their bio Grandparents, I was married into the family so I deserve a house too. and if I don\u2019t get one- I\u2019ll sue them.. \nthis type of delusional thinking needs to stop \ud83d\uded1", "> you\u2019re showing favoritism simply because one is your niece and the other isn\u2019t\n\nIsn't that a good reason for favoritism though?", "So you think because they can't afford to offer stepniece a good future my niece has to suffer?", "That\u2019s what she is\u2026.a step niece\u2026.", "They are not twins there is no reason they can't be separated", "To be fair, OP paying for something for them that they weren\u2019t going  to spend money on in the first place really doesn\u2019t affect their finances. \n\nI totally agree NTA though. OP had a plan started for their niece and that money should go to the niece.", "This 1000 percent! They should be great full for the help they are getting not demanding more!", "They can\u2019t both be smart?", "Who's choice was it that the same relationship never occurred with your step niece?\n\nEDIT as it appears you're not responding now: YTA if you've not attempted to foster the dame relationship with your step niece. NTA if you have and SIL has kept her daughter's distance from you.", "Op it doesn't matter who you think is smarter. Pay no attention to those saying YTA. You are most definitely not. You are not beholden to anyone in regards to paying for school or college fees. It's a good thing that you have done this for your niece. It may not be fair to the step daughter but hey that's life. Let it be a financial burden on the actual parents since you've taken care of the other.", "This. Completely agreed and we\u2019ll said btw. I\u2019d imagine OP started this fund very early in niece\u2019s life with the sole intention of support their niece. That shouldn\u2019t have to change because \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d", "I agree with you/ this is Not some toy- it is (as you\u2019ve said) paying her college, books, living, and than, they will be asked/told to pay for her post grad studies too. Screw that I disagrees with paying for both- what\u2019s her family doing about it- waiting for someone else to pay their bills.  Hell no! \nSorry - but my family is first,", "Step Niece has an entire family on her side. WTF are They doing?", "No: that\u2019s telling one kid you care more than another. Does SIL receive child support? Does she spend that money on both girls? Girls that are that close in age and growing up as sisters, should not be divided in this manner. It could affect their sibling relationship. \n\nPersonally, I think you can just save the money for college. I don\u2019t know the circumstances of how you ended up involved in their family\u2019s finances, but I would just leave them alone to avoid damaging their family\u2019s relationships.", "Unless the public high school is complete garbage, she's certainly not going to suffer from attending it.\n\nIt's an odd choice, IMO, to spend a college fund on a private high school unless 1) the public school truly can't meet her needs and 2) it has enough money in it to pay for both. I went to a prestigious university from a regular public high school, as did most of my college friends. Honestly, if the fund has more than enough for college, you'd be better off saving the extra for graduate school.", "Like most good parents they want to treat their kids equally and don't want one of them to get special treatment (which is the most common reason for siblings to resent each other in the future).\n\nI've read your other comments, you don't even know if step niece is \"smart\", she's been in your brother's life for a decade but you seem to know nothing about her. Your brother sees her as his daughter but you obviously don't share his feelings that she is in fact family.\n\nYou can do other things for your niece, like the college fund. But right now, when the girls still live at home you have to respect that your brother and his wife wants them to have the same opportunitites in life. So consider that when you offer to do special things for your niece. Otherwise you will risk your relationship with your brother (and then even possibly with the niece too).", "She is in the family for the majority of her life.\nIt's really weird how she will not be accepted the same way.", "Do you mean conjoined twins? Twins can go to different places", "Omg you are setting up the foundation for some major siblings issues no parents want to del with it for the next 40 years", "I don't know if she is smart her mom can send her to that school", "I mean potentially\u2026but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. According to OP ofc (they could be bias)", "Why do tou favor your child over someone else's child? That favoritism and not fair", "I think you're forgetting that OP is being generous given that it's not their responsibility to provide a college fund for their niece in the first place. Frankly it's damn right selfish and greedy to ask them to provide for another person.", "She is just ordinary not smart like my niece so I DO know her\n\nAnd like a good aunt I want my niece to have the best of everything also my brother is ok with accepting the money for my niece's school", "Lol... I just spit out my coffee... \n\nAs a Mom of twins... I can confirm you are 100% correct.", "OP is not smart like their niece.", "You\u2019d do well to be cautious about making statements like who the smart one is and who the pretty one is and the like. It\u2019s a significant social issue for young women and can lead to rivalries and broken relationships. But yeah idk why you\u2019d have to pay for her school either. A lot of schools have scholarships, maybe one or the other would be able to get one to lower the cost and make it kind of a 2 for 1 tho", "You are very kind to have set up a college found for your nice but with that \u2018she is the smartest one\u2019 maaaan if you are an AH. Smart people can apply also to scholarship. Private schools loooove to have super smart kids to bump their stats and college admissions. HS also offers long term scholarship compared to younger grades.", "That example compares kids who are not siblings or related.", "Oh, I completely agree that B/SIL are out of line. They just aren\u2019t here asking about their behavior\u2026\n\nMy point is more rooted in the sibling relationship. It\u2019s hard for teens to rise above something like this. When OP provides for one instead of both, the relationship between the girls is altered forever. Please don\u2019t misunderstand-I have no issue with sending the girls to 2 different schools or their respective costs (see my original comment), but now that it\u2019s clear that OP views these girls as one family member and one not (when they consider themselves family members) the relationship will be damaged. \n\nI understand OP\u2019s generosity. I\u2019ve set aside a full college fund for my 3 year old niece also. That\u2019s why I think OP is just better off keeping the money for college instead of earmarking some for HS. HSs don\u2019t make that much of a difference anyway.", ">I don't know if she is smart her mom can send her to that school\n\nYour story is all over the place because this is what you said in another comment.\n\nAnd in your initial post you told how your brother said they couldn't afford the other school for the girls but you think his wife can pay for step nieces schooling?\n\nYou're causing problems here, your wording about how niece will \"suffer\" if she can't go to the other school. You're bullying your brother into accepting the money and giving special treatment to one of his daughters. This isn't a small thing like them not getting exactly the same gifts for christmas, this is public school versus private school. Which is a mich bigger issue. I went to private school when my siblings went to a public one. But I was accepted because I had excellent grades and our parents could afford to send all of us to the school of our choice. So it wasn't about the money. But in this situation it IS about the money. You're causing problems for your brother and his family here. They have been a family unit for a decade but you're trying to sabotage that. Do you even like his wife and step daughter?", "It skips a generation"]}
