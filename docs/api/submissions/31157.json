Seasonal clothing for child that age only fit correctly for one year, two at most. \n\nShe\u2019s also not only the primary parent but also spends small amounts of time with your child. Things that feel instinctual to you are things/habits she hasn\u2019t needed to learn. \n\nRegardless of all that, if you had informed her that she needed to buy/have clothing and she didn\u2019t then she would be at fault here. Instead you surprised her, using your child as a tool to teach your ex a lesson.\n\nI\u2019m on your side when it comes to being disappointed that your son\u2019s things come back home missing and disorganized. It absolutely shows a lack of thoughtlessness and care. This isn\u2019t a vacation with minimal access to a laundry room. Does she have a washer and dryer?\n\nThat being said, if your ex is thoughtless when it comes to your son\u2019s things then you need to protect your son from that thoughtless.

Fair or not your son is the be who suffers if you don\u2019t step up.\n\nBefore his next visit let your ex know what she needs to buy and the sizes in a email/text so you have confirmation she received it and follow it up after the trip to have a record of whether she did or didn\u2019t get him necessities.

Whether he believes that or not is irrelevant, it's still an inappropriate, uncomfortable position for him to be in, and you're directly contributing to that. \n\nAnd why in tf is she not paying child support??

As others have pointed out it\u2019s normal to return from travel with dirty laundry, and dealing with it is part of the homecoming ritual. You shouldn\u2019t be sending expensive electronics with a traveling 7 year old (or younger if the loss happened a few years ago), so those lost games are on you as much as her.  \n\nIf you want to scale back how much you pack for your kid, that\u2019s fine! A single change of clothes plus extra underwear would make sense, to cover him if he ends up stuck somewhere in transit or other mishap.

By not giving the kid some clothing you denied him the comfort and familiarity of wearing his own clothes in a place away from home. This would have caused me all kinds of stress as a kid.
