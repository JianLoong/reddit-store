Seasonal clothing for child that age only fit correctly for one year, two at most. \n\nShe\u2019s also not only the primary parent but also spends small amounts of time with your child. Things that feel instinctual to you are things/habits she hasn\u2019t needed to learn. \n\nRegardless of all that, if you had informed her that she needed to buy/have clothing and she didn\u2019t then she would be at fault here. Instead you surprised her, using your child as a tool to teach your ex a lesson.\n\nI\u2019m on your side when it comes to being disappointed that your son\u2019s things come back home missing and disorganized. It absolutely shows a lack of thoughtlessness and care. This isn\u2019t a vacation with minimal access to a laundry room. Does she have a washer and dryer?\n\nThat being said, if your ex is thoughtless when it comes to your son\u2019s things then you need to protect your son from that thoughtless.

Whether he believes that or not is irrelevant, it's still an inappropriate, uncomfortable position for him to be in, and you're directly contributing to that. \n\nAnd why in tf is she not paying child support??

As others have pointed out it\u2019s normal to return from travel with dirty laundry, and dealing with it is part of the homecoming ritual. You shouldn\u2019t be sending expensive electronics with a traveling 7 year old (or younger if the loss happened a few years ago), so those lost games are on you as much as her.  \n\nIf you want to scale back how much you pack for your kid, that\u2019s fine! A single change of clothes plus extra underwear would make sense, to cover him if he ends up stuck somewhere in transit or other mishap.

If his clothes are mostly coming back unwashed, things are missing etc then maybe his life at his mother's isn't as stable as it is with you (or maybe his Mum gets him to pack his own back and doesn't check it). If the only stability you can give him during the time with his Mum is helping him pack his bag and making sure he has everything he may want or need while there, then you need to suck it your irritation for the sake of your son.\n\nMy (29f) parents split when I was 18months old, I was almost always living out of a bag until I bought a house with my bf at 25yrs. I haaaated living out of a bag/bags, never feeling like I could get too settled anywhere because I'd be gone again in a few days. Knowing I'd likely leave something important behind and have to go back for it, making it take even longer for me to be able to get settled until the cycle started again.\n\nWhen I was in primary school I didn't want to bother anyone so if my parents had put out my clothes for the day and didn't include underwear, then I wouldn't wear any that day. If I ran out of clothes at my Dad's (I lived with Mum mostly) then you can guarantee that I wouldn't go to my Dad and ask for more clothes or let him know what I was missing, I would just take dirty clothes out of the wash pile and put them back on. I have ADHD so not sure if this was anything to do with that or being an insecure child that desperately didn't want to annoy anyone.\n\nAs I got older and I was able to pack my own bag, obviously I had everything I needed, and I'm pretty sure my parents would talk me through the list of things to double check I'd packed it.

As I got older and grew less he started buying me more clothes so I could take some home with me. At no point during this decade, did he ever complain about having to provide me with clothes.

Unless you know for a fact that she has the ability to immediately go out and get him a couple outfits and something to sleep in, he just might be wearing the same clothes for several days.

Their mom didn't have a washing machine, the nearest town with a laundromat was ten miles away, and she didn't have a car.

Sometimes it's not the \"fairness\" of a thing, but the effect it has on someone else, that should drive our decisions.  \n\nAnd oh-- just stop with that whole \"buy 'em big for next year thing\" already.  I had to have several surgeries on my arm as it grew because my grandma shared this philosophy.  At six years old I fell down the stairs and broke my arm in four places because my pants--already too long and rolled up as it was--fell down and tripped me.  Plus I looked stupid wearing clothes that didn't fit--and I know this because people both children and adults told me so.  Don't do this to your son.  Not only at her home, but at YOUR home too.

Yes, you want to make sure your kid is good to go, but you also get sick and tired of throwing money away or not being able to plan. \n\nI went through this for many years with my ex, until our child hit adulthood. I eventually started adding a typed list of items that were packed for our child. The list was in an envelope with a note to the other parent each time. Our child knew to hand the note off to them upon arrival. A backup list was packed into a pocked of the suitcase. It was up to our child and the other parent to ensure everything made it home using the list. \n\nYes, some things still didn\u2019t make it here and there, but it drastically altered the situation for the better moving forward. As for wrinkled or dirty clothing, I don\u2019t ever mind that. It\u2019s just a load of laundry, and at least it made it home!\n\nWe are back in this situation while caring for our nephew part-time. It\u2019s a long story, but we often end up having to pick him up to stay with us for multiple nights with near zero warning. His mother cannot get herself together enough to pack for his stays. We typically have only what he showed up in. \n\nWe have been buying him full wardrobes each year for the last few years, since his mom got him back from foster care. Unfortunately, we end up sending him home in \u2018our\u2019 outfits and he shows back up in clothes that are too small/stained/damaged/smell like cat pee/etc. to continue using. That means we don\u2019t send him back in them (we typically take him to school and she picks him up when visits are over, again often with very little notice). We are already down to only one pair of the five new pants we bought him recently. We have one other pair that is too small. \n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of supplementing her in this way. She spends nearly no time with him, so she buys his love with expensive gaming systems and computers instead of clothes. She knows we won\u2019t let him go without these things, so she won\u2019t step up. \n\nThe best way to handle this, if your ex is someone you can communicate well with, is to do just that: communicate. Don\u2019t be mean about it, but let them know the issue and come to a compromise that works for everyone. If that won\u2019t work, then keep letting her live in the bed she has made. In our situation, there is little hope, but that\u2019s not always the case (as demonstrated with my child\u2019s other parent). \n\nOne last thing: If you go with the list, be sure to explain that she will be paying the cost to replace any missing items upon your child\u2019s return.

There are things you put aside for your child. Stop being petty. So what if the clothes come back wrinkled and dirty? You would have re washed them anyway, right? My youngest is now 34 years old.

I stopped allowing the switch to leave, but I got him books. \n\nMy solution about the clothes was to get a couple cheap sets of clothes that are his travel clothes and he only takes those over there. None of his expensive stuff goes since I don't want it getting torn up or disappearing into his half brother's room. \n\nSo NTA to me, but there are solutions without putting your son in the middle.

The kid is still in 5T clothing. There's also tons of second hand shops that sell children's clothing as well as FB where some people are willing to give things for free. It's not like the kid needs a ton of clothing but to not even have one or two pairs of pants or a couple of shirts, is crazy. If she's not even trying to provide the basic necessities, like clothing for her kid than maybe the custody agreement needs changing.
