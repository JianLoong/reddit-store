Of course we were all elated for a free vacation. My in-laws are calling it out \u201clast hoorah\u201d since my sister in law is pregnant and we are planning on getting pregnant soon also. However I became less excited when I found out about our sleeping arrangements. My in-laws explained to all of us that they had booked the basic cabins (no windows, usually just a bed, a bathroom, a small tv and maybe a desk) we were all fine with that as they weren\u2019t as expensive leaving more money to pay for drinks and excursions (which my in-laws also graciously volunteered to pay for) however they then said as another way to save money me and my husband were to share a room with them while my sister in law and her husband had their own room since she\u2019s 4 months pregnant. This immediately made me upset with the fact that for two weeks I\u2019ll have to share a small room with my in-laws having no privacy with my husband during our vacation. \n\nBut that isn\u2019t even the worst of it because we were then told the room consists of two twin/single beds. It\u2019s outrageous and comical to me the fact that these people expect me and my husband to sleep in a small bed because it saves money and in their words were both \u201csmall\u201d whatever that means. I didn\u2019t say anything to my in-laws because I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful but as soon as we got home I shared my distress with my husband. He said he was fine with it since we will barely spend a lot of time in the cabins anyway and I was overreacting.

It is likely one queen bed (for the in laws) and then two twin beds that are bunk-beds.  That's how most cruise ships operate.\n\nYou can, of course, volunteer to pay your own way for this vacation.", "NTA. That room was not designed for 4 adults and you shouldnt have to feel uncomfortable on vacation. However, I would suggest you compromise and pay the difference to get you and your husband your own room.", "NTA. I went on a cruise with husband and his family. We had our own cabin, although it was also an inside, windowless room. We had a full sized bed, but those rooms are tiny! Believe me- you will hate it, they will hate it!  Just imagine all of you trying to dress, shower, etc.", "No way, I would nope right out of that trip. NTA!", "NTA OP for how you feel.  You can always decline or see about paying for your own room.  Cruise ships don't over book rooms, a twin bed counts as one passenger.  You most likely have a double bed for the in-laws and possibly bunk beds for you and your wife.  If you know the ship and room number you can always look up photos and more information online.  From experience I can tell you it will be a tight fit.  I do know people who have traveled like this and they have utilized the spa or gym areas for showing etc.", "NTA. One twin bed for two adults? That's beyond being cheap.\n\nI would just politely decline to join the trip and wish them well on their vacation. Or, if you really want to still go, book your own separate room on the same cruise and pay for it yourself.", "NTA\n\nI'd \"nope\" my way out of that vacation. Important to note that everyone has their own way of dealing with needed downtime. If you need a bit of solitude, you wouldn't get it for two weeks.", "Nta. It would make a lot more sense to book a shorter cruise with enough beds.\n\nWould the cruise line even allow four adults to share a room with two twin beds? I'm doubting it.", "I think you are likely misinformed. No cruise line is putting 4 people in an interior room with 2 twin beds. I\u2019ve seen interior rooms with 1 queen (two twins pushed together), two twins, or 2 twins/1 queen + berths that can be opened up. Now I still wouldn\u2019t agree to this because that will be very tight quarters for 4 adults for 2 weeks. Most people use this configuration for parents with children. I wouldn\u2019t go unless they\u2019ll allow you to book your own room.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Don't do it. Spring for the cost of your own room. Don't you want to have privacy, and, um, intimacy on your vacation?", "Honestly, a part of me can't help but wonder if they really just wanted to take your SIL and husband on a babymoon and figured you'd nope out of being crammed into an inhospitable cabin and stay home?  Suggest getting an appropriate number of cabins for a shorter cruise to keep the costs down.", "Under no circumstances would I share a room with my in-laws for two weeks. Thank them for the offer and decline. NTA.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine the legal capacity/occupancy of that room can be more than two people, with only two twin beds in it.", "NTA. Two weeks is A LOT. What happens when everyone is getting changed for dinner? What happens if two of four need to use the bathroom at the same time? How much longer will it take to get showered and stuff? And beyond that, expecting two grown adults to share a twin bed isn\u2019t fair. No one is going to be comfortable. You\u2019re going to be tired and unhappy and it\u2019ll make the trip memorable in just a bad way. Can you offer to pay for a different cabin, or the difference in cabins?", "There\u2019s not a cruise company that would allow 4 adults in a room with 2 twin beds, family has gone on more cruises then I can count, tried before to have a room like that, doesn\u2019t happen", "NTA - Tell them profusely that while appreciative of their generosity, you'll have to decline for the reasons you already stated.  It just isn't going to work for you.  Or maybe you can pay for another room by yourselves if an option?", "NTA\nYou couldn't get me in a suite shared with my in-laws, never mind a twin room.  Are you  even sure ye are actually invited? I can't imagine a cruise where they will allow 4 adults to share two twin beds.", "NTA. Pass on vacation. You will be miserable.  2 people in a single bed\n You won't sleep well. Tired all time. Pissed off because you can't even walk in room\n 14 days laundry wirh smells. Getting ready to do anything like go to dinner\n It is a garentee disaster that will change relationships for a long time. Won't work", "NTA, and I would nope out of this vacation without even considering paying for myself. I won't want to spend this amount of time in close confines of the ship with in-laws who think it's ok to infringe on our intimacy. If they'd just said \"pay for yourself if you want bigger room\" - fair, but this is either passive-aggressive hint to pay for yourself, or just rude. Basically they've booked the trip for two couples, not three, I can take a hint when I'm not welcome.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd demand to look at the layout of the room, because what should be happening is two twins that can be pushed together and a sofa bed and bunks that can be pulled down.  Still tight and frankly not conductive to romance...\n\nEither stay home or pony up for an extra cabin.", "NTA.\n\n\"Husband, do you want to have no sex for 2 weeks on vacation?\" Start there and see where that goes.  Also, that's laughable in terms of the beds, I'm sure the cruise doesn't allow that kind of occupancy and they must have lied.  You and your husband need your own cabin, period, or don't go.", "NTA If you can't immediately book your own room, that's a firm no. From you. If yr husband chooses to go that's his business. The 2 wks sharing tht cabin would be my description of hell.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA for how you feel.  Decline the trip completely or spring for your own room.", "NTA - that room is too small for 4 adults and I would politely decline to go on the vacation, if you can't afford to pay for a room yourself. But with that being said, I do think you would be an asshole if you tried to demand an additional room from them.", "NTA", "NTA - cabins are typically tiny. And you clearly won\u2019t be getting pregnant on the cruise \u2026.", "NTA.  I\u2019d let them know that did not sound like a vacation at all, but a nightmare!   Who would even consider doing that?  Will the cruise company even allow that?  Sounds like your in-laws are planning on you and your hubby being stowaways.", "NTA\nThose are accommodations for two couples, not three. Do not try to share a room with your in-laws. And a small cruise cabin for two whole weeks!?! \n\nYour husband is too quick to say it's fine. Your cabin is the ONLY space that's private. Changing and bathing would be a nightmare. You'll spend the whole trip smelling 4 people's poop from the tiny bathroom. God forbid one of the four is a slow morning pooper, while the other 3 wait their turns. There won't even be room to sit except on the beds. Where would you lay out your next outfit? Hang your wet towels? \"We'll hardly spend any time in the cabin\" makes as much sense as \"We don't need a bathroom. How much time do we spend in the bathroom every day? Maybe an hour? We won't even miss it@\"", "NTA. Respectfully decline this vacation. I went on a 4 day cruise with hubby and teen son. If I had better swimming skills, I would have swam home. The rooms are so small, the bathroom isn\u2019t big enough to change clothes in. I bet the parents get up at 5am, and go to bed at 8pm. I can\u2019t see four adults in that area. Good luck, if you go please tell us how it went.", "NTA. Can you spring for a room of your own?", "Pay for your own Cabin Then?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank them, and don't go with them.", "YTA - you say no to the trip then.  You have no right to complain about the free accommodations.", "YTA\n\nI guarantee you are not understanding everything,  there will be sleeping accommodations for 4, you just won\u2019t like them.\n\nYou can buy your own room if you don\u2019t like the arrangements.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As others have said, I don't believe there's only two twin beds, but more likely bunks for you and your husband like you were children. But tell them no. Pay for your own room, but definitely not.

Why isn't anyone else psyched about a free vacation?\n\nSure, I'd prefer to have my own room, but if my in-laws offered an all expense paid, super fun vacation (even with non-ideal sleeping arrangements) then I'd totally go and have an absolute blast! \n\nI grew up with camping vacations because that's what my parents could afford... We had to use a flashlight to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night!  I've lived in a tiny apartment in NYC -- turns out, I really don't need that much room.  I've traveled in hostels in Japan and Europe, including sleeping in bunk rooms with strangers in the other bunks -- it was an adjustment but totally fine.  I've also been on two cruises -- essentially I was only in my cabin to sleep / shower and the rest of the time I was on having fun on the boat or excursions.
