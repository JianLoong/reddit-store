What she said was passive-aggressive, but you refusing to help your father is also passive-aggressive.  \n\n\nAn 8 hour flight and a 9 month old is plenty of reason to not travel for a wedding, but maybe re-think helping your father with his speech - don't let him feel inadequate over his language just bc your old friend is an AH. But dont go to the wedding if thats ultimately what you want to do.", "I feel like I\u2019m trying to navigate someone else\u2019s culture and that makes this a tough call, but if your whole family is involved in the wedding I would imagine your absence wouldn\u2019t cause a giant familial rift. NAH you always are within rights to be too sick (of them) to attend.", "Nta. You have a baby and you live far a way. The very least of faye\u2019s was to give you a personal invitation", "NTA. PERIOD.", "NTA.  Nobody\u2019s stopping the rest of them from being friends with each other.  If your lack of participation is enough to ruin things, even when you\u2019ve got perfectly valid non-Faye related reasons for not going anyway, they really need to examine just how strong the bond was to begin with.", "I don't think you'd be the asshole. You have a bad relationship with Faye, and you don't seem to talk to Jonah all that much either, even if that wasn't true, you're not obligated to attend their wedding.", "NTA\u2014why bother going to something that is emotional draining?", "NTA. If Jonah wants you at his wedding, he can invite you himself. Or if word of mouth from family is part of the tradition, why didn\u2019t Jonah\u2019s *mother* call and invite you? That half-assed second hand invitation to catch an 8 hour flight with a baby feels like a slap in the face. Maybe this is a cultural thing but why are your mother and the groom\u2019s mother claiming you\u2019re putting a divide between the families?  Are you by any chance being \u2018punished\u2019 because you live so far away?", "NTA. Why would you go somewhere you weren\u2019t invited to go?", "NTA\n\nAn invitation is not a demand. That's a long trip for a wedding, especially with a baby. Just because your parents and brother are there, doesn't mean you also have to be there. \n\nWhat you need to decide is if you have a close enough relationship with the groom and his mother to put aside any hard feelings about Faye. It isn't Faye's wedding so this isn't about her. You don't really have to interact with her beyond being civil. \n\nThere are no wrong answers here.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA. But don't take it out on your dad. Be the better person and help him write the speech. I would think that YTA if you don't help him. As you said, English isn't his first language. You would be doing your father the favor and Jonah, not her.", "Yes, you are the a-hole if you are using the excuse to not go because you did not receive a \"personal invitation.\"\n\nIf you don't want to go to the wedding of a frenemy's younger brother, especially when said frenemy treated you terribly, you blocked her for 2 years from social media, and then really did not keep in great contact with her brother, the groom, and the mother . . . then do NOT.  But don't use the excuse of not getting an invitation personally.  It makes you look petty and immature.\n\nIt sounds like there is resentment, sadness, and perhaps a bit of jealousy that your family is so close to Jonah and his family, and you are no longer in that loop.  Either use the opportunity to build back the bridges with people you care about (Jonah, his mother, etc.), or use it as the opportunity to set more permanent boundaries.  In either case, make sure that you know what you decide has nothing to do with a piece of paper . . . an invitation . . . or a phone call . . . or lack thereof.", "An invitation is not a summons, and, you didn't even get one by my standards.  I don't know your culture's standards, and I'm trying to stop knee jerk reacting to scenarios happening outside of my culture.  Especially regarding \"(They are technically her guests as in our culture the parents and siblings of the people getting married will also have a number of guests they can invite)\"\n\nHowever, an invitation is not a summons still stands.   Taking a 9 month old on an 8 hour flight, twice, sounds like hell to me.  Leaving a 9 month old home while you travel for a week is also difficult to a new mom.\n\n\"despite doing a lot for the family over the years + 30 year friendship between our families\"\n\nWhile it's clear your family knows and helps each other a lot over the years...\n\n\"Faye heaped a lot of abuse on me\"\n\nForget her.
