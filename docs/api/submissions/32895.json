Maybe she can have another small party with just relatives that Aiden can come to.", "NTA. She shouldn't feel forced to include him and really grandma's efforts are misplaced - quite possibly Aiden would be and feel out of place. \n\nI think the answer here is to let your step daughter have the party she wants and arrange something separate and small for her with her cousin, like a hangout (playdate?) or other little outing, like a trip to the movies or whatever they might like to do together, in honor of her birthday. Then, since he is evidently excited to celebrate with her, he gets that chance and isn't forgotten entirely from festivities, and it doesn't have to disrupt the plan for the party.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter should have the party, and guest list, that she wants. \n\nGrandma can say her piece about it, but it doesn\u2019t need to be actioned on. \n\nGood opportunity for Aiden to learn that not everyone gets invited to everything every time.", "NTA\n\nShe knows what she wants and she wants an all girl party. Nothing else needs to be said.", "NTA \n\nThis sounds like a grandma issue. I very much doubt Aiden even cares.", "NTA at all. It's her party. She can have whoever she wants there.", "NTA - But I would consider doing something separately for her and her cousin as well.", "NTA. If Grandma is super concerned about Aiden, she can have a separate event with boys and girls.  Or, she can host a small family only birthday party.  That she can be in charge of.  And pay for.", "NTA, leave her have the party she wants, can't you have grandma and nephew over for birthday cake a different day or something? NTA", "Grandma can host a family party if she\u2019s so worried about the nephew. NTA", "NTA. It is her party and she should get to choose the guests.  Sometimes people get left out for various reasons.   Same as a bridal shower does not usually include men.  More than likely there will come a time when the boy has an all boy event she won\u2019t be included in.   It does go both ways.", "Boys do gymnastics and at that age sleepovers with boys and girls is not an issue. Also if it was a makeup party and Aiden still wanted to come, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\n\"This is a damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation for you.  Do you insist on Aiden, upsetting your daughter?  Do you respect your daughter's choice, upsetting Aiden and your grandmother (and possibly other family too)?\n\nI don't think you're an ahole and I do think you should ultimately abide by your daughter's choice but your daughter needs to understand that this choice does have future consequences.  For example, her grandmother may not come to her party and Aiden may not invite her to his in the future or want to be around her either.\n\nMaybe see if you can have a family dinner that includes the grandmother and Aiden with cake as a compromise?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
