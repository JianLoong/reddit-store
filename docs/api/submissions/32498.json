The \"He said he didn't want them and I could keep them\" is what sealed the NTA for me.", "NTA, it's really sad, but it seems like he's fine with giving up pet parenthood. You don't owe him anything when it comes to the pets. I think a courtesy text letting him know when it's happening might be nice, but certainly not necessary.\n\nI'm sorry that he cheated on you and bailed so quickly, that's devastating- and I'm really sorry that your dog is so sick and that medical expenses are so expensive. \ud83d\ude14 Hoping the best for you and the dogs.", "NTA. Frankly, he doesn\u2019t deserve to be there. He literally abandoned the dogs and said he didn\u2019t want them. So be it.", "NTA. Those aren't his dogs anymore.", "NTA but seriously why are you still talking to him? Cut your losses and be done. My ex was a bum and I ended up supporting him financially for a full year before I called it quits and took our cats with me. He promised to pay me back the thousands in bills, rent, groceries, vet bills (one of our cats had some health issues) that we were supposed to split but he made me pay for on my own. As much as it hurt me financially I made the decision to block him on everything and be done for the sake of my mental health. It sucks but it gets better and you deserve so much better.", "I'm so sorry for your poor pup's troubles. But, NTA. You aren't sharing anything having to do with your dog right now. So, why would you extend yourself for his sake should the dog require end of life care?\n\nIts not that I think he doesn't deserve to be there. I just think that you're already overwhelmed and operating independently, and you shouldn't have the stress of comforting him too when he's not making himself available in any way to help you. If he disagreed with you and thought the dog should only receive palliative care and not a $10,000 treatment plan, he should have at least been direct and honest about that part.", "NTA. You gave him opportunities to still be involved with the dogs and he\u2019s pretty much told you he has no interest in that. Those aren\u2019t his dogs anymore. Save screenshots of any texts where he said he didn\u2019t want to take the dogs or pay for any of their care plus reciepts for anything you pay for in case he tries to say they\u2019re his dogs and you didn\u2019t have permission to have it put down or something.\n\nI\u2019d stop reaching out to him about any of this unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. I know there\u2019s like a weird pressure to be the chill, mature, holds no grudges ex girlfriend in a breakup, but the dude cheated on you and then bailed on you with no warning like a coward and it sounds like he\u2019s pretty much moved on. I think you\u2019ve done enough and going forward you don\u2019t owe him any more courtesy than he\u2019s given you. If he wants to stay involved in any way he needs to make the effort himself.", "Do whatever you think would be best for the dog.", "INFO - Will the dog remember him at your \"far down the road\" time? Would his presence comfort the dog?\n\n\"I would love to have him there\", if his presence would comfort the dog and you want him there, let him know and see if he shows up for this.\n\nIt almost sounds like there isn't really a conflict about the dog, you're kinda checking in with Reddit to see how mad you are supposed to be and if doing anything nice for your ex is \"AITA acceptable\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
