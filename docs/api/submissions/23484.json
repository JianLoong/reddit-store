I appreciated the help so I didn\u2019t need to worry about it during the last stressful weeks of university.\n\nI have been vegan for 6 years and my parents are ok with it at this point, but not thrilled by any means. When we have family dinners my parents usually cook meat for everyone and I either cook up some meat substitute from their freezer (they keep some for when I visit, which is nice) or I just bring my own meal. They have a handful of times cooked an entirely vegan meal for everyone. They can make great vegan stuff, though they think it\u2019s a bit trickier and don\u2019t know many recipes.\n\nI tend to try to avoid talking about veganism with my family since I don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable and I\u2019d rather focus on the things we have in common when we hang out. We\u2019ve had some conversations about it though and they know that seeing meat makes me sad and think about the death of the animals, but again, I don\u2019t tend to remind them of this regularly since I don\u2019t want to be rude or be a party pooper.\n\nWhen my parents offered to host my graduation dinner, I assumed that they would understand that I wanted the whole meal to be vegan. But at the graduation dinner, I notice my mom preparing meat in the kitchen. I asked her if they were gonna serve meat tonight and she said yes, and the plan was to give me some frozen falafels and vegan burgers like I usually eat at our family dinners. It made me sad that I was getting ready-made things from the freezer when everyone else got a home cooked meal at a dinner that was supposed to celebrate me, and I told her that. My mother was very apologetic and started to prepare falafels and burgers to everyone, putting the meat aside. She said that they hadn\u2019t thought much of it since I usually don\u2019t complain when they eat meat and I got freezer stuff. I thought the explanation was a bit weird but I appreciated her trying to fix things and calmed down.\n\nThen my dad got into the kitchen and my mom explained to him what had happened. He got defensive about it and wasn\u2019t apologetic at all. We had a bit of an argument and I started to cry. My sisters saw this and both chimed in, saying that they also thought it was weird. My dad just got quiet and gave up. The rest of the evening was nice but I could tell my dad was in a bad mood.\n\nThe next day my dad calls me up and wants to talk about the dinner. He said that what happened was my fault, I can\u2019t expect people to read my mind and that he was just focused on trying to get food on the table and didn\u2019t think about my veganism. This just made me more sad because I didn\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong, but I\u2019m starting to think that he may be right and can\u2019t expect non-vegans to understand that something like this would make me upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed formatting", "created_utc": 1690722151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dl3jg/aita_for_assuming_my_parents_would_cook_vegan/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was to celebrate you, why wouldn't they put some effort into making food that everyone will love, but ESPECIALLY you. There are a lot of delicious, meat free foods out there. I'm a solid omnivore, but there are vegetarian and vegan means that are spectacularly delicious. I rarely use meat substitutes, because I've always found THOSE disappointing (usually a texture thing - but I have sensory issues, so that probably explains it), but veggies  and beans and spices and sauces and YUM.  \n\n\nCongrats on the graduation, by the way!", "They didn\u2019t have to make the entire meal vegan, but to expect you to eat frozen falafels at your own celebration was super shitty.

You\u2019ve been vegan for years, so your parents should know your dietary needs and preferences by now. It\u2019s a dinner celebrating you, so they could have at least tried making you a homecooked vegan meal instead of premade/frozen foods. That would be like your family celebrating your birthday with a store-bought cake that you couldn\u2019t eat. Your mom at least tried to make amends, but your dad acted like a real jerk. Congrats on graduating! Don\u2019t let your dad\u2019s crappy attitude ruin your accomplishment.", "NTA It is a dinner celebration for a vegan. So let's cook meat and give the vegan pre-made frozen vegan food. Hmmm right\n\nI dont feel like it is a stretch at all to assume they would cook something actually vegan for the vegan celebrant.", "Congratulations on graduation first of all.\n\nHowever, YTA\u2026. Because you didn\u2019t mention or ask if the graduation meal could be vegan. You assume that they would and honestly given how you mentioned previous dinners went, it\u2019s normal it\u2019s went that way.\n\nYour choice of lifestyle is your choice, however you cannot expect people to know what you wanted without letting them know. Your dad\u2019s reaction is normal specially if he is just thinking of providing a nice dinner for the family.", "NTA, the meal was supposed to be a celebration for your own achievement. It is supposed to be about YOU. It's supposed to be according to your own wishes.

You both made bad assumptions here and you\u2019re dads right they aren\u2019t mind readers. He just could have gone about it differently. Your mom sounds like a good rational person and was the only one that took responsibility for her poor assumptions and took action to correct it.", "NAH except maybe OP\u2019s dad. It just sounds like a lack of communication, mom was basing food on the precedent of what usually happens at family dinners and quickly changed, but OP could maybe have talked to her in advance?\n\nI think for most people it would be normal to plan a menu around the person being celebrated, but each family has their own dynamic, and maybe they saw it as eating together was the important part, not what the food actually was.\n\nEither way, congratulations on graduating!", "ESH. You for making an assumption. Your dad for overreacting. The only person who has done right is your mom. That said - this is not a capital case.

The dinner was solely to celebrate my graduation, we had a similar thing for my sister a few years back. But I find your comment about \"people assume the usual way\" interesting because maybe that is the source of my misunderstanding with my parents. Maybe they did put this into the category of \"family dinner\" but I put it in the \"special celebration\", like a birthday or similar. Since I became a vegan I've hosted my own birthday dinners just to not be difficult and make my parents go out of their way to cook vegan food. They still host both of my sisters birthdays and they always get the food they request. So I suppose there isn't really a framework on how to do a \"special celebration\" for me, until now.  \n\n\nMy parents never asked me what I wanted to eat for the dinner so I guess that should've been a hint to me that I should speak up. I honestly thought about asking them to serve all vegan food but I thought they would be offended by the question, it has happened to me before with other people.", "It wasn't any regular family dinner.. it was a celebration meal for her success...", "That party was arranged for her and they should have prepared vegan food", "It\u2019s all about communication, like you mentioned your sisters get the food they request for their bdays, the main word here is request. \n\nAgain as you said your parents have been used to normal family dinners with you than celebrations so they don\u2019t know you want vegan food only for your celebrations. When you host they would assume it\u2019s normal since u don\u2019t cook meat. \n\nWhat I find is once you assume someone will know or understand, that how misunderstandings happen. People rarely get what the other mean so that how these situations happen. Best to say it out load cause then it\u2019s clear to everyone and if they disregard you it\u2019s on them:"]}
