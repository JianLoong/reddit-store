I appreciated the help so I didn\u2019t need to worry about it during the last stressful weeks of university.\n\nI have been vegan for 6 years and my parents are ok with it at this point, but not thrilled by any means. When we have family dinners my parents usually cook meat for everyone and I either cook up some meat substitute from their freezer (they keep some for when I visit, which is nice) or I just bring my own meal. They have a handful of times cooked an entirely vegan meal for everyone. They can make great vegan stuff, though they think it\u2019s a bit trickier and don\u2019t know many recipes.\n\nI tend to try to avoid talking about veganism with my family since I don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable and I\u2019d rather focus on the things we have in common when we hang out. We\u2019ve had some conversations about it though and they know that seeing meat makes me sad and think about the death of the animals, but again, I don\u2019t tend to remind them of this regularly since I don\u2019t want to be rude or be a party pooper.\n\nWhen my parents offered to host my graduation dinner, I assumed that they would understand that I wanted the whole meal to be vegan. But at the graduation dinner, I notice my mom preparing meat in the kitchen. I asked her if they were gonna serve meat tonight and she said yes, and the plan was to give me some frozen falafels and vegan burgers like I usually eat at our family dinners. It made me sad that I was getting ready-made things from the freezer when everyone else got a home cooked meal at a dinner that was supposed to celebrate me, and I told her that. My mother was very apologetic and started to prepare falafels and burgers to everyone, putting the meat aside. She said that they hadn\u2019t thought much of it since I usually don\u2019t complain when they eat meat and I got freezer stuff. I thought the explanation was a bit weird but I appreciated her trying to fix things and calmed down.\n\nThen my dad got into the kitchen and my mom explained to him what had happened. He got defensive about it and wasn\u2019t apologetic at all. We had a bit of an argument and I started to cry. My sisters saw this and both chimed in, saying that they also thought it was weird. My dad just got quiet and gave up. The rest of the evening was nice but I could tell my dad was in a bad mood.\n\nThe next day my dad calls me up and wants to talk about the dinner. He said that what happened was my fault, I can\u2019t expect people to read my mind and that he was just focused on trying to get food on the table and didn\u2019t think about my veganism. This just made me more sad because I didn\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong, but I\u2019m starting to think that he may be right and can\u2019t expect non-vegans to understand that something like this would make me upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed formatting", "created_utc": 1690722151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dl3jg/aita_for_assuming_my_parents_would_cook_vegan/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since I became a vegan I've hosted my own birthday dinners just to not be difficult and make my parents go out of their way to cook vegan food.

You can also make some really delicious curries really easily, theres a blog I love called This Muslim Girl Bakes and her toor daal (yellow lentil daal) recipe is to die for I make it a lot it's such a good comfort meal.", "Gordon Ramsay does a lighter version of Beef Wellington:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyskqnp1j64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyskqnp1j64)", "The original (pre 1980) Joy of Cooking has a great recipe.", "Lentils can also be used to replace the ground pork or beef in Mapo Tofu. We have that fairly often at our house too.\n\nETA - Also, pasta e fagioli, which is an Italian classic made with beans and pasta, is another vegan standout. That's another regular in our menu rotation - and we're not even vegetarian (although we have at least 3, sometimes 4,  vegetarian dinners a week - healthful, economical, good for the planet).", "Yeah so if someone has allergies you make food they can eat my god everyone is such babies about accommodating peoples food needs. Feeding a vegan meat would make them sick if they've been vegan as long as OP has and like yeah if you're planning a meal for someone specific you would at least ask them what they'd like who taught y'all to host. You can make vegan food that doesn't trigger those allergies. It requires some imagination and forethought but can be done depending on the specific allergies.", "NTA\n\nThe problem isn't the veganism- the problem is they were hosting a dinner in honor of you without considering your preferences. Why on earth would you have the main meal be a something the guest of honor won't eat? The main meal should have been something you would eat, with maybe a meat dish as an extra option for guests. \n\nYour parents were incredibly thoughtless here and that's a problem. Having a quick frozen option at a family dinner is not the same as when the meal is supposed to be celebrating you. This honestly has zero to do with veganism at this point because it would be the same as serving a person's most hated food as the main course if the dinner was in their honor. You just don't do that- it's incredibly rude", "NTA but your parents point was fair. If you're usually outwardly content with them making whatever and just having vegan things on hand, they could have assumed that this time was no different. Yes, they could've (should've) asked what you would like for your dinner - but when they offered to host you could've said \"oh thank you, can we please serve x?\". Communication is important, especially about things that feel awkward to discuss. As you've learned, not communicating to avoid awkwardness only works for a limited time, and the awkwardness that ensues when the conversation inevitably happens is much worse.", "NTA: But at least they made sure there was something you could eat. My family had a pork roast with potatoes for mine - and cooked the potatoes in the pork fat so I couldn\u2019t even eat them. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA\nI was leaning towards NAH - parents probably should have asked about menu, but knowing there have been some issues in the past, it would have been good to raise the idea when they didn't. But your dad was a total AH with how he responded", "NTA\n\nI don't feel the whole meal needed to be vegan but I do feel there should have been at least several dishes (or half the menu) to accommodate your veganism. The lack of preparation (beyond freezer meals) show a lack of consideration on your parents part. The meal/gathering was to celebrate your accomplishment.", "NTA.  I\u2019m gluten free and in the past was also avoiding dairy and soy. My grandparents threw me a graduation party with a cook out and snacks and cake. I got to eat a piece of grilled chicken and some chips. That was it. They even made me take a picture with the cake I couldn\u2019t eat. It\u2019s unfair when people don\u2019t take your food restrictions seriously and only think about themselves.", "NAH. Sounds like assumptions and miscommunication.  You didn't clarify or say what you wanted,  and they assumed it would be like usual.", "It is selfish to decide that because it is your day everyone should eat vegan. People who are truly gluten intolerant don't expect no bread or pasta etc. at a meal for them, only of course expect your meal will be catered to your restrictions. This is the sort of thing that makes non-vegans say stuff about vegans like 'how do you know if someone is vegan? They will tell you all about it'. I've never met a vegetarian that has kicked off over meat being served - indeed they've grilled steaks happily for people. We had a work meal a while back and the person leaving ordered vegan food. All of it had mushrooms in it that I hate. I wouldn't insist that no one had mushrooms.  I would respect your choice of being vegan by ensuring you had a suitable meal. I do not respect imposing a dietary decision on others.", "NTA, Ave congratulations on graduating! I hope you get to eat some nice vegan food soon to celebrate", "YTA. While a shitty frozen meal isn\u2019t ideal, at least they\u2019re catering to you. What you\u2019re doing is forcing your personal values on others.\n\nYou want to be vegan, good for you. You shouldn\u2019t be forced or convinced not to. I would never do that. But when your veganism effects others that\u2019s when things change. Getting upset at the dietary choices of others is ridiculous and a you problem. \n\nI eat and enjoy meals that could be considered vegetarian and even vegan quite often (with the exception of fake meat. Fuck that), but I\u2019m not going to be compelled to eat that based on somebody else\u2019s lifestyle.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Parents made a mistake, fine. But your family\u2019s reaction makes them assholes. Nta", "It\u2019s not a mistake, they did it on purpose", "Agreed. I\u2019ve been vegan for 8 years, and until the more recent ones my family would send me milk chocolates for Valentine\u2019s Day, knowing full well I\u2019m vegan and dairy might lead to some VERY unpleasant time on the toilet. Oh, but \u201cit\u2019s just not common to find stuff like that\u201d \u2014 ok so send me a stuffed animal? I do absolutely appreciate the thought, I really do, but stuffed animals are a pretty normal for Valentine\u2019s Day and they know I LOVE stuffed animals, always have and forever will, like I still have a bear my dad bought me 20 years ago. So I just give the milk chocolates to me non-vegan friends. When I went to college I was allowed to have friends. I came back from class one day and my 2 friends had bought vegan red velvet cupcakes as a surprise from a pricey place (Sprinkles). \u201cIt\u2019s international vegan day!\u201d one of them announced. I hadn\u2019t even known. Usually we\u2019d all get different cupcakes and I\u2019d get the only vegan option, but that day we all had the vegan one. I genuinely felt loved that day. Wouldn\u2019t be angry if someone was throwing me a party and ate non vegan food I guess because I don\u2019t really expect it, but it IS a sign of respect.", "My husband can\u2019t eat lentils or mushrooms and our best friends are vegan\u2026 it\u2019s some real recipe gymnastics to make that combo of requirements work I can tell you!", "If your husband can eat pasta and beans look up recipes for pasta e fagioli. It's fantastic.", "NTA I think there are two issues here: the first about your parents cooking meat, and the second about how you brought it up. I think it's totally valid to have felt snubbed that the meal they were cooking was a normal meal they had normally cooked for the family and that you got frozen ready made falafels for your special day. And I think the way you brought it up was very mature and sensible. You didn't ask your mum to change anything, but explained how much it hurt you. And she realised she had made assumptions about how okay you were with things. Your dad's choice to say OP can't \"expect people to read my mind\" is ludicrous because when OP realised they'd not been more clear about their expectations, they... Told the family explicitly. And I think that it's not the first but the second issue the dad has gripes with. He's just sulking. \n\nNTA but OP might actually want to be a bit more vocal about their vegan preferences. Looks like she's TOO easygoing about it and could probably suggest other foods or bring her own foods to the table to diversity the platter. Sounds like the food she gets is boring and repetitive af and that the family assumes this is okay. And it sounds like the fam (sans the dad) might be receptive to this.", "NTA. You have a right to expect that a meal made to celebrate you will include food you can eat, rather than being focused on others with you as an afterthought.", "NTA but you should've discussed the menu with your parents in the planning stage. They're TA for planning on celebrating you with frozen food but cooking homemade for everyone else", "YTA for imposing your eating habits on them for dinner. I'd be cooking the meat i was expecting and not touch the vegan stuff", "ESH.  Your parents offered to make a graduation dinner. But you also stated that in the past when they had friends and family over they would cook vegan for you and the rest was non-vegan. \n\nSo the day of your party your parents are making food like that normally do with something for you and something for the rest.  It is obvious that you expected them to do all vegan food because the party in in honor of you.  I did not see any y where that you had a discussion about that.  \n\nI think this was a miscommunication and all of you are at fault. Next time have a chat about what you want and expect. Then no one is confused.", "NTA they know you\u2019re vegan. Have cooked vegan meals before. Your father wanted the party to be for him not you. Ignore him.", "She's been providing her own vegan options for 6 years. This may well have led her parents to not ask.", "I literally just followed her on Instagram. \nThank you so much for sharing this. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
