I'm 17 now and my brother is 15. The surrogate he used was a childhood friend of his. He wanted kids and wasn't in a relationship. She loved him (as a friend) and didn't want kids of her own but offered it to him. And yes, I do know without any doubt that it was legit surrogacy used and it was not them hooking up. I have photographic proof and a book dad kept for both me and my brother on the journey of having us.\n\nAnyway, when I was 12 he met his wife Sian. She was cool and we all got along fine. But once they got married 3 years ago things started to get a little awkward and weird. She seemed to expect that we'd look at her as a mom, didn't like that we only claimed one parent (we claimed her as family just not our parent). Her parents were also weirded out by the fact we were good with saying we had no mom, that we were born via surrogacy and that we had a good childhood. A few times we'd be asked if it wasn't nice to have a mom now (by her parents) or she would ask if we wanted her to adopt us and make our relationship official. Dad took my brother and I aside last year and told us that she just needs to feel like she's as important to the family as each of us is. That she feels awkward. So if she tries too hard or it feels like she's begging for confirmation, just know she's feeling insecure and just wants to feel loved and wanted by us.\n\nThree weeks ago our grandparents and Sian's parents were over and the whole thing came up yet again. Sian's parents brought up the whole mother thing again in a discussion with my grandparents about our surrogate (that Sian's parents brought up).  My grandparents said she wasn't our mother, she was our surrogate. They also said she did such a wonderful thing for us. I agreed and said she was never our mom but we would always be glad she was willing to let dad become a dad. This made Sian and her parents emotional and they were talking about how we missed out and how Sian could fill that. Dad said we didn't need to go over it again. Sian's parents said my brother and I needed more. I said we weren't lacking anything and they needed to relax. They got really loud and I told them to calm the fuck down, which started an eruption from Sian and her parents.\n\n3 weeks later Sian and her parents still feel like I owe them an apology and that I should have been glad they were worried about me.

It sounds like Sian/her parents really think having a mother is important. They're completely disregarding and ignoring the fact that you, your brother, and father have all been happy with this lifestyle/upbringing. And honestly at your age - it is really really hard to try and bond with a \"motherly\" figure. They need to refrain from this talk with you and your brother as it clearly is upsetting/pushing something you're not comfortable with!", "NTA. Wow, Sian and her parents are the assholes here. She came into your life when you, your brother and your dad were very happy and comfortable with your family and the way things are. And here she came with this old fashioned view that you all need a mommy (at 17 and 15!) and her parents agreed and pushed for it! How ridiculous!! I\u2019m glad your dad is on your side and stopping this madness.", "NTA\n\nSian is your step-mother, not your mother. She didn't raise you from birth, so you won't look to her as your mother in the first place. As long as you respect her, you should be fine.\n\nAs for her parents, this isn't their business, and yet they are interjecting themselves into this.", "NTA - You need to have a talk with your dad about how your feelings are not going to change and she is making you uncomfortable. Then HE needs to be clear with his wife that any continued pressure from her or her parents about you letting her be your \"mom\" is not acceptable and if she cannot accept her relationship with his children as it is, then it is going to impact the relationship she has with him. You and your brother are the kids here. It is not your job to meet her emotional needs in the way that she is expecting. \n\nYes, your outburst was rude. But they were adults ganging up on children and you have a right to defend yourself against that. It is not your responsibility to take the high road or be the bigger person. She is the adult.", "NTA\n\nShe and her parents are doing some weird guilt shit, y'all are fine and they need to back off. Tbh, she sounds desperate to be a mom\n\nImo, you have two options the next time they bring it up\n\n1. recommend therapy\n2. ask if she wants a pet so she can finally \"be a mother\" to something that wants/needs it", "Huge NTA. I've never understood this mentality that some step's have. Like, just because someone is married to your dad, that doesn't make them your parent. In trying to push you to assign the parent label to her, she's just pushing y'all away.", "NTA.  Sounds like Sian and her parents are trying to live out their imaginary life of having kids/grandkids by forcing y\u2019all into that role. It\u2019s not their place and they should back off. \n\nGood on your Dad for backing you. You owe them nothing, not even an apology. If they keeping bothering you, I hope you keep your dad informed. He seems like he won\u2019t stand for this crap and may help with enforcing boundaries. \n\nBest of luck OP, and once again. NTA\n\nETA: also NTA for telling them off. They were told multiple times to drop the subject, in the past and during this conversation, yet they persisted.", "NTA - Sian\u2019s parents are interjecting themselves somewhere they don\u2019t belong. They may have good intentions, but if they kept overstepping it was right to put your foot down. Now the language you used might be regrettable, but the fact remains they caused the issue", "You were NTA for saying what you did. Maybe a little harsh in the delivery, but it also sounds like being calm wasn\u2019t getting through to them. \n\nThey seem to have some old fashioned ideas on parenting, family, and conception. And maybe a bit of a saviour complex? \n\nYou could apologize for how you said it, but I wouldn\u2019t apologize for what you said. They need to accept that Sian didn\u2019t magically rescue you and you sibling from a loveless and empty childhood.", "Step parents these days are a trip. It\u2019s like they completely overlook the sentiments of their step kids and just push to be acknowledged by them as actual parents when they\u2019re not. One of these days they\u2019ll recognize their place\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Maybe you were a little salty in your choice of words, but it sounds like they backed you into a corner and wouldn't allow you to escape.  Why are Sian's feelings more important than yours and your brothers?  You do not want a new parent and are happy being the way you are.  Just because she wants it doesn't mean it should be foisted onto you.  If they divorce, she still holds the title.  Your feelings matter and they need to be told by your parent to drop it.  If YOU decide that is what you want it is different.", "NTA.\n\nYou could apologize for using \"crude language\" I suppose, but otherwise they need to apologize to you for trying to tell you how to feel.  And for disrespecting your Dad and how well he raised you.", "NTA\nThey keep overstepping your boundaries. They should also g free aware that they are obviously pushing you in the \"wrong\" direction.", "NTA. I understand everyone's feelings here: You don't feel like Sian is your mother, which is perfectly fair. Sian wants to be your mother or, at least, take that role in your life, and that's fair, too. Sian's parents want to support Sian, which is also fair.\n\nThe issue I see here is that you've told them how you feel, and they continue to harangue you about it, as if nagging will change the way you feel about *who your mother is or isn't.* I think they *should* shut the hell up about it and, when they don't, it's perfectly reasonable to tell them to.", "NTA. They don't understand how you could possibly *not* want a mom, and that's okay, I think it's a strange concept for people that had both a mom and a dad to grasp. But they need to respect your decision about this and understand that if they don't, there are going to be consequences. (The consequences are you getting angry and telling them to drop it.)", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re trying to convince you your childhood, your family, your whole life was crap until Sian arrived. They believe they\u2019re rescuing you and you point out you are not drowning.\n\nThere is an asshole here in that your father hasn\u2019t shut this shit down. He was so committed to being a father that he did it on his own. But then he lets others act as if it was a wrong that needed to be righted. He needs to step up. You should not have to defend your family, your history, or his choices.", "Half of AITA posts are about step parents with huge voids in their souls they were hoping the step kids would fill, and going about it the worst possible way. Yikesssss. \n\n\nNTA, OP - glad you are so strong and know yourself well enough to be able to shut down these pathetic excuses for adults.", "NTA. They\u2019re not going to stop pushing this, and they don\u2019t respect your feelings on the matter.", "NTA.  Sian and her parents are more attached to the idea in their heads about what \"should\" happen with children than to the reality of your family's life.  It's absurd for them to come in at this point, when you are happy and healthy (and likely well adjusted, based on this post) and declare that you need more. I'm glad your dad did say something, but he needs to take a firmer stance on this.  You have expressed your feelings and dad needs to now take charge and enforce those boundaries you have laid out with his wife.", "Sian and her parents are struggling with the brave new reality of our world that \"family\" comes in all shapes and sizes, and traditional family units aren't the only bus on the road.  They need to adjust to what is true for you, not vice versa.  NTA", "EDIT - NTA based on response.\n\nINFO: Have you directly told her that you're not interested in seeing her as a mom, or having a mom at all?", "Nta your new inlaws don't get to tell you that your whole life was lacking and that there's some mystical missing enrichment just because you weren't a traditional nuclear family. Every time motherhood is brought up it's going to sour your relationship more. Ask Sian why being herself isn't important enough without some imaginary job title and role that you never intend to employ her in. Sian is lovely in her own role as your fathers wife, and that doesn't make her any way diminished than being your mystical mother figure which you wouldn't be able to interpret to begin with.", "NTA. They\u2019re the ones who owe you an apology.", "NTA - First off, what is it with all these stepparents coming into the picture and think themselves entitled to be viewed as an actual parent by the kids. You can't force feelings or relationships upon other people.\n\nSecond, your dad needs to put his foot down. A mother isn't a necessity for a great childhood, the fact that your dad decided to have children by himself and you have had a great upbringing shows that. They are pretty much questioning the choices he made and your upbringing by idealising the nuclear family and saying that his wife enriched your life by joining.", "NTA. Sian's parents don't know boundaries, and you enforced yours. It sounds like you have a great dad & wanted for nothing. Even if the circumstances were different, and you had a mother who died or skipped town, Sian came along too late for you to bond with her in a motherly role. Her insecurities are not your burden to bear.", "NTA\n\nWhat Im hearing is that you explained numerous times that you were happy with your life the way it has been and that you missed out on nothing by not having a declared 'mom'. You have accepted Sian as part of your family, just not as 'mom' and yet she and her parents kept pushing and pushing and pushing until you finally blew up.\n\nNo apology needed by YOU.", "NTA\n\nYou need to sit down with your dad, Sian, and her parents. Tell them they are to listen, and not talk.\n\nThen you and your brother need to tell them while you see them as family, and care for them. That you will never see Sian as a mom. And if they continue to try and force this on you, that is only going to cause more problems and push you both away from her and them. To the point you might eventually go NC when you move out.\n\nYou need to talk to your dad alone before hand and let him know what you plan to do. And tell him that he needs to stand behind your brother, and your decision on this. And put his foot down with his wife that HE CHOSE and tell her and her family they need to stop trying to force something on the both of you that you do not want.\n\nOtherwise this will continue to be a problem and you will eventually resent all of them. \n\nForcing people to do something they don't want never ends good.", "NTA, her and her parents are weird. Your dad would be wise to end this relationship, she\u2019s gonna ruin yalls family and drive a big wedge through it", "NTA.  You are allowed to not call your stepmom your mom.  Be mindful of the financial ramifications.  Your dad is now married and they are both in charge of their finances.  If you don't call her mom, she has no responsibility for paying for college or supporting you at all in the future.  As long as you are ok with dealing with this, then you are absolutely in the right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
