You probably would be neglectful too, keep up a long lasting birth control like the injection.", "NTA there's no reason to coddle your abuser. if the family way is 'make your own way' then tell your sister that or ask her if she needs help moving mom into her place?", "NTA. And *hugs*. I have been in this situation.\n\nMy mother got divorced, and her first thought was to turn to me and say 'that's okay, I'll just move in with you'. That didn't fly, as I was not about to take in my abusive mother, though we were still on speaking terms at the time. She did not like that, and despite being set up in a very nice nursing home, decided she'd try to force me into taking her in by threatening to leave it and live on the streets.\n\nI didn't take her bait, and she did leave and did end up living on the streets (she was tossed many a lifeline by various members of my family, all of which she refused, because nothing would do except she move in with ME and have my wife and I take care of her). I went NC around this time due to other things she pulled right before leaving the nursing home.\n\nShe was on the street and in and out of various shelters, still abusing everyone around her. Then I got a call from my older sister that she was in a state institution and was dying. This was two years after I went NC, and I had told my older sister at that time (when I went NC) that I would no longer be taking care of Mom, and wanted nothing to do with her end of life care when it came to that nor her funeral, nor would I be visiting her during the former or attending the latter. \n\nDuring her last week my other two sisters were with her, and I got a lot of passive aggressive messages from my older sister about how hard it was to be handling everything herself and how expensive and how she had school work and all this other stuff and it would just be SO NICE if she had more help with that and the finances. I heard also through the other sister that she felt that me and the other siblings who were NC should just put 'our feelings' aside because Mom 'needed us'. \n\n>Why is she putting me in this position.\n\nBecause she doesn't want to deal with it. She wants YOU to deal with it. She wants you to absolve her of her guilt-driven obligation. In my sister's case, that was exactly the reason. I had always taken care of Mom so she didn't have to, and now I was refusing to do so and it was *so hard* for her. But here's the thing-both your sister and mine made the decision to do this. I didn't make my sister take up Mom's care or responsibility for her- she chose to be there and do it. And that's fine, but your sister's choice in what she does for your mom or what relationship she wants with your mom does not obligate YOU.\n\nYour mother getting sad and lonely is not your responsibility. Your mother is a grown adult, and if she wanted you to be there for her she wouldn't have abused you. If your sister wants to try and be there for her that's fine, but it *can* just be her. If it just being her is too hard, that's for your sister to decide how much she wants to pull back or not. YOU are not obligated for your sister's or your mother's decisions that put them in this situation.\n\nThe next time you talk to your sister, and she asks those questions, simply tell her no. \"No, I can't try and call or visit her. You know the history, and you know why. This is not up for debate or negotiation. If you choose to keep her company and help her that's fine, but it is your choice. I'd appreciate you not bringing this up again, you have my answer and it isn't going to change.\"\n\nAnd if she does, excuse yourself from the call and refuse to discuss it further. Hang up if you need. Go LC or NC with her for a time as well if you need. \n\nYou don't owe your abuser anything. She is facing the consequences for her neglect and poor life choices. You can't neglect other people when they are helpless and in need if you want them around when YOU are helpless and in need. If she didn't want those consequences she should have behaved better.", "How do you think you're mother killed your brother? That is just so...

It took me years of hard work to trust others and even more years of hard work to trust my own experiences. I hope that you won't have to work as hard but please know that there are good people out there, and it is very rewarding to get to have joy with people you trust. I wish you sooo much self love and good luck.\nAnd of course, nta.\nI don't think your siblings are assholes exactly either, cuz it's really hard to hear and believe your parents are abusive cuz we're always taught we're overreacting or we need to be tougher. It's almost impossible, but it's still not an excuse. Either-way, you may have to come up with how you want to phrase your boundary with your sibling/s, so that you can stay firm and clear and maybe one day they will see your boundary as a good example...I know I did when my sister told me last year that she just couldn't handle a family gathering with everyone. And then told me what she could handle. I was so sad at first but it eventually led to my break through.", "I had a pretty similar upbringing with my parents. They both physically and emotionally abused me for 19 years. I remember once when I was 8 my mom got upset with me for forgetting a piece of paper at school so she pushed me down a flight of stairs and then kicked me when I got to the bottom. Saying that I shouldn't be such a \"forgetful little shit\" My father to his credit watched this whole thing and laughed. So I can relate to what you're saying. I hate my parents and I never want to see them. My siblings like yours refuse to acknowledge or admit that our upbringing was abusive. I eventually stopped talking to them as well honestly. My advice? Cut them off. You don't need people in your life that make you depressed, anxious, or stressed out. That's not how family is supposed to work. Good luck, big hug from me and NTA!", "Please don't waste another moment worrying about your mother or your sisters.

That age gap is huge.\n\nYou mother was a great deal younger, and given that your father was still around, they probably had a much more stable childhood than you.  They probably didn't worry about their nest meal, and both your parents may have been concerned about their education.\n\nYou were 1 yr old when your oldest sister left, and 4 yrs old when the next sister left.  You don't say how old your were when your father left.\n\nYour childhood sounds horrific.  Your sisters didn't witness it.  It does not diminish your truth.  \n\nYou have every right to be angry with your mom. You have no reason to contact her.\n\nIt sounds like you have every reason to be NC with everyone in your family.  \n\nWould your sisters be willing to see a family therapist with you so that you can all understand that you had different experiences, different childhood, and therefore different feeling about your mother?\n\nNTA", "NTA- I haven\u2019t seen a suggestion for r/raisedbynarcissists but you might wanna check them out. \n\nYou sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and clear boundaries.

Of course your Sister's had a vastly different experience than you.  They were essentially in an entirely different family.  You Mom got MUCH worse after they left.  Same thing happened to my Wife.

I know you don't agree with that, but I don't care. If you want to go around to people whose mothers starved them, abandoned them, and left them to provide for themselves and tell them they weren't really abused, you're welcome to be that callous. But, you're not going to do it with many any longer. I do not ever want to see her again. I do not want to talk to her again. I do not want to hear about her. She will never be part of my life, so you both need to accept this. By continuing to pretend that my abuser is anything more than that, you're just hurting my relationship with you. I'm drawing a firm boundary that I want nothing to do with this person. If you can't respect that, I'll be going low contact with you.\"\n\nThen, do it.

Your mother was neglectful **at best**, and so much worse most of the time it sounds. As for your sisters, it's their perogative if they wanna revise their lifestories, but you don't have to listen to their narrative.

My mother is a narcissist and has some sort of undiagnosed mental health issues (that she refuses to get help for.) She also is an addict. She's mentally abusive and a massive injustice collector. She can't hold down a job, owes me and my Aunt thousands of dollars. I've pretty much cut off most of my contact with her because I refuse to bail her out or let her treat me like absolute shit. I'm done. She's on her own. I don't owe her shit. \n\nYou gotta do what you gotta do for your own happiness and mental health. You're not an asshole.", "NTA: abusers should be left to rot.", "NTA, NOT AT ALL.\n\nIt is possible to forgive and not forget\u2014the core truth of this oft-used (and misused) phrase is that you can both learn and act accordingly from something you have forgiven someone for. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t at all intend to imply you\u2019ve forgiven your mother, I\u2019m more pointing at the idea of learning from experience and in the future acting according to what you\u2019ve learned. In this case, you faced a childhood consisting of abuse, endangerment and UTTER neglect. Your mother is neither a safe person to have a relationship with, nor a person you would want to communicate or have any contact with. \n\nLooking out for yourself and sparing yourself additional trauma does NOT make you an asshole, it indicates that you are a well-adjusted person. \n\nYour siblings clearly have not realistically dealt with their own childhood neglect and abuse and would rather ignore it\u2014along with invalidating and ignoring your own. That is not cool. I would recommend drawing a firm boundary with them, something clearly (and curtly, if needs be) put, such as \u201cI do not intend to have ANY contact with our mother, now or in the future, and it\u2019s not a topic I will have any further discussion about. I\u2019m glad to talk with you about anything else besides our mother or ANY matters pertaining to her.\"\n\nGoing no-contact with your siblings is also an option, but I would consider trying this first. They clearly both have trauma that they themselves can\u2019t even acknowledge, much less work on, and they\u2019re reacting to the idea of the mortality of the person who gave birth to them. They\u2019re behaving very badly with regard to you, but if this isn\u2019t a long-term pattern with them it is quite possibly their own trauma being unconsciously stirred up and channeled into doing for her what she never did for them. People react strangely around trauma, dying and death. So it may be worth drawing a clear, firm boundary before going strict no-contact. It\u2019s your call, and just my own advice.\n\nI wish you all the best and want to affirm your decision to stand strong against having any contact with that woman, and drawing boundaries with your siblings. You\u2019re not the asshole, you seem to be the most reasonable and well-adjusted person in your immediate family.", "NTA Sorry, but your mom deserves nothing from you. My response would be along the lines of \" She's not as helpless as a 10 year old left alone with out food or money. She'll manage. I did.\"", "I hope u/baebritt sees your response!", "Part of it is \"gut\" feeling based on how she treated me.  Bluntly, I was lucky to live long enough to enter school.  Part of it is \"gut\" feeling based on how the whole family treated the matter of his death.  It was a forbidden topic, just like he never existed.  The only pictures I could find of him (died right before I was born) were as a toddler, always in a cast.  Note the cast kept changing from one limb to another.  And I knew exactly why he was wearing the cast.  (without asking)  Also found out through distant relatives that the whole family suffered from both physical and sexual abuse perpetrated on the daughters by their fathers and uncles.  Consequently, she hated men.  And boys.  Anybody with a penis was evil, and must be destroyed.  So it's kind of ironic that she ever got pregnant.  But I'm sure my bio dad suffered almost as much as I did.  Shortly before she got pregnant with me, she was involuntarily committed for a year to a mental institution.  Never got the official diagnosis, but it was something to do with impulse control / violent behavior.  My dad's divorce, in a cause state, granted by the judge who remarked in hand-written note that the cause was \"extreme cruelty\".  Cause of death accidental, multiple skull fractures.  On that bit.  If you go to the house I grew up  in, you will (to this day) find a huge dent/crack in the wall of the living room.  That was my 5-year-old HEAD that caused the damage.  Never knew my brother, but he was 5 when he mysteriously had an \"accident\" that damaged his skull, which ended his life.
