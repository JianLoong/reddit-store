Under the circumstances, you might need to ghost your entire family.  I had to ghost the entire bio mom's family.  Long story short, I also was abused and neglected as a young child, and I suspect that my bio mom killed my older brother.  (Can't prove it, but all  the pieces fit nicely into place....would explain a LOT)  But when I had enough abuse and told my bio mom that she was never to try to contact me in any manner, all her relatives rallied around her like I was the bad guy.  Alrighty then...I don't need contact with ANY of them.  That was about 40 years ago.  Best decision I ever made.", "NTA , your sister can feel morally obligated on her own.

Don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into seeing her. She chose to treat you like  trash and choose drugs, alcohol, and worthless men over her own kids. I also think it\u2019s horrible your own family let you sleep in your car when you lost your job and you were homeless. Your sisters are in denial about how your home life was growing up, no your mom didn\u2019t do the best she could. Doing the best she could would\u2019ve been making sure you had a roof over your head and clothes, food, and making sure you felt safe, protected,  and loved.

If they want to take care of your mom, then let them but you owe them (and your mom) nothing and they have no right to judge you now.
