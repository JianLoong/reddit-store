I have dreadlocks, don\u2019t shave any part of my body( pits included), and don\u2019t typically wear makeup. \n\nI was asked to get the dress altered for my height so it wouldn\u2019t drag and be tripping me. And that was literally the only ask she had. No comment on my hair or hairy body. Because she wasn\u2019t asking some paid model to show up for her wedding. She was asking me, a whole human, to be there. \n\nBrides are in sane.", "She may feels she has to have her as she is her sister.", "I agree, NAH. It is an event the sister is presumably spending a lot of money on. I can understand simple requests that fit the aesthetic. If it\u2019s going to cause drama with the conservative in laws, I also get not wanting to have to deal with that on her wedding day. OP isn\u2019t wrong to want to wear the same dress, but should be prepared to step down because of it. It also seems like both are not willing to compromise - there\u2019s makeup that can cover tattoos that is long lasting and will be a lot less burden than a long sleeved dress in the summer. But OP doesn\u2019t have to do that if she feels it\u2019s a principle thing. But again, OP\u2019s sister isn\u2019t being unreasonable imo", "Yes, maybe a compromise could be covering up the tattoos with make-up instead of wearing long sleeves.", "I agree. Maybe OP could wear the same dress, but with a sheer shawl thingy. The tats will still be visible, but not so prominent. Who knows, other bridal party members may want the sheer thing as well. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Did a bridesmaid with tattoos steal your thunder on your special day??", "Those sound like beautiful pieces, definitely hold your ground!", "Excellent point.", "Mine too but flowers are the least offensive tattoos I can think of", "If the in-laws are so conservative, why are any of the bridesmaids wearing sleeveless dresses? Had OP's sister made all of the bridesmaids wear long sleeves, this drama could've been avoided.", "This is similar to the phrase, miraculous birth. Do you know how many births there have been in the history if the world? Billion's. A Miricale by definition is rare.", "What a cruel thing to say", "They still look awful", "I\u2019ve always thought of it as sitting in a dogs mouth. Because on top of the nasty wet, you have the hot. And if you\u2019re in Alabama, the stink.", "I think a lot of conservative people see sleeveless as different from tattoos though. I definitely know older people who would care about tattoos over (tasteful and cleavage covering) sleeveless dresses. If it\u2019s going to be a huge deal, I don\u2019t know why the sister asked in the first place, but it sounds like the sister doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with the in-laws caring and didn\u2019t realize it would be an issue until after. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge sacrifice to wear makeup or a light shawl as other commenters have suggested for someone you love. But also, if OP doesn\u2019t want to do that, that\u2019s her choice.", "Though to be fair, not sure I\u2019ve ever heard a groom refer to their wedding as their \u2018special day\u2019.", "It just seems odd to make one person wear something \"modest\" to appease in laws as opposed to having all of the bridesmaids appear \"modest\", ***especially*** if you're using aesthetic as a BS excuse. Want to know something that will throw off an aesthetic? Having one bridesmaid wear a long sleeve dress when all of the other bridesmaids are sleeveless. Feels OP's sister is just making excuses because she doesn't like OP's tattoos."]}
