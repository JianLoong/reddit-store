{"id": 22209, "submission_id": "14z7uow", "title": "AITA for throwing away my pads in the bathroom trash can ?", "selftext": "I, 19F, am currently home from college for the summer. When I was at college, I lived in a suite, so all of us shared a bathroom. Originally there were 8 of us, but 4 moved to other rooms or halls (one dropped out), so it ended up just being four of us. Me, my roommate, the girl across the hall from us, and her roommate. We all shared a bathroom. \n\nIn my suite, we all had synced up our periods at one point, which happens when girls live together. Most of the other girls used tampons, but I use pads because tampons frankly scare me. We had a dedicated trash can for our feminine hygiene products, and when we were done with them, we would just throw them away. I would roll up my pads and then throw them in the trash can, and no one seemed to mind since we took turns taking the trash to the trash room each week. \n\nNow, since I\u2019ve been home, I\u2019ve gotten my period twice. I\u2019ve changed nothing about my routine, and have continued to throw away my pads. My mom talked to me a few days ago, and asked me if I could dispose of them in a more sanitary way, which I understood. She said that my dad doesn\u2019t like seeing feminine hygiene products when he opens the trash can. So I started wrapping then in tissue before throwing them away, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for my dad. \n\nThis time, my dad came up to me and asked if I could flush them down the toilet because they \u201cgross him out.\u201d I told him that I can\u2019t do that, since you\u2019re not supposed to flush those kinds of things, but he said he doesn\u2019t care, and doesn\u2019t want to see it. He also said he didn\u2019t want to see the wrappers that the pads came in, because they also gross him out. My mom told me that she got into the habit of throwing her pads away at the bottom of the trash can and cover them with more tissue so they\u2019re basically invisible. This, to me, sounds like overkill, but maybe I\u2019ve been living with girls for too long and that has warped my thoughts on how to handle these things. AITA?\n\nEdit; The trash can has a lid, so he\u2019s not going to see them unless he opens the trash can deliberately. My mom and dad are 48 and 50, respectively. My dad never takes out the trash, and I know this because I hear my mom complain about it all the time.", "created_utc": 1689313920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z7uow/aita_for_throwing_away_my_pads_in_the_bathroom/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
