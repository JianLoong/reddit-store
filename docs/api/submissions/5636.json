I hope you can get out soon.", "Nta how dare he be so selfish and ignorant. The gift was for your wife and if he wanted to play the \u201cwhat would you do if\u201d game he should\u2019ve brought a makeup gift himself. The fact that it was unwrapped by your mom aswell is just worse because it was for YOUR WIFE.
