She confronted you because she overheard your interaction and wanted to justify herself. You're just trying to follow the rules", "NTA. If it's staff parking then it's staff parking. I'd suggest to the manager to implement staff parking badges and ticket all cars without a valid badge.", "NTA\n\nI teach at a school with assigned parking spots, barely enough for staff\n\nBig ass signs \u2018Staff Only\u2019 and \u2018Choose Respect\u2019\n\nThe amount of times I go to park and get a dismissive wave from a parent in my spot\u2026. Who then complains I wasn\u2019t in my room on time for an impromptu meeting (as they, y\u2019know, parked in my spot) is pretty common\n\nUnfortunately we can\u2019t call them out as they can be volatile \n\nMy natural consequence loving ass would not sign into work unless I could park\n\nLifeguard can\u2019t park?\n\nNo one can swim, health and safety regulation\n\nCould stop it pretty quickly", "NTA. just a really thin skin.  Do you freak out anytime anyone doesn't treat you like royalty?  Come on, you did nothing wrong.  You stated a fact in response to a question, a customer overheard the factual statement and tried to say why she parked there and the customer did not like that answer.  You have a job to do and if they don't like the policy they can speak to someone able to change it instead of being mad at you.  You are certainly entitled to feel the way you do, but you did nothing wrong.  The other staffer was an AH and so is this lady IF she is treating you this way.", "NTA, it is marked for staff, it should only be for staff. Not only was the entitled person wrong for even wanting the spot, but the employee for setting a precedence that if the spot is empty go ahead and take it.", "NTA and this entitled lazy behavior is possibly the most annoying thing on earth. If she has a disability that prevents her from walking that distance comfortably, then there should be disability parking she should be able to get a permit for. Otherwise it's 300 whole ass meters and she needs to just cope. The pool operator had no business speaking for the rest of the staff and giving those spots away. If he wanted to give his away, that's his business, but I'm going to guess that he nabbed one of those spots for himself and then didn't care about the inconvenience his generosity caused everyone else working there.   \n\n\nUnless you were overly antagonistic and rude about it, those women are being extremely entitled and unkind. If you're comfortable, I'd have a conversation with the pool operator and explain the difficulties this has caused you. If he doesn't agree, request that he remove the 'staff only parking' signs and see how quickly his goodwill melts away when he suddenly also loses his convenient parking.", "NTA.  You meant saying that patrons should not park in reserved staff places.  Right?  Perhaps they have all been allowing it.  Or there is a big difference in your ages.  At the very least you are working with a bunch of assholes.", "Colleague really should have communicated this with the rest of the staff to prevent something like this to happen", "NTA", "She should get there earlier when the lot is not full\u2026", "Nta staff parking is for STAFF.

She owes you one.", "I did have a thought to ask if it was in a sketchy area, but honestly -- cold as it sounds -- my opinion still stands either way. I keep self-defense items on me at all times and if an area makes me uncomfortable to visit solo at 0600, I either choose a less sketchy place to frequent, find someone to go with, or just go at a time where there are more people. I don't appropriate parking not intended for me, and if I was given the nod and then discovered I was inconveniencing the staff, I would be mortified and would stop immediately. I'm going to guess that the situation embarrassed her and she reacted defensively by icing you out, but that still doesn't make her treatment of you valid.", "Go to management.  Or fuck 'em.
