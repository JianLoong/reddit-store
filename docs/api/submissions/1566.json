I would personally die on this hill. If you don't then she will constantly change the rules to suit her.", "NTA due to this set up. you are keeping it 100% fair. she didn't want to combine incomes when you were making considerably less but now you make considerably more and she wants to combine incomes now? smells fishy. \n\nthat being said most couples do combine most of their income as shared as it's just easier most of the time. you may have to die on this hill or find a happy medium like combining only some for spending together like bills, dates etc. and have personal accounts for personal spending and personal bills like the car.", "He also did answer it. Just took longer than you would have liked", "Yes.  He answered my original question.  I asked the 2nd question 2 minutes after his answer.", "Give the guy some time, goodness. You\u2019re completely wrong, btw.", "She was paying a larger percentage of the bills for many years (PhD and post doc could have been 8 years) while he was in school.  He made 300K last year, so he should have been paying 3x what she paid for the bills.  Several people have asked if the bill paying has been adjusted.  He has not answered.  So it doesn't seem that we have all the facts yet.", "Does it say anywhere he didn't?", "He did answer already", "He answered my early question and said that they paid the bills in proportion to their income.  I and several people have asked if that has been adjusted, he didn't answer.  So we don't have all the information yet to make a judgment, IMO.  I still haven't posted a judgment, but I will before the end.  I'm not willing to say N T A yet, especially if he withheld information.", "Sorry, I had real life stuff. I assumed by me saying proportional it meant I\u2019d be paying it proportional", "I would make an edit if I was you."]}
