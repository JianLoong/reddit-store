You harboring jealousy and resentment and not voicing it isn't kosher, doesn't bode well for your marriage at all.\n\nShe sucks because you're either in or out in a marriage.  It makes sense to protect yourself, it makes sense to have some trepidation of \"but I earned the money\", but it's easily contextualized in \"My wife is a SAHM but I earn the money, so I get to say what's done with it\".  Different of course because being a SAHM is unpaid labor that does have value, but all the same.  It certainly does matter exactly what the expenses were and what \"a bit fancier stuff than me\" means, but in general it isn't an acceptable frame of mind to say that your spouse deserves less because they earn less.  Protect yourself, be smart, but it shouldn't be that one spouse drives a Model S and the other is in a '99 Corolla.\n\nYou suck for similar reasons.  You're not giving us a clear timeline, nor numbers for what before expenses and after expenses were.  Regardless of that, you're married.  Assuming you're in the United States, it matters very little which of you earns the money now that you're married, same for your stake in the start up.\n\nIf your expenses before were 3k a month and she was paying 2k to your 1k, but now your expenses are 6k a month where you're paying 4.5k to her 1.5k, then she doesn't have a great leg to stand on.  She's \"saving\" $500 a month more than before, so jealously clearly is playing a part, just like it did for you before.  But if expenses before were a 1k/2k split, but now expenses are a 7.5k/2.5k split, it should be obvious where her issue is.  You earn a lot more and your combined quality of life has gone up, but she has less personal money.\n\nAll of that being said, what is there to be gained here?  If you two divorce, again assuming USA, then she gets half anyway.  Yes, you still have the higher paying position, but is it worth the resentment?  Punishing your wife for something she legitimately may not have known isn't doing yourself any favors.\n\nYou do need to protect yourself, same as she does, but an eye for an eye leaves the world blind.  You two are married, you should be able to have an adult discussion.  You make 300k, she makes 100k.  It won't kill you to effectively mean you earn 250k and she makes 150k if it will make a happy marriage.  There's obvious ridiculous stuff, like if she starts spending far beyond her means and expecting you to pick up the bill, but only you would know about your wife like that.  Protect yourself from things like that, but you two need a serious conversation about what it needs to be married.  Equal =/= Fair, and Fair =/= Right/Good enough.  What is most important is how you both feel about the situation, within reason.\n\nSame idea though, if you two have children and she becomes a SAHM, what then?  Is she going to be expected to pay 1/4th of the expenses while not working?  Are you going to determine what her labor is worth and split things accordingly?  Cmon now, you know what you're doing.\n\nHer solution is likely also not it, but you two should be able to find a compromise.  You're right, it doesn't make much sense to have an equal share of the income.  You make 300k, she makes 100k, before she made 100k and you made 32k.  It doesn't much make sense that now each of you effectively gets 200k, or 200k goes into the communal pot and 100k to each of you for fun money.  That just means you're effectively paying your wife 100k/year, while she wasn't paying you 30k/year previously.  But it's a discussion to have.  Choosing to not listen to your wife, say her feelings \"feel like bullshit\" and having the opinion that she wants to \"have her cake and eat it too\" does not bode well for either of you.", "Interesting how sexist Reddit is.

Yeah YTA. The key differences between the two of you, because you both literally have the same issue in different parts of your timeline, is that she tried to address this situation like an adult in a committed relationship and you didn't. As well as the fact that the two of you didn't live together when this initial arrangement was created. It makes sense to keep finances split when you're not sharing a roof. And it would have also made sense for you to say you want a more equitable split on everything relevant to the relationship at that point in the past. But you didn't take the clear and constantly present opportunity to approach this situation in a manner that actually benefits you and your relationship, you chose to stew. It really doesn't make sense to me now how you're insisting that the financial arrangement should stay the exact same now that the two of you are in a very different set of circumstances in your relationship.

At first I wanted to include your wife in this judgement, but I don't think I can even call her hypocritical here because you can't honestly say that she was aware of how you felt about this arrangement when you never communicated this to her. \n\nDo you want a happy and healthy relationship with this person? Or do you want to punish her for every perceived slight when the opportunity presents itself? That's the actual choice being made here by you. You can choose to work through this issue with clear and honest communication, or you can keep splurging on yourself to really stick it to her and show her what for!

Why is it different just because the man is now making more money?  I say NTA.  Equitable contribution to shared expenses based on income still seems fair.  Sometimes you\u2019re up and sometimes you\u2019re down.

OP, if you would prefer to keep the financial arrangement you guys have had this whole time in place, that\u2019s a valid position to have, but you have to be willing to voice it and your reasoning behind it. If a part of that is you had some resentment when you were earning less and now your wife wants to turn change things up now that you\u2019re the one making more, then that\u2019s a conversation you need to have.

Damn, that must be nice. Plus his 30k on top of that!\n\nI agree with the sentiment, and I would (mostly) feel the same way. I also agree that score-keeping is not a great idea in a marriage. However...if I feel like my partner hasn't cut me a fair shake and now wants to reap the rewards of my hard work, I can see feeling a certain type of way (stubborn lol) about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are too many stories of one partner being used...I just read one today. In a nutshell, OP, gf, and gf's daughter had been living together for 10 years, gf stopped working when she moved in with OP. Daughter's bio-dad flitted in and out of her life. He paid for nothing, stuck around long enough to break his promises and her heart and dip out, only to rinse and repeat months later. OP raised her as his own, paid her college tuition, bought her a car to get to college, let her live at home rent-free while going to school.\n\nDaughter got engaged. OP asked for 20 of his friends and family to be invited somewhere in the 250 guest limit, since it was his \"step-daughter's\" wedding and he was paying for it. They said, sure, np. He calls his friends and tells them to save the date. Few weeks before the wedding, OP asks a friend if he was planning on coming. Friend responds, \"I'm not invited. I got an announcement, but no invitation.\" OP was confused. Friend had the card in his car. Sure enough, it's an announcement, not an invite, and furthermore, it was listed as \"Ex-husband and GF would like to announce...\" OP was not mentioned.\n\nHe confronts gf, who hadn't bothered to, you know, be an adult and tell him to his face. She says she couldn't fit his friends in the 250 limit, \"but maybe if someone drops out.\" OP says too late, my friends have already been insulted.\n\nThey have a get-together before the wedding, at OP's house. Both sides of the family, and a surprise guest. Bio-dad. Daughter makes an announcement, \"I'm so glad to say my REAL dad will be able to come to my wedding...and he will be giving me away.\"\n\nOP is blindsided, hurt, angry. He collects himself for a minute then stands up to give a toast: \"I'm so appreciative to bride and groom, because they have taught me something invaluable today: that instead of being a respected member of this family, I have in fact been reduced to nothing but a glorified ATM. Since my role as host in this wedding has been passed on, I also pass on the payments for the wedding to my replacement, Real Dad. Y'all can see yourselves out.\" Icing on the cake was (now ex-) gf handed him the wedding planning book to try to guilt him about all the hard work he was \"ruining,\" and he discovered the father-daughter dance was to ex husband (so had been planned for a while), and the menu included items OP was allergic to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnywho, that long-winded recap was basically to say, this kind of thing happens all the time, and it starts small...sometimes with the wife wanting her cake and to eat it too. It's hard to know when it's a case of \"maybe I'm overreacting,\" or a case of \"no, if I don't nip this in the bud now, ten years down the road I'll discover she was using me all this time.\"", "Yeah so she supported his ass while he was just a boyfriend and he resents her for that??
