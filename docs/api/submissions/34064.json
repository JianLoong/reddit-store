Making your partner sleep on the couch is childish and ridiculous and controlling. \n\nYou need to start setting healthy boundaries.  A 23 year old having a temper tantrum and slamming doors is not acceptable.

I\u2019m disappointed to say the least because I feel as though my boyfriend is taking my family for granted and now that he thinks life is so sweet he thinks he can do and act however. I\u2019m not gonna deal with it for much longer so either he can act right or he can go. I\u2019m not letting him burn my bridges because he\u2019s \u201cselectively mature\u201d", "And a newborn.
