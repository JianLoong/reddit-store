My mom and her boyfriend were together for 12 years, so she\u2019s taking it the hardest which you would think we would be too. But that\u2019s not the case.\n\nI feel horrible for not grieving, but at the same time it still doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s processed to me. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think anything of it till my mom was shouting at me, \u201cThere is something WRONG with you two for not being upset. He was our family, he RAISED you!\u201d.\n\nNow here\u2019s my defense: My stepdad did live with us for most of my life, but he didn\u2019t raise me. He didn\u2019t even raise his own son. I mostly raised my brother due to bad circumstances growing up, which my stepdad caused. He often laid hands on my mom right in front of us, which i was old enough to know that\u2019s not okay, but that\u2019s not cool. You don\u2019t do that ever, let alone in front of your kids, no matter how old they are. On top of that he had gotten my mom and him into hard drugs for a few years.\n\nSo i guess you could say the strong feelings i had for him weren\u2019t the nicest. He\u2019s done nothing but destroy to our family for the past twelve years to the point where even my mom hated him. He\u2019s the first and only persons death i haven\u2019t grieved over (i\u2019ve cried, many times however), and now i\u2019m questioning if i\u2019m crazy like my mom says.", "created_utc": 1695806723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tfvgu/aita_for_not_grieving_over_my_moms_boyfriends/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Total and utter RELIEF. \n\nRelief that this drug-addled abuser is gone from my life, gone from influencing my mother towards drugs, and most especially, gone from abusing the most vulnerable members of the household\u2014you and your brother. \n\nYour mom chose this abuser, so her emotions should never be your guide\u2014should never be what you strive for. You and your feelings are not wrong, and I\u2019m so sorry that you are even in this position. \n\nYou, my dear, are 100% NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not crazy, and there's nothing wrong with you.\n\nIf your mom claims there's something wrong with you for not being upset, it might be a good idea to sit her down and explain exactly, in meticulous detail, to her why you're not upset.", "NTA.\n\nFirst everyone grieves differently and second you don't have to grieve a perosn you don't have nice feelings for\n\nI can see why your mother is upset. Those doesn't mean that you have to change your grieve or not grieving. But you can tell your mother something alonge the line, that you trie to be strong for her and your little brother, so they can grieve and it is your way to process the grieve. Might be a small lie but it sounds nicer than 'I didn't like him so I'm not grieving'. Also you said yourself you cried about his death (or did i missread?) so this is also grieving. Maybe if you want to add this, you can also tell your mother, that you are crying but you do it in private because it feels closer, right? what so ever", "No you're not the asshole. He didn't raise you, he ruined a good chunk of your life. I can't believe your mother is guilting you over this. Don't be too hard on yourself when your mother eventually passes and you're not overcome by grief.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You either care about someone or you don't.\n\n>There is something WRONG with you two for not being upset.\n\nNot at all.\n\n>He often laid hands on my mom right in front of us, which i was old enough to know that\u2019s not okay\n\n>he had gotten my mom and him into hard drugs for a few years\n\n>He\u2019s done nothing but destroy to our family for the past twelve years\n\nI'd be opening a bottle of champagne in front of her.", "NTA. Grief is a weird thing. You may grieve later, you may never at all, and anything in between. All of it is 100% acceptable, because grief is 100% personal. No one gets to tell you how to process a loss. Your mom is also processing, and probably not quite in her right mind at the moment. That doesn't make it ok for her to yell at you like that, but it might help you understand why she is being the way she is.", "NTA I hated my mum\u2019s boyfriend because he was emotionally abusive to my mother and went out of his way to insult people. He once called me \u201cbrave\u201d for wearing a swimming costume and I was not even plus size!!!\n\nWhen he died it was the weirdest feeling because I cried so much and it didn\u2019t help that I had the flu. I could not understand why I was crying so much over someone whom I disliked and tried to limit contact.\n\nI think it\u2019s great that you know your own mind. If you don\u2019t want to grieve for someone whom you hate, there is absolutely no rule that says you must. Your mum is grieving because she is still in \u201cthe fog\u201d of domestic violence.\n\nMy mother would not have left her boyfriend least of all because he threatened her. His death was the best thing ever. She has turned a formerly miserable existence into a thriving life. I hope that one day your mum will do the same.\n\nIt took about 10 years of casually discussing relationships etc with mum\u2026 after her boyfriend\u2019s death\u2026 for her to even realise that she was in a DV relationship\u2026. So don\u2019t be surprised if your mum can\u2019t talk about it.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with you not feeling grief after the death of someone who was abusive. People have complex emotions, and grief can be complicated. \n\nWhat your mother said is a sign of trauma bonding, which is when a person who has experienced abuse or harm develops a strong emotional connection with their abuser, making it hard for them to break away from the abusive relationship. What she said is a clear sign of this and she seems to be projecting her feelings on to you. No - there is nothing wrong with you for feeling relief, joy or whatever now that he's dead and out of your lives.\n\nYou have the right to feel whatever you're feeling - especially after 12 years of witnessing and being subjected to abuse. Your mother needs to get help with the fact that she was in an abusive relationship for over 12 years and how her choices have affected her family.", "NTA\nYour mom doesn't even understand that his death is not that bad for her. You lived a hell with him so there is no reason to grieve him. You'll be better without him and hopefully healthier.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It took over a year before I could cry for my father who I deeply loved and Hubs has never cried over the death of his abusive father. \n\nNTA", "NTA but give your mom some grace. She is processing her grief and hopefully someday will come to the realization that she was not just his partner, she was also his victim.", "You\u2019re not crazy and you\u2019re NTA, but just going off what you\u2019ve said in your post, I do not think your mom is necessarily TA. Physical domestic abuse leaves more than just physical scars and it\u2019s possible your mum is experiencing a huge whirlwind of conflicting emotions, on top of whatever she was already experiencing in a clearly abusive relationship. It\u2019ll take time and probably therapy for her to sort it out. \n\nBut it\u2019s perfectly ok not to feel grief. Everyone dies in the end, so death itself is not enough to earn someone\u2019s grief. To earn someone\u2019s grief when you die you need to have impacted their lives in a net positive way while you lived. It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepfather did that for you or your brother. It might be helpful to talk to a professional if you think you\u2019re struggling to process, but grief is not a mandatory part of it.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you're free of him.", "NTA.  You weren't emotionally attached to him & I bet part of you feels relieved that he's gone.  That's ok to feel that when your not invested in a person.  Just bc he lived with you for 12 years doesn't mean you have to grieve for him.  Especially since he was abusive.  Give yourself a break.  It's ok to not feel any sadness about his passing.  Your feelings are valid.", "Sounds like you and your brother should be having a party. NTA", "NTA.\n\nCheck out the song \"Requiem\" from Dear Evan Hansen\n\nIt's a song talk about much the same feeling. That you don't have to grieve a person that was \"family\" if they were an asshole in life.", "Everyone deals with death differently, especially depending on the relationship. Sometimes, while not politically correct to say outside of the privacy of your own  head, some deaths result in relief feelings. I wouldn't ever condone saying it out loud, but it is what it is. You can always brush it off to mom that you and sibling are just trying to be strong for her and then make a cup of tea for her.", "NTA. Everyone processes grief differently, and it\u2019s not wrong to not feel grief over someone who wasn\u2019t a positive presence in your life. \n\nYou said by the end even your mom hated him. Grief can do weird things to people. It can cause them to look back with rose colored glasses because of guilt or the social pressure to act a certain way or not \u201cspeak ill of the dead.\u201d She might be thinking \u201cthis is what you\u2019re *supposed to* do\u201d rather than thinking about logically why you might not be too torn up about him not being in your life anymore. Even when we know better, I think sometimes our brains default to those deeply ingrained social expectations when we\u2019re in serious distress or panicked. \n\nYou\u2019re not crazy. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Take care of yourself.", "Makes me wonder why mom is so upset and crying about the death of her abuser. Talk about being crazy.....", "I did in fact cry over his death, hell i cried the hardest when they pronounced him as dead, all right next to my mom. I\u2019m gonna try not to take her words to heart seeing as she\u2019s definitely not in the best headspace right now."]}
