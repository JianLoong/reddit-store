YTA", "This! The fact that she refers to herself as grandma while talking to the kids is awesome. It also confirms for them that she wants to be addressed as grandma. She very obviously loves them.", "Correct. This has zero to do with \u201cgrandma doesn\u2019t like that\u201d", "Its a habit that you get when there is a new baby so they can pick up on what to call everyone. You cant just say \"I\"", "When kids are tiny, it\u2019s also a way of teaching them your name or what to call you. OP didn\u2019t mention how old her kids are. The habit may persist but big deal. She said her MIL was \u201cnice and everything,\u201d but that\u2019s not good enough. I hope she reads some of the MIL/GMIL horror stories here about people being treated like shit and learns to count her blessings.", "Or it could be that kids have a hard time with you and me when they are going.\n\nDon't know the ages here but my kid only just got hang of he she at 4.", "Not that it would change anything to your comment. The kids are hers from a previous relationship/marriage. \n\n What you said remains true. She's quite something and totally an A", "I don\u2019t think they are her husband\u2019s kids", "Oh please. You must speak as I deem acceptable or you shall never see my children again. Blowing up a loving relationship over this? Ridiculous", "OP just blew up a potential lovefest of a family for a stupid reason.", "My daughter referred to herself as \u2018you\u2019 exclusively for a while, because I always said \u2018do you want to\u2026\u2019. She\u2019s only just starting to say \u2018I want..\u2019 rather than \u2018you want\u2026\u2019.", "Oh I didn't catch that. Then she'll be TA to her kids how love their grandma and her stories.", "Possibly two relationships after the dispute with her husband.", "Sometimes when I think I\u2019ve done something drastically stupid and embarrassing I read scenarios like this and get a confidence boost.\n\nEdit: YTA", "According to my parents, I did this too. I thought \"you\" was my name for a while.", "Definitely.  She is still TA to her MIL and to her kids. Those kids have a grandma figure who loves them and treat them as her own. \n\nWhat a stupid hill to die on. A total overreaction. \n\nAnd she would still be TA if they were her husband kids.", "Yup, I know I\u2019d be rethinking things if I were the husband."]}
