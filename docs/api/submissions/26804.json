I'm a grandma - please don't use age as an excuse for prejudices.

Have a conversation with great grandma and talk to her about your life and where you are. Let her know what is going on. It can go either way, but I think you have a right to know where she stands. The news isn't going to kill her. Further, you don't know when she's going to die, so how long exactly would this moratorium on HRT be. It could be a month, a year, ten years, or maybe even longer.

My grandma was so excited for me, and *so* kind and welcoming to my then-girlfriend.

You shouldn't have to wait or hide just in case she might get upset or feel uncomfortable--to do that would make *you* upset, and much more than uncomfortable.

My other set of grandparents died before I even knew I was queer, and I wonder a lot of about how they would have felt about it, so I get that, and if that's how you feel, I think it's much better to know than to wonder-- in addition, of course, to all the other reasons why you absolutely should not feel obliged to wait any longer to start HRT and transition in the way *you* want to.", "You are living your life making decisions to make yourself happy. life is short.
