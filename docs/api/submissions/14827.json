In our area, we are experiencing record heat. My daughters wanted to go in the poll and asked if their cousins could come and if we could have a BBQ. I called my siblings (51F and 53F) and asked about it, they said they could bring my nieces and nephews but they had an impotent scheduled lunch. The kids all went in the pool for a bit and then decided they wanted to go to a restaurant. There were 2 groups of kids, my daughters and one of my nephews (13M) and a group with the 4 other kids, each group wanted to go to a different restaurant. My wife and I gave them money while we stayed in the house.\n\nWhen my nephew got back, he told me he needed to speak to me about what went down while he was gone.\n\nMy daughters and nephew went to a local place that serves lunch and ice cream. When they got to the restaurant, my nephew noticed one of his classmates was sitting alone and asked if he wanted to join them. This classmate is dating a boy on my nephew\u2019s lacrosse team. My nephew said him and this boy were friends for a few months before the boy started dating his friend. He said the boy is in his science class and they have labs together and that he\u2019s a very funny guy.\n\nThe issue is the boy wears makeup and nail polish, my daughters were making fun of him for it. They were making snarky remarks about his looks. When he left to go to the bathroom, they used some very homophobic language, including some derogatory names. My nephew told them to stop multiple times. This boy is also a classmate of my daughter\u2019s as they are in the same grade.\n\nI was extremely angry when I heard this, I told my daughters to go to their rooms and that they were banned from the pool for today and possibly longer. My wife then stepped in and asked to speak to me, she said I should reconsider but I told her I wasn\u2019t going to. We argued for a bit until she agreed to the punishment. My nephew asked if he could bring his friend over and we let him. The boys played with the other kids until everyone left.\n\nWhen I told my sister about what had happened, I expected her to be proud of her son and told her what happened. She said she was happy that he \u201cstood for his beliefs\u201d but thought we were tough too tough on our daughters, as the friend can \u201cbe a bit flamboyant\u201d and \u201cvery talkative and loud\u201d. She wasn\u2019t wrong that he\u2019s loud and talkative, but I thought that it was probably just ADHD. I said that didn\u2019t excuse what they did and while she agreed that homophobia was bad, she said we should reconsider the groundings because it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d for girls to gossip about boy\u2019s looks.\n\nI\u2019m wondering now if I\u2019m the a-hole. I just want to protect the boy, especially from my youngest daughter bc they\u2019re classmates. My nephew said that his lacrosse friends will \u201cmake sure\u201d he\u2019s safe.", "created_utc": 1681522792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mlhfg/aita_for_banning_my_kids_from_the_pool/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One day of no pool for being little bigots?? They got off super easy and I\u2019m shocked at the rest of adults in your family. Good on you OP for defending what\u2019s right.", "NTA. As a middle school teacher, the amount of blatant homophobia running rampant in our schools is disgusting. I\u2019ve had students attempt suicide due to it. Your nephew did the right thing, and just as importantly YOU did too. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for not downplaying it.", "NTA. That wasn't just \"gossiping about boys\" that was being bigoted and mean, and deserved punishment.\n\nIt's good that you took it seriously.", "NTA, plain and simple. The world needs more of you.", "NTA. Your nephew is an impressive human.", "NTA. You are a good parent. Kids need to know from an early age every action has consequences. If you do nothing, they will think it is ok and keep doing the same thing.", "NTA: OP, Your nephew is a prince. Now is a good time for an indepth conversation with your girls about accepting others who seem \"different\" and appreciating differences in order to learn and broaden their perspectives.", "NTA. Remembering what it was like to be the different kid, it would have meant the world to me if an adult stood up for me like that.", "NTA\n\nSo much NTA\n\nYou are teaching your children that there are consequences of their actions. The consequences of not accepting people is being isolated", "You're not the asshole\nYou are teaching an important lesson to your girls\nI don't think you should keep grounding them but rather have an open disscussion about the topic and make sure they understand why what they did was wrong", "NTA. You did right. Your daughters need to learn that kind of language is not acceptable. That isn't gossiping about boys. That's being homophobic.", "NTA at all\n\nYou're a good guy and a good dad. This behavior needs to be corrected immediately", "NTA - You were right, and I will say it louder for the ones in the back.   We should not \"normalize\" being mean.  Ever!", "NTA your daughters are just homophobic", "NTA\n\nYou are the only adult having an appropriate reaction. I care very little about my own children using curse words (within reason), but I will absolutely not accept any slurs or derogatory language. If I found out they were treating someone this way I would immediately re-evaluate my parenting skills.", "So nta, the world need more people like you. I do agree with the other commenter that you and your girls need to have a conversation about what they were doing and why it was wrong. Kids have literally been driven to harming themselves because of the hurtful words of their peers, and this wasn\u2019t gossip, it was straight up bullying and homophobia", "NTA. Your daughters should face consequences for homophobia. You did the right thing.", "NTA good on you squashing that homophobia crap when you see it. Stick to your guns and explain to them exactly why you banned them, and that anything even close to that kind of talk will result in more severe punishments in the future.", "NTA. You are telling your daughters that their behavior will not be tolerated, and it shouldn't be tolerated. Thank you for looking out for the friend.", "NTA. I would also ground my kids for this behavior. Your daughters have received the message that it\u2019s acceptable to bully other kids. You don\u2019t seem to have that opinion, so, I wonder where they learned it from? You might want to consider how, and with whom, they spend their time.", "NTA: They'll live without the pool, as many others do everyday. Actions have consequences, also it is not \"normal\" to gossip about others, it's gross.", "NTA - one afternoon without pool privileges seems almost light to me. Good to hear about a parent taking action to stop bullying. Bullying and being mean to classmates needs to be stopped no matter the reason someone might be targeted as a victim.", "NTA but I think you need to talk to your daughters more than you need to ban them from the pool. They need to understand why they were wrong. Instead, they are going to consider themselves the victims in this story.", "Well I see where your girls get their homophobia. You are NTA. But you and your wife are definitely not on the same page", "NTA\nWhat on earth is the matter with your wife and sister?", "NTA. This is why drag shows are important\u2026because a little makeup and dancing never hurt anyone, but being a mean-spirited bigot can hurt a lot of people.

Well I do think you should reconsider it but I think you are nonetheless correct. In my opinion your sister is arguing in favor in the idea that traditional sex norms are valid if not actually good. I in no way denigrate that position. Her argument is ill-suited to this situation because of the discrimination and hate speech present that attacks someone's very soul. I believe your sister's position if applied would lead to mixed messages that reward the wrong conduct. If you give a lesser punishment in part because the boy is femme gay, then what you are promoting is name calling and slurs *because* someone is femme gay.\n\nIt's a critical situation that requires an immediate response. You have done something about the immediate problem. I hope when you put some thought into the situation, a good teaching or lesson that your children can reflect on will come of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
