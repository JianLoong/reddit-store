Reasons including: smell, feeling funky, potential for female smegma/clitty liter, knowing I've used the bathroom and now a person is up close and personal on my genitals, feeling sexier just knowing confidently I am clean, etc. My partner is the same.

Yeah I'm probably gonna hit the shower before I get into my bed. To me it feels the same as washing or sanitizing my hands before I touch my face or eat etc when I know I've recently touched like, a public handrail. Also freaks me out a bit that you work in medicine and don't like showering, even after the pandemic? \n\nI guess my judgment is NAH.

Another comment states this too. My supervising professors would not tolerate me being smelly around patients either since the patients are paying for our services. This is why I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t smell.", "I can\u2019t believe people are justifying not washing their skin every day. It\u2019s so ridiculous. I\u2019m shocked to read just how disgusting so many women are on this thread.", "I think it\u2019s extreme to break up with him over this, especially when we are compatible in many many other and more important ways. He is in no way abusive or excessively rude about it. If he wants to break up with me over it then that\u2019s fine, though I doubt that\u2019s the case.", "Is someone who showers every other day meaningfully less clean than someone who showers every day, though? Like assuming they aren\u2019t going out getting super sweaty every day or rolling in actual filth. I really find it hard to believe that it would be true.", "Correct, which is why I shower every other day despite not being raised to. I changed my habits for the better but my preference did not change.", "This is true, though I\u2019ve noticed that Americans in general are very fussy about showering so I have always felt I should respect that too. But I also know many Americans that shower every other day, so I also think that\u2019s enough?", "Yeah re-reading the comment it was stupid to assume they meant a complete shower. Although to be fair, I\u2019m slow regardless of my hair so it doesn\u2019t really matter.", "I think it hid in the polyester weave. \ud83d\ude02", "I know you don't need it now, but for anyone else in this predicament, soak the clothes in steaming hot water with 1 Tbsp of dish soap and 1/4 cup of Borax. Then wash as normal, or for even better results add some vinegar to the abric softener compartment of the washer. Works wonders for oils. (I use it to get rid of sheet stank)", "Rustic is the polite way of putting it\u2026", "Yeah wtf? Could be that they were very busy but even then it takes 2 minutes to brush your teeth so he could\u2019ve saved his breath apologizing.", "I\u2019m the odd the duck that loves the smell of onions XD I actually commented on it once cuz I had customers who those tuna sandwiches from Erbert\u2019s and Gerberts they were like omg\nI\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m like nah you good I love onions lol", "I'm a woman, and a PhD in microbiology, and I shower about twice a week. There is absolutely no need other than personal preference for most people to shower every day.", "It's true that ideally he'd be the one to call this a deal-breaker or not. I'm just concerned that nicknames like \"stinky girl\" might be getting into your head more than you realize. I think it's pretty clear that he's getting more insistent because, as this continues, he's realizing more & more how much he cares about this issue.\n\nIf you care about the fact that he's upset, you need to have a real, sit-down conversation with him about it, and you need to be open to the fact that your hygiene might legitimately be a deal-breaker for him. But if he doesn't want to break up over this, you need to decide what kind of behavior you're willing to tolerate here, because this disagreement isn't going to go away. For example, you might ask if he's able to deal with his feelings *without* giving you the cold shoulder... or is he going to make ruin your night every time it happens for the rest of your lives? Are you really okay with \"stinky girl\"? Do your showering practices make him not want to have sex? Does that make you feel undesirable? Etc.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll break up with him over this but I do think he might break up with you.  These self- care routines are cultural for sure and we all have different norms.  It doesn\u2019t seem like your norms match up and it\u2019s really starting to get to him.", "I don't think OP is \"meaningfully less clean\" than her partner. But it's clear that *he* absolutely does.", "There's a large group of Americans who don't think you need to wash your feet when you shower. You're not in the wrong here IMO.", "YES!", "If you eat something pungent like garlic or onions, brushing your teeth won't necessarily get rid of the smell. The odor travels up from your stomach.", "Revolting!! Absolutely revolting."]}
