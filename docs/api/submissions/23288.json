Reasons including: smell, feeling funky, potential for female smegma/clitty liter, knowing I've used the bathroom and now a person is up close and personal on my genitals, feeling sexier just knowing confidently I am clean, etc. My partner is the same.

Yeah I'm probably gonna hit the shower before I get into my bed.

Also freaks me out a bit that you work in medicine and don't like showering, even after the pandemic? \n\nI guess my judgment is NAH.

You gotta worry about someone not bathing 3 times a day when I can assure you there\u2019s a redditor somewhere out there who hasn\u2019t showered in months?", "Dudes just mad that he doesn\u2019t have time to spend doing anything other than being miserable", "No, *you* shower to get clean and *you* take a bath to relax. Washing my hair takes a while. You have to let the conditioner sit. I\u2018m a woman so I shave sometimes. Sometimes I literally just stand in the water and feel it hitting me and enjoying the feeling of it or how the warm water feels nice, etc. Stop shitting on people who do things that you don\u2019t."]}
