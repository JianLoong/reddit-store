After a short time an unexpected thunderstorm blew in.  The river went from calm\nAnd smooth to rapids and hail/heavy rain within minutes.  When that happened the entire group got scattered.  I lost track of my wife, but saw her drifting over to others in our group.  You could visually observe the water levels rising as the conditions got worse.

Well, the group got separated and scattered.  Where we were, there was nowhere we could get out of the river.  So I had to swim/ pull my tube(laying on top of his tube as a cover) and his tube with him in it for approx 30 minutes, in some pretty fierce water to get to a point that we could get out.  We got out, and had to hike a pretty good distance through some rough terrain to get back to the roadway.  Later, after searching quite a bit, we found the rest of the group along with my wife.  Was she upset that I left her and focused 100% on getting my son to safety? No, she was pretty damned happy that I actually did what I said I would do in those hypothetical conversations.

Thanks for giving me the chance to reflect on this.\" Then walk away.", "NTA.  Your wife is insecure.  Also, she should want you to save the very young children first.  As an adult, she would probably have a better chance of getting herself out of the situation than your children.  But, instead she is being snappy and not talking to you.   That's not a good look for her.  I'd probably just keep going about my business, and if she starts something, tell her that you expect her to act better than your actual children", "Assuming an answer is required, the logical response is to save the oldest victim, i.e. the wife.\n\nThe wife already has 35 years of experience and intellectual property under her belt. The kids have nearly none so are more or less useless. The investment in the kids is negligible and the wife is young enough to have more. Infant mortality used to be far worse than it is these days, it's just a romantic notion that we should save the kids first.\n\nTo put it real bluntly, if you were washed up on a desert island and you could only save wife or kids, who do you save? The wife could assist in building a hut, hunting, cooking, and you could create more kids. A couple of under 10 year olds, you'd all be dead in a couple of months.\n\nEDIT. Forgot to add, because you gave the wrong answer, YTA.", "Info:\nWhat is attractive about this person? Why\u2026are you with a preteen that\u2019s really gross.", "Nta, first bc she kept pushing after being asked to drop it, and second for being angry bc you said your kids.", "NTA. I hate hypotheticals. My ex-friend did this to me by asking if I'd save my fiancee or her kid. I obviously picked the person who mattered most to me - my fiancee!\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes, your wife learnt that the hard way.", "ESH - you only for making her feel stupid. But the question is really ridiculous.", "YTA.\n\nIt doesn't sound like she's upset at your answer, she's upset that you kept telling her that her scenario was stupid.  Since you missed the point of what upset her I'd say AH.", "Yta. It's a stupid question, you're right. You were doomed to lose. Say her and you apparently dont love the kids. Say the kids and you dont love her.\n\nAnd tbh there IS only 1 right answer as a parent and that is the kids.", "YTA for even answering this shit test.  I will never for the life of me, understand why men answer these shit tests?  Makes no sense to me.", "Or honestly, DO answer the question, and answer it correctly. This was the right response! I have an 8 month old and my husband and I have both openly said that we would save our baby over each other without hesitation if that situation ever arose. How would the wife have felt if he said he'd save her over the kids?\n\nOP, maybe go back and ask her what SHE would do. I bet her answer is the same as yours.", "Lol my husband and me had this hypothetical question on our first date and when I told him the kids he was like, \"Thank God I was going to tell you to save the f****** kids and don't worry about me.\"", "Okay, this is funny and all (looooove PB references! ) \n\nBut can we stop normalizing \n\n1) the idea that any (toxic) *person* who sets up their partner to fail should be humored At All.\n\n2) that this is normal behavior for women.\n\nPlus, Wife here is f*cking despicable", "As a mother and a wife - in this scenario though, I'd be really disappointed in my husband if he'd say he'd save me. Of course the kids come first, that's a no brainer.", "I snorted with laughter! Love this", "This is my favourite ever answer.", "This. But, also, OP, what kind of mom doesn't want her kids saved? I'd be looking at your wife a little more closely...", "NTA, its same trap as \"do i look fatter?\"", "I wish I had an award to give!!!", "Exactly! The only situation where it is advised to do the opposite is when there is oxygen depravation (like on a plane) you literally have to save yourself so you can stay conscious enough to save your kids. Otherwise it is always the kids first! Op is NTA.", "My thoughts too, mom comes first over a baby. That\u2019s the logical response, over the emotional one.", "Wow, okay, I know the sub needs to give definite answer since that\u2019s the whole point, but based on what we know I wouldn\u2019t say you can diagnose someone", "I agree that he's NTA. \n\nIsn't calling her \"a manipulative asshole\" and saying she \"needs mental help\" a little extreme?\n\nI get where you're coming from, but that seems really harsh. \n\nCalling for moderation on the internet has gotten me downvoted 100% of the time, so I fully expect you to get defensive.\n\nHowever, can we be just a little bit more balanced? Yes, her reaction wasn't great, but also, does that mean that she is a terrible person and mentally unstable?

She was fishing for an answer she wouldn't get.", "Just a word of advice: SOMETHING is bothering her and you probably need to have a serious discussion at to what it is. Sit her down and say something like \"honey, I KNOW you're not actually mad at me for saving the kids in this hypothetical situation, so what is it that is ACTUALLY on your mind? Playing games and not telling me is unproductive, so please tell me the truth here so we can discuss this like the adults we are\"", "She has either fell victim to tiktok brain rot or she is looking for an excuse to be mad at you", "Just lie and say you\u2019d ripe the gate off your house if it meant saving all 3 bc she\u2019s obviously thinking of Dwayne  The Rock Johnson in a disaster movie and not real life", "Is she pregnant?", "Dude her response to you says more about her than anything.  Yikes!", "I does seem stupid. I would always save a child before an adult even if said child isn\u2019t mine.", "Is there a chance she's pregnant?", "what was that robot movie, will smith hated robots because one saved him over some random kid, and *any human being* would know to save a child first...\n\nNTA, I don't know what your wife's on, but it's not a good look.", "NTA, but I separate that from your frustration at this (predictable) result.\n\nHer goal was not to remain happy at all costs; it was to find out what you think.", "What bothers me the most with OP's post is that **she'd want him to leave their CHILDREN in danger to save her.**\n\nWTAF? Some people shouldn't be parents. Poor kids.", "Sorry after 36 years of marriage I have learned. No spouse should ever answer hypothetical questions like this one. It is a no win situation.", "I don\u2019t even have my own kids yet, but isn\u2019t it just pretty common knowledge that you always save the kids first.

Not once you\u2019re married with school-age children; that\u2019s a hell of a time to find out your spouse thinks they\u2019re more important/worth saving than your children.\n\nNTA OP", "Thank you! I opined in another sub that \"does this make me look fat?\" is a trick question, and got downvoted/roasted for it. \n\n\nNTA, OP.", "It also has the vibe of getting mad at your partner because you dreamed they were cheating on you.", "I like the \"do these clothes make me look fat\", no your fat makes you look fat answer.  But I would not say that.", "Was Honest Abe ever too honest?", "And you think only women ask stupid questions?", "The judgement you're responding to is literally \"NTA\" which means the other person (the wife) is inherently the asshole.", "Ha!!! Ok I was having a shit start to the day and you two just lifted me up.", "This is the Pareto optimal solution.", "Sounds like a question a \"good friend\" had brought up, who is now on the sideline, watching as the drama unravels.

I would HOPE my husband answered that. What is wrong with the person that you are married to? Does she even like your kids?", "That\u2019s valid. I don\u2019t mean to say this person is mentally unstable, but to be full blown mad at your partner over this question is a red flag.", "I didn\u2019t say she was necessarily a terrible person, but to literally get upset and give OP silent treatment over this ridiculous question is a red flag. She might need mental help from their relationship. Maybe she feels insecure. I have no idea. But asking your partner this type of question and getting that upset over their response to save their own children seems extreme.", "Btw I would not downvote your comment. It was respectful and I think it\u2019s a valid opinion.", ">She says I\u2019m an AH for being \u2018unfeeling\u2019 and \u2018callous\u2019 and that I am belittling her for calling the question stupid\n\nI mean just read it.\n\nAgreed the scenario was stupid.", "Yes! This is the question OP needs to be asking her, I can't imagine this is really about her stupid question.", "ding ding, people rarely throw shit out like this and then catch feelings over the answer without having something specific on their mind.", "Yep, something is on her mind.

Granted, I haven't been married as long as you for sure.  But generally, don't ask questions you don't want the answer to.  She set him up to fail and punish him.

I remember telling the doctors to save both but to make sure my wife doesn't die. It was such a high adrenaline moment and I couldn't have imagined losing my wife that day. Fortunately they were both saved and we have 3 kids now. At this point I would try to save my kids first.", "Absolutely! My wife and I have already decided that her former-track-running butt is to get the kids out of danger and my slow,  rice-crispies bones-having ass is to slow down whatever is threatening them.", "I just assumed this was the standing instruction with all adults/kids.

Should she not be considered more likely to be able to save herself?", "Agreed.", "The point of my \"when my kids were young\" was that the standing instructions applied to born children.

Thank goodness everyone is okay!", "Yup.  The zombies get to devour me while husband and kids get away.", "Pupper as in a dog?", "Meanwhile I\u2019m like you\u2019d better choose saving me over saving the cats bc our actual child needs me more than the cats.

My mum has dementia and doesnt know who i am anymore. So no, it probs wouldnt be worth it for her.\n\nAnd regardless of ALL that, my dog IS my kid. And she is a capable of fear and pain. Any chance that in a situation where my tiny, scared puppy is in pain and my hubs could save her, he better take it."]}
