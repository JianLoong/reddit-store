After a short time an unexpected thunderstorm blew in.  The river went from calm\nAnd smooth to rapids and hail/heavy rain within minutes.  When that happened the entire group got scattered.  I lost track of my wife, but saw her drifting over to others in our group.  You could visually observe the water levels rising as the conditions got worse.

Well, the group got separated and scattered.  Where we were, there was nowhere we could get out of the river.  So I had to swim/ pull my tube(laying on top of his tube as a cover) and his tube with him in it for approx 30 minutes, in some pretty fierce water to get to a point that we could get out.  We got out, and had to hike a pretty good distance through some rough terrain to get back to the roadway.  Later, after searching quite a bit, we found the rest of the group along with my wife.  Was she upset that I left her and focused 100% on getting my son to safety? No, she was pretty damned happy that I actually did what I said I would do in those hypothetical conversations.
