That's putting all the onus on other people to be mature and cater to these \"tests\" and no responsibility on the highly immature, insecure person to get some therapy and learn to say \"hey, I'm feeling kind of down, could you cheer me up a bit?\"\n\nInteresting that you put the impetus on OP to learn communicate clearly while acknowledging that the wife can't. Why is she faultless in this? How is it not a problem that she has to disguise this need with \"tests\"? If she's that insecure and in need of validation, that's something she needs to discuss with a therapist, not take out on OP.", "When someone like the wife is taking the question THAT seriously, there no \u201cbetter strategy.\u201d Given how upset she got over this question means she was always going to be upset over him picking the kids. \n\nOn top of that, the fact shes taking it so serious and is upset over the fact his answer is the kids in this dumb hypothetical makes her an AH\n\nWhy would it be anything but the kids", "Completely agree with you!", "It just takes one person being kind to completely change the trajectory of a conversation. To me, OPs wife seems insecure, but not unkind. OP was openly unkind, over and over again. I would not feel emotionally safe in a relationship with him, and it\u2019s clear to me that his wife doesn\u2019t either.", "She\u2019s upset because he\u2019s avoiding the question, communicating badly, and handling the situation badly. She wants a partner she can admire, who can handle hard questions like this, who can reassure her that he knows his priorities, and who feels confident in his answers. Even if OP can\u2019t organically be all of those things, he could at the very least communicate with love. \n\nSometimes partners ask for reassurance over and over and over. Patience and kindness and clear communication is always a better strategy than just avoiding it and calling it stupid. She\u2019s lost so much faith in him.", "Its not a hard question dude. Its a meaningless middle school level of thinking hypothetical question that begins and ends with \u201cid save the kids first, and then come back to try and save you.\u201d \n \nIf she wants an adult conversation about assurance, reliability, and communication than she needs to be an adult and ask an adult question. \n\nNot a hypothetical question you find on the back of a teen magazine"]}
