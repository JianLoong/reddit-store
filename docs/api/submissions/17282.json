I enjoy her company. She\u2019s been my best friend for the past year. But I have another best friend, who we\u2019ll call Jake(19M). We have feelings for each other and have agreed that we both have too much going on right now to date. We still hang out very often. Amy and Jake HATE each other.  \nAnyways, Amy started doing little things that I would brush off. She would insist that I ride with her if all our friends were going somewhere. She insists that we have to hang out every other day. She will get very touchy if one of our other friends has been. We have a group of 9 people and are all very touchy, so it didn\u2019t bother me.  \nShe\u2019d get upset if I was hanging out with someone else. She then started to track my snapchat location. Which I brushed off. On one occasion, I was out of town with my brother; she texted me asking why my location was off. I didn\u2019t realize it was and told her that. She asked me if I was with Jake. I said no. She then told me that I must be lying and with Jake and didn\u2019t want her to know. I took a picture with my brother flipping her off. As soon as I sent that to her, I turned it off permanently.   \nThen Amy was inviting everyone over but excluding Jake. And I feel like it was to punish me, I know that they hate each other, but they get along just fine when everyone is together and she had no problem inviting him before. Jake then felt like everyone didn\u2019t want him there when that wasn\u2019t the case at all.  \nI brought this up to her, and she said that it was her place and she didn\u2019t have to explain to anyone why she didn\u2019t invite someone. I said that was fine, but she could at least take Jake\u2019s feelings into account or at least give me a reason, so I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s targeted at me.  \nShe told me that it wasn\u2019t targeted to hurt me or Jake, but that we spend too much time together and that she was just giving us a break. I said that it hurt us regardless of her intentions and that she didn\u2019t get to decide who I hang out with.  \nShe then said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d  \nI just got so angry and yelled at her that her mental illness was not an excuse to act like we\u2019re dating.  \nShe then yelled back at me that it had everything to do with her mental illness and that she had every right to be overprotective and that she wasn\u2019t acting like we were dating, she was acting like my friend.  \nI left her place after that, slamming the door on my way out.  \nOur friend group is slightly torn over this. Half are on my side. The other half are saying I took it too far and since Amy has BPD, I should have been gentler about it.   \nAmy isn\u2018t talking to me right now. And through another one of our friends, she has been a mess.
