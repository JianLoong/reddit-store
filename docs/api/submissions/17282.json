I enjoy her company. She\u2019s been my best friend for the past year. But I have another best friend, who we\u2019ll call Jake(19M). We have feelings for each other and have agreed that we both have too much going on right now to date. We still hang out very often. Amy and Jake HATE each other.  \nAnyways, Amy started doing little things that I would brush off. She would insist that I ride with her if all our friends were going somewhere. She insists that we have to hang out every other day. She will get very touchy if one of our other friends has been. We have a group of 9 people and are all very touchy, so it didn\u2019t bother me.  \nShe\u2019d get upset if I was hanging out with someone else. She then started to track my snapchat location. Which I brushed off. On one occasion, I was out of town with my brother; she texted me asking why my location was off. I didn\u2019t realize it was and told her that. She asked me if I was with Jake. I said no. She then told me that I must be lying and with Jake and didn\u2019t want her to know. I took a picture with my brother flipping her off. As soon as I sent that to her, I turned it off permanently.   \nThen Amy was inviting everyone over but excluding Jake. And I feel like it was to punish me, I know that they hate each other, but they get along just fine when everyone is together and she had no problem inviting him before. Jake then felt like everyone didn\u2019t want him there when that wasn\u2019t the case at all.  \nI brought this up to her, and she said that it was her place and she didn\u2019t have to explain to anyone why she didn\u2019t invite someone. I said that was fine, but she could at least take Jake\u2019s feelings into account or at least give me a reason, so I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s targeted at me.  \nShe told me that it wasn\u2019t targeted to hurt me or Jake, but that we spend too much time together and that she was just giving us a break. I said that it hurt us regardless of her intentions and that she didn\u2019t get to decide who I hang out with.  \nShe then said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d  \nI just got so angry and yelled at her that her mental illness was not an excuse to act like we\u2019re dating.  \nShe then yelled back at me that it had everything to do with her mental illness and that she had every right to be overprotective and that she wasn\u2019t acting like we were dating, she was acting like my friend.  \nI left her place after that, slamming the door on my way out.  \nOur friend group is slightly torn over this. Half are on my side. The other half are saying I took it too far and since Amy has BPD, I should have been gentler about it.   \nAmy isn\u2018t talking to me right now. And through another one of our friends, she has been a mess. I feel awful, but I still think I\u2019m in the right here.", "created_utc": 1684122037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hwiy8/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_we_arent_dating/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But also as someone with BDP, having it does NOT excuse you from your poor behavior. It\u2019s her responsibility to get help (and if she cannot, at least her responsibility to try to keep it in check).

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with BPD since I was 16 or 17. I\u2019ve had favorite people since I was a child, most of it presented as kind of Single White Female-ish in the way of adopting the person\u2019s personality, style, likes and dislikes. I completely lacked insight into this behavior until I was in my mid 20\u2019s. Once I realized I was doing this, I would frequently check in with myself to make sure I wasn\u2019t taking on someone else\u2019s personality or behaving possessively. Your friend is aware of this behavior but doesn\u2019t seem to be working on it even though it\u2019s affecting others while using BPD as an excuse. Though pwBPD can have intense and unstable interpersonal relationships, it\u2019s still something that the person needs to monitor within themself in order to form more stable friendships and romantic relationships. BPD may explain the behaviors, but that doesn\u2019t make what she\u2019s doing okay. Yelling isn\u2019t great, but avoiding the conversation entirely would probably end up with a worse outcome.", "NTA.\nAmy should be in therapy.", "NTA - she knows she has issues and I'm assuming is not seeking any help. That's on her as a grown ass adult. Responsibility even with mental illness matters.", "NTA. You are not an emotional support animal. You should not be at her beck and call.

Her actions are not your responsibility. Have you ever read \"Stop Walking on Eggshells\"? Have your friends? I recommend it. You are not wrong.

I have BPD and have never acted like that with someone. Yes, I can come a little overly attached but not to the point of obsession. This is too much and definitely does not give her the right to decide who you can and can not hang out with.

I'm not like that now and my bestie is still my favourite person but I know she has time for me when she gets to me. We text everyday even if its just a are you ok text.

Yes, absolutely.", "ESH. She doesn\u2019t have to invite people she doesn\u2019t like to her house.", "Hmmm this is a tough one. I have BPD and I\u2019ll admit I get obsessive about certain people I genuinely admire. However she is being controlling and she doesn\u2019t have the right to choose your friends- to me, that aspect isn\u2019t BPD that is likely poor attachment styles and fear of abandonment or something. Does that mean you should bring mental health into the argument and blame it on her mental health? No that\u2019s not acceptable and is offensive. If you said it in a kind way this would be different but you weaponized it. So soft YTA", "ESH - Sounds like you lashed out in anger, so here's your AH tag.

So here's her AH tag.", "Info:  Are you even attracted to women?", "YTA for saying that to her in that moment but she does need to figure her shit out.\n\nDoes she know you and jake have feelings for each other? This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my comment, just curious on why she suddenly decided to start leaving him out. \n\nI will say that even if she has a person, it\u2019s still toxic to expect to have someone\u2019s fully undivided attention and be suspicious and controlling to a degree that it effects your relationships. Does she go to therapy and is she being treated? (Meds/therapy/support groups)\n\nI\u2019ve got ADHD and it comes with some severe depression and anxiety. I have my extremely small friend group and my bf but if I\u2019m ever having an anxiety attack I had to learn my grounding techniques because unloading on them and using them as my coping mechanism wasn\u2019t fair. Because it\u2019s not just about having your mental health issues, but it\u2019s also about learning to live with them in a positive way. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just how I read it but I think you both kind of weaponized it, you saying that she can\u2019t blame it on the BPD and her hiding behind that and saying that\u2019s exactly the reason she can. \nI have a few friends with BPD and it\u2019s pretty obvious out of the 3 which one doesn\u2019t get support medically. (More manic episodes, harder time reaching out, not eligible to do medication due to past addiction, no psychologist/doctors) \n\n\n\n-(I do know BPD and ADHD are not the same, but they have some comorbid symptoms so I can sort of relate?)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
