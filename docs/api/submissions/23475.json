Is he ok with the mortgage of the house if needed? If yes make sure he put his things in order on this side.", "This is dependent on location, but also there is no indication OP has actually been granted power of attorney. These are things they need to figure out should this ever happen again in the future. OP can\u2019t just decide he has power of attorney and cash out refinance or take out an equity loan on the house should the dad\u2019s health fail again, and while it isn\u2019t necessarily needed, they should consult with an attorney to make sure the form is executed correctly, because a mortgage company is going to require documentation.\n\nEdit: typo", "As long as the father still lives and gives his ok, this can be done, yeah, it's not in the son's name...", "There's probably no need to mortgage anything. The dad's bills are his and his alone (most likely, depending on local debt laws), and if he doesn't live beyond the bills, it's up to the hospital to collect from his estate, e.g. by forcing a sale of the house, assuming that's dad's only significant asset. So bro is seriously off base getting mad about the mortgage - the bills will come out of his inheritance one way or another, plus if he keeps up with the \"you can't spend MY inheritance\" BS, he'll probably find that \"his\" (not his) inheritance is zero anyway."]}
