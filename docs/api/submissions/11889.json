Their grief is real but definitely not an excuse to exhibit such controlling behaviours about your personal life and how you choose to move on. Three years is a pretty long time to wait before starting to date. \n\nI\u2019d strongly suggest putting up very strong boundaries and limiting contact between you and the in laws, nothing drastic but maybe just a weekly thing at a base level\u2026 only suggesting as you don\u2019t want them to start projecting these views on to your kids.", "NTA - You waited until YOU were right to date. This is good. You haven't rushed into your dates meeting the children. This is good.\n\nI have no idea what was actually said, but you seem to understand why they might be hurt. This is good. Now they need to see why their action are not Good.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you started dating 3 days, 3 week or 3 months after your wife died. It's 3 years.

You didn\u2019t. Your kids didn\u2019t. You still get to have a life and the opportunity to model a healthy adult relationship for your kids. Your in laws don\u2019t get to decide when you\u2019re ready to date and they don\u2019t get to impose their rules or beliefs on you. You were married to their daughter, not to them. Do be careful of them trying to sabotage your relationships with your kids and your future partner though.", "NTA and tell your in laws to mind their boundaries. You most definitely do not need their approval or permission to date again and what you do with your life is not something they can control. You do not need to wait an entire lifetime to grieve and sometimes you just need to move on. It appears that the in laws just want to take over and run the family and it might be worth pushing back a lot more on the boundaries.", "NTA \n\nGo and live your life", "NTA. They are way overstepping, and waiting three years before slowly working your way back into dating is not rushing at all. Definitely time to set some strong boundaries and enforce them. Be sure to warn anyone you are getting serious with about your inlaws.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour in Laws are probably just so gutted by the loss of their daughter. Your kids are probably in a sense keeping her alive for them, so it's natural they're going to get a little over the top about your kids.\n\nThat being said you're allowed to date, and if they want to have a cordial relationship with you and your kids, they need to accept that you're a human being too. \n\nYou dating is just another reminder that she is gone forever. It obviously is upsetting for them, but they can't blow up at you when they get upset. \n\nIs their house decently sized? Rather than having them constantly stop by your house could you bring your kids over to them a few days a week? Then you get your space and they still get to see the kids. It's chaotic having someone that isn't your direct family constantly in your space and it sounds like you are due for some time to yourself.\n\nBest of luck OP!", "NTA - you probably should have just ripped the band aid off and told them outright. Now that it is out, this is a very touchy subject for all. Them because it's the loss of their daughter and you for the loss of your wife. All of you are going to have to find a common ground from which to build your relationships going forward, because like it or not, they are in your life and will be until they die.\n\nYou might want to consider therapy for yourself if you aren't already doing so. Doing a family therapy with your in-laws could be very beneficial too in that an impartial therapist can structure the conversations in a way where all of you hear each other, because right now none of you are listening to the other.\n\nAnyway, it's your life and three years is plenty of time for a grieving period where you don't consider dating. At some point you should sit with your kids and ask them how they feel about you dating and so on to test the waters now so that you can have a plan of action should they not be happy with the news.  Good luck.", "I'm sorry for your loss, OP.\n\nNTA.

Nearly 3 years is not \"too soon\" by any standard.  But that's not something you can convince them of--so don't even try.\n\nBased on the fact that they moved so close to you, I'm going to assume they don't have other grandchildren, and possibly your wife was their only child.  Your in-laws look at your children as \"their family\" more so than \"your kids.\"  In their mind, you dating is the first step down the slippery slope of them being boxed out of ~~your kid's~~ their grandchildren's lives by the \"wicked step-mother.\"\n\nFor them, \"never\" is too soon.

If they choose not to respect them, you can go no-contact.", "NTA. Their grief is immense and I think they were kind of using the kids as shield to not feel it completely.

You don't, at all, and they're lucky you continue to allow them into your live at all considering how overbearing they've been. They need to back off.", "NTA.  There are so many ways you could have approached this and probably some of them would have resulted in a better outcome.  However, your choice is your choice and you do not have to feel guilty about it.  3 years is absolutely not too soon and you shouldn't feel like you need to tiptoe around their feelings.  You loved your wife.  If you can try to continue to talk to her parents about this that might be what is best for your family.  Perhaps you can start with a letter outlining all of your feelings.  I would do this sooner rather than later because you probably will want to know if they are ever going to be able to come around long before you enter into any sort of serious relationship with someone.  I think a counselor would probably do wonders with helping your family through this, because your children will need you to be on top of your game and they, not your former in-laws, need to come first.", "Strong NTA\n\nOnly you know when you're ready to start dating again.

You could have started dating the day after your wife passed if that\u2019s what you wanted. It\u2019s not their business to be stepping up in. 3 years is a very respectable time frame. I know they lost their daughter but losing a spouse is much worse. That\u2019s literally the person you depended on for everything. That was your partner. That was the mother to your children.

Uncharted territory and keeping to yourself on this is totally understandable.\n\nI get what you are saying about these boundaries with your in-laws, as they were there for you and kids when you needed them after your wife passed.   But it's been a few years now, and they need to understand you don't need them near as much as before.   Nor do you need their permission to start dating - wow!   I think that was just a weird comment for them to make, but perhaps a \"knee-jerk\" reaction, possibly never considering that you will eventually move on with your life.

Inlaws need to back off,  & you set those new boundaries.", "NTA for sure.  Man that sounds like an insufferable situation.

But their attitude is completely inappropriate and way over entitled.", "Absolutely NTA. But you should have talked to your in-laws. They should have heard about this in a different way. I think it would have been polite for you to tell them you were dating. You definitely didn\u2019t need their permission or approval or concerns about how it would affect the kids. I wouldn\u2019t say you need to apologize though. Even if it would have been polite, you weren\u2019t obligated to tell them you were dating.", "NTA. 3 years is a long time.

Do your in-laws expect you to stay single forever?  I believe that being willing to date again and hopefully have a relationship after your wife\u2019s death is a compliment to her. You were obviously happy in your marriage/ relationship with your wife that you are willing to be with someone else.", "I mean, I think you should ask your spouse for permission probably lol", "Yeah, I can understand their grief is immense and I think they were kind of using the kids as shield to not feel it completely, but they need to accept she is gone and life goes on.", "excellent point, i stand corrected.", "This was the best answer!", "NTA to be honest - there\u2019s absolutely no reason that your in-laws \u201cneed\u201d to know about your dating life before your kids. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they let it slip to see how the kids react to try and guilt trip you", "NTA\n\nYou wanted to wait until it was worth bringing up. I get that they are hurt and that it probably was a gut punch of a realization that their daughter really is gone forever, along with fear that someone a new woman will become their grandkids \u201cnew mom\u201d. Regardless of their feelings, their reaction was inappropriate and unfair to you.", "First off, I am so sorry to you and your kiddos, and all impacted for your loss. \n\nYou are their parent and always have been, and you make the final decisions on your lives at this point. I know their daughter is gone but that does not mean they become their mom in her place. \n\nI think they are afraid if you date they are going to somehow lose their grandkids, but from what I've read that is not the thing. Perhaps telling them that space does not equal losing their grandchildren. \n\nAnyway, NTA and obviously you owe them nothing about your dating life. You seem like you are doing about it the right way and I suspect your wife would want you to be happy in this terrible situation. Good luck.", "I think they're afraid that if you remarry, they'll lose their grandchildren because then you'll want to spend holidays and stuff with your new in-laws. But you still have the right to move on with your life. Three years is not too soon. It could be ten years and they'd still be unhappy about it. Be watchful about how they treat any girlfriend you have. They might try to drive her away or interfere with your dates. They might also manipulate your kids into disliking your girlfriend. NTA", "NTA\n\nno one can tell you when it\u2019s the right time to move on but YOU.\n\nMaybe sign of for family counseling with in laws? MIL might need some extra help. Seems like she\u2019s been diving into parenting your family to cope with the grief?", "NTA. Three years is plenty of time, and even if it wasn\u2019t, you don\u2019t need their permission. You deserve happiness. I hate to call them the AH, because it sounds like their grief is really getting in the way of their judgment here, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re being.", "NTA. Your wife had been dead for two years before you started to date.  My brother died and his wife started to date again after a while. We expected it, this is normal.  She remarried and we were thrilled. Nothing was going to bring my brother back and her kids got a wonderful stepfather.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss and the pain your in-laws are in as well. But you have every right to move on. Unfortunately for them, your dating is a reminder of exactly that: life does go on, even though their daughter is dead. They are holding on to you to keep that pain from getting too deep. \n\nMake it clear that you will always love their daughter, and nothing will change that. Maybe establish a special weekend, once a month, just for you and your kids to spend time with them. Visit your wife's grave with them occasionally. At the same time, keep very specific boundaries. They cannot come over every day, or whenever they like. Explain to them that the more they try to be possessive of your love and attention, the more they will push you away. \n\nGood luck!", "Nta!", "Ridiculous inlaws have no say over your life.   Why are you asking?", "NTA. You don't need their permission to date. You need to set boundaries and make it clear that dropping by is no longer an option. Limit them to a couple of visits a week at prior arrangement.", "NTA. That is their grief being projected onto you. You are allowed to find happiness, you do NOT need their permission.", "NTA. None of their business. I get that they are probably still grieving your late wife but that does not give them the veto on how you are living your life years after her passing.  From the way you describe their regular presence in your home you have been more than accommodating to them, and giving them plenty of access to the grand kids. It may be time to start separating them a little from your day to day life.  Good luck.", "NTA, tell them specifically what you told us, \u201cI wanted to see how I felt about it before I brought them into it.\u201d Tell them you plan on keeping them in your family\u2019s life and see them as family, but you can\u2019t be alone forever. (If that\u2019s how you feel anyway)\n\nYou would be the asshole though if dating means further boundaries you\u2019re going to set up without talking to them about it and explaining first.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and told me that I should have asked for their permission before I started dating again\" .. This is COMPLETELY unreasonable. Ignore that AH.", "NTA. You\u2019re starting slowly, you have no intention of introducing a new partner to your kids unless it\u2019s serious. And you\u2019re lonely.\n\nYou do not need your in-laws permission. What they want is to pretend there\u2019s something YOU could do to keep them from being upset you\u2019re dating. That\u2019s not possible. \n\nThey will never, ever stop grieving their baby died. It just doesn\u2019t work like that. And they\u2019re going to grieve horribly as you date, and if you marry again, even if it\u2019s 20 years later. And that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s normal. What\u2019s not ok is to put that on you.\n\nI would strongly push your MIL towards grief therapy. Use words like \u201cthis will help you focus on the best part of [wife]\u2019s life and celebrate her\u201d. Many grieving people feel like being told they\u2019ll \u201cget better\u201d is like being told they need to stop caring.\n\nOnce your in-laws have stopped panicking, I would reassure them they will ALWAYS have a place in the lives of your children. That you think it\u2019s vital your kids know where they, and their mother, came from, and who they are as a family. \n\nI would also suggest that your in-laws are a 5th/6th date conversation. \u201cMy children\u2019s grandparents are physically and emotionally close. Their presence in my kid\u2019s life is non-negotiable. They can be overbearing, but I will take responsibility to manage their nonsense. I know that dealing with the family of a former spouse can be a lot, so I wanted to make sure you knew before this relationship developed further.\u201d\n\nLots of posts on this board about step-parents struggling to deal with the family of a deceased former partner, so make sure that\u2019s laid out.\n\nAnd I want to add: you may never marry again. You may find that dinner and a few drinks with pleasant company is all you want. As long as you\u2019re up-front and kind with your partners, I assure you there are women looking for the exact same thing.", "NTA. It's time to set some boundaries with them. If they want to see the grandkids they have to arrange it with you ahead of time. No more just showing up. No more everyday visits. You're giving them grounds for grandparents visitation. Well, even more so. And your instance because you're a widow or depending on the state they could already have it. You giving them daily access could have put things more in their favor.", "3 years is plenty of time for healing, you still have to live your life", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sure they are seeing it as \u201cwe can\u2019t get a new daughter and they are trying to replace her\u201d not understanding that it isn\u2019t how that works. They are grieving and trying to force you to grieve the same way.", "NTA\n\nThey are a big part of your life, and I expect the kids (and therefore also you) get real benefit from this, even if you need **some** space from them.\n\nThis only means that open communication is a big deal, especially if you think the topic will be a problem.\n\nDecide how involved in your and your kids' life you want them to be going forward.  They do sound important.\n\nYou are not, or should not be, ashamed of dating, or ashamed of your kids, or of your late wife's parents.  Move forward keeping all of this in mind, hiding none of it.\n\nGood luck", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut more NAH. The parents are just in shock. They prob never would have reacted well but they prob would have done better when you were thinking about it vs once it was done.", "NTA. They massively overstepped. I would suggest gently pointing out - *once* - that you and your kids love your wife and are not forgetting or replacing her. Regardless of where this dating goes, your wife will always be their mother. Just because you can't replace or restore the connection you lost doesn't mean you can't form new and different connections. But if they want to remain closely involved with the kids, they need to accept that and not try to get the kids worked up about what is (for now) your private adult life.", "NTA.  You get to decide when the right time is for you to start dating.  My FIL remarried reasonably quickly after his wife's death (I love my husband's stepmother, she's great).  My mom remarried my father, two years after her husband's death, having been pushed out to start dating by her in-laws.  \n\n\nYou don't need to ask them for permission, but be as open and honest with them and your kids as you feel comfortable with.", "NTA you're right here!\n\n3 years is completely appropriate. (Not that I have to tell anyone when it's appropriate, but I'm a strict believer of the 'grief year'. It takes some time to grief and get adjusted to a new situation)\n\nGood luck for the future. I think and hope your in-laws come to their senses. I can imagine their reaction was just due to being thrown into cold water with that info. After all, it was their daughter and after all, if you get serious with someone, they could become a step-parent to your children. I hope they come around.", "I love this answer.", "seconding this!! you just need to reassure them that they will always be part of the family regardless of your relationship status", "NTA. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. You are the only one who gets to decide when you\u2019re ready to start dating again. There is nothing bizarre or inherently unreasonable about starting to date 3 years after you lost your wife. And you certainly don\u2019t need your IL\u2019s permission! You don\u2019t even owe them a heads up, although if the relation ship were better, it would have been a nice gesture. I completely understand why they\u2019d find this upsetting on a number of levels, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing anything wrong or that they\u2019re entitled to criticize you.", "NTA. They don\u2019t get a vote: not on your dating, not on how you raise the children. It\u2019s past time they went back to whence they crawled.", "NTA", "NTA.  I do have concerns that your in-laws have so enmeshed themselves that they will now not respect boundaries and could even seek legal visitations (grandparents rights)if they feel you are moving on and they no longer have the access they do now.", "NTA. I imagine their grief is terrible, but they have no right to manipulate your life in any way", "Before this causes an unfixable break, collect your own motions and maybe do some reading about situations like this.  \n\nThey have been so forceful because they knew you would eventually want to date.  They aren\u2019t handling this well but they were taken by surprise.  \n\nTry talking to them and offer them assurances that you want a good and continuing relationship with them; that you want them to be an important part of their grandchildren\u2019s lives.  Since you all want your wife\u2019s legacy to continue, you hope the inevitable return to dating for you will not be a deal breaker for them.  \n\nPerhaps you can arrive at a weekend away for them, you, and the kids to work on and work out a readjustment.", "If you have read Reddits about blended families struggling with a step parent insisting on replacing a deceased parent with the kids or struggles over blending children from each adult relationship, you may want that in the back of your mind going forward.", "Holy boundaries, Batman. \nThey are seeing their grandchildren, and often. Your dating life does not belong to them. \nI'm sorry you have that reason for dating again, but I hope you can enjoy yourself!", "NTA. But they're probably still grieving and feeling sorry for their daughter. Don't take it personally. Just do your thing. It's your life. You deserve to be happy, too.", "NTA\nFirst they encourage you to date then totally freak out when you do. Three years is a totally respectable amount of time to wait before dating again and you are wise to wait to introduce any new woman to your kids until you feel the time is right and the relationship has progressed well enough. \n\nPlease be honest with the women you date about being a father though. And be sure your kids are comfortable with your choice and that it\u2019s a good fit for all of you before making anything permanent.\n\nBe prepared for your former IL\u2019s to try and manipulate your kids into acting out against you and any woman you bring in. \n\nIt\u2019s too soon for them, it will ALWAYS be too soon for them. If they had their way you would never date or get married again. \n\nI\u2019m sure part of their issue is a fear that if you do date/remarry you will not allow them to continue seeing the kids.\nBut you can\u2019t live your life in their fear.", "I think when they lost their daughter, your in-laws upgraded you into a son to make sure they stayed connected to their grandchildren.  You dating reminded them how you became part of the family and made them think they could lose you and the kids.  As long as you reassure them that they will always be part of the kids' lives, they should be OK.  This would be an excellent time to start shifting the kids' interactions with them over to their place whenever possible.  Any SO is not going to be comfortable with them underfoot constantly.", "NTA. 3 years is more than a respectable amount of time for any young widow/er to wait before dating again. I assure you your children are old enough to understand the situation and will not be confused. \n\nI would encourage you to set stronger boundaries with them and make it very clear that while you love them, appreciate their dedication to your children, and want them to maintain a close relationship, you will not tolerate them interfering in your personal life. The last thing you need is your in-laws creating issues between your kids and a partner you're serious about.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. You do not have to tell them or ask permission to date. You deserve to find happiness again. Don\u2019t let their words or actions stop you from moving on in a healthy happy way.", "*MIL got very upset and told me that I should have asked for their permission before I started dating again.*\n\nOh, no. It doesn't work like that. Keep your kids' grandparents in their lives, but firmly set and make them understand your boundaries. NTA.", "NTA, your in-laws are still grieving but you deserve to move on. You are still young and don\u2019t deserve to be alone.", "YNA but they were probably more shocked since they can\u2019t move on. Please don\u2019t introduce your kids to anyone you are dating unless you are thinking marriage. They need to focus on growing up and not dads love life. I hope it works out with this woman!!", "This is really thoughtful and insightful. Great response.", "I think its more the mother could probably have used a heads up.\n\nHer daughters husband is moving on, which is fine but it is the final death knell for her daughter.", "I agree with you OP needs no permission, but I'd  consider restricting the grandparents' access to the kids the very last resort if they prove to be completely unreasonable. Otherwise, I'd bear in mind these people were helping when you needed it most, and there is likely a strong and unique bond between them and your kids. Don't break this unless absolutely necessary, because this is an immensely valuable bond.", ">If they keep up this nonsense, restrict their access to the kids.\n\nYou know ... I wouldn't do it in retaliation. I'd want to keep the issue of how often they see the kids separate from your dating life. But I think it's reasonable if OP wanted to tighten up those boundaries with the GPs. I'd say maybe just 1 weeknight dinner and one weekend day, not including ballgames and concerts and birthdays.\n\nThe kids are getting older. They're  going to be busier with more friends, activities and homework. The GPs don't have to be here everyday, even if they call ahead. It's reasonable to start building more space (for everyone) before the teen years hit.\n\nAnd this should not take multiple conversations, either. Tell them how it is and be firm about turning down extra visits.\n\nJust something to think about.\n\nAs for the dating - - yeah, you don't need to tell your inlaws anything you don't want to tell them, for any reason. Obviously NTA.", "Thirding, and my heart goes out to all of you, NAH really here.\n\nThey have no right to dictate how you should (not) date, nor you are obliged to ask their permission.\n\nHowever, given that they have been genuinely there for you and your kids and they made significant sacrifices for that, such as moving, they in my opinion deserve some assurance they will not be canceled from your lives should you find another companion. And the risk is real. I know a case very similar to yours - a mother of two died, her family was helping really on all fronts, but then the widower almost cut contact with them, depriving them of their grandchildren, and they are very unhappy and just cannot wrap their heads around why he did it.\n\nSo please date as you please, and do not ask your inlaws permission, but be gentle towards them and assure them they will always be welcome in your life and that of your kids. \n\nI also noticed you would probably appreciate if they came to visit with less frequency to give you some space to breathe. I fully understand you but given the situation, this is going to be a tricky one. As you said they live pretty close, do you think it would be an option to have the kids visit them rather than them coming to your house? In that way they would have more frequent contact with the kids (which I think, without any offense, is for them more important than to have contact with you) while leaving you some space?\n\nAnyway, I wish you all luck, I think all of you are good people and I hope you will figure it out.", "What about the person you are trying to date?", "I mean he can still ask but don't think she's gonna respond", "I agree with your last statement. The wife's death is heartbreaking for the parents, but OP and the kids are dealing with the same thing. However, it seems OP has already been trying to distance himself because of their overbearing and intrusive behavior. \n\nHe has every right to move on and not have to feel like his deceased wife's parents are such a huge part of his life. The fact that the parents say three years is too soon to move on shows that OP was absolutely right not to tell them since he already knew what the reaction would be.  \n\nSince when do grandparents deserve a heads up about someone's personal life? They deserve to see their grandkids, but they do not get to dictate anything just because their daughter died.", "It\u2019s less about retaliation and more about making it abundantly clear that not only is it an issue that\u2019s closed for discussion, but that any future attempts to discuss it with OP or the children will result in them losing grandparent privileges. I don\u2019t trust this pair to not try to drive a wedge into OP\u2019s relationship with his kids by telling them that their dad is breaking their mom\u2019s heart in heaven (or some such nonsense like that). MIL especially seems to be completely divorced from reality.", "I mean i'm not saying the grandparents are right in that its too soon.\n\nBut as they have been so involved, them knowing that he is moving on and dating again i personally think would be nice for him to let them know."]}
