Their grief is real but definitely not an excuse to exhibit such controlling behaviours about your personal life and how you choose to move on. Three years is a pretty long time to wait before starting to date. \n\nI\u2019d strongly suggest putting up very strong boundaries and limiting contact between you and the in laws, nothing drastic but maybe just a weekly thing at a base level\u2026 only suggesting as you don\u2019t want them to start projecting these views on to your kids.", "NTA - You waited until YOU were right to date. This is good. You haven't rushed into your dates meeting the children. This is good.\n\nI have no idea what was actually said, but you seem to understand why they might be hurt. This is good. Now they need to see why their action are not Good.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you started dating 3 days, 3 week or 3 months after your wife died. It's 3 years.

You didn\u2019t. Your kids didn\u2019t. You still get to have a life and the opportunity to model a healthy adult relationship for your kids. Your in laws don\u2019t get to decide when you\u2019re ready to date and they don\u2019t get to impose their rules or beliefs on you. You were married to their daughter, not to them. Do be careful of them trying to sabotage your relationships with your kids and your future partner though.", "NTA and tell your in laws to mind their boundaries. You most definitely do not need their approval or permission to date again and what you do with your life is not something they can control. You do not need to wait an entire lifetime to grieve and sometimes you just need to move on. It appears that the in laws just want to take over and run the family and it might be worth pushing back a lot more on the boundaries.", "NTA \n\nGo and live your life", "NTA. They are way overstepping, and waiting three years before slowly working your way back into dating is not rushing at all. Definitely time to set some strong boundaries and enforce them. Be sure to warn anyone you are getting serious with about your inlaws.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour in Laws are probably just so gutted by the loss of their daughter. Your kids are probably in a sense keeping her alive for them, so it's natural they're going to get a little over the top about your kids.\n\nThat being said you're allowed to date, and if they want to have a cordial relationship with you and your kids, they need to accept that you're a human being too. \n\nYou dating is just another reminder that she is gone forever. It obviously is upsetting for them, but they can't blow up at you when they get upset. \n\nIs their house decently sized? Rather than having them constantly stop by your house could you bring your kids over to them a few days a week? Then you get your space and they still get to see the kids. It's chaotic having someone that isn't your direct family constantly in your space and it sounds like you are due for some time to yourself.\n\nBest of luck OP!", "NTA - you probably should have just ripped the band aid off and told them outright. Now that it is out, this is a very touchy subject for all. Them because it's the loss of their daughter and you for the loss of your wife. All of you are going to have to find a common ground from which to build your relationships going forward, because like it or not, they are in your life and will be until they die.\n\nYou might want to consider therapy for yourself if you aren't already doing so. Doing a family therapy with your in-laws could be very beneficial too in that an impartial therapist can structure the conversations in a way where all of you hear each other, because right now none of you are listening to the other.\n\nAnyway, it's your life and three years is plenty of time for a grieving period where you don't consider dating. At some point you should sit with your kids and ask them how they feel about you dating and so on to test the waters now so that you can have a plan of action should they not be happy with the news.  Good luck.", "I'm sorry for your loss, OP.\n\nNTA.

Nearly 3 years is not \"too soon\" by any standard.  But that's not something you can convince them of--so don't even try.\n\nBased on the fact that they moved so close to you, I'm going to assume they don't have other grandchildren, and possibly your wife was their only child.  Your in-laws look at your children as \"their family\" more so than \"your kids.\"  In their mind, you dating is the first step down the slippery slope of them being boxed out of ~~your kid's~~ their grandchildren's lives by the \"wicked step-mother.\"\n\nFor them, \"never\" is too soon.

I would understand them being pissed if you started dating after a couple months but it's not that unreasonable to date after a few years.", "NTA - And sorry for your loss. \n\nYour former in-laws are obviously still grieving, but they are completely overstepping boundaries here, big time. \n\nIt may be time to put some more space between you by not allowing them to come over as much and you being clear on new boundaries they must respect. If they choose not to respect them, you can go no-contact.", "NTA. Their grief is immense and I think they were kind of using the kids as shield to not feel it completely. You dating is just another reminder that she is gone and life is still moving forward.

You don't, at all, and they're lucky you continue to allow them into your live at all considering how overbearing they've been. They need to back off.", "NTA.  There are so many ways you could have approached this and probably some of them would have resulted in a better outcome.  However, your choice is your choice and you do not have to feel guilty about it.  3 years is absolutely not too soon and you shouldn't feel like you need to tiptoe around their feelings.  You loved your wife.  If you can try to continue to talk to her parents about this that might be what is best for your family.  Perhaps you can start with a letter outlining all of your feelings.  I would do this sooner rather than later because you probably will want to know if they are ever going to be able to come around long before you enter into any sort of serious relationship with someone.  I think a counselor would probably do wonders with helping your family through this, because your children will need you to be on top of your game and they, not your former in-laws, need to come first.", "Strong NTA\n\nOnly you know when you're ready to start dating again.

You could have started dating the day after your wife passed if that\u2019s what you wanted. It\u2019s not their business to be stepping up in. 3 years is a very respectable time frame. I know they lost their daughter but losing a spouse is much worse. That\u2019s literally the person you depended on for everything. That was your partner. That was the mother to your children. She was your everything. They don\u2019t don\u2019t get to decide your grieving process. If you feel they are corrupting your kiddos and saying things they shouldn\u2019t hear (daddy is trying to replace your mommy; you don\u2019t want a new mommy; etc) then clear boundaries (like no unsupervised visitation or no contact) needs to be strongly considered.

Uncharted territory and keeping to yourself on this is totally understandable.\n\nI get what you are saying about these boundaries with your in-laws, as they were there for you and kids when you needed them after your wife passed.   But it's been a few years now, and they need to understand you don't need them near as much as before.   Nor do you need their permission to start dating - wow!   I think that was just a weird comment for them to make, but perhaps a \"knee-jerk\" reaction, possibly never considering that you will eventually move on with your life.   They just probably need time to process, and should never have said this.   They were wrong.\n\nYou are doing all things great - for yourself and your children.   Inlaws need to back off,  & you set those new boundaries.", "NTA for sure.  Man that sounds like an insufferable situation.  I understand how the help is needed though and you certainly don't want to cut them off from their grandkids so all that makes sense.  But their attitude is completely inappropriate and way over entitled.", "Absolutely NTA. But you should have talked to your in-laws. They should have heard about this in a different way. I think it would have been polite for you to tell them you were dating. You definitely didn\u2019t need their permission or approval or concerns about how it would affect the kids. I wouldn\u2019t say you need to apologize though. Even if it would have been polite, you weren\u2019t obligated to tell them you were dating.", "NTA. 3 years is a long time.

Do your in-laws expect you to stay single forever?  I believe that being willing to date again and hopefully have a relationship after your wife\u2019s death is a compliment to her. You were obviously happy in your marriage/ relationship with your wife that you are willing to be with someone else.", "I mean, I think you should ask your spouse for permission probably lol", "Yeah, I can understand their grief is immense and I think they were kind of using the kids as shield to not feel it completely, but they need to accept she is gone and life goes on.", "excellent point, i stand corrected.", "This was the best answer!"]}
