Their grief is real but definitely not an excuse to exhibit such controlling behaviours about your personal life and how you choose to move on. Three years is a pretty long time to wait before starting to date. \n\nI\u2019d strongly suggest putting up very strong boundaries and limiting contact between you and the in laws, nothing drastic but maybe just a weekly thing at a base level\u2026 only suggesting as you don\u2019t want them to start projecting these views on to your kids.", "NTA - You waited until YOU were right to date. This is good. You haven't rushed into your dates meeting the children. This is good.\n\nI have no idea what was actually said, but you seem to understand why they might be hurt. This is good. Now they need to see why their action are not Good.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you started dating 3 days, 3 week or 3 months after your wife died. It's 3 years.

You didn\u2019t. Your kids didn\u2019t. You still get to have a life and the opportunity to model a healthy adult relationship for your kids. Your in laws don\u2019t get to decide when you\u2019re ready to date and they don\u2019t get to impose their rules or beliefs on you. You were married to their daughter, not to them. Do be careful of them trying to sabotage your relationships with your kids and your future partner though.", "NTA and tell your in laws to mind their boundaries. You most definitely do not need their approval or permission to date again and what you do with your life is not something they can control. You do not need to wait an entire lifetime to grieve and sometimes you just need to move on. It appears that the in laws just want to take over and run the family and it might be worth pushing back a lot more on the boundaries.", "NTA \n\nGo and live your life", "NTA. They are way overstepping, and waiting three years before slowly working your way back into dating is not rushing at all. Definitely time to set some strong boundaries and enforce them. Be sure to warn anyone you are getting serious with about your inlaws.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour in Laws are probably just so gutted by the loss of their daughter. Your kids are probably in a sense keeping her alive for them, so it's natural they're going to get a little over the top about your kids.\n\nThat being said you're allowed to date, and if they want to have a cordial relationship with you and your kids, they need to accept that you're a human being too. \n\nYou dating is just another reminder that she is gone forever. It obviously is upsetting for them, but they can't blow up at you when they get upset. \n\nIs their house decently sized? Rather than having them constantly stop by your house could you bring your kids over to them a few days a week? Then you get your space and they still get to see the kids. It's chaotic having someone that isn't your direct family constantly in your space and it sounds like you are due for some time to yourself.\n\nBest of luck OP!", "NTA - you probably should have just ripped the band aid off and told them outright. Now that it is out, this is a very touchy subject for all. Them because it's the loss of their daughter and you for the loss of your wife. All of you are going to have to find a common ground from which to build your relationships going forward, because like it or not, they are in your life and will be until they die.\n\nYou might want to consider therapy for yourself if you aren't already doing so. Doing a family therapy with your in-laws could be very beneficial too in that an impartial therapist can structure the conversations in a way where all of you hear each other, because right now none of you are listening to the other.\n\nAnyway, it's your life and three years is plenty of time for a grieving period where you don't consider dating. At some point you should sit with your kids and ask them how they feel about you dating and so on to test the waters now so that you can have a plan of action should they not be happy with the news.  Good luck.", "I'm sorry for your loss, OP.\n\nNTA.

Nearly 3 years is not \"too soon\" by any standard.  But that's not something you can convince them of--so don't even try.\n\nBased on the fact that they moved so close to you, I'm going to assume they don't have other grandchildren, and possibly your wife was their only child.  Your in-laws look at your children as \"their family\" more so than \"your kids.\"  In their mind, you dating is the first step down the slippery slope of them being boxed out of ~~your kid's~~ their grandchildren's lives by the \"wicked step-mother.\"\n\nFor them, \"never\" is too soon.

If they choose not to respect them, you can go no-contact.", "NTA. Their grief is immense and I think they were kind of using the kids as shield to not feel it completely.

You don't, at all, and they're lucky you continue to allow them into your live at all considering how overbearing they've been. They need to back off.", "NTA.  There are so many ways you could have approached this and probably some of them would have resulted in a better outcome.  However, your choice is your choice and you do not have to feel guilty about it.  3 years is absolutely not too soon and you shouldn't feel like you need to tiptoe around their feelings.  You loved your wife.  If you can try to continue to talk to her parents about this that might be what is best for your family.  Perhaps you can start with a letter outlining all of your feelings.  I would do this sooner rather than later because you probably will want to know if they are ever going to be able to come around long before you enter into any sort of serious relationship with someone.  I think a counselor would probably do wonders with helping your family through this, because your children will need you to be on top of your game and they, not your former in-laws, need to come first.", "Strong NTA\n\nOnly you know when you're ready to start dating again.

You could have started dating the day after your wife passed if that\u2019s what you wanted. It\u2019s not their business to be stepping up in. 3 years is a very respectable time frame. I know they lost their daughter but losing a spouse is much worse. That\u2019s literally the person you depended on for everything. That was your partner. That was the mother to your children.

Uncharted territory and keeping to yourself on this is totally understandable.\n\nI get what you are saying about these boundaries with your in-laws, as they were there for you and kids when you needed them after your wife passed.   But it's been a few years now, and they need to understand you don't need them near as much as before.   Nor do you need their permission to start dating - wow!   I think that was just a weird comment for them to make, but perhaps a \"knee-jerk\" reaction, possibly never considering that you will eventually move on with your life.

Inlaws need to back off,  & you set those new boundaries.", "NTA for sure.  Man that sounds like an insufferable situation.

But their attitude is completely inappropriate and way over entitled.", "Absolutely NTA. But you should have talked to your in-laws. They should have heard about this in a different way. I think it would have been polite for you to tell them you were dating. You definitely didn\u2019t need their permission or approval or concerns about how it would affect the kids.

Do your in-laws expect you to stay single forever?  I believe that being willing to date again and hopefully have a relationship after your wife\u2019s death is a compliment to her. You were obviously happy in your marriage/ relationship with your wife that you are willing to be with someone else.", "I mean, I think you should ask your spouse for permission probably lol", "Yeah, I can understand their grief is immense and I think they were kind of using the kids as shield to not feel it completely, but they need to accept she is gone and life goes on.", "excellent point, i stand corrected.", "This was the best answer!", "NTA to be honest - there\u2019s absolutely no reason that your in-laws \u201cneed\u201d to know about your dating life before your kids. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they let it slip to see how the kids react to try and guilt trip you", "NTA\n\nYou wanted to wait until it was worth bringing up. I get that they are hurt and that it probably was a gut punch of a realization that their daughter really is gone forever, along with fear that someone a new woman will become their grandkids \u201cnew mom\u201d. Regardless of their feelings, their reaction was inappropriate and unfair to you.", "First off, I am so sorry to you and your kiddos, and all impacted for your loss. \n\nYou are their parent and always have been, and you make the final decisions on your lives at this point. I know their daughter is gone but that does not mean they become their mom in her place. \n\nI think they are afraid if you date they are going to somehow lose their grandkids, but from what I've read that is not the thing. Perhaps telling them that space does not equal losing their grandchildren. \n\nAnyway, NTA and obviously you owe them nothing about your dating life. You seem like you are doing about it the right way and I suspect your wife would want you to be happy in this terrible situation. Good luck.", "I think they're afraid that if you remarry, they'll lose their grandchildren because then you'll want to spend holidays and stuff with your new in-laws. But you still have the right to move on with your life. Three years is not too soon. It could be ten years and they'd still be unhappy about it.

They are holding on to you to keep that pain from getting too deep. \n\nMake it clear that you will always love their daughter, and nothing will change that. Maybe establish a special weekend, once a month, just for you and your kids to spend time with them. Visit your wife's grave with them occasionally. At the same time, keep very specific boundaries. They cannot come over every day, or whenever they like. Explain to them that the more they try to be possessive of your love and attention, the more they will push you away. \n\nGood luck!", "Nta!", "Ridiculous inlaws have no say over your life.   Why are you asking?", "NTA. You don't need their permission to date. You need to set boundaries and make it clear that dropping by is no longer an option.

None of their business. I get that they are probably still grieving your late wife but that does not give them the veto on how you are living your life years after her passing.  From the way you describe their regular presence in your home you have been more than accommodating to them, and giving them plenty of access to the grand kids. It may be time to start separating them a little from your day to day life.  Good luck.", "NTA, tell them specifically what you told us, \u201cI wanted to see how I felt about it before I brought them into it.\u201d Tell them you plan on keeping them in your family\u2019s life and see them as family, but you can\u2019t be alone forever.

That\u2019s not possible. \n\nThey will never, ever stop grieving their baby died. It just doesn\u2019t work like that. And they\u2019re going to grieve horribly as you date, and if you marry again, even if it\u2019s 20 years later. And that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s normal. What\u2019s not ok is to put that on you.\n\nI would strongly push your MIL towards grief therapy.

I would suggest gently pointing out - *once* - that you and your kids love your wife and are not forgetting or replacing her. Regardless of where this dating goes, your wife will always be their mother. Just because you can't replace or restore the connection you lost doesn't mean you can't form new and different connections.

I know a case very similar to yours - a mother of two died, her family was helping really on all fronts, but then the widower almost cut contact with them, depriving them of their grandchildren, and they are very unhappy and just cannot wrap their heads around why he did it.\n\nSo please date as you please, and do not ask your inlaws permission, but be gentle towards them and assure them they will always be welcome in your life and that of your kids. \n\nI also noticed you would probably appreciate if they came to visit with less frequency to give you some space to breathe. I fully understand you but given the situation, this is going to be a tricky one. As you said they live pretty close, do you think it would be an option to have the kids visit them rather than them coming to your house?

He was a wonderful dad and did everything to take care of us - he deserves all the joy in the world.\n\nThat said - you've got grieving children on your hands that lost their mother suddenly & unexpectedly - grieving isn't always linear, *especially* for young kids - are they in therapy, and have you sat down & talked to them about this? If you can maybe get the sitter to watch 2/3 and do like \"1-on-1 Dad Dates\" over a long weekend or something, you can do an activity together or go out to lunch or something and talk to them. Gauge their feelings, and make sure they know that your desire for companionship doesn't do *anything* to diminish your love for their mother, and that you're not trying to replace her - the 2nd part is especially important. There's countless posts here daily where stepparents try to basically shoehorn the parent title for themselves, and while we're getting ahead of ourselves here, this is so important. Make sure the kiddos feel seen, heard, and understand that you will always love mom, and them. \n\nLastly - as a side note - be *very* careful with the inlaws - they're clearly both TA here,  but more importantly, they may try to get your children \"on their side\" by feeding them BS - talk to the kids ASAP.\n\nNTA & best of luck, OP. \ud83d\udc9c If I can be of any help, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message - we're close in age and I've been on your kids side of this tragic situation, and if I can be of any help I'm more than happy to.", "NTA-3 years is not too soon.
