If money in the family is not a problem, she should have told her husband she needed more.", "I think you may need to ask for clarification here. Im a STAH and my husband not only brings the bacon but he also does the budget. Despite me having all access to OUR money i still word things for the sake of explaining a story with \"he gave me\" sometimes. Especially if the money was handed to me in cash to use over swiping a card. Because he quite literally gave me the money. I wouldn't jump to conclusions and instantly assume financial abuse.", "At the very least it\u2019s ESH.  There\u2019s no reason the mom should have stolen money from her son.", "no one is so petty. It seems weird", "OP deleted their profile because they got caught making things up, but the financially abusive comments were when they expanded the story to the wife getting $300/mo for groceries for three people *and* having the receipts scrutinized every time, despite the family being well off. That is a ridiculous level of financial control to exert on a spouse, even a non-working one.", "Setting aside my doubts that this is a true story, It's just very odd for a \"wealthy\" family to have a situation where one spouse is driven to stealing cash from their kid. In a rich family, a couple of hundred dollars should be a relatively trivial sum that certainly isn't worth stealing. It's obvious OP is, at the very least, extremely controlling with money. But with only the context provided, it either isn't a credible story or OP seems to have left out some very important details about why the wife in a wealthy family's household would be tempted by their kid's piggy bank.\n\nDoesn't guarantee OP is an ass. Mom could have a gambling problem or whatever, but the story is incomplete and the natural question is \"why didn't OP complete the story/are they leaving out details that would be damaging to their side of the story?\"", "He gives her $300 a month for groceries and $100 a month for her \"fun\" money and expects receipts for everything. He's financially abusive and while mom still sucks for stealing from her own child, the roots of this family is rotten aka the OP.", "OP was also a woman?", "Ooh, this needs to go up.", "Considering she stole money from her kids savings jar I\u2019d say she probably can\u2019t be trusted with money but it\u2019s too limited context to make a good assumption regardless", "1 and a half actually\n\nMy son can actually work for some money without complaining and he can even take care of himself when he's home alone", "Maybe Someone who needed to pay for groceries to get them by the week.  because breadwinner keeps the family on a tight leash\n\nSchool season coming up. Kid probably needed some school clothes.  Maybe wife thought she could slip the money back from next months household allowance and kick the shortages down the road", "Someone whose spouse won't give them a debit card and only gives them $300 a month for groceries. The wife shouldn't steal from their kid, but OP is incredibly financially abusive, to the point that the wife won't even ask for money she truly needs.", "They\u2019re so well off that the son has to work and save for a PS5 at 11years old and the wife gets an \u201callowance\u201d of a 100 bucks a month. And 300 in groceries a month for a family of 3. (And she has to give her the receipts for everything she buys.)", "The fact that the wife has to give her the receipts for everything she spends I would say \u201cnope\u201d.", "I'm sure OP has thought of that. Probably has a scheme in place to keep control of the money.", "I hope she succeeds. How desperate was the wife to do something as disgusting as stealing from her own son.", "I control all finances, normally I give her $300 every paycheck (I get payed once a month, I have a high income job) so she can buy groceries for the month.", "This is some REACHING imo. If the wife needed extra money, she could have asked OP, there is absolutely no reasonable excuse for her to steal money from a child.\n\nNTA.", "If she's willing to steal from her young child clearly she can't be trusted with money. Simple as that.", "The problem started way before that. Why the hell does she need to steal money when the fmily has money in the bank?", "if you think a 40-year-old woman stealing money from her 11-year-old son for literally no reason whatsoever is realistic i don't know what to tell you", "My family of three spends a whole lot more than $300/month on food. Like, yeah, it's doable if you had to but for a well-off family in 2023 in the US? That's an incredibly restrictive budget.", "Yeah, this is starting to ring untrue at this point.\n\nGetting paid once a month isn't unheard of, but pay periods are almost always twice a month even for exempt employees, and non-exempt employees get paid once every two weeks. And $300 for groceries for three people for a month isn't impossible, but for somebody who is very well off that's incredibly frugal and your wife would almost certainly be complaining about it. It's also bizarrely controlling to scrutinize an already extremely frugal grocery bill on a fixed allowance, to the point if this was real it'd be a strong sign you're financially abusive.\n\nCombining that with how you don't seem to have a model for relationships beyond parenting, and this is reading like a teenager making up stories.", "This sounds really financially abusive.", "Omg! Are you for real? It doesn\u2019t excuse what she did to her son but you are a financially abusive TA.", "op is female according to the post", "Oops. Well she\u2019s still a financial abuser.", "If you really feel this way, just... get a divorce. Like, I'm not saying you're wrong for being frustrated or anything, but you're writing like you basically adopted your wife by marrying her and you're comparing her executive capacity *unfavorably* to an 11 year old, and you cannot possibly solve this fundamental problem by more aggressively parenting your wife.", "PFFT. THIS RESPONSE OP! you did the right thing \nI don\u2019t work, my bf makes all the money, and I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t take any money that wasn\u2019t mine after he gives me money for what we need, did she by any chance pop up with anything new recently ? Any new expensive clothes? Anything like that?", "Shit, that really changes things. I hope she keeps her job and gives herself some freedom.", "I would agree, but I want to hear it from OP.", "Probably involves a weapon. \n\nA lot of years ago there was a criminal mind episode about battered woman syndrome, if this real it reminds me strongly of that episode.", "That only answered one of my questions. Does she have money she can do with as she pleases?", "I don't live int the US but I spend more than 100 euros every 3 weeks and I live alone. How is 300 dollars enough to feed three people for a month ?", "Where do you live that you can feed a family of at least three people with 300 dollars per month?", "Theres a chance she wants the money for something she doesn't want the husband to know about.  Could be a good thing, could be a bad thing.  Either way, stealing that much money from an 11 year old is scumbaggery of the highest degree.", "I may be missing some context or nuance here but it\u2019s hard for to excuse stealing from a child when it sounds like she has support from people calling him a AH", "So you say eg no mother kill their children??? I don't know anything u actually saw the trial of women who allegedly killed her child because she was thinking having a baby is no fun it's a real story!!! \n\nAlso I saw what people do to get money for drugs...(stealing from any and everyone)\n\nSo ye I can imagine any mother stealing money from a kid...", "I am guessing this isn't a hcol place, three hundred dollars for three people in food sounds like a steal. I couldn't feed myself on that amount.....well, I could, but I wouldn't like it.", "Twice a month isn't a universal standard. That seems to be a North American thing. It's usually monthly for salaries, (or weekly for wages).", "Fidelity investments pays everyone who works for them once a month and they\u2019ve been that way for decades", "Amazon corporate pays once a month in some locations in the US. But usually you'd need to be to distinguish between \"paid\" and \"payed\" to work there, so like you I suspect this was baloney.", "I live in France and most people get paid monthly.\n\nThat being said, he's speaking in dollars so...", "Unheard of? Every job I was paid once a month.", "No she hasn't, she just took the money without asking either of us", "Hoping with you. It\u2019s why I asked the questions I did because it sounded dodgy. A mom would have to be either evil to the core or desperate to steal from her own child.", "OP ran away.", "Around $100 each check", "US. Family of 3 plus 2 dogs. Dogs average about $150-200 a month in food, treats and supplements (hip, joint, skin). Groceries about $300-400. I go shopping every week.", "Indeed.", "That's like getting upset at someone for stealing food and forgetting to ask why they are hungry. There's something off when a wife has to beg a husband for money.", "FYI OP is a woman", "OP comes across like a controlling and abusive husband. I wouldn't be surprised if the wife really did need the money like she said. Everything about the dynamic sounds off to me and full of red flags.", "OP deleted their account, they were definitely lying lol. But nowhere in the US is low enough COL to spend that little on groceries, unless their tall tale was that they were converting from another currency or something.", "I assume if somebody is writing in dollars and it isn't in the middle of the night in the US, they're American, but you are correct that's somewhat of a USA-centric assumption.", "As I said, it isn't unheard of, but it's atypical for the US; it's under 10% of the working population. That, combined with the ridiculously low grocery allowance (and now OP deleting their account) is what makes it ring untrue. It's how the pieces fit together, not the individual pieces.", "Yeah, in the US monthly pay is something like 10% of employees, and maybe that's like 20-25% of salaried exempt employees. Not unheard of, but the least likely option and the one that makes the allowance they made up pretty ridiculous.", "Yes. Though some people will convert to dollars in posts even if they don't live in the US, especially if they do not wish to say where they live.", "I said \"isn't\" unheard of. Monthly is the legal minimum for exempt workers, but it's much rarer than bimonthly, and for any non-exempt workers the legal minimum is bi-weekly, making it the most common pay period in the US.\n\nMy point is that OP saying that they have a high paying job and get paid monthly isn't *impossible*, but it's an improbability that adds together with the other improbabilities in their story.", "But what did she do with it?...", "So what did she actually spend the money on? I feel like something is off here?", "Already? Reddit is scary ig. Boo! Lol", "A 100 bucks a month? And you have a high paying job? If that\u2019s all you \u201callow\u201d her then either you don\u2019t have as high a paying job as you think, or you\u2019re just cheap.", "Maybe he is controlling and abusive. But I just can\u2019t justify her stealing from a child when it sounds like she has people on her side. If they are willing to call him a AH I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be a resource prior to stealing from your own child", "Truly.", "Didn\u2019t know it was that rare in the US. Here it\u2019s pretty much standard unless you\u2019re a \u201cblue collar\u201d.", "Yup, about 70 comments ago. Once people started focusing on her financial abuse she ran.", "I asked her when I first got this job if she needed any more a month and she said no, she never asked me if she could have more a month, if she asked for more I very likely would have said yes", "She can make her own fucking money, Husbands are equal partners, not Fathers with a responsibility to take care of their coddled wives", "Every white collar job i had or known someone was every other week\n\nSome jobs higher than me were monthly but i didnt know them personally", "It's under 10% of workers in the United States.", "Question is : Why does she have to ask ? \n\nMy father worked. My mother did the grocery shopping. She never had to ask for the money. She had her own card and could buy what she wanted whenever she wanted. \n\nHas your wife had issues with money before ?", "Why does she not have a card and access to the bank account? \nESH. She stole from her son but you are a controlling  and raging a h.", "OP is also a woman.", "The answer is most likely that this person is lying and their only understanding of relationships are from their parents and Reddit/AITA's *very* atypical standard of married couples having completely segregated finances.", "yeah, if (big IF) this is true, it's the 11M making up answers.", "I am suspecting it's a kid, since they think you can feed a family of  3 on $70/week and $100/month is a generous allowance."]}
