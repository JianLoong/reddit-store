So I invited my boyfriend(21m) to come with me as a plus one. My brother and sister in law only gave invitation out to immediate family and to a few of their friends. When my best friend(21f) let\u2019s call her Sally, found out she was mad at me for not thinking of her since she\u2019s never been to a wedding. Sally was even more angry when our other best friend(22f) lets call her Kate, we are a trio, got invited to the wedding. Kate is dating my cousin that\u2019s why she was invited. Kate is my cousin plus one. Kate and my boyfriend has already met my family and sister in law family. They are even close friends with my cousins and some of my sister in law cousins so it was no problem to my brother and sister in law. Sally however has never met anyone in my family due to her always saying she\u2019s busy. Sally, Kate and I three always invite each other to every family event we have. Kate and I always go to each family event any of us are invited too. Sally has never came to any of ours though but we always go to hers (I just noticed lmao.) My brother and sis in law know Sally exist but never formerly met. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t invite her. Why would you want to go to a wedding when you don\u2019t even know the bride or groom. I understand Sally\u2019s point of view, she probably feels left out but if I bring her as my plus one I would have to stay by her 24/7 since she doesn\u2019t know anybody and I\u2019ll feel bad if I leave her alone (I\u2019m a bridesmaid so I won\u2019t be able to stay by her side and I don\u2019t have to worry about my boyfriend being alone since he has close friends from both sides of the family.) Her family and friends are calling Kate and I AH and fake for not inviting her. I lowkey feel bad but I don\u2019t know what I should do. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Reading your guys comments and actually thinking about it made me realize how bad of friend she is. I should\u2019ve noticed soon but I didn\u2019t. I think I was trying to make the \u201ctrio\u201d work because people usually say trio\u2019s never work. I never thought the way she acted was entitled and thought it was just her personality. Seems like she is the AH in question. I\u2019m mad that I didn\u2019t notice sooner.", "created_utc": 1687003178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bpbu4/aita_for_not_inviting_my_best_friend_to_my/", "score": 384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend needs to get a grip and put the main character syndrome to rest.", "NTA. Sally hasn't respected your invitations to family events enough to actually show up and now she is expecting these same people to invite her to an intimate wedding with just immediate family members. And she wants you to invite her over your bf just because she hasn't been to a wedding before? That's not a justifiable reason. I also understand her feeling left out, but she should realise she hasn't made an effort to get to know your family like Kate has.\n\nYou could talk to her and explain your reasons and hope she understands, if not then let it be and see how she acts with invitations going forward, that's if you want to continue inviting her in the first place.", "NTA. Can we also talk about how weird it is she thinks she should take priority over OPs boyfriend????", "NTA\n\nSally is demanding you take her to your brother\u2019s wedding when she knows no one and you are a bridesmaid because she wants to go to any wedding. She frequently does not go to events you invite her to. Sally is a selfish person. Dragging other people in to the matter is ridiculous. Say no and maybe words like grow ip Sally. Take your boyfriend and ignore what Sally and her dumb family and friends say. They can invite Sally to their own weddings.", "Seriously?\n\nI\u2019m having difficulty wrapping my head around how absolutely ridiculous Sally\u2019s point of view is. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your friend is definitely being odd as inviting your current partner is normally what people do for weddings. Especially since your boyfriend already seems to know your family, it would be weird to NOT bring him in that case. Your friend needs to find a hobby, maybe being a wedding planner if she wants to go to one so bad.", "NTA\n\nIf Sally has a habit of cancelling everytime your family have tried to meet her why would they invite her?\n\nFirst of all she\u2019s never met your sister and second of all why would they pay for a spot for someone who probably won\u2019t show? \n\nTruthfully it sounds like Kate is a better friend and Sally needs to get over herself", "NTA.\n\n>she was mad at me for not thinking of her since she\u2019s never been to a wedding\n\nAmazing. She really thought you wouldn't invite your boyfriend because of this. The rest of your post makes her sound even sillier.", "NTA- that's some extra heavy duty entitlement on your \"friend\" Sally's part. She doesn't know the bride, groom, or any of their families, and she has the nerve to be mad she didn't get the plus one? To a wedding? Instead of bf(who DOES know everybody)? She is delusional and so is her family. It would be an insult to the actual couple to take her as you've said they only wanted immediate family and friends, and she is neither.", "Simply NTA \nI don\u2019t see how does this even make sense in her head. You can\u2019t invite random people to other people\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your party and therefor not up to you to invite people for it or not.", "NTA why does she want to go to a wedding for someone she doesn't know", "Nta.\nShe don't even know the groom or bride why she wants to go this wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course you\u2019ll invite your boyfriend not some random friend they don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure they expected the plus one to go to your boyfriend, that is fairly normal if you have one.
