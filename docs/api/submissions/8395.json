It's understandable that there was some tension after 4 months of you and your husband living with your parents, but they were there to support you when you needed it.\n\nRelationships take effort, and it's not hard to call home and talk for 10 minutes every week or so. It's even easier to respond to a text (which I'm sure you do with friends and other people all day long).\n\nYour behaviour right now is really signaling \"I got everything I need out of the relationship with you, now leave me alone to live my life.\" Is that what you intend?", "NTA it's only been 2 months, you are busy grown adults. Your dad has made no effort to contact and you are texting with your mom. I grew up with a mom that insisted on weekly calls and then rushed to hang up on them. It (and other things) bred resentment. I think it would be good to call them soon, but you aren't an a-h for not calling so far and still would NOT be even if you never called again.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are the AHs. **THEY CAN CALL if they want to talk to you.** But you are fine not to answer the phone every time they call. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you certainly do not need to answer your mom's texts every day. Sounds far to exhausting.", "YTA.   First of all, it's not unusual or unreasonable for them not to \"reach out\" to your husband, even if they liked him.  He's not their son. You're their daughter, and they obviously don't have a lot to chat about.    And you cared enough about your parents to use them for free rent, but not enough to call regularly?  How do you think that makes them feel?   I'll tell you.  Shitty.\n\nYour mom wants to call you and talk about her day?  How horrible that must be.  Seriously?!  My mother died 22 years ago and I would kill to have another conversation about our days.    If you have a busy schedule, then tell mom you'd like to set aside an hour or so every xxxxx at 6:00 to catch up on the week, and then stick to it.   Make her a priority in your life even when you don't need free housing.", "NTA  but remember this.... when they both pass away there will be no more texts or calls from them and you will wish you had the chance to talk to them again", "NTA sounds like they aren't seeing you as \"an adult\" and you are just tired.", "Well if YTA so am I on this. I feel you but we should probably both try and do better here.", "You could just put it on speaker and let her ramble for a bit while you wash dishes or something.\n\n\"Uh huh.  Uh huh.\"\n\nI hate calling too.\n\nYTA and so am I", "NTA. You're not obligated to remain in contact with your parents. If they wanted you to stay in touch with them then perhaps they should have treated you better. You and your husband work full time and still had difficulty finding somewhere to live, while your parents were probably able to afford a nice place on just a single income when they were your age.\n\nMore than two adults sharing a house is difficult at the best of times, when you're all in the same boat and view each other as equals. It's far worse when some parties view the relations as unequal, e.g. parents still treating their children like they're kids even though they're adults. No wonder you found those four months frustrating.\n\nIt sounds like your mom is now experiencing empty nest syndrome. Savor the schadenfreude. If you call your parents again, do it because *you* want to, not because *they* want you to. And if you don't want to call them, then don't call them.", "YTA. \n\nYour parents let you live with them. They were used to an empty house, and having you and your husband move into it was as hard on them as it was on you, maybe harder. \n\nYes, your mother is going to ramble about what is happening in her life or her job - and who are you to say what's stressful and isn't? - because that's her world, and she's trying to include you in it. \n\nShe also wants to hear about your world. \n\nWhen I was 30, I moved in with my parents for 2 months. It was hell on all of us. They had their routines, and everything I did upset those routines. I was the intruder, but they graciously let me live there for free. \n\nCall your mom. Set aside 30 min a week, and call her. Let her ramble about her job, and share details about your life. Let her know how your classes are going, how your husband is doing. You want her to respect him? Share how well he's doing and how hard he's working. It doesn't have to be deep, but just do it. \n\nIt's not unusual for them not to have reached out to your husband. I'm not sure why they would have.", "Yta.  Families can be tough and it wasn't great but they opened their home to you and your husband...not all parents will do that. Now that you are doing better (even though you'rebusy) you are blowing them off.  Not cool.", "Have the conversation with your mom that puts boundaries around contact (how often, who contacts who, method of contact).  Or just tell her that you will contact her every x days/weeks/months/years and then ignore her attempts.", "NTA, but if I were you, i\u2019d communicate with them that I need my space", "NTA, but some advice\u2026 Calling when you have a built-in excuse for ending the call is one suggestion. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a real reason. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for someone to get home/back to the car/call me back, etc.\u201d The other option is to pick the best time and suck it up once a week.\n\nRemind your parents that their job was to raise you until you were capable of living on your own and making your own decisions about your relationships. Wait a beat, and then thank them for doing a great job. Parenting is one job where doing your best results in getting fired.", "Gotta take care of urself B4 anything else. Ur folks sound codependant. Exhausting. Perhaps set clear boundaries & mean it. Attempting to force mom to \"like\" hubby? Yikes. Idk. Seem it's between hubs and mom. All best.", "I\u2019d say this is a soft YTA.\n\nYour parents do deserve an explanation as to why you haven\u2019t been keeping in regular contact with them. It\u2019s not fair to them for you to just ghost them, especially if they don\u2019t think they did anything wrong.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it can be mentally draining to deal with family drama. Since you already are mentally exhausted from working and going to college, it is a difficult task to deal with a daunting confrontation that you don\u2019t want to do.\n\nBut you should do it. They clearly don\u2019t think they did anything wrong while you lived with them, so at least you should give them a chance to explain themselves and/or apologize for the way they acted.", "A gentle YTA\n\nOnly because you want to have a relationship with them and ignoring them for much longer could hurt that even more. \nPerhaps try a conversation where you have built in excuse to have a short conversation? \u201cI just have a few minutes before class starts\u201d something like that. It\u2019ll help keep the conversation light and quick so she can\u2019t get into her life struggles. And even just talking to you for a few minutes could go a long way in helping build a bridge to communication where you will feel comfortable addressing the issues your struggling with.", "ESH - but OP remember this one opinion, please.  You will never understand how your parents' minds work, they will never understand how your minds work.  When you have your own children, you will never understand how their minds work, and they will never understand how your minds work.  That's why it's called a family.  You can't choose them, you can't get rid of them, but be glad that you can be there for each other.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI get parents can just add to things that mentally drain you, but life is going to keep doing that. This isn\u2019t a temporary thing because you\u2019re working and in school. In a few years it\u2019ll be something else. So make the time now to make it a habit. \n\nI call mine every few days during part of my commute home to check in. It\u2019s not always looked forward to but I\u2019m doing my part and after 15 min I tell her I\u2019m going to finish my commute with a podcast to decompress from work before getting home to my kids.", "NTA however there are clearly issues that need to be addressed and you're avoiding them.  If you feel they are disrespectful towards your husband, then you need to address it head on and be blunt.\n\nCall your mom, let her ramble and then get a clear answer from her about what you think about them disrespecting your husband.\n\nBe prepared to keep your cool, keep your tone level and clear.", "NTA. Some people talk to their parents everyday. Others do once every two months. It all depends on what people are comfortable with.\n\nAs for how to address your tension, try going to r/JUSTNOMIL. It's titled for \"mother in law\"s but they give advice on moms too and tips on how to set boundaries.", "NTA. I would just done quick text, \"we made it, were safe\" and NC for a while", "Oh, this one's easy. YTA. Once a week, at the very least, once a month, pick up that phone. Don't expect them to reach out to your husband. They want YOU, not him. You're young, thinking they're going to live forever. Oh, how wrong I was to think that.", "YTA. You sound just as exhausting as you say your parents are. It sounds like everything is about you. 30 minutes a week on the phone isn't much to ask. Maybe if you would spend less time making excuses not to do it, and just make that call, your mom wouldn't bombard you with texts.", "YTA. You were okay when you were using them for housing, but it's too to give them an occasional call.", "I get it, I just threw that in there because my mom finds everything stressful, her whole personality is stress. My entire junior and senior year of high school she quit her job so she could go back to school (because she suddenly wanted to be a Vet tech) which meant I had to get a job. She spent thousands of dollars on tests because she kept failing them and had to retake them. Now she has a vet tech job and just complains about it, you are right though those jobs are stressful, it's just after her talk for yearss about how much she wanted it it's kinda irritating.", "What a ridiculous idea to expect OP to talk to them EVERY DAY.", "The healing process isn't necessarily reconciliation, sometimes it's excision.", "Either create what you need to say to your parents about the past situation and work through it or realize it was a limited time stressful situation and move on. Either way, just icing them out of your life seems like YTA if this is all there is to the story.", "This, so hard. Phones go both ways. Its super amazing.", "Just noting that not everyone is fortunate enough to have a relationship with their parent where they will miss their parent like you describe.  Not saying that OP does or doesn\u2019t, just noting more generally that this isn\u2019t true for everyone, for valid reasons.", "All of this above!\n\nThere will be a day, mark my words, when you will wish you could have just one more conversation with your parents.  Heck, you'll wish you could have them nag you one more time, question you one more time, or tell you something not that important just ONE more time.\n\nAnd that time will not happen. And now I am in tears because of it.\n\nYes, YTA.", "My mother is dead. I don't miss her. Not everyone cares about that.", "Just noting that, depending on the circumstances, the fact someone will die one day is not alone enough of a reason for contact.  There are many circumstances where it may be better to have minimal or no contact than to be guilt tripped into contact because the person will die someday.", "Not necesserily. She might be happy about not getting texts guilting her every day.", "Peace, quiet, and tranquility at last!\n\n(And hopefully an inheritance too)", "Oh man, \u201cher entire personality is stress,\u201d my mom is the exact same. I totally get where you\u2019re coming from, it is easy to get dismissive when you have to listen to someone constantly complain about stresses that shouldn\u2019t be that big a deal, all while undermining your own (don\u2019t know if your mom does this, mine definitely does and/or takes on my stresses and makes them 100x worse). NTA for needing some space, I\u2019m in the same situation. I\u2019d highly recommend the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents for some perspective and tips on how to have a relationship with them going forward without totally burning yourself out.", "That would be ridiculous.

You can go NC for any reason or for no reason at all.", "Couldn't agree more, especially when it comes to their parents.", "Not a very confident driver? I'm quite relaxed behind the wheel even in LA traffic \n\nMy family relations are strained. I have just about all of my convos with them while driving. It's better than spending my personal at-home time on the call.
