I just don't know how better to put it.\n\nThrowaway btw.\n\nHi, I'm 14, I have 1 brother who's 15 and my sister who's 12. My dad died in 2020.In December, my mom suprised us my brother and sister with brand new phones, and me with a gaming laptop. I was so freaking happy that I was counting the days down until it was time to pick it up. (My mom was giving the gifts to us early)So, at the start of 2022, my mom introduced her boyfriend. As long as my mom was happy, I didn't care. The big \"event\" came on the night of Christmas. Basically, my brother accidentally woke up my mom. She was pisssed off, took our phones, and left. Then my mom's boyfriend came in, demanding our laptops and stuff (my brother had a chromebook) and it was scary. We both didn't realize he was slamming each laptop he got down as hard as possible until he left the room. I was extremely upset and just held my laptop for a little bit until my mom came in asking what happened with the single question after that \"Did you guys give him your laptops?\" I said yes That we did and she left the room. We heard them fighting and soon he left. Me and my brother we're so scared that we hid in the storage room. The laptop was done for. He slammed it so hard the battery fell out. We didn't get to see my brothers chromebook as my mom picked it up as she left. Eventually my sister came out from her room and talked with me. Then, my mom came out for the first time since it happened and said that HE WAS COMING BACK!?!? Honestly, I just asked her a single question. Why? She didn't answer and closed the door. When it was morning, we all sit down for a \"family meeting\". My mom's boyfriend just looked away the entire time while we talked and only talked when talked to. Basically, he blamed the whole thing on us! He didn't like how our rooms weren't perfectly clean. The part that made me angry the most? He said how he didn't like it that when he came back during the night he smashed the laptops, he didn't like how it wasn't. Clean. Honestly, what the fuck!? What the hell was he thinking?!? Ah yes, smashing laptops with get the room into perfect condition. While he did promise to replace the laptops, that doesn't fix anything. This should NOT BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. So, as a reminder that this happened, my brother and I took pictures of my laptop for a \"just in case\" sorta thing, and I taped the battery up on my wall. Soon, my mom asked me why it was there. I said it was a reminder of what happened on Christmas night. She got angry and said I should remove it. I stood my ground and said no. Like I said before, this is NOT something that should be ignored. Since then, they've been making comments about how it doesn't look good and should be taken down, and it's starting to wear me down. \nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675994199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yd4gc/aita_for_taping_my_laptop_battery_to_the_wall/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just have to walk on eggshells until I turn 18. That's my current plan at least.", "Thanks for the ideas. The really weird part is that they are freaking getting married. He has a lot of money, works at some sorta construction job.", "He did. I set it up myself to avoid him or anyone else from doing something to it. At this point everything is so crazy that he just might.", "Talk to everyone.  Teachers, school counselors, your doctor, the parents of friends whom you trust, etc.  \n\nAbusers very much rely on the victims keeping silent.\n\nI assume your laptop and your brother's chromebook were used, among other things, for school homework.  That makes this a problem for you at school, if you've lost work or can't complete assignments.\n\nSee if you can get a pay-as-you go flip phone for cheap, and keep it hidden.  If he becomes violent again, call the police. \n\nThere are a variety of people in your life who may be able to help you, if they know what is going on.  But you may not be able to figure out the right person in advance. Neither your mother or her boyfriend are owed any discretion from you about his behavior.  He acted this way, and there is no reason for the whole world not to know, if their knowing increases the chance of you finding help and safety. \n\nAdults will know various ways to help that you may not know.  You're guessing your grandmother could only keep you for two weeks, but those two weeks may buy you some time and safety to work with other adults to find a safe option.", "Your grandma might be able to help in other ways, though. Is she someone who would listen to you?", "I might just have to move out at 18.", "What about your sister?\n\nIf he does lay a hand on any of you someone needs to call 911.\n\nYour mom cannot be trusted.", "You have a lot more courage than I did at your age, taping the computer battery to the wall. It does remind your mom and her fiance about what they did. That's why they want you to take it down. They're ashamed.\n\nNot that their feeling guilty will prevent this happening again. Anger like this man demonstrated isn't the kind that you see on people who can control themselves. And since your mother let him come back, she can't be counted on to stop him.\n\nWrite down everything that happens, with pictures when possible, and email it to an account they can't get into. Maybe send it to a friend you can trust. Get your brother to do the same, in his own words, and your sister if you think she can handle it. That way, if you ever decide to tell anyone what's going on, you'll have documentation, with a time and date attached to it. That makes what you say very believable to people in authority.\n\nOf course, your documentation will only help if you tell an adult you need help. I notice that every time someone has said you should tell a teacher, you've said you'll just have to deal with it until you are 18. But four years is a very long time to live with someone who is violent and strong. Not to mention, your sister would still be there for another two years after you leave, dealing with it all alone. So really, I don't think waiting it out is your best option.\n\nHere's a website that will probably give you better information than a bunch of randomers on Reddit. If you scroll down a ways, there's a number you can call with questions. Maybe you can find out what would happen if you did tell CPS what's going on.\n https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/family-abuse.html\n\nYou just lost your dad, and you must be worried about losing your mom, too. Maybe these people can help you find a way to solve the problem before your mom marries this guy, because marriage will make it a lot harder for her to get rid of him, and without your mom losing custody of you. I'm pretty sure that's possible, because CPS likes to keep families together. But ask the experts, because they know more than any of us do. Good luck!", "Talk to your teachers at school, they're mandatory reporters for this sort of thing.", "I told my counselor about it at school after winter break.   She listened and just sat and talked to me.", "Me and her get along pretty well. I'm worried a my brother and sister right now. All I can do is vent secretly.", "Document evidence that things are abusive so you have proof to try get your sister out once you're out.", "My brother is the one who's brave. He called the cops on my dad on time when he was drunk. And I mean, REALLY drunk. He had 12 beers and was trying to leave using our car.", "I had a bit more courage mainly out of anger, if anything. I felt he was trying to erase my dad slowly but surely. \"Accidentally\" throwing out something we told him not to touch was somewhat common now that I look back on it.", "Thanks. I'll try with one of the teacher I trust the most.", "Talk with your safeguarding team. As much as you don't want to think so, he is dangerous and his violent tendencies have a very real possibility of being targeted at you and your siblings. You were soo scared you had to hide in a storage closet? That in itself should have been enough to warn CPS. Look into child helplines too.", "My brother said he was going to stay here for like 2 years after he was 18 cause of free rent", "Evidence will help your case. Even if you manage to survive to 18 to leave, your sister still has two years longer before she can do the same.\n\nDo not communicate anything to your mother or her boyfriend.

Your Mother is most likely going to have to attend parenting classes and the boyfriend will be removed. Keep calling, do not let up.

I am so sorry you are going through this. Talk to a teacher, talk to a counselor, talk to someone. This is super unsafe.", "Hi, waiting till you're 18 might seem like a good idea, but you've got younger siblings and you all really need to make sure that somebody- may be relatives on your father's side or some trusted teachers or family friends - know about this guy's violent temper.
