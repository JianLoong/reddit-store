(all names changed for privacy)\n\nSo my husband (27m 'Luke') and I (26f) welcomed our beautiful daughter 'Maisie' almost exactly 2 weeks ago now. We both love her so much and are so excited to finally be parents after a few miscarriages.\n\nWe didn't announce the name for our little one before the birth, because we didn't want to have anyone's opinion giving us second thoughts. As soon as we found out we were having a little girl, we decided on the name 'Maisie'. Both hubby and I have loved it since before we met, and when we first started trying for kids we agreed that our first girl would be named Maisie.\n\nWhen we announced the birth and her name, my mom texted me demanding that I change my daughter's name because that was her sister's name. I was confused since my mom only has brothers. She proceeded to remind me that around 6 months before my mom was conceived, my Nan had a miscarriage. From the story I was told, this was only around 12 weeks along the pregnancy, so Nan was just put on some meds to induce a period and they tried again. Of course, from 12 weeks you can know the baby's gender, but I was never told that they had given this little girl a name.\n\nTurns out that my grandparents decided to unofficially name this girl 'Maisie'. My mom, Nan, Grandad and uncles are demanding that I change the name of my daughter because that's \"a name that's already been taken\" and \"there are so many others out there, but you chose to disrespect us\". Hubby and I think that this is ridiculous. This aunt is someone I never met or will meet, her siblings never met her, and her parents never met her. Sure, miscarriages are hard, I know firsthand, but this one happened over 50 years ago. Surely they're over it, and I can use the name? No.\n\nMy Nan proceeds to post on her Facebook about how I am \"disrespecting her and her trauma\" and how I'm an \"entitled brat who only cares about herself\".\n\nI personally think that she's going too far, but am I the asshole for unknowingly naming my child after my deceased aunt?", "created_utc": 1693128978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162lx6n/aita_for_naming_my_daughter_after_my_miscarried/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I find this highly suspect.    \n\n\nThe way they are claiming a name you chose randomly, since you'd never heard it from them prior, was this long-lost aunt's name first so you can't use it and must choose a more suitable name reeks of their trying to control your choice.

Sounds like your family rather be upset than excited about a new family member.", "NTA. Unless there is some religious or cultural prohibition against giving a baby the same name as a long deceased relative, it is very puzzling that the whole family is so against the name. Many families would be pleased.  Families have secrets and things they don\u2019t talk about, but it is very odd that no one ever mentioned the deceased baby\u2019s \u2018unofficial\u2019 name. It is even odder that when you suffered a few miscarriages no one, not even your mother, ever mentioned how traumatized they were by the loss of a unborn baby 50 years ago. Since your mother wasn\u2019t even born then, my mind goes to there being something darker than a natural miscarriage, something that caused your grandmother such stress that she passed it on to her children, to the point of causing them emotional damage that has lasted half a century. You are NTA no matter what you decide but if you were to learn the truth about that miscarriage, you might prefer to change the name.", "NTA\n\nIf the name were so sacred to them, they should have made it known or discussed it with you when you were pregnant. They cannot now expect you to change your daughter\u2019s name.", "NTA and I'm sorry your family sucks.\n\nLet Nan know that while you undertand that she's upset, you didn't know before you named maise.

You didn\u2019t name your baby \u201cafter\u201d anyone. You had no idea that the name was going to be used for an aunt that was never born.", "NTA. How were you supposed to know about this miscarried baby if it was fifty years ago and no one ever mentioned it?", "NTA for using the name as you did not know. People have to stop gatekeeping names. \n\nYTA for saying \u201csurely they are over it.\u201d You don\u2019t get to decide when someone should end their grief. Obviously it was traumatic if 50 years later it\u2019s still a sensitive topic.", "NTA.  Obviously you didn\u2019t do this intentionally, but even if you did, surely this can be seen as a way to honour her memory not disrespect it!  I don\u2019t understand their attitude.

If anyone\u2019s an entitled brat, it\u2019s your Nan. You had no idea, and even if you did, they don\u2019t own the name.", "NTA.\n\nYou should probably just plan on cutting contact with them. They don\u2019t care about you at all.", "NTA. I like the name, you made a good choice.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe Surely they are over it comment is kinda asshole'ish, but I am assuming you didn't say that to their face and that you are articulating your thoughts instead. If you said that to their face that would AH territory.  \n\n\nThis just seems really bizarre to me. The way everyone is rallying it makes it sound like this is a big thing in the family and yet apparently you never heard of this family pact. I can see a family making a pact to not name any kids 'x' out of respect, but in that case everyone has to be read in on it, you can't just surprise someone with it. It almost sounds like they thought you were read in on it when you weren't which would be a big source of a feeling of 'disrespect'.", "NTA\n50 years ago they weren't even doing untrasound scans never mind chromosomal testing to find out the gender. You aren't a bloody mond reader,  if this mysterious \"aunt\" was never talked about how are you supposed to know her name. Cut off your family, it's clear they don't care about you or your child.", "NTA. Its a name, you didnt know. I would market it as a 'wow, the universe/god works in mysterious ways. maybe they wanted us to acknowledge the first masie more and sent us second masie to love and show how much we love first masie'", "NTA, because you didn't know the name was previously used in the family. I honestly don't know what I would do in your situation.", "NTA, and sadly it sounds like your family thinks they can guilt you into doing their bidding regardless of your feelings. It\u2019s disgustingly manipulative. \nMaisie is a beautiful name. Keep it.", "NTA I live in europe and to name your child the same name as an ancestor was a normal thing for a long time, some people actually donot to this day. If I recall correctly my mothers aunt has been named after her great grandmother and my mother was names named similar.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep the name. Your daughter is named, no reason to change that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My Nan proceeds to post on her Facebook about how I am \"disrespecting her and her trauma\" and how I'm an \"entitled brat who only cares about herself\".\" .. she is not sane - do not let her see your daughter, you need to protect her - you do not know what grandma is capable of in her mindless rage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd block her facebook so you don't see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu had NO way to know this. this is THEIR fault, not yours.", "Also they couldn't tell the gender at ALL back them until the baby was born. No ultrasounds, no blood tests. They just guessed it was a girl.", "agreed. If they never told you this, then how are you supposed to know not to name your child Maisie? \n\nNTA.", ">YTA for saying \u201csurely they are over it.\u201d You don\u2019t get to decide when someone should end their grief.\n\nPerhaps for the grandparents, sure, but should OP's mom and some(if not all) of her siblings be included in this? OP's mom wasn't even born yet when the miscarriage happened, and depending on the age of the othere, they may have not been alive either or old enough to remember.", "They are fine to grief. they are AHs to harass OP.", "Which seriously ups the squick factor.  That they are all so committed to this story about a 1970s pregnancy/miscarriage for no apparent purpose other than to steal the OPs joy and possibly control the new baby's name.", "I had forgotten about that, but you\u2019re absolutely right.  I was an early \u201880s baby.  I think my mom have had the option for a 20-week gender ultrasound with me, but that\u2019s all.  Certainly they wouldn\u2019t have known the gender of a first trimester miscarriage.", "Maybe they had to live through their mother\u2019s grief which can very traumatising. You have no idea, I have no idea and neither does she.", "I mean this could be a case of \"All babies are female until they're male.\" but even that much about fetal development may or may not have been general knowledge back in the late sixties/early seventies.  The first time I heard of it was in the 90s when I was reading Jurassic Park."]}
