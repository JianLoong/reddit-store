Three are adults. My fianc\u00e9 has one daughter (12) that is the same age as one of my kids. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e lost her job during the pandemic so I agreed she and her kid  could live with me. She now makes a small bit of income as a freelance photographer. (About $25k) I run a business and make in the mid six-figures.\n\nThe agreement was that she would do the house chores and help with my kids and I would pay the rent. She would also buy the groceries and pay the light bill.\n\nSo Christmas came and I wanted to go all out for my kids. I spent about $500 per kid. I did buy all the kids a pair of headphones ($30) and her kid was included. Her daughter loved the headphones, my fianc\u00e9e admitted. \n\nOn Christmas my fianc\u00e9e was upset because I gave my kids their presents in front of her daughter. She only bought her daughter a funny t-shirt, a photo album with their photos and a small cat figurine. She said I should not have given the big gifts to my kids in front of her daughter. ( It\u2019s MY house!)\n\nShe also said she had spent a lot of money on my kids throwing their birthday parties, decorating for the holidays, and hosting movie nights when they came to visit. She said I didn\u2019t warn her that I would be spending so much on my kids.\n\nMy ex-wife also complained that I spent way more than she could on the kids. \n\nIf I\u2019m paying for her and her kid to live in my house and only buy groceries and light bill, why am I the a\u2014\u2014? She should be grateful, especially since her daughter loved the gift.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680446252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129n4ae/aita_for_buying_my_own_kids_better_christmas/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Based on your attitude, I highly recommend you re-evaluate your relationship. Your fianc\u00e9 and her daughter do not deserve to be treated so poorly. Your actions may be saying far more about how you feel subconsciously then you are recognizing right now.

She\u2019s their mom too, you know. You could have been equal and less extravagant at Christmas, and maybe get other gifts throughout the year.

She obviously cares about being a family, planning and spending money on birthday parties. You bought her kid a pair of $30 headphones whilst surrounding her by your real kids opening $500 worth of gifts. This isn't your parents, this is you.

Three are adults. My fianc\u00e9 has one daughter (12) that is the same age as one of my kids. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e lost her job during the pandemic so I agreed she and her kid  could live with me. She now makes a small bit of income as a freelance photographer. (About $25k) I run a business and make in the mid six-figures.\n\nThe agreement was that she would do the house chores and help with my kids and I would pay the rent. She would also buy the groceries and pay the light bill.\n\nSo Christmas came and I wanted to go all out for my kids. I spent about $500 per kid. I did buy all the kids a pair of headphones ($30) and her kid was included. Her daughter loved the headphones, my fianc\u00e9e admitted. \n\nOn Christmas my fianc\u00e9e was upset because I gave my kids their presents in front of her daughter. She only bought her daughter a funny t-shirt, a photo album with their photos and a small cat figurine. She said I should not have given the big gifts to my kids in front of her daughter. ( It\u2019s MY house!)\n\nShe also said she had spent a lot of money on my kids throwing their birthday parties, decorating for the holidays, and hosting movie nights when they came to visit. She said I didn\u2019t warn her that I would be spending so much on my kids.\n\nMy ex-wife also complained that I spent way more than she could on the kids. \n\nIf I\u2019m paying for her and her kid to live in my house and only buy groceries and light bill, why am I the a\u2014\u2014? She should be grateful, especially since her daughter loved the gift.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Our parents had been dating for a matter of months. Not engaged. \n\nYou\u2019re a major AH. YTA so much it\u2019s laughable you felt the need to ask. Want to know why my stepdad got us equal value gifts? Because it was his way of letting ALL of us know that we have equal value under his roof. The same rule applies to all of our relatives, and all of us agree that this works best. The exception being my grandmother, since she had temporary custody of me as a kid, and sees me more as her own child than a grandchild, but she still gets my stepsibilings gifts of equal value as what my cousins are getting. And again, we kids have talked about this multiple times, and agree that it\u2019s been what\u2019s best for all of us, because it\u2019s a reminder to each other that we\u2019re EQUAL in our family home. There\u2019s less jealousy and resentment. We work well together, even as we are all VERY different people. My stepsister and I can only get on when for family game nights, and the only time my eldest stepbrother wants to even see me is during these times. My stepsister likes the socialization, and my stepbrother and I are exceptionally competitive people. Otherwise, NONE of us have anything in common. Our other stepbrother and I only hang out passively. It works, because none of our interests are treated as more valuable than others. My requests for books or new writing materials isn\u2019t seen as more or less valuable than streaming equipment, brand-name sneakers and headphones, or shopping gift cards and church stuff (don\u2019t ask me what this means, I\u2019m agnostic, and always volunteer to buy the gift cards before I even really know what she\u2019s asking for).

Your fianc\u00e9e did acknowledge that your gift of headphones was appreciated, so that\u2019s not the problem. \n\nPlease listen to both women when they point out how you\u2019re putting them in awkward positions in regards to gifts to the children.

You two need to sit down and have a real conversation about finances, and ways that you both contribute to chores and costs need to align with both your incomes. Just because she makes significantly less, doesn\u2019t mean she gets saddled with all the manual labor and has to spend all her money just to live there. In situations where one partner makes significantly more, there\u2019s more equitable ways to determine finances so that one person isn\u2019t basically feeling poor the whole time.

You also have after school activities. Unexpected things come up. If you want your kid raised right, you probably want to teach them how to do that laundry and have them helping you. \n\nand doing that laundry IS WORK. Editing your photos is work. Getting the groceries, cooking, cleaning the bathroom, all of that stuff \"you can do while the kid is in the background\" is work. And there are several other kids who have needs too. All of them with hours of their own homework, that alone is tough to manage. That is more than a full time job, it is like 3 full time jobs. \n\neta not to mention she is a stepmom to 4 of the kids, including the youngest and oldest. 15 is s TOUGH age to parent, teens are absolutely a full time job, they need a lot of support, they are becoming adults and things can go very wrong easily. He's asking her to be an unpaid nanny to FOUR of \"his\" children, but cant buy \"her\" kid an equal present.\n\neta 2: I wouldnt even take the job of managing 5 kids 10-15 for 40 hours a week bc it would wreck my health, and I was a nanny for over 20 years. She's expected to be available pretty much at all times, including the middle of the night, not just 40 hours. It's a LOT.", "Oh buddy no. As someone who worked in child care, it is still a full time job even at that age. And that's with one kid.", "How is it a full time job when the kid doesn\u2019t even live there the whole time and is in school a good part of the day?\n\nYeah, I\u2019m sorry, but letting you ten year old in the backyard alone is most definitely acceptable child rearing today.   I don\u2019t know what Facebook Moms group you are getting your info from but it\u2019s wrong.", "I have been a professional nanny since 2003 (as an adult, and before that worked with kids as a teen) and I am now a teacher.\n\nI don't know if any of my many clients over the years are on Facebook mom groups, but certainly the women you may see on Facebook talking about their childcare standards do, in fact, represent their community's childcare standards. I talk to parents I work for, parents I know, family members who are parents, and parents at my school. Those are the parents I have been talking to. I also read parenting literature and have taken some training. \n\nAs I said, even when the child is not with you, housekeeping and household management is full time work in itself. I listed some of the things that would include already. Even you mentioned laundry.\n\nThey are all living together. That laundry is 5 teens and pre-teens and two adults. Have YOU ever been solely responsible for that much laundry? that task alone in itself is not easy. \n\nAnd what is what is your childcare and household management experience?", "OPs 4 children do not live their full time.  \n\nI have been a nanny for many years, before becoming a child welfare attorney, teacher, and school administrator.   I can confidently say that it\u2019s absolutely typical for ten year olds to be in other parts of the home or yard with out adult supervision."]}
