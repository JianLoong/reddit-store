Three are adults. My fianc\u00e9 has one daughter (12) that is the same age as one of my kids. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e lost her job during the pandemic so I agreed she and her kid  could live with me. She now makes a small bit of income as a freelance photographer. (About $25k) I run a business and make in the mid six-figures.\n\nThe agreement was that she would do the house chores and help with my kids and I would pay the rent. She would also buy the groceries and pay the light bill.\n\nSo Christmas came and I wanted to go all out for my kids. I spent about $500 per kid. I did buy all the kids a pair of headphones ($30) and her kid was included. Her daughter loved the headphones, my fianc\u00e9e admitted. \n\nOn Christmas my fianc\u00e9e was upset because I gave my kids their presents in front of her daughter. She only bought her daughter a funny t-shirt, a photo album with their photos and a small cat figurine. She said I should not have given the big gifts to my kids in front of her daughter. ( It\u2019s MY house!)\n\nShe also said she had spent a lot of money on my kids throwing their birthday parties, decorating for the holidays, and hosting movie nights when they came to visit. She said I didn\u2019t warn her that I would be spending so much on my kids.\n\nMy ex-wife also complained that I spent way more than she could on the kids. \n\nIf I\u2019m paying for her and her kid to live in my house and only buy groceries and light bill, why am I the a\u2014\u2014? She should be grateful, especially since her daughter loved the gift.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680446252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129n4ae/aita_for_buying_my_own_kids_better_christmas/", "score": 718, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Based on your attitude, I highly recommend you re-evaluate your relationship. Your fianc\u00e9 and her daughter do not deserve to be treated so poorly. Your actions may be saying far more about how you feel subconsciously then you are recognizing right now.

She\u2019s their mom too, you know. You could have been equal and less extravagant at Christmas, and maybe get other gifts throughout the year.

She obviously cares about being a family, planning and spending money on birthday parties. You bought her kid a pair of $30 headphones whilst surrounding her by your real kids opening $500 worth of gifts. This isn't your parents, this is you.

Three are adults. My fianc\u00e9 has one daughter (12) that is the same age as one of my kids. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e lost her job during the pandemic so I agreed she and her kid  could live with me. She now makes a small bit of income as a freelance photographer. (About $25k) I run a business and make in the mid six-figures.\n\nThe agreement was that she would do the house chores and help with my kids and I would pay the rent. She would also buy the groceries and pay the light bill.\n\nSo Christmas came and I wanted to go all out for my kids. I spent about $500 per kid. I did buy all the kids a pair of headphones ($30) and her kid was included. Her daughter loved the headphones, my fianc\u00e9e admitted. \n\nOn Christmas my fianc\u00e9e was upset because I gave my kids their presents in front of her daughter. She only bought her daughter a funny t-shirt, a photo album with their photos and a small cat figurine. She said I should not have given the big gifts to my kids in front of her daughter. ( It\u2019s MY house!)\n\nShe also said she had spent a lot of money on my kids throwing their birthday parties, decorating for the holidays, and hosting movie nights when they came to visit. She said I didn\u2019t warn her that I would be spending so much on my kids.\n\nMy ex-wife also complained that I spent way more than she could on the kids. \n\nIf I\u2019m paying for her and her kid to live in my house and only buy groceries and light bill, why am I the a\u2014\u2014? She should be grateful, especially since her daughter loved the gift.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Our parents had been dating for a matter of months. Not engaged. \n\nYou\u2019re a major AH. YTA so much it\u2019s laughable you felt the need to ask. Want to know why my stepdad got us equal value gifts? Because it was his way of letting ALL of us know that we have equal value under his roof. The same rule applies to all of our relatives, and all of us agree that this works best. The exception being my grandmother, since she had temporary custody of me as a kid, and sees me more as her own child than a grandchild, but she still gets my stepsibilings gifts of equal value as what my cousins are getting. And again, we kids have talked about this multiple times, and agree that it\u2019s been what\u2019s best for all of us, because it\u2019s a reminder to each other that we\u2019re EQUAL in our family home. There\u2019s less jealousy and resentment. We work well together, even as we are all VERY different people. My stepsister and I can only get on when for family game nights, and the only time my eldest stepbrother wants to even see me is during these times. My stepsister likes the socialization, and my stepbrother and I are exceptionally competitive people. Otherwise, NONE of us have anything in common. Our other stepbrother and I only hang out passively. It works, because none of our interests are treated as more valuable than others. My requests for books or new writing materials isn\u2019t seen as more or less valuable than streaming equipment, brand-name sneakers and headphones, or shopping gift cards and church stuff (don\u2019t ask me what this means, I\u2019m agnostic, and always volunteer to buy the gift cards before I even really know what she\u2019s asking for).

Your fianc\u00e9e did acknowledge that your gift of headphones was appreciated, so that\u2019s not the problem. \n\nPlease listen to both women when they point out how you\u2019re putting them in awkward positions in regards to gifts to the children.

You two need to sit down and have a real conversation about finances, and ways that you both contribute to chores and costs need to align with both your incomes. Just because she makes significantly less, doesn\u2019t mean she gets saddled with all the manual labor and has to spend all her money just to live there. In situations where one partner makes significantly more, there\u2019s more equitable ways to determine finances so that one person isn\u2019t basically feeling poor the whole time.

Meaningless. \n\nYou make mid-6 figures (allegedly - not sure I believe this if your rent + bills are $1,900 and you make her buy your groceries, unless most of your income goes to child support?). She makes $25k. After taxes, she brings in $17,500, which is under $1,500/month. She\u2019s contributing almost her entire financial income AND picking up your slack where you are either incompetent or lazy in child and homecare responsibilities. And you\u2019ve proven to her that you are not husband or father material. Christmas gifts don\u2019t make up for what you lack in character; I hope your 7 (!!!) kids have a strong role model in their mother/s. You, based on this post and your comments, are cruel.

And she's cleaning ***and*** she's taking care of the kids.  \n\nIs all that really only worth 9% of the bills off from paying evenly?  You think her effort is only worth $300?  \n\nThe total is $3200.  You're paying $1900.  That's only $300 from half.  So the work she's doing is making up for that $300 difference from half.   She's doing waaaaaaay more than $300 worth.", "Another thing, if you are in a relationship with a single parent you don\u2019t get to ignore the kid(s) in front of your own kids.

Also you should compromise because she\u2019s cleaning up after, feeding, and buying food for you AND your SEVEN kids. Stop acting like she\u2019s a freeloader in a house you forced on her.

Also if your able to spend $2k that easily for your kids why not spend an extra $500 for your partners kid, he doesn't have to see her as a daughter and the daughter of his partner doesn't have to see him as a father Figure but when you earn ~$150k a year  $500 once a year for someone you should care about to enjoy Christmas and not feel neglected or unloved should be a no Brainer.
