More that your wife is taking you for granted, arranging stuff without telling you, and then expecting you to dog-sit. When you try to talk to her about it, she lashes out. \n\nI am sure that your wife probably feels frustrated too - her healthy husband is suddenly housebound and unable to participate in the things that she liked to do together with you. \n\nThis had lead to a breakdown of communication and lashing out. Time to put your big-boy pants on and have a real heart to heart about what is going on, me thinks.", "INFO: What is your suggestion that needs to change.

Were you disabled at the time of making the decision to get the dog?", "As someone that is chronically ill as well, I\u2019m gonna give you a soft YTA.\n\nYou are projecting your hurt about your inability to do things and your lifestyle change onto your wife. It\u2019s not her fault that your body is not doing what you want it to do anymore and youre punishing her for it by making her responsible for your jealousy. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be jealousy, but jealousy is your responsibility to work out, not your wife. You specifically say \u201caita for not expecting my limitations\u2026\u201d that\u2019s projection, my dude.\n\nAlso, is your wife your primary caregiver? If so, I\u2019d even lean more into the YTA, cause caregivers need breaks (and more frequently then non caregivers) to recharge to continuing caregiving. If you are already doing 75% of the work of the dog, 25% for two days to give your wife a break isn\u2019t asking a lot. \n\nYes, communication should be had prior to her planning the trip about dog care, and extra help should be lined up if need be\u2026 but we all know this isn\u2019t really about the dog. \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t stop blaming your wife for continuing to live her life as an able bodied person, you won\u2019t have a wife anymore.", "NTA. However, I notice that you're not really saying anything about what *you* want to happen to remedy the situation. You say why the current situation is not working for you, but nothing about you suggesting what should happen _instead_. Maybe that's an area where you need to be a bit more constructive. What changes do you want to make? Is that something that you've discussed?\n\nThe dog issue, though, is a separate thing. \nIt's one thing that she wants to do things you can't. I can understand why it sucks for you, but her position is also perfectly understandable.\nHowever, it seems like every time she does go on these trips, she just goes  \"oh, my disabled husband will take care of the dog for a couple of days while I go and live life\". That sucks. It's one thing to leave you behind, another to actively _burden_ you with full responsibility for duties that would normally be shared. You're picking up _her_ slack now, and that seems wrong to me. At the very least she needs to check with you ahead of time. Saying \"I'd like to go away that weekend, is that okay with you? Can you take care of the dog\" seems like a very low bar to clear, and she's not even doing that?", "YTA.  You want her to sit at home with you, so you whine about taking the dog out.  It isn\u2019t fair to limit her life also.  It\u2019s not a big deal to let the dog out.\n\nIf you are so ill you can\u2019t let the dog out, then have a conversation about what you are going to do with the dog you can\u2019t take care of.  Not a conversation about controlling her.", "NTA\n\nReading comments and all it sounds like you wish to not be sern as granted, to have more communication doing on and possibly wanting to be more involved like an equal partner not a child that's being informed by their mother that she's gone now.\n\nIt reads like you just want a bit more freedom but she takes it away by making you use the last bit of energy you got for yourself on the dog - while she's out. \n\nSure she's allowed to go, at the same time I cannot blame you for wanting all of thid and wanting to be seen as worthy of at least being *asked* if you have plans of any kind. \n\nHer lashing out like that wasn't okay.", "I think you should rehome the dog if you\u2019re having such a hard time taking care of it.  I\u2019d be pretty irritated if I wasn\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d to go out with my friends because I had to stay home and let the dog out to potty when I had a spouse there.", "It depends how you expressed your sadness to your wife. Telling her you have trouble accepting your limitations is totally fine. If it came out as resentment towards her than that's not okay. It's okay to feel that but you need to vent to someone other than her and recognise that your situation isn't her fault. I'm chronically ill so I get how hard it is to see everyone else continuing their lives as normal while you can't.\n\nYou are totally within your rights to be frustrated about the dog situation though. As someone with an energy-limiting illness I guess you have to pace yourself very carefully and the extra dog walks will mean you have to stop doing other important things. If it's proving too much for you then your wife should probably hire someone to help with it when she goes away or at least check in with you each time to ask if you need her to hire help.\n\nBased on what you've said here I'm going to say NTA but it depends on the specifics of what you said to your wife. I would be interested to hear her side.", "NTA Its not fair that she ditches the dog on you, which seems to consume your energy for the day.  however you need to sort out what exactly you want. Do you want less activities with her so you have energy left to do stuff alone/with others? Or are you angry at the situation that you just have less energy? Whatever it is you need to tell her and then try to find a solution.", "NTA- sounds like you need to come to some agreement on how often weekends away can happen\u2026", "NTA - pets can be a bind and it is unfair when one person gets landed with expectation of care.

Your situation is unbalanced in that your wife gets weekends away without or with a different set of responsibilities and you don't. \n\nSo what can you do about it in practical terms? Chronic illness and its limitaitions are very hard to come to terms with (had one since age 15). What holidays can you do? Are there any gentler excursions you both would enjoy? Can you board the dog for at least some of the weekends - yes, cost and risk but might help the resentment?\n\nYour resentments at life are totally valid but they can poison relationships. Generally better to work together to find a solution.", "Just have the dog put down, end of story.", "She\u2019s growing apart from you and is beginning to see you as an obstacle to living her life the way she wants. \n\nIt is understandable she would want to be active at times alone, but to lack empathy for you and your situation puts her in the wrong.

This makes it a much bigger ask than just staying at home.", "If it was your idea to get the dog, than it is your responsibility.

You can touch it and move it and pass it. Well, let\u2019s say your jealousy is that ball. You took that ball out of the closet, and you are holding it. It hurts you to hold onto it. So you don\u2019t want to hold it anymore, you want to pass it. But your wife didn\u2019t take the ball out of out the closet and honestly, the ball is too awkward and big for her to hold. It\u2019s not her responsibility to put it back or hold. It\u2019s yours to put away and deal with. If you don\u2019t know how, get help. Cause holding that ball that doesn\u2019t fit her hands will hurt her.\n\nSo like, you\u2019re mad and upset your life has changed and you can\u2019t go hiking the way you used to (I\u2019m using my own example as my life dramatically changed at age 33.) and you wife can hike still.\n\nInstead of being mad at the real culprit (the illness, etc) that you can\u2019t hike anymore, which you can\u2019t really do because the illness doesn\u2019t have a face or voice to yell at, your anger is leaking out onto the closest face to you, your wife. \n\nUnless she went at your knees with a crowbar, she didn\u2019t cause you\u2019re current predicament. And it\u2019s not fair for you to put her on the receiving end of your blame and anger/frustration/sadness, which she didn\u2019t cause. This will burn her out fast. \n\nYour mind is searching for someone to blame for your current icky feelings\u2026 but it\u2019s not your wife, my dude.\n\nYour wife didn\u2019t even cause your jealousy, if she wasn\u2019t there, you\u2019d be jealous of any able bodied person doing the same thing, which are things your body can\u2019t do anymore. \n\nWith illness, there isn\u2019t anyone to blame and these are feelings you yourself need to come to terms with. You\u2019re life has changed, not everyone else\u2019s is going to be on the same pace as yours and you need to come to terms with that. I really recommend talking to someone, like a grief counselor because it sounds like you are current grieving your old life. \n\nAlso, when I use the term \u201ccaregiver\u201d I don\u2019t mean a nurse or someone physically moving your body for you or wiping your bum, I mean someone that is handling making all your meals, laundry, and doing the household chores you\u2019d do if you were able bodied. This can also be the person that picks up more shifts to make ends meet to cover for the sick person, the person that is mentally responsible for pill management, or the person who just helps make the doctors appointments. Basically, caregivers pick up the slack of the stuff you can\u2019t do anymore do to disability, including exhaustion/chronic fatigue.\n\nIs she taking on more now that you are limited in this way? If so, she is your caregiver.", "so you want her to board your dog even though you\u2019ll be at home?\n\nyou realize that makes no sense and is cruel to the dog, right?", "You are staying home, if you\u2019ve already reached your max leaving home.  You don\u2019t leave the house.  So what\u2019s the problem?", "OK, so you're not planning on staying home, so have you informed your wife of your plans? Maybe you two could get a shared calendar and you both could add your plans there and then together figure out the dog care.", "Is this a service dog?", "Then this is your dog, and your responsibility. If you don\u2019t want the dog for the weekend, arrange for a dog walker.", "You'll find a way, just as you always have.", "People don\u2019t always talk about it, but when you\u2019re sick for a long time, you also lose a lot of friends\u2026. Or at least you see people less due to lack for shared interests that you can actually do with your \u201cnew\u201d body. \n\nI personally got very ill about four years ago and lost so much of my life, especially social life, due to my limitations. \n\nI ended up having surgery about six months ago and improved a bit, but not a lot. Just enough improvement to have enough energy to be social every once and a while.  \n\nSince I had not seen so many people in so long, it was hard to restart old friendships. Also, I felt bad for basically ghosting a lot of people while being sick. It was just awkward.\n\nI love my partner so much and I love our mutual friends, and my friends through him. So i thought, easy social anxiety fix! I\u2019ll just tagalong with everything my partner did, especially if plans were with mutual friends!!! \n\nBut I quickly had to relearn that my partner and I each need 1) friendships we have together with others as a couple, 2) we needed friendships we have with the same person individually, and 3) we need friendships that are just our own. \n\nAlso, just because my partner is hanging out with Stan, and I\u2019m also friend with Stan, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a group hang invitation. My partner may need alone hangs to vent to Stan or just along hangs to exist outside of me, and that\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s just autonomy.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, my life and illness didn\u2019t just change my life, it\u2019s changed my partner\u2019s and my illness does take up lot of my partner\u2019s time and energy too. He has picked up so much more because I wasn\u2019t able-bodied anymore. And his life is just different now that I\u2019m different. So he needs to have space where he doesn\u2019t have to bare the yoke of that. \n\nI know there are so many days I wish I could just \u201ctake off\u201d my illness, like an old coat. And hang it up and just be my old self. And my partner needs that too, with me in the room and by themselves.", "Excellent comment!", "True. But she's clearly afraid that communicating instead of notifying might also lead to me saying \"sorry, i know you're going away tomorrow but i don't feel fit enough\".....", "Nope, family decision predating the current situation.", "So you think i'm trying to pass the ball to her? I wish i could see that myself, before doing so. \n\nRight now i'm completely independent with the exception of her having to do most of the longer distance driving when we're out together. In terms of chores, i do all daily ones during the week. Other days it's an even split.", "I would like her not to just assume i'll be there to take care of the dog.

So she can notify me \"i'll be away on ... going through... and i've checked, we can bring the dog to day care if necessary\".", "Is sounds like the OP has only a certain amount of energy to do anything - and it is WAY LESS than a normal person - if the dog is left in OPs care then that energy is already spoken for and cannot be expended on anything OP might find pleasant and actually be able to do.   \nimagine if you will that you can absolutely only do 10 things in a day. No matter what. Getting up is a thing, getting washed and dressed is a thing.

Count them - if OP is left with the dog then two things to get ready to walk the dog (can\u2019t be done in bed) and 4 dog walks mean the OP barely has it in them to eat a single meal themselves and sit in a chair to watch a show - no matter what - and this keeps happening because wife want to fit in extra fun things specifically and only for her. How and why is this fair?", "I'm not OP, but I think a prior discussion, coming to an agreement that the dog is cared for, not just OP's wife informing him that she's going and no conversation about dog care.

I hope you get to a place to be able to drive again. \n\nUnfortunately, My illness makes me much more reliant on my partner than before I got sick.

Maybe that time can be used on outings new hobbies you maybe interested in?", "Dude, I understand the fear...\n\nBut, think about this:\n\n\\-If that was the case, she would have probably already left\n\n\\-Nothing you do in fear will lead up to something good in your life. Fear can be great to keep you alert in a tough threatening situation, but this is not it. So, you have to control your fears.\n\n\\-If she ever leaves for another man, she leaves. You can't force anyone to love you. And it's something that happens every day, to people without any physical problems. Again, you have to control your fears\n\n\\-I completely understand how frustrated you are. I have some colapsed disks in my cervical and I went from a guy who used to lift industrial gas bottles (around 100kg) with ease from the ground to a truck, and now there are days I just strugle to get out of bed. But she is also, for sure. So, starting to simply lash out won't do anyone good, just put more strain in the relationship.\n\n\\-Comunicate with her that when she wants sets up something that will keep her away and doesn't involve you, it would be nice to know before the plans are set in stone. It's basic comunication and shows care. Her simply saying that she is going to do something without telling you first it's bordering on disrespectfull, and lack of respect creates resentment and kills love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you both can figure this out\n\nAll my best wishes", "Honestly, yes and no. He is an incredible individual and I have no doubt he could find another person to have another great partnership with, if he chose to. I have even told him that if it ever gets to be too much, I would totally understand if he had to walk away and I wouldn\u2019t blame him. It\u2019s not his body or his illness. He has that option to leave. But he chooses to stay and be with me and love me. Why would I continue to question that when he is clearly making this choice? \n\nAdditionally, i know that every single person on this planet is dealing with something, some more than others. I had an ex that would say \u201cthe hott ones always have IBS.\u201d Someone always has a hidden illness. \n\nMy partner likes to remind me that anyone can get sick at anytime. Almost everyone who grows old will experience long term illness. So if it\u2019s not with me now, it\u2019s with someone else in short order. And he\u2019s rather be with someone that he can talk, laugh, and cry through it with. \n\nIs that fear there? Yes, it always is in relationship that aren\u2019t extremely convenient\u2026. But I chose not to feed the flame because why? Because I get to be with the someone i love while I\u2019m still alive in this present moment (even if it\u2019s a different life than I had imagined) and I\u2019m going to enjoy that while I can.", "Thank you!", "No, i just bite the bullet. As long as i dial back my own activities and take plenty of rest i'll be oke.", "It helps that most comments point out that i do appear to communicate being jealous. Not that i want to obviously. My wife had a really tough time during the first 10 years. She really deserves all the fun she can get.", "Why can\u2019t she tell him about her plans? Why op need to be the only one who communicates his plan to her?", "I don't want her at home.", "It's the default for 4 years now. The shared calendar is an excellent idea. A dog sitter is an option too, it just bothers me that she told me i have to arrange for one if she plans a day away.", "I still feel like a burden. I'm not bur i can't shake that thought.", "OK, could your wife be a bit correct with what she said to you, could there be a smidgen or truth in ***\"telling me i'm basically jealous of her going weekends away with her BFF (yes, i am because my disease prevents me from doing the same), that i don't want her to spent time with her BFF (nope, that's a good friend of mine too who absolutely deserves the attention) and that i use the dog as excuse to complain...\"***?\n\nYou're being a bit unfair to your wife here, biting the bullets and painting scenarios that haven't happened. I think you're (fairly and unfairly) jealous of your wife being so active with your shared children and her friends, when you can't do the same. You're right, that you deserve better communication, but it goes both ways. You need to actually figure what you're upset about, and what you are expecting to change. You need to work on the dog care together, too.", "She can basically plan what she wants. I have to plan taking into account my current health situation. I more or less have to seize the day or go into energy saving mode a week prior to an event. Her planning weeks in advance means less opportunity for me to jump to the occassion, because that evening, day or weekend is already taken.\n\nIt would help if she didn't just notify me about another evening, day or weekend (we're literally talking weekly here) but notify me including a proposal for taking care of the dog.\n\nAnd it's not painting a scenario that didn't happen. I have been way, way worse. I don't ask her not to go because that would be cruel in my eyes. I just bite the bullet.  And yes, that happens multiple times per month."]}
