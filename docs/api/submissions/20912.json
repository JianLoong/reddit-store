Jake says, she's a kid, give her time, she'll get better, and to ease up on her cause it's not a big deal.\n\nRecently, past 3-4 weeks, Kari has gotten in the habit of tossing her dishes into the sink. Usually from halfway between the dining table and sink, which is several feet. The problem is, all my dishes are either ceramic or glass, which means when they land they are getting shattered. I'm at the point of using paper plates, cups and bowls because I don't have enough dishes anymore.

I'm done being disrespected in my home.

Where is she getting the idea that she can be rude to you and careless with your things?  \n\n\nI think you should rethink your relationship with your BF. Even Brad Pitt wouldn't be worth this crap.", "Oh, Hell No, she's 21 but acts that way????  I'd kick her butt out so fast.  NTA.", "NTA  \nSo you plan to marry a man who didn't teach any respect for others in his child, is okay with you being treated like crap and now is making you the villain. The first time was an oops, every other broken plate was an intentional act. \n\nShe has to go and he should probably be right behind her.", "NTA she's terrible and he's an enabler.", "NTA at 21 she is acting like a child and it\u2019s not fair to you. If she really did not get the proper upbringing and if her dad really does want to have her living there and give her another chance, he needs to step up and take responsibility for enforcing the house rules, and making sure the things get done properly and broken things get replaced.\n\nI\u2019m all for letting young adults get on their feet at home but this is a childish brat who is going to have a difficult life for herself and those around her if she doesn\u2019t change some things now. \n\nEither get your fianc\u00e9 to step up on this or kick them both out.", "NTA - it would be helpful if you stated Kari\u2019s age which makes this difficult to judge. But regardless of her age, your fianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter should know better than to throw breakable dishes.   \n\nYour primary concern is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s unwillingness to do anything about her behavior. Since they moved in with you, it\u2019s your home and they should respect that. You have a HUGE fianc\u00e9 problem & should not marry him until the problems with his daughter are resolved. You have a mess on your hands.", "NTA. Both of them need to go. Make an inventory of everything she\u2019s broken and demand reimbursement. Neither of them are showing any respect for you or your home.", "NTA - she doesnt respect you and he needs to be helping more with correcting her actions", "NTA. Your problem is with Jake, who is enabling Kari to utterly disrespect you in your home. I hope HE is the one who is running around cleaning up all her messes, but somehow I don't think so. Don't be a doormat maid for him.", "NTA.\n\nI initially had thought you were talking about a bratty little kid with her attitude and her dad being so lenient about it... but she's 21?? She is an adult and needs to get her life together, she's way past her behavior being even remotely excusable. She clearly has been breaking your dishes on purpose and she needs to replace them. If she doesn't she needs to find a new place to live, if she does, honestly she still needs to move out.", "NTA - You need to kick both Jake and Kari out.", "NTA. I came into my stepdaughter's life when she was 6, and she never broke a plate putting it into the sink or the dishwasher. The one time she dropped and broke a bowl because she was being careless and continued horsing around despite being told to be careful, she cried and felt so guilty that she bought her Dad chocolate in apology with her pocket money (it was from a set which had been given to him as a present and therefore had sentimental value, but it was no longer sold therefore not replaceable). She wasn't even 10 yet at that point.  \n\n\nOP, before you get tied down in marriage, I suggest couples therapy. If you ditch the fiance, the stepdaughter problem goes away too. Just sayin'.", "NTA.  They both need to go.  Anyone that is condoning their 21 year old daughter to disrespect another persons property is NOT someone you want to be with.", "NTA, but Jake is a huge AH. Not only did he recently move in with you, but now his adult daughter also moved in and is blatantly disrespecting you. \n\nHis enabling and failure to discipline his adult daughter who just moved in is one thing. Her giving attitude to you, and him not supporting you is the second. Him getting angry at you while forcing you in the awkward position of disciplining his daughter (who at 21 should know better) is beyond AH behavior. \n\nI\u2019m afraid you have some serious issues you need to address with Jake before getting married. There is a slew of red flags in this post alone. It will be a delicate but necessary dance since it is about his daughter.", "NTA. Get both of them out of your house.", "INFO how old is she", "NTA Either your boyfriend's 21 year old, unemployed daughter is about as clever as a box of rocks or she's breaking your dishes purposefully to annoy you. If your boyfriend wants to baby his sloppy, hot mess of an adult child, you may be at a crossroads in your relationship. You need to evaluate if this situation is one you can live with long term, if not, it's time to move on.", "6 months, why are they still living with you and planning on marrying him.  Did you call him out on him calling you a bitch", "NTA she knows what she is doing and knows she is getting away with it. I would not stay with the dad ether tho this will probably continue to be a theme. how old is she tho?\n\nedit: she is 21!!! that's my age and she does not work? even I work summers and do things around the house. she needs to go she knows what she's doing and its only going to get worse as her dad continues to protect her. 21 is not a child that is a young adult.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve better than this man.", "INFO : Who does Kari\u2019s laundry and who cleans up all the broken glass?", "Kick em both out. NTA.", "NTA say by felicia as he leaves cuz he aint worth it if he excuses that behavior", "He should be on the way out just behind SD. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI think they both need to leave, but in the meantime you can take everything out of the kitchen and put a couple of children's sets in the cupboard. Maybe they'll get some perspective if they have to drink from a sippy cup and try to hold a tiny plastic spork to eat out of a dish that suctions to the table. Or maybe they won't, but even if they chuck them at the wall they won't be breaking them.", "NTA ~~per se, in that I don't think it's an unreasonable way to teach her to be more responsible and respectful of other peoples' things.~~\n\n~~Having said that, you get that Jake is the one that raised Kari right? Like he said, she's just a child, so why isn't *he* the one you're talking to about how he's raising his child?~~\n\n~~Knowing how old Kari is would've been helpful too~~\n\nCutting myself off to start over because I just saw you comment elsewhere that Kari is *twenty-one.* She's not a kid she's a grown-ass woman. Fuck yeah she can pay for your dishes.\n\nHaving said that, don't cut Jake too much slack here either, he's the one that raised her to be like this. His response to her carelessly smashing your dishware is \"she's a kid, give her time, she'll get better, ...ease up on her cause it's not a big deal.\" it's no wonder she grew up this way. Yeah, her behavior is shitty and at 21 years of age it's high past time she learn some basic responsibility, but don't lose sight of who raised her to be this way and is continuing to enable her.\n\nI especially love the \"she'll get better,\" yeah, Jake, I'm sure just one more year under her belt of you reinforcing that she will never face any consequences for any action she takes and she'll finally learn some responsibility.", "Not at all. You are literally describing my early life.\n\nJake will be of no use to you, and he is showing himself to be a terrible father and husband. You might want to reconsider this relationship.", " NTA  Next time they both leave the house, put their belongings in the front yard and change the locks.", "NTA. KICK THEM BOTH OUT!", "Nopes. NTA.\n\nYou're being disrespected on two sides. \n\nThis is your home.  Is Jake on the lease/mortgage?

Wouldn\u2019t the sensible and logical thing be for your partner to tell his kid that she just needs to stop throwing them in the sink. What the fuck", "NTA  the father and daughter are both losers.", "Why don\u2019t you ask them to go in on some non breakable dinnerware together? Then you can put your nicer dishes away and only bring them out for special occasions? \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but you\u2019re probably not gonna get out of this w/o compromising.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
