She is an adult and needs to get her life together, she's way past her behavior being even remotely excusable. She clearly has been breaking your dishes on purpose and she needs to replace them.

I came into my stepdaughter's life when she was 6, and she never broke a plate putting it into the sink or the dishwasher. The one time she dropped and broke a bowl because she was being careless and continued horsing around despite being told to be careful, she cried and felt so guilty that she bought her Dad chocolate in apology with her pocket money (it was from a set which had been given to him as a present and therefore had sentimental value, but it was no longer sold therefore not replaceable). She wasn't even 10 yet at that point.  \n\n\nOP, before you get tied down in marriage, I suggest couples therapy. If you ditch the fiance, the stepdaughter problem goes away too.

Not only did he recently move in with you, but now his adult daughter also moved in and is blatantly disrespecting you. \n\nHis enabling and failure to discipline his adult daughter who just moved in is one thing. Her giving attitude to you, and him not supporting you is the second. Him getting angry at you while forcing you in the awkward position of disciplining his daughter (who at 21 should know better) is beyond AH behavior. \n\nI\u2019m afraid you have some serious issues you need to address with Jake before getting married.

Meanwhile, you are entirely unwilling to parent her, pretending she is just a kid. No, she's a 21-year old adult who is no longer welcome in my home.

You say she tosses them in the sink and when confronted says \"Ooops\".  She knows what she's doing.\n\nClearly, her life is a bit of a mess - not in school or work.  She has her father wrapped around her little finger and part of her disrespectful behaviour towards you may be an attempt to separate you and her father.  My other thought is that this behaviour is an attempt to gain 'control' in the house.  She is creating a situation where she can be as difficult and defiant as she wants and no one will 'check' her thereby letting her live her life anyway she wants.  Her father is 'on  her side' and she is counting on that.\n\nHowever, it seems as if events have reached a stage where you have to decide what you are willing to do to regain peace and happiness in your own home.

I thought maybe mom died and 12 yo Kari was acting out. Still requires consequences, but gently. And even a preteen could have found a way to pay for it. I accidentally broke dishes when I was washing them at 11. I did extra chores to pay for them. 21 yo who decided not to work and not too go to college can absolutely get a job and start paying for herself, plus penalties for destruction of property.\n\nOr are you talking about the bf letting a 21 yo walk all over his supposed gf and not caring? That's never acceptable or understandable.", "Good, then you can kick them both the hell out.
