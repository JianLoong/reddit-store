Then 2 months later his daughter, Kari, moved in with us. \n\nKari is lazy. She doesn't do chores, no cleaning or cooking, not even her own laundry. She leaves a mess everywhere she goes, doesn't listen when I ask her to help out, rolls her eyes and continuously mocks me. Jake says, she's a kid, give her time, she'll get better, and to ease up on her cause it's not a big deal.\n\nRecently, past 3-4 weeks, Kari has gotten in the habit of tossing her dishes into the sink. Usually from halfway between the dining table and sink, which is several feet. The problem is, all my dishes are either ceramic or glass, which means when they land they are getting shattered. I'm at the point of using paper plates, cups and bowls because I don't have enough dishes anymore. I've told and snapped at Kari to stop many times, but she does it anyway, giggles say oops, sorry, guess I forgot, and practically skips out of the kitchen. \n\nI ended up telling Jake that either Kari finds a way to pay for the dishes she's broken or she can go live with her mom or grandparents. I'm done being disrespected in my home. Jake says I'm being a total bitch towards his child, she has no job, it's unfair to kick Kari out and if I do, he will never forgive me for being so cruel as to make Kari feel this isn't her home, too.

Where is she getting the idea that she can be rude to you and careless with your things?  \n\n\nI think you should rethink your relationship with your BF. Even Brad Pitt wouldn't be worth this crap.", "Oh, Hell No, she's 21 but acts that way????  I'd kick her butt out so fast.  NTA.", "NTA  \nSo you plan to marry a man who didn't teach any respect for others in his child, is okay with you being treated like crap and now is making you the villain. The first time was an oops, every other broken plate was an intentional act. \n\nShe has to go and he should probably be right behind her.", "NTA she's terrible and he's an enabler.", "NTA at 21 she is acting like a child and it\u2019s not fair to you.

Don't be a doormat maid for him.", "NTA.\n\nI initially had thought you were talking about a bratty little kid with her attitude and her dad being so lenient about it... but she's 21?? She is an adult and needs to get her life together, she's way past her behavior being even remotely excusable. She clearly has been breaking your dishes on purpose and she needs to replace them.

I came into my stepdaughter's life when she was 6, and she never broke a plate putting it into the sink or the dishwasher. The one time she dropped and broke a bowl because she was being careless and continued horsing around despite being told to be careful, she cried and felt so guilty that she bought her Dad chocolate in apology with her pocket money (it was from a set which had been given to him as a present and therefore had sentimental value, but it was no longer sold therefore not replaceable). She wasn't even 10 yet at that point.  \n\n\nOP, before you get tied down in marriage, I suggest couples therapy. If you ditch the fiance, the stepdaughter problem goes away too.

Her giving attitude to you, and him not supporting you is the second. Him getting angry at you while forcing you in the awkward position of disciplining his daughter (who at 21 should know better) is beyond AH behavior. \n\nI\u2019m afraid you have some serious issues you need to address with Jake before getting married.

She left him as soon as the plane landed. He went to AA and stopped drinking, but even Brad Pitt can get dumped.", "Really buried the lede there lol. I thought she was going to be 14-15 max \ud83d\udc80", "Kick them both out of your house.  At the very least, stop cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry for them.  They can fend for themselves.  You're letting them make a fool out of you.", "Absolutely inappropriate behaviour! OP you\u2019re NTA but you deserve better than this. Why isn\u2019t your SO concerned about your possessions being damaged/destroyed?", "And she doesn't know you don't throw dishes in the sink because they break and forgets after being reminded?", "They don't respect you or your property. Get rid of them before they do something worse than just break some dishes", "Well if u decide to somehow marry this guy make sure u get a prenup", "Oh, no.  No no.  Definitely out of your house.", "Stop cooking for them, and kick them out.  YTA if you let them stay in YOUR HOME.", "Nope. Kick them both out. Jake will never stop the enabling.", "Were you this useless at 21? What about Jake?", "This is probably why she is the way she is and why you will never win. For whatever reason (guilt?), he coddles her. Which means he will never back you up. So you are sol there. \n\nCalling you a bitch proves he has no respect for you. \n\nSo what does he do for you?", "An eviction would damage his credit. Which is a good reason for him to leave when she tells him to leave.", "Where was he living before?", "Except...you know...that she's not a kid and is doing this deliberately.  Again, he can go find a place to live with her that is not your house.", "Your definitely NTA. However, if you put up with this shit, not just her complete lack of respect to you, but also your fiance's lack of respect to you, then you can reap the consequences. \n\nHow do you expect to build a life together with someone who calls his 21!! year old daughter a kid and excuses terrible behaviour toward the person he is supposed to love?", "I know your probably hesitant to end your engagement and relationship but if your fianc\u00e9 is willing to dismiss everything it\u2019s only going to get worse after you guys tie the knot. Please do yourself a favor and get out of this relationship. People often stay because they\u2019re scared to start over especially after investing a lot into the relationship. But your future self will probably thank you for saving yourself from an even bigger headache. I think you know deep down inside that the is isn\u2019t the marriage you should be getting yourself into. Your future step daughter is way too old to be acting like this. And your fianc\u00e9 enables that behavior.", "OMG WTF. \n\nThis ADULT breaks all of your dishes while mooching off or you and you want to COMPROMISE!?!?  Are you a doormat?  Are you desperate?  This is ridiculous. She is a ADULT not a child. She knows what she is doing. She doesn\u2019t contribute and is walking all over you and you are letting her do so. \n\nSounds like her father is just as bad as he is enabling her. \n\nKick the daughter out at the very least. She needs to pay rent and to replace your dishes. There is no reason to purchase non breakable dishes. That is the dumbest thing I have seen on the internet today.", "She\u2019s just going to find something else to break. This isn\u2019t just a dishes problem, this is purposeful destruction of your things. Does she ever break her own stuff? Her dad\u2019s things? Or just yours? Does it happen when she\u2019s other places or you aren\u2019t there, or only when she can see the reaction she\u2019s getting from you? Does she act like this at her mom\u2019s, or when she\u2019s with her grandparents? \n\nI think she needs to be smacked with some reality. She\u2019s disrespecting the person whose house she\u2019s staying in (I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s yours, from your wording), and isn\u2019t a child that you\u2019re legally obligated to continue caring for. She needs to learn that you don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you, and you need to put your foot down. Frankly, I\u2019d suggest leaving them both in the dust, because he\u2019s never going to do anything but support her poor behavior, but you need to set rules and boundaries for her at a bare minimum.", "No its not shes going to find some other way to piss you off....shes pissing you off on purpose! The man of your dreams thinks her italian smashing the plates is perfectly normal!", "That\u2019s not the issue.  Kari is intentionally causing you issues and being disrespectful on purpose.  You can\u2019t compromise with that\u2026. Even if they agree there will be something else.\n\nShe is 21.  Are you telling me she has gone 21 years without ever learning how to use glass or ceramics? She knows what she is doing", "Yeah that boyfriend is too much.", "I got married and moved abroad for grad school at 22. I assumed OP was talking about like a 10 year old, who should still know better.", "The fact that she\u2019s an adult blows me away. I was picturing a snide little 13 year old.\n\nFor an adult child to act like this is beyond unacceptable. The fact that Jake is blind to his daughter doesn\u2019t sit well with me; I\u2019m livid on your behalf, OP.\n\nEdit to add: not even a tiny bit of AH. In fact, I think you\u2019re a saint for holding it together. By the 3rd broken dish, I would have lost my mind.", "He doesn't know how to deal with it. This family needs some counseling.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! Get some cheap kid plastic plates (they come in different colors) and those are the only ones she can use. Maybe even get her the toddler spoon and fork sets.", "Thanks", "Yeah. I'd accept a small kid of <8 going \"Look how well I can throw!\". Exactly once.", "Yes, and they can be addressed after he finds a new place for him and his adult daughter to live separate from op's home.", "He called the 21 year old with no job a kid and cleans her room and does her laundry. He\u2019s beyond \u201caddressing issues\u201d. I woulda kicked his ass out with his lazy ass \u201ckid\u201d out the house several dishes ago", "definitely not as bad as this sitch", "No she doesn\u2019t forget she giggles. Holy moly. I would be in serious trouble. Actually no I wouldn\u2019t. The second time this happened guess what is getting thrown out the door? The two of them and all of their stuff.", "Oh 100% but Daddy's lil princess would never!", "If anyone thinks she *isn't* doing it on purpose, I have some very rare rocks to sell that I totally didn't just grab from my backyard. /s\n\n(I hope you can tell this isn't a dig at you. It's just my smartass way of agreeing and saying the dad can't possibly be stupid enough to think it's an accident, but if he is, a fool and his money are soon parted.)", "We've had dogs that could get glass dishes off the counter without breaking them or spilling the contents.", "Yep. If she is going to act like a child, she can be treated as one", "If you truly want to have a relationship with Jake despite everything you need to understand, he's always going to put his child first.\n \nHis child is literally acting like a baby instead of a 21-year-old who should know better.  He knows this and he still calling you the bad guy in the scenario.\n\nSo if you still want to maintain a relationship with Jake, don't live together.  Maintain separate households.  See how it goes.\n\nIn a best case scenario, he sees the mess to a point where he puts on his parent pants and puts his foot down and changes things and apologizes to you.\n\nOr you can watch the dumpster fire from the safety and security of your own home.\n\nShort of him realizing and apologizing to you of his own initiative.", "You don\u2019t. Hell always treat her like a kid and coddle her so just kick both of them out dude before she burns your fucking house down", "Why live with a man that does not respect you or your home? Once he is out kari will have to be too.", "Jake has already told you his feelings and that he won\u2019t forgive if you make like \u201cit\u2019s not her home.\u201d It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s yours and she is a guest and guests take care and are respectful. So are people whose home it is. She is not acting like it\u2019s her home. She is acting like a vandal", "This is not something you easily move past.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even fundamentally about Kari.\n\nJake is being a bad husband and father and failing you both.  Kari needs to get a job or be in college, and learn how to be respectful, especially to someone giving here FREE HOUSING.  He is just enabling and teaching her bad behavior.\n\nAnd your his wife, and he is taking advantage of you and not respecting you.\n\nI would move on, but if you can\u2019t I\u2019d suggest a separation, let them live on their own and let Jake have to take care of Kari.  \n\nHonestly tho that, or any other step that could work, would likely lead to a break up.  I imagine they very much like the status quo and don\u2019t want changes. \n\nAnother suggestion.  A. Install cameras everywhere in case Kari breaks things.  B.  Lock up your dishes and food.  She can live there but until she cleans up after herself and contributes, no more free food and dishes.\n\nYour fully in your legal and moral right here, if install cameras and protect your valuables.  Someone who breaks literally every dish you have is probably not beyond stealing or breaking other things if they get angry.", "\u201cHoney she has broken x number of dishes. I\u2019m done both of you pack your stuff and go.\u201d", "Well here's the thing, when you were little and you dropped a glass or a plate and it broke, you thought, humm, they don't bounce.This hot mess of a young woman is doing it deliberately or she's high 24/7.", "And you can now see that a life with him will include all your stuff being ruined while he does nothing to stop it.", "Is this the life you hoped for?", "There is no fixing this. Kari is the way she is because she has shitty parents. Jake not forgiving you for kicking out his pwecious baby is the best thing that could happen to you. \n\nThis is just a preview of your life with him. Rehome both immediately before she destroys your home and not just your dishes.", "Kick him out. 21 is not a child and how he treats her now is how it will continue with you being disrespected forever", "Honey there\u2019s better men out there", "Please hear me. I lived this life. It was hell on earth. Run as fast as you can. Now. IT WILL NOT CHANGE!", "I think you would be better off without him.  This is a pre-cursor of what your life together will be like.  His daughter is deliberately destroying your things and he allowing it.  I am so sorry. But you need to have them both move out. You are deserving of respect in your own home.", "I feel for you and it\u2019s easy for us to say dump him and kick them both out. I am definitely not one who usually is quick to reach that verdict. But having just gone through a divorce I can say that it will only get worse from here. Marriage will make it exponentially worse. Please trust us on that at least. At a minimum, take a break (with neither living with you) to reevaluate. Treat yourself to a trip or some time with friends. Accept that the life you had imagined is NEVER going to happen. It sucks, it\u2019s not fair, but he\u2019s not the guy you thought he was. Don\u2019t hold onto him for the sake of a fantasy and end up wounding yourself on the shards in the process. Take care of yourself, internet stranger.", "Jake offered to move her in.  Interesting turn of phrase.", "Break up with him and kick them both out. Neither one of them respect you and it sounds like they both are counting on you to just enable all the behavior. If HE can\u2019t see that his ADULT daughter needs to be held accountable and be responsible, you aren\u2019t going to change anything by yourself.", "Newsflash, the AH daughter did not come to go to college, she came to make your life a living hell, and Daddy Dearest is enabling her. Kick them both out. You deserve better.", "Hell no.  So he is mooching off of you, and brought  his daughter to as well.  So she is not working, not going to college, and just living off of you\u2026. A.  He is a bad dad, B.  He is a bad fianc\u00e9 who is using you, C. His daughter is a bad person", "Dump them both. He moved her into YOUR home. It is NOT his house. He\u2019s enabling her bad behavior. And she\u2019s going to continue being a thorn in your side. He\u2019s a trash parent. Kick them both out and free yourself.", "\"She's a kid, give it some time\" gave me the same thought. Uh no, she may be your child, but that's a grown ass woman. \nIn fact, in 4 years time she will be the age her dad had her at.", "I was expecting either teen (OP n t a) or possibly the reverse with too high expectations for a 4yo (OP y t a) - the 21 makes this completely ridiculous.  This is a fianc\u00e9 problem as well, and I don\u2019t see the relationship lasting if he\u2019s tolerating this behavior from an adult child.", "And I've got some Ocean Front Property in Arizona I'd like to sell them... Great place for Rare Rock Collections \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc8e", "Nah he\u2019s just enabling her behavior and she sounds like an entitled brat. She knows EXACTLY what she\u2019s doing by giggling and saying \u201coops sorry\u201d she\u2019s 21 years old, hasn\u2019t gone to college, doesn\u2019t have a job, lives with her daddy, doesn\u2019t do her own laundry, her dad calls her \u201cjust a kid\u201d and doesn\u2019t clean her own room. She\u2019s a literal mooch and destroying OPs belongings. She isn\u2019t a child like her father thinks she is, it\u2019s OPs house so she has every right to kick them out and I would\u2019ve done so SEVERAL plates ago.\n\nFuck that- I\u2019m not a doormat but if you and OP wanna be doormats then go ahead. Have fun eating off the floor once she breaks your paper plates and spoons too", "Jake is her fianc\u00e9, not her husband. What OP should do is kick them both to the curb, because is enabling and supporting his daughter\u2019s terrible behaviour when it is obviously hurting OP.", "I wouldn\u2019t put it past someone like her to physically attack OP. Destruction of another\u2019s property in the home often is a precursor for physical violence. I can\u2019t believe OP is not entertaining getting rid of them both.", "She\u2019ll probably get pregnant soon to make things even better!", "And in your own damn house no less.", "Exactly. He doesn\u2019t even respect her enough to ask if kari can move in.
