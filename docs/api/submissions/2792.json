Brief statement to give you an idea about my parents;  They were nice people who should never had had children.  Physical, mental and emotionally abusive.  I went NC with them for 8 years.  In that time frame, my father had at least 3 heart attacks, and when I did, eventually reconnect, found out that they needed their children in far worse ways, and found out the hard way that none of us, (Me, my sister or brother) were able to be gotten in contact with and it knocked them way down to where they were unprepared.  I was the only one of the three, who endured it far longer and took the time to get back into a good mental state, that could and eventually did give a hand.  At the last part of their lives.  And I could tell that both of them had regretted what they had put their children through, as it was a bitter lesson for them.  \n\nCut them off and go NC, do it for yourself, do not invite them into any event, they will never change until they are way down and have hit rock bottom.", "Your father is verbally abusive.
