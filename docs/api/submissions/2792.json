He'd just wake up in a bad mood and start cussing us out. Never my mom though. He worships her.\n\nMom doesn't cuss us out but never calls dad out on his behavior either and she stays neutral which enables him. I've developed anxiety and depression due to his behavior, so has my brother and we both attend therapy for years.\n\nWe've moved out of their house and we live on our own. I live with my fianc\u00e9 and my brother lives with his friend. We barely have any contact with mom and dad anymore and they're wondering why.

Out of nowhere dad started cussing me out as a worthless cnt because I didn't serve my fianc\u00e9 a plate and he did it himself.\n\nHe kept going on about it and I kept ignoring him. Nobody called him out on his actions. Everyone just acted like what he did was normal. Mom also laughed at his insults. No consequences for his actions at all.\n\nAs he kept going I straight up told him \"if you keep acting like a cunt and an ass hole I'll have no choice but to leave because I'm tired of you\". That's what I said. And chaos broke through. Everyone. Literally everyone suddenly remembered to call me out for daring to speak to my dad like that, my dad who made sacrifices to raise me. I was called ungrateful, spoilt, lacking manners etc by the entire family except my brother and a couple of cousins who sided with me.\n\nI then left with my fianc\u00e9 and brother. People kept bombarding me with texts and calls about how I should apologise not just to my dad but to the entire family for being so disrespectful and even if my dad was wrong, I escalated it by insulting him back instead of being the bigger person.
