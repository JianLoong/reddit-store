Growing up our dad would always call us the worst cuss words possible. I've been called an AH, worthless, whore, I've been told to go to hell and other stuff like that. All that over nothing. He'd just wake up in a bad mood and start cussing us out. Never my mom though. He worships her.\n\nMom doesn't cuss us out but never calls dad out on his behavior either and she stays neutral which enables him. I've developed anxiety and depression due to his behavior, so has my brother and we both attend therapy for years.\n\nWe've moved out of their house and we live on our own. I live with my fianc\u00e9 and my brother lives with his friend. We barely have any contact with mom and dad anymore and they're wondering why. We've made it clear multiple times how their actions have hurt us and driven us away but still insist to have no clue.\n\nAnyway flash forward to a couple days ago when we had a family reunion with multiple cousins, aunt's, uncles etc. That was at my aunt's house, my dad's sister. Out of nowhere dad started cussing me out as a worthless cnt because I didn't serve my fianc\u00e9 a plate and he did it himself.\n\nHe kept going on about it and I kept ignoring him. Nobody called him out on his actions. Everyone just acted like what he did was normal. Mom also laughed at his insults. No consequences for his actions at all.\n\nAs he kept going I straight up told him \"if you keep acting like a cunt and an ass hole I'll have no choice but to leave because I'm tired of you\". That's what I said. And chaos broke through. Everyone. Literally everyone suddenly remembered to call me out for daring to speak to my dad like that, my dad who made sacrifices to raise me. I was called ungrateful, spoilt, lacking manners etc by the entire family except my brother and a couple of cousins who sided with me.\n\nI then left with my fianc\u00e9 and brother. People kept bombarding me with texts and calls about how I should apologise not just to my dad but to the entire family for being so disrespectful and even if my dad was wrong, I escalated it by insulting him back instead of being the bigger person.

I'm sorry to hear this! I am wondering, though, if your fiance was quiet while your dad was insulting you about not bringing him a plate? Weird that your fiance would just sit back and let this happen; especially if its because your fiance got his own plate of food. \n\nAlthough maybe not in front of everyone at a family gathering may not be the best place to shout profanities, etc, I personally don't think you TA for speaking up for yourself. Especially if no one else was going to step up and doing it. You don't deserve to be treated or spoken to like that. And I can't believe your family blamed you and told you, YOU should apologize. And what were you supposed to do? Good for you for breaking the cycle of abuse and not letting him bully you. Don't let your family make you feel like you have to apologize for sticking up for yourself and not taking the undeserved abuse.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations!

People should be telling them how to act.  All this it's your dad or mom you gotta put up with it blah blah blah is complete and utter shit.  My advice to you is fuck them.

I do believe you should apologise to other family but not your dad.

So your dad doing it isn't a you problem.", "I didn't even fully know they were enablers.

That's just disgusting. And your mother didn't say anything? That's even more disgusting. That's plain mental abuse. The fact that there are no physical damage doesn't change the fact, that he abused you and your brother and your mother never reacted. I am so sorry, that you had to go through this.", "I hope they picked out nice nursing homes that you won\u2019t visit!", "I am truly sorry that you had to go through this. No child should ever have to endure that kind of treatment. You should have been built up, supported, and encouraged, not criticized and torn down. \n\nThat said, as an adult you get to choose your path. \"I will not be speaking to you until you can treat me with respect.  Let me know when you can do that\" allows you to take the high road, and it sets a clear boundary. At gatherings, you can simply ignore his words and walk away, at least until (or if) he decides to value you enough to treat you respectfully."]}
