I've been in Leah's life since she was 9. While her biological mother is in her life, in practise I'm her mum. While it was initially rough (she was not happy about her dad dating ), she quickly calmed down and accepted us. She's still a cheeky smart arse, but we're all close and she definitely loves us.\n\nMy family has an heirloom necklace that is passed down to the eldest daughter. In the lead up to Leah's birthday my husband asked about the necklace. Apparently Leah had mentioned it, and he was curious what I was planning. Honestly I'd never considered whether it would go to Leah or Sienna. My first instinct was Sienna, but the more I thought about it the more I realised that felt wrong. Leah's the oldest and just as much my daughter. I'd always told her blood doesn't matter and we're really close. While Sienna knows the tradition, I've never promised it to her and rarely brought it up in general. So I decided to give it to Leah on her birthday. She was surprised but was so happy and grateful. \n\nIt felt like I made the right choice. But my family and, later, Sienna were furious. They think it should have gone to her. That a family heirloom should go to my biological daughter. My mother claims I'm betraying it's meaning, that I'm throwing everything away. \n\nI don't agree with them. Obviously my husband supports whatever decision I make, but that's a given. But mother is the one who gave it to me, and thinks it's a mistake. Despite everything I'm worried I'm making a mistake even if I feel it's the right thing to do.\n\nEdit.

If you wanted to include your stepdaughter in such a manner , why not have a replica made of the heirloom , that way the original goes to your daughter ,but you still include your stepdaughter.\n\nIt would be just as strong of a statement, many even more so. A symbol that they are sisters, and that you see her as your daughter without risking any upset.", "YTA\n\nThe heirloom should have gone to your bio kid. If you wanted your step child to feel included and special you could have gone out and gotten her her OWN special necklace that she can then pass down to her own bio kids. Start a new heirloom chain of her own which would have had all the sentimental value of the one you gave to your step child and probably more.", "NTA it\u2019s yours to give whoever you want", "YTA. Omg. If I was your daughter, I would never look at you the same way again. Why are you punishing her??", "YTA", "wow\u2026 ppl saying \u201csoft\u201d YTA. nah. you are very much so the asshole.", "Yta.", "NAH\n\nFamily heirloms are muddy water in this kind of cases. You had every right to give this necklace to your step-daughter as this necklace was given to you, but int his case your family have every right to be pissed / disagree with that decision, as this is family heirloom. \n\nAnd for people making cases about OP divorcing Leah father - ffs, bio families split too, with tons of bad blood inbetween.", "NAH. If you feel that Leah is your daughter (and thus your eldest) then she is your eldest. However, since an heirloom is all about keeping something in the *family* for generations, maybe offer to adopt her officially if she is open to it *in the future?* That way it is \"in the family\" in more than just feelings? I also understand the anger the rest of the family is having. An family heirloom that has been in the family for (how long?) was given to someone they do not see as family, so they feel like generations of tradition are being ignored when the \"rightful\" inheritor is right there.", "Honestly I feel like this is NAH. \n\nYou consider Leah your oldest daughter and so gave her the heirloom.\n\nLeah didn't expect the heirloom but was happy to receive it.\n\nYour mum was the one who gave you the heirloom and expected you to pass it on to her biological granddaughter and is upset that didn't happen.\n\nSienna is upset she missed out on a family heirloom because her step daughter happens to be older than her. It's not the same as having an older bio sister because then Sienna and the extended family would have always expected the older sister to get it. To them this feels like something being taken away. It doesn't really mean anything that Sienna seemed OK with it at first either, she may have felt like she had to hide her feelings to not be called spoilt or selfish but then the extended family validated her feelings and made her feel safe saying them out loud.\n\nNone of the above seem unreasonable and I can understand all of them.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight it seems you could have made everyone happy by starting a new heirloom tradition with Sienna and a heartfelt letter about how she is your oldest daughter and so now you want to start a new heirloom with her regardless of biological relationship. But you couldn't have known that at the time and its easy to say that now.\n\nWhat's done is done, I dont think you can change it without making things worse so I guess you just have to let time heal.\n\nI'm not sure if starting a new heirloom with Sienna when she's 20 would have the same effect though, you'd have to use your own judgement at the time. It might feel like reopening a wound depending on Sienna's outlook.", "I don't know what judgement to give. It's awesome that you love and accept your step daughter so much but if I were your younger daughter this would have probably severely affected me. Made me feel like the second choice and would affect my relationship with both my parents and sister. Anyway I'll go with soft YTA", "YTA\n\nYou've not only gone against your families wishes for a family heirloom, but you've pretty much guaranteed that your daughter will not only take issue with her step-sister but you as well.\n\nIt's quite obvious that you favor your step-daughter over your own daughter. When your step-daughter decides that her actual mother is her mother and not you, you will regret that you screwed up your relationship with your daughter. Hopefully your daughter ends up with a nice mother-in-law so she can have a mother too.", "Soft YTA\n\nI think its amazing that you and Leah has formed such a strong bond. There should also have been a conversation with Sienna way beforehand. I dont think its odd for her to assume that the heirloom from her grandmother would go to her, especially considering that your mom thought it should as well. Not having a conversation with her about it before hand is what makes you the AH in this situation to me. You could have talked with Sienna, figuring it out together, hearing out her side, explaining yours, see if there is a happy medium, but instead it seems like you might have blindsided her about something she thought would be hers, making her feel less than Leah.\n\nIts great that you have the relationship you have with Leah. In making her feel included by giving the eldest sister the necklace, you also forgot about Sienna and how this would make her feel. A conversation with her beforehand could have solved this, but it didnt seem that Sienna and how she could possibly feel about this crossed your mind at all.", "NTA. As you put it Leah is as much a daughter as Sienna. If your mom doesn\u2019t like it tough tits; it\u2019s not up to her to decide who\u2019s family. Would she also be mad if you adopted a little girl before Sienna? I think other family just has to deal and move on, the only person you should sit and talk with is Sienna. Try and have her understand where you\u2019re coming from and break the weird stigma that\u2019s around Step, Half, & Adopted kin. In the end family is what you make of it and honestly I think giving it to Leah shows much stronger family values because it really does go deeper than blood.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m baffled by the amount of people saying YTA and calling Leah \u201cnot your real daughter\u201d folks are just heartless. Also it\u2019s just silly that some think you\u2019ve completely ruined your 16 year relationship with Sienna over this one thing. They put so much emphasis on her being \u201cyour real daughter\u201d and yet at the same time think your relationship is so fragile as to be crushed so easily. I\u2019m truly bewildered.", "NAH. This was always going to be a no win situation, as one side was bound to be upset by your decision.", "YTA. Leah now has two mothers, Sienna has one. It is Sienna's family that passed down that heirloom and it was expected to go to Sienna and if Sienna has a daughter in the future it would go to her daughter.  I'm curious if your husband would pass down an heirloom from his side of the family to Sienna. I'm guessing the answer is \"no\".\n\nYou also should have talked to Sienna about this ahead of time since this is her family heirloom.", "YTA.\n\nSure it's your heirloom and you choose who it goes to, but that doesn't mean you're any less responsible for the hurt your decision has caused.\n\nSienna was born as your firstborn and it was like that for five years. I get that 5yr old Sienna didn't understand the tradition of the necklace at the time, but that doesn't change the fact that you displaced her position and have taken away something she was originally owed all because you happened to marry someone with an elder child.\n\nI think you knew how deeply it would hurt Sienna which was also evinced by Leah's surprise. Even Leah didn't expect to receive it. The right way to do this would have been to commission something similar for Leah and explain that you love her just as equally as Sienna and although you now think of her as your eldest daughter, you wouldn't feel right taking away something that originally was intended for Sienna.\n\nInstead you've caused a deep rift not only between you and Sienna, but Sienna and Leah. Sienna will never get over this and I don't blame her. How thoughtless of you to ruin the relationship between sisters just to prove you're such a great stepmother.\n\nHonestly you've betrayed both girls- you've deprived Sienna of her mother and deprived Leah of her sister.", "yta\n\nsorry but you gave it to a step daughter , not your daughter who has know about this since she was little and you didnt even say or ask before hand \n\nno sorry but you have made a mistake by not asking and talking to your daughter about it", "Yta", "Yeah.... Without even talking with your mom or your bio daughter. YTA. You've created unneeded and unnecessary rift and resentment between your daughters and other family members and thrown away the family tradition. \n\nThis kind of hurt will not be done right aside talking with the step daughter and trying to fix the situation. \n\nThat said, this proves family heirlooms are as meaningful as their latest owner. And I have a personal story about it. \n\nMy father's mother gave me as, a 8-tear old, a family ring. I accidentally lost it.when she heard if it, she \"accidentally\" broke my mother's mother's family gift of sugar and milk containers that were in my mother's possession, also a family heirloom. I believe she did that intentionally out of resentment. \n\nI've always felt super bad for the ring and the containers, but I was so proud of it that I carried it everywhere and it was too large to stay in my small finger.", "NTA - as a step child, who holds no blame in the break down of parental relationships, you are so often made to feel like a second class citizen, like less than \u201cthe real kids\u201d. I wish my own step parents had seen and treated me as their own like you have here. I commend you for seeing and treating Leah as your own child and I think lots of step parents could well take a lesson from you.", "Well I agree with your mother but it is your choice and for good reason. However I think your decision--whoever it was l--should not have been a sudden surprise to your daughters, so for that I think YTA.", "But but but\u2026 *leah was so happy so I know I made the right decision even though sienna was heartbroken*", "yta", "Yta\n\nSienna was around first, just because your stepdaughter came along later in life and you consider her your older daughter, that heirloom wasn't meant for her. That necklace was Sienna's the moment she was born, as your first\\*born\\* daughter.   \n\n\nAs for wanting to fix what you fucked up, good luck on that, because if I was in Sienna's shoes, I'd resent you for the foreseeable future because giving your stepdaughter a necklace that she had no claim to. Have fun with a bio daughter that resents you and the lost trust she has in you/", "Yta. Why would you do that? Who is your first born? Whose birth certificate are you on? Who you parents saw as your first born? Who is their first grand child?  I hope your parents now at least have a strong will, knowing who you are going to favour with their inheritance. If you get divorced and have a new partner with much older kid. Are you going to take the necklace back from Leah and give it to the new kid?\nLeah gets from her  own mom, dad, and step mom. Sienna gets only from her dad and grandparents. Because her mom is biased and does give a preferential treatment.", "YTA. Did you ever consider trying to turn the necklace into two pieces or starting a new tradition with your stepdaughter?", "NTA\n\nThe only thing I'd possibly say was handled incorrectly, if my assumptions are right, is that maybe talking to your youngest daughter about your choice beforehand. Not because you need permission, or that you need her acceptance, but simply so she understands your logic. (I've often found that adults making decisions without explaining the reasoning is a big issue for children/young adults. A lot of resentment and confusion can stem from this as our processing and life experience are widely different)\n\nBottom line is though, BOTH of them are your daughter's and your family can keep their opinions to themselves. As many of us have experienced first hand, blood families are usually the type who feel entitled to comment and pass judgement, and are often the people who cause us the most harm. (Intentional or not.)  You know your family unit best, don't allow others to spin the narrative to suit them and their opinions.", "Soft YTA just because it seems you didn\u2019t fully consider Siennas feelings. Is it possible to recreate the necklace or get one that compliments the heirloom to make a new tradition?", "NTA\n\nBlood doesn\u2019t always make a family", "YTA. Are there any other heirlooms that your bio daughter can have? Maybe something from your husbands mother? Would she be willing to give up something so sentimental to a step kid?", "NTA.\n\nThis is a tough one. You meant well and it is obvious you consider Leah as your own. However, this has highlighted a tension in the family with both Leah and Sienna being more questioning around biological and step parents. For Leah, the surprise she showed upon receiving the necklace and obviously, Sienna's subsequent reaction could be indications of this.\n\nThis makes me think that perhaps Leah and Sienna's respective fears have never been addressed as such (or a conversation around expactations and relationships with biological and step parents/siblings/families) which is why the necklace held so much significance for the both of them, though in different ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Heirlooms need clear, structured rules in wills. How are you worried about making a mistake, yet feel like it's the right thing to do? Sienna learns not to depend on others, a lesson for you on preparation and communication, and for Leah, your love. Your mistake? Ruining your relationship with your daughter, ignoring Leah's biological mom's presence in her life, and seeking validation as her bonus mom. You have also probably made things weird between the girls. Leah has her mom, and Sienna has hers. We can have motherly figures, but if Leah needs something, she'd turn to her mother. Your husband's support is flawed; Sienna and your family are furious. Blood doesn't define family, and two daughters exist, but you should have known better.

Leah already has a mother with whom she can share traditions like this. Sienna only has you. Ultimately, it was yours to give, or do whatever with really, but if the tradition was important to you, you might have checked in with the women who made you a part of it before you gave it to Leah, who wasn't expecting to get it anyway. Your relatives have planted the seed that Sienna should feel hurt and angry, and so she will.

However, while she is older, she is not your first daughter, your youngest was already born when you met her, she got pushed out of the line, she basically inherited it when she was born and its been taken off of her, so not about biology so much as first come first serve, and your youngest got there first. Also i cant help but think that your husband's even asking about it was out of line, it wasnt really his place to do that\n\n**Edit:** cannot stress enough though, while i think YTA, because your youngest was there first, people in the comments arguing that shes \"not your real daughter\" and that your mother should have any say in it are well out of line, thats a pretty gross attitude to have actually", "YTA- Leah has a mother to share these things with.

My husband's family has a large farm, in another state, that comes down through his grandparent's family. Grandma gave each of her children a portion of the acreage, to be handed down to her grandchildren one day. My FIL died unexpectedly, and MIL got everything. She knew that the property was intended for my husband and his sister, but legally, in our state, it was 'her' property. She ran into money trouble, and decided to sell the property - never told us about anything, nor even gave us a chance to 'buy' his inheritance property! We found out afterwards, when a very angry grandma told us it was gone. My point is that while it may be 'legally' yours, it is still a *family* heirloom and the family member that passed it down is alive and able to tell you their wishes for their family's tradition - *morally* speaking, this was not *entirely* your decision to make - you should have had a bigger conversation with your mother and your daughter about this! At a minimum, you should have given them a head's up and a chance to share their POV, which was also an opportunity for you to mitigate the damage to the people that you love.

I'd sit Sienna down and explain to her that while you understand she might be disappointed, you are very much carrying on the tradition since Leah is your eldest daughter. Since Sienna's only 16 I'd maybe see if you can get her another gift she's been wanting to help soften the blow if she's very disappointed.
