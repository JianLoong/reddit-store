{"id": 9291, "submission_id": "10v82lq", "title": "AITA for putting up sticky notes in the bathroom for my brother to flush the toilet?", "selftext": "I(f18) have been in a bit of an argument with my brother(16). I have a mediocre relationship with my brother, we don't hate each other and get along quite well, but it does get a bit strained at times. He spends most of his time in his room playing video games and doesn't really help me or my mother around the house often unless asked specifically.\n\nThis has never been an issue in the past, but about 2 weeks ago I noticed a turd floating in the toilet. We have two toilets, but the other is at the other end of the house and I only really use it when I'm on my period, since my brother says \"He doesn't want my period on the toilet seat\". I flushed it down, not thinking much of it. 3 days later the same thing happened again, a turd floating in the toilet. This time I just politely asked him to flush the toilet properly next time. He told me it mustn't have flushed properly, so I took his word and left the situation alone.\n\n4 days later it happened again, this time the water was brown and disgusting, I went to tell him to please flush the toilet properly, a bit more sternly this time. He gave the same excuse again, I insisted and left the situation alone. The next day it happened again, I decided to ask my mother to talk to him about flushing the toilet properly, to which she said that he mustn't have wanted to cause too much noise since it was night.\n\nI told her I understood, but I am a heavy sleeper and I also just don't want to have to flush other people's shits down the toilet. She said she would talk to him, but never did.\n\nIt happened 3 days in a row. I figured enough was enough. I decided to leave a sticky note on the door saying 'Please flush the toilet'. It was almost immediately taken down and obviously flushed down the toilet but my brother. I put one up again to sell the message that I will do it if he keeps on leaving his shit floating in the toilet. He came into my room and yelled at me for leaving sticky notes, to which I said that there wasn't much else I could do. He wasn't listening to me at all and my mother wasn't doing anything. He accused me of treating him like a baby, to which I said that I will continue to treat him like one if he doesn't flush the toilet.\n\nMy mother told me that I was being condescending and rude to my brother, that I didn't understand. I get that sometimes toilets don't flush properly, but 3 days in a row was ridiculous and I was getting fed up with getting treated by his turds in the toilet and having to flush them down, especially when the water was brown. \n\nI don't know though, maybe the notes were condescending. It's been two days since it has happened, but was I overreacting or took it top far?
