I don't care who's wedding it is, there are limits and boundaries not to be crossed. You should never allow anyone try to push you to be something that you're not.

I do think you should maybe give best friend a clearer idea of your reasons though. Yes, you told him fiancee is making you uncomfortable, but if he doesn't know about the interactions you've had with her he can't be expected to understand what is happening. Plus, if someone has a NB bestie, it's likely he wouldn't approve of fianc\u00e9es actions and will be more supportive of your side of things. Wedding stress is not the reason for the fianc\u00e9es comments. No amount of stress can force someone to be dismissive and insulting of your gender or sexuality, and the remarks that she made were entirely by choice. Whilst you have no obligation to explain yourself to anyone, personally, I would inform your friend about what has happened as I feel he deserves to know the kind of person he is with.", "NAH.
