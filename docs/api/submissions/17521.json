I don't care who's wedding it is, there are limits and boundaries not to be crossed. You should never allow anyone try to push you to be something that you're not.

I do think you should maybe give best friend a clearer idea of your reasons though. Yes, you told him fiancee is making you uncomfortable, but if he doesn't know about the interactions you've had with her he can't be expected to understand what is happening. Plus, if someone has a NB bestie, it's likely he wouldn't approve of fianc\u00e9es actions and will be more supportive of your side of things. Wedding stress is not the reason for the fianc\u00e9es comments. No amount of stress can force someone to be dismissive and insulting of your gender or sexuality, and the remarks that she made were entirely by choice. Whilst you have no obligation to explain yourself to anyone, personally, I would inform your friend about what has happened as I feel he deserves to know the kind of person he is with.", "NAH.

You are HIS friend, not hers.\n\nHe asked you to be his grooms person.\n\nIfyou wanted to be in the wedding party, why didn\u2019t you just say yes? It\u2019s his problem if he has six other groomsmen. Or maybe he thinks having seven is cool.\n\nHim shoving you onto his fianc\u00e9e is not on.\n\nShe is not your friend, you are not her friend.\n\nShes out of her depth with understanding nb, and she doesn\u2019t deserve to be crucified for that.\n\nIn her brides head, she sees how she wants her bridesmaids to look, and that\u2019s her right.\n\nJust be the bigger person and be a guest at the wedding.\n\nAfter all this fuss, you are right, you will probably lose him as a friend.\n\nThere was no need for any of this drama.\n\nWhen he asked you, you could have said Yes. You didn\u2019t. That should have made you \u2018just a guest\u2019 by default, like anyone else he may have asked who declined.", "wait isn\u2019t op NB?", "Yeah, I agree. I think it was sort of rude to insist on who the best friend chose to stand up with him, so slight YTA there but NTA for the fiance interactions.", "They didn't say no though. They said to offer it to the brothers first. I'm guessing all 6 brothers accepted and they needed to pad the brides side a bit. \n\n\nThat being said, I think there are ways to have unequal #s in the bride / groom wedding party and it still look normal", "Fianc\u00e9 was being a bigot to OP plain and simple. And I can\u2019t quite understand what you wanted to change about OP\u2019s response to that. Are you saying they should\u2019ve put up with it because the wedding \u201cisn\u2019t about them\u201d or something just as ridiculous?", "The examples are just for metaphor purposes - it'd be just as weird for the bride to request that of anyone else.", "You won't be the reason. Her actions will be. You're just caught in the middle.", "Omg you have to tell them. Don't let your friend marry a person they don't know.", "If I were in his position I would want to know that my fianc\u00e9 was being transphobic and homophobic to my best friend.", "Where is the OP micromanaging anything?"]}
