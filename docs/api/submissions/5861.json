If she\u2019s good with your daughter, that\u2019s enough for her to start with.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for your response to her because she was baiting you in a jokey way and you had no concept of knowing what was actually happening.", "YTA.

It wasn't your place to decide if she would be a good mom or not.", "YTA - you made the classic mistake of insulting a person after they self-insulted them. \nShe was expecting a: well, I always thought I'd be an awful mother too, but if I can manage, so can you. \nOr a: No, you would be a good mother\nYou decided on insult after self-insult, that makes you the asshole. Apologize and remember for the future, the comment to a self-insult is either encouragement or a self-insult of your own.", "NTA for the title question. Outside of that??

Talking shit about yourself so that other people compliment you is manipulative and shady. Especially since Katie has previously said that she didn't want children! If you need reassurance from a friend (or someone you look up to, such as a friend's older sister), **ask for it**. You're 25.

You seem jealous of Katie and manipulative.  Yta", "YTA. Your reasons on why she would make a bad parent aren't indicative of bad parenting. Many good parents have those qualities. They just adopt a parenting style that uses their strengths instead.\n\nPersonally I hate when people say one thing looking to hear another. But this doesn't seem to be fishing for compliments. What she said came off more like it was self doubt that she felt comfortable enough expressing it to you.", "YTA \n\nGiven she's 25 I would dismiss her past comments about her being a mother as not being emotionally mature enough yet. \n\nYou don't have to agree with peoples lowest opinions of themselves and if you do you shouldn't take it further. Acceptable agreement \"it would be an adventure\" unacceptable  \"it would be awful\"", "YTA, that's not a nice thing to say at all.. You say you were joking but then you have listed here many ways that you feel she wouldnt be a good mother.. Its also really odd that you trust her to take care of your daughter but claim she wouldnt be a good mother\n\nAre you jealous or something?

I guess it might be the way I joke with my friends but we double down on each other \"insecurities\". \n\nIf she was fishing for reassurance, she should have been direct about it.

You're reinforcing something negative.\n\nLike, for example, your comment sent her internally from \"What if I'm gonna be an awful parent?\" to \"It's true, I really am going to an awful parent\"", "YTA and this goes much deeper than just agreeing with her. That \u201cnot judging\u201d parenthesis is exactly you judging, or allowing the people in this sub to judge her for taking him back, else you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. \nAll these relationships are a bit convoluted and I wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain them the way Katie does, but that\u2019s her choice. Why is she good enough to care for your daughter but not good enough to care for her own child? Why not reiterate to your friend that Daniel is as bad as you make him seem? Is Katie really your friend?", "I think it's impossible to know how someone will be as a parent. It's weird to agree with someone that they'd be an 'awful' parent when you're saying they show great qualities without child. Don't all new parents have those moments that they'll be a terrible parent?!\n\nI don't want children, but my friends and family wouldn't dream of saying what you said to your friend to me.

Makes it sound even more like you're really just bitter he went back to her.", "YTA. You are being very very harsh and judgmental. \n\nShe sounds like she will be a great mom. You just said that she has always been super reliable and she teaches your daughter cool things and your daughter listens to her.\n\nNewsflash you shouldn\u2019t be so judgmental no one has to be perfect to be a parent", "NTA.

If she was feeling unsure and needed support, she should have been more upfront about it.\n\nClassic case of play stupid games win stupid prices.", "NTA Frankly, people who play games and \"joke\" while fishing for reassurance or compliments have only themselves to blame if it blows up in their face. You returned what you thought was her energy in a joking manner, unaware of her real motivation or her pregnancy. That's on her, not you.", "What a bizarre thing for a pregnant person to say to you.\n\nPresumably she wanted you to be all \"mo you'd be an amazing mommy\"\n\nAh well.  NTA.", "YTA. She was clearly being insecure, and most people are shitty mom's at 25. You should have been kinder.", "NTA\n\nOP was baited into a non-serious, joking conversation and then got hit by insecurities disguised as a self-deprecating joke, instead of a simple request for advice. This is made worse by the fact that OP did not know of the pregnancy. There was no way for her to deduce that this was not a harmless joke between the two of them but a very, very poorly structured attempt at getting her help. This could have all been avoided by \"hey. can we talk? I need your advice\".\n\nIf advice was never the intent, but Katie was fishing for compliments and reassuring, this turns an even uglier shade. But still zero fault for OP.\n\nAlso, ppl in comments really want their jealousy movie drama to be a thing here, but it isn't. The dude has nothing to do with this specific situation, except that he should educate himself about condoms. Those of you trying to construct some malicious triangle here... go write a book.", "YTA I make the same jokes with my friends but something you should always add at the end of those jokes even as a courtesy is \"but nah really I think you'd be a great mother\"", "This a mess YTA", "NTA\n\nKatie has pregnancy brain.

I don\u2019t think YTA because I think you were being lighthearted.  She\u2019s sort of an AH for baiting that response from you tbh, but not really.  Let\u2019s give her the pregnancy hormone pass for today.  Nobody is an AH and everybody is / will be a fabulous mother!", "nah\n\nim guessing when you responded you weren\u2019t thinking too hard about the scenario, just agreeing with her to continue the conversation. her reaction is also justified in its own way. daniel may be a slight asshole for getting upset with you for this but it could also just be a slight misunderstanding(maybe he thought you said that unprovoked?) and really only was defending his girlfriend. \n\ni think the best way to fix this is reiterate that you weren\u2019t thinking too hard and was just trying to continue the conversation, and reassure her about her good qualities! remind her how good she is with your daughter, and let her know that whether or not she decides to go through with her pregnancy should be up to her, not because of something you said. ultimately its her choice, but let her know that you weren\u2019t really thinking too hard about the scenario and that you\u2019ll be supportive no matter what she decides.", "YTA", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who plans on never having kids, the whole \"but you'd be a good mom\" is fucking annoying. Like, maybe I'd be, but it feels condescending. It's sort of better when people answer with someone who is \"oh, I can see why you feel like that\".\n\nWhat I'm saying is feel free to blame me on continuing the joke, as for some child free people it's the better answer.\n\nLike, how were you supposed to know she was pregnant and seeking reassurance instead of joking around?\n\nThat being said, if you sort of coparent with her, it's in your kid's best interest to have a good relationship with her. Maybe make her a gift for her baby and tell her that the fact that she's worried about being a good mom shows that she's on the right path? That she's good with your kid and that if she ever needs some mom-to-mom moments you'd be there for her?\n\nI know some people might feel she should be the one to apologize or something, but if she's nice to your kid I'd be interested in keeping that going.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
