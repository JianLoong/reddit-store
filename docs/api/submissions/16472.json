I'm his aunt and I love him but I really can't have him around for long. The last time he was in our house he poured my nailpolish collection onto my wife's favourite silk Persian carpet. And that isn't even 1% of the damage he has done. \n\nMy wife (27F) and I recently bought a villa out of town. It has a game room, pool, and many things Bella adores. So we offered to give her a tour of the place and let her check out the rose garden there, if Alex and his wife agreed. \n\nAlex said either both Michael and Bella were to be included or none of them were going. My wife and I both insisted to only take Bella but he was not having it so we said we would just go by ourselves. \n\nAlex got really mad at us and said it was disgusting that we favored Bella because she was a girl and that we were both hypocritical and unfair to Michael, and never included him in our plans. \n\nI told my brother that Michael was an uncontrollable kid. He had the audacity to ask what Michael had done. I told him I'd let him know (I've told him the items over the years as it happened but he always said it was an accident and that Michael's a boy and boys play rough). I made a table including every item my nephew damages in our house and the estimated cost. \n\nIt included a few of my wife's antique vases, her glass statue of the Eiffel tower, carpet, several of my wife's crystal decorative items and two phones (he flushed them down the toilet). Even the mirror of my car. I sent the list to Alex.\n\nHe is now extremely angry with me, and thinks I am being an arrogant person, and taking after my wife's trait of being an uptight rich kid.

This is more of an actions have consequences situation. While it might feel unfair to Michael, this is the opportunity for his parents to teach him to behave better in other people's homes. I also don't think it would be fair for the niece to be denied things due to her brothers behaviour. \n\n\nAlso, people need to be more realistic in life.

Especially when said child is destroying your property. \n\nChildren that grow up without consequences struggle as adults in society.\n\n**Edit I am in no way trying to imply that they are CF or have chosen to be permanently CF. What I should have said was: \n  It sounds like you have a CF home, you are in no way obligated to childproof or make your home \"child friendly.\" It is the responsibility of the parents to teach their children how to behave in someone else's home. Having nice things that one wouldn't (typically) find in a home with children doesn't make you materialistic. \n\nIt was simply an observation that I felt might provide insight into the headspace of the child's father.", "NTA. Also, that is not typical behavior to just be destroying peoples stuff all the time even for a boy. What a ridiculous statement. Has your brother ever paid for the items or replaced them? I imagine no. So what if he destroyed items at someone who isn\u2019t family? Can they afford to replace those items? They need to figure that out because they are really setting him up for failure. As for hanging out with Bella alone I totally get the impulse. But I was a kid that was not favored because because I was no longer the youngest anymore. I\u2019d just go low contact with that side until they address his behavior appropriately.

He could be feeling jealous if he feels he is looked over a bit when he is with his sister when they visit your home.

Until there is a significant change in his behaviour over a period of time, I can't let someone who has a pattern of deliberately and maliciously vandalising our property into our home. This isn't normal 10 yr old behaviour so his age is no excuse. This isn't typical \"boys being boys\" behaviour so that isn't an excuse either. \"\n\nNTA what is going on with Micheal? Is your brother homophobic and teaching him to do this to you deliberately?", "NTA, if someone\u2019s kid ruins your stuff that person should replace the destroyed item. No questions asked. \n\nMy concern for your nephew is worth noting. Michael is being allowed to act inappropriately by his parents (or maybe just your brother?) and THAT is also favouring one child over the other. They are allowing him to act poorly because \u201cboys will be boys\u201d so they are enabling that nonsense. Beyond that though, have they had Michael assessed for ADHD, behavioural issues etc? There might be something there to find that could help him. I worry about the language Michael might be hearing as well. Saying he is \u201cuncontrollable\u201d is saying he is \u201cbad\u201d and I highly doubt he is unaware of your feelings and I also highly doubt you\u2019re the only people who\u2019ve said such things about/to him. This can be very damaging for a child. And while his *behaviour* is not good, there is most definitely a reason for it that his parents haven\u2019t unearthed. \n\nHonestly his parents are the A H in every sense here. To you (and anyone else who has damaged property from their son). But most importantly to their own kids. 1. To Michael because they are failing him by not getting to the source of his behaviour and making it better for him, and 2. To Bella as she most definitely sees and feels the inequities in how she and Michael are treated", "NTA for sending the list.\n\nI do believe you could have handled the situation differently, by letting him know of what was going on before you dump a list on him (which he did ask for, so no issues there).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't want to make too many assumptions here, but I can't help but make some given that the OP can only provide so much info.  But reading that, I have to assume that you're fairly affluent for your area.  You and your SO are purchasing property in your mid-20s, and not only that but property with a pool, many luxury items (silk rugs, expensive vases, electronics), and other indicators of a good deal of wealth (a game room, a rose garden).  That isn't to say wealth is bad or that you need to feel bad for having it, but my question to you is: what exactly do you expect your niblings to do when they visit that would not be potentially hazardous to your numerous expensive possessions?  \n\nIt sounds like every corner of your home is chock full of expensive things, and while I can't condone or excuse the behavior of your nephew (and by extension the parenting of your brother), I also have some real questions about whether or not your home is prepared to have kids visit, and in particular have kids be unsupervised during a visit.  I would certainly hope a 10-year-old child would be mature enough to not deliberately pour nail polish on a carpet or to throw a phone in the toilet, but I also think it's unrealistic to expect them to sit quietly in the corner not touching anything for hours straight.\n\nMy advice to you is that you need a better strategy to handle your niblings when they come over to visit.  Maybe you convert a room in your house to a more kid-friendly play area (e.g. a finished basement area) that doesn't have anything expensive in it.  Maybe you say that any visits from the niblings are going to be restricted to pool area/backyard, and you only invite them over during good weather for patio parties.  Maybe you just put anything expensive and fragile into storage while your niblings visit.  Your brother should also be better about reining in his kids, but trying to convince anyone that they aren't doing well enough as a parent is not a conversation that is liable to go well.  But you're better off trying to control your own actions and environment than your brother's actions.", "nta", "NTA I hate it when people say it because he is a boy.

It's one thing to be messy or even throw things and break them when you're mad, but purposely unscrewing a bunch of tiny little bottles and dumping the contents out one by one is a really malicious act that took time and patience (or it's not malicious and the kid is developmentally below his age - my toddler might do something like that).", "I'm also ADHD, and was considered developmentally disabled throughout elementary school, and I would NEVER have deliberately broken or destroyed something that wasn't mine just because I needed more stimulation at that age.

Sure, but don't pretend that letting a glop of paint end up on the carpet, or knocking a glass off the counter while reaching carelessly for candy is the same as FLUSHING PHONES DOWN THE TOILET.

When he asks about it later, he's reminded (gently) that he broke it and it's gone forever. That's when the lesson really sticks. \n\nLo and behold, his destructiveness has decreased substantially.
