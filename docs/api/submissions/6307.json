Ofc I don\u2019t mind avoiding the subject around her, but she wanted to stop us from doing stuff like meal prep or counting calories bc it\u2019s all \"diet culture.\" I have a food scale bc I\u2019m shit at portion sizes and she wanted me to \u201cput it up.\u201d\n\nI gained some weight over the last semester due to laziness and snacking, and I need to get myself back into shape, and I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m doing something \u201cwrong\u201d trying to love myself and my body.\n\nMads is with me, so the two of us decided to propose that we just have Liv switch rooms. Liv got really upset and said that she was really hurt that I would choose \u201cdiet culture\u201d over living with her. I said that I don\u2019t want to hurt her, but that me getting back into shape is important, and that I also think having me and Mads supporting each other will make it easier for us to stay on track.\n\nKris was in support of just changing rooms. And that she\u2019s okay with keeping it all out of the communal spaces.\n\nLiv made a really big deal and has been excessively posting on tiktok and ig stuff like \u201cyour fat friends don\u2019t need to hear about how you\u2019re afraid of looking like them\u201d and all that. \n\nWhich\u2026 I\u2019m kind of offended that she\u2019s trying to make my thoughts/feelings about my body somehow about her. She doesn\u2019t usually show narcissistic tendencies, but it\u2019s really weird to me bc it\u2019s like when people are like \u201cOh you think YOU\u2019RE fat? Well what does that make ME then?\u201d and it\u2019s like chill, sis none of us were talking about you?\n\nAnyway Mads posted on here once about some family drama so she said I should see what y\u2019all think.", "created_utc": 1672675509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101g5hs/aita_for_refusing_to_make_our_suite_diet_culture/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Liv is the one trying to control and shame you about your body and diet.  Your doing nothing wrong, you are in fact, making sure that Liv can have even more room to be herself by changing rooms.\n\nShe said it was a problem to watch you count calories and diet so you are working with the situation your in to make everyone as comfortable as possible.  It sounds more like Liv wants you to conform to her standards which doesn't work because its not the Liv show.", "NTA Liv needs to grow up.", "NTA. Everyone is allowed to have personal goals. The key word is \u201cpersonal\u201d. No one else has to dedicate themselves to these goals. If she feels she can only make her own personal goals work with the support of the rest of the world, then she just needs to work on herself more. No one owes her.", "NTA Whatever she wants to do is her concern. It is a shared home. I mean I simply don\u2019t understand why she thinks she can impose her thoughts on you, anymore than she would want your thoughts imposed on her? All about choices here in a SHARED space.", "NTA. I get where she\u2019s coming from, because diet culture *is* terrible. However, trying to guilt your friends into the idea is not the way to get support. Plus there\u2019s a difference between diet culture and using healthy portioning and meal prep. Idk about using a scale, though.", "NTA. They requested an accommodation, you proposed a reasonable way to meet that accommodation, they're mad they weren't allowed to just have their way; too bad for them.", "NTA\n\nLiv's main problem is that she thought that being with her was more important to you.  You can't help that your own diet and health are more important.  She also has self-esteem issues as she's assuming you're making judgments about her when you're not.  It's not right of her to accuse you of making comparisons with her.  She's doing that all on her own.", "NTA. You're roommate doesn't get to declare that your shared space will be managed only in her way and you and the others have offered up a great compromise. I don't understand Liv is making drama over it.", "NTA What on earth is she on about? It's ridiculous in and of itself but the posting on tiktok thing really sells it. Ridiculous.", "NTA, it's ridiculous for her to tell you what you can and cannot do. \n\nBut it is also rude to talk about your weight negatively infront of people larger than you... So don't do that?", "NAH. Diet culture is really hard for people with a past of disordered eating and there are a lot of people who don\u2019t realize their \u2018healthy steps\u2019 turned disordered until they are much older. Your roommate is struggling with being inundated with diet culture and it really is everywhere. She asked you to put away a food scale. I\u2019m taking that to mean don\u2019t set it out in the counter all damn day just put it up unless it\u2019s in use but maybe I am wrong. Your response to that is, no I need to focus on losing whatever weight I put on constantly so I\u2019m leaving it out. I don\u2019t think you have any intent to harm her but she is also telling you what she needs. You tried to come up with a resolution to all of it and she took it to mean you chose a few pounds to lose over your friendship with her. I think this all boils down to really bad communication but also unfortunately it\u2019s your age. In college you all are still learning about yourself and the word and while many adults could have a calm conversation about needs without calling the other one a narcissist, it\u2019s quite likely that you, OP, truly don\u2019t understand why she is taking your choice the way she is and she doesn\u2019t understand why you would be so focused on losing a few pounds that you are willing to risk your friend\u2019s mental health to get there. You haven\u2019t been in her shoes and she hasn\u2019t been in yours. Take a breath and have a discussion to try and fix this by being clear you aren\u2019t trying to hurt her and you are not projecting your wants for your body onto her. And then listen when she explains why diet culture terms and actions can be so harmful for someone with disordered eating past.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell her you WILL do your diets, and if she does not want to switch rooms than it is HER problem that hshe will see you doing your diet stuff.  IGnore her drama.", "NTA.  She's actually being abusive.  She's doing what's called emotional blackmail.  She wants to control you, and because just telling you what to do didn't work, now she's trying to make you feel like you have to do what she wants or you don't care about her.\n\nYou're concerned with your long-term health.  It's not about looks.  \n\n(As others have said, however, don't let this become about her body.  That's not your business.  This is about you being the person who determines how you treat your body.)", "Nta. This is total narcisistic behavior. \u201cYour fat friends dont need to hear about how scared you are of looking like them\u201d\u2026. Obesity, heart problems, both are leading killers in north america. This has nothing to do with appearances, this is about health. Counting calories, portion control, those are not insane eating disorder things. If your friend can not support you taking care of yourself, they are not your friend. \n\nIf i had depression and wanted to start going for walks, but my friend said hey you cant do that because it makes me realize im depressed, so lets both sit inside forever\u2026.

Wow... love the diet culture going on over there...\n\nNTA!\n\nLiv only has a problem with the \"diet messaging\" because she has an issue about herself that she doesn't want to confront.\n\nAlthough I do have a question: does Liv have any unhealthy food issues that you haven't told us about? Because that would make this a whole different kettle of fish.", "NTA- but It sounds like this situation has been very difficult for you and your roommates. It's understandable that you want to take care of your own health and wellness, and it's also understandable that Liv would feel hurt and upset about being asked to switch rooms. It's important to remember that everyone has their own boundaries and preferences when it comes to conversations about diet and body image. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your roommates and try to find a solution that works for everyone. It might be helpful to have a group discussion to talk about your concerns and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with. It's also important to be respectful of each other's feelings and to try to be understanding of one another's perspectives.", "NTA, but watch how you express your thoughts. I would focus discussion more about how eating healthier improves how you feel.", "ESH \n\nTbh I was gonna say N A H when I read the first half. You have every right to count calories and weigh your food but it IS also intense and I wouldn't wanna be anywhere near you. I'm particularly sensitive as I have an eating disorder but it doesnt need to be that dramatic to not want all this around you, especially on a big celebration. \n\nShe's gone way too far posting online and being so critical of your diet itself rather than just it being around her. \n\n>but it\u2019s really weird to me bc it\u2019s like when people are like \u201cOh you think YOU\u2019RE fat? Well what does that make ME then?\u201d and it\u2019s like chill, sis none of us were talking about you?\n\nDont be deliberately obtuse. We can all tell who's bigger than who and to complain your weight is excessive people who are bigger is also calling their weight excessive. Come on you arent children you should understand your words have an impact even if you dont address them to the person directly. \n\nTo sum up; she wants you to all cater to her unreasonably but also you are very dismissive of her and making out that even her FEELING a certain way is silly.", "NTA. Liv is an insecure control freak with a \"my way or no way\" mentality. She has a lot of growing up to do in 2023.", "NTA  It sounds like she is projecting her insecurities onto you. Counting calories and minding portion sizes isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cdiet culture\u201d.

It is called healthy eating it a healthy lifestyle.  We each need to do what is best for our own bodies.  What is your roommate afraid of?   What bothers her so much about this?  When you have four people living together, who are all different, you have to learn to compromise. You offered a compromise, your roommate is not.  She wants it her way or the highway.  How does she not see that she is the unreasonable one in this equation?", "NTA but why would you make Liz switch rooms instead of either you or Mads moving rooms?", "Nta. Tell liv to grow the fuk up and stfu.", "NTA.  You're not putting up \"thinspiration\" stuff all over a shared space or dictating how she needs to eat. You're simply taking reasonable and prudent steps to ensure your health. She doesn't get to enforce her choices on you.", "NTA. You proposed a perfectly logical solution. She is trying to direct others to make her insecurities easier. Plus, it\u2019s evidently ok in her mind to make comments that she would lose her mind over if made to her?", "NTA - Liv is bat shit crazy thinking that she can control people, especially over something like that. She sounds insufferable not to mention mean and immature. She needs to mind her own business. You and your scale aren\u2019t hurting anyone", "NTA. Sounds like she is  projecting her own insecurities (whether she realizes it or not) on you. \n\nEveryone is allowed to have personal goals. Key word personal.", "NTA. I have the same feelings about diet culture as Liv but you have an ultimate right to decide what to do with your body unless your decision making capacity is impaired (doesn't sound like it is!). If you want to weigh your food in your own home, I think it's reasonable for Liv to ask you not to talk to her about it but it's not reasonable for her to ask you to stop. \n\nAlso - if you have \"chosen diet culture over\" Liv, surely she has chosen her anti-diet-culture stance over your right to bodily autonomy. Just saying.\n\nSigned, an anti-diet-culture fat lady who thinks you are the boss of your body!", "NTA. New Years Resolutions are for the person making it.

While I don\u2019t think OP in any way is making comments about anything but her own body, people often don\u2019t understand how their own words affect others. Most of us speak more harshly to and about ourselves than we would ever speak to someone else. However, for someone struggling with self love, it\u2019s hard to hear someone say they are unhappy with being a size 2 when the person overhearing is a size 10, etc. That person just put out in the universe that a size two isn\u2019t good enough for some reason. What are the people who are larger sizes supposed to think with that comment", "You're very likely an asshole.", "I wondered how long it would take before I ran across some fatphobic bullshit on this post.

They\u2019re not kicking her out, they\u2019re asking her to switch rooms so that it\u2019s possible to separate into their respective food habits, but the one roommate took it as a personal attack instead of seeing the reasonable compromise. \n\nAnd I may be the asshole here, but I\u2019m tired of everybody relying on others to feel better about themselves. If the one roommate is feeling insecure about her weight, *she* should change, and not expect everyone around her to completely comply so she \u201ccan be happy\u201d. It\u2019s like putting a bandaid on a gash that needs stitches. It seems like a solution, but it\u2019s not going to help.", "So true. Diet culture is all about deprivation and unhealthy habits. Using a scale to measure portions at home is a healthy lifestyle choice to help people who might struggle with over preparing and then feeling forced to overeat as a result (people like me).\n\nAlso, nowhere in OP do I see mention of there being a shared kitchen? Only bathroom and living room. So Liz wanting to ban everything from the suite sounds like a gross overreach.", "thanks, fixed", "If you buy into fatphobia BS you're part of the problem there is nothing beautiful about being fat it is unhealthy and leads to numerous health problems.  Being overweight should not be celebrated", "Also, the mere existence of a scale in the kitchen might just mean someone bakes. Not everyone uses cup measurements!", "But you have no idea of her size - you\u2019ve just jumped in to make fat phobic comments.", "Also, looking at your comments for two seconds tells me everything there is to know about you. Pro-christian nationalist who also hates fat people? Ugh, go away forever.", "If you have an issue with 'duet culture' ypur size is obvious and yes I'm making fatphobic comments it's a manageable health issue and when you want to hide away from positive messaging that actually can help you, I'm going to make fun of you for it because you don't want to face the truth of the situation", "I disagree. I have an issue with diet culture because so many people get disordered eating and I\u2019m not fat. You can\u2019t assume anything.\n\nSome people put on weight due to all sorts of health issues or meds. Some people have slower metabolisms. You\u2019re just ignorant.\n\nYes being fat can cause health problems but so can being underweight and having an eating disorder. If she\u2019s trying to avoid that then she\u2019s sensible"]}
