Take a breath and have a discussion to try and fix this by being clear you aren\u2019t trying to hurt her and you are not projecting your wants for your body onto her.

It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your roommates and try to find a solution that works for everyone.

It started out as a *wonderful* philosophy years ago - the idea that life is happening *now* and you can love yourself *now* no matter how you look. But it has since been partially hijacked by quite a mentally ill subset of society and it\u2019s really very sad and damaging to its followers. It\u2019s starting to reach cult status, and many victims have been known to lose their friends simply because they choose to prioritize their health.\n\nAnyway, my point is this isn\u2019t likely a temporary thing for her and probably won\u2019t be limited to just this post-New Year\u2019s time.

One of you will always be making the other uncomfortable.\n\nNote: I realize there were a lot of excellent foundational ideas to the HAES movement and there are *a lot* of people who follow HAES principles the way they were intended. All of the anti-discrimination progress has been amazing (standard sizes becoming larger, adequate seating spaces, ensuring doctors treat illnesses properly for *everyone* regardless of weight bias) so my criticism of HAES is for the small subset of people who take it too far, and start acting like the OP\u2019s roommate.\n\nEdit: You will always be \u201cdoing something wrong\u201d to look after your weight because Liv will view it as a direct attack upon her and a reflection of your opinion of her.

If we focused on being comfortable in our bodies no matter the size no one needs to be uncomfortable in the break room listening to \u201cskinnier\u201d people criticize their bodies. Think about all the things you miss out on while being insecure about your body. There\u2019s more to health than your weight.", "Calorie counting isn\u2019t ordered eating and diet culture is the fact that you think it is.", " Maintenance Phase is biased and misleading.", "Sounds to me like she doesn\u2019t want diet drinks or health shakes in the common areas which is completely wrong but up to the roommates to honor her wishes.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Designated Ugly Fat Friend apparently. Which is odd cos \"up the duff\" means pregnant.", "First time I've been botted! Thanks!", "Maybe you should stop trying to make everything about you, when people talk about THEIR bodies", "In this instance because the roommate actually stated they didn't want to discuss this type of thing (and OP agreed it wasn't a problem avoiding the issue), it would be best to not talk about it in front of the roommate. But I wouldn't make this a blanket general statement.", "The only immature is the one projecting herself into the lives of others and trying to dictate how they should manage their eating habits that dont include or are focused on her AT ALL", "Ah I see, so knowing how many calories you're eating is harmful and wrong. Gotcha.", "This is a comment stealing bot, downvote and report for spam", "Does it really?! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "You're welcome! Hope it's the last time your words are plagiarized.", "I honestly don\u2019t know how North America does things by volume. Especially baking. But I grew up using weight haha", "Yeah Even most modern American bakers are switching to weight. It's just easier for most things. Don't think my kitchen scale is precise enough for one gram of yeast though.", "This is a comment stealing bot, downvote and report for spam", "Up the duff? yeah its Aus & NZ slang I believe.", "Bakers comment here...I do now weight things for fancy pastries, but I learned by measure, and how to be consistent in my measuring. I also keep actual 1/2 cup scoops in each flour and sugar, so no extra washing. \n\nMain question...so, how ever did people bake for hundreds of years without scales??? All those medieval bakers? Households? \n\nTheories??", " By feel. I just made a loaf of bread. Followed the recipe \u201cexactly\u201d and it was still sticky and not balling up. So I added more flour and more flour and more flour. Probably an additional 2 cups OVER the maximum the recipe called for.", "3. Sometimes they use ratios rather than specific measurements; like 2 parts flour, 2 parts oats, 2 part brown sugar, 1 part butter, and a sprinkle of salt, will make a nice apple crisp topping whether you're making a skillet full or just enough to top a single apple.\n2. People can learn to measure ingredients based on what they have available. Anyone with functional hands can measure a handful or a pinch, and any drinking cup, bowl, or spoon can be used to measure ratios.\nAnd most importantly 1. People who learn by being taught by another person (often mother, grandmother, aunt, etc) have a chance to learn the correct appearance and feel of a food in a way that a printed recipe can't entirely capture. So whether you put 150 or 170 grams of cornmeal in your bowl, if you know exactly how sticky it should be then you'll still add the right amount of water without having to rely on a scale to do it for you. If you have experience with rice, you can judge the water level with a knuckle instead of a measuring cup. If you have grandma's sourdough bread bowl, you know that the dough rises to this line's height before it gets baked.", "Who says medieval bakers didn't have scales? If your bread was found to be underweight, there were legal consequences.\n\n(P.S. The earliest scales archaeologists have found date back to 2000BC.)", "They used scales?? People have had scales since antiquity. Just the ones where you put weights on one side and it tips up. Like in the symbol for justice"]}
