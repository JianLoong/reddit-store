I think this all boils down to really bad communication but also unfortunately it\u2019s your age.

Take a breath and have a discussion to try and fix this by being clear you aren\u2019t trying to hurt her and you are not projecting your wants for your body onto her.

It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your roommates and try to find a solution that works for everyone.

If you are just minding your own business and happen to weigh your food, fair enough.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s subscribing to the Fat Acceptance (FA) and Healthy At Every Size (HAES) movement. It started out as a *wonderful* philosophy years ago - the idea that life is happening *now* and you can love yourself *now* no matter how you look. But it has since been partially hijacked by quite a mentally ill subset of society and it\u2019s really very sad and damaging to its followers. It\u2019s starting to reach cult status, and many victims have been known to lose their friends simply because they choose to prioritize their health.\n\nAnyway, my point is this isn\u2019t likely a temporary thing for her and probably won\u2019t be limited to just this post-New Year\u2019s time.

One of you will always be making the other uncomfortable.\n\nNote: I realize there were a lot of excellent foundational ideas to the HAES movement and there are *a lot* of people who follow HAES principles the way they were intended. All of the anti-discrimination progress has been amazing (standard sizes becoming larger, adequate seating spaces, ensuring doctors treat illnesses properly for *everyone* regardless of weight bias) so my criticism of HAES is for the small subset of people who take it too far, and start acting like the OP\u2019s roommate.\n\nEdit: You will always be \u201cdoing something wrong\u201d to look after your weight because Liv will view it as a direct attack upon her and a reflection of your opinion of her.
