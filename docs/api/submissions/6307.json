Take a breath and have a discussion to try and fix this by being clear you aren\u2019t trying to hurt her and you are not projecting your wants for your body onto her.

It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your roommates and try to find a solution that works for everyone.

It started out as a *wonderful* philosophy years ago - the idea that life is happening *now* and you can love yourself *now* no matter how you look. But it has since been partially hijacked by quite a mentally ill subset of society and it\u2019s really very sad and damaging to its followers.

One of you will always be making the other uncomfortable.\n\nNote: I realize there were a lot of excellent foundational ideas to the HAES movement and there are *a lot* of people who follow HAES principles the way they were intended. All of the anti-discrimination progress has been amazing (standard sizes becoming larger, adequate seating spaces, ensuring doctors treat illnesses properly for *everyone* regardless of weight bias) so my criticism of HAES is for the small subset of people who take it too far, and start acting like the OP\u2019s roommate.\n\nEdit: You will always be \u201cdoing something wrong\u201d to look after your weight because Liv will view it as a direct attack upon her and a reflection of your opinion of her.

That\u2019s quite the defensive answer for someone trying to explain that OP\u2019s friend clearly has some struggles with health and diet culture and that neither OP nor the friend are going about this in a healthy way. I never said a scale was diet culture, way to read into what you wanted. I said that she asked it not be out in the open and perhaps the compromise here could be to put it in a cabinet or drawer unless used. It is OP that connected the food scale to her attempt to lose weight so in this case it is a diet tool, which is fine, but the friend is asking not to see it. OP noted that she is really only willing to not talk about food with this friend but isn\u2019t considering that there is a lot more to actual diet culture. She can choose to diet any time she pleases, but someone pointing out that many people have disordered eating issues that aren\u2019t identified for years and it\u2019s more than just talk that can be hard for some is out of line? Good grief. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH for trying to lose weight. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH for thinking she found the solution to the problem. I think both OP and the friend suck because neither one of them communicate like adults. If I care about my friend and they are struggling with something and something I am doing innocently is creating a harder time for my friend to recover, I am open to numerous ways to help that action not be a problem. From what we know here, the only compromise OP is giving is switching rooms because her semester\u2019s weight gain is so important she can\u2019t work with the friend to learn what is most harmful and what is ok. The friend expects OP to instantly get on board with her anti-diet culture and that isn\u2019t fair  or acceptable either. Conversation is what is missing here but sure, I am out of line.", "You are 100% correct. The inherent nature of these things has nothing to do with diet culture. However in the post both of these things are absolutely connected to diet culture and the friend knows this. I think meal planning is fine and that should absolutely be a concession by the friend. I think putting a scale away when not in use is a concession that can and could easily be made by OP. I don\u2019t think OP is making any mistakes in her plan for how to approach life and dieting. I simply believe she went from zero to sixty on ways to solve the problem when a conversation would have been more productive and less hurtful to the roommate. My issue is that her roommate is also her friend and has outright told her she feels cast aside for the sole reason that OP wants to lose weight. That isn\u2019t OPs intent and I think she can do a better job of talking with the roommate and coming to an agreement on how to interact with each other.", "What you are referring to as ordered eating can very easily lead to disordered eating. Disordered eating is when simple steps with good intentions become obsessive, unhelpful, and unhealthy. Counting calories for some people is perfectly fine just as drinking a glass of wine at dinner is perfectly fine for some people. For others, this leads to obsessive counting, restricting and overcompensating, and mental spiraling. Similarly, for some people one glass of wine can lead to a bottle and can lead to the necessity of that drink every day. It isn\u2019t the action itself that is disordered it\u2019s the increased desire and need for control that stems from the action for certain people. \n\nDiet culture is simply the terms and actions of control, restriction, and exertion that are continually  ormalized into society. In almost all cases this isn\u2019t intention by actual people (companies are another story). This is the perfect time of year to witness both the obvious and non obvious cultural norms. Every other add on TV is for WW or Noom it feels like. But further, one of the highest grossing fitness apps is centered around tracking calories and macros. All perfectly harmless data on its own. But that data being pushed into awareness on an hour by hour basis, the commonly held belief that an adult needs 1200 calories a day, these are all examples of diet culture. Almost every person has at one time heard that fruit isn\u2019t good while dieting as it has too much sugar. Many people will question putting an entire banana into a smoothie because of the carbs. There are many who feel they should only order a salad from a restaurant menu. Workout trainers who will casually tell you to push harder so you can have pizza later or to work off the pie you ate. All of these are ingrained diet culture that is everywhere, at least in the US. And for those who are working to re-order their relationship with food, exercise, their bodies and their health, these common and small things add up and are very hard to remove from thought processes. For many who have been on more than one diet in their lifetime, whether it be a trendy diet or simply counting calories, all forms of restriction or continued control seeking behavior can become disordered and/or very hard to remove from our instinctive thoughts. Again, what you referred to as ordered eating isn\u2019t harmful on its own and I do believe many people can \u2018diet\u2019 without hurting their mental health and creating a disordered eating mentality, but I would also argue many people find the longer they struggle with weight and the more diets they take on in their lifetime the more the chances of slowly becoming disordered with food is likely. \n\nI think the roommate taking the issue to social media is AH behavior. I think she isn\u2019t working on her own issues as thoroughly as she might assume. I also think, like many people, there is a lot of misunderstanding regarding disordered eating and what causes it. Many people would say anorexia, bulletin, and orthoexia (so?) are the entirety of disordered eating. They are diagnosis but not the only disordered eating out there. And we don\u2019t know anything about the friend and her history and what size she is and whether or not she is always starting a new diet, etc.", "Oh god, shut up.

I don\u2019t understand why your so angry about Op making that choice, but some people don\u2019t feel good with extra weight on their bodies and that\u2019s why I said everyone\u2019s health is different and Op may be really bothered not in the way that she looks but how she feels and it\u2019s effecting their mental health to be that way. I hope you see past that anger to view how others may be effected and not just Ops friend.", "Do you also think having a financial budget is disordered?", "Hmmm I wonder why that might be? It\u2019s been decades since I was in college but I have lots of memories of sitting around with friends dissecting nights out including people and outfits and haircuts and boyfriends and all kinds of gossip. I don\u2019t know anyone who lived in a dorm who didn\u2019t share that experience. You think that this friend who is trying to make a health conscious move for herself hasn\u2019t sat in and possibly participated in these type of discussions? So when you hear someone say something negative about their own look and you share a negative feature you haven\u2019t thought, hmmm she must think that of me too? It\u2019s a common projection. It is a projection and I am sure it is an innocent comment on OPs part, but a tiny modicum of rational thought would explain why it\u2019s so easily projected onto other self conscious people. But that isn\u2019t really something that most people understand until they are older and stop caring what anyone says. So yes, they are both immature. And also, someone who is using the anti-diet culture terminology is likely someone who is immersed in some form of therapy whether it be general or food based. They are someone who has struggled with dieting in the past. Let\u2019s not act like this person is 100% mentally healthy and feeling self secure and unshakeable. She\u2019s a college kid for goodness sake. And one who has clearly frustrated herself with dientinf for years. She isn\u2019t asking OP to not diet, she\u2019s asking her to put away diet tools in common spaces and not talk about food and dieting. Neither should be hard to do, but OP decided to ask her to move rooms. Neither girl is communicating well. I\u2019m not calling OP an AH for dieting and I\u2019m not saying she is the only one here that could stand to re-evaluate her actions. I think both should. But I also think the fact that it came to this is not surprising given their age and life experience.", "I don\u2019t understand why you think I am so angry and I don\u2019t understand your first sentence. What I am saying is that OP noted the scale is for portion control which is where she feels she is lacking in her health journey. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with that. But also, many of these things can be put up when not in use. We put our toaster up when not in use. I have a food scale for bread baking myself. It\u2019s in a cabinet when not in use. What I am saying is that both of these girls have a right to their feelings but neither are expressing them to the other properly and as friends who want to continue that relationship I think they need to do more than just switch rooms. I think, from what is written here OP\u2019s only concession was to not talk about food or move out. I think that\u2019s rather harsh and short sighted. I think the friend also needs to have a discussion about her thoughts to better understand and make her own concessions. Jesus y\u2019all seem to project your own defensiveness into what you read. I never once said I was angry about OPs choice nor did I imply it. I think if she values this friendship she will regret not being more communicative and helpful to her friend by at least talking this out. As someone who has experience with anti-diet culture and have watched a handful of people begin the anti-diet culture journey many are struggling with lots of life things that they keep locked up. I have seen very few people here want to give the friend some grace in her journey and help lead OP to potentially salvage a friendship she values.

People around me talk about losing weight/calories/etc., and I have to have the mental fortitude to not project my situation onto others and expect them to adhere to my philosophy. I can share my philosophy as a part of contributing to the conversation--but no one should ever be saying one way is \"right\" or \"wrong\".

Weight stigma and negative body image is something that is really, really hard to deal with. Diet culture teaches us to draw comparisons of one body to the next with the idea that larger bodies are bad bodies. When people around you want to lose weight and talk about their weight in a negative way, it's very easy to draw the conclusion that big body == bad, my body == big body, therefore my body == bad. It's not something you can just \"chill out\" about and it will take a lot of time to heal from those thoughts.
