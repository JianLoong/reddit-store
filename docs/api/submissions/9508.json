Part of this stems from my work travel schedule, and the demands of my job, and has resulted in us going to therapy. That hasn't worked out because our therapist was... less than competent. He actually made things infinitely worse by creating communication issues for a week by telling my wife not to respond if I contacted her while I was traveling and that he would message me that he would talk to me solo the next week... except **he never did**. So I was texting my wife for a week to no response, and she thought he had asked me not to, so she thought I was fucking with her.\n\nSo this week, when I returned home from travel, my wife was noncommunicative the first day or so. We talked a bit the next night, sorted out the above issue (after which I fired the therapist) and she divulged under duress that she was planning to see other people. There was a lot more to the discussion, but given that, she talked about spending the rest of the week at friends' houses. I mentioned that I would need the car to go on what was our planned ski trip, indicating I would be going alone.\n\nThe following morning, she said she was thinking about just staying that night at a friend's and coming back the next. So I was optimistic that maybe we would work things out. Then she talked about going to visit her sister and using a friend's car to do that. The ski trip and her sister's house are the same general direction, both several hours drive. So, being an optimist, I said maybe she could just drop me off. She says something about 'not being able to go on her dream vacation?'. Immediately, I got a funny vibe, but I let it go.\n\nWell, tonight she calls after work, and has decided to spend both tonight and tomorrow at friends, and  then all day Friday doing personal stuff, and then come home to pack for the trip Saturday. Clearly when she says 'the trip', she means skiing. She says that she'll drop me off, go to her sister's and then maybe come up for a few days. I didn't respond at all on the call so as not to fly off the handle.\n\nAfter we hung up, I texted her that I did not want to spend all that time in a car with someone who clearly did not want to be around me, just for the sake of convenience, and that I would rent a car and she could take ours. And that if she wanted to ski, I would send her the email with the pre-paid pass info. Without being explicit, I was implying that she would not be welcome to stay in the room. I wrote that I felt I was being used for the trip (that I paid for 100% of and would cancel were I able to at this point) and she would clearly rather be with anyone but me.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my wife not to come on our planned vacation?", "created_utc": 1675905325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xh3qa/aita_for_telling_my_wife_not_to_come_on_vacation/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I actually would have had no problem with my wife wanting to see other people if she hadn't just accused me of cheating.

There was another charge on a card that I could not see the detail for, but was enough of an amount to be a hotel room. This would have both been during the week that she was unresponsive to my texts.

I asked why wouldn't she open it, and she told me.", "She is my best friend and we've often said we are soul mates. Something change in October of last year and I cannot figure out what.", "I guess I was saving that for the follow up to find out if she would respond productively to me telling her how much that hurt.

There is still a lot of emotion here.", "It isn't that I didn't communicate with her for that week; I did text her. But everything else about this is accurate. We communicate well only in person. Every other aspect of our communication is shit.\n\nAnd you're right, I rejected her and I should have tried a different approach.\n\nThanks.", "Not separated, and that post came last week while I was not hearing back from her.\n\nHonestly not sure how you're seeing it though, because I 'hid' it soon after posting. Should have just deleted it maybe.", "I did not like him from the first visit and should have gone with my gut, but I was trying hard to show I was willing to work on things.

So, hang in there a lil longer\u2026hope it all works out for you like it did for me! \n\nNot sure where your wife\u2019s mind is, but perhaps you two can take an attachment style survey (if you haven\u2019t yet) and see how things might go if you have date night before trying for multi day vacation? She could also for the last 24 hours of the trip so you two can have some space before but come together for a nice dinner and morning ski or something? \n\nI don\u2019t think multiple days together is healthy right now considering her statement about seeing other people though. Also, has she expressed why she wants to see other people? Does she feel like she\u2019s \u201cmissed out\u201d or is she just \u201crunning away\u201d because she has insecure attachment issues?", "Don\u2019t give up! Convince her to go.. even if it doesn\u2019t work out at least you tried", "I hope I'm wrong too, but please pay attention to where she's going at the very least.", "Yeah, it might be over at this point. You are seriously the only person trying here.", "Sounds like she already is seeing other people", "well only way to find out is to talk, she might not know how you feel and if you open up she might too.", "also did the trip already happen or still happening?", "Ahh, okay. Yeah that\u2019s cause for concern. Is this a new marriage? Do you have a significant amount of established good standing with one another? Has anything like this happened before? Are you interested in maintaining this marriage? \n\nI ask because I\u2019m sensing almost an aloofness in you/your wife\u2019s behavior. If I was having this kind of conflict with my partner I\u2019d be extremely upset, but you both seem to be relatively casual about this. Are you guys not very close or something? Is that accurate or could I maybe be misinterpreting your post due to text not containing tone?", "Was she receptive to your honesty or did it just go the same as usual? Unfortunately with what you have been saying she may already be out the door. I would just ask her honestly if there is any hope of things working out and if not maybe take a friend, try to enjoy yourself and use it as a time of reflection and acceptance. If she does see there is a chance, then I would insist that if she wants to go she needs to be home at least the night before so you can talk and prep. I would also consider each writing a letter about what each of you feels like you need from the other to be happy. I have known my fianc\u00e9e for 10 years and we had dated a couple times.

Last year, she went through therapy (which I supported) and has become more independent. I don't mind that at all, what I do mind is that she did not bring me along in that process with her. I asked if I could help by joining any sessions and she said no. Then when she ended therapy, a lot of these issues started.\n\nI'm not saying the therapy caused this. If anything, I think stopping it may have. I'm saying that to her, independence means something different. We did not have issues in our marriage before October 2022.

(Of course, fully acknowledge she may have just been saying that, but it felt truly genuine at the time)\n\nThat said, the steps that they say to take now feel instructive, and I will do that.

From where I stand ESA.", "You do seem hard to follow.", "Her response to what?", "Okay then hopefully you can work through that. One helpful tool my husband and I used was writing a letter to express how we felt about certain issues. We would read the letters and agreed to not get angry and just let the words sit in our mind and soak in. \n\nThen we would let the person who wrote the letter decide if they wanted to say anything or if they wanted the other to speak and share what they gathered from the letter. The purpose was to allow our emotions to be shared without fear of a reaction from the other and to feel heard. We made sure we didn\u2019t use language that tried to minimize our own actions and instead asked for examples on how to handle things better in the future. Oh and LOTS of pauses before speaking to make sure we don\u2019t respond in defense of ourselves.\n\nIt\u2019s such a delicate time, but you *can* work through it. Good luck!!", "Ok understood, I just misinterpreted the tone of your post. \n\nwith this info, I really think that you should let her come on this trip with you.
