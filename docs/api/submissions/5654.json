Sometimes these deviants need to be confronted as they come across.  Don\u2019t apologize or become contrite.  It\u2019s because of everyone taking this verbal abuse and behavior that this idiot is still doing it.  When someone finally has had enough and does to him what he does to others, there is a slight chance that he might change his behavior.  But don\u2019t count on it.

A lot of people needed to sit in their enabling of this man's horrid behavior. You did what needed to be done. Those folks silently appreciate you, they just didn't have the balls to say it.\n\nA few years ago, I stood up to my narcissistic aunt at Christmas. I had enough of her racism and homophobic vitriol. I was shaking so hard but I told her I would no longer listen to her say another racist or homophobic word in my home. That if she wanted to be in my home, she would use loving language only, or she would leave. \n \nIt caused a huge battle and my Aunt tried to book a flight home on Christmas that year, yelling at agents on the phone for not booking flights for her immediately.

It's not your house so it's not really your place. If you dont' like it, do what your brother did and not bring his family over when this guy is around.\n2. Your stepdad for inviting this guy. I don't care what this guy's situation is but I wouldn't tolerate someone like that. You say that your stepdad isn't racist or sexist but by inviting this person into your home year after year is condoning it. He may not be racist but he's not anti-racist (please look that up if you're not aware of the term). If he genuinely was concerned about the vitriol out of this guy's mouth, he wouldn't invite him OR he would invite him on the condition that he doesn't bring up anything offense and that if he does then he will be asked to leave. \n3. I can completely understand your blood boiling and you had enough, especially year after year. You stilll could have said it better. Like for the sake of your family maybe say \"I really don't appreciate your sexist or racist comments considering the diversity in our family. I will ask you to please stop and if you won't, then we won't continue sitting at this table with you and we will (choose what action you'll take)\".", "Switching to NTA from ESH.   \nThat guy\u2019s an A, for obvious reasons.\n\nYour step-dad\u2019s an A for choosing his \u201cfriend\u201d over your brother\u2019s family.\n\nYou because it\u2019s not your house (right?) so it\u2019s not up to you to decide who can be there. The \u201cI don\u2019t want you around this family\u201c part. It just isn\u2019t up to you, but it\u2019s totally reasonable to let your mom/stepdad know that you choose not to be around him, and let them decide who they want to invite. So leaving was the right choice, & I can\u2019t criticize you too much for being rude to someone who\u2019s that rude\u2026 I think I\u2019m talking myself into changing my ruling!", "ESH.
