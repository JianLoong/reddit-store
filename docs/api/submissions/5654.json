I don't care what this guy's situation is but I wouldn't tolerate someone like that. You say that your stepdad isn't racist or sexist but by inviting this person into your home year after year is condoning it. He may not be racist but he's not anti-racist (please look that up if you're not aware of the term). If he genuinely was concerned about the vitriol out of this guy's mouth, he wouldn't invite him OR he would invite him on the condition that he doesn't bring up anything offense and that if he does then he will be asked to leave. \n3.
