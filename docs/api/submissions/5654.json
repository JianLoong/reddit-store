You say that your stepdad isn't racist or sexist but by inviting this person into your home year after year is condoning it. He may not be racist but he's not anti-racist (please look that up if you're not aware of the term).

So you stood up for your foreign-born family members, told a repugnant racist exactly what he is, opened dialogue in your family about their experiences, and ensured a big, beautiful family Christmas next year with all the little ones around with wholesome attitudes around them. \n\nI\u2019d say you win Christmas.\n\nBut some dialogue needs to happen with your step-father. You said he\u2019s a mild man, so all you need is a mild approach, like apologizing for losing your temper, but you meant what you said and does he (step-dad) understand where you\u2019re coming from? Let him say his piece, and try to reassure each other that you love each other and you\u2019ll both work to be accountable for who\u2019s around at holidays.\n\nEdit: added judgement.", "NTA - The enablers have allowed this person to ruin Christmas for the grandkids year after year. This should have stopped there. It continued, which is the most shocking part. Who puts a random family friend over having the grandkids on Christmas? I hope everybody got the point. Do not go back. If they still invite this racist dipshit, start a new tradition with your brother, his kids who've been missing out for years, and anybody else who wants a dipshit free Christmas lunch. Don't worry if you can't cook, with a smidge of advance ordering you can get a pre-cooked meal from your local grocery store (or fancier stores/delis) to heat up on the day. Hope your future holidays are peaceful and happy without the racist awfulness that's been inflicted on you for far too long.", "Ironically, if someone had done what you did a log time ago he may have changed his ways and actually have been a pleasure to around.

Your stepdad and that person can continue to have Christmas lunch together but you and the rest of the family should get together elsewhere where stepdad and his guest won't bother anyone and won't be invited too.

No one should tolerate that.", "\ud83e\udd22", "NTA. It seems that other people felt like you did and you were their voice. Maybe the comments are why this person doesn't have anywhere else to go.

You lost your temper and you are trying to justify why. It\u2019s hard because you are right. He is a racist weirdo. But you are still the asshole because you spoke on behalf of others without asking, in the middle of dinner when you could have done this privately.

Was it held at your home? You could have called out him but I don' t think you had any right to tell him not to come.
