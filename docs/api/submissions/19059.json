Her situation is irrelevant to you and the situation at hand.\n\nYou're likely not wrong she's overcompensating, but she hasn't figured that out yet, so just shut it down rather than get into a complicated psychology behind it. Calling out bad behavior is going to be way more useful for both you and her long run as she gets boundaries drawn out clearly. Body dysmorphia kinda screws those up, but she'll ignore it if she sees it as a transphobic attack, which it can be construed as, even though the reality seems to be you being fed up over her commenting on your body.", "ESH\n\nShe should have minded her own business, and did a tad more research about shaving one's legs. It literally has nothing to do with hygiene. It's just a societal norm that came about because of the razor companies during WWI. They wanted to drive sales, and the styles coming out at the time were revealing legs and armpits, so they started advertising that their brands were great for women shaving their legs and armpits. Took off from there. I will say that her current incorrect info might be word of mouth and not any real reliable sources.\nYour thought process regarding her transitioning are very close minded and discriminatory, and your comments to her were out of line.

It's fine she likes that. It's fine she wants to be a tradwife. Some folks do.

She can just be trans and not have to talk down on others in order to prove herself.
