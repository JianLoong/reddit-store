{"id": 3901, "submission_id": "zby7sz", "title": "AITA for printing out a map of the grocery store for my dad?", "selftext": "I (18f) am the only daughter in a family of 4 boys (15, 13, 10, 8). Our dad is pretty much a single parent, since he and our mom divorced when the boys were younger and mom lives out of the country with her husband.\n\nIt\u2019s more or less become my job to be the mother 2.0. Which is fine I guess, I\u2019m doing college online so it\u2019s not like I wouldn\u2019t be home to do stuff anyway.\nOne of my unofficial \u201cjobs\u201d is to help my dad grocery shop. I used to go with him to do it, and I would make the list myself and just grab what we needed, but now that I drive the boys around for their extracurriculars and I\u2019m busy with school or chores when I\u2019m not helping them, I don\u2019t really have the time.\nI just started writing the list and giving it to my dad so he could go out and get what we needed.\n\nEvery single time this man has gone to the grocery store by himself he has either completely forgotten about the list, remembered the list then lost it, remembered the list but ignored it, or somehow could not find more than half of the things on it.\nIt\u2019s hard to cook an actual dinner when literally half of what he ends up bringing home is frozen meals and pasta sauce (but no pasta).\n\nI\u2019ve brought it up to him, but dad keeps saying that if I would just make time to go with him or if I went on my own, it would probably be easier to get what we needed. I said that we could switch jobs, so he takes the boys to their things and I get groceries, but he said he doesn\u2019t know their schedules and he wouldn\u2019t want to mess it up for them.\n\nHe said he\u2019d go grocery shopping today, and asked me to go with him, but I was working on some stuff for my finals before I had to drive the 10yo and 8yo to their practices so I couldn\u2019t go.\nI started making the list like I usually do, but because I didn\u2019t want to end up with only half of what I\u2019d put on there, I went and printed the layout of the grocery store. I even went online and found which aisle each product was supposed to be in and I color coded the stuff he needed to get. I left it for him on the table and then went to take the boys.\n\nWhile I was doing school work during their practice, my dad called me asking why I felt the need to color code a map for him like he was a toddler in need of specific instruction. I replied saying that I only thought the map might make it easier for him to find the things I put on the list, since I also made sure that everything was in stock online.\n\nIt\u2019s been hours since we\u2019ve gotten back home and he\u2019s very clearly upset with me, but he did get the stuff on the list this time.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I think maybe I just made him feel like an idiot and that\u2019s why he\u2019s upset. Was the map thing a little too much?\n\nETA:\n\n- I don\u2019t really talk to my mom much, so that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t asked her for help with this or anything. I don\u2019t even know what help she could provide since she lives like halfway across the world.\n\n- My brothers do recognize that our dad doesn\u2019t really do much other than work and come home. The boys help when they can, and they offer to do more, I just usually tell them to focus on doing the few chores I\u2019ve given them while I handle everything else because it\u2019s just what I\u2019m used to now.\n\n- My 15yo brother will be doing most of the driving once he gets his license. He has his permit right now so I can\u2019t just send him out on his own lol.\n\n- Also all the comments really did put a whole lot into perspective for me. I\u2019m realizing how unfair a lot of this has been on me, and I\u2019m going to try to talk to my dad about it bc I do want a social life outside of conversations with the moms on the practice field.", "created_utc": 1670121605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zby7sz/aita_for_printing_out_a_map_of_the_grocery_store/", "score": 2114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Live your life!** Look into moving out if you have to, if your dad tries to push back about you refusing to be mom-wife 2.0 anymore. Drop the rope! \n\nNTA you never should have gotten a map and written a colour coded grocery list at all, he should have been doing grocery shopping perfectly on his own for years, even long before your mom left. Just like you shouldn't have been the one to colour code your brothers' schedule either. You basically have 5 kids at the moment, your 4 brothers and your father (and one of them is a baby). ^(BTW never marry someone like your dad or have kids with if you ever want to raise kids again)", "Yes. You have. Are you off to college? Maybe a 6-month volunteer position out-of-state? A relative you can spend the summer with?? You need to regain some portion of your youth.", "(lol) We all dream about being that level of petty, but in reality it would punish not just dad, but OP and her 4 blameless younger brothers. \\*sigh\\*too harsh", ">The older kids do help with some of the chores. The 15yo and 13yo do their own laundry, they both alternate between who does the dishes or who sweeps the kitchen, and the 10yo helps me with folding sheets and towels and stuff like that. The 8yo likes cooking so sometimes he\u2019ll help me make breakfast for everyone.  \n>  \n>And I was about 13. My parents separated when I was 12, and my mom ended up moving to a different state shortly before she met her husband and they moved out of country. We saw her sometimes but it wasn\u2019t very often, so I just started doing all the stuff she used to do I guess.\n\nYup.  You need to go away to college.  They won't starve.  They will be forced to figure it out. You deserve to have some fun.", "The pandemic exploding the order for pick up or delivery market was the best thing to come out of it for me, personally. I order ahead, pick up after work, never set foot in the store. I still get to use all coupons and such, as well, so I can shop sales. Also cuts down on the impulse shopping, too.", "I had an offer to do a study abroad summer course for about 2 months that I originally said no to bc I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone but I\u2019ll probably call the program coordinator tomorrow and ask if they\u2019re still accepting applications.", "Obviously it\u2019s not a long term solution, but I would 100% do it for at least a meal or two to make the point.", "PLEASE DO. You deserve something for yourself.", "I live in the living room of our one bedroom apt and gave the room to my 2 sons. I have a daybed that doubles as our couch. It\u2019s worth it to be able to have my boys with me though I don\u2019t ever want to be without them.", "I'm proud of you. People don't hear that enough. How old are they? My (31m) daughter is 2 she's the love of my life and my little clone.", "OP \n\n>Also all the comments really did put a whole lot into perspective for me. I\u2019m realizing how unfair a lot of this has been on me, and I\u2019m going to try to talk to my dad about it bc I do want a social life outside of conversations with the moms on the practice field.\n\nthis is my favorite edit of yours. You are NTA.", "NTA I\u2019m 61 yo and I\u2019ve only been on Reddit a few weeks and learned \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d and \u201cparentification\u201d. Now it\u2019s your turn to learn!", "NTA, if your dad wants to treat you like your everyone\u2019s mother then refuse to actually be helpful and take responsibility for the children HE created, he better be prepared to be treated like the toddler he is.", "NTA, honey you\u2019re a kid not their mom or a replacement wife, the fact that your GROWN ass father can\u2019t do anything without being told what to do and shown like a kid is his fault not yours. honestly you need to slow down the help because the minute you leave he will make you feel like shit for it", "NTA \nYour dad got angry only because he couldn\u2019t weaponise his incompetence any longer.", "NTA and not his wife. Your father needs to learn that you are not supposed to be responsible for all of this and should be getting ready to enter the next stage of your life. I don\u2019t think that he intentionally takes you for granted but, he is. What is he going to do when you find a career and move out? His feelings might have been hurt by your map but, it effectively got him to actually use the list. It seems that you are parenting your parent. Being a father is more than just working and paying the bills, it is literally all of the things that you are doing. Not knowing their schedules is a cop out. Him putting all of his responsibilities on you is bad for you both. I don\u2019t get the feeling that you are a confrontational person so, I suggest finding away to make yourself incrementally unavailable to coerce him into stepping up. Maybe designate times for you to go to the library to study or work it out where you take the boys to practice but, he has to pick them up. I know that you are a compassionate and responsible person who loves her family but, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it, this is an unhealthy family dynamic. I would also recommend reading about \u201cThe Necessary Hero\u201d and \u201cThe Substitute\u201d archetypes for a little more perspective as to why this is unhealthy. Good luck to you", "I think that's called \"weaponized incompetence\"\n\nbasically someone just pretends to be helpless so you'll do their shitwork\n\nI used to do that to my dad as a kid when I didn't wanna do yard work lmao, but I can't imagine a grown ass man doing it to his daughter.", "He\u2019s a single parent of four kids with no help from his ex. He\u2019s struggling to work full time and raise these children. I\u2019d say he\u2019s not avoiding responsibility. I\u2019d say he\u2019s worn out and needs a life raft. \n\nI\u2019m voting NAH. \nYour dad is doing the best he can. Normally, he\u2019d have help from another parent to balance the load. But he doesn\u2019t have that.  \n\nHe puts some of that load on you because you are the oldest. I don\u2019t blame you for felling overwhelmed.\n\nI think in situations like this, there needs to be realistic expectations from all parties. If you are driving your siblings everywhere, then they probably have too many activities. I feel like parents overload their kids with extra activities and this puts a lot of strain on the family. I suggest that your dad cut back for both your sakes.", "Yeah, he is mad because he couldn't find a way to screw it up and he actually had to do it.", "And even if it's an actual adult married couple it shouldn't be only on the wife/mom to do 100% of the childcare and household works while husband/father isn't contributing at home.", "There is no way I would leave my child. EVER!", "Yes.  My dad can't change a light bulb, reheat a meal, or turn of the main waterline in a house he has owned for 45 years.  He is fine being waited on hand and foot.  Of course, this means two of his children actively hate him and I couldn't be bothered.  My brother will have to do the heavy lifting soon.  Or his partner, as will probably happen.", "DO IT! If it's too late for that program, look into other programs too! Please finally do something for yourself! It will do good for you in more ways than you can probably image it now, including helping you with stepping back from being a mother of 5 and building your own life instead. I hope you will update us!", "I mean she's not much better considering she abandoned her kids and left them with a useless moron.", "SEARCHING for this comment", "Pretty rotten for a woman to abandon her children like that. That means the youngest was 6 when she moved away.", "I\u2019m sorry. If it were me, I\u2019d tell Dad that if he acts like a toddler, he\u2019ll be treated like a toddler. But I don\u2019t think shaming him or helping him will help him change. He behaves this way because a woman has always stepped up to do things for him. \n\nIt\u2019s hard, though, because you don\u2019t want to abandon your brothers. But you have to live your life too.", "NTA, sweetie I really want you to go away to college for a year. You deserve to be a kid for a while. Dad and your siblings will be all right.", "So...your dad is incapable of driving the kids around, is incapable of grocery shopping, and has the gall to be offended when you give him a detailed map to ensure he finds and brings home everything? No wonder your mom left him...\n\nNTA", "Please do it, it's a once in a lifetime chance. Don't let him take this away from you because he wants to pretend he's incapable of managing a house as well as an 18 year old. You will kick yourself forever", "OP, if this program doesn't work out, find another, or get an internship, and definitely start to take some classes outside of the house.  \n\nIn addition, consider getting some counseling. Everyone is right on point with the parentification and weaponized incompetence, but you have been in the caretaking role for years and you will need some support to break free from that.", "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO!!!"]}
