I even went online and found which aisle each product was supposed to be in and I color coded the stuff he needed to get. I left it for him on the table and then went to take the boys.\n\nWhile I was doing school work during their practice, my dad called me asking why I felt the need to color code a map for him like he was a toddler in need of specific instruction.
