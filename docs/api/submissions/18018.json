{"id": 18018, "submission_id": "13q1fhw", "title": "AITA for prioritizing my downtime when I get out of work?", "selftext": "My wife is a SAHM currently to our 3 kids and she is also currently pregnant with a boy. Our 3 kids are 4 (triplets- 2 girls and a boy). Her job is INCREDIBLY hard. I would never downplay the struggles of a stay-at-home parent. The kids are super rambunctious and on top of that, we also have 2 high energy dogs that also have anxiety and whine nonstop. My wife gets touched out often and try as I may, it never seems like I can correct it for her. \n\nNow, I own my own business. My wife runs the finances on it (she wants to- she says it's her way of contributing) and honestly, she's the reason it's so successful. Sure, she isn't doing the physical labor of it BUT I'm not exactly great with money like she is so when I first opened the business, it plummeted fast but she corrected my fuck ups and she turned it in to a very successful business. I'm indebted to her honestly and again, I would never downplay her role. \n\nThe issue is that whenever my wife gets touched out, she gets really snappy and irritable if I don't do things immediately when getting home. Whether it be doing dishes or running a bath for the kids or tending to the dogs, etc etc. Or this is what it feels like anyways, but that could be work stress talking. So I talked to her about it last night because when I got home she immediately said \"Thank god you're home. Can you please help me? I need to check the fuck out.\" I did help and she went and did her thing but later on I said \"you know hunny, I would really appreciate if you let me prioritize my downtime for a bit when I get home instead of immediately asking me to do everything the second I walk through the door\". She got angry. Didn't say anything at all, just went to sleep on the couch. The next day she sent me a multi page text explaining her position. Saying that the fact that she even has to ask me for help is draining and the fact that I feel the need to prioritize myself when I have kids at home and a touched out pregnant wife who is struggling to keep up her mental health is selfish and inconsiderate. She also said that she shouldn't have to keep running on empty for me to get downtime when she never gets any downtime unless she asks me first because once the kids are settled, she still has to be a wife and show affection (I never asked this of her, it's just who she is as a person). I haven't responded yet but AITA?\n\nETA: please stop with the \"you're an AH for bringing in a 4th kid when you can't even handle the 3 you have\" comments. My wife is fixed. She had her tubes tied AND burnt when they did the C-section for the triplets. This was not a planned thing. This was not supposed to happen but it did. We had no reason to believe it would be a failed surgery, as we have continued to have a very healthy intimate life and never had so much as a \"oh fuck\" moment until 6 months ago.", "created_utc": 1684877391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q1fhw/aita_for_prioritizing_my_downtime_when_i_get_out/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're devaluing her contributions and labor.", "Holy fuck YTA. You have 3 young children who she is the primary caregiver of ON TOP of working. Your downtime exists when those kids are asleep.", "Sorry but YTA. Your wife is not a SAHM since she is actively involved with your business. Plus she shouldn't need to ask your \"help\".  You don't help when you are the parent. Parent your children!", "So your wife is doing the physical and mental labor of caring for three toddlers and a home, and she's *also* handling a large chunk of the mental labor for your business by keeping the finances in check for you. And she's doing all this while pregnant. I'm not saying your job is easy, but at least you get out of the house for a little bit. She already gets zero downtime, but you want her to be okay watching *you* get some downtime while she's been struggling all day? Do you seriously need to be told YTA", "Yta.  Where's her downtime?  How long does she have to wait?  You're a parent.  So guess what, you're home, you're on.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your wife is effectively a single mom. To add to the fact she\u2019s pregnant - wow, just wow. \n\nI\u2019m also guessing you\u2019re American. Parenting in the US is especially stressful, lonesome, and costly (even with a supportive and loving partner). \n\nYou don\u2019t get to prioritize downtime when you\u2019re home. You need to be ready to execute parenting duties.\n\nIt\u2019s too much? Yeah, ask your wife. \n\nMy suggestion. Hire help to ease her burdens during the day. It doesn\u2019t have to be all day, but try three hours a day. Three full hours, likely midday would be best (but ask your wife). \n\nThen maybe you can have some downtime when you first get home. Obviously it needs to be limited, because again parenting (and then spousal) duties need to be met.\n\nAre you being an asshole to your wife? Yes.\nAre you being an asshole to your children? Yes.", "YTA.  The real kicker here is that you go out of your way to sing her praises for what she does, pointing out how challenging it all is ... and then when she explains why you're an AH, you don't listen to her!

She needs it.\nAnd get snipped. Your responsibility is not just your business (which anyway she helps with). \n\nSTEP UP! Your wife deserves nothing else.", "YTA - where is her downtime?", "YTA- most homes with kids have a routine, so no she should not have to ask you to do something when you get home.  You get downtime when those kids are in bed like every other parent.  she gets no downtime, she is pregnant and most likely really uncomfortable 24/7.   Here is an idea, hire a sitter!  Give yourself both some downtime. Maybe get her a massage at a nice spa and you do something you like too. (doesnt have to be a couples day)", "YTA - Hey honey when I get home from work I need some downtime to destress. But I expect you to work all day and then continue working while I destress and don\u2019t get a break.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get downtime from being a mom. You don\u2019t get to pause being a dad.  Plus the pregnancy is making things worse for her.\n\nSuck it up for another year until kids go to kinder and there\u2019s less touching so you both can get downtime.", "YTA, three kids and running part of your business. She has to fucking exhausted. In this situation there is no downtime. You need to be helping out when you get home.", "YTA. She is dealing with 3 kids, 2 hyper active dogs (idk why you got dogs cuz it sounds like your house is crazy enough but hey you do you), bailed your ass out, all while pregnant. And you told her you would like it if she didn\u2019t ask you to contribute? Are you serious? You don\u2019t get downtime when you want it welcome to parenthood. You can get it once the kids are in bed and taken care of. Your the father and husband, that means you help your wife and mother of your child with what she can\u2019t do on her own, that\u2019s how relationships work if you don\u2019t want that you should not have become a father. \n\nWhat you need to do is take a day off work and send your wife to a spa for several hours Jesus.", "YTA\nParenting isn\u2019t just at your convenience. Your job and the drive home is the downtown you get from parenting. As soon as you walk in the door you should be immediately helping out with your kids so your wife can get a little bit of a break since she has the kids herself all day.", "YTA, probably\n\nOne way to look at the situation is to imagine that your wife has to leave for some reason, and you are now 24/7 responsible for your kids, home, and job. In this imaginary situation, can you afford to pay a babysitter to be in your home in the evenings so that you could prioritize your downtime? \n\nIf you can afford help, get some. \n\nIf you can't afford help, then get used to jumping right in as soon as you get home. \n\nIt's only going to get busier so be realistic in your expectations.", "Unless having more kids is something your wife talked you into by saying she could handle everything, then sorry, YTA . You don't get downtime after work, you need to get home and start your second shift. That's too many kids for someone to handle alone, especially while pregnant.", "Even though I totally agree with you that it sucks to walk in the door and immediately have to jump in and take over without being able to decompress for a sec (I\u2019m saying this as a single mom), I\u2019ve gotta say YTA because in all truth, taking care of three very young kids all day, dogs, etc. just *is* more work and more stressful than what you\u2019ve got going on all day yourself. It just is. \n\n*BUT*, YTA for not being more understanding and accommodating of your wife and suggesting that she\u2019s wrong for literally counting the hours all day until another adult walks in the door to help her out. However, you\u2019re *not* the asshole for not wanting to take over as soon as you walk in the door. SO, you either need to talk to your wife and look into hiring someone to help out with literally anything in the house - the kids, the dogs, cleaning, cooking, OR you need to figure out some arrangement (alone time, shifts, trips to the spa, anything) that will keep your wife from losing her mind. Preferably both.", "YTA Your wife needs help. Whether or not you believe she needs it as much as she says she needs it, it doesn't really matter what your opinion is. Your partner says she needs help. It sucks when two people in relationship put their needs in opposition. A successful relationship only happens when both people have their needs met. You guys need to sit down and figure out a way that both of you can have your needs met at the same time. If that means hiring an afternoon nanny, that's what it means. If that means putting the children and preschool in the mornings, that's what you got to do.", "YTA", "Yta, why do you think your downtime is more priority than your wife? Do you not find the drive home as some downtime?", "YTA - Since you run a business schedule 30 minutes a day for personal down time. Do not do this at the end of the day cause when you hit the door you should be 100% tag teaming her with the kids, dogs and household needs.  She is literally running on fumes. \n\nIt's good this blew up. She told you her perspective so value the mutual communication and make it work.  What strategies should you both continue and what new approaches need to be explored? Best to you all!", "I am sorry to say but yes YTA. Because she has to ask, because she has to keep mental notes of what needs to be done to remind you of it, she has no free time at all. You are also the parent, and should see what needs to be done and if your wife needs anything (as she does for you and your kids).", "YTA Downtime is a thing of the past when you have a young family. It goes the way of sleeping in, privacy and enjoying a quiet meal. I am sure you wife would love to put up her feet as well after a long day. Your downtime is when your children are in bed and on the weekends. So until your children are a little more independent you're going to have to suck it up buttercup.", "Just so I have this straight, you want to come home from work and have downtime while your pregnant wife continues to parent your three rambunctious children and dogs, successfully manage your company\u2019s finances, and continues to be responsible for the household chores and you want to know if YTA? Ummm yeah, YTA.", "It\u2019s tough. You are both working all day, you with your business and she with the kids, the dogs, the house, the groceries, the errands, and running the finances of your business. She\u2019s also pregnant. YTA. She needs some downtime too. Would it be possible to hire help for a few hours a day to give her some relief?", "YTA here. Your downtime comes at the same time as hers, when all kids are in bed. In the waking hours it\u2019s all hands on deck parenting. It won\u2019t last forever. But for now, you need to reframe your thinking as to what your schedule should look like, and absolutely be ready to jump straight into the fray the minute you walk in the door.", "YTA, hooooooly.\n\nShe\u2019s working 1.5x to your 0.5 and at half power being pregnant.

Do I have that right? \n\nDude, I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t get any down time at all ever (as long as she does as well) but you should ABSOLUTELY be taking those kids off your wife\u2019s hands without her asking the second you walk in the door for at least an hour or two. And you need to figure out what\u2019s going to happen when the baby comes. Are you taking significant paternity leave to support your family? Are you hiring help? This is unsustainable for her.

So not only is your wife acting like a god sent mother of your kids, shes also basically your accountant. Shes working over time and you need to snip your balls or something and go help out. You're a fully grown adult, if you didn't want to have kids and take care of them, you shouldn't have been a father. Being a dad doesn't mean you just make money and then come home to a lovely wife, it means compromising to help EACH OTHER.

Sorry, working at an office (unless you are doing hard physical labor) isn't nearly as stressful as running after 3 kids and 2 dogs. You have downtime during the day.

When my husband got home from work his priority was to spend time with our children.  If he was home when I was cooking dinner he took care of them.  After dinner he would bathe them while I cleaned the kitchen.  That was my first break during the day, doing the dishes.  We were both working hard and equally sharing the work.

Our 3 kids are 4 (triplets- 2 girls and a boy). Her job is INCREDIBLY hard. I would never downplay the struggles of a stay-at-home parent. The kids are super rambunctious and on top of that, we also have 2 high energy dogs that also have anxiety and whine nonstop. My wife gets touched out often and try as I may, it never seems like I can correct it for her. \n\nNow, I own my own business. My wife runs the finances on it (she wants to- she says it's her way of contributing) and honestly, she's the reason it's so successful. Sure, she isn't doing the physical labor of it BUT I'm not exactly great with money like she is so when I first opened the business, it plummeted fast but she corrected my fuck ups and she turned it in to a very successful business. I'm indebted to her honestly and again, I would never downplay her role. \n\nThe issue is that whenever my wife gets touched out, she gets really snappy and irritable if I don't do things immediately when getting home. Whether it be doing dishes or running a bath for the kids or tending to the dogs, etc etc. Or this is what it feels like anyways, but that could be work stress talking. So I talked to her about it last night because when I got home she immediately said \"Thank god you're home. Can you please help me? I need to check the fuck out.\" I did help and she went and did her thing but later on I said \"you know hunny, I would really appreciate if you let me prioritize my downtime for a bit when I get home instead of immediately asking me to do everything the second I walk through the door\". She got angry. Didn't say anything at all, just went to sleep on the couch. The next day she sent me a multi page text explaining her position. Saying that the fact that she even has to ask me for help is draining and the fact that I feel the need to prioritize myself when I have kids at home and a touched out pregnant wife who is struggling to keep up her mental health is selfish and inconsiderate. She also said that she shouldn't have to keep running on empty for me to get downtime when she never gets any downtime unless she asks me first because once the kids are settled, she still has to be a wife and show affection (I never asked this of her, it's just who she is as a person). I haven't responded yet but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s your downtime. Likely more than she gets in a day! YTA", "YTA the issue is that you are mentally checked out from the running of the house. If you were living alone you would take a more active role in cleaning/shopping/doing chores \u2014 it is called the mental load and she is handling all of it in your house. It is NOT fair to her that she has to work sun up to sun down doing childcare without a guaranteed rest, let you have your time (which she isn't guaranteed to have herself that day, and if she does she might have to use for basic self care stuff you take for granted like being able to shower or pee alone since you get to do that every morning as part of your work routine), and then have to ask you to be involved in the house. She is doing all the mental balancing for the house and then you won't even do the physical execution of tasks for her because you want time off. She doesn't get any of that.\n\nAnd you're double TA for insisting you \"never ask for affection,\" but she wants to do it for you. Like yes, she does because she loves your foolish ass and doesn't want to check out of your relationship like you have done with her. That stuff is vital to keeping a relationship in a good place, and she is trying just for you even though she is exhausted! What are you doing for her in return to show her you love her and value her contribution to your family? Or would you prefer her to stop it all, and just treat you like a roommate? \n\nTriple YTA for acting like being a parent to your kids and feeding/doing bedtime/etc. for one night is some remarkable standard of contribution instead of just the basic expectation of being a parent. It's not like she left for 3 weeks so you have to solely take care of the kids. This is your life for the next 20 years man, get used to it.\n\nCurrently she is living with you in the same house but *around* you \u2014 you probably check in and chat with her sometimes but you aren't actually participating emotionally in the day to day. Isn't it kinda sad that your partner in life feels the need to have to literally beg you to assist her, because she doesn't feel you'd even care to notice or give her a hand with her struggles on your own? You need to step up and be a part of her life where you help her out when she is literally crying for support. It's what you signed up for when you agreed to marry her and have kids.\n\nIt's not like you don't *deserve* the time to yourself. Everyone does, including her. But it's not realistic when your wife is at breaking point. It's like borrowing the hose to fill up a pool and go for a swim when she is trying to put out her clothes being on fire.", "YTA. So your wife takes care of the kids all day and does your businesses finances. When you get home from work, you get to relax\u2026when does she relax?", "I explained to my husband,when our kids were young, that his down time was the car ride home. As a sahm I got zero down time.", "At work you get downtime moments. You get a lunch/breaks/commute to relax. Your wife gets none of those. Do your share. Relax when the kids are asleep.

You have it very easy comparatively.", "YTA, and I honestly can not believe you can not see that?!?", "I wonder if his spouse is touched out?  Could she be touched out?  He ought to check with her to see if she's touched out.  His wife may be touched out.  Does he worry that his wife may be touched out???", "Definitely YTA. She works full-time AND takes care of triplets AND two dogs AND she's pregnant again?!?! You should be prioritizing your wife and kids when you come in from work until the kids go to bed. She shouldn't have to ASK you for help everyday.", "Did you\u2026did you just refer to your wife as \u2018fixed\u2019 as if she is a dog? YTA my dude.", "YTA \n\nI don\u2019t understand how you just listed out all that is on her plate and then followed it up with \u201cwhat about meeeeeeee\u201d?!?", "I think you have enough correct judgements. How about a solution?\nIs your wife being paid to do Financials? Can it be budgeted in the business? Then can that money be put towards some help for your wife during the day to lessen her load?", "Dude. YTA. And do you have ANY idea how hard it is to have to first help someone else help you?? Meaning, before I can get your help, I first have to tell you I need it, explain why I need it, and also insist that I need it urgently?  Good God man. The poor woman. It is so draining to be a one-man parent show, and then have a spouse who ultimately acts like a child as well, who you have to coddle through the contributions you would like them to make.", "YTA", "The fact that you said \u201cmy wife is fixed\u201d makes me want to fucking vomit. That alone makes you the asshole. She\u2019s not a breeding animal for your children. \n\nBeyond that, YTA. **SHE** runs a successful business and you\u2019re an employee that works there. Then she also runs a successful household. All she asks for is a small amount of time to herself when you get home. HELP HER.", "YTA.  You're not pulling your weight here!  The least you can do is give her a break as soon as you get home.\n\nAnd if your business is so successful, why haven't you hired a mother's helper or a nanny to lighten her load?", "I don't think any of us could fairly judge him. Those who do not have the mental capacity should not stand trial.", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s downtime is going to be first. Yours is second.

So basically he needs until the kids are in bed before he's ready to consider doing something to help?

Getting to/from a job is not \u201cfree time.\u201d In a better society commutes would always be part of paid hours, because they\u2019re part of working outside the home & you can\u2019t really do anything else during them. \n\nBut again, OP sucks butts for thinking his under-appreciated wife should just let him kick back for who knows how long after work. Kids don\u2019t really wait for you to be \u201cready\u201d to parent lol, that\u2019s sort of the most well-known thing about having them!", "This a 10000%!! Get your wife some help!

She got her tubes tied right after the triplets. This baby was definitely not planned.", "I may have agreed with this without the following:\n\n1) triplets. One is hard, but manageable most of the time. With one i think a reasonable amount of downtime for both is good. This, however, is literally three times harder if not technically more for the compounding factor. Down time for both is going to be scarce.\n\n2) he didn't ask to prioritize his down time right when he gets home, acting like she gets a break somewhere in this mess. As the wife said when he gets home she is empty. That is the time to give her a break and recharge at least a little.\n\n3) The fact that he doesn't dispute having to be asked to do literally anything. Clearly he doesn't take initiative in his home life.\n\n4) The fact that she has to ask for downtime herself suggests that he isnt great at making the initiative in his relationship.\n\nSure communication is good in relationships, but if what you are communicating is inherently selfish then it still makes you an AH. This is clearly YTA.", "And this bozo gets a literal lunch break while she gets three tiny dictators that follow her into the bathroom so she can't even pee in peace.", "Right?

Is he around or can he be more involved", "All you did was list why he was wrong.

Ooooooh boy.", "Seriously though OP, would you downplay the importance of the CFO of another business just because they happened to have taken the perk of working from home? Why is it different because *your* CFO is your wife and you know that she's doing it because she *also* has to be primary parent because you won't step up?", "If you can make a list of why someone wrong the they are an AH in the scenario. NAH neither are are in the wrong or both are justified.\n\nOn top of that, if you are that oblivious to your own short coming then also YTA.
