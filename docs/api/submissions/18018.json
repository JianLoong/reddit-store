{"id": 18018, "submission_id": "13q1fhw", "title": "AITA for prioritizing my downtime when I get out of work?", "selftext": "My wife is a SAHM currently to our 3 kids and she is also currently pregnant with a boy. Our 3 kids are 4 (triplets- 2 girls and a boy). Her job is INCREDIBLY hard. I would never downplay the struggles of a stay-at-home parent. The kids are super rambunctious and on top of that, we also have 2 high energy dogs that also have anxiety and whine nonstop. My wife gets touched out often and try as I may, it never seems like I can correct it for her. \n\nNow, I own my own business. My wife runs the finances on it (she wants to- she says it's her way of contributing) and honestly, she's the reason it's so successful. Sure, she isn't doing the physical labor of it BUT I'm not exactly great with money like she is so when I first opened the business, it plummeted fast but she corrected my fuck ups and she turned it in to a very successful business. I'm indebted to her honestly and again, I would never downplay her role. \n\nThe issue is that whenever my wife gets touched out, she gets really snappy and irritable if I don't do things immediately when getting home. Whether it be doing dishes or running a bath for the kids or tending to the dogs, etc etc. Or this is what it feels like anyways, but that could be work stress talking. So I talked to her about it last night because when I got home she immediately said \"Thank god you're home. Can you please help me? I need to check the fuck out.\" I did help and she went and did her thing but later on I said \"you know hunny, I would really appreciate if you let me prioritize my downtime for a bit when I get home instead of immediately asking me to do everything the second I walk through the door\". She got angry. Didn't say anything at all, just went to sleep on the couch. The next day she sent me a multi page text explaining her position. Saying that the fact that she even has to ask me for help is draining and the fact that I feel the need to prioritize myself when I have kids at home and a touched out pregnant wife who is struggling to keep up her mental health is selfish and inconsiderate. She also said that she shouldn't have to keep running on empty for me to get downtime when she never gets any downtime unless she asks me first because once the kids are settled, she still has to be a wife and show affection (I never asked this of her, it's just who she is as a person). I haven't responded yet but AITA?\n\nETA: please stop with the \"you're an AH for bringing in a 4th kid when you can't even handle the 3 you have\" comments. My wife is fixed. She had her tubes tied AND burnt when they did the C-section for the triplets. This was not a planned thing. This was not supposed to happen but it did. We had no reason to believe it would be a failed surgery, as we have continued to have a very healthy intimate life and never had so much as a \"oh fuck\" moment until 6 months ago.", "created_utc": 1684877391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q1fhw/aita_for_prioritizing_my_downtime_when_i_get_out/", "score": 1050, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're devaluing her contributions and labor.", "Holy fuck YTA. You have 3 young children who she is the primary caregiver of ON TOP of working. Your downtime exists when those kids are asleep.", "Sorry but YTA. Your wife is not a SAHM since she is actively involved with your business. Plus she shouldn't need to ask your \"help\".  You don't help when you are the parent. Parent your children!", "So your wife is doing the physical and mental labor of caring for three toddlers and a home, and she's *also* handling a large chunk of the mental labor for your business by keeping the finances in check for you. And she's doing all this while pregnant. I'm not saying your job is easy, but at least you get out of the house for a little bit. She already gets zero downtime, but you want her to be okay watching *you* get some downtime while she's been struggling all day? Do you seriously need to be told YTA", "Yta.  Where's her downtime?  How long does she have to wait?  You're a parent.  So guess what, you're home, you're on.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your wife is effectively a single mom. To add to the fact she\u2019s pregnant - wow, just wow. \n\nI\u2019m also guessing you\u2019re American. Parenting in the US is especially stressful, lonesome, and costly (even with a supportive and loving partner). \n\nYou don\u2019t get to prioritize downtime when you\u2019re home. You need to be ready to execute parenting duties.\n\nIt\u2019s too much? Yeah, ask your wife. \n\nMy suggestion. Hire help to ease her burdens during the day. It doesn\u2019t have to be all day, but try three hours a day. Three full hours, likely midday would be best (but ask your wife). \n\nThen maybe you can have some downtime when you first get home. Obviously it needs to be limited, because again parenting (and then spousal) duties need to be met.\n\nAre you being an asshole to your wife? Yes.\nAre you being an asshole to your children? Yes.\n\nEdit: just read the edits and comments, you\u2019re so much worse than I gave you credit. For the love of humanity, get snipped or as you like to say \u201cfixed\u201d. \n\nYou got major main character syndrome vibes. Buddy, you\u2019d be lucky to even be a non-speaking extra, let alone the main character. \n\nI\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re intentionally keeping your wife this exhausted, so she won\u2019t get to be in her right mind. If so, she\u2019d likely leave you.", "YTA.  The real kicker here is that you go out of your way to sing her praises for what she does, pointing out how challenging it all is ... and then when she explains why you're an AH, you don't listen to her!

You get downtime on your commute. The moment you walk in that door, you are on duty, because now it\u2019s her turn to get a little downtime for the first time since you walked out the door that morning.\n\nIf you need another moment or two after a hard day, take another 5-minute spin around the block before you pull into the driveway, but it is not her job to \u201cprioritize your downtime\u201d as you so tactlessly put it.", "YTA -   Of course you are the AH for saying \"ME FIRST!\"  \"I WANT MY DOWNTIME AND MY ME TIME FIRST\".

She needs it.\nAnd get snipped. Your responsibility is not just your business (which anyway she helps with). \n\nSTEP UP! Your wife deserves nothing else.", "YTA - where is her downtime?", "YTA- most homes with kids have a routine, so no she should not have to ask you to do something when you get home.  You get downtime when those kids are in bed like every other parent.  she gets no downtime, she is pregnant and most likely really uncomfortable 24/7.   Here is an idea, hire a sitter!  Give yourself both some downtime. Maybe get her a massage at a nice spa and you do something you like too. (doesnt have to be a couples day)", "YTA - Hey honey when I get home from work I need some downtime to destress. But I expect you to work all day and then continue working while I destress and don\u2019t get a break.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get downtime from being a mom. You don\u2019t get to pause being a dad.  Plus the pregnancy is making things worse for her.\n\nSuck it up for another year until kids go to kinder and there\u2019s less touching so you both can get downtime.", "YTA, three kids and running part of your business. She has to fucking exhausted. In this situation there is no downtime. You need to be helping out when you get home.", "YTA. She is dealing with 3 kids, 2 hyper active dogs (idk why you got dogs cuz it sounds like your house is crazy enough but hey you do you), bailed your ass out, all while pregnant. And you told her you would like it if she didn\u2019t ask you to contribute? Are you serious? You don\u2019t get downtime when you want it welcome to parenthood. You can get it once the kids are in bed and taken care of. Your the father and husband, that means you help your wife and mother of your child with what she can\u2019t do on her own, that\u2019s how relationships work if you don\u2019t want that you should not have become a father. \n\nWhat you need to do is take a day off work and send your wife to a spa for several hours Jesus.", "YTA\nParenting isn\u2019t just at your convenience. Your job and the drive home is the downtime you get from parenting. As soon as you walk in the door you should be immediately helping out with your kids so your wife can get a little bit of a break since she has the kids herself all day.", "YTA, probably\n\nOne way to look at the situation is to imagine that your wife has to leave for some reason, and you are now 24/7 responsible for your kids, home, and job. In this imaginary situation, can you afford to pay a babysitter to be in your home in the evenings so that you could prioritize your downtime? \n\nIf you can afford help, get some. \n\nIf you can't afford help, then get used to jumping right in as soon as you get home. \n\nIt's only going to get busier so be realistic in your expectations.", "Unless having more kids is something your wife talked you into by saying she could handle everything, then sorry, YTA . You don't get downtime after work, you need to get home and start your second shift. That's too many kids for someone to handle alone, especially while pregnant.", "Even though I totally agree with you that it sucks to walk in the door and immediately have to jump in and take over without being able to decompress for a sec (I\u2019m saying this as a single mom), I\u2019ve gotta say YTA because in all truth, taking care of three very young kids all day, dogs, etc. just *is* more work and more stressful than what you\u2019ve got going on all day yourself. It just is. \n\n*BUT*, YTA for not being more understanding and accommodating of your wife and suggesting that she\u2019s wrong for literally counting the hours all day until another adult walks in the door to help her out. However, you\u2019re *not* the asshole for not wanting to take over as soon as you walk in the door. SO, you either need to talk to your wife and look into hiring someone to help out with literally anything in the house - the kids, the dogs, cleaning, cooking, OR you need to figure out some arrangement (alone time, shifts, trips to the spa, anything) that will keep your wife from losing her mind. Preferably both.", "YTA Your wife needs help. Whether or not you believe she needs it as much as she says she needs it, it doesn't really matter what your opinion is. Your partner says she needs help. It sucks when two people in relationship put their needs in opposition. A successful relationship only happens when both people have their needs met. You guys need to sit down and figure out a way that both of you can have your needs met at the same time. If that means hiring an afternoon nanny, that's what it means. If that means putting the children and preschool in the mornings, that's what you got to do.", "YTA", "Yta, why do you think your downtime is more priority than your wife? Do you not find the drive home as some downtime?", "YTA - Since you run a business schedule 30 minutes a day for personal down time. Do not do this at the end of the day cause when you hit the door you should be 100% tag teaming her with the kids, dogs and household needs.  She is literally running on fumes. \n\nIt's good this blew up. She told you her perspective so value the mutual communication and make it work.  What strategies should you both continue and what new approaches need to be explored? Best to you all!", "I am sorry to say but yes YTA. Because she has to ask, because she has to keep mental notes of what needs to be done to remind you of it, she has no free time at all. You are also the parent, and should see what needs to be done and if your wife needs anything (as she does for you and your kids).", "YTA Downtime is a thing of the past when you have a young family. It goes the way of sleeping in, privacy and enjoying a quiet meal. I am sure you wife would love to put up her feet as well after a long day. Your downtime is when your children are in bed and on the weekends. So until your children are a little more independent you're going to have to suck it up buttercup.", "Just so I have this straight, you want to come home from work and have downtime while your pregnant wife continues to parent your three rambunctious children and dogs, successfully manage your company\u2019s finances, and continues to be responsible for the household chores and you want to know if YTA? Ummm yeah, YTA.", "It\u2019s tough. You are both working all day, you with your business and she with the kids, the dogs, the house, the groceries, the errands, and running the finances of your business. She\u2019s also pregnant. YTA. She needs some downtime too. Would it be possible to hire help for a few hours a day to give her some relief?", "YTA here. Your downtime comes at the same time as hers, when all kids are in bed. In the waking hours it\u2019s all hands on deck parenting. It won\u2019t last forever.

Do I have that right? \n\nDude, I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t get any down time at all ever (as long as she does as well) but you should ABSOLUTELY be taking those kids off your wife\u2019s hands without her asking the second you walk in the door for at least an hour or two. And you need to figure out what\u2019s going to happen when the baby comes. Are you taking significant paternity leave to support your family? Are you hiring help? This is unsustainable for her.

So not only is your wife acting like a god sent mother of your kids, shes also basically your accountant. Shes working over time and you need to snip your balls or something and go help out. You're a fully grown adult, if you didn't want to have kids and take care of them, you shouldn't have been a father. Being a dad doesn't mean you just make money and then come home to a lovely wife, it means compromising to help EACH OTHER.

Sorry, working at an office (unless you are doing hard physical labor) isn't nearly as stressful as running after 3 kids and 2 dogs. You have downtime during the day.

When my husband got home from work his priority was to spend time with our children.  If he was home when I was cooking dinner he took care of them.  After dinner he would bathe them while I cleaned the kitchen.  That was my first break during the day, doing the dishes.  We were both working hard and equally sharing the work.

Our 3 kids are 4 (triplets- 2 girls and a boy). Her job is INCREDIBLY hard. I would never downplay the struggles of a stay-at-home parent. The kids are super rambunctious and on top of that, we also have 2 high energy dogs that also have anxiety and whine nonstop. My wife gets touched out often and try as I may, it never seems like I can correct it for her. \n\nNow, I own my own business. My wife runs the finances on it (she wants to- she says it's her way of contributing) and honestly, she's the reason it's so successful. Sure, she isn't doing the physical labor of it BUT I'm not exactly great with money like she is so when I first opened the business, it plummeted fast but she corrected my fuck ups and she turned it in to a very successful business. I'm indebted to her honestly and again, I would never downplay her role. \n\nThe issue is that whenever my wife gets touched out, she gets really snappy and irritable if I don't do things immediately when getting home. Whether it be doing dishes or running a bath for the kids or tending to the dogs, etc etc. Or this is what it feels like anyways, but that could be work stress talking. So I talked to her about it last night because when I got home she immediately said \"Thank god you're home. Can you please help me? I need to check the fuck out.\" I did help and she went and did her thing but later on I said \"you know hunny, I would really appreciate if you let me prioritize my downtime for a bit when I get home instead of immediately asking me to do everything the second I walk through the door\". She got angry. Didn't say anything at all, just went to sleep on the couch. The next day she sent me a multi page text explaining her position. Saying that the fact that she even has to ask me for help is draining and the fact that I feel the need to prioritize myself when I have kids at home and a touched out pregnant wife who is struggling to keep up her mental health is selfish and inconsiderate. She also said that she shouldn't have to keep running on empty for me to get downtime when she never gets any downtime unless she asks me first because once the kids are settled, she still has to be a wife and show affection (I never asked this of her, it's just who she is as a person). I haven't responded yet but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s your downtime. Likely more than she gets in a day! YTA", "YTA the issue is that you are mentally checked out from the running of the house. If you were living alone you would take a more active role in cleaning/shopping/doing chores \u2014 it is called the mental load and she is handling all of it in your house. It is NOT fair to her that she has to work sun up to sun down doing childcare without a guaranteed rest, let you have your time (which she isn't guaranteed to have herself that day, and if she does she might have to use for basic self care stuff you take for granted like being able to shower or pee alone since you get to do that every morning as part of your work routine), and then have to ask you to be involved in the house. She is doing all the mental balancing for the house and then you won't even do the physical execution of tasks for her because you want time off. She doesn't get any of that.\n\nAnd you're double TA for insisting you \"never ask for affection,\" but she wants to do it for you. Like yes, she does because she loves your foolish ass and doesn't want to check out of your relationship like you have done with her. That stuff is vital to keeping a relationship in a good place, and she is trying just for you even though she is exhausted!

Or would you prefer her to stop it all, and just treat you like a roommate? \n\nTriple YTA for acting like being a parent to your kids and feeding/doing bedtime/etc. for one night is some remarkable standard of contribution instead of just the basic expectation of being a parent. It's not like she left for 3 weeks so you have to solely take care of the kids. This is your life for the next 20 years man, get used to it.\n\nCurrently she is living with you in the same house but *around* you \u2014 you probably check in and chat with her sometimes but you aren't actually participating emotionally in the day to day. Isn't it kinda sad that your partner in life feels the need to have to literally beg you to assist her, because she doesn't feel you'd even care to notice or give her a hand with her struggles on your own? You need to step up and be a part of her life where you help her out when she is literally crying for support. It's what you signed up for when you agreed to marry her and have kids.\n\nIt's not like you don't *deserve* the time to yourself. Everyone does, including her.

Also he came home at the same time every day so I could plan how long I needed to hold out till I got some purely solo down time.

If you were expecting an hour to chill out, that's simply unrealistic. \n\nHowever, your wife is currently giving *everything* she has. And it's only going to get harder for her during the third trimester, let alone postpartum. You guys NEED to figure out a support system: NOW. Whether that's family, a nanny/babysitter etc - you need more hands on deck. And hire someone to look after the business for a while so that she doesn't have to. Start this process now.\n\nAnd if you need 5mins to yourself, do it in the car before you open the door. Your wife is telling you she doesn't have anything more in the tank to give you, and if she's going for a VBAC then it's going to be incredibly dangerous for her to go into labour exhausted. For her sake and your unborn child's, she *needs* to be able to drop some of her workload and be able to rest in the lead up to birth.\n\nShe also needs to have her space in the evenings. If she's feeling \"touched out\", and is still feeling (maybe unspoken/autopilot) pressure to be affectionate towards you, you need to nip that in the bud - if she's a \"giver\", she might be her own worst enemy.\n\nShe's currently primed for postpartum/perinatal depression, so as a family, you need to work on setting yourselves up for success - i.e. get your support network sorted.

Even then taking 2 hours when you get home is never going to be acceptable until the kids are grown and gone. Which is when you'll miss this.

When you\u2019re a parent there\u2019s not that much room for downtime, deal with it. Be a parent, man up. My gosh.", "YTA, when is her downtime? Seriously, when?", "Sorry, but YTA. I'm a SAHM with 3 children and have been for 13.5 years. I was blessed with 3 of the most mellow, non crying and well behaved  babies and toddlers on the planet who were also fantastic sleepers to boot. And even with those wonderful attributes I still had 3 children under 6 (when my 3rd was born) so it was still a lot of work. It would've probably been a little less work if I had a different personality, but since I am who I am I cooked 5 to 6 days per week, cut and styled my family's hair, cleaned a lot cuz I like a clean looking and clean smelling house, volunteered at the kid's school a lot once they started, did all the shopping and bill paying, ran all the errands and was very anal about organizing and making my home pretty. It didn't feel like a whole lot but everyone else thought it was (I always told them it wasn't) and now looking back I realize how much it was. But what helped was my supportive husband. Yes, he worked 10 hours per day and any overtime we needed but he also helped in any way I asked. He was in charge of outdoor play with the kids on the weekends so I could clean inside or just chill out, he was in charge of helping with all homework except English/Grammar/Language Arts/English Lit because that was my major and all art projects (he's super artistic and talented). Yes, I liked to do most of my own cooking a d cleaning but whatever I asked him to do, he did. I never had to ask him to play with or spend time with them because he was happy to do so when he got home. Yes, he was tired when he got home as he worked a physically demanding job but he sucked it up. I remember before I quit working how it feels getting home after picking up our 3 kids from daycare/school, but the work didn't stop when we got home. We had to do what all parents of little ones do after getting home at the end of the day, plus I breastfed all my children for 18 months each so I got a taste of that life before I had to quit and I must say that you have to suck it up and help her more! She's probably working harder than I was. Do what you have to do; eat more healthy, take vitamin drops, take ginseng, drink coffee or green tea but your wife is sinking and she didn't have those kids alone. Many women do what she does in addition to having a full time job outside of the home and they're unable to prioritize they're downtime after work because they don't have a choice, but if they can do it, you can do it, too. Having that many children is work, and you being the breadwinner doesn't exempt you from that work. Unfortunately, raising your children has to be prioritized, not your downtime. It will get easier as they grow, but for now help your wife a lot more than you are before she runs out of steam. I don't like to compare but since I've done both in my lifetime I'll tell you that I worked harder at home than I did at work, and I excelled at my job and have the awards and commendations to prove it. My manager cried when I left. I can assure you that with as hard as I know you're working, she's working harder. If you were to trade places for two weeks you'd beg to go back to work, believe me! You have a little time before #4 arrives, so start your energy supplements or whatever and start prioritizing helping your wife with the kids when you get home and start now; being largely pregnant with young children to raise will be even harder for her. I'd say get hire some help if you could afford it, but if you can't please step up!", "So she works (and her labor is essential for your business), manages three kids while pregnant with a fourth, and you\u2019re mad because your priority when you get home is to chill.

No, there is no nap time, much less multiple naptimes. \n\nAnd in my experience, the vast majority of people who don't take lunchbreaks in a high stress work environment on a regular basis (not a one-off super busy day) are voluntarily choosing to work through lunch and could take one if they actually made it a priority. What were you doing today that was so critical that you couldn't send that email off 15 minutes later, or tell the person IM'ing you that you'll ping them in 20, or tell the people in whatever meeting was during the lunch hour that you would be eating a sandwich during it?", "I doubt three four year olds are napping much at all, much less AT THE SAME TIME (what would be required for a \"break\"). Also, Naptime isn't breaktime.... It's \"me time to do the laundry.\"", "Multiple naptimes at 4?? No lol.", "That is such a good description! My second is four and once again I'm left wondering if this little human is broken. Spoiler: he's not, being four just sucks.", "We called them that too which is why both kids started kindergarten at just past their fifth birthday. Their brains needed more stimulation than I could give them after working full time.", "I have two kids in their 20s, when they're home, they're always coming into the bathroom to talk to me.", "I love you so much for this comment! My parrot comes with me to the bathroom every single time, lolllll!", "I think that\u2019s intentional.", "I\u2019ll lay you even money she didn\u2019t want to but he whinges and moans and gets all passive aggressive when he doesn\u2019t get it that it\u2019s easier to just get it over with than have to listen to the equivalent of a 4th child throwing a tantrum. I wish I could say I wasn\u2019t speaking from experience.", "Makes sense - I do think the extra time is still a valid concern. The longer somebody is open during surgery, the more chance for complication there is, but I will definitely listen to people who know about recovery time. The best bet would still be OP getting a vasectomy while she's pregnant because you generally can't get double pregnant.", "Her benefits sound awful", "You're right, Mom needs a break every day when dad gets home. Good healthy balance and doesn't minimize the work the dad is doing either.", "When your children are 3 or 4 they should be able to participate in household chores.\n\nI have a 1 year old and he stands at the sink with me on a step stool, albeit he doesn't wash them yet lol but regardless I am able to get household work done with my child. When he naps and I'm home on the weekend it sure seems like break time for me and his mom.\n\nI get it's different with multiple children but again the older ones should either be involved in the process, able to entertain themselves at times or in school for a good chunk of the day. \n\nThings don't have to be so difficult.", "My mom did that well into her 50s for the same reason, lol!", "Lmao I live in the country with no traffic and he has a doggy door. \n\nHe also guards me in the garden, against the summer people who are loading their van to go to work in the morning.\ud83d\ude44\n\nHe's ridiculous. Especially considering the only thing he can guard is their ankles and I can scoop him up and cage him in a bucket should I desire\ud83e\udd23", "Yes, it is. I'm pointing out how ridiculous it is and how little he sees his kids with that 'arrangement'.", "Totally.  My husband got a vasectomy right before Valentine's Day once we decided we were 2 and done.  I like to joke that it was the best Valentine's gift he ever gave me and we had our first date on Valentine's Day and he proposed on our 5th Valentine's Day together.  He thought the surgery was no big deal and went to work the next day.  He didn't even need to use the ice pack they gave him.", "I'm really sorry, my bestie was outright forced before she escaped her relationship, sadly he even took advantage of an absence seizure at the end.", "The number of times he said \"touched out\" was too damn high.", "Lol!!! One is very different than three smdh.", "What older ones? All their kids are the same age. Generally what happens with twins and triplets", "I'd hate to be the janitor that has to clean that empty floor that you poop on. Have you considered a toilet?", "You picked a good egg <3", "Oh my God, there are no words.", "Not only is one different from three, one 1-year-old is so different than three four year olds! Four is hard!", "Don't worry I'm a stoned redditor, wasn't paying attention to the details that closely.\n\nAt the end of the day balance is needed for both parents.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude02", "Absolutely no saltiness or low tolerance and distrust for men acting like this guy to their spouses here whatsoever /s"]}
