I told her that everything of her sons was in the garage and that my sister had been the one to pack everything herself so there was no need for her to into the house and if she tried I wasn't afraid to call the police on her. She argued with me for 15 minutes before told her \"there is all of his s**t, pack it and go before I throw a lit match in it\" and went inside (locking my door behind me).\n\nShe eventually left with all of the stuff and apparently called my sister and complained since I just got off of the phone to her.
