I said don't forget to leave me that in your will. She said, \"oh don't worry you're getting everything.\" I laughed because I thought she was joking. She wasn't I'm the sole heiress in their will. Her kids were pissed! They came up to me when I was getting in my car and told me they knew what I was doing and I should be ashamed. I told them they're the ones who should feel shame. They live their lives as if they don't have parents. They all go to church together and have a family dinner every week without inviting them. They go on yearly family vacations without them.

Mary has always wanted to go to Spain and John has always wanted to go to Argentina. So after months of convincing them, they agreed.

Also, they have to die and they\u2019re relatively young old people. So you\u2019d be way way better off to act like you\u2019re not getting anything from them. Work hard save money and pay off your own debts. As Janice Joplin said buy your own Mercedes Benz. Then if and when you inherit anything you will have demonstrated thst you don\u2019t need the money and the kids will realize that their parents really did just want you to have the money. There is something called \u201calienation of affection\u201d in which you could be accused of getting an inheritance by fraud but as long as you don\u2019t meddle in their finances you likely won\u2019t be accused of this. So technically you shouldn\u2019t be advising them about money period. I\u2019d tell them that you don\u2019t want to be involved in their money decisions but you love them dearly and if they want to leave you money you would be honored. I had a similar situation with a family friend and I made sure she knew I didn\u2019t want to inherit from her because I did what I did for her out of love. And I wanted her family to know that. I spoke at her funeral and her love and care were my reward. No one owes you an inheritance ever.

You have only known then for the past 17 years of their late adult life (when their children awere also at least young adults if not older). \nIt is very much possible that the children had a good reason for going NC with their parents. It is rear that all the children distance them selfs from their parents if there wasn't some long lasting resentmant towards them. \n\nI still think you personaly are not the AH, because what ever happend or didn't, it happend before you.", "I thought it was rich that they said their parents are wasting the money by traveling.

Focus on the amazing relationship you have with your \"adopted\" grandparents. You are 100% doing the right thing in encouraging them to spend their money on themselves, because it is their money. Inheritance is something that occurs after death not before, their children aren't entitled to any of it. And they're wrong on the court thing, that's not how wills work lmao.
