No she didn't call everyone back and say it was her mistake.\n\nNow WE are bullying YOU to let her back into YOUR house.   You're horrible!  Let her in your house because we demand it!", "I asked chatgp what it thought and here is exactly what it said \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" it  is difficult to say who is wrong in this situation without more information. It appears that Kelly accused Laura of stealing her airpods without any evidence, which was unfair to Laura. At the same time, it seems that you reacted strongly and may have overreacted by banning Kelly from your home. It may be helpful to try to understand why Kelly acted the way she did, and to have a calm conversation with her about the incident. It may also be helpful to talk to your siblings about their concerns and to try to find a way to move forward.\"\n\nand this is copied word to word.", "NTA. She jumped reflexively to an assumption (seemingly purely because Laura is a teenager) and spread that slander around the family. She caused a heck of a lot of drama for no reason, and it's not bullying to decide you don't need to give her another excuse to create drama with your family at the centre.\n\nThe bare minimum for Kelly being allowed back into your house should be a solid apology from her to Laura, and her calling round to admit her mistake to all the same members in the extended family that she previously slandered you and Laura to. Not \"whoops, haha, isn't this funny that I've spent the last few days being horrible to you!\"", "NTA.  Not only did Kelly wrongly accuse your daughter of being a thief, she told the whole family Laura was a thief.  This is vile  Feel free to cut her out of the family.  As for the siblings who are mad at you, perhaps you could tell their friends and neighbors that their children are thieves who stole your air pods and see how long it takes them to figure out that you aren't bullying Kelly.", "NTA\n\nUnless Kelly goes and corrects the misinformation to everyone she spread it to, I wouldn't consider attempting to talk or repair the damaged relationship. And even with that, she would have to do some serious atoning before I'd be comfortable having her around my kid, let alone in my house.", "NTA  \n\n\nDoesn't sound like she apologized or shown any remorse for what she did. And I would insist that she reaches out to all that extended family to say how she was wrong before you even consider letting her in your house. Maybe buy your daughter some airpods as an apology.", "NTA it was bad enough she jumped to blaming your daughter, but then she went and bad mouthed her to the family. Has she called them to clear your daughters name? I bet not", "Nta. Not only did she instigate more drama with extended family, but she demanded you guys buy her a replacement when she wasn't even sure. Her lack of accountability after finding them was definitely not a good sign. Bullying her? She should consider this a lesson learned.", "NOPE OP=NTA\n\nFeel free to explain that Kelly can't come back into your house, because she might find cause to slander(and/or libel if there were text messages/posts involved) your daughter again and next time it could have more serious consequences than just the family believing Kelly's unfounded/unproven accusations.  \n\nThis is for both their sakes, because next time Kelly might cause legal trouble based on her accusations and You might have to take legal action based on her accusations.\n\nPS: SAVE all text messages/conversations that took place regarding these accusations INCLUDING Kelly's text that she found the AIRPODS in her car.  Make it clear that if she ever again slanders your daughter again, you will look at taking action. \n\nKelly needs to NOT find this funny.  Your daughter could/might be looked at more suspiciously by people who heard Kelly's accusations and be more willing to believe she's guilty if a \"crime\" happens in her vicinity.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right: Protect your daughter from that AH.", "Kelly is a jerk. NTA.", "Nta so they think it's ok they she blamed your daughter of stealing even tho she had no proof. That she called a child a thief and a liar. I'm sure there wasn't even a public apology. You dont need that kind of negativity in y'alls home", "NTA. It's funny she is crying bullying when she bullied a child. \ud83d\ude20", ">Now my siblings are mad at me for banning Kelly from my house and said I'm being horrible and bullying her.\n\nNTA. \n\nKelly slandered your daughter and spread unfounded lies about her which was horrible and might I add, bullying, yet you standing up for your daughter after the truth came out is what's wrong to them? They're the ones enabling bad behavior and allowing an adult to bully a child. \n\nOnce again, NTA and good on you for having your daughter's back.", "NTA", "NTA!!! If it were me I would go so far as saying anyone who defends your niece also shouldn\u2019t be allowed in your home because they clearly can\u2019t be trusted", "AirPods are on the find My network, NTA she could have easily just looked to see where the phone last say them and been shown they where in the car, or in that area.", "NTA. \n\n\nFunny thing about the consequences of our actions - they dont always turn out the way we like. \n\n\nThat was disgusting behavior by your niece. And why would anyone want someone like that in their house that will jump to such a conclusion so quickly without even looking everywhere first.\n\n\nStrange that your siblings had ZERO issue in her falsely accusing your daughter but has an issue with you not tolerating her malicious behavior.", "NTA, not only did your niece accuse your daughter of stealing but also went around telling everyone in the family. Unless she does a full apology to your daughter face to face and in front of everyone she told AND make amends to your daughter, you shouldn't let her in your house EVER.", "NTA standing up for your teenage daughter does not immediately make you a bully to your adult niece. In this instance your niece is the bully and I'm thankful you stood up for your kiddo.", "Nooo, NTA. In my opinion, the apology needs to be as public as the accusation. A nasty piece of work.", "NTA. I hate people like this on principle and wouldn't have them in my house, either. If she'd rung up while looking thoroughly to ASK, that's one thing. Hurling accusations to all and sundry is something else, especially when you don't know for sure.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s 26 accusing someone of stealing is slander and she should know better. Playing it off as a joke is never going to go down well. \n\nBanning her from the house is also unhelpful. \n\nInstead perhaps you can suggest how she can make amends to you and Laura like a heartfelt apology and taking Laura for coffee or to get her nails done or something fun in order to rebuild goodwill and connection between them.", "Even if she had apologized it is fine to never allow her in your home ever again. She had no right to ask for replacement or slander your daughter without any proof. She is a careless, irresponsible and untrustworthy adult and not safe to be around at all for your kid. NTA", "She also told the whole family right away.", "Bullying a 26 yo woman who harassed a teenager. Um, I don't think what OP did was bullying, but the reaction was justified. If the woman had called and sincerely apologized for her mistake, maybe she could be forgiven. But she laughed it off. She got what she deserved. NTA.", "Thought so too.", "> Kelly even went around telling all our extended family that Laura stole her thing and that shes a liar and a thief and I'm enabling it.\n\nA public, heartfelt apology to OP's daughter is barely the beginning if Kelly wants to make amends.", "She probably let them die at OP\u2019s house and saw that as the last location. Now, does that mean the daughter stole? of course not. It would\u2019ve been way more reasonable to say \u201chey lemme know if you find my AirPods they might be in your house\u201d", "Didn\u2019t know that!", "THAT.", "No, public apologies serve to make a show for others, not to make right a wrong. Kelly needs to make a personal direct apology to OP\u2019s daughter and a public retraction of her accusations and maligning of OP\u2019s daughter.", "She did hurt someone with her lies."]}
