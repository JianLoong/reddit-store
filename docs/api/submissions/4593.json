After slandering her and you in front, Kelly is clearly not only an AH, but an AH because her brother says you're \"terrible\" and a \"bully.\"", "I'd be worried the next time she misplaces something, she'd blame OP's daughter again.", "Seriously. \"hey auntie, have you seen an extra pair of airpods around? I can't find mine and I think I had them when I was visiting\"", "AND spread that mess throughout the family. Did she agree to contact everyone she told this too, and explain your daughter is innocent.   \n\n\nHas she apologized to your daughter?   \n\n\nUnless your daughter is super comfortable with returning to status quo without an apology and restoring her reputation, she is the one to decide what level of interaction with her cousin is appropriate. You gave her that by banning home visits. You\u2019ll have to do some work shielding her once the family sees you\u2019re not budget, because they will start turning their attention to her. They\u2019ll bully and guilt-trip her.   \n\n\nYou\u2019re doing just fine. Keep standing in front of your daughter, and reply to any inquiries that it\u2019s your decision right now to limit interaction.", "It's like my sister. Crazy people do that", ">Until Kelly has called every person in the family retracting her slander against your daughter and makes a public post proclaiming your daughter's innocence she can pound sand. I wouldn't trust her in your home for a very long time.\n\nKelly can't un-ring the bell, she has no way of knowing how many people those family members told about their \"thief cousin\". Kelly sounds really awful and entitled, and the way OP's family members are making excuses for her shows how she got that way.", "> Her parents are actually enabling her behavior.\n\nHow did you figure that?", "Ikr? Even I really though that family member stole from me, I'd approach in poiltnes first. \nSomething like \"maybe you took them by accident?\"", "OP see this comment. This is a completely valid reason. It is a major accusation \n\nMoreover, my family has tried entertaining self invited accusers in our house. It didn\u2019t go well.\n\nNTA", "I like this, I am going with ESH. A ban is too harsh for an immature squabble. Other ways to express your displeasure with Kelly without a down right ban.", "She\u2019s not young enough to use that as an excuse, especially when she accused a literal child of theft", "Niece.", "Immaturity still stands", "I was gonna say that! That is how I found my phone in 1 of 3 cow fields, so it is pretty darn good! I wonder if Kelly kicked off in the hopes of getting the money, then when that didn\u2019t work had to \u2018find\u2019 the AirPod so she could use them again.", "This is the part that got me confused? What happened with the find my app? Why does the story make no mention of it? Very confusing.", "Yep. Every time I go to lunch and leave my AirPods in my office the notice pops up on my phone saying I have left them behind.  Like I know that but thank you.", "Exactly! Just use the Find My app, she obviously could have found them immediately but chose to spin this story instead.", "This is the comment I was looking for. The first thing I do when I can\u2019t find my AirPods or just a single Airpod is go to the findmy app. OP NTA", "Yup, trust is now broken. Acting like OP's trying to cut her out of the family when she went around spreading lies with zero proof is ridiculous, just like not checking her damn car before accusing her cousin. OP's daughter shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable in her own home. NTA, OP. Sounds like your daughter can trust you to have her back.", "Yeah, she had a chance to redeem herself by at least apologizing to the daughter after finding the pods, but by not doing so, she ruined any chance she had and can be rightfully banned", "OP is being accused by her siblings - one of whom will be Kelly's parent - of bullying Kelly when OP is simply enforcing reasonable consequences. A good parent - even as a parent to an adult - would understand that OP would not want someone in their home who will a) leap straight to accusing their teenage daughter of being a thief over a misplaced item (rather than the more reasonable \"hey, I can't find them, did I leave them at yours?\"), b) drag the drama all across social media and to wider family to get them all mad at OP's teenage daughter and c) on finding the misplaced item, expects OP to laugh off such poor treatment of their teenage daughter.\n\nA good parent would wholly support OP protecting their daughter and tell Kelly she got the consequences of her actions. All Kelly is learning in this case is that she can stir up all of this drama and make someone else the bad guy, and most of the family will believe her when she cries victim", "Calling the OP a bully rather than teaching their daughter that she was 10 fold wrong.", "First thing I thought too. Someone I knew had done that before though lol,", "I think a better choice than young would be immature.\n\nEdit: NTA", "I misplaced mine in my house, and the app guided me right to the linen closet. Unfortunately it could not explain why I put them there.", "That would still not be an excuse", "OP is entitled to ban someone from their own home if she doesn't feel comfortable with that said someone. Is not a \"punishment, poor her! She just slandered a teen and never apologized for her own irresponsibility and mistake!\", is just the consequences of her own actions. \nOP NTA, and you own a grown woman nothing, but you should protect your child form this kind of people.", "I mean they serve to clean the daughter's name given that she accused her to all the family", "I think both are appropriate. Kelly needs to be the one who informs everyone that she jumped to conclusions and was wrong.", "I definitely agree with you, I was just trying to phrase it more accurately. One can be mature and young, or (in this case) an immature adult.", "AXE", "THESE", "WHAT?", "WHO", "WHERE"]}
