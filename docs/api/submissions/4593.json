Literally 15 minutes at home - all grownups are in and out bring bags in while niece is inside and I saw her going in my room. I asked her why are you in my room as everyone else was in and out, so they saw me asking. She said oh nothing, not a real response but hmm? So I asked her to close my door. I didn\u2019t go out anymore cos sadly this aint my first rodeo but I didn\u2019t accuse anyone, just had my radar up. I stayed in kitchen and kept talking to niece about food prep. Hubby had some calls and finally when done came in to get his purchase and lo and behold! Finds brand new case is empty of items and phone wire is missing which was right on top of bag as he charged his new phone in car with the new charger wire (the old wire didn\u2019t work on newest iphone). He going crazy going thru all bags. I said no - the first thing we did was pass that ATT bag to me, put the charger wire on top and I took it to my room. The only other person in the room was NIECE. So where is it I ask my niece. She is shocked then looks at her mom (hubbys sis) and says Ma I didn\u2019t take anything. So I say cool, empty your pockets, shake your bra. Take off your sneakers shake em out. Ma - look in her jacket. \nMa refused. Was highly offended. I told her mom listen think what you want you\u2019re not helping Niece by denying she has a problem.
