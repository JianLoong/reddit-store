My parents had been saving up for the last year to pay for my sisters braces. Today my dad decide to give my sister her Christmas present early. When I gave her the money she thought parents were letting her buy whatever she wanted but when my dad told her it was for her braces she burst into tears. She started to tell my parents that\u2019s not what she wanted for Christmas and that she wanted something else. So my dad decided to give her $200 out of the original grand to let her buy whatever she wanted and the rest would go towards her braces. My dad didn\u2019t understand why she was upset since she was the same one who was complaining to my dad a month ago about wanting to get braces. \n\nAfter we were done talking I went upstairs with her and called her an asshole. I told her it wasn\u2019t fair to our parents who had been working their butts off to save the money in the first place especially in this economy. I explained to her that even if she didn\u2019t like what the money was going towards she should\u2019ve just been grateful for it and left it at that to not make my parents feel bad. When I said all this to her she started to cry even more and ran into the bathroom. When I try taking to her she ignores me and when I go to her room she tells me to get out. Honestly I am not apologizing to her regardless because after everything happened my mom came to me saying she felt upset at my sister because she doesn\u2019t know how hard it was to save when we\u2019re just getting by. AITA?\n\nEDIT: few things to clear up, my sister has WANTED and NEEDED braces for a while now but we could never afford it. The ESTIMATED cost for her braces is about 5 grand and our insurance will not cover anything. I haven\u2019t received any birthday gifts or Christmas gifts because ik that\u2019s something my parents can not afford rn and that why I was so upset when she said this wasn\u2019t what she wanted but this is all we had. I\u2019ve seen a few comments saying to leave but if my parents are in a bad financial place what makes you think I\u2019m in an even better place to leave financially? Also the gifts she wanted for Christmas were more than $200 so that\u2019s why I believe my dad gave her the $200 in the first place but I\u2019m not sure", "created_utc": 1700870637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18366nl/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_shes_in_the_wrong/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I grew up poor, so yes, getting braces for Christmas would've been a gift we got. Mom would've been working all year to save up for it. We always said thank you and we're grateful for it, but also disappointed too. It's a normal human reaction. \n\nYour parents suck, because it is a crappy gift. Don't think they should've given her the money. Just tell her \"hey we finally have the cash to get you braces\". Trust me, I get they worked hard for it and thought she would be excited, but unfortunately it didn't go as planned.\n\nYour sister sucks, because her reaction was a bit over the top at 14. She's not a little kid where she doesn't understand it. Yes, we can say she should've behaved differently and be grateful, but I truly understand her disappointment. It was a sucky gift whether she is spoiled or not (unfortunately that is a subjective opinion). \n\nAnd you suck, because you just should've stayed out of it. I totally get your point you were trying to make to her and thought you were being a defender of your parents, but it wasn't needed as they are able to defend themselves. You should've waited until she wasn't upset or if she asked you for your opinion on that matter. Then you could've said \"yeah it was a sucky gift , but mom and dad worked hard to save up the cash for you and were excited to give it to you.\" She could've context clued it together on her own.", "INFO: Does she actually need braces?\n\nEdit; YTA I\u2019ve read the comment that says she does need them so really yeah you\u2019re parents shouldn\u2019t of made it a Christmas gift or a gift at all.

Personally, I think it was rather shitty for your father give your sister money for Christmas only to tell her, it's not for her, it's for her braces. I didn't make my children pay for the dental or orthodontic care or try to pass off my responsibilities as a parent as a gift.", "For this family it seems that braces are a priority snd only so much money to go around.  The 19 yo is understanding what her parents have gone thru to save this money. 14 yo is not realizing what they did for the money. She wants presents , where 19 yo has gone without. It\u2019s not our place to determine what they can or can\u2019t afford. Is it an ideal Christmas gift?  I guess for some it would be.  Not every family has extra money just because it\u2019s christmas. They saved for her braces.  19 yo could do better trying to explain to her sister. But you can\u2019t force gratitude.  14 yo needs to understand her families limits and appreciate what they can do.  Maybe in the future the family can set up a Christmas account.

Older siblings almost always think their younger siblings are spoiled brats. Often it's because kids at younger ages **are** spoiled brats. And the older kid probably was too at that age. But in addition, parents often become **more relaxed** in their parenting style, so they may really be less harsh and more flexible with younger kids. This annoys the older kids, since they feel it's unfair, even if the updated style is better parenting. (Source: I am an oldest child and I had these feelings. Now that I'm older, and a parent, I see things differently.)", "She's 14 years old.

You should all just chill, tempers will cool down and it will be fine.", "YTA and so are your parents. Medical care is something that decent parents provide for their kids. It\u2019s not a gift or an extra.", "I'm so sorry everyone is downvoting you. I understand what you are going through.

No. And it is not one she will appreciate for many many years but it is one that she WILL appreciate later in life.\n\nWith the cost of living right now, sometimes the fun stuff goes by the wayside to make room for the necessities.

Sometimes they masquerade like it, but they are often petulant children who are more than happy to take and whine when they don't get more.

That's just something a parent should do.", "NTA. Whoever is calling her an asshole clearly didn't grow up in a low income household with a spoiled sibling. I did and I remember my parents doing the absolute most for us and being heartbroken when my sister behaved a certain way.  14 is old enough to grasp a certain amount of the complexities of your situation, at the very least know about your parents financial struggles.

I was able to pay for my own braces at 27.  \n\nI broke the cycle though, and was able to pay for my kiddos braces and palate expander which she already needed by age 9.  Sometimes when I see her gorgeous smile, I think of my mom's parenting failures (mom was poor by choice).", "Still expensive. The sister should appreciate how hard the parents are working to get her what she needs.", "Bingo. We were broke and I needed new winter tires one year. I didn\u2019t expect much at all for Christmas and was happy with a card and a meal with my family. My mom worked her butt off and got me tires for my car. They were about $600, damn right things you need are a good gift, especially when resources are limited. We are doing better now and I love getting socks and underwear every year, my family loves knowing they haven\u2019t wasted money on crap I don\u2019t need and have helped me in a real way because I do need it. Anyone who\u2019s ever had to scrimp and save for needed things knows what a gift that actually is.", "Seriously! My braces weren't technically a \"medical need\" because I could eat and drink despite my jacked up teeth. My mouth looked like some child's drawing of a fanged beast, but insurance didn't cover fixing it. My parents busted their fucking asses to cover my dental work. Headgear, retainers to adjust my jaw shape, braces, and more retainers. Christmas was...lean for those years, as was my birthday. But I could actually SMILE at the end of it and not hate how I looked. I was younger than OP's sister and I understood the sacrifices they made to fix my teeth. Was I sad on the inside that I basically wasn't going to get anything for years? Obviously. But I understood and I did my best to never show it.", "Exactly. Some teens are extremely bratty and selfish. Even if it was a need over a want that doesn\u2019t make braces any less expensive. Daughter should show gratitude and not act like a petulant child when she received something she wants. Though this is par for some teenage behavior it needs to be a lesson learned to be grateful she even gets presents.", "I agree. And something tells me this wasn't the first time a fit was thrown.   \n\n\nBut I also agree that first giving her a grand and then tell her \"Nope, it's not for you to spend on whatever, it's for braces\" is kind of a shitty thing to do. And why on earth would they do this a month before christmas?   \n\n\nBut OP is NTA. She is trying to teach her sister to be grateful instead of a brat with a fit whenever she doesn't get what she wants.", "This.  OP mentions that the parents worked hard for this.  I'm sure they'd rather keep the $1000 for other things instead.", "I feel this though my issues were worst after braces. They completely stripped my enamel off my teeth. Add in my severe gi issues and I have lost all by five of my teeth and now have dentures in my 30s. I very much agree that having bad teeth affects your self esteem and I personally would love if I was given a present to have good looking teeth.", "There's many issues that can arise with crooked teeth and overbites and underbites. Braces that are needed are for those cases where they will cause problems.", "I get that. I still think OP is NTA. i can concede that in a typical situation braces aren\u2019t a gift bc they\u2019re necessary. however, a lot of families can\u2019t afford braces AND presents. i grew up in a family who couldn\u2019t and because of that i never got braces. i think OP was right to call the sibling out for being ungrateful. i get the sibling is young and maybe this is something they\u2019ve never experienced but they have to learn sometime. i think that sometimes kids just have to accept that it\u2019s either gifts/ things they want OR things they need like braces. i think it\u2019s a sucky situation for everyone :( no parent wants to have to choose between gifts and braces and no kid wants to have to make that choice, especially so young.", "Moving out might not be an option. But that doesn't make it something people should assume based on your *parents* finances. Weird to think they would. Or that your *parents* financial situation would effect if you can get a job to support yourself (your work load of course might, but not how much money your parents have)", "Does your school not offer jobs on campus?", "Wow, I feel really sorry for you two. You were forced to be the parent for your small sis. That's really not fair for either of you. \n\nYou shouldn't hesitate to reach out to any kind of support you can get: relatives you trust, teachers, even cps if you feel overwhelmed with the responsibility. \n\nNot getting anything from your parents since you were 15 is incredibly sad. I hope that didn't include clothes and food and school necessities. Because your parents are 100% responsible for providing for you and your sister. Including medical bills. \n\nThe fact you had to hide the money for your dad tells me that your parents don't have their financials figured out or maybe worse. Do you have your own bank account? One that you parents cannot access? \n\nIf not: get one! (I get the feeling you have to protect your money from your mom or so).", "It doesn\u2019t help that those comments are more than likely from children themselves.", "Ortho recommended 2 \u201cphases\u201d of braces for my son when he was in 3rd grade. 3rd grade! My brother & myself both had braces growing up & his were a more serious need than mine but even then, there weren\u2019t 2 phases. Basically, we would have to pay for 2 sets of braces for my son! It didn\u2019t make sense to us to do any of this on baby teeth and then of course covid came so that stalled everything. At a later dentist appt, the dentist said he didn\u2019t think my son needed them until he was older & his adult teeth were grown in. Now he\u2019s 12 & we\u2019re going to reevaluate. The \u201cphased\u201d braces felt a bit like a money making scheme to me. His teeth are overcrowded but have straightened out a bit as he grew. He has not complained of pain except the usual when losing or growing in teeth. Really it\u2019s just the 2 top front teeth overlapping a bit at this point.", "Congrats! I know breaking the cycle is no easy feat. I managed to break it myself through some luck. It must've been so satisfying to be able to provide for your daughter.", "It's something the sister had been wanting though, and even if it doesn't cover the full cost, it's still money they're putting aside just for her. I think she should understand that you can get cheap things or get something that'll help long term (and emphasis on the fact that she wants them). I definitely understand that it must be disappointing but you can be disappointed and still grateful. OP said that as gifts once they got nothing while their sister got a TV, so I'm definitely not sympathizing as much with the sister tbh \ud83d\ude2dthough I do think everyone is in the wrong to an extent", "As the previous poster said, a lot of dentists will say braces are \"needed\" but really just mean it for aesthetic reasons.", "She's 14 no 3?!?! Hello!!! \n\nNTA op  your parents made a mistake giving her the money but I assume they were happy to have managed to save it which is why I wouldn't call them ah either.", "For a teenager tired of being called \"Bucky beaver\" or being asked if you can open bottles with those teeth, orthodontia can be a fabulous gift and thirteen is not too young to understand and appreciate it.", "That is your view point. Others might differ. Just because it is a need doesn\u2019t make it any less expensive and it might not be a need but for cosmetic reasons.  The daughter is old enough to understand that things are expensive and she should show gratitude. Communication could have been better though.", "That sucks, I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. I had to have two jaw surgeries as an adult (as well as braces) that might have been able to be avoided had I seen an orthodontist as a young child. The braces did damage my teeth and I\u2019ve had to have some root canals and crowns, but I still feel like having my bite fixed was worth it.", "That is the real problem.  But calling a 14 year old selfish abs entitled is more fun I guess. Smh", "Someone crying after acting like an ass is not a shield.", "No I already have a job as an intern at an engineering firm but I don\u2019t get paid much and I try to help out financially when I can", "YEP that's pretty much what my orthodontist said too. He wanted to do several things to prepare for braces, but those things just messed things up even more. Then when it was actually time for braces, my parents couldn't afford it anymore due to other circumstances so I just got stuck with fucked up teeth. I'm now 36 and thinking about braces because my teeth are embarrassing and are so crooked that it causes jaw pain.      \n\nMy cousin went to the same orthodontist and was told the same thing, but they got a second opinion and were told to wait. My parents feel bad that they never got a second opinion and just did whatever the first guy said.    \n\nDon't do orthodontic work on your kids until after their adult teeth have grown in!!!", "Yeah my braces destroyed my teeth as well. Stripped enamel off my teeth and I have had so much work done. I also have massive gi issues and that sealed the deal for my teeth. I ish I could go back and say no. This was back in 99/ 2000 so I hope braces have gotten better for kids.", "The OP explains, in caps, that the sister NEEDS braces. So it's absolutely not just something she has been wanting.\n\nAnd your follow up about how she should understand that you can get cheap things? I literally said it would be better to give **nothing** than some money then say \"actually it's not really a gift its part of the contribution towards your medical need\". That's a cruel switch and bait, not something to be grateful for. If you can't afford a gift just don't give a gift.", " Mine were necessary and I would absolutely not want them for a Christmas present.", "It's not a gift when it is a medical need. OP states IN CAPS that it is a NEED", "K don't think a child should shw gratitude for their parents doing their job - providing for her and making sure her needs are met. Making sure she is healthy is a parents responsibility. If you don't wsnt to pay for your childs croocked teeth or want yhor children to be thankful for you meeting their *needs*, then ypu shouldn't have children, it's as easy as that.\n\nMeeting a need isn't a *gift*, especially not for a child. The daughter *is* old enough to unserstand things are expensiv, so she is old enough to understand there is no money for a big gift. Gifting her a game or sonething for 20 bucks would still be a decent gift, it would be even if her parents were shitting money. But a neccessity is not a gift.\n\nAnd holding the money over her head and basically \"no christmas because we pay enough for merting your medical needs\" is just cruel.", "Yikes. I am sorry about that as well. That sounds rough. I would not recommend braces if just for cosmetic reasons as they do so much damage to your teeth. I defn see why it was worth it to you. Hope it is better for you now!", "I feel this. As someone who has had horrible teeth and chronic severe gi issues that will be a life long issues I do agree. I am in debt by thousands of dollars so I can have some sort of quality of life. I have had surgery to try to help and it was thousands upon thousands of dollars. The sad fact if life in the US is they you are screwed if you have medical problems. Without insurance you are screwed and even with insurance you can be screwed. I have medicine that I have to take several times a day to live. It is over $6000.00 a month. For ONE medicine. I am on several. Sorry I got off on a tangent but I hate that in the US you can lose everything with medical debt.", "While I\u2019d still say you didn\u2019t handle it great in the moment, it sounds like your folks have make some really odd choices. I\u2019m guessing there is a lot more context here.", "That's good. My advice (if you're in the US) is to save as much as possible to buy a car and afford insurance as once you have transportation everything is easier including getting a higher paid job. I would also instead of getting mad at your sister, explain the situation and encourage her to make her own money as she is old enough. At 14 I had an after school snack shop I ran out of my locker, I also would have kids buy quesadillas from me I would wrap them in plastic wrap and paper plates and at lunch sell them to the kids in the teachers class that let them use the microwave, and there are many other things I would do to get money. It sounds to me like she needs honesty and encouragement to start supporting herself, this is the reality for poor kids.", "What brother? OP is her sister.", "Yeah I totally understand that! Honestly as I said I think everyone is somewhat at fault like it sucks for everyone involved. I do think they should have a family discussion so that stuff like OP blowing up at the sister doesn't happen again and that the sister understands better but the parents sympathize with her as well. You're right though it's a perspective I didn't think too much about (the medical contribution thing) and I'm sure that sucks", "Hello??? It's not \"no christmas because we pay enough for meeting your medical needs\", it's \"here, we saved our asses off for you to get braces, but now we dont have enough for a christmas present for you.\"", "I was told I needed braces when I was younger her because a few of my teeth are not straight. Did I get them? No. Because my mom was a single parent of two with zero help from our sperm donors. Christmas is about gifting things that your children need. Wants are a luxury and if I as a parent had saved that much money and neglected my other child\u2019s needs by not being able to give them something small as a gift on their birthday I would expect them to be hurt just as the OP was. Everyone is sacrificing for one person who is old enough to understand and has seen it to turn around and be ungrateful. Dad shouldn\u2019t have even given the sister the $200. He should have split it between the two so the younger sister could see what gratitude looks like.", "Hard disagree. Braves are not essential and she wants the check. We are not talking about food. The child should be grateful. This is not food, water, shelter, etc. I wouldn\u2019t have done it the way they did it but yes she is 14 not four.  Fixing crooked teeth is not a NEED. The fourteen is acting like a BRAT. She is acting like a teen but needs to be taught gratitude. The fact that it took the parent some time to save shows that they are not flush with money.", "Hard disagree. Braves are not essential and she wants the check. We are not talking about food.

Braces are not food, water, shelter, etc. I guess parents should not give clothes at Christmas because they is a need. That is a TON of money to spend on braces and a lot of people are struggling to put food on the table. If it took them a while to save up then they are not obviously flush with its money. At 14, she should understand this and be grateful. Reddit users never disappoint.", "Yikes. I had a stomach emptying test that was just eating radioactive oatmeal and seeing how long it takes to move from my stomach via a machine. The whole cost of the test for 50k.
