My parents had been saving up for the last year to pay for my sisters braces. Today my dad decide to give my sister her Christmas present early. When I gave her the money she thought parents were letting her buy whatever she wanted but when my dad told her it was for her braces she burst into tears. She started to tell my parents that\u2019s not what she wanted for Christmas and that she wanted something else. So my dad decided to give her $200 out of the original grand to let her buy whatever she wanted and the rest would go towards her braces. My dad didn\u2019t understand why she was upset since she was the same one who was complaining to my dad a month ago about wanting to get braces. \n\nAfter we were done talking I went upstairs with her and called her an asshole. I told her it wasn\u2019t fair to our parents who had been working their butts off to save the money in the first place especially in this economy. I explained to her that even if she didn\u2019t like what the money was going towards she should\u2019ve just been grateful for it and left it at that to not make my parents feel bad. When I said all this to her she started to cry even more and ran into the bathroom. When I try taking to her she ignores me and when I go to her room she tells me to get out. Honestly I am not apologizing to her regardless because after everything happened my mom came to me saying she felt upset at my sister because she doesn\u2019t know how hard it was to save when we\u2019re just getting by. AITA?\n\nEDIT: few things to clear up, my sister has WANTED and NEEDED braces for a while now but we could never afford it. The ESTIMATED cost for her braces is about 5 grand and our insurance will not cover anything. I haven\u2019t received any birthday gifts or Christmas gifts because ik that\u2019s something my parents can not afford rn and that why I was so upset when she said this wasn\u2019t what she wanted but this is all we had. I\u2019ve seen a few comments saying to leave but if my parents are in a bad financial place what makes you think I\u2019m in an even better place to leave financially?

I grew up poor, so yes, getting braces for Christmas would've been a gift we got. Mom would've been working all year to save up for it. We always said thank you and we're grateful for it, but also disappointed too. It's a normal human reaction. \n\nYour parents suck, because it is a crappy gift. Don't think they should've given her the money. Just tell her \"hey we finally have the cash to get you braces\". Trust me, I get they worked hard for it and thought she would be excited, but unfortunately it didn't go as planned.\n\nYour sister sucks, because her reaction was a bit over the top at 14. She's not a little kid where she doesn't understand it. Yes, we can say she should've behaved differently and be grateful, but I truly understand her disappointment. It was a sucky gift whether she is spoiled or not (unfortunately that is a subjective opinion). \n\nAnd you suck, because you just should've stayed out of it. I totally get your point you were trying to make to her and thought you were being a defender of your parents, but it wasn't needed as they are able to defend themselves. You should've waited until she wasn't upset or if she asked you for your opinion on that matter. Then you could've said \"yeah it was a sucky gift , but mom and dad worked hard to save up the cash for you and were excited to give it to you.\" She could've context clued it together on her own.", "INFO: Does she actually need braces?\n\nEdit; YTA I\u2019ve read the comment that says she does need them so really yeah you\u2019re parents shouldn\u2019t of made it a Christmas gift or a gift at all. It\u2019s medical and no matter the price, it\u2019s something you have to do when you decide it have kids. It all comes with it.", "OP you need to edit your post because you comment that your sister NEEDS the braces, not that she wants them and that yalls parents knew for a while but couldn\u2019t afford them. \n\nSo yes YTA. Medical care when it is NEEDED is not a Christmas gift, or a birthday gift or a surprise. \n\nEveryone say N T A should see that comment before making judgement. 14 yr doesn\u2019t want them because she\u2019s in America and it\u2019s a \u201crequirement\u201d to have perfect teeth which by the way not everyone thinks that and there are cheaper ways to do it than braces.", "YTA Your sister is 14 years old. 14 year old don't think about the big picture. Personally, I think it was rather shitty for your father give your sister money for Christmas only to tell her, it's not for her, it's for her braces. I didn't make my children pay for the dental or orthodontic care or try to pass off my responsibilities as a parent as a gift.", "For this family it seems that braces are a priority snd only so much money to go around.  The 19 yo is understanding what her parents have gone thru to save this money. 14 yo is not realizing what they did for the money. She wants presents , where 19 yo has gone without. It\u2019s not our place to determine what they can or can\u2019t afford. Is it an ideal Christmas gift?  I guess for some it would be.  Not every family has extra money just because it\u2019s christmas. They saved for her braces.  19 yo could do better trying to explain to her sister. But you can\u2019t force gratitude.  14 yo needs to understand her families limits and appreciate what they can do.  Maybe in the future the family can set up a Christmas account. And family can quit spoiling her if money is so tight. Nothing worse than an entitled child growing into an entitled adult", "Yta wait\u2026.your parents gave her a medical procedure as a gift? Wtf plus she\u2019s a minor why would they give her money to pay for braces? Shes under their care, that is fully on them", "YTA. She's 14yo and I'm guessing she asked for braces because she needs them because something is wrong with her teeth that needs to be corrected. \n\nRegardless of how expensive it is, it shoudn't have been framed as a Christmas present. And I question how 'spoiled' she actually is if dental care is considered a luxury within your family.", "YTA\n\nMedical care **is** a shitty Christmas gift for a child.\n\nYour sister should get braces because *she needs them*. She should get a Christmas present because your family celebrates the holiday.\n\nAnd FFS, what fly-by-night operation will give you braces for just $1000, anyway? It should be *several times* that.", "YTA.\n\nYou might even be right, but it is **not your job** to parent your little sister. \n\nI have an observation. Older siblings almost always think their younger siblings are spoiled brats. Often it's because kids at younger ages **are** spoiled brats. And the older kid probably was too at that age. But in addition, parents often become **more relaxed** in their parenting style, so they may really be less harsh and more flexible with younger kids. This annoys the older kids, since they feel it's unfair, even if the updated style is better parenting. (Source: I am an oldest child and I had these feelings. Now that I'm older, and a parent, I see things differently.)", "She's 14 years old.  She's a child who is not old enough to completely get it, and your parents handled it poorly because while somebody might want braces, but most of us don't want them for our Christmas present. Cut her some slack.", "I agree with everyone else. 14 years old i would have been pretty disappointed with that. I got braces, and i know my parents worked hard for that, but i still got christmas.", "OP, i got a question\u2026 does your sister NEED braces or does she only WANT them?", "NAH.\n\nYou and your parents are understandably upset because it is a lot of money for you and you expected her to be grateful. She is understandably upset that she only got braces for Christmas, which don't really seem like a gift. You shouldn't give medical necessities to kids as gifts. You should all just chill, tempers will cool down and it will be fine.", "YTA and so are your parents. Medical care is something that decent parents provide for their kids. It\u2019s not a gift or an extra.", "I'm so sorry everyone is downvoting you. I understand what you are going through. Some kids just don't understand how hard it is nowadays to save and afford anything. They think money just grows in trees. Good luck. I hope eventually she will understand.", "NTA. \n\nBraces are medically necessary for many but insurance rarely covers it.\n\nIs it a FUN Christmas gift? No. And it is not one she will appreciate for many many years but it is one that she WILL appreciate later in life.\n\nWith the cost of living right now, sometimes the fun stuff goes by the wayside to make room for the necessities. The fact of the matter is, sometimes a need has to outweigh a want and this is likely the first time your sister has been smacked upside the head by the reality of her situation.", "She should be glad she is even getting braces so many familys cant afford that even with saving my family included. I need braces but we cant afford for me to get any and still pay the bills she should be grateful she has this opportunity", "Most often than not braces are cosmetic procedures. So if she didn\u2019t need them and just said she wanted it to she looks better, yes, it\u2019s a valid Christmas/birthday present. \n\nAnd a 14 year old is old enough to not throw a tantrum.", "NTA\n\nYou did what you should do as a big sister -- at the right time: support her, validate her, but also correct her and offer an \"objective\" view of what's right/wrong. It was CRAZY thinking for her to believe she was getting a free $1000, and while it was weird of your parents to give it to her, rather than just saving up and taking her to an orthodontist (I know of no child who got paid the money for their own braces - parents take you to a doctor!)\n\n14 yo's are not rational people. Sometimes they masquerade like it, but they are often petulant children who are more than happy to take and whine when they don't get more. They think it's endearing or cute or funn, and sometimes when called on it, over-react out of disappointment or shame. She's overreacting for attention - don't feed it.", "Braces are not a gift. That's just something a parent should do.", "NTA. Whoever is calling her an asshole clearly didn't grow up in a low income household with a spoiled sibling. I did and I remember my parents doing the absolute most for us and being heartbroken when my sister behaved a certain way.  14 is old enough to grasp a certain amount of the complexities of your situation, at the very least know about your parents financial struggles.  I got orthodontic treatment for my 16th birthday because I asked for it and really wanted it.  You can live without braces, they're almost always cosmetic but you can't live with a false, spoiled perception of the world you were born into.", "NTA.", "idk why ppl are saying braces are a medical need, they most definitely are not and they are extremely expensive. iv had them myself and if my parents payed for them for Christmas i\u2019d be happy  bc that\u2019s a lot of money and something they are doing for me\u2026. it\u2019s not really a need as much of a want so i\u2019m leaning towards NTA", "The fact that you call your sister spoiled for having braces is really telling. You see these braces as care while your sister, as a 14 year old, sees it as punishment. \n\nIt\u2019s not that big, but to your sister it\u2019s big. \n\nSomething that should be considered as physical care she must see as a present. \n\nAs an adult, I see it, as a 14 year old I would feel like I\u2019m being punished for having bad teeth genetically. \n\nAnd while my sibling receive something that makes them an instant gratification, my gift is pain in the present hoping for the future. It\u2019s not really a happy time for her either.", "Apparently yall health insurance is better than most. Please donate for the braces!!", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s unfortunate that as parents we aren\u2019t as open with our children as we should/want to be.

She sees braces as a need, and likely this is true.  \n\nGifts are not usually the NEEDS but WANTS.  \n\nI understand how your sister would feel cheated. The idea of going to school and saying that her gift was braces.  How would you like it if you broke your leg and your gift was crutches?\n\nSoftly YTA because all you see is the money that was spent on her. \n\n(Some family's budget is so tight that gifts may be practical and in the NEEDS catagory.

We all know how difficult teenage emotions can be.", "I wouldn\u2019t call getting braces a gift.

They should have given her some kind of symbolic gift that represented the braces and then added to it with some nice, affordable things that she could enjoy in the moment.

You chose to have kids, you provide for them, and they shouldn't have to clap like seals for it. \n\nYou seem like you are jealous of your sister and the gifts she gets which is valid, but don't pit yourself against your sister. If your parents didn't or aren't treating you equally, that is on them not on her. And you can't expect a 14 year old to be devlopmentally on par with you at 19. 5 years of life experience and brain development is a big deal and you might have been just as \"selfish\" when you were younger.

For her whole treatment it cost $5,000 and our insurance won\u2019t cover anything", "Lol someone likes the bold fonts. It's not unwarranted for an older sibling to correct a younger sibling in the least.", "I completely get what you're saying, but isn't it also kind of unfair to say that in her defence when OP gets absolutely nothing as gifts? 1000 for braces you want + need, even if not enough for the whole thing, should be met with gratitude I'd say bc she's old enough to at least understand hard work and gratitude a bit yk?", "It\u2019s both, she\u2019s needed them for a while but with our current financial situation my parents haven\u2019t had the money for them. Our dental insurance won\u2019t cover her treatment at all so it\u2019s about $5,000 from the estimate the doctor gave us", "Braces aren't always necessary to eat, talk, and function a basic life. It's a common American mindset to think you MUST have straight teeth - it's a luxury in some cases. NTA", "OP made it clear it was a medical need in her case.", "OP said they were a need. Braces can absolutely be a medical device if someone's teeth are growing in wrong.", "Exactly. Totally understand that it would be a shitty gift for most people, but if the parents are in a financial position where they can only afford either paying for braces or buying actual gifts the 14yo wants, then braces should be the priority.\n  \nEdit: why are people actually downvoting this \ud83d\udc80 if thats all the parents can afford, then thats all they can afford. They cant magically afford to give the 14 yo both braces and other gifts.", ">idk why ppl are saying braces are a medical need, they most definitely are not\n\nWhy write something wrong with so much conviction?\n\nBraces can and in a lot of cases are a medical need. Sometimes they are used to deal with immediate issues. Other times they are used to prevent issues from developing later on. \n\nYes braces can also be used purely for aesthetics but that doesn't mean it is their only use.", "I didn\u2019t call her spoiled for having braces. I called her spoiled in general I haven\u2019t received any presents for my birthday or Christmas because ik that\u2019s something my parents can not afford rn and I don\u2019t want to push them more into debt for something I really wanted knowing we can\u2019t afford things", "Lol the initial up front down payment is typically 2k+ just to put that shit on", "OP said the braces were medically necessary", "OP said they were medically necessary so no.", "Give your head a wobble.

What a crappy thing to to do.", "As someone who had parents that refused to get me braces I have permanent joint damage in my jaw. Even small problems with a bite can lead to big problems if they\u2019re ignored.", "It is a medical appliance. Like a cast for your teeth. It is moving bone.  As the teeth move, the bone reforms. Dental care is a medical proceedure of the mouth. Many countries cover some dental care the same as medical. Except for elective treatment, the same way as it wouldnt cover elective medical treatment.", "None of this is ok and I feel like you're just used to it so you think it's an acceptable way to parent. It's not. At all. Why did you get nothing while your sister got a TV? I can see why you got mad at your sister as she's clearly the favorite. But that's on your parents, not your sister.", "OK the TV vs nothing is something to complain about because this wasn't a NEED and is a luxury item. Braces are not a luxury problem. \n\nI am sorry if your parents are treating you unfairly. This is something that is not obvious in your post. I wish you the best.", "You\u2019re also an adult and she\u2019s a child.", "My childhood dentist told my parents I needed braces, and their response was to find another dentist who would tell them what they wanted to hear. So I continued on into adulthood with an overbite around 12mm and other issues. Parents can choose not to follow medical advice.", "Most orthodontists won't put braces on 10 year olds because their adult teeth aren't grown in yet. I started having orthodontic work done in 4th grade and it fucked my teeth up even more in the long run because I hadn't even lost all my baby teeth yet.", "You have no idea if the braces are medically necessary in this case though. Giving it as a birthday present if she actually needs them isn't such a great gift and I could completely understand the sister being upset. \n\nAlso even if the sister was wrong, op is also wrong for following her little sister around berating her while she was crying, causing her to get more upset, to the point she was running to lock herself in the bathroom to get away from op. And then going into her bedroom after that when she clearly wanted op to leave her alone. Like give her some space. That is not the right way to handle it. Op is just adding more stress on her parents shoulders by acting like this", "Over $10k for my son who had them off by age 10yo.

I\u2019ve been there. \n\nYTA anyway.  \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing regardless\u201d. Ok then why tf are you on Reddit bitching about it when you already know you\u2019re gonna act a certain way no matter what?", "YTA. My son will need braces in a few years but to tell him I won't buy him anything 'fun' for him because he needs braces will be cruel. It sucks being in financial difficulties but it's up to your parents to manage the finances. Your sister is 14yo and you cannot expect her to behave like an adult. This is when she needs to learn how to prioritize needs and wants. Getting angry and guilting her for behaving like a teenager is only going to cause more problems in the future.", "Wait so they gave her a thousand but she needs 5k. So essentially her gift was they were telling her they had part of the money? Or was it the last 1k? Maybe I missed something.\n\nThe TA move was hounding her and following her from room to room to continue to berate her. Say your piece then be done.", "Braces are not always necessary, but in some cases they are. Just like many other healthcare procedures. Dental care is healthcare.", "Your anger is misguided, it\u2019s your parent\u2019s choices you\u2019re angry about. \n\nYou understand the adult side of things, but a teen won\u2019t have the maturity to see it as the gift it is. \n\nI don\u2019t fault you. But it\u2019s shitty from your parents to frame it as a gift, while it should just be care. UNLESS your sister actively asked for braces.", "So why wasn't she referred at the proper age years ago? She's already late to the game", "So you did get a present at 14, just like her.", "So the parents would be TAs then? Because that'd be harsh as a kid", "OP is still their child though...and I have a feeling it's not a new thing so it's probably been happening since before they were an adult, I wouldn't be surprised. And while she's technically a child still I think she should be aware of the world enough to have sympathy for her parents and realize how her sibling is being treated compared to her, but she isn't because she's been raised to be spoiled.", "I'd be so interested to hear about how that went for you, but this probably isnt the right place to further it (?) if that makes sense. I am sorry that happened to you though :(\n\nI see dentists refer to ortho roughly at that age, but the real timing is when the second molars come in. Text book wise, that's usually a couple years down the line, but I did realize through your comment I may be living in an area that has kids that develop in that sense, faster. That didn't occur to me, so that's my bad. Sorry!", "My great-nieces each had pre-braces at age 8 for 18 months.  The 14-year-old is now getting her second round of braces, each at 5k.  The 11-year-old isn't far behind.", "I didn't think of it in this light, I guess it took another person laying it out similarly to realize", "We do know that they're not medically necessary because if they were the sister would leap at the chance to get them.", "It\u2019s not cheap!", "Lol, try all the other medical shit thats actually needed and an emergency at that. Surgeries to save ones life of any kind, C-sections, birth and labor, and infected cavities and pretty much everything that you need done is gonna be your debt for the rest of your life.", "Honestly, I have no idea where my parents even did that in the first place, but when she was crying and stuff that\u2019s when my dad just said here take $200 from this grand and do whatever you want with it but the rest it does have to go towards your braces", "Literally, I sympathize with them cause I can only imagine how hard it must be to leave with such a tight financial situation. My family isn't doing great in that way either but I've always been extremely grateful for everything that I've been given so I feel like even if it's not the best \"gift\" she still could've shown gratitude since they put that large amount of money aside just for her? I know it could be considered a not big amount to some but in a bad financial situation it's a big amount. Especially since she wants them along with needing them. 14 is an age where you're mature enough to know about financial issues and stuff I'd say?

It strikes me that she's 14 and asking for them - there's something missing there. They would've known she needed braces long ago, but why was that not handled then? Money reasons? Necessity reasons? There's just a missing detail that makes it not make sense.", "She did ask for braces she was complaining about a month ago to my dad about her teeth and how badly she wanted them. Regardless they were going to pay for them since they had been saving up for a year but when she said that to him he thought it would be a nice gift.", "Is this OP\u2019s alternate account or are you just as much of an AH as OP since you\u2019re replying something snarky on every single comment on this post?", "At 14? No she's not.", "No she isn't. For many they wait for the permanent teeth to come in. This starts around the age 12.  Many are 14 - 16 befor starting orthodontic treatment.  Especially if they are waiting to see how the jaw is developing naturally. We would often send children for referals to a specialist early to see if there were preventative care that could prevent the need for braces, but the actual braces came much later.", "Yes a new pair of shoes I needed", "Probably more ESH because brother then chased her around the house to tell her how spoiled she is for being upset.", "I read ops comments after I wrote that.
