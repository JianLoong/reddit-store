When I gave her the money she thought parents were letting her buy whatever she wanted but when my dad told her it was for her braces she burst into tears. She started to tell my parents that\u2019s not what she wanted for Christmas and that she wanted something else. So my dad decided to give her $200 out of the original grand to let her buy whatever she wanted and the rest would go towards her braces. My dad didn\u2019t understand why she was upset since she was the same one who was complaining to my dad a month ago about wanting to get braces. \n\nAfter we were done talking I went upstairs with her and called her an asshole. I told her it wasn\u2019t fair to our parents who had been working their butts off to save the money in the first place especially in this economy. I explained to her that even if she didn\u2019t like what the money was going towards she should\u2019ve just been grateful for it and left it at that to not make my parents feel bad. When I said all this to her she started to cry even more and ran into the bathroom. When I try taking to her she ignores me and when I go to her room she tells me to get out. Honestly I am not apologizing to her regardless because after everything happened my mom came to me saying she felt upset at my sister because she doesn\u2019t know how hard it was to save when we\u2019re just getting by.

I grew up poor, so yes, getting braces for Christmas would've been a gift we got. Mom would've been working all year to save up for it. We always said thank you and we're grateful for it, but also disappointed too. It's a normal human reaction. \n\nYour parents suck, because it is a crappy gift. Don't think they should've given her the money. Just tell her \"hey we finally have the cash to get you braces\". Trust me, I get they worked hard for it and thought she would be excited, but unfortunately it didn't go as planned.\n\nYour sister sucks, because her reaction was a bit over the top at 14. She's not a little kid where she doesn't understand it. Yes, we can say she should've behaved differently and be grateful, but I truly understand her disappointment. It was a sucky gift whether she is spoiled or not (unfortunately that is a subjective opinion). \n\nAnd you suck, because you just should've stayed out of it. I totally get your point you were trying to make to her and thought you were being a defender of your parents, but it wasn't needed as they are able to defend themselves. You should've waited until she wasn't upset or if she asked you for your opinion on that matter. Then you could've said \"yeah it was a sucky gift , but mom and dad worked hard to save up the cash for you and were excited to give it to you.\" She could've context clued it together on her own.", "INFO: Does she actually need braces?\n\nEdit; YTA I\u2019ve read the comment that says she does need them so really yeah you\u2019re parents shouldn\u2019t of made it a Christmas gift or a gift at all. It\u2019s medical and no matter the price, it\u2019s something you have to do when you decide it have kids. It all comes with it.", "OP you need to edit your post because you comment that your sister NEEDS the braces, not that she wants them and that yalls parents knew for a while but couldn\u2019t afford them. \n\nSo yes YTA. Medical care when it is NEEDED is not a Christmas gift, or a birthday gift or a surprise. \n\nEveryone say N T A should see that comment before making judgement. 14 yr doesn\u2019t want them because she\u2019s in America and it\u2019s a \u201crequirement\u201d to have perfect teeth which by the way not everyone thinks that and there are cheaper ways to do it than braces.", "YTA Your sister is 14 years old. 14 year old don't think about the big picture. Personally, I think it was rather shitty for your father give your sister money for Christmas only to tell her, it's not for her, it's for her braces. I didn't make my children pay for the dental or orthodontic care or try to pass off my responsibilities as a parent as a gift.", "For this family it seems that braces are a priority snd only so much money to go around.  The 19 yo is understanding what her parents have gone thru to save this money. 14 yo is not realizing what they did for the money. She wants presents , where 19 yo has gone without. It\u2019s not our place to determine what they can or can\u2019t afford. Is it an ideal Christmas gift?  I guess for some it would be.  Not every family has extra money just because it\u2019s christmas. They saved for her braces.  19 yo could do better trying to explain to her sister. But you can\u2019t force gratitude.  14 yo needs to understand her families limits and appreciate what they can do.  Maybe in the future the family can set up a Christmas account. And family can quit spoiling her if money is so tight. Nothing worse than an entitled child growing into an entitled adult", "Yta wait\u2026.your parents gave her a medical procedure as a gift? Wtf plus she\u2019s a minor why would they give her money to pay for braces? Shes under their care, that is fully on them", "YTA. She's 14yo and I'm guessing she asked for braces because she needs them because something is wrong with her teeth that needs to be corrected. \n\nRegardless of how expensive it is, it shoudn't have been framed as a Christmas present. And I question how 'spoiled' she actually is if dental care is considered a luxury within your family.", "YTA\n\nMedical care **is** a shitty Christmas gift for a child.\n\nYour sister should get braces because *she needs them*. She should get a Christmas present because your family celebrates the holiday.\n\n~~And FFS, what fly-by-night operation will give you braces for just $1000, anyway? It should be *several times* that.~~ OK, they cost more \u2014 this still *sucks* as a Christmas gift.", "YTA.\n\nYou might even be right, but it is **not your job** to parent your little sister. \n\nI have an observation. Older siblings almost always think their younger siblings are spoiled brats. Often it's because kids at younger ages **are** spoiled brats. And the older kid probably was too at that age. But in addition, parents often become **more relaxed** in their parenting style, so they may really be less harsh and more flexible with younger kids. This annoys the older kids, since they feel it's unfair, even if the updated style is better parenting. (Source: I am an oldest child and I had these feelings. Now that I'm older, and a parent, I see things differently.)", "She's 14 years old.  She's a child who is not old enough to completely get it, and your parents handled it poorly because while somebody might want braces, but most of us don't want them for our Christmas present. Cut her some slack.", "I agree with everyone else. 14 years old i would have been pretty disappointed with that. I got braces, and i know my parents worked hard for that, but i still got christmas.", "OP, i got a question\u2026 does your sister NEED braces or does she only WANT them?", "NAH.\n\nYou and your parents are understandably upset because it is a lot of money for you and you expected her to be grateful. She is understandably upset that she only got braces for Christmas, which don't really seem like a gift. You shouldn't give medical necessities to kids as gifts. You should all just chill, tempers will cool down and it will be fine.", "YTA and so are your parents. Medical care is something that decent parents provide for their kids. It\u2019s not a gift or an extra.", "I'm so sorry everyone is downvoting you. I understand what you are going through. Some kids just don't understand how hard it is nowadays to save and afford anything. They think money just grows in trees. Good luck. I hope eventually she will understand.", "NTA. \n\nBraces are medically necessary for many but insurance rarely covers it.\n\nIs it a FUN Christmas gift? No. And it is not one she will appreciate for many many years but it is one that she WILL appreciate later in life.\n\nWith the cost of living right now, sometimes the fun stuff goes by the wayside to make room for the necessities. The fact of the matter is, sometimes a need has to outweigh a want and this is likely the first time your sister has been smacked upside the head by the reality of her situation.", "She should be glad she is even getting braces so many familys cant afford that even with saving my family included. I need braces but we cant afford for me to get any and still pay the bills she should be grateful she has this opportunity", "Most often than not braces are cosmetic procedures. So if she didn\u2019t need them and just said she wanted it to she looks better, yes, it\u2019s a valid Christmas/birthday present. \n\nAnd a 14 year old is old enough to not throw a tantrum.", "NTA\n\nYou did what you should do as a big sister -- at the right time: support her, validate her, but also correct her and offer an \"objective\" view of what's right/wrong. It was CRAZY thinking for her to believe she was getting a free $1000, and while it was weird of your parents to give it to her, rather than just saving up and taking her to an orthodontist (I know of no child who got paid the money for their own braces - parents take you to a doctor!)\n\n14 yo's are not rational people. Sometimes they masquerade like it, but they are often petulant children who are more than happy to take and whine when they don't get more. They think it's endearing or cute or funn, and sometimes when called on it, over-react out of disappointment or shame. She's overreacting for attention - don't feed it.", "Braces are not a gift. That's just something a parent should do.", "NTA. Whoever is calling her an asshole clearly didn't grow up in a low income household with a spoiled sibling. I did and I remember my parents doing the absolute most for us and being heartbroken when my sister behaved a certain way.  14 is old enough to grasp a certain amount of the complexities of your situation, at the very least know about your parents financial struggles.  I got orthodontic treatment for my 16th birthday because I asked for it and really wanted it.  You can live without braces, they're almost always cosmetic but you can't live with a false, spoiled perception of the world you were born into.", "NTA.", "idk why ppl are saying braces are a medical need, they most definitely are not and they are extremely expensive. iv had them myself and if my parents payed for them for Christmas i\u2019d be happy  bc that\u2019s a lot of money and something they are doing for me\u2026. it\u2019s not really a need as much of a want so i\u2019m leaning towards NTA", "The fact that you call your sister spoiled for having braces is really telling. You see these braces as care while your sister, as a 14 year old, sees it as punishment. \n\nIt\u2019s not that big, but to your sister it\u2019s big. \n\nSomething that should be considered as physical care she must see as a present. \n\nAs an adult, I see it, as a 14 year old I would feel like I\u2019m being punished for having bad teeth genetically. \n\nAnd while my sibling receive something that makes them an instant gratification, my gift is pain in the present hoping for the future. It\u2019s not really a happy time for her either.", "Apparently yall health insurance is better than most. Please donate for the braces!!", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s unfortunate that as parents we aren\u2019t as open with our children as we should/want to be. She obviously doesn\u2019t understand that you all don\u2019t actually have the means to get  her braces right now but they are trying\u2026 however the delivery was all  wrong, they probably should\u2019ve led with \u201cwe know how much you want/need braces, we\u2019ve saved  the initial deposit\u201d now they are down 200$ to a whiny ass teen who probably just needs a spanking anyway.", "Children are used to getting their NEEDS covered by their parents. She sees braces as a need, and likely this is true.  \n\nGifts are not usually the NEEDS but WANTS.  \n\nI understand how your sister would feel cheated. The idea of going to school and saying that her gift was braces.  How would you like it if you broke your leg and your gift was crutches?\n\nSoftly YTA because all you see is the money that was spent on her. \n\n(Some family's budget is so tight that gifts may be practical and in the NEEDS catagory.

We all know how difficult teenage emotions can be.", "I wouldn\u2019t call getting braces a gift. That said, I also think throwing a fit over this, given how hard everyone is working to make it happen, is pretty ungrateful.

They should have given her some kind of symbolic gift that represented the braces and then added to it with some nice, affordable things that she could enjoy in the moment.

You chose to have kids, you provide for them, and they shouldn't have to clap like seals for it. \n\nYou seem like you are jealous of your sister and the gifts she gets which is valid, but don't pit yourself against your sister. If your parents didn't or aren't treating you equally, that is on them not on her. And you can't expect a 14 year old to be devlopmentally on par with you at 19. 5 years of life experience and brain development is a big deal and you might have been just as \"selfish\" when you were younger. Your parents discussing their feelings about her to you is not ok beyond asking your opinion on her reaction maybe.

They are giving her $1000 towards the cost of the braces which are 5k in total. Which I'm not criticising at all,but the burden from what I can see is now on a 14 year old to find the rest?", "Glad someone in this thread is making sense. I have never had my parents spend $1000 on me... ever. The money just wasn't there and I understood that. If they had somehow saved $1000 and surprised me with braces for Christmas I would be over the moon. OP's sister deserves some leeway because of her age but is definitely acting like a spoiled brat and shouldn't be made to think this kind of behavior is okay.", "I literally haven\u2019t received any birthday gifts since I was 15\u2026", "Because that\u2019s what she wanted, she didn\u2019t want Invisalign she just wanted braces", "Still a shitty gift bro especially for a kid", "So? That doesn\u2019t make your sister wrong. That means that your parents are neglecting you. Sucks for you but that is something for you to take up with your parents - not take out on your sister.", "You parents have successfully conditioned you that their behavior is ok and you took it out on your teenage sister. They could have bought or made you a little gift. A cute pair of socks for all I care. You should take your frustration out on them.", "Then get mad at your parents, not your sister.", "OP is the sister, not the parents. The parents should have talked and explained whats going on.

Yeah, no.", "no, it would be better to get absolutely nothing than to be handed 1k then be told \"syke, it's actually for your medical procedure\"", "as far as i understand the parents are paying the full $5k, they just only had $1k to give rn. so she's not expected to pay for the other $4k", "She called it out with shitty behaviour herself, literally chasing a crying girl around the house shouting at her, making it ESH", "It absolutely is", "Except that the way they did it is shitty. The right way to handle this kind of situation with a kid that age is to sit them down and explain that Christmas is going to be pretty small this year, because Mom and Dad are working really hard to save enough money to get her the braces she needs, and there's just not going to be much left over. Then you wait for the holiday sales and get her a squishmallow, or a video game, or something else in the $20-30 range to unwrap on Christmas so it feels festive and loving. \n\nShe is old enough to understand if it's explained properly, and would probably react with gratitude and understanding if it was presented that way. She may have even told them that the braces are enough and not to worry about Christmas gifts, I know that's how I would have reacted at her age. Being upset that they pretty much said, \"No Christmas for you because your braces are expensive,\" and then dismissively threw cash at her a MONTH before actual Christmas when she was sad about it does not make her a monster.", "You still don't gift medical care for christmas. And you especially don't gift a sum of money with a purpouse attatched. They could have gotten her something small for christmas, it didn't even have to be for the 200, but they should have gotten her an actual gift and just got her the braces simply because she *needs* them.", "I think it's honestly better to say \"no gifts this year\" than try and present medical care as being a gift.\n\nThe first option is a shame. The second is insulting", "She doesn't need them", "OP stated they are needed", "THIS all day long.", "Why is everyone assuming that the 14yo has to pony up the remaining $4K? The most logical outcome is that the parents will be paying the $5K over the course of the treatment (payments are usually on a payment plan with orthos) and they had the $1K upfront to surprise with", ">so it\u2019s about $5,000\n\nSo the \"Christmas gift\" isn't even braces? Because that's only one fifth of the money.", ":( Sorry to hear that. I am 30 and still get a present from my mother for my birthday.", "And I want to add: That your parents saved 5k for her braces is awesome. And something to be grateful for. But independent from having no money for gifts, it would be better to explain this to the kids and try to find some alternative for christmas. E.g. we are 3 kids and always were allowed to chose something worth $50. If it was more expensive, we could combine it with birthday money or our savings. \n\nWith this, we learned to save our pocket money, so we could afford something like smartphones or laptops.", "If you read the comments you would know that in this case they are necessary", "That is not the point.

You shouldn\u2019t go into debt for medical care!", "Ah okay that's better info.\n\nLook I get it, you think that she's behaving bratty because it's something your parents have killed themselves to provide, and represents something you'd kill for to receive.\n\nBut try and see it from your sister's perspective. She's still just a kid. I know she may not look like one to you, but she is. Kids get excited about Christmas gifts and have high expectations. And yes, traditionally Xmas gifts are 'wants' rather than 'needs' so it makes sense that she's so bitterly disappointed. I understand that your parents are doing the best by her in the circumstances but they probably should have prefaced that *before* giving her the gifts. Without that she was set up for failure with her (normal) high expectations.\n\nYou coming after her was also nasty and unnecessary. She knows that she behaved ungratefully and already feels bad enough herself I promise. She's not just upset at your parents but upset at the unfairness of life that her parents can't give her the normal stuff off her wishlist like other parents and most kids her age get.\n\nGive her a break honey. Big feelings can come out wrong at the best of times, and this is a kid dealing with the realities of financially struggling parents at Christmas time.", "Were you given new shoes directly, or did they wave the cash under your nose and then tell you the cash was for shoes?", "oh love the idea of a sarcasm font lol", "Literally, like, yes dental care should be free. So should emergency necessities. So should all medical care.

And then she was told \"But it's not for you to spend, it's for medical treatment.\"\n\nThe best I can liken it to would be if you're gifted a new car and then told \"but you can't drive it, your parents will need to drive you\". In both cases the reciever does not get the freedom that comes with the gift. \n\nIn all honesty, I think she would've been more okay recieving nothing for Christmas if it was explained that they couldn't afford it because they're saving for her braces. The big problem with this was how it was handled. I hope that makes sense. My judgment is a solid YTA for not even attempting to see it from her perspective, and your parents for doing it the way they did.", "This is reddit. It's full of completely delusional people\n I did just read some replies people were sending you, and it seems like they live on an effing delulu planet. You came to a wrong place for an advice. At 14 i could only dream about braces, and it would be the best gift (considering i stopped getting any for a New Year (we celebrate it like you celebrate Christmas) when i got into my teen years)."]}
