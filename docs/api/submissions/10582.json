IMHO $400 is nowhere near enough to run a household esp if you are covering children and their expenses.\n\nMy wife gets botox for migraines and TMJ as well and that stuff has become important now that I see how bad the headaches get and how much the botox helps.\n\nWTF is the deal with this \"he cut me out of our accounts\" bullshit though.", "The only way you would be the AH here is if you DON'T get yourself some counseling for putting up with this financially and emotionally abusive behavior from your so-called husband!  He gives you a lousy $400 a month to manage a household?  Essentially he is saying that the time and work you put in as a SAHM is worth exactly $0!!!!  This situation is covered in red flags and you need to seriously consider walking away--no discussions, no negotiations, get yourself a job and walk away.  He does not value you or care about you--you are an unpaid nanny/housekeeper and he will continue to use and abuse you just as long as you permit it.

But she's still NTA.", "Yes I did have access to the account prior to us separating last year (we seperated march-dec)  \nbetween 2020 and 2022 I had full access (I became a SAHM and stopped working) I also became unwell and was on a lot of medication, had to attend private drs for immediate care (which cost a lot of money in AUS) we bought a brand new car and started my business (not an MLM) and I was pumping a lot into it in terms of advertising, manufacturing etc. So at the end of the 2 years, with all that and the cost of living we only had $10k in the bank saved.   \nSince coming back together and cutting me off he's been able to save the same amount in a year.... so he sees me not having access to our accounts and me paying for everything as financially beneficial.", "I do have a job, I run a business full time as well as being a SAHM, but I don\u2019t make money as anything I make goes back into the business.", "That\u2019s abuse.

It will not get better. That money will not go back into a shared account. He will continue to escalate as long as you continue to accept it.", "You need a good lawyer. You are a SAHM it is both your money not just his. He is financially abusing you. Look up child support & alimony with his income. He is lying that you would only receive $400. Even if it was $400 you wouldn\u2019t be spending it on groceries for him & your stepdaughter too.

And your child support would not need to cover his and his daughter\u2019s groceries and he would be up for half of your daughter\u2019s school needs. \n\nIn other words, way more than $400 a fortnight. \n\nGoogle \u201cFamily Advocacy and Support Services\u201d for your state.

The current money management relationship between you two is bad news. If you got divorced he'd be paying child support+ alimony or day care costs. Visit a family law attorney to clarify your rights as a SAHM in the event of an divorce.", "no. It is a business, I patented a product, manufactured it at a factory, I stock it and sell it. I don't think it's fair to immediately jump to the MLM conclusion, which I knew is what would happen as soon as I mentioned I'm a SAHM. When you output for a business, every profit you make needs to go back into the business for growth, and I still haven't made back what I outputted initially.", "I have no problem with you being a stay at home mom, but you're clearly unhappy with the current situation, the best way to fix that is to get a real job that pays. Put your business on hiatus for now, get that house bought with the cash and work from there. Change requires effort, not just bitching that your allowance is too small. Stop doing your hair at a salon and learn to do it yourself, not like salons will exist in 15 years anyways.", "I think I'm allowed to bitch that the allowance of $25pw after groceries from my husband to buy everything needed for my child and I is too small.   \n\n\nBut you see, it's not just for my child and I, it's also for my husband and family of 4.  \nthis includes:  \n\\- netflix, subscriptions etc  \n\\- the family spotify that my husband wanted   \n\\- setting aside $20 PW to do the ONE thing I do for myself. No nails, no pedis, just having an hour to myself without a screaming toddler on my hip.  \n\\- clothes, shoes, school necessities for my constantly growing daughter and step daughter  \n\\- additional groceries if we run out of something within the fortnight\n\nBS you don't have an issue with me being a SAHM, because on the next hand you say \"get a real job.\"  \nBeing a SAHM so my husband can work IS a job. Being a SAHM so we don't have to spend XYZ on childcare IS providing. Heaven forbid I want to do something for myself, right? Get a freaking clue.", "Lady, a real job is something where some pays you for your time and efforts. My wife is a SAHM, it's a job for sure, but it's not a real job and we both know it. \n\nQuit riding your high horse, cancel Netflix, cancel spotify, cancel whatever you gotta. We aren't living in the boomer golden ages where money can be saved whilly nilly while living in luxury. \n\nLearn to suffer like the rest of us so you can buy that home sooner. I want you guys to get that home, I'm jealous honestly."]}
