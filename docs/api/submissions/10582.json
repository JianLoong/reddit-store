He is ok with supporting her financially, give a stipend for her, fully paying all the bills, saving for a home, while she pours all her income back into her bsns.\n\nI think my idea and reddits of what constitutes financial abuse is pretty different.", "This, the food budget could go down with careful planning, and ditch the monthly haircut to every few months.  Clothing can be purchased 2nd hand for the 8yr old, this is not unlike any family on a tight budget has to do.", "Hold on a min, from that post it's hard to make that 'stretch'- fortnight, that's $800 a month, which is close to 20pct of his pay (not sure if the $2500 is his gross or net pay, and if that is monthly or fornight (which would make his salary $5k).   He pays all the other bills himself for the WHOLE family...if she were receiving CS, that would be HIS part of the financial contribution and SHE would be equally responsible to support their child as well.  $800 is a pretty generous allowance for JUST groceries and clothing for their daughter if all other bills are paid and that is his salary/only income, how on earth is that financial abuse?\n\nAlso, groceries are SKY HIGH everywhere, and we eat pretty good and it's 4 adults, and I can budget for less than that.   \n\nDoes he also pay CS for your stepdaughter or is he custodial parent?  Why did you quit your job?    I'm sorry but $85 a month for hair is a luxury many of us earning WAY more then you husband can't even afford, assuming you are young, probably not even as needed as older women when we try to cover our grey's.\n\nAre there any other treatments for tension headaches you can look into that insurance would cover you could try that would cost less?\n\nEven with a higher earning job, I can only afford to get my hair colored/cut 2 or 3 a year.  I do touch up roots at home in between, because that's what I can afford.  If he is trying to save for a house and there is unnecessary spending he can't reign in as sole breadwinner,  then he took a drastic measure, not the best idea.  That is something you need to make clear, you need full transparency of income, and screw the spotify, that is a luxury HE can do without as well. \n\nHow about budgeting to get your hair done every 3 months,   that's an extra $85 towards your other needs (and your daughters).  Furthermore, how about returning to work and contributing financially and having your OWN income to support yourself, your daughter and contribute to your household expenses equally while maintaining your financial independence?\n\nNo, I don't think it would be fair to cut him and his daughter off the groceries.  Remember that if you were a single parent, you wouldn't pay for their groceries, but you'd have every other bill you have paid for now, fully on your shoulders.\n\nI'll admit the 'hair' thing is a personal bias, because I feel it's part of a 'younger generation' entitlement, which starts when parents start taking their elementary aged girls to get highlights/nails before they can pay for it themselves or fully support themselves. It's more of a theory, but once I see in a LOT of younger girls, and yeah IMO things like manicures/highlights/expensive cuts are for grown women who support themselves financially fully.\n\nAs a, young adult, the first time I had highlights at a SALON and a manicure, I was 21, eyebrows waxes, I was living away from home and employed full time.  Sure, as teens we would do our nails ourselves, style our own brows and experiment with color/highlights us girlfriends would do at home, the thought of our parents paying for a spa/salon day other than a haircut was absurd and unheard of.  Highlights/color and manicures like that were for 'adult' women with jobs (or well off husbands lol).   To add, the OP is a grown woman, who for whatever reason is not working, so an allowance for her needs is appropriate for sure, but if your budget is that tight, you make sacrifices together, and YES, the monthly hair luxury would go before you would dream of stopping GROCERIES for your family.", "Ummm..are you sure there's not another woman or addiction he's spending all the money on?", "Random shit like groceries for a family of four? Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.", "You realize that there's only one month that's exactly 4 weeks long, right?  It's closer to $900.", "$200 a week is not much. If he is basing it on what she would get for their 1 kid that\u2019s fine, she only shops for herself and the 1 kid. Food for 4 of them is prob $150 a week.", "OP said $2500 PF - meaning, $2500 per fortnight. Or $5k per month. That allowance is not 1/3 of his take home pay.", "I\"m not saying it is much, but he is working w/the budget he has.   \n\nHer expenses as a single parent receiving CS would be vastly higher, and she would have to quit her bsns and get a job that pays a salary.\n\nI have also asked, does her step-daughter live with them full time, or does she live with her mom and he has visitation/pays CS?  That would make a difference as well.", "I corrected it after I read it, so he basically supports her 100pct so she can pursue her bsns that has had zero return on investment, and also gives her $800 a month to pay groceries and her play money (which is about 20pct of his salary), I don't think his request is unreasonable.\n\nMy suggestion would be drop the spotify and move the monthly luxury hair to every 3 months, tighten the budget on your groceries, and give herself some wiggle room until her bsns starts producing an income.", "Thank you I didn't know this! I'll look into talking to a financial advisor for my business because it honestly feels like I'm floundering. I'm putting a lot of energy into it and barely any reward back", "Which can mean one of a number of things (or a mix of things) such as - you're underpricing, your marketing is not reaching the right people, you've misjudged the market for your product, you're overpaying at manufacturing stage, you're not taking all the tax credits/write-offs you can and/or your not amortizing initial investments in the right way etc etc. Sometimes local councils or agencies have business advisers you can talk to for free.", "Are your kids not in school most of the day?  If so, what childcare expense would that be? Or is it your daughter that would need childcare only?", "oh my gosh you have no idea how invaluable the information you've given me is - I had no idea councils do this and it turns out my state government has recommendations and support! I never would have known/looked into this so thank you so much!!!", "Just pay for childcare then. Since it's not a \"real job\", it must be cheap."]}
