This is ridiculous. You are his father. Discipline is your department. Spoiling him is fine when it doesn\u2019t interfere with your discipline.", "NTA - she is not the parent YOU are. I suggest next time she undermines you, tell her to leave. No more bringing presents , tell her only on birthdays/Christmas/ Easter etc.", "NTA.", "NTA it\u2019s ok to be the fun aunt I am but kids need to behave and if he is in timeout then the ice cream goes in the freezer until timeout is over and the toys he refused to pick up are picked up. The ice cream would have been a good motivator.", "You are trying to raise a child.  Rules matter,  Listening to the parents matter.\n\nShe blew it.\n\nYou did not over react.  You reacted appropriately by taking her into a separate room to talk to her and she blew you off.  She disrespected you..\n\nI would tell her she can't hang out with you and nephew unless she is will to allow you to parent you son.  It is cool being the fun relative, but it takes back step to the actual parent setting rules / boundaries.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were disciplining ur kid to teach him not to leave his toys out. That\u2019s being a responsible parent. Ur sister spoils him a bit too much To the point he thinks he can get free things and not get in trouble. Set some boundaries with ur sister about when she comes over and if she doesn\u2019t  adhere to these rules, make it that she cant come over until she does adhere to the rules u set.", "NTA.  You are the parent, not her. She is undermining you.", "Excellent advice.", "correct, she has no kids", "Don't pull the 'don't have kids so they don't understand' crap. There are many parents who spoil their kids ; and many people who don't have kids that don't undermine the parents. Look at how many grandparents undermine their kid's parenting.", "Arguing doesn't necessarily involve yelling. I didn't see anything that indicated he yelled, so no apology needed.", "Both of them need a time out. Your son because he misbehaved and your sister who thinks that she can undermine and override your parenting decisions. Of course he's going to say that he's not going to do it again because he wants the treat.\n\nTell your sister that she is on a two week time out. After that she can visit without bringing him a treat. He should be happy to see her and not what she brings. If she can't abide by your rules, keep extending her time out until she understands who has authority over your son.", "NTA... you did everything perfectly including addressing it privately.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nAunts don't make the rules; parents do.", "Your sister needs to go on the naughty step. And the rule in 1 min per year sooooo.....   Sit her down for 25 min and explain to your son that she's there for back chatting and crossing boundries.\n\nNTA", "Thats insane. I thinks it okay to spoil kids sometimes but seriously? She couldn't wait five minutes? Nta", "NTA,\n\nAunts/uncles don't need to be there just for the fun stuff but also be strict when needed.\n\nOne of my uncles who has now passed, was as strict if not stricter than my dad when I did something wrong, but at the same time he was great the rest of the time. He played a big part in making me who I am today and his sons, especially the middle one are liem brothers to me", "I have a feeling I know exactly what your sister is like. You tell her something serious and she says: \u201cOooh, don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The problem with people like that is that they won\u2019t take notice until you bring them up hard and then \u201cyou\u2019re overreacting\u201d. My Mother was like that. You can\u2019t win. I would say that if she\u2019d listened the first time, we wouldn\u2019t be where we were when I was \u201coverreacting\u201d, but it didn\u2019t help. It\u2019s in their genes or something. Although I blame my Dad too, because he indulged her for more than half a century.", "NTA.  You need to set firm boundaries with her and let her know if she doesn\u2019t follow them she will no longer be welcome in your house.  If she wants to spoil your child as the auntie, that is fine, within reason and not in your home undermining your parenting.  She was fully in the wrong here.", "Yup! I recently had my niece for a week and before I even left my sister's house I asked what the boundaries were for auntie time, then followed them; it's common sense. I ended up being more strict than I had to (made her leave her tablet at home, earlier bedtime, etc.) and we still had a ton of fun.", "I agree. It seems to me op was very respectful. He took her aside so the argument wasn't in front of his son. I hope the sister sees this post. She owes him an apology.", "NTA that would be your sister undermining your ability to parent. I think moving forward she can have the equivalent of a date night at your place with your son but your house your rules.  If she can't follow them she needs to leave without making a scene.", "NTA. For the future, your child doesn't end the timeout. If they leave the timeout spot, start the timeout from zero (in other words, five more minutes). If your sister doesn't like it, put her in \"timeout\" \u2014 escort her to the door and see her out. She can come back after a suitable \"timeout\".", "NTA sister back up you don't step over parenting. You can be a fun aunt but not an AH. As a aunt I would of asked what happened and said well clean the toys otherwise no treats from me.", "NTA. She isn't the parent you are, don't let her overrule you like that. Also 5 minutes in the time out corner isn't a lot, up to you to change it or keep it, but I'd recommend 10", "Yup! You back the parent.", "NTA. You are the parent. She is undermining your authority with your child. If she can't respect it, she needs take a step back. Maybe she doesn't think you can be a good parent because you are the father? I hope not.", "IMHO being at your house means you really went above and beyond to do this. Most kids (unless they are really young and have a disability that prevents it) can understand that auntie or grandparents house may have different rules when they visit there. But aunt showing up at home and undermining a punishment already occurring is a big overstep"]}
