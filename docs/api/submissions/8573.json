We are taking a cruise wedding. Originally we were going to do a traditional wedding but after realizing the costs and that we didn\u2019t care that much about it, we decided to go the cheaper more fun route on a cruise. The wedding occurs on the boat before the cruise takes off. The ceremony is only 15 minutes and the reception only an hour. The cruise is three days so we get to party with our family and friends the entire weekend after the short wedding. We get to pick two drinks for an open bar and 6 food choices.\n\nMy mom and dad (technically step dad for sake of post but main father figure) were already planning on contributing to the cost of the wedding. Unexpectedly, my birth father paid 11k worth of backed child support which went to my mom, and now with that money she\u2019s deciding to pay for the whole wedding.\n\nWe have the diamond wedding option (the best option) and with that can pick from any of the food options in the gold (lowest), premium (middle) and diamond (highest) food options. So we could either choose a variety of foods between sections or choose all foods from the diamond section. 3/6 options we chose are seafood, which my dad is allergic too. 3 other food options are non-seafood.\n\nMy parents feel like my fianc\u00e9 and I are being inconsiderate for having half of the food options be seafood. My fianc\u00e9 and I feel like we\u2019re being reasonable figuring that 1) the seafood options are the best food options (ideally we want to choose more seafood options) and 2) the reception is only an hour and right after my dad can eat anything he wants on the all you can eat cruise.\n\nSo is my fianc\u00e9 and I TA for choosing half of our food options to be seafood at our wedding?\n\nEdit: \n\n1. He\u2019s allergic to shellfish (lobster, shrimp, etc.) not all seafood (like fish).\n\n2. He can cook it and be around it, just not it.\n\n3. The non-shellfish options are BBQ pork sliders (he likes), smoked salmon with cream cheese (he doesn\u2019t like) and bruschetta (he likes).", "created_utc": 1674948747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nsxi0/aita_for_only_having_3_nonseafood_options_at_the/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a little confused at the format of this meal. Will people be sitting down with a plate of food, or will there just be plates of appetizers to nosh on? As someone with an extreme aversion to all seafood (potentially allergic, but never bothered checking) I would be sort of pissed off if my spouse (I assume they share finances) was paying in full for a wedding and I could only eat two of the six food items being offered. It doesn't sound like there are six different choices of FULL MEALS he could choose from, it sounds like there will be an assortment of six small finger-food items available. That changes the situation considerably.", "NTA. 3 out of 6 are not seafood Did you consult dad about the non-seafood choices to make sure that there are things he likes? If not, do that, but Dad still has 3 choices of dinners.", "Did you include him in deciding the non-seafood options?

Also consider the possibility of contamonation/food handling that could put him or other seafood allergies at risk. 2 out of 6 is manageable. 3 is a bit meh, to be honest. \n\n(Please understand I'm also low maintenance though and wouldn't expect anyone to change on my preferences, just a perspective on menu catering. Also I throw ridiculous parties for 30+ people, regularly, and I never serve seafood, just because it is a bit of a polarising food option)", "A little bit of YTA.\n\nYou are aware of Dad's allergy, I would have gone 2 seafood, 4 non. Your parents are being very generous ponying up for your wedding, and what they're asking is not unreasonable.", "as a shellfish allergic person i may be biased, but i think a little YTA. why not just have your parents be included in the initial discussion about what food options to pick? then everyone can be happy", "I feel that OP was intentionally misleading in the original post. \n\nNormally when you talk about \"food options\" for a wedding, you are referring to a sit-down dinner where you offer the guest a list of the options and they choose one, and whatever that thing is will be a whole meal. OP set this up to make it sound like there were six different choices for a full dinner, and her dad is being a giant brat for \"only\" having two different options to choose from.\n\nIn reality, it sounds like there will not be a formal dinner, but instead six trays of finger-foods. Four of them will be seafood (not three, as she originally claimed), which he cannot eat. The parents are paying for the entire wedding, and OP really can't see past her own selfish shellfish desires in order to provide any substantial food for her own father?\n \nYTA OP.", "Slight YTA.. but torn between that and NAH. I think the biggest issue is that they\u2019re paying for the wedding but your father cannot eat three of the options and does not like the remaining three choices. And while appetizers can be fine, bruschetta is not super comparable to sliders in terms of it being like a meal. I would personally replace one of the shellfish options with something he picks. I get that y\u2019all love shellfish but unless everyoneeee you know loves it too, it probably won\u2019t be as popular as you think. It\u2019s a pretty common allergy and lots of people just don\u2019t like shellfish (or even seafood generically)\n\nAre you in Maryland or something?

You are only giving him 2 options, because you know he doesn't like the other non shellfish option. I just don't see why you wouldn't at least have 3 non seafood options, not just for him, but for everyone to enjoy the variety? I understand it's only an hour, he can eat what he wants afterwards, it's not super awful, but the whole \"since it's shellfish it's the best\" thought process is annoying.   I LOVE seafood of all kinds, but I would still have more variety.", "Soft YTA as sliders and bruschetta do not a meal make. It's not about the food.

Its not like he just doesn't like seafood but is allergic. Eh.", "YTA. I hate seafood. Four if six are seafood. Why would you do heavy on the seafood?  That\u2019s just weird.

Destination weddings are just a way for the couple to transfer wedding costs from them to guests.", "2/3 of the menu is seafood; salmon is seafood, just not shellfish; technically NTA but considering Mom is paying, maybe throw her the bone.", "Nta\n\nYou've been considerate in selecting things he can eat.\n\nFor the sake of keeping the family peace I'd consider changing the salmon one to something else he likes (or one of the shellfish options if the salmon is in your top 3) so he has at least half of the dishes he will enjoy.\n\nThe other option is to ask the caterer if they can do an \"allergy platter\" separately for him. Most will do this and it would then mean he has his own little platter of appetisers with a bigger variety of dishes.", "NTA...literally half the items are not seafood.  Many people enjoy seafood on cruises.   Is the issue that your dad doesn't like any of the other 3 options?  Maybe he could be consulted on those and can choose some of his favorites?

You shouldn\u2019t be expected to give up all seafood options simply because he has an allergy.", "NTA, you are offering both kinds of food.

I may be misunderstanding, but he still has three options to choose from on the menu, correct? I think it would be strange for them to demand everything you choose be something he can eat.", "NTA but you could be a little more b accommodating, just saying.", "YTA 4/6 dishes are things he can\u2019t eat when he paid. I also think some of your other guests won\u2019t be very happy because a lot of people don\u2019t like seafood. I wouldn\u2019t have more than 2 fish dishes.", "NTA  3 non seafood options are fine,", "INFO:\n\nIs your father's allergy triggered by the scent of seafood, or just consuming it?\n\nDoes the cruise kitchen have separate cookware for dishes served to people with seafood allergies to avoid cross contamination?", "INFO: are the six items the appetizers before the main meal? I am really confused if the 3C food items are supposed to be main dishes or side, dishes or appetizers? He said he can eat anything he wants after the reception \u2014 is there a separate dinner after that? If the three items to he can eat or appetizers, and the seafood items are more substantial, I would say that isn\u2019t fair.

If you want your wedding to be \"your way\" with no consideration for your guests, then you should pay for it yourself. How spoiled and self centred do you have to be to expect dad should be grateful for being able to eat two out of six dishes he is paying for. You know he doesn't like smoked salmon so it is an AH move to try and pretend that he has three things he can eat. Although entirely consistent with how self absorbed this post is. Why would you not have 1-2 max dishes your stepfather can't eat and the rest non-seafood?\n\nPersonally I would be telling OP that if that is the menu she has set her heart on, it is her wedding, her choice and her wallet. I won't pay for it.", "YTA. Come on, just have things your dad likes. One seafood option is reasonable but four things out of six that you know he either can\u2019t eat or dislikes? I would see that as rude even if he wasn\u2019t paying.", "NTA. Having half of the options is plenty for him and others who might not want seafood to chose from. 3/6 is better than having 1 or none. For example, Vegans/vegetarians (like my sister) didn\u2019t eat much. if anything, at my cousins wedding due to not having any viable options except the sad warm limp salad.", "NTA - Half of the option he can have. That's considerate for sure. If he can't be in the same room as seafood, that changes things.", "NTA - you can have whatever food you like at YOUR wedding. In saying that, if your Mum and Dad are paying for the whole thing, maybe give them a little more input on menu. But in my opinion, splitting seafood and non seafood in half like you have seems reasonable to me", "NTA. But you should have started with only 1 non-sea food option. Then moved to half. How gracious would you have been then?", "NTA, it's a cruise so a seafood theme makes sense, and if the options seem better then even more so.  Vegetarians / vegans or whatever commonly make do with 1 option if any at all.  3 options is more than enough and like you said he has the all you can eat cruise.\n\nIMO even if they're paying for it it's still your wedding and a few seafood options is a lot different than 0 seafood options, which would actually be inconsiderate.", "NTA. Food allergies are a real thing and you're accommodating people that have them. I don't understand why this is even a problem to your parents.", "Of note is that this wedding is being paid for by child support that your birth father (finally) paid your mom.  So really, this isn\u2019t a case of your stepdad paying for your wedding.", "Just letting you know if he\u2019s allergic to shellfish then almost 100% allergic to salmon.  I have shellfish allergy(anaphylaxis) and dr told me I would be allergic to salmon.  So really safely only has 2 options.  So kinda yta", "NTA-Your dad has plenty of non seafood options", "NTA half the menu is NOT seafood, that's not a problem unless someone wants to be an Ah about it, which apparently they are. This should not be an issue", "Nah - it is an hour before a cruise. Is there a compromise to maybe have 3 things he likes?", "NTA. 50% choice seems reasonable especially as you said it only concerns the reception, not the whole 3 day cruise.", "Nta\n\nIt's super generous of them to pay so much, but at the same time, he has 2 or 3 options he can freely choose from.\n\nAnd those seem like good options. Half half is a solid mix and you do have other guests tastes to cover for as well.\n\nHe's got access to all the options now, and if you only get one meal option then he can pick the one thing he likes and even that would be enough.\n\nThough even if he takes 2 or 3 options, let him have more of a say on those and get the 3 seafood things you want.", "NTA\n\nThere was some confusion generated about the fact that the options offered all sound like... *not substantial meals*.  And that felt initially like dad was being left to eat sliders and bruchetta as a meal.  But like OP states, these are just reception finger-foods, and what will follow is the cruise's full optioned, *all you can eat buffet*.  \n\nThe intention was not to leave dad with only tiny sliders and bruchetta to eat for an entire wedding - but to provide finger foods for everyone, before they all go eat main meals they can select for themselves from a large and diverse buffet.  They are highlighting seafood *on a cruise* (seems pretty normal), and offering two options for those who don't want/are allergic to seafood.  For such a short period of time as a reception, and after realizing that a full buffet follows, the dad being incensed feels a little... self-centered? self-involved? in retrospect.", "NTA.  When I went to a wedding we all ate the same thing (chicken- which I don\u2019t eat because I have had pet chickens).  \n\nAnyhow personally I think it\u2019s wasteful to have lavish weddings anyway but that\u2019s another thing altogether", "Definitely NTA. Most people in his situation would have to make do with only one option, if any. Three choices is more then considerate. It\u2019s a cruise; there\u2019s going to be seafood.", "NTA. Sounds delicious! A grown man can surely survive 1 hour with those as options. When do we leave? I love smoked salmon.", "NTA. Three options i think are enough for an hour reception. Is not like everything is seafood.", "NTA, 3 options is plenty", "NTA, this is a cruise, there will be food a plenty he can head to before or after.", "NTA - you are being very considerate to give him three options, especially because you would like more seafood options and you are limiting your preference for him. Some people just wanna bitch; sounds like he is one of them.\n\nETA: I wonder if this is really about the food, or if he salty that your mom took all the backed child support payments and spent it on you?", "NTA. They can eat the options that aren\u2019t seafood. Embarrassing that they are making a thing of this. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA but it\u2019s also not going to kill you to have a true mix of options your step dad could have out of respect, especially since it\u2019s appetizers and not meals. You\u2019ve got 4 seafood dishes, 3 of which he\u2019s allergic to, and swapping out one for something else he\u2019d like is a good gesture.", "NTA: I am sorry I don't understand the problem your dad can eat three of the foods at the wedding and this is only for one hour.

It may be a matter of what your other guests would prefer.

You probably don't want to say that their money can pay for the drinks and you'll pay the food portion either.\n\nI don't envy you.  There's something to be said for having a small intimate wedding and then inviting others along for a dinner at a restaurant and letting them know they are celebrating your nuptials.. and you formalised it at the registry office with just your two witnesses and you now want to throw a party!", "Nta literally half the options are not seafood.

Most catered dinners have 2 or 3 entree options. You have six. Your dad has a choice of 3. That should be more than enough enough.", "Then absolutely NTA!", "The person means that some people have extreme allergies to things that even the scent will cause a reaction. They were asking if OOPs fathers allergy was severe - which it isn\u2019t. \n\nAlso there\u2019s a difference between sea smell and sea*food* smell.", "Obviously he doesn\u2019t like the salmon\u2026it\u2019s seafood \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2026 you do realize that smoked salmon is still seafood, right?", "So you're doing heavy appetizers? That isn't the same as people selecting a single entree from a 6 option menu. And salmon is seafood. So 2 of 6 are fine? Maybe reconsider this breakdown.", "So 2 options for him. which others will eat as well. Salmon is seafood. So you're doing 4 seafood options. Yeah I think I'm leaning a little YTA on this. Take care of the very few guests you have coming for crying out loud.", "Smoked salmon is seafood...", "So my other comment was made before the edit. INFO needed: However, with the edit has your dad actually ate salmon before, as in do you know he won\u2019t have a reaction with 100% certainty?", "So You really only have 1 non seafood, 1 appetizer salmon is both seafood and fish.  I can see where they would be put out only having one option when they are paying for it.", "INFO - is salmon not a seafood?", "Then I'm not seeing how it's inconsiderate since he's got 2/6 things he likes and can eat. \n\nNTA", "Then I think the only worry is cross contamination, so check in with the cruise folks.", "Well from the title of your post, you can see how that's not what you said. You have 3 options he can't eat and one he won't eat. For a wedding he is paying for. Do better.", "But he doesn't like salmon.", "I would be irritated going to a wedding where 4 of the appetizers have seafood since I don't eat it.", "He didn't pay - the bio-dad backpaid child support to the mom. The MOM is paying for the whole wedding. Which is a 15 minute ceremony, followed by a one hour reception/party.\n \nThere will be 6 entrees, not full meals. Of the 6 entrees the (step)dad *can't* eat 3 and doesn't like one - so he has a choice of two nibbly things during that 1 hour celebration.\n \nAs soon as the reception is over he can head off to one of the restaurants on the ship and have a full sit-down meal entirely of his own choosing on the 'all you can eat' cruise they're going on for the next few days.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I would find 4 out of 6 entree choices being fish/seafood a bit seafood-heavy; being vegetarian the only thing I could eat myself would be the bruschetta. But the (step)dad is not going to shrivel and die simply because for a limited time he has two options he can eat rather than three.\n \nI just think it's a bit screwy to make such an issue of such a small/short-term thing, and add to the stress and tension, on the OP's special day.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Are you also not on team \u201cSomeone else is paying for me to do this thing so I should try my best to be as inclusive as possible to them\u201d.  \n\nOr is it only a one way street?  Accept the money and throw up a middle finger", "I didn't make a judgement. Just noted that OP is misrepresenting what she said. She said that there were 3 options, but in comments it turns out that there are only 2. If he has two options, just be honest about it in the beginning.", "Its not entrees per her comment, the three choices he has are pork sliders, *salmon* and cream cheese and bruschetta... so her definition of seafood is suspish.", "This is the way.", "I mean, not really. A cruise smells like seafood, IMO. And anyways, my point is that if he can handle being on open water for 3 days, he can handle being around some cooked seafood for an hour. He's just trying to make problems where it isn't necessary.", "They can be, but it isn\u2019t necessarily 100%. You can have allergies to both, or just fish (including)  or shellfish. I\u2019ve found it more common that people have it to both though, so I\u2019m also going to ask OP something about that.", "And people with shellfish allergies are also allergic to salmon", "It\u2019s possible that she\u2019s referring to a shellfish allergy and that he can still eat finned fish.

OP, please trade one of the others out for beef or chicken.  Your other guests may get tired of 4 seafood options too.\n\nEdit: typo", "The MOM is paying.", "You can be allergic to shellfish and not fish. Sounds like the case here.", "\u2026you think being on a boat over open seas is the same as smelling and inhaling aerosolized, cooking shellfish proteins? Yikes.", "This is not necessarily true. Salmon is not shellfish. It is finned fish. Separate allergy. It\u2019s like how people can be allergic to peanuts but not tree nuts etc. but regardless, may avoid the things they aren\u2019t allergic to due to cross contamination being so frequent.", "Most people I know who are allergic to shellfish choose not to eat fish and other seafood. Even if it is a shellfish allergy, OP is claiming half the dishes are not seafood when one of those is literally fish", "But its pretty symbolic to take the money from her parents and then limit her dad to 2 of 6 options on a table of food? I wouldn't be bothered but he or her mom obviously is.", "I think NAH but I\u2019d also be concerned about cross contamination in the kitchen with so many entrees. Has he ever experienced anaphylaxis? I would be concerned about him having to get medical attention but being on a boat.", "But he doesn\u2019t like seafood and so he has 1 choice out of 5 for a meal, but he is covering the costs for everyone.", "Wrong. The child support is not from the dad she is referencing.", "That's not how she described it though.", "How do you even know it's shellfish? You are projecting. Plus, OP has made it clear that the father doesn't have a problem with smell.", "My grandmother was anaphylactic to lobster but could (and would) still eat shrimp, crab, oysters, fish etc. Never even got hives from those but had anaphylaxis twice to lobster. I agree that most people choose to avoid all seafood, I know I likely would, but OP misspoke and meant shellfish and her father is apparently fine around finned fish.", "I could counter that by saying this is a wedding on a cruise ship. Without knowing with whom OP is booked for this, it very well could be they only serve primarily seafood on their ships and that this was the best OP could do. They haven't really stated either way on either position, so this is all inferring here. Hence why I didn't make comment on that portion.", "Yes you are correct. However my point still stands. Neither dad is paying for it\u2026", "Shellfish is more common than finned fish allergy. It\u2019s just facts. Regardless, both shellfish and finned fish can cause a reaction when cooking. Your statement is factually incorrect.", "This.  I can't eat lobster but I can eat all other seafood; fish, clams, shrimp, crab, oysters, you name - and I eat all of it.", "You don't think he made up for her biological father's lack of support? Come on now. He and her mother supported her and the back child support isn't some winfall they didn't sacrifice and do without.", "That's still not the point, but keep on your soapbox.", "Agree, guessing that step dad has spent more than $11,000 over the years.", "Right The comment I was responding to referenced who was paying for the wedding. \n\nwe\u2019re talking about money. The money came from bio dad and was owed to mom. It should have been paid years ago. \n\nThe comment said that dad was paying for the wedding\u2026stepdad is not paying for anything per the OP. Bio dad just paid his debt.", "And keep on believing that open seas smell like cooking seafood :-)", "You are being obtuse. The stepfather is her father figure, the person who partnered with her mother to raise her. That would be really abnormal if it didn't include financial support. That is why I said he is paying because the back child support reimbursed some of the cost of raising OP. Some of that cost was covered by the stepfather in every typical blended family. So its not the bio dad paying or OP's mom paying, its a choice the mom and stepfather made when they could have used it for the retirement savings they didn't get to accumulated while OP's bio dad was a deadbeat.", "My opinion isn't fact, you are correct :)"]}
