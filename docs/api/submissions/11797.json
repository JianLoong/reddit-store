His father and I are very supportive and we try to give him as much comfort as possible, but with L\u2019s 18th birthday party coming up it\u2019s beginning to become a bit of a challenge. L is friendly with all of my family except my parents because he\u2019s never met them. My parents are very strict and religious and they\u2019re, you guessed it, extremely homophobic. Homophobic to the point where I have personally witnessed them give death threats to a lesbian couple on the street before. They\u2019re never at birthday parties or family reunions/gatherings because of how disliked they are by most of the family. L wants to meet my parents because he \u201cwants to build a relationship with everyone in the family\u201d and when I told him no, he got upset. I told him they were homophobic and he said that he\u2019s accepted the fact that some people will just never accept him. When I said my answer is still no he went up to his room and hasn\u2019t really come out since.\n\nMy brothers and sisters texted me saying he has a right to at least meet them.

You mean well and I fully respect that. He's however an adult now. So if he wants to meet them, let him. HOWEVER set up a lunch. His birthday is not the place for what will be some absolute drama.

You warned him and explained why you don't want him to meet them. The best you can do is soften the blow when he meets them and prepare to offer him support after if things go bad, as you expect.

You warned him that they are homophobic. If he still wants to meet them, then give him that chance. Honestly, he sounds a bit naive. He has probably only been around people who are supportive of LGBT, which is great, but he doesn't know how bad it can be out there. Don't let him visit them alone. Once the comments start, have his back and get him out of there immediately.", "NTA. Maybe he feels some sort of resentment that you won\u2019t introduce him to your parents because you don\u2019t consider your stepson family. This could be the reason why he wants to meet them. Has he ever spoken to them over the phone? I feel like one homophobic comment would pretty much change his mind.  Please continue to protect your children, even if it\u2019s from your own parents.", "Soft YTA, he's 18 , even if your parents are homophobic, let him meet them. Let him make the decision if he will want to never see them, but denying it, makes you the villain even if your intentions are good.", "YTA. That's a soft YTA for me, because your unwillingness to have him meet your parents come from a good place. Here's the thing tho, you cant and shouldnt make that decision for him. You already told him they're homophobic and thats good than just saying no without telling him why. But since stepson still wants to meet them, you should let him. I'm sure they're not the first homophobic people he's meeting and maybe they'll turn out to be the worst, or maybe they wouldnt, but you gotta let him decide the connections he wants to build, and if that includes homophobic step grandparents then so be it. Just be around to help him when he asks for it.", "Your son is 18, let him make his own decisions.", "You will be the asshole. If he's about to be an adult, then you have to let him make adult decisions like trying to form a relationship w his gparents.

I don't see any positives coming out of letting known homophobes meet him. \n\nYou're acting in his best-interests.

He knows they\u2019re homophobic but still wants to meet them. Maybe he thinks he can change their opinion. Who knows, people sometimes change when something hits closer to home. Give him a chance.", "YTA. He is an adult. While I understand the maternal instinct to protect him, you're not going to be able to protect him from the whole world. You did your part by telling him what kind of people they are let him figure that out for himself. You cannot hold his hand his entire life and protect him from all the mean people in the world. You're going to have to let him grow up on his own and handle tough situations how he sees fit", "YTA - at 18, he has this right. Just don't do it at a party or other family gathering.", "YTA. I can emphasize with wanting to protect your boy but he's becoming an adult. He's been told the risk involved in meeting them and the decision on whether or not that happens should be his alone.", "Soft YTA\n\nHe's 18...if he wants to meet them he can find out for himself how they may or may not treat him. He's forewarned and forearmed. People will be there to help, and you can arrange an exit strategy. If your parents make asses of themselves...at least it wasn't an unexpected response? You're already acting like the worst has happened.", "YTA. He is an adult and he knows the facts. It might not be the best idea, but to prohibit him to shelter him is like treating him like a child and not respecting that he is nearly a grown up.\n\nYour intention is definitly good and it is important that you want to protect your step son from such people. But as said he is nearly grown up and allowed to make his own decisions. Second just because he is gay, that's not his whole personality and it might not even come up in the first meeting. Not because he has to hide it but propably because he doesn't want to tell strangers who he would love from the start. It would be a change to meet those people and to know who the are at a simple basis of acquaintance. And if anything goes wrong, his father will be there. And last but not least it could seem like you want to hide him because of his sexuality, so your parents won't think less of you and your family (don't think that that's the case, but it yould seem like that to a young man who just came out as gay)", "YTA if you explained to him, he is 18 so old enough to make an educated choice, and he insist he may be important to him. He is already incredibly mature to have understood nobody will accept him, and homophobia exists. If you, as you said, are still in contact with your parents and are part of your life\u2026 what you pal. To do. Hide him forever. Let the meeting happen and then let him decide for himself.", "NAH. I Can see that he would want a chance to meet them but some things are better left unknown. If they have a history of being mean to gay people this is setting everyone up for failure. \n\n\nIt would be if a dog has a habit of biting cats. You aren\u2019t going to bring a cat around just to test it out when you know what would happen. Even if this cat has been around dogs and is a tough cat. It sets the dog up to bite and the cat up to be bitten.", "NTA. The family doesn't want them around and they issued death threats to queer couple. \n\nMake it clear that you don't want them further into your life because of the way the treat people and the rest of your family feels the same way.\n\nIf your step-son really wants to meet them, then you can arrange another meeting, but that you do not want their behavior to ruin your step-son's birthday party for him or his guests. Just because he has support and feels he can handle homophobia doesn't mean everyone else has the same support or  ability to have hate directed at them or people they love just roll off their backs.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That you\u2019re protecting him from a potential hate crime?", "NAH. I see many people coming down on you for being low, very low contact with your homophobic parents. Sometimes for personal or various reasons a person cannot totally cut out toxic family members. If your stepson really wants to meet them then set something up but not at his birthday because this could quickly turn into a crap show. Sometimes unfortunately very young adults ignore warnings and are determined to find things out the hard way. Perhaps he thinks because he's your stepson things will be different. Wouldn't put 1 thin dime on that bet. Just be clear to him that they haven't changed their views in decades and not to get his hopes high.", "I would say NTA. I was in a similar situation, and it cuts both ways. My first instinct is to protect and knew the what the 'homophobic AH' (my sibling) reaction would be and informed said sibling of the situation, and they would *not* be allowed to speak anything against them or their choice of partner, and if they had a problem with it then they should not come to the family event.\n\nThey acted as I predicted by giving me an earful first then huffily informing me, they wouldn't come anyway and I seemed to prefer (I will not use their phrasing) over them they wouldn't feel welcome. I told them they wouldn't be if they intended to act like a jackass. They spoke a few more slur words (again I won't repeat). I said fine, then hung up. \n\nI had to explain the end result as to why they wouldn't meet and agreed they were better off avoiding that toxic relationship. It just wasn't worth it. \n\nI have found through my own experience, that there's a difference between a relative and a family member. I haven't spoken to said sibling in years.

You love your parents and you were not directly impacted. But when your son came out he is impacted. You have a choice to make, handle your parents, tell the truth to your stepson, and give him the choice as a soon-to-be adult but exclude yourself and make it known to all parties why or be involved only to the extent to support your son and still cut them out.\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor clarity, what it looks like to everyone in your life is you are unilaterally deciding your parents and stepson cant meet. You can talk to them. Which means they can't be that bad. Stepson would feel something is wrong with him, not your parents as you still communicate with them. That is the opposite of supportive and your stepson most likely is blaming himself and feels zero support from you here. He will do anything to feel support and verify if you feel shame over him. You are hurting your stepson.", "NTA but you need to have a frank discussion with L and explain all of your reasons, possibly with other family members who agree with you but listen to L about his thoughts. \n\nIf L really wants to meet them, just have a controlled location where he knows he can walk away from them if he wants and be there with him to support him.

He got get frustrated with you saying no and decide to go behind you and his fathers back to met your parents and come out to them thinking their love for him will overcome their homophobic nature. However with them shouting death threats in public to strangers munding their business there is a good chance theyll physically attack and abuse him if not kill him themselves and he wont have anyone to know where he is or be there to protect him.

From 2nd grade to age 18 I saw my dad all of 3 times. One of those times i was supposed to move permanently in with him but he instead dumped me at my grandparents house for the whole summer. If I really wanted I could try to reach out to my dad. But I'm trans and gay and he is both a homophobe and transphobe. He disowned my brother for marrying a Mexican woman, who has children who are half black. Oooooh man was he mad to find out he had PoC grandchildren, even if they arent biologically related. When it looked like I was going to live with my dad at 16 I was given rules for dating. 1 no black guys period end of story. 2 no Latino guys unless their family speaks fluent English and they can't be on welfare/food stamps or live in the poor side of town. Like I was given neighborhoods on a map that I couldn't date anyone living in there.
