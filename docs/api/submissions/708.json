So on Wednesday our class is going to an FCCLA meeting, where they talk about the different events we can compete in for the club, it\u2019s all day thing (8am-6pm). That\u2019s just the meeting, the club wants to go to Dave and Buster\u2019s after from 6-8/9. This is 32 minutes from where I live. By 6 pm I\u2019m ready for bed and eating dinner. I even said at the beginning of the year that I would just want to go home after the 10 hour meeting. I don\u2019t want to be out late on a school night. However my teacher has already paid for me to go and this one girl said I was being rude for not going.
