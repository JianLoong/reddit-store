Tell them when you feel cornered and talk about what is making you uncomfortable and figure out what\u2019s setting them off. Also tell them you don\u2019t appreciate all the yelling and the anger (that\u2019s just not healthy for any relationship ever and is incredibly in appropriate between parents and kids). \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel safe, seek outside help. If you think you could physically be in danger, go to a school counselor or someone who can help you contact the police and get you to safety. If you think the danger is mainly mental and they just won\u2019t be willing to talk or change, try to find ways to stay out of their way and gtfo as fast as you can. Often, if it\u2019s simply just a personality clash/non violent anger issue, it\u2019ll go away with not living together. If it\u2019s manipulative and a control method though, it\u2019ll follow you even after you move out and then you\u2019ll want to consider cutting them off from your life.\n\nPls stay safe and get help if you need it because what you\u2019re describing genuinely sounds dangerous.", "wtf is wrong with the adults in your life? NTA and i am sorry for you", "I wanted to add something - I really needed therapy after that.  I managed to get mostly out young (I went off to college at 16).  I ended up in an abusive mess because he\u2019d damaged my ability to stand up for myself and made it harder for me to resist emotional pressure.  I developed a Thing about disappointing people because of how often he said he was disappointed in me.  It helped me some that my mother recognized that his behavior towards me was wrong, and comforted me and tried to mitigate it, but the fact is, her mitigation efforts were pretty ineffectual and the damage was done.\n\nWhen we\u2019ve been abused, we become more likely to tolerate abuse, so try to keep a wary eye on the treatment you tolerate from friends and lovers.\n\nIf you can\u2019t now, you should seek therapy when you can.  I got therapy while I was still in the situation, and worked with a therapist at my school\u2019s counseling center in college.  It helped.  It took a while, but I did learn to balance my feelings about disappointing or angering people with setting and defending healthy boundaries.  I\u2019m actually now very resistant to inappropriate pressure and defend myself forcefully when needed. (Woe betide anyone who tries to do that to my loved ones, though.  My husband has said the one time even he finds me scary is when I feel someone is taking advantage of him and won\u2019t stop.)", "Are you the dad?", "NTA\n\nYour dad is a maniac", "Your father is abusive and emotionally immature.

Check out the book called \u2018Adult children of emotionally immature parents\u2019 which will help you gain some perspective and learn tools to deal with this while you still live with them. P.S. - please know that there are men out there who NEVER yell and when you start your own relationships one day you can set this boundary from the beginning. If a guy yells and loses control - BYE!  Don\u2019t let this pattern repeat in your future relationships. Good luck.", "NTA.  I want you to know and remember this always: it's NOT your fault.  Ever.

I was estranged from my father for a large portion of my life but he used to have behaviours like this. I could normally tell when he was in one of his moods and I worked around it. I can picture situations like the example you gave very clearly, I would have said \u2018oh, yes of course just let me find it then after a slight pause while I pretended to look for it ask how come you need it? If the first thing he heard was positive then he would tend to accept the follow up question as I was going through my school stuff to get it. It sucks to walk on eggshells like this but some small tactics can make life a little easier. I\u2019m not saying at all that this is what is going on in your home but my father was just a generally nasty man, he was very sexist (my brother could say what he wanted and would never get yelled at) and had very little time for me. Funnily enough he has appeared in my life again needing help and he now has dementia. No one else will bother with him so I have been helping get him settled in a care home and sorting out all his finances and things. Funnily enough when I talk he listens respectfully now because I have told him I could very easily walk away from him and cope with the guilt after the way he treated me in my life!\nYou won\u2019t be burdened with him forever but try some things to make life easier for you while you are stuck there and start planning ahead for your escape.", "I feel like there is more to this than meets the eye. Opie, is your dad yelling and blaming you for his outburst even when you don't argue a normal thing in your house? \n\nEveryone don't get me wrong I don't want to say that there's drama, but a parent getting angry and stomping off to the room to swear and cuss out after a child of theirs just ask a simple question is not normal, or at least to me. Also the mother blaming and yelling at op for something that is generally not her fault it's also a bit weird. Anyway Opie NTA."]}
