My son has two children, 5F and 2 mo son. My son\u2019s girlfriend moved in when she was 6 months pregnant and has been living with us since, due to her family and herself not seeing eye to eye. \n\nI live in a 2 bed so I have my own room, my son has his own and my daughter sleeps on her air mattress in the living room. We have been working on getting a larger place, but for now this was all we could do. From the timeline of my between now and 2 months prior, I have noticed a change in my daughter\u2019s behavior and my son has had several conversations with her regarding so. She will complain that the baby is making too much noise, if they grab something to eat from the kitchen, she will complain about the light, and even when they turn on the oven light instead, she will still complain and talk about the matter for days. She will say that it\u2019s bothering her due to it being \u201c2am\u201d, but both myself and my son will remind her that if anyone needs to eat at any time then they are more than welcome to do so.\n\nI told my daughter that her behavior is disrupting my household, I told her that she should move or find a different place to live especially since she has a job and works 5 days a week. She got upset and suggested that my son\u2019s gf move and began making low blows by saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t even her family\u201d or that \u201cwhatever her and her mother have going on has nothing to do with us and she should go home\u201d I told her that her behavior was unacceptable, I told her that she didn\u2019t have to pay her portion of the bill this or next month, but that she needs to leave.", "created_utc": 1669244235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z33a2g/aita_for_kicking_out_my_daughter_after_she_kept/", "score": 3914, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why does your son and his gf get to do whatever he wants to with zero consideration for the needs of other household members?\n\nIf your son needs to cook full meals at 2am, perhaps he and his kids should be sleeping in the living room where they have access to the kitchen and your daughter gets the bedroom.\n\nYour preferential treatment towards your son is very obvious.", "Info - \n \nTo clarify, your barely adult daughter is paying part of the bills and working full time 5 days a week. Due to your older son and his girlfriend and 2 children living in the only other available room, your daughter is maintaining a full time work schedule while attempting to sleep and get enough rest on an air mattress in the living room. With no space of her own. And people come and go in the kitchen at all hours of the night, which wakes her up. \n \nIt seems like a legitimate complaint if she\u2019s contributing to the bills. \n \nQuestion I have is can she not share your room? Just until you find a bigger place.", "To be fair, she is paying a portion of the rent and she still ended up on the floor in the living room.  Anyone would be cranky about that.  Does your son or his g/f contribute to household in same manner?  I think you left that bit out.\n\nMORE INFO\n\nSaw your answers and YTA  Your son has an issue using birth control that you don't seem to mind or even make him more responsible for.  Your daughter is still growing up and hasn't made the same choices, you would think a mother would have some pride in a daughter that works as hard as your 18 year old does and a bit of disgust for the son that can't keep it in his pants.", "YTA. Nobody gonna tell me that living with newborn is not disruptive. Your daughter work, pays bills, she needs stable environment, she doesn't even have a room and you tell her it's her problem and to move out? WOW. Poor girl. She's better off moving out and away from you.\n\nEdit: just read some more comments: YTA supreme! Choosing your irresponsible son over a daughter. He's already having 2 kids with 2 different women by 21 y.o. Yet you kick her out not telling him to get a place and grow up. If your daughter is willing to relocate, she's invited to live with me in Ireland.", "Your son is 21, and he has 2 kids, aged 5 and 2? Him and his girlfriend and 2 kids, live with you and your daughter in a 2 bed apartment? You don't see anything wrong with this situation?", "YTA. it's perfectly reasonable for your daughter to be bitter over the fact she's forced into a situation where her brother's problems have been forced into being her own.\n\nSorry but two kids and only 21? He had one at 16 and still didn't learn... Then had ANOTHER ONE without a place of his own?! But it's okay cuz mommy will bail him and his gf out... listen, I get that you wanna be a good mom but no doubt she is bitter of her perceiving him being enabled (whether or not that's the case). Then having to live with another person she probably didn't like to begin with. AND she has no privacy.\n\nAnd you chose him over her.", "YTA - If your son is old enough to make babies and play house, then he should get his own place. The fact that you're kicking your childless 18 year old daughter out who works 5 days a week and has been sleeping on an air mattress in the living room is ridiculous. If anything, your adult son and his baby mama and their two kids should be in the living room so that he's uncomfortable enough to man up and take care of his family. If your daughter is smart, she will get out and write all of you off. This is the most ludicrous enabling I've ever heard...to punish the child who isn't making poor life decisions for wanting to sleep at 2am!", "YTA. Another case of parents favoring one kid over other.", "Why can't she stay in your room even on an air mattress. She deserves a good night's sleep.

You\u2019re angry because it highlights the piss poor job of being a mother that you\u2019re doing.  \n\nThis poor girl has had the past 5 years of her life upended and controlled by her brothers dick being unable to wear a condom.

A lot. Your poor daughter.", "YTA. You\u2019re being ignorant if you really blame it all on your daughter and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you decide to kick her out that she never talks to you again.", "YTA. This has to be fake, it's so weirdly villainish. But if its true, maybe it'll long term be a blessing for your daughter to be kicked back, since you're clearly holding her back.", "YTA as is your son.  He is older than his sister and has two children with different women.  Why isn't it time for HIM to be responsible?  He and his girl should be getting their own place, not you kicking your daughter out because she's frustrated at being treated like Cinderella.\n\nA freakin' air mattress.  I ask you.", "you put her in an air mattress in the living room. Your son is reproducing all over the place. And she is disrupting the household? I call BS.\nYTA", "YTA - I have honestly got no idea how you wrote all that out without realising how wrong you are. You have an 18 year old daughter who is having to sleep in the living room on an air mattress (which is a tough decision but I think just about fair given the circumstances). Already she's probably feeling like she doesn't have a true home, because she doesn't have her own space and her sleeping place (which should be safe and secure) is temporary and not her own - add on to that that she keeps getting woken up at 2am (which is a horrible time to be woken up if you're sleep schedule is good btw, I've no idea why you put that in quotation marks) by people not respecting the smallest mote of privacy she has left, of course she's going to complain.\nAnd how do you respond to your daughter's very reasonable complaints? *You tell her to move out because she's disrupting the household* - how can you not see what's wrong with this??? She's sacrificed so much to make the household work and to give your son and his family a space of their own and you tell her she's disrupting it? **She saved it** by being willing to sleep in the living room, you can at least try and respect that a little bit by not having midnight snacks, or maybe even *planning ahead* and bringing any snacks you may want during the night into your respective rooms before she goes to bed", "YTA. If she has to sleep in the living room then it should be treated as her bedroom, so unles someone is coming into your bedroom and turning lights on and cooking in the middle of the night, I\u2019d suggest trying to stick up for your daughter a smidge.", "YTA - 18 is barely an adult and you're treating your own daughter like she's a third rate boarder in the house. She's sleeping on an air mattress in the living room and you're making her pay rent? You're failing her and it's no wonder she's sad by how little support she's receiving. You've given your son and his gf way more support and it's coming at the expense of your daughter. She's going to resent you so much.", "YTA. Don\u2019t make her pay bills when she doesn\u2019t even have a bedroom or a proper bed!!!! \n\nIf anyone is getting kicked out it is your son, his gf and kid. That\u2019s two adults who can work and support the child they chose to have.", "YTA and an absolute failure of a parent your daughter has to live in a shared space and because other people's actions are affecting her ability to get a full night's sleep you tell her she should leave how about if someone needs food in the middle of the night they have a snack draw or mini fridge in their bedroom a luxury that your daughter doesn't have", "yta \nyou\u2019re giving your son a crazy level of preferential treatment. if she\u2019s going to be on the floor in the living room, you should respect that while she\u2019s sleeping at the very least. Also, your son has had 3 more years to prepare to move out than your daughter. You don\u2019t care about him being a teen dad but can\u2019t handle your daughter\u2019s mere annoyance? there\u2019s a clear favorite here.", "YTA and when are you gonna teach your son about safe sex jfc what an absolute mess", "YTA.  Since your daughter has to sacrifice by sleeping on a mattress in the living room everyone else in the household should imo sacrifice by going to bed with a full stomach and not turning on lights or making noise at 200am.", "INFO: What bills does she pay, what's \"her portion,\" and what bills/portion do brother and gf pay?", "YTA without a doubt.  Your son is 21 and has fathered two kids, and has been given free reign to move in and disrupt everyone while not contributing anything to the home (except noise)?  If you can't feed them, don't breed them.  Easy to see why his baby mama and her family don't see eye to eye.  They should work and get their own place.  Your daughter should move out also to get away from your A-H-dom.", "YTA - is gf or son paying rent? If they need to eat MOTD and she doesn\u2019t, make them sleep in the living room.", "YTA. You sound like you hate your daughter", "What a failure of a parent, omfg. Pays a portion of the bill but doesn\u2019t even have her own room?? Please\u2026.", "\ud83d\udcaf YTA. You are giving your son every bit of space you havez which he only needs because of his own irresponsible decisions, while demanding your daughter be ok with not even being able to sleep due to people walking around. You make it sound like your daughter is some sort of bad guy here for wanting to be able to *sleep* at night. If she can move, she might be better off. Sounds like you're gonna be supporting your son and his growing family forever.", "YTA for sure... the more I read the post I felt worse for your daughter. You've already given her the couch and still charge her but yet give your son and his gf a room for procreating when they weren't financially responsible...\n\nThat's like reinforcing bad behavior because you think they deserve the bigger space because they have a bigger family? Your daughter sleeps on a couch in the living room where there's a crying baby and probably has to share a bathroom and living space with 2 other adults who think they deserve everything in the house.   \nPlease reconsider how you're treating her. Rather than antagonize her you should be helping her by helping your son learn what responsibility is.", "So your 18 year old daughter who pays to live in a shared space where she constantly gets woken up is getting kicked out because her brother who is 3 years older keeps having kids he can't seem to afford and you are questioning if you are the asshole for kicking her out hahahah yaaaa YTA", "YTA. Your kitchen doesn\u2019t have to be open round the clock. No one will drop dead in the middle of the night from lack of food. It\u2019s called consideration since your daughter has to sleep in a common space. I would be livid.", "YTA. If you're going to have your daughter sleep in a common area, the least you could do is try to respect her privacy while she's sleeping. Saying anyone can get food at 2 am is pretty damn rude to her. How would you feel if your daughter just started coming into your room in the middle of the night and turning on lights waking you up.", "YTA. Your poor daughter. Is the 5 year old with your son's current girlfriend? Have you talked to him about birth control? Is there a plan for the 21 year old to live independently?", "Ya kick out the responsible one in the living room with no privacy for the one who can\u2019t keep himself from knocking up someone when he was 16 and has one or  two other kids? Your 21 year old should take the living room so your daughter can have the room rather than kicking her out when your irresponsible son is waking her up. YTA 100%\n\nAlso if you don\u2019t want to give her the bedroom she rightfully deserves, why don\u2019t you buy him a mini fridge and microwave to minimize how often your son disrupts her sleep???", "Yta and so is your son and his gf. If she has to sleep in the leaving cause your son knock up his gf and they can't support there family the least the can do is not turn on the lights at night where she's sleeping to get food. How about you just switch rooms with the kids your son and his family  go in to living room. Your daughter is just legal age your sons on his 20 with his own family.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that your son decided to have two children he can't provide a home for is not your daughter's fault.", "YTA.  Taking in your son, his GF and the kids is what has disrupted your household.  Your daughter has to sleep on an air mattress in the living room, and she's not allowed to be frustrated by the interruption of people invading her sleeping area at 2am or whenever they want?  I'm not sure how you can see this and it not look like you're playing favorites.  Your daughter definitely feels like she doesn't matter in this scenario.  Why can't your son and his family get their own place?  Why don't you sleep on the air mattress in the living room for a month and see how you feel?", "YTA. Your son had a child at 16, your son still lives at home and thought getting someone pregnant again was a good idea.\n\nHe needs to take responsibility and move out like a fucking adult. \n\nYour poor daughter, always second place as you enable your sons stupid choices.", "Yta\nI mean I can understand where she is coming from, she works 5 days a week and being woken up at 2am consistently would irritate anyone. A crying baby would irritate anyone and not having your own space would irritate anyone. \nShe's a legal adult so sure you don't have to have her in your house but I find it really weird that you are so quick to kick your daughter out as a teenager over something so petty instead of reaching a resolve for everyone\nI'm sure if it was up to her she would not choose to be in that horrible situation with you guys so why are you being so hard on her.", "YTA- \n\nYou've got a 18 y.o. and a 21 y.o. with two kids and another (hopefully 20y.o.) living with you...

Wow I thought my parents were bad with playing favourites but this is another level.", "YTA. She's on an airmatress in the living room, most likely trying to sleep and people are coming in and out. How can you not see why that would become annoying before long?\n\nIt also sounds like the son is the golden child, hence the gf being moved in. Your daughter will eventually move out and will go NC with you unless you apologise.", "Why haven\u2019t you taken the living room and given your daughter a bedroom?

Your 21 yr old son needs to move out of the apartment and take his gf and kids along with him. Seriously your child is sleeping in a room with zero privacy and when she complains about everyone waking her up your resolution is for her to move.

And a terrible mother.", "YTA\n\nYour son Keeps making shitty decisions that affect everyone around him but somehow he\u2019s the one that has things handed to him? \n\nYou\u2019re kicking out an 18 year who sleeps in the living room because your kid can\u2019t wrap it up and support his family. \n\nWhat is wrong with you all?", "YTA", "YTA your son and his gf can\u2019t support themselves and two kids, decided to have those kids, and you had them move in, while the solution is to have your daughter sleep in the living room where you make clear to remind her your rule apparently is for anyone to visit the kitchen at anytime, disrupting whatever sleep she can get, and you were having her pay \u201cher portion of the bills\u201d until now? It sounds like a rough situation all around, but it seems like you clearly treat your son better than you do your daughter.

Times are tough out there, especially with two kids so young. Sometimes you have to swallow Pride and do what you can. That doesn\u2019t excuse the daughter getting treated as less. Random internet strangers will judge. I hope this family comes together and figures it out.", "Wait what? I don\u2019t see anywhere saying she\u2019s pregnant again, did I miss something?", "Not only does the daughter need to get out ASAP, but it would serve everyone right if, once she has left, she quietly let the landlord know that there is an army of people living there who are not on the lease.", "I don\u2019t even think that is legal in many municipalities, it\u2019s certainly been prohibited in every lease I\u2019ve signed over the years. I think OP should worry about getting evicted.", "Ooof that\u2019s an ouch right there. Shoved her daughter out of the second room into the living room the second her son wants to come home. This OP is definitely TA!", "This, it's one of those posts where I wish it was the other person in the story posting so we could all give her some validation and advice.\n\nThat poor girl is being treated like crap.", "That's why she needs privacy. To f herself", "It depends on jurisdiction. In some areas, it would be too many occupants. In others, it may fall just under the occupancy limit.", "I\u2019d even bet her son and his gf aren\u2019t paying anything", "He\u2019s special because he\u2019s a boy and women should make sacrifices.", "OP is double the AH for charging her daughter rent to sleep on an air mattress in the living room. Shameful excuse for a mother.", "This would have been unbearable for me at 18. No privacy, respect, or dignity because only the golden son gets that.", "They had more babies lmfao. They just had sex in the car\n\nOr they\u2019d go into the other sibling rooms when they were gone", "Weeks. If OP goes through with kicking her out, the end.\n\nYTA OP", "The minute the daughter moves out, she will be no contact with her family.", "Oh yeah, an I bet the rationale is, he has two kids, they're saving for xyz", "This is also my bet", "I truly, and honestly can't even begin to fathom how her son, *is the fucking golden child?!?!?!* I have re-read this about 5 times or more over, and still can't fathom it. \n\nAt 16 he had his first child, and doesn't have custody of her, yet knocked up another woman?!? My kid would get the biggest fucking wake up call of his life if this had happened AT 16 YEARS OLD. I don't think OP understands that in most healthy families, *her son would be the massive, black sheep fuckup of the whole family*. Cousins included, and extended cousins 5 times removed. \n\nLike Thanksgiving dinner, and every holiday would consist of \"Damn, Billy knocked another one up, sad he can't figure out how to use a condom.\" I just... the cognitive dissonance to take his side still after him proving himself to be so incapable is truly fucking wild.\n\nThe poor fucking daughter, it seems like no matter how hard she works to be seen as worthwhile her shitty son some how has the highest status despite the more terrible life choices.", "Yah I mean I understand people get hungry late at night. The brother should invest in a mini fridge for the room to make compromises with his sister. It sounds like OP is treating the children differently. I also second the \u201cwhy not just get a three bedroom at this point?\u201d With the combined income of the 18 year old and the mom it should be enough,  not counting the brother and his GF. I think OP is great letting her son, gf and two kids move in. That begs the question though, the daughter is 18 legally but 18 is still a child in my opinion. Legally, no, but for all other purposes this person probably doesn\u2019t work a job where they can afford a place on their own, they don\u2019t have the credit built up to qualify etc. The mother should see the daughter and son as equals, despite the current situation of the son. He should honestly have a fire under his butt and his gf too in order to care for the kids and themselves. I just feel like there\u2019s more information needed, on the face of what we did get the daughter is definitely getting the short end of the stick and kicking her out rather than finding compromises is what makes OP asshole.", "My mom was emotionally abusive and I don't talk to her now as an adult, and even *she* gave me and my brother our own rooms and slept in the living room when we were in a 2 bedroom apartment. YTA OP", "Ok, I misread it. Still the \"mom\" needs to spring for a vasectomy for the son, since he clearly can't keep it wrapped.", "In another comment, OP said the son & GF aren\u2019t on the lease so I hope the daughter squeals to the landlord when she leaves.\n\nETA: OP, YTA obvi", "Oh god. Poor girl\u2026 that\u2019s genuinely disgusting that she\u2019s being treated like that", "I bet the mother is raising the sons babies.", "Even if the 5yo doesn't live with them it's pretty likely that she visits on some kind of schedule. That might be why the language around that sounds a little ambiguous. Still, even part time is an extra mental load for poor daughter. Also, I wonder how often she gets asked to watch them, and do they offer to pay or is it just expected of her?", "Hahaha. I mean for real, though! If you\u2019re going to have kids, you\u2019re going to have to sacrifice some stuff. I was one of a butt-load of kids but we always had a room, even if shared. \n\nAs a parent now, I\u2019d be goddamned if I made a child of mine sleep on the couch while I had an entire damn room to myself. OP is a selfish parent.", "Right, because \"think of the children!\".", "I wonder if it's 'my son has two young kids who are my grandkids to take care so he can't contribute financially, it wouldn't be right for them to pay me so I'll make my childless daughter pay instead'.", "Also I can't be sure it's the same where they live, but where I live, and many other places, you can legally only have 5 people in a 2bd place.  2 in each bedroom, one in the living room.  So daughter might not only be getting screwed on the living situation, the brother might be making the living situation illegal.", "Came here to say this.", "OMG! Nooooooooo!!!! Lmao", "Most landlords won\u2019t let more then three or four people live in a two bedroom home. So if OP is renting she could get in so much trouble. OP why don\u2019t you share your room with daughter or put son and his kids and girlfriend in the living room.", "Seriously, these days moving out with little notice or plan at 18 is very hard. When I had to 5 ish years ago my only options were scary/illegal/nasty room rentals, creepy guys, or 5000$+ deposits for rare shitholes in the wall.\n\nNot to mention this is basically a death sentence for any hopes of going back to school.", "YTA Xs 1000. I\u2019m having a hard time believing this is real. This is literally the most obvious YTA I think I\u2019ve ever read. I feel sad for this daughter. How is a Mother so blind to how bad they\u2019re being in a very simple and straightforward situation? I hope the daughter leaves and never looks back.", "Considering 40-21=19, OP is probably happy he's following in her footsteps and mad that daughter doesn't want to do the same.", "Dude needs a vasectomy as a Christmas present\u2026", ">As a parent now, I\u2019d be goddamned if I made a child of mine sleep on the couch while I had an entire damn room to myself. OP is a selfish parent.\n\nNo. Fucking. Doubt.", "Exactly. They matter. Son and gf matter. But who cares about her daughter. She can just deal with everything. No complaints allowed.", "I bet you\u2019re right!!!", "I\u2019m guessing there are 2 baby mamas", "OP should have had a backbone and stood up for their daughter and told the son there's no space for him to come back...", "Yeah, this whole situation is pretty ridiculous. Not only is she putting her daughter in a shitty situation she's also putting her in danger.", "Yeah, the Mom is so blind to the situation it's ridiculous. She's probably worried about setting rules with her precious golden Child because she might not get to see her grand babies.", "Seriously. Stop having kids you can\u2019t afford.", "And in all that time, no effort was made to carve out a space, hang blankets, etc. No effort at all to make the space more her own. For a teenage girl???", "It\u2019s a wonder the five year old was procreated in the first place with such little privacy", "Which also means it\u2019s all the adults walking her up with kitchen lights. Not a hungry little kid like the post wording implied.", "And, if he's got a two month old son, and another baby one on the way, that adds up to three baby mamas.", "Yeah this situation is horrible, she's right to complain... if they didn't have a room for the son and baby they shouldn't have let them come home. The daughter was already there..."]}
