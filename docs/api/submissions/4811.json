I am on mobile so please forgive any formatting issues.\n\nI\u2019ll (30f) start this by saying that my ex-husband (34m) has been a part of our sons (8m, 7m) lives inconsistently. About 3.5 months ago, he broke up with his girlfriend and got evicted. He told me that he was couch surfing and couldn\u2019t take our sons on his weekends. Ok, cool, no problem. I\u2019ve let him know that he can still see the boys but not overnight because I don\u2019t want them at random peoples houses. He agreed because they wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to sleep. He\u2019s ended up not seeing them at all because he tells me he can\u2019t get them.\n\nLast night he texted me asking when his next weekend is. I told him that it was Christmas Eve weekend but I had plans to go see my older sister. He then asked about seeing them this Sunday. I said that\u2019s fine as long as they\u2019re not sick (Flu has hit our house). He said that him and his girlfriend and he thought he could take the boys for a couple hours. I then said that I\u2019d prefer if he took them just by himself without introducing someone new just yet. He then proceeded to say that he can\u2019t get them then. I said ok and that was the end of the conversation.\n\nNow however, I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole for saying that I\u2019d want him to spend that time with them by himself because he hasn\u2019t seen them in 3.5 months.

What you're doing is providing stability in your children's lives.  Your ex is providing the opposite.  And think about it for a moment.  He'd rather pass up an opportunity to see his kids (who he hasn't seen in 3.5 months) than to tell his new gf that he'd like a couple of hours alone with his kids.  In no way are you the AH here.", "NTA at all. I think it is a pretty common, and reasonable boundary, to not introduce partners to children so quickly. Relationships can be pretty fickle, and who's to say this one lasts? Having rotating people in and out of children's lives is never healthy.", "NTA. Your ex is not stable and for children as young as yours still, that can be traumatising. Wanting to introduce someone he's maybe been seeing for at least 6 months or longer is understandable, but if this is someone who is completely new he needs to wait to introduce them. You have the best interest of your children in mind and that's what matters. It's unfortunate that your ex can't seem to get himself together and doesn't seem to understand that his kids should be more important than whoever his current partner is.", "NTA\n\nIs this a new girlfriend or did he get back with the prior one?\n\nHe's a terrible dad, though, for not seeing the kids because he can't have his gf there.", "NTA - Your children don't need to meet a string of girlfriends, get attached to them  abd then be devastated when they break up. If she's serious enough (been around 6+ mo) that's a little different.\n\nThere was a post here just yesterday or the day before from a young woman whose mother kept bringing home BFs. When she finally ended up marrying one the poster had no relationship with her now step-dad because she was over the song and dance.", "NTA you put forward a preference of yours and he was the one to shut it down. if he really wants to see them he'll make it happen regardless of whether his gf is there or not. you're a good mom watching out for your kids", "NTA.. \n\nOP, custody situations can be tricky for everyone involved.  \n\nI think it was 100% reasonable to ask him to spend time with them alone. Sounds like this is a new girlfriend, and it's never a good idea to introduce kids to a new SO right away. Especially when the other parent has shown a clear pattern of bad decision making. \n\nIs it possible for him to see the kids at your house? Depending on the situation and how you feel, you could leave him there with the kids for a few hours while you go shopping or grab lunch or something.  \n\nHe needs to work on himself and his situation. That being said, when my ex husband and I split up we had a custody agreement in place. A few years later things changed, he was making poor decisions, and I called him out on it and said we're not doing this, get it together, and then we'll figure it out. I wouldn't leave the kids with him for a while. \n\nHe got his shit together, and I moved heaven and earth to make sure he saw his kids as often as possible.  I refused court ordered child support so he could get a car and pick them up, I did anything and everything I could to help him because my kids having their dad in their life was extremely important to me, him and of course to the kids. \n\nLooking out for your kids best interest is never a bad thing. Doing spiteful things to hinder the relationship would be bad, but it seems like you're genuinely looking out for thr kids as well as wanting to make sure the kids and their dad have a good relationship. Maybe once things settle down and go back to normal you guys can discuss timeliness for introducing new SO's? \n\nI wish you the best of luck!", "I'm going to say NTA.  It sounds like it was a request, not an order.  Had you told him your preference and he wanted to see them anyway with her and you refused, perhaps you would have been the AH.  It seems to me you are just looking out for the best interest of your children.", "NAH. It's totally understandable you don't want your kids with someone they (and you) don't know, you're protecting your children. Your ex-husband backed down and respected your wishes, which is a really great thing.\n\nIs there a solution where he could just visit your place so he's still able to see them without necessarily taking them with him?", "NAH but I\u2019m confused by your comment, you intend on taking the boys to see your sister but stipulated that he can\u2019t have them Sunday if they are sick. \n\nWhy are you going to your sisters house if the flu has already hit your house? Why are you putting them at risk? Seems strange.\n\nEither way you are Not the AH, but neither is he in this seperate situation as he respected your wishes.. but his still a shitty dad for choosing a girlfriend over his own kids.", "Gentle ESH. You're not wrong in preferring that your kids not meet some random new gf because yes, that can be hard for kids of divorced parents. And he made a choice based on your preference, it's not like you completely told him no.\n\n**However,** depending on your custody agreement, if it's his weekend he has a right to his kids. You can't control who else is there with him on his custody days. Also, your kids would probably want to see their dad anyway, and they should be old enough to meet dad's gf and not have some major issue with it.", "**NTA**\n\nUnder other circumstances I might say to cut him a break and try to facilitate time with your sons as much as possible, because seeing their dad regularly and consistently is obviously best for them. But it seems like there has already been a lot of upheaval and inconsistency, your boys are young, and the last thing they need is to have another stranger thrown into the mix at this point, making things awkward and potentially uncomfortable. They need time JUST with their dad, particularly since they haven't had much in recent months.\n\nAnd if the issue was that his girlfriend was his transportation, assuming that they're local, he could have asked HER to do him a favour and drop him off and pick him up. it's not her job, but it would be the kind thing to do if your new boyfriend is a dad and struggling to see his kids. \n\nIt sounds like you're not being petty, just trying to manage a difficult situation in a way that supports your kids' well being. NTA.", "ESH. He is unreliable and really needs to sort a roof over his head if he wants to set up regular time with his kids. That should be his main focus.\n\nThat being said, you don't get to withhold custody because you dont like the idea of him introducing them to a new gf.", "NAH\n\nBut Either you want your kids to have a relationship with him or you don't. If this is a long term girlfriend, what is the harm? He's not arguing with you about this but he can't see his kids because of his situation. But it's Christmas, and him wanting them for a few yours and his only ride being his girlfriend should be understandable. Bc your kids later in life will wonder why he didn't fight more and he can say I tried but your mom said this (which is true) and they will be upset. Like I get it but honestly what else do you want here if he is unable to do it on his own right now?", "I\u2019m going with ESH.\n\nYour ex is clearly an AH for not making an effort to see his kids. He\u2019s also an AH for introducing random women to the kids when it\u2019s not serious. I think it\u2019s nuts to be introducing a new GF of less than 6 mos. \n\nThat said, while you didn\u2019t make a demand but stated a preference (which is fine), you have to remember that you can\u2019t control what he does in his time. And I\u2019m guessing the kids would have preferred to see him vs not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He COULD do FaceTime with the kids. Same way he knows how to call you, he can call your phone and talk to the boys. You\u2019re not a bad person for wanting him to NOT introduce his kids to his new girlfriend. It\u2019s important that he figures out that relationship and sorts out his life before introducing the kids to the GF.  If she\u2019s a 2 week thing, the kids don\u2019t need to meet her.", "NTA. Your ex clearly needs to get a few things back on track, his absence, living situation and new girlfriend will all be jarring to kids if presented simultaneously. Spending time with his own kids, on his own, comes first. Arguably with the mention of a new gf a little later down the line before actually meeting the new gf.\n\n\nIt feels like you're protecting your kids from topics that he is not equipped to navigate.", "NAH. I think you\u2019re trying to protect your children and he respected that. It\u2019s also respectful that he mentioned her and asked. I found out about my ex\u2019s brand new gf from my four year old who had been hanging out with her \ud83d\ude43", "op=NTA\n\nit is absolutely appropriate to not be introducing new people constantly to your children.\n\nIf he broke up with last \"girlfriend\" 3.5 months ago and has been couch surfing since then then he's not been with her long enough to be a girlfriend he should be introducing to his children.\n\nHold the line.\n\nPS I think your Ex may be that lovely term, Hobosexual--a person who goes from partner to partner bartering the relationship(polite term) for housing(and other benefits).  Would you agree that he fits this pattern?", "What's the conflict?  This post ends with everyone agreeing on everything.", "NTA, you just don\u2019t want a random person in their life every 3 months. It\u2019s inappropriate to introduce a partner to your child if you aren\u2019t serious and in a stable relationship. You never know what a person can do to your children when the parents aren\u2019t around (even for 5 minutes).", "Y W B T A for insisting. Choices were made that led to some unpleasant realities in this situation. You end up not having as much control over what your kids are exposed to in split family homes.\n\nNAH for making a preference known and him making a choice to respect that, though. \n\nI just hope the additional friction doesn't lead to him eventually just dropping attempts. You don't really have control over if he's that sort of man, however.", "NTA,\n\nIf he wanted to make seeing your kids a priority, then he'd probably see them more often, even if they are short visits of a few hours.  It's not hard to find a few hours every now and then out of MONTHS, and that's setting the bar very low.", "I might be wrong but it sounds like it's the GF with the car. He couldn't get them from hers before, now he has a GF he can but only if she's with him?", "As far as I know, this is a new gf. He hasn\u2019t said anything about getting back with his ex-gf.", "I\u2019ve had the plans for a while to go see my sister. As of right now, my daughter and I are the only ones with the flu. If they end up getting it, then we won\u2019t go.

Rent a car, call an Uber, do something!  Everything else is just excuses.", "I think so too.  If she is the ride, he really doesn't have a choice.  NAH.", "But you do know flu symptoms can take a few days to show and also be contagious before the symptoms appear\u2026 so either way you are risking your sister and whoever\u2019s else health by going. \n\nEh your choice but I would be pissed if you came and then a day or two later your sons start showing symptoms.", "Agreed he is a AH in the grand scheme of things, but in this scenario no. He asked to have the kid on Sunday, op said no if he isn\u2019t going to be alone and he respected that. He could of lied and said yes then had his girlfriend around but he didn\u2019t.\n\nWe aren\u2019t here to vote on if his an AH overall outside of this situation, just here to vote on the situation presented.", "It's not her place to state a preference over who is with her ex while he has his kids unless that person is likely to be neglectful or abusive. By doing so, it's manipulating the conditions under which he can see them. It's not outrightly withholding, but it is a means of subtle control.", "I\u2019d be inclined to call him back and say something like \u201chey, I\u2019ve been thinking about the visit. The kids really miss you and while I would prefer you not be introducing them to a GF of just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s more important that they see you. So if you want to come get them, let\u2019s set a time.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s still an AH but at least if you keep that door open, he can\u2019t be telling the kids later that mom didn\u2019t let him see them.", "The fact that THAT suggestion was all it took to make him retract his request means his heart isn't even in it. Don't waste a second feeling guilty about this.", "Yeah, she picked a less than ideal person to procreate with, for sure. I could have said, ESH...but things are how they are now.", "My mom picked me up on rollerskates once! I thought it was the coolest thing in the world, and had no clue she lost her license until years later.", "Take a bus even!", "I'm not saying it's right or what I would do, just that appears that way from what I read", "Everything cost money, he\u2019s probably trying to stabilize his life , his gf probably is more stable and is making it easier and quicker for him.  it\u2019s not up to op if and when he brings his gf around does she make sense yes but it\u2019s not her mistake to make she will still be the more stable one to her kids and provide that for them even if their dad doesn\u2019t all she did is make the kids and dad loose an opportunity to see each other YTA", "He can't uber/lyft/taxi, take a bus, walk?  He has options to get to his kids, he choose not to.  \n\nHe got \"evicted\" from his last place with GF 3.5 months ago.  So where's his money? to pay for a place to stay(since he's been couch surfing)\n\nSo we know Ex doesn't have a car, doesn't have a home.  Looks like GF is his next chance at continued room/board without having to pay a darn thing again.\n\nPS I bet he's paying zilch in child support.", "I didn\u2019t think about how long it can\u2019t take for symptoms to show. I know that they don\u2019t have it as of right now because they got tested when my daughter and I did. I\u2019ll talk to my sister and see how she feels about it. Then go from there. If she\u2019d prefer we don\u2019t go, then we won\u2019t go.", "hmm i see your point. i think i agree with you, thanks for taking the time to develop and not attacking me LOL", "I might just do that! I know they really miss him and ask all the time about when they\u2019re going to see him next. I\u2019ve been calling him so they can talk to him, but I\u2019ll call him and see if we can get something worked out.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!! These are OPs kids and they need a reliable and stable relationship with their FATHER not his GF. Now, if he had been around and if they had been together for like 6+ months then I'd be fine but he hasn't been around and it's clear his life is in shambles. If OP went to court for full custody she would win with the way he's been acting.", "Sorry, not trying to come off as being rude or anything.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just still annoyed that my sister invited my family to her house and didn\u2019t tell us that my nephew had covid whilst we were there, then my daughter tested positive a few days later.", "It\u2019s reddit so I understand that point but silly to attack someone over that lol. All good either way.", "No! You didn\u2019t come off as rude. You gave me a perspective I didn\u2019t think about because I was figuring we would be over it by then and they\u2019re not positive now.
