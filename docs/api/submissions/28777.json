You give freely and willingly out of love and just because it ended doesn't mean that it gets returned to the gifter. If that's the case, might as well have a disclaimer with every gift like \"here's this bracelet for you to enjoy as long as we're together. If we break up, you have to give it back\". So romantic (please note the sarcasm). \n\nHe also didn't pay for those tickets as it was with points. So to demand cash is extra petty especially since he's cheap and \"broke\". Some airline point systems allow you to transfer points to others. Can you do that with these? If not, they're yours.", "NTA.  you truly don't owe him anything.  in fact you gave him concert tickets.  i'd block his number to avoid any further drama from unfolding & just move on.", "NTA.\n\nHe might not have gone in with this intent, but at this point he's just trying to convert expiring frequent flyer miles into cash. The airline won't do that, why should you?\n\nYou don't owe him anything for a gift you didn't ask for and maybe won't ever even use. He sounds bitter and/or greedy.", "Nta.  It was a gift.", "NTA\n\nyou owe him nothing", "NTA - you went to a lot more trouble than most would to try to get him the credits back. Take a trip somewhere fun when you can!", "NTA. This is an unfortunate situation in which he incurred a cost banking on a future of the relationship that didn't materialize. Too bad he lost out but it's not your fault he did. If he'd bought you a gift he could not return, the situation would be the same and you would not owe him for the cost of that gift.\n\nAlso it's not really possible to say definitively what the dollar value of the points really were because flight prices change all the time, by the day or hour, not to mention there is quite likely a 'secret' formula that airlines use to determine point value.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe him anything. It was his choice to use the points on a ticket for you. You were also kind enough to give him the concert tickets that you had purchased. You could have easily tried to cancel them and get your money back, or gone with someone else.", "NTA. You covered costs if dates \u2026 he essentially gave you the ticket as a gift and you argued that it should go to his family instead. You don\u2019t owe him a thing. You gave it your best effort to get him a refund it\u2019s not your fault the ticket can\u2019t be transferred. Let it go. You did your best.", "NTA\n\nI think him trying to get you to pay him out for the ticket that cost him nothing is just another example of him being greedy. Glad you're not with him anymore.", "All I\u2019m seeing is thank god he\u2019s an ex", "NTA. You owe him nothing. He made the choice to spend his points like that.", "NTA. You owe him nothing.

He insisted you take it, so you took it. Now he wants to be paid back. Well, doesn\u2019t work that way, buddy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s your ex. Who cares what he thinks, likes, or wants?

He knew the risks, and just because you broke up he has no legal or ethical right to ask for cash because he's neither out any money nor was he going to get taxed on the rewards miles he used for the free ticket.  He was just looking for some free cash from you because he wasn't going to get it from the airlines.  Just enjoy the credit to be used later for something else and learn your lesson when you come across another \"broke down\" guy.", "NTA. You don't pay someone for something they got free.

He was taking advantage of you every way he could, and you should be glad to get out of that situation.

You didn't want them in the first place, and he only \"purchased\" them because the credits were about to expire anyways.", "No, I know. I'm just saying.", "I disagree with your assessment that 'flight credits \\[...\\] essentially cost him nothing.' This might be a bit nit-picky, but most clearly they DO have a value (as can been seen by the fact the airline is willing to give you tickets when you pay with them), and most of the time you only get them by choosing to do something slightly sub-optimally (like a credit card that gives flight credits vs. cash-back, like flying a specific airline instead of the cheapest for this trip, ...).\n\nSometimes it's your employer that suffers this sub-optimally, sometimes it's you directly, but you almost always pay for it in some form or another.\n\nNow, with that said, you're still NTA. No airline allows to exchange reward points for cash, so you should not do that either. You even called the airline and tried to give him his credit back!More than I would have expected you to do, more than what I would have done in your situation. Use them if you can, don't stress about it if you can't, and hopefully next time you date someone you have a better experience.", "I would probably offer a token amount or just to shut him up. Maybe half the value of the ticket or something like that. \n\nMentioning your situation however is irrelevant because it shouldn't matter if you are a mom of five kids or a rich person, whether something is right or wrong is what it is regardless of the situation. \n\nEither way he sounds super annoying. Just block his number and move on.", "NTA. We purchased tickets for our son\u2019s girlfriend to come with him on a trip to visit us. They broke up before the trip. As it was on our points we had to cancel but it still stayed in her name. We then later booked a trip for her to use the points to another destination.  You owe him nothing.", "NTA", "NTA, it's a wash deal in bookkeeping. Block him.", "NTA\n\nHe can pay money to have the points refunded if they were straight airline miles instead of credit card \"points\" and it wouldn't cost *that* much. Hell, several airlines still aren't charging the reinstatement fee after getting rid of it during covid.\n\nHe could absolutely get those miles back without hassle. He just wants money.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe him anything.", "Nta\nYou owe him nothing. Block and move on.", "NTA - They were a gft to you.  He can't get them back now.", "NTA.

You absolutely do not owe him anything.", "NTA -- you don't owe him anything. Just say \"I probably won't use them\" which is exactly what he said to you when he shoved a freebie in your face.\n\nTell him you more than compensated him for his $0 outlay on the tickets with the band tickets.", "NTA.  Once a gift is given the recipient can do with it as s/he wishes.  Block him.  Even if he tried to sue he'd have no leg to stand on.

As I said to a pp, I didn\u2019t mean the rewards points cost him nothing, I meant there was no additional out of pocket expense to use them to acquire the tickets", "If he does, OP is gonna win and I want her to counter sue for emotional distress and for all the money she spent on court stuff. That might reset his rotten brain", "He actually can\u2019t as they are no longer points. The points would be expired now."]}
