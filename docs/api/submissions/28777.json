You give freely and willingly out of love and just because it ended doesn't mean that it gets returned to the gifter. If that's the case, might as well have a disclaimer with every gift like \"here's this bracelet for you to enjoy as long as we're together. If we break up, you have to give it back\". So romantic (please note the sarcasm). \n\nHe also didn't pay for those tickets as it was with points. So to demand cash is extra petty especially since he's cheap and \"broke\". Some airline point systems allow you to transfer points to others. Can you do that with these? If not, they're yours.", "NTA.  you truly don't owe him anything.  in fact you gave him concert tickets.  i'd block his number to avoid any further drama from unfolding & just move on.", "NTA.\n\nHe might not have gone in with this intent, but at this point he's just trying to convert expiring frequent flyer miles into cash. The airline won't do that, why should you?\n\nYou don't owe him anything for a gift you didn't ask for and maybe won't ever even use. He sounds bitter and/or greedy.", "Nta.  It was a gift.", "NTA\n\nyou owe him nothing", "NTA - you went to a lot more trouble than most would to try to get him the credits back. Take a trip somewhere fun when you can!", "NTA. This is an unfortunate situation in which he incurred a cost banking on a future of the relationship that didn't materialize. Too bad he lost out but it's not your fault he did. If he'd bought you a gift he could not return, the situation would be the same and you would not owe him for the cost of that gift.\n\nAlso it's not really possible to say definitively what the dollar value of the points really were because flight prices change all the time, by the day or hour, not to mention there is quite likely a 'secret' formula that airlines use to determine point value.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe him anything. It was his choice to use the points on a ticket for you. You were also kind enough to give him the concert tickets that you had purchased. You could have easily tried to cancel them and get your money back, or gone with someone else.", "NTA. You covered costs if dates \u2026 he essentially gave you the ticket as a gift and you argued that it should go to his family instead. You don\u2019t owe him a thing. You gave it your best effort to get him a refund it\u2019s not your fault the ticket can\u2019t be transferred. Let it go. You did your best.", "NTA\n\nI think him trying to get you to pay him out for the ticket that cost him nothing is just another example of him being greedy. Glad you're not with him anymore.", "All I\u2019m seeing is thank god he\u2019s an ex", "NTA. You owe him nothing. He made the choice to spend his points like that.", "NTA. You owe him nothing. Especially given that you paid for so many things in the relationship. If you want to be petty, write up a list of all those things and tell him to deduct the cost of the ticket from the amount he owes you.", "That ticket or flight credit or whatever it is now\u2026it\u2019s yours, gifted to you by your ex. He insisted you take it, so you took it. Now he wants to be paid back. Well, doesn\u2019t work that way, buddy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s your ex. Who cares what he thinks, likes, or wants? Block his number and don\u2019t look back. NTA", "NTA you owe him nothing. It\u2019s not like he can sue you for this.", ">This cost him zero money out of pocket.\n\nWell no it didn't. He had to have made enough purchases to get this reward. But, he gave you those tickets. They don't suddenly just become something you owe him for just because you two broke up. \n\nNTA. \n\nCan't you just purchase him a ticket with those credits?", "OP I call BS on this.  He knew the risks, and just because you broke up he has no legal or ethical right to ask for cash because he's neither out any money nor was he going to get taxed on the rewards miles he used for the free ticket.  He was just looking for some free cash from you because he wasn't going to get it from the airlines.  Just enjoy the credit to be used later for something else and learn your lesson when you come across another \"broke down\" guy.", "NTA. You don't pay someone for something they got free.
