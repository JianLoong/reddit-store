On the other hand, I also get why she is peeved. I\u2019d try to explain it to her like \u201cHoney, I meant no disrespect. I look at this spot everyday and find it relaxing and comforting to look at this beautiful artwork you made for me.\u201d \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t come around, I\u2019m sorry.", "NAH\n\nI understand her thought process is probably \"he put my painting that I put a lot of time, effort, and love in right about a toilet? Really?\"\n\nBut, I never thought about this as a woman before, but \"above the toilet\" art is totally a thing with guys. My husband put a painting above ours, and I was always like \"well that's super weird\".\n\nSo many of his guy friends would come over, and be like \"oh man I love the painting in your bathroom!\"", "NAH. Your reasoning makes sense, but so does hers. She worked hard on it and putting it above the toilet not only exposes it to bacteria, but also humidity from showering that could deteriorate it.", "If you really mean what you say, NAH\u2026 but dude\u2026 \\*facepalm\\*", "NAH. I can understand your reasoning because I too, have a painting above the toilet. However, your girlfriend probably worked hard on the painting and must be feeling that her work is not being fully appreciated. Whatever the logistics is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to move the painting somewhere more suitable for her because this isn\u2019t worth something to fight over.", "Man, I hope you framed her art or took some other measure to shield it from humidity, sharticles and the like.", "NAH\n\nI get why she is upset, I get why you did it. Communicate and compromise.", "I'm not gonna even bother reading\n\nYou are not an asshole\n\nBut damn you're as sharp as a marble", "I'm going to go with NAH.  Listen, I actually think your reasoning makes sense.  But I completely understand her being upset by it.  I mean, you stuck it by the toilet, not really great...", "I can understand why you put it there but I can also see why she took offence. Maybe putting it above the toilet wasn't the best move but I can understand wanting to appreciate it there", "Sorry man, this made me laugh because at the office I always post important notes above the toilet since that's how I can be sure they'll be seen and read. \n\nProbably not the most tactful thing to do with a painting she worked hard on though, so mild yta.", "Yikes. Your intent is wonderful, your logic is rock-solid, but man, there is no way she's going to appreciate being toilet-adjacent.\n\nIn reality NAH, but to her (which is important), YTA for this for eternity.", "Man, I hope you framed her art or took some other measure to shield it from humidity, sharticles and the like.", "NAH. Your logic is sound but it's not something she will ever understand or feel comfortable with. Could you compromise and put it on the wall across from your bed, or the ceiling above your bed, maybe?", "YTA This was a gift that she spent a lot of time on and lovingly gave to you. You decided that it was so special it should be above the toilet so you could see it \u201cevery time you took a piss.\u201d What is wrong with you??", "Ya I'm gonna say YTA here because putting it just above the toilet? \n\nSo your girlfriend worked hard on making you a painting of the two of you for Christmas and that's how you show your appreciation? My goodness.", "No one wants you to appreciate their art while you are peeing. YTA.", "YTA do better.", "YTA but good lord you made me laugh \ud83d\ude02 keep it up", "I know that you consider above the toilet as the most looked at place in the house, but why not consider a living room, or bedroom?  Putting it in the bathroom tends to send the wrong message.\n\nYou'll get a small YTA since there wasn't any malicious intent, just not an ideal place to hang a painting", "NTA but i can see why that would be her gut reaction. Did you explain to her why? Did she listen to you? It's a miscommunication but how you both deal with it will determine if your relationship will last.", "Troll.  But funny.", "lol okay your logical reasoning here is pretty funny. I wish I could give you the benefit of doubt but unfortunately it should just be way to obvious to any reasonable person why putting a prized painting above the toilet might garner some offense. YTA", "YTA for the reason you worded it. It made me laugh but you basically said that you were only going to appreciate her art while you're taking a piss... Doesn't send the best message.", "YTA, ew.  Did you stop to consider the painting could be damaged by the humidity in the bathroom?  Was that really the only place you could think of hanging her artwork.  Gf now thinks you consider her artwork to be on the same level as a toilet.", "NTA as your reasoning is solid - you do look at that wall a lot. However, I would worry about the moisture in the room if your toilet is in with your bath/shower.", "I don\u2019t know if women truly understand how often we look at that wall. It was a huge complement but I understand that she probably can\u2019t see it that way. Maybe just show her the comments to this thread or something \nNTA", "\"even though it\u2019s the most looked at wall in the house\"\n\nshit posts are worst posts.", "NAH because your logic is believable and funny\ud83d\ude05 it made me laugh, thank you for a more lighthearted AITA. just explain that to her and hopefully she\u2019ll get it! I understand being hurt without knowing why because it is a bathroom and people associate it with gross stuff lol. Hopefully she\u2019ll get it once you explain! Your heart was in the right place but offer to move it if she wants maybe?", "YTA. A portrait of your GF above the toilet where your pissing and you don\u2019t see a problem??? It\u2019s like you are pissing on her. OMG. YTA. Use some common sense for gosh sakes!", "YTA for peeing while standing up in a house toilet and possibly getting AoE damage on her painting.", "NAH.\n\nGuys think totally different about home decoration than gals. She probably put her heart and soul into that painting, and fully expected to see it in the living room only to see it above the toilet. \n\nTake the thing off, and put it in a prominent place where everyone can see and admire it the moment they come through the door. And next time ask her where to put a painting.", "NTA! It\u2019s your house. Also, I have a nice framed photo from my wedding above my toilet that I get to stare at multiple times a day and it makes me happy. Have you explained this to her?", "NTA. I fully get your logic and reason and tbh I would\u2019ve done the same. I get where they\u2019re coming from through, best I can suggest is just move it to the second best place you can think of and apologize and just explain (though I assume you have already) you didn\u2019t mean any disrespect just wanted something cool to look at while taking a piss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Personally I have put my own art in the bathroom nor do I care if people who have purchased or been gifted my stuff stick it in their bathroom or kitchen. So I'm unsure if it's a perceived commentary on value, possible physical degradation of the piece (and therefore disrespect of the work) or some other reason, but I remember my first art professor complaining to me about a buyer commenting to their partner about her work would look great in their bathroom at a recent gallery showing. Her works were pretty serious in nature and she was serious about them, but over the years I have heard that complaint from more than several professionals. Now that you know this it is worth considering. Also be aware that she may consider her pieces a chunk or extension of her self and that she may be most excited about her most recent pieces vs older themes she's moved on from, so to speak.\n\n\nedit: buyer, not but*", "HA, this is exactly the type of thing I'd be mad at until it was explained to me. It's kind of sweet in a funny way. It's your way of saying you want to look at it every single day, and not many places have a grand fireplace/mantle to hang a masterpiece.\n\nNAH, because I think it does come across as strange to think \"wow, I love this art! I will place it in the same room where we poop\"\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what kind of painting it is or if it's framed in glass, but be mindful of the humidity in the bathroom and how it could degrade the painting over time.", "NAH. i think this is a case of boys are mars, girls are from venus.  you took a utilitarian approach to your placement of the painting, but i can understand where most women wouldn't be too happy about it.", "NAH but did you explain your thinking to her?", "NAH I put a photograph I took and framed above the toilet...I always assumed people put some type of art above the toilet, never considered it to be insulting. I can kinda see why is is mad, but I see your point as well...move it if it means that much to her I guess.", "If OP doesn't understand or appreciate the symbolism here, then he's YTA.  Talk about insulting your girlfriend.", "NAH but ty for the chuckle. Here\u2019s a compromise: put up the portrait in your bedroom so it\u2019s the first thing you see in the morning and the last thing you see at night.

I would say N A H but if she was actually \u201cfurious\u201d about it, and wouldn\u2019t listen to or care about your reasoning, that\u2019s selfish and ignorant.", "YTA. Anyone with common sense would know that was a very stupid thing to do. Why not put the painting in the trash and sent your GF a picture. That's the kind of message that putting the painting on the crapper sends. C'mon son!", "YTA Perhaps for you the bathroom is a place of peace and tranqility, happy memories , joy, honour - not a place for defication and bad smells\n\nImagine you gave her something you cherished - your fav computer game or only golf trophy and she has a room where she changes her tampons.  She put your cherished gift in the room where she changes her tampons / towels, telling you its the room where she spends most time ....\n\nI don't hear of people keeping their sporting trophys in the john but perhaps that's where all ice hockey cups and boxing belts are displayed and I didn't know.  Do the great musicians have a shelf where they put all Grammy's / Oscars but not in the main living rooms / trophy cases but the jacks?\n\nShe is dating you 3 years and didn't realize your thought process.", "Dude. You put her painting above the toilet? NTA but you might be a little dense lol. I can see your logic but a woman wouldn\u2019t see it the same way.

I can see why you chose to put it there, I think it\u2019s fine and pretty common but I can also see why she wouldn\u2019t like it, maybe she felt like it was somewhat hidden or associated toilet with something dirty.

However that bit of wall is probably the wall that you stare at the most. So solid reasoning.", "NTA, really, unless your gf cannot get past it. \n\n I put a pastel our daughter drew of a vacation spot next to the toilet in the main bath. I can't see it from the toilet, but I see it every time I leave the shower\n\nI have, also, put something I have to keep on the powder room wall bc I cannot easily look right there. \n\nSo, I guess that's a push!", "OMG, this is freaking hilarious. I can't even. . .", "I\u2019m a woman and my favorite piece of art also lives in the bathroom because it fits the best in there.\n\nI understand why she\u2019d be put off, it sounds like you are genuine in wanting to put it in a place you\u2019ll see it often.

And no, you are not the asshole. If your girlfriend had a healty ego, she wouldn\u2019t care where her painting is hanging. She should be upset if you threw it to the bin, yes.

Because everyone poops and pees, what\u2019s wrong with that?", "So... how did you imagine her reaction?\n\n\\*OP has girlfriend cover her eyes and walks her to the bathroom. Directs girlfriend to look. She does and her art is hanging above the toilet. Girlfriend is overjoyed and tells OP she always imagined her art would someday hang above a toilet.\\*\n\nYTA", "NTA. Her reasoning is invalid. It\u2019s a gift. You hang it where you want. And even if she\u2019s not a guy it\u2019s totally common sense that men pee standing. That\u2019s why urinals and separate bathrooms exist. Your girl sounds ridiculous", "Yeah, I got a good chuckle from it too.  And I understand both sides here.  It's definitely in a spot where OP and likely guests will see it!  But it's also in a room where you poo so.... time for a good talk with the GF and find a compromise!", "I don't know if I want my friend and his girlfriend to be watching me pee. It's not like I get performance anxiety or anything but what if their eyes followed you?", "I second all of this. NAH- I can see why she is upset because to her toilet = gross, but I think it\u2019s super sweet to hear you say OP will admire it all the time. And then your comment is also really cute with all the compliments \n\nMy family has always had art in the bathroom, for generations. And my aunt put my best watercolor painting I did in HS above her toilet, she is so proud of my painting and where it is, so for me personally it\u2019s nice and my aunt means it as an honor. So hopefully the OP GF reads these comments and is no longer upset", "Omg same here. My wife and I don't typically have paintings in the bathroom because we're both AFAB, but I'm dying at the awkward sweetness of \"I get to look at this painting every time I piss\" lol. That's... really sweet in a way I'd never considered before?\n\nNAH, OP. I think it's kinda cute, even though my first reaction was similar to your gf's lmao", "I mean, OP's kind of the asshole for ruining the painting.  He stuck it in a room that regularly gets quite humid; unless it's etched into glass or something, that will destroy it.", "Fair point about humidity potentially damaging it\n\nEdit: to be clear though it is framed so not like directly exposed to air.
