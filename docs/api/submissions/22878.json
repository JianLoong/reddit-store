She has a boyfriend (21M) who goes to school with us, but my bestfriend decided to go home for the summer so its just us. Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. None of us are rich but they absolutely have more money than me, and it stressed me terribly to spend $500 on a ticket anywhere. I still bought it, because she is my friend and she means a lot to me. The two of them had been planning the trip without me and I was excited to see what they'd planned. Once we all got on Facetime, I realized they planned one on one time every single day and I would be left in the city with no friends for hours on end. She didn't plan anything fun for just the two of us to do together. And on the first night, they plan to go on a walk together and leave me in the house with her parents and siblings (who I have never met) because they think the meet up would be anticlimactic if they didn't get alone time. \n\nNeedless to say, I was furious. I know I am just the friend and he is the boyfriend so he gets more time, but at the bare minimum I expected one thing blocked off for us to do. I felt like some sort of glorified travel buddy for her boyfriend and I didn't spend $500 just to do that. After the Facetime I wrote them a text letting them know I didn't think I was comfortable going anymore. I still planned to send my friend's birthday gift to her house, but I did not want to go on the trip any longer. She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.\n\nI've talked to some of my friends about this and they agree, saying I shouldn't go there just to sit in a foreign city by myself. Others have said I was too harsh and should've just toughed it out.

You say that they planned things together, did you ever contact either of them to plan anything? Maybe she could have gotten ahold of you to plan some things with you, but you definitely could have called her and made plans. It sounds like when you finally talked with her about it she said they could change plans and then that wasn\u2019t good enough for you. You felt sidelined because you sidelined yourself, then she tried to make it better. I\u2019m going to keep my judgement, but I\u2019m pretty close to talking myself into a Y-T-A.", "NTA. Who would want to spend money to be a third wheel for a week?", "NTA you friend and her boyfriend were treating you like a third wheel on a trip you had to pay for. Stay home and have fun!", "NTA. There's no point spending money that you need for a trip that you clearly won't enjoy.", "No one is the ah. She's more excited to spend time with him than you, you correctly figured that out, and you've made it so they can do that. \n\nThe best friend will likely try to rewrite history, but just hold your ground, send the present, and move on.", "NTA! If they ask you to come to the trip they should have included you in all the activities, maybe take one or two outings to go alone depending on the length of the trip. It makes no sense to spend $500 on a trip just to stay at home with a bunch of strangers.", "NTA. \n\nYou were the backup plan.", "NTA, they seem selfish and inconsiderate. \n\nIf you want to give them a second chance, you could say that you\u2019re canceling the ticket because it\u2019s not in your budget.", "Bit weird to plan a visit for you and the bf from the start. Do you often do things as the third wheel?\n\nNot the AH for not going, sounds like (from your account), that you aren't complaining about it but are being adult and using the money for something else.\n\nIt might have been possible to all organise together, doesn't sound like you were very involved there so lesson learnt.\n\nYour friend and her bf are also not the AH as they are just planning stuff. Maybe they figured you weren't fussed because you weren't involved in the plans.\n\nCommunication lesson learnt all round I think.\n\nUnless your replies change info then NAH.", "NTA.  Their relationship evolved and you now recognize you would be intruding and cancelled your ticket.  That was the wise and mature thing to do.", "NTA! She\u2019s only back peddling because she\u2019s not done using you! Tell her the truth. Your not a 3rd wheel", "NTA. If they wanted alone time they shouldnt have tagged you along. I cant imagine being okay with someone spending loads of money to see me then abandoning them with people they dont know.", "So you realize that you won\u2019t get a refund?  You only will get the credit.   I\u2019d go and make plans of your own unless you can use the points elsewhere.  Doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re much a of a traveler so I\u2019d say go.  Use them for emergencies.  House, place to stay, and make your own plans.", "NTA if you don\u2019t have it $500 is a LOT to spend on a holiday where you are going to be a third wheel.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like it wouldn\u2019t be much fun for you and that is a lot to pay to hang out with your friends family. \n\nOn the other hand, try not to let this ruin your friendship and just let her know there\u2019s no hard feelings but next time, you\u2019d rather just a trip with her and not the bf.", "NTA. They furor about you. I get wanting could time, but they completely forgot that you would still exist during that time and didn't factor you into the equation except when it was convenient. \n\nI'm not saying your friend was TA either. She just didn't think about it. But I wouldn't want to spend $500 to sit in a house full of strangers for several hours a day. \n\nHonestly, you should have been part of the planning the entire time.", "NTA but then again I don't think you're best friend was intentionally one either.  Seems like life shifted her priorities and she forgot she had a best friend, which happens and it sucks and it won't be the last time it'll happen either.\n\nI think your absolutely right to back out of this trip and honestly, of have a bit of a talk with her about how she hurt your feelings and maybe take a bit of a step back from the friendship to evaluate it, you two just might be in two different places in your life and while you'll still be friends your can acknowledge it just isn't as close in this time in your lives.", "NTA.  Doesn't sound like any fun to me. Find another time to visit her when it's just the two of you and airfares are cheaper . Hopefully,  you can get a refund on these tickets!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
