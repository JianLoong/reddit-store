She has a boyfriend (21M) who goes to school with us, but my bestfriend decided to go home for the summer so its just us. Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. None of us are rich but they absolutely have more money than me, and it stressed me terribly to spend $500 on a ticket anywhere. I still bought it, because she is my friend and she means a lot to me. The two of them had been planning the trip without me and I was excited to see what they'd planned. Once we all got on Facetime, I realized they planned one on one time every single day and I would be left in the city with no friends for hours on end. She didn't plan anything fun for just the two of us to do together. And on the first night, they plan to go on a walk together and leave me in the house with her parents and siblings (who I have never met) because they think the meet up would be anticlimactic if they didn't get alone time. \n\nNeedless to say, I was furious. I know I am just the friend and he is the boyfriend so he gets more time, but at the bare minimum I expected one thing blocked off for us to do. I felt like some sort of glorified travel buddy for her boyfriend and I didn't spend $500 just to do that. After the Facetime I wrote them a text letting them know I didn't think I was comfortable going anymore. I still planned to send my friend's birthday gift to her house, but I did not want to go on the trip any longer. She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.\n\nI've talked to some of my friends about this and they agree, saying I shouldn't go there just to sit in a foreign city by myself. Others have said I was too harsh and should've just toughed it out.

It sounds like when you finally talked with her about it she said they could change plans and then that wasn\u2019t good enough for you.

If they ask you to come to the trip they should have included you in all the activities, maybe take one or two outings to go alone depending on the length of the trip.

If you are going, paying but not getting to do what you want or have it be equally your vacation as much as it is theirs, then it makes total sense you wouldn\u2019t want to go. And after seeing what their plan is, you know what their preference for the trip is and even if they change the plans, you know they will wish they had the original and have to be in the lookout that they\u2019ll slip right back into couple mode. \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA, but I feel like the communication here is lacking between all three parties. You didn't actively plan anything with them, so maybe she didn't think you were interested in doing certain things or she didnt even do the planning but just okayed it or she might have thought that this was your style of vacationing. Sometimes, you have to speak up for yourself, not just let others do the work, or else you will be stuck with a bad time. I learned that the hard way many times, too. \n\nA lot of people don't realize that others are uncomfortable with staying at a strange house with strange people because they don't see their family as strangers, and their home is HOME to them. Some people prefer to do things like explore a new city alone (I know I love it, but also love being with the friends I'm visiting, so I do 50/50 when traveling). Your friend might not realize this about you, even if you've been friends for a while. People grow and change, too.\n\nYou are allowed to be upset and change your mind about the trip, too. $500 is way too much money to spend on a vacation where you know you won't be able to relax or enjoy yourself. \n\nBut please realize that her \"backpedaling\" may have been her realizing what happened and trying to make things right with you because she really does want you there. \n\nOf course, I'm giving both of you the benefit of the doubt here, and there is a small chance they could just suck as friends, but try communicating with her first before burning any bridges.", "info: Did she know you were coming when the bf made plans?", "[removed]", "NTA.
