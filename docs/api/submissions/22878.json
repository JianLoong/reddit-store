She has a boyfriend (21M) who goes to school with us, but my bestfriend decided to go home for the summer so its just us. Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. None of us are rich but they absolutely have more money than me, and it stressed me terribly to spend $500 on a ticket anywhere. I still bought it, because she is my friend and she means a lot to me. The two of them had been planning the trip without me and I was excited to see what they'd planned. Once we all got on Facetime, I realized they planned one on one time every single day and I would be left in the city with no friends for hours on end. She didn't plan anything fun for just the two of us to do together. And on the first night, they plan to go on a walk together and leave me in the house with her parents and siblings (who I have never met) because they think the meet up would be anticlimactic if they didn't get alone time. \n\nNeedless to say, I was furious. I know I am just the friend and he is the boyfriend so he gets more time, but at the bare minimum I expected one thing blocked off for us to do. I felt like some sort of glorified travel buddy for her boyfriend and I didn't spend $500 just to do that. After the Facetime I wrote them a text letting them know I didn't think I was comfortable going anymore. I still planned to send my friend's birthday gift to her house, but I did not want to go on the trip any longer. She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.\n\nI've talked to some of my friends about this and they agree, saying I shouldn't go there just to sit in a foreign city by myself. Others have said I was too harsh and should've just toughed it out.

Or left to spend time in a city you wouldn\u2019t have travelled to otherwise.", "NTA - going to see your friend and she doesn\u2019t plan for that? Shit, I wouldn\u2019t even be sending a gift. It\u2019s one thing to explore a city you\u2019ve been dying to travel to, all alone - it\u2019s another thing to go for the express purpose of celebrating your friend and her birthday, only to find out you\u2019re 3rd wheeling. Why did they want you to go along in the first place if they wanted \u201ccouple time\u201d?\n\nI suspect it has a lot to do with using you as a smokescreen so she can spend time with her boyfriend. Maybe her parents wouldn\u2019t have been ok with just her boyfriend coming, but with you, it\u2019s a group! (I mean I don\u2019t see why the addition of the friend would change that but who knows)\n\nRegardless, good for you for sticking up for yourself and not wasting $500. I love travel, but hate 3rd wheeling", " Go no contact", "Nobody should have to pay $500 to play third wheel for a week. Save up a little longer and go another time when it's just the two of you. NTA", "$500 when you're in college is huge. Especially when you would be bored and uncomfortable the whole time. NTA", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t go sit by myself, bored, even if she had paid for the ticket..", "NTA but if this situation comes up again in the future it\u2019s probably better to not agree to go in the first place.", "8", "NTA", "NTA,\nYou do not have to go. It is really the best option and you can still be friends. As friends, who understand, it is OK to step back in some aspects.\n\nYou are spending out of your pocket to visit disappointment.Hope you get full refund", "NAH", "NTA.  Your friend and her bf began planning without you and hadn't even considered you at all for any one on one time.  That's pretty inconsiderate for a best friend.  Spend your $500 on yourself and see how the friendship stands once school is back in session.", "NTA\n\nWhy even send her a birthday gift? Just call or text her on her birthday and decide if you want to continue your friendship with them or not.", "NTA but jeez people can mess up. You call it backpedaling but maybe it was just mildly thoughtless. They're literally changing their minds now you've expressed yourself and saying you should hang out. Trust their words and enjoy the trip.", "Three's a crowd babe, NTA.", "NTA", "Agreed 100% NTA, especially since it seems op to handle it very maturely. They didn't freak out or yell and argue, they simply said I'm not comfortable going. Let's take a moment to applaud OP for handling a delicate situation with care.", "To be clear is kind. To not be clear is very unkind. You are a kind person.  \u262e\ufe0f", "My exact thoughts! You\u2019re NTA OP!", "Good self-care! Treat yourself to something and save some money.", "IMO the friend not thinking about what one of her two guests (and her best friend to boot) was going to do for hours every day while she swanned off with her bf to do couple stuff emphatically *does* make the friend an AH.", "I disagree, the best friend and boyfriend are most certainly at least a little bit the AHs, OP wasn\u2019t even going on this trip until the boyfriend suggested they go together. There was zero reason to suggest that if best friend and boyfriend knew they wanted to spend the majority of the time alone. Clearly the best friend even realized that since she tried to backtrack and say she could make time for OP after the fact. It\u2019s never fun being made to feel like an inconvenience or an afterthought, especially when you weren\u2019t the one who made the suggestion in the first place.", "> Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. \n\nHow is it a miscommunication and how is she being a leech. When from the context provided it looks like she was originally invited and the plans started forming with the knowledge that she would be coming too?", "This just seems like poorly thought out advice, even if she doesn't have a boyfriend that in no way means that she just wants to hook up with a bunch of random strangers in order to have a place to sleep. Dude life isn't a porno.", " I get wanting couple time, but they completely forgot that you would still exist during that time and didn't factor you into the equation except when it was convenient.", "now that ur friend knows she's been caught out making you her boyfriend's flying buddy.", "Agreed... OP is mature and considerate", "Bad bot. Partial comment stolen from UnicornPanties. Report and downvote.", "I always factor in a chance for just her and I to hang out.", "bot comment", "Paying $500 for free food, I'd double check that one. From your other comments I'm guessing you're either the friend or the boyfriend since you're very committed to this. Whether you are or not, its not a big deal, she's not going and everyone agrees, grow up and get over it.", "Free embarrassments and free disappointments", "Did you book her ticket?  If not how do you know it\u2019s not refundable?  It is totally logical to get her money back for the ticket or change the dates and visit her friend alone so that friend and boyfriend can have this particular week to themselves and so can her and her friend during the rescheduled week.", "She doesn't want a threesome with you two. Get over it.", "Clearly you can't either...", "This. I don\u2019t know how you can say the friend and the boyfriend weren\u2019t AHs for inviting OP on this trip and then forgetting about her. She never had to be included in the first place if they just wanted to be alone but the boyfriend was the one who suggested she come.", "It's not fun. But clearly op has learned it's more of a one sided best friendship than she thought. That's life.", "Did I say hookup? Why does a date have to be about sex? I said go have fun. I said stay with the family, go have fun the rest of the time. Let the friend and boyfriend have the alone time they want. u/ExpertRaccoon please don't project a dirty mind on me.", "Ultimately, it's essential to surround yourself with people who respect and value you, and who take your feelings into account in their actions. Healthy relationships should be built on mutual consideration and understanding.", "Get em boys!", "Right, which makes her best friend an AH lol. My entire point was disagreeing that none of the parties are AHs. People who exclude others from plans when the excluded party spend a lot of money to spend time with them, are AHs. So are people who are inconsiderate of their friends.", "Yes, she bought the ticket the BF suggested she buy when *he* invited *her* to visit the friend together. \n\nBF shouldn't have invited someone and then planned to ditch them for so much time.", "They're not assholes. They're thoughtless. And when OP let them know they realised they'd fucked up and \"backtracked\" ie re-included their friend. Jeez if you torch every relationship you have over something like this good luck out there.", "Whatever, I\u2019m a weirdo. If I am going to travel to see someone, I am going to talk with them beforehand about what we will be doing. I\u2019m just an a-hole that way I guess. I\u2019d be a much better person if I just left it all to them. I\u2019m to old to change my ways, so I guess my friends and family will just have to put up with me communicating and not putting everything on them."]}
