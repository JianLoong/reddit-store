She has a boyfriend (21M) who goes to school with us, but my bestfriend decided to go home for the summer so its just us. Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. None of us are rich but they absolutely have more money than me, and it stressed me terribly to spend $500 on a ticket anywhere. I still bought it, because she is my friend and she means a lot to me. The two of them had been planning the trip without me and I was excited to see what they'd planned. Once we all got on Facetime, I realized they planned one on one time every single day and I would be left in the city with no friends for hours on end. She didn't plan anything fun for just the two of us to do together. And on the first night, they plan to go on a walk together and leave me in the house with her parents and siblings (who I have never met) because they think the meet up would be anticlimactic if they didn't get alone time. \n\nNeedless to say, I was furious. I know I am just the friend and he is the boyfriend so he gets more time, but at the bare minimum I expected one thing blocked off for us to do. I felt like some sort of glorified travel buddy for her boyfriend and I didn't spend $500 just to do that. After the Facetime I wrote them a text letting them know I didn't think I was comfortable going anymore. I still planned to send my friend's birthday gift to her house, but I did not want to go on the trip any longer. She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.\n\nI've talked to some of my friends about this and they agree, saying I shouldn't go there just to sit in a foreign city by myself. Others have said I was too harsh and should've just toughed it out.

Your friend might not realize this about you, even if you've been friends for a while. People grow and change, too.\n\nYou are allowed to be upset and change your mind about the trip, too. $500 is way too much money to spend on a vacation where you know you won't be able to relax or enjoy yourself. \n\nBut please realize that her \"backpedaling\" may have been her realizing what happened and trying to make things right with you because she really does want you there. \n\nOf course, I'm giving both of you the benefit of the doubt here, and there is a small chance they could just suck as friends, but try communicating with her first before burning any bridges.", "info: Did she know you were coming when the bf made plans?", "[removed]", "NTA.

If you didn't, then yes, they left you out, but it also sounds like they didn't have a clear idea from you of what it was that you wanted to do, besides just be there. The fact that your friend said she was willing to adjust the schedule for you makes me think she genuinely wanted to see you and spend time with you, but just hadn't accounted for you that much while planning.

Not because you cancelled your ticket, because of how you handled this.\n\nOf course you can cancel your ticket. No one is telling you you aren't allowed to or forcing you to go.

That's the nature of sexual relationships. \n\nYou knew you were going on a trip as a third wheel. They should make time for you too, but I'd expect it to be split pretty equally between you and the boyfriend. To be furious because they planned to go on a walk their first night is a massive overreaction. \n\nThe question is, were you spending $500 as a birthday present to her? Or were you spending $500 because you wanted to take the trip? It sounds like you weren't super comfortable with spending that amount on a ticket, and wouldn't have usually done it if it weren't her birthday. But she doesn't know that. She just knows you guys will be in town, and she'll get to see you. I'm sure if she knew how much it was stretching your budget, she'd just say let's see each other in the fall. \n\nSo you got furious and sent a text canceling instead of handling it like an adult, which would be to say \"I am realizing I am not going to get to spend as much time with you as I had pictured, and of course you'll want time with your boyfriend. This ticket was already a bit more than I could afford, so I think I\"m going to just cancel and see you when you get back to school in the fall!\" \n\nShe didn't make you make this plan.

You're being passive aggressive \"not a priority to her to factor any time in.\" She's factoring in time, just not the amount and the schedule you wanted.

And you're probably going to lose that game. \n\nI know you're young, and barely out of high school, but you're not going to keep many friendships if this is how you react when there's a little disconnect in expectations.", "NTA.

Bots seem to love it there.\n\n- comment speaks directly to the OP but is a lower level comment that OP is unlikely to see (as opposed to the original, stolen comment which is top level and will send a notification to OP, so speaking directly to them makes sense)\n\n- comment doesn't logically follow what comes before (because it was plucked at random from further down)\n\n- comment unnecessarily starts with a judgment (because it stole from a top level comment where that was necessary)\n\n- username ends with random letters or a word that is missing the last few letters\n\n- post ends with ellipses for no reason\n\n- account is around a month old and never posted until today. (Update: This is changing.  There are some accounts only 5 days old and some a year old. But having no other comments is the dead giveaway.)\n\n- account made multiple comments in different subreddits/threads within seconds of each other\n\n- post looks like it used a thesaurus and doesn't quite make sense (because it's a rewording bot using a thesaurus! ). Pronouns are often switched and fancy words that don't quite seem to belong are used\n\n- post is nothing but quoted text\n\n- post begins or ends in the middle of a sentence (often ending with a comma instead of a period)\n\n- a bot NEVER has flair (because it never posts top level comments and certainly never has the top top comment) \n\n- The best and last step is to search within the current thread and find the original that was stolen from.  Unless it's a rewording bot or one of the weird ones that copies from a whole other thread or just posts affirmations (eg \"I agree!\" Or \"10/10\" ) you'll find it and know you're right.", "It\u2019s like raaiaaan on your wedding day", "Youre so busy!

They use the karma they gain to run scams. Because they have karma they look (on the surface) like legitimate users and are more likely to fool people. They also gain access to subs that have karma minimums. \n\nThey might try to make some unpopular opinion look popular, or they might try to sell you something. I see this a lot: one bot makes a post about an object. Another asks where to buy it. A third provides a link to buy it. They then either get your money and send you an inferior product or possibly just steal your money.

We were friends since middle school (I think 7th grade for the US). She got married right after highschool and a couple of years later had her first child. While at first everything was fine between us, when her first child was born, every plan revolved around that child. I got it: new parents, still needed to figure out how everything works, difficulty with lack of sleep, problems in the marriage because of it, ... I wasn't someone to demand to do something that didn't really work for her, I was content in just spending some time together.\n\nWell, in the six years after she got married it gradually went from us spending time together as besties to her doing house chores and me basically babysitting for free because she didn't have time to go to town together, even though it was planned weeks in advance and it would have been for an hour or two. And if we could just talk, it was usually her complaining about her life, even though my life at the time wasn't going smoothly either and she knew, but it wasn't as important apperently. Needless to say, our friendship wasn't as strong as it once was at that point.\n\nEventually she finally admitted our friendship wasn't as it used to be and wanted to have a besties night out again. We decided on going to a carnival late in the evening, just the two of us, because we always loved those. Well, the day came, I arrived at her house at 9PM and I saw her hubby and two young daughters (3yo and 3mo) also ready to leave the house. I thought \"they are probably going to bestie's parents house a few streets away which was on the way to the fair\". Yeah, no. The besties night ended up as a date night between her and hubby and me, *again*, as the free babysitter. Every idea I had to do at the fair, *they* did, while I stood at the sidelines with a toddler and a baby, way past their bedtime.

They were clearly okay with adjusting the plans (they probably hadn't realised through the \"lavender haze\" that they were excluding you), but you had already canceled the ticket.\n\nAlso, travelling and exploring on your own is awesome and character-building.  You ruined a great opportunity for yourself.", "NTA", "NTA.

I recently went to visit my bestie and his boyfriend. He took one full day off for us to spend together doing stuff and the next day (Saturday) the three of us did stuff together. I loved spending time with both of them and didn't feel like a third wheel. That's not a good feeling and I don't blame you at all.", "Nta!", "NTA. I very recently went on a trip with my friend and his boyfriend - I was hesitant at first as it was going to be me and my friend originally but he asked if his boyfriend could join us as he was a huge fan as well of the event we were going to attend for a few days during the trip. Of a 5 day trip they only had 1 day where they went off and did their own thing - and asked beforehand if I was OK doing stuff myself for that morning, and 1 day was me and my friend just us as his boyfriend wanted to do a couple museums solo that he knew we weren't all that into. The rest of the time all 3 of us hung out together, went sightseeing and to shows together, ate together etc. It really helped me get to know my friend's boyfriend better and for me to count him as a friend as well rather than just a connection through my friend. Your friend should have taken this as an opportunity for all 3 of you to have a good time together and for the 2 of you to bond if she sees her relationship with him longterm, rather than treating you as not even a third wheel or afterthought but no thought at all.", "NTA.\n\nYou chose wisely. Do NOT let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NAH. I think you did the right thing, as you would be the 3rd wheel the whole time and be spending most of the time with people you do not know. I also understand their point of view as they are actually in a relationship and have not seen each other in a while and won't see each other for a while after. Not that it makes it right, but it does make it understandable.", "NTA, don't ask someone to come visit you and then not spend any time with them. She doesn't sound like a very good friend, honestly. Maybe he would have been better off flying her out to see you guys and then if you got to see her for a couple hours that's fine you didn't have to rearrange your life for a few days to do that.", "NTA. Good call. Never be happy with being a third wheel. Anyone telling you to \"tough it out\" for weeks is a doormat.", "NTA. Why does she even want you to go in the first place? I wouldn't want to go either just to be by myself in a new city with total strangers. And I'm not going just to tough it out.

So you wont be the third wheel.", "I don't think she even deserves a birthday gift from you at this point.", "NTA. Completely agree with your decision - can you go and visit her at a different time to when her boyfriend is visiting?

First, I totally empathize with OP feeling like she was getting the raw end of that deal because she clearly was. Where I think OP went wrong was assuming this was all malicious and then reacting to that assumption as if it they were caught red handed.  \n\n\n>She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, \n\nNot sure what was meant by the friend \"back pedaling\" but this sounds like the friend was willing to be flexible and change things for OP's sake. It sounds plausible that the friend may have actually thought this planned was good and was caught up in the excitement to even realize the perceived problems.  \n\n\n>and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.\n\nOP proceeds to then make accusations that her not getting designated friend time was intentional and calculated. While its possible this was true, its more likely that the friend thought OP would prefer to hang out as a group and didn't see a need for dedicated 1 on 1 time.\n\nNow I'm not saying that OP should have gone on the trip anyway, but since this is OP's best friend, she should have at least been given the benefit of the doubt. Personally, the idea that the friend was just using OP as a means to deliver her boyfriend sounds incredibly farfetched. I think the likely story was that this is a new group of friends traveling and hanging out together for the first time away from school and that there was some misconceptions about how the trip would go.", "This", "Not even a third wheel.   \nMore like a spare wheel left in the trunk", "How is OP being used here?

When they made a plan to go on a walk the first evening to get some time alone? \n\nThat's not being ignored, that's just not being included every single time.", "Going on a walk the night they get there? That's not something to get furious about. I think the expectations were just differing, and the friend offered to change the way things were split up.", "In this post alone she did not screw up just once. She screwed up over and over again untill OP had it and no longer felt comfortable to come. Even then the friend kept screwing up, because instead of acknowledging the situation she created, empathizing remotely and respecting OP in any way, she doubled down and began backpedalling to see if she could still get OP to bend to her wants and needs. Further proving she does not care about OP at all, she cares about herself only.\n\nETA: \n\n>BF and OP made this plan together\n\nNo, bf only suggested they both fly out to go to \"friend\", the friend was aware, that's why OP says things like \"None of us\" (referring a group) instead of \"neither of us\" (referring 2 people).", "This is really useful, thank you!", "I do have context, in the actual post. Context: Best friend invites OP to come stay with her for 1 week, but does not make any time or effort for OP and plans to dump OP for the majority of their stay. This alone tells me the \"friend\" is treating OP like a toy; fun and shiny when in the mood to play with it, cast aside when bored or if something better comes along. \n\nA best friend would not treat OP like she is not even slightly important to her. A best friend would not whine about being asked to make time somewhere in 1 week to hang out with you when you're being invited by them in the first place. So OP can call it whatever she likes for now, but if this friend keeps behaving like this, OP will see fast that she is not in fact, an actual friend\n\nPeople are not quick to drop best friends, they are quick to drop toxic entitled ah's that they thought were friends.", "Well, the friend didn't invite OP.
