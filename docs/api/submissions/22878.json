She has a boyfriend (21M) who goes to school with us, but my bestfriend decided to go home for the summer so its just us. Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. None of us are rich but they absolutely have more money than me, and it stressed me terribly to spend $500 on a ticket anywhere. I still bought it, because she is my friend and she means a lot to me. The two of them had been planning the trip without me and I was excited to see what they'd planned. Once we all got on Facetime, I realized they planned one on one time every single day and I would be left in the city with no friends for hours on end. She didn't plan anything fun for just the two of us to do together. And on the first night, they plan to go on a walk together and leave me in the house with her parents and siblings (who I have never met) because they think the meet up would be anticlimactic if they didn't get alone time. \n\nNeedless to say, I was furious. I know I am just the friend and he is the boyfriend so he gets more time, but at the bare minimum I expected one thing blocked off for us to do. I felt like some sort of glorified travel buddy for her boyfriend and I didn't spend $500 just to do that. After the Facetime I wrote them a text letting them know I didn't think I was comfortable going anymore. I still planned to send my friend's birthday gift to her house, but I did not want to go on the trip any longer. She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.\n\nI've talked to some of my friends about this and they agree, saying I shouldn't go there just to sit in a foreign city by myself. Others have said I was too harsh and should've just toughed it out.

Your friend might not realize this about you, even if you've been friends for a while.

If you didn't, then yes, they left you out, but it also sounds like they didn't have a clear idea from you of what it was that you wanted to do, besides just be there. The fact that your friend said she was willing to adjust the schedule for you makes me think she genuinely wanted to see you and spend time with you, but just hadn't accounted for you that much while planning.

That's the nature of sexual relationships. \n\nYou knew you were going on a trip as a third wheel.

Or were you spending $500 because you wanted to take the trip? It sounds like you weren't super comfortable with spending that amount on a ticket, and wouldn't have usually done it if it weren't her birthday. But she doesn't know that. She just knows you guys will be in town, and she'll get to see you. I'm sure if she knew how much it was stretching your budget, she'd just say let's see each other in the fall. \n\nSo you got furious and sent a text canceling instead of handling it like an adult, which would be to say \"I am realizing I am not going to get to spend as much time with you as I had pictured, and of course you'll want time with your boyfriend. This ticket was already a bit more than I could afford, so I think I\"m going to just cancel and see you when you get back to school in the fall!\" \n\nShe didn't make you make this plan.

Friend was wrong to not include her, but when OP brought it up, friend apologized and offered to change things around. OP could\u2019ve taken friend up on that. \n\nI also have friends that hang out with my wife and I, and we\u2019ve developed those relationships. OP should work with friend and BF to develop that kind of relationship.", "[deleted]", "How can you tell? Lol", "What'd they say?", "Exactly. I don\u2019t think that friend and bf were intentionally malicious, but definitely incredibly thoughtless and pretty selfish. It\u2019s reasonable for OP to assume that since she was invited to go, that she\u2019d be part of the fun too. Why\u2019d they even invite her in the first place?", "When they already have all seasons \ud83d\ude2d", "u/Far-Acanthaceae-6895 is a bot,  though I can't figure out where it stole from.  It's an old account with only 3 comments ever posted, all posted back to back.", "u/EinsTwo is a bot.", "Why are there so many bots and who benefits from them?", "But no one wants to be an afterthought like that. Her friend put all this effort into time with her bf and not a second thought into OP. This is a conversation to have after this trip occurs and when OP isn\u2019t shelling out $500 they can\u2019t actually afford to spend.", "Not me with you on the idiot side at least", "Tips for spotting bots:\n\n- I'm extra suspicious of the comments in the 3rd position on a thread. Bots seem to love it there.\n\n- comment speaks directly to the OP but is a lower level comment that OP is unlikely to see (as opposed to the original, stolen comment which is top level and will send a notification to OP, so speaking directly to them makes sense)\n\n- comment doesn't logically follow what comes before (because it was plucked at random from further down)\n\n- comment unnecessarily starts with a judgment (because it stole from a top level comment where that was necessary)\n\n- username ends with random letters or a word that is missing the last few letters\n\n- post ends with ellipses for no reason\n\n- account is around a month old and never posted until today. (Update: This is changing.  There are some accounts only 5 days old and some a year old. But having no other comments is the dead giveaway.)\n\n- account made multiple comments in different subreddits/threads within seconds of each other\n\n- post looks like it used a thesaurus and doesn't quite make sense (because it's a rewording bot using a thesaurus! ). Pronouns are often switched and fancy words that don't quite seem to belong are used\n\n- post is nothing but quoted text\n\n- post begins or ends in the middle of a sentence (often ending with a comma instead of a period)\n\n- a bot NEVER has flair (because it never posts top level comments and certainly never has the top top comment) \n\n- The best and last step is to search within the current thread and find the original that was stolen from.  Unless it's a rewording bot or one of the weird ones that copies from a whole other thread or just posts affirmations (eg \"I agree!\" Or \"10/10\" ) you'll find it and know you're right.", "It\u2019s like raaiaaan on your wedding day", "Youre so busy! I love seeing botfighters in the wild", "Nope.  And now I have super awesome bot hunters flair to legitimate my bizarre hobby!", "Here's something i wrote previously in response to a similar question:\n\nBots are computer programs that steal comments from real users and repost them higher in the thread as if they are their own. They use the karma they gain to run scams. Because they have karma they look (on the surface) like legitimate users and are more likely to fool people. They also gain access to subs that have karma minimums. \n\nThey might try to make some unpopular opinion look popular, or they might try to sell you something. I see this a lot: one bot makes a post about an object. Another asks where to buy it. A third provides a link to buy it. They then either get your money and send you an inferior product or possibly just steal your money. (And the products they sell are all stolen from the real content creators.)", "[deleted]", "why does she? she\u2019s not OBLIGATED to go. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have more fun staying where she is, then in a different place where she knows nobody (she won\u2019t be hanging out with her friend) and doesn\u2019t care much to be in without her friend", "Everytime I have gone to visit someone, they have planned out what we do. They might ask me questions \"which tour so you want to do?\" Or \"how does this sound\" but they plan it. When I do girl's trips, the agreement is that whoever is local does the bulk of the planning.", "Like a free riiiiide when you already paid \n\nLol idk if I shoulda continued the song but I love it", "I didn\u2019t know this was a thing!! I report bots all the time through their profiles, but didn\u2019t think to call them out in the comments!", "Thanks for that. Appreciate it.", "Good try but I'm not. It's not because I don't agree woth your nonsense that I'm not human \ud83e\udd23", "So if you find out that you don\u2019t care for what they planned, tell them that, and they offer to change plans do you say forget it, I\u2019m just not coming?", "\ud83d\ude02", "Woa he sounds so human!  ;)", "If they told me that they planned for me to spend hours by myself when they were with someone else, I probably would say that yes.", "Except the friend DIDNT PLAN ANYTHING that included OP for the entire week. Like what part aren\u2019t you getting? This isn\u2019t just a case of the friend scheduling a wine tasting too early in the morning, she literally purposefully excluded OP from every single event.\n\nYou seem dead set on defending this which makes me feel like must be just as rude and inconsiderate as OPs \u201cfriend\u201d.", "Why do I feel that whatever I would say you will answer \"IT's a BoT!\". Like... sure! This bot appears years ago, is active for months on multiple subs, comments with good context and made original post but SURE! Totally a bot!\n\nSorry kiddo, but you're too pathetic for me, it's cringe. So bye \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEdit: Did you erased your answer? That's hilarious! For the record, he was trying to report me as a bot.", "I\u2019m just dumbfounded, Reddit has shown me how lucky I am to be surrounded by the friends and family i have. And how bad other people can have it. I will continue to communicate with my friends and family, bring up any problems I may be having, and accept they are human when they realize that I was hurt by their actions and attempt to make it better. Again if that makes me a weirdo or an a-hole then so be it, but I will be a weirdo with good friends that I care about and that care about me.", "My family and friends communicate too. But if someone invited me on a trip and told me they had made lots of plans and then left me out of those plans, I'd be devastated and no I would '5 want to still go. \n\nMy guess is the friend doewn'5 want to tell her parents this is her boyfriend or the parents don't him to boost alone, so they need OP and that makes rh m shitty friends.", "So the rest of us are the unfortunate ones because we don\u2019t have friends and family that purposely exclude us and treat us with horrible disrespect? You think that you\u2019re lucky that you have to regularly tell your friends and family that they\u2019ve hurt your feelings? \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to have so many of these conversations with your family pal."]}
