So please bear with me \n\nI\u2019m married to a man I\u2019ve been with for six years. I\u2019ve recently made friends with \u201cA\u201d last year. A has terrible taste in men and has had multiple boyfriends during the year I\u2019ve known her. I\u2019ve respected all the boyfriends she had and I don\u2019t judge her even though they all were terrible men, Ive hung out with her and the boyfriend of the time and whatnot. \nShe\u2019s recently gone through another bad breakup and she now expects my husband to leave the house or not be home in order for her to come to my house because \u201cshe hates men\u201d but she keeps going back to her ex boyfriend every other day and doesn\u2019t enforce this rule to others \nWhen she comes over my husband gives us space. He\u2019ll say hello and be friendly but stays in our bedroom (completely his choice) and only comes out when she\u2019s there to use the bathroom or eat, he stays out of our drama and talks because he could care less about what we talk about and spends the time to himself doing his own thing. \n\nI\u2019ve had enough of her expecting my husband to leave his home just for her to come over and have told her I\u2019m not longer enabling this behaviour especially because he hasn\u2019t done anything to her, he doesn\u2019t hover or get involved and he\u2019s friendly towards her and she doesn\u2019t expect her other friends or family\u2019s husbands to leave the house.

She brought it up four months ago in conversation but she was frustrated and rambling so I didn\u2019t think much of it. But she actually requested it a few weeks later and I said no. My husband has not seen her during the four months. I\u2019ve seen her once. Only because she rang me up crying and I felt bad and my husband was at work at the time\n\nTo the one person commenting saying \u201cI\u2019m making my husband stay in the room\u201d umm nope. I\u2019ve asked him to stay in the same room, (with her or other friends) but he likes to take the time to have uninterrupted gaming time.", "created_utc": 1667824840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yolo9z/aita_my_friend_expects_my_husband_to_leave_the/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
