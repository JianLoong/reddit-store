I'm WFH, and he lots her job. Because she has three kids, she made a big stink to keep the entire second floor to her and her kids. I got \"stuck\" with the creepy, musky basement because of her.\n\nOnly it turned out to be a dream. I'm very introverted, and nobody wanted to go down to the creepy, unfinished, spider-infested basement. So it worked. I spent every month since trying to finish the basement. I finished the floor with epoxy. Fixed the water heater on my own dime. Got a split-unit for heating/cooling. Exterminated. Then I installed some nice track lighting. Got a mini-fridge and foos ball table. Now it's my own personal clubhouse.\n\nUntil recently, when I noticed someone was stealing my energy drinks and messing with my game consoles. Nobody confessed. So I bought a lock and key for both doors, gave my dad the only spare (it's his house), and locked up on Thursday, so I could go to an office meeting.  That's when we found out it was my nephew, because he left his stuffed toy in there and apparently whined all day until my dad got home and let him in. Now my sister is raising hell about how I shouldn't get so much space to myself since I don't have kids; that I don't pay enough rent to justify it; that nothing in this arrangement is fair and she is demanding that I leave the space open as a family room.  That was not the arrangement though. The basement is my room, and I'm the one who spent all that time and money fixing it. Nobody wanted to be there until I was finished with it.\n\nThings got heated and I called her kid a filthy brat, because he is. He gets mud everywhere. Never washes his hands. And he's broken just about every console she's ever gotten the kids. And now she wants me kicked out of the house.

You had an arrangement. She got the second floor, you got the basement. \n\nThe lock is a great idea, I love it. Don\u2019t engage in the argument, it\u2019s not her house, it\u2019s your dad\u2019s. So, as long as your dad isn\u2019t asking for you to leave, just go grey rock over her complaints. Don\u2019t fight, just ensure you\u2019re good with your dad and ignore her. Maybe consider keeping the door locked when you\u2019re there too, if she\u2019s gonna raise a fuss.\n\nEdit to add: awww! I\u2019ve never gotten an award before! Thank you!", "NTA your sister is a spoiled brat", "NTA. She is effectively demanding that her children be able to take advantage of your work and investment into your larger family home instead of training her kids not to go into your space.", "NTA. She is entitled as hell. Wow. However, the only solution that I can see is moving out, so I would get started on that if I were you.", "NTA.\nHave Dad write up a contract for your living arrangements since sis, brought home 3kids and herself to a whole second floor alone demanding.\nMake sure you claim your WFH office credit on taxes and such. \nMake those brats stay out!", "NTA.    \n\n\nSave and protect us from all these people who think others were put here on this earth to pay for and cater to them.   \n\n\nI'm glad your dad has your back.  Your sister sounds like a pill.", "NTA.  Remind your dad that you made all the improvements on the space, and you were given an unfinished, unheated/cooled, infested space in order to cater to your sister and her children.  That you went completely out of pocket to fix the space up, and only now that it's a space worth being in does your sister and her children want entry.  So why should you have to give up all the hard work and expense you put into that space just because your sister is making demands?", "NTA. Don\u2019t lose your clubhouse lol. You managed to make it the way it is with your own money and time, and she has no right to demand taking away your personal space from you. Your dad also shouldn\u2019t have left her kid in. If you are paying rent, it is YOUR space and only you are the one who allows who can come in and who can\u2019t. Ofc your dad can be an exception in case there is an emergency, but besides that you are paying rent, so that is enough to demand privacy too. Besides, is she willing to pay all the stuff her kids could break in your room? Hell nah, it makes me mad just to think about letting the kids take your bedroom as their game room", "NTA at all. Your sister and her kids are not entitled to your hard work. Shoot her words right back at her: \"It's not fair that you get the entire 2nd floor to yourselves and forced me into the basement until it's convenient for you.\"\n\nI hate parents who think they're allowed to get away with anything just because they have kids. Your sister is a bigger brat than her kids, it seems. Tell her if she doesn't like it, *she* can leave.", "NTA. She's an entitled AH.  Your dad is also, albeit slightly for unlocking and letting the brat in.  He had no other need to be in your room but to steal your food and snoop.  If your sister wants more room to herself then she should have thought about that before she had kids.", "NTA. What a horrible, entitled sister you have. I hope you'll have your own place again soon.", "NTA, you spent time and money to improve your space (which is awesome btw). No one else put down cash or did anything to help, and it's your space. Sounds like your sister is entitled and sadly continuing that with her own kids.", "NTA\n\nFunny how no one wanted to even go down in the creepy, unfinished and infested basement that didn't even have heated water, but your sister made such a fuss that you had to move in down there. And now when you've put your blood, sweat and tears to fix it up, now she's making fuss again and wanting it creepy basement to be communal. I'm sorry but your sister sounds incredibly entitled, and I hope your dad's got your back.", "NTA But it's up to your landlord (dad) and you really need to have some one on one conversations with him about what exactly your rent entails. If you don't already have one get a document, too, to protect yourself.\n\nThen her opinion doesn't matter.", "You are NTA for preserving your space, ESPECIALLY if you're paying rent (seems implied, I could be wrong).\n\nHowever, keep your anger with your sister and anyone else who thought it was fine for a kid to raid your fridge and use your things. I think the personal insult about the kid was a bit much. Doesn't change my final vote, tho.", "NTA - Your dad seems ok with it and you used your own money and hard work to make it nice. Don\u2019t let your sister and her bratty kids ruin it. Like you said nobody else wanted the room.", "NTA. But your sister sure is. Plus, she is an entitled brat. She got the entire second floor for her and her kids. And now she wants more?? What does your dad have to say? I would hope that he sticks up for you. Because you improved what was otherwise an unused portion of the house & raised the property value. What has she done? Oh wait...Nothing. Because she isn't working.", "NTA. The basement--which nobody else wanted--was decided to be yours. That was the agreement, and you seemed fine with it by agreeing your sister's family would have the upstairs. Your father could have asked for rent from both of you--which is between you and him, not any combination of people that involves your sister--and it appears that he did not. Even so, your improvements to the basement (if your father wanted to get the house appraised) may have likely increased the value of the home--which sounds like a decent substitute for rent that was never requested in the first place. And I emphasize that these were YOUR improvements to the basement -- your sister could have assisted to keep some part of the basement a mutual family space, and it sounds like she failed to do so. I do not see any reason for her to now stake claim on any part of the basement.", "NTA. Holy shit, your sister is a real piece of work. Don't give up your space and keep your room locked. I hope your dad has your back", "You should remind her that she got an ENTIRE FLOOR to herself and her kids.\n\n#NTA", "NTA. Get a lease agreement from your dad as treat this like a business relationship. Your apartment, your money, your choice.", "NTA. What does your dad have to say about this?", "NTA, get that lock and work on moving out when you can. Keep the grungy kid away from the consoles too. You know if he breaks it the sister wouldn't compensate you.", "NTA\n\nGood solution with the lock. When she claims you're not paying enough rent, ask her how much she's spent on improving her area. While you're spending money to add value to the house, her brats are destroying your dad's house. And since she's got 4 people to your 1, she should be paying a lot more. \n\nYour basement sounds great! I'd love to come play foosball!", "NTA - It's your dad's house; your sister's opinion doesn't matter. Smart move with the lock.", "NTA\n\n I would lock it when I was home as well when I'm out.", "If it was me I would also invest in a lock for the fridge and possibly a locking cabinet for important items like game consoles. I don\u2019t believe people should be allowed in without your permission but I don\u2019t know how much dad is going to follow that train of thought.", "INFO:  Did you call your nephew a filthy brat in his presence? \n \n\n\nIf not, NTA\n\nYou need to keep that lock on the doors.   Your sister is an entitle brat.    She seems like a lazy mother, as well.   \n\nIf so, that's an ah move.    \nAn adult calling a child names because his mother hasn't taught him how to behave in a normal home, i.e. washing hands, cleaning up after themselves, etc.,  is despicable.   It's not his fault his mother hasn't done her job.  \n\nI would, in the future, be sure to get every agreement with her in writing so she can't come at you with a he said-she said complaint.", "ESH\n\nYour sister and her kids have zero right to ever go in your basement.

That's up to your dad.", "NTA for locking the basement. It's your space as decided before. It shouldn't change now 'cause you made it a better place.\n\nBut you're an AH if you called the kid filthy brat directly to the kid.

Something is fuelling her entitlement, and it feels like it's him.\n\n Also, you may want to point out that you spent your own money improving a space your dad will also get benefit from when you leave. Big difference when you leave something better than when you got there, so her demanding you pay more rent is laughable.", "NTA but don\u2019t argue with her.\nIt\u2019s your dad\u2019s house and what he is happy with is the only thing that matters", "You already have an agreement with your landlord aka dad. He has a spare key for emergencies and you pay rent. That's the end of the discussion. NTA but let your dad know that if he let's anyone into your rented space that you will be moving out asap. As for your sister tell her to shut her pie hole about things that do not concern her.", "NTA\n\nYou have made improvements to the home, and are working and contributing, while adding one person to the household bills.  She is not working.  Does she pay any rent?  I suspect her contribution is not commensurate with the strain she adds to the household with four people.\n\nIt should be made clear to her - and your father - that should you leave, you will be taking the split-unit, the fridge, the lighting, and the game systems.  The \"family room\" shall cease to be, because it never was a family room.  It was YOUR room.\n\nAll that being said, I think your attitude towards the kids sounds a bit off, and I doubt it helps tensions in the house.  And likely does not please your father.

If she wants more space, she can get a job and rent a larger space - not try to justify why you should have space taken away from you in your own home.\n\nThe fact that you pay rent gives you even more standing here - that agreement is between you and your parents, and she has no business trying to make herself a third landlord.\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t pay rent though, her having children doesn\u2019t mean she can demand a second family room in the home.\n\nYou are an asshole for going after her kid like that - his hygiene had nothing to do with this dispute. Nor does it make him a brat - it makes him a kid. Same for breaking stuff - kids are careless. And since you mentioned a stuffed animal, he sounds young.\n\nLocking your space was the correct decision - calling him a filthy brat was not.
