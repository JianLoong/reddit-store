I'm WFH, and he lots her job. Because she has three kids, she made a big stink to keep the entire second floor to her and her kids. I got \"stuck\" with the creepy, musky basement because of her.\n\nOnly it turned out to be a dream. I'm very introverted, and nobody wanted to go down to the creepy, unfinished, spider-infested basement. So it worked. I spent every month since trying to finish the basement. I finished the floor with epoxy. Fixed the water heater on my own dime. Got a split-unit for heating/cooling. Exterminated. Then I installed some nice track lighting. Got a mini-fridge and foos ball table. Now it's my own personal clubhouse.\n\nUntil recently, when I noticed someone was stealing my energy drinks and messing with my game consoles. Nobody confessed. So I bought a lock and key for both doors, gave my dad the only spare (it's his house), and locked up on Thursday, so I could go to an office meeting.  That's when we found out it was my nephew, because he left his stuffed toy in there and apparently whined all day until my dad got home and let him in. Now my sister is raising hell about how I shouldn't get so much space to myself since I don't have kids; that I don't pay enough rent to justify it; that nothing in this arrangement is fair and she is demanding that I leave the space open as a family room.  That was not the arrangement though. The basement is my room, and I'm the one who spent all that time and money fixing it. Nobody wanted to be there until I was finished with it.\n\nThings got heated and I called her kid a filthy brat, because he is. He gets mud everywhere. Never washes his hands. And he's broken just about every console she's ever gotten the kids. And now she wants me kicked out of the house. AITAH?\n\nQuick Update: So after we all cooled down, I did talk to my father. He said he has zero interest in letting the kids down there. When my sister tried to protest, he pointed out to her that the place is still not safe for kids. There are still rat traps. Exposed wood. He pointed out that she, herself, kept screaming about there being \"mold\" (there isn't). So he doesn't want ANY kids down there. And unless she's willing to pay for an inspector to check (she's not), she has no say. So that shut her up really quick.  \n\nThen she got into it with me for the \"filthy brat\" comment, and I was about to apologize because I was heated. It was messed up.  Only dad hopped in at that moment, and chose to have a serious conversation with her about the youngest not washing his hands. He apparently ruined several leftovers in the fridge last week, and \"slimed the butter\" (I don't know. I don't WANT TO KNOW), which my dad did want to bring up anyway. Because the kid has a problem, and won't bathe. But I stepped out at that point because it sounded like he was mad.  Very few things make my dad mad, than having to throw away perfectly good food. It's one of his triggers. So. Everything is shaping my way.

That you went completely out of pocket to fix the space up, and only now that it's a space worth being in does your sister and her children want entry.  So why should you have to give up all the hard work and expense you put into that space just because your sister is making demands?", "NTA. Don\u2019t lose your clubhouse lol. You managed to make it the way it is with your own money and time, and she has no right to demand taking away your personal space from you. Your dad also shouldn\u2019t have left her kid in. If you are paying rent, it is YOUR space and only you are the one who allows who can come in and who can\u2019t. Ofc your dad can be an exception in case there is an emergency, but besides that you are paying rent, so that is enough to demand privacy too.

The basement--which nobody else wanted--was decided to be yours. That was the agreement, and you seemed fine with it by agreeing your sister's family would have the upstairs. Your father could have asked for rent from both of you--which is between you and him, not any combination of people that involves your sister--and it appears that he did not. Even so, your improvements to the basement (if your father wanted to get the house appraised) may have likely increased the value of the home--which sounds like a decent substitute for rent that was never requested in the first place. And I emphasize that these were YOUR improvements to the basement -- your sister could have assisted to keep some part of the basement a mutual family space, and it sounds like she failed to do so.

Granted OP did not mention them because they are not relevant to the story, but the sensory thing with smearing seems something to check out.", "I would honestly show her Articles about Energy drinks and what damage it can do to the body. Not to sail your self off on that ship but for a child that's really bad and can cause heart issues down The road. \nI had known a girl in High school who now has a heart condition do to her love of Jolt Energy back in the day. \nWhere is the dad in this situation? No offense and I know not apart of the post but it really does not sounds like your sister is even trying to be a parent right now.", "Omg, I would really try to ask him because that is very concerning. Even if he did not drink it all, if he has them, don't let him give it to his friends either because if something happens to that child, it will all come back to him and where he got them from (stole from you). Yes! If you google it, there are lots of news articles saying that young adults have passed away from drinking multiple energy drinks at a time. I even found an article where a 6 yo died from drinking one and a 14 yo with a heart condition died from drinking 2. Your sister has some terrible priorities on what she should be worried about more: what is he consuming and his health or him being upset without a toy for a few hours.....", "Nothin wrong with going back home to live with the parents, but it was mad audacious of her to say you aren\u2019t contributing enough when you literally added value to the house itself.", "Thank goodness she agrees there, he needs to get some therapy and age appropriate hygiene scolding or else he's going to end up like one of those men who don't wipe or even wash their butts.", "I don't think calling the kid names is a good look, honestly.  I don't know about the kids' ages, but if they are younger than teens, that can be really damaging. \n\nHowever, I firmly believe that you are NTA for locking your sister and kids out of the basement.  That is your space in the house and you have worked hard to make it comfortable for you.  Sister is just trying to take advantage of your efforts to create an inviting living area and not set boundaries with her kid.  I'm glad you have a lock and your dad is firmly on your side.\n\nAs a fellow introvert, I applaud you!", "Who wants to play on a perfect table that's no fun.  Besides u use that to advantage", "I used to have a way of serving by spinning it with huge sidespin that caused it to go to midfield then go screaming right into their goal.  Illegal yes.  But funny to watch their reaction to the ball flying into their goal", "I'd probably be beaten by anyone now", "You could be right, or I could be right. I just don't like the idea of diagnosing a kid from such minimal information to go off of, and I've read stories of parents insisting their kid is on the spectrum despite no professional diagnosis (as in everyone they took the kid to said, \"No, your kid is neurotypical\") to excuse their kids' behavior so they don't have to take the blame. I would especially hate for the sister to use that as further excuse for why she doesn't have to do her job as a parent. Either way, the sister is still dropping the ball regardless. She needs to get off her ass and do some parenting.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I'm not implying we are capable of diagnosing from our Reddit armchairs. That's the point of what I'm saying. No one here should jump to conclusions about what this kid may or may not have.", "I don't think she gets how expensive it is. Like. Material went through the roof after COVID. She doesn't do home repairs and has rented her whole life.", "........ew. \n\nI don't think he needs therapy. I think his mom just needs to stop excusing his behavior with \"boys will be boys\". It's weird. She never lets her girls act this way. They wash up. They study. They're never let off the hook. They're not angels. But they have manners.", "Oh good point! Homefield advantage.", "Nobody is going to diagnose the kid other than the doctor but they have to bring him in for a checkup the first place.", "Nah. She has no idea. Not just the money for materials but the labor you put in as well.", "Jfc she's lucky someone  doesn't call Child Services on her. That's Literally neglect and down right sad. I have 2 boys and they bathe regularly and brush twice a day.", "Fair, young enough yet to just need a stronger hand than deconstructing years of toxic masculinity, which is what it'll turn into if he's not corrected now. She's doing wrong by her boy for sure, and her girls by holding them to a higher standard and letting them see what they should let boys get away with in their future. Sounds like she's the one that needs some therapy or she'll damage the kids , while not strictly a boy mom she seems to want to lean that way.", "Is your nephew possibly neurodivergent? I know when I was a young girl, there was a period of time where I kind of went through a gross phase because I legitimately didn't think of these things - I'm both mildly autistic and have ADHD. Nothing severe, mind you, more like forgetting to comb my hair and stuff because for whatever reason I just totally forgot about it, or forgetting to brush my teeth. I didn't *intend* to be messy or anything, it's just like I'd completely forget about it. Like that bit from The Simpsons where you see the ghostly image of Homer's brain flying out of his head. A lot of neurodivergent people have major issues with executive dysfunction, and it's a struggle to cope with it. On the upside, you absolutely *can* be neurodivergent and learn better strategies to remember to do these things and get there and be a functional adult. It can be tough, and medication certainly helps, but it absolutely can be worked with.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re dads the best though, your sister however is an entitled (I don\u2019t even want to say the word because I\u2019ll get banned).

I honestly feel bad for everyone in that house that has to deal with her and her kids (I don\u2019t even want to imagine what your dad meant by slime). \n\nYour arrangement is with your dad so long as he\u2019s good, you\u2019re good. Her opinion means nothing, also stop giving her a reaction when she\u2019s looking for it. People like that just try to bait you because they want to argue they love the sound of their own voice. Next time she says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s not fair you have x\u201d just say \u201cwell I do\u201d or \u201ci don\u2019t care\u201d and when she calls you names just say \u201cIf you say so\u201d in a monotone voice.

Agree woth many ppl here, she had no say in this anyway, plus claimed the whole second floor for herself. And kids must learn tp respect other ppl stuff amd boundaries. NTA, obviously", "NTA for locking the room  \nbut YTA for calling a literal child a \"filthy brat\" for behaving like a child, mind you if he cries for stuffed toy, I would assume he's like 5 or something.
