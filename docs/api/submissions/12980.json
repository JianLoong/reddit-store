So my friends and I face timed her and basically told her about our idea and asked if she was down with it. She almost busted a tit over this and went on to ask us if we were saying this to call her fat.\n\nI said no, and that we were asking because we can\u2019t deal with her constant having to stop. An basically how I didn\u2019t get why she was so offended when we were just trying to help. She called us awful people, and started saying how she couldn\u2019t control it because of her weight and we just needed to deal with it.\n\nI went on to say she was being selfish and, asked how was it fair to us we waste all of our time because she makes bad food choices. An said it was either she used the scooter or she could stay home. She went on to cuss me out and hung up. All my friends think I was being nicer than they would\u2019ve been and they\u2019re completely on my side.

But besides the resting time, the problem is her constant complaints all day long. No one wants to spend the day with a complainer.

Maybe not in the exact phrasing you used, but sometimes you gotta be told when you're wrong. \n\nHowever, isolation is going to kill her, so you've got to keep getting her out of the house no matter what.

They are incredibly slow, difficult to manuver, run out of charge with no warning, and are just miserable pieces of cheap and poorly maintained equipment. \n\nIf she was willing to try one, y'all will probably find it actually slows the group down and makes you all crankier and more frustrated.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and arthritis in both knees, so I walk with a cane most days and occasionally have to use a public scooter.  \n\nAnd, I will avoid using a scooter at all costs if I can possibly help it, even if it raises my pain levels. I only use them when I'm having so much trouble walking I'm a fall risk. They are universally so slow and so frustrating and broken.  \n\nWhen I'm using one, I can't keep up with my partner who is used to walking slow with me at my cane pace. The cart is slower than that. \n\nThey turn awfully even in big stores with wide isles, and I have never gone to the grocery without hitting shelving or someone else's cart by accident.\n\nThey legally have to have a certain number for the store, and they take that minimum seriously. They are set intentionally slow and with a poor battery so kids and teenagers can't race them, they almost always only keep two so if they're in use or being charged you're SOL. There are a couple manufacturers that do almost all the retail carts, and they are all awful.\n\nI have rented a medical grade cart for vacations once or twice from a medical supplies company, and they're fantastic. They're the same several thousand dollar kind an individual whose insurance will pay for a cart can end up with.  Personal and paid rental carts are generally quick and nimble.  Public retail carts are anything but.  \n\nI don't at all think you were wrong for making the suggestion.  But I don't want you to get your hopes up that it will actually help if she agrees.\n\nIt's probably worth dropping because of how ineffective it will be even if she said yes.  If you push it, she tries it, and it's a worse experience for everyone, that will cause even more bad and hurt feelings and frustration", "NTA it was a fair compromise so she could remain part of your group.", "NTA - her weight is causing problems for you/your friends.\n\nYour friend group wanted to exclude her entirely and you tried to find a solution that included her.  She rejected that solution.", "I don't know her situation so you probably could have done without the food comment; not all fat people are that way because of what they eat. Many, but not all.\n\nNTA. But I don't understand why she can't rest and wait for you outside a few shops she cares less about. I'm sure there are some stores that don't have a shred of cloth in her size. She could easily rest outside those while you all continue to shop. But youve catered to her whims so long where you just sucked it up and waited around for her; something I don't always do, even for family. Not sure there was much you could do after acceptance of the situation became the norm.", "INFO: Is she really a close friend? If this is one reliable way that she can get some exercise because being with a group takes her mind off of how difficult it is, you're cutting her off from something very important. And if you're going to the mall at least once a week, how much actual purchasing of merchandise do you and your other friends need to accomplish? \n\nThink a little more about the purpose of these trips to the mall. If they really are about shopping efficiently, then maybe just do that independently and figure out another way for the friend group to gather and go for a walk in a way that can accommodate your friend and help her maintain her mobility.", "NAH. You're trying to fix a problem. But it might be good for her to walk instead of being on a scooter. That is between her and her doctor. Also, needing a mobility aid is very difficult for some people to face, especially if they're young. Again, something she should address with her doctor.", "NTA for making the suggestion or telling her it\u2019s the only option for these shopping trips, but you ARE TA for the meanness of your response. She may be making bad food choices, but there may also be some disordered eating or other health issues in her way that require medical help.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s reasonable that when you are shopping with a specific goal in mind it may be difficult to stop often. Maybe a non mobility scooter solution would be to make specific plans with her that just involve walking with the understanding that you all will be taking lots of breaks; it gives you time to hang out, it makes sure she\u2019s getting out of her house, and the time it takes doesn\u2019t matter because the only goal is to stroll.", "I use a scooter following a coma. Yes, it\u2019s embarrassing at first, but the freedom it has given me to wander - around shops or parks - is fantastic. Instead of berating her, tell her how much you enjoy her company & don\u2019t want to leave her out. Maybe agree on where you\u2019ll all go - her favourite clothes/makeup shop - & let her get the benefits over the embarrassment. The more she goes out, the more likely she is to walk too & that can only help her.", "NTA\n\nI kind of used to be this friend without the weight portion - if my friends and I went to events like Comic Con, I would have to take a lot breaks and sit down somewhere because my feet would be hurting so much. It would be the same with shopping. I used to tell my friends to keep doing what they were doing and I'd catch up because I felt so bad that I was making them wait. Some of them would wait with me regardless, which I really appreciated, but I would still feel bad.\n\nThen I developed a chronic illness at age 25 in my feet and my doctors have stated that my feet hurting back then was a sign of the illness starting to develop. It made me feel so much better that I had a legitimate reason for having to take my breaks.", "ESH.  She\u2019s not acknowledging the reality of the situation, but it sounds like you were unnecessarily mean in your response to her. \n\nOne other solution could be that when she needs to sit, you all decide what store you\u2019re going to next and then have her meet you there when she\u2019s ready.", "Don't enable bad behavior, doesn't matter who it is.

You\u2019ve outlined yours well. And she was wrong to lash out at your suggestion. \n\nBut from hers - maybe that extra exercise is helpful. The social aspect maybe motivating for her to move more than she would otherwise. \n\nIt\u2019s not on you to accommodate that. But if you want to shop quickly - do it alone. When you go as a group it\u2019s a social activity so letting her get in some extra steps while enjoying time with her friends. \n\nIf the goal is shop quickly until it\u2019s done then just don\u2019t invite her. I don\u2019t think you would be the AH if that\u2019s the goal, you gave her an option for how she could join you and you could shop as you please. \n\nBut personally when I shop with others, the shopping is the activity but the goal is more spending time with friends and enjoying each others company.", "ESH as somebody who has a heart condition that forces them to sit down all the time your friend group sounds like shitty people but she's the asshole because she didn't even consider it and she knows that her condition effects other people", "NTA", "Fat consequence is real", "ESH. You definitely should've handled it differently and with more compassion. She needs to get her life together (in more ways than one--that level of obesity by your teens is rarely simply an issue of too much food and not enough exercise), and your being unsupportive is counter-productive. Apologize to her, and try to help her with her health issues.\n\nA lot of people are deeply in denial about their poor health and the bad choices they make. Do a one-on-one activity with her that doesn't seem like exercise. There are a lot of exercises she can do seated so she can work her way up to walking more and better. You just have to figure out a way to get her interested.\n\nYou can put some music on and dance a bit--any movement is better than none. Then you can say \"next song is yours.\" Encourage her by complimenting her moves. Trade off each song so she doesn't feel overwhelmed. If it's just you and her, she will be able to become less embarrassed by it over time. You're not judging her, you're having fun listening to music. If she gets tired after only a few songs, then just sit for a while and listen to the music.\n\nBut make sure that you get in some kind of activity with her when it's just the two of you; maybe another time you have to clean the bathroom or something, and you can tell her \"If we do it together it'll get done quicker, then we can watch a movie.\" And of course, have better-for-you snacks during the movie. There are simple swaps you can do that don't make you feel deprived; look online for ideas. The point is, you'll be helping her rather than judging her.", "ESH you were a little too harsh with the words but it's true. She's wasting everyone's time and dragging the day because she's unable to walk around doing basic errands and refuses to use anything that would allow her to complete the tasks in a decent time.  \n  \nI would have just stopped inviting her to places where time is a factor. If she asked why she was getting less invites I would have just bluntly said we didn't have time to wait around for her when she needed breaks.", "YTA. \nI get it, you're frustrated. But how you went about it is mean. \n\nYou should have been more sensitive about the weight problem. Obesity is an actual disease and who knows why she is struggling with the weight. You were very inconsiderate in how you approached it, breaking this down to \"her bad food choices\" (when you don't have the full picture) and implying she is a burden to the friend group. By facetiming her as a group, putting her in the spotlight and embarrassing her. \n\nAlso, it's unhelpful. \nBecause going to the mall with you IS a form of exercise for her, you don't seem to realize. It's good to walk around with you. It's sth she does that keeps her active. That she enjoys. \nDon't take that away from her. A scooter is exactly what she doesn't need. \n\nIf you need sth in a hurry, go alone. If you are going as a group, to enjoy time together, then obviously the group should adjust to the \"slowest\" person. It's like that with any group activity. \n\nIs she your friend? Because a friend deserves to be included and approached with kindness and consideration.", "YTA. Not for the scooter idea, but for commenting on how she makes bad food choices.

The mall has never been a worry (I have never had problems keeping up there despite now being a bit over 300 lbs).

I think if you'd handled the conversation with her better, and in a less accusatory way, than you would not be TA, but the fact is you did basically tell her she was inconveniencing you and then criticised her eating habits, which is a terrible way to handle an obese person. I also think if you'd suggested it to her while she was out of breath in the mall, she'd probably have reacted a lot better than you facetiming her.\n\nOn the other hand, she is also TA because she is basically forcing everyone to proceed at her level. If this was a disability which she couldn't help, there'd be no question that you'd have to accommodate her without complaint, but the reality is that she wakes up every day and makes the choice to eat too much food and do too little exercise, then expects the world to dance to her tune. You came up with a perfectly adequate solution to keep her included (which you admittedly could have put to her in a better way) but she refused to see things from your perspective.\n\nEdit: Oh and by the way, shambling around a mall with sit-down breaks is NOT exercise that will burn sufficient calories to reduce weight, so she wouldn't have been deprived  of any meaningful exercise by using a mobility scooter. You need to do sustained aerobic exercise for at least 12 minutes before your body uses up its glucose reserves and begins to burn fat as a fuel source.", "YTA for how you approached it with a complete lack of empathy and for saying you won\u2019t invite her anymore. If she is your friend, have a little compassion about the subject. She probably feels very hurt that her group of friends most likely talk badly about her condition and consider her a burden. As a teen, those thoughts are common and feelings roam wild. Please be kind, tell her you enjoy her company and WANT her to come, but you want HER to be more comfortable so that\u2019s why you made the suggestion. Leave the ball in her court.

You could've approached the topic nicer. You may meant well by proposing the scooter but I guess she finds it humiliating to use one.

If you're, let her come along and just take it easy. As shocked as I am that kids are even going to a mall these days, I can tell you that in the way back when malls really were a thing, just being there, sitting around and talking, and watching things was the bigger part of the experience than shopping.\n\nETA- if you haven't seen it and want to see what I mean about malls, check out \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\"", "Why do you need to shop and go to the mall all the time?", "I was going to say N T A until the end where you said it was her fault.

I know my realities right now. As much as I want to go out with friends, I know I wouldn't survive say, a day at the zoo or something where there'd be a lot of walking.

Would you would not invite a friend who required periodic stops due to some breathing disorder because of those frequent stops? Would you ask them to use a mobility assisting device?", "I\u2019m not going to pass judgement on this because it\u2019s a difficult situation - you and your friend are both embroiled in a really complex mess of social stigma, broad-based fatphobia, insecurities, etc. I do think it\u2019s important for you to recognize that as a (presumably) straight-sized person (I.e. size 12 or less), your experience of life is very different from your friend. I also think it\u2019s important to realize that while your friend is absolutely responsible for her health and how she chooses to move forward, it\u2019s not as a simple as \u2018she makes bad food choices\u2019 - that\u2019s undoubtedly part of it, but it\u2019s not the only factor, and making different choices is not as simple as just deciding to eat healthier - disordered eating is a mental issue as well as a physical one.\n\nNone of the above negates that your friend is in denial about the limitations of her body, and as someone else mentioned, insecurities are getting in the way of her using something like a mobility scooter to make her life (and yours) easier. But I think it\u2019s important for you to keep in mind when you talk with her about this that your friend\u2019s situation is not as simple as \u2018eat better\u2019, and generally, the world is much, much less kind to her than it is to you.", "Esh?

BMI only considers age, height, and weight- it takes zero other factors into account.\n\nIf your friend is legitimately overweight and is having breathing problems, your shaming them for it is not helpful. \"You're too fat and out of shape to hang out with us unless you use the scooter\" is a cruel thing to say to someone who you claim is a friend. Just because your friends would have been an even bigger AH about it than you were does not make what you said okay. You do not get to decide whether someone else is offended by your words. She clearly was and told you. You then called her selfish for making bad food choices and doubled down on body shaming her.\n\nWeight is not always easy to control.

Im not as active as others so i also struggle to keep up, but that brings onto my next point about why you're an ah.  As her friend you should be supporting her, understanding why she needs to sit for a bit and not be angry at her. You asked her to come and you're well aware of her physical abilities so you cant pretend like shes ruining your day. If it's such a hassle for you, dont invite her.
