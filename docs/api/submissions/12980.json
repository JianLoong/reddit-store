So my friends and I face timed her and basically told her about our idea and asked if she was down with it. She almost busted a tit over this and went on to ask us if we were saying this to call her fat.\n\nI said no, and that we were asking because we can\u2019t deal with her constant having to stop.

She called us awful people, and started saying how she couldn\u2019t control it because of her weight and we just needed to deal with it.\n\nI went on to say she was being selfish and, asked how was it fair to us we waste all of our time because she makes bad food choices.

They are incredibly slow, difficult to manuver, run out of charge with no warning, and are just miserable pieces of cheap and poorly maintained equipment. \n\nIf she was willing to try one, y'all will probably find it actually slows the group down and makes you all crankier and more frustrated.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and arthritis in both knees, so I walk with a cane most days and occasionally have to use a public scooter.  \n\nAnd, I will avoid using a scooter at all costs if I can possibly help it, even if it raises my pain levels. I only use them when I'm having so much trouble walking I'm a fall risk. They are universally so slow and so frustrating and broken.  \n\nWhen I'm using one, I can't keep up with my partner who is used to walking slow with me at my cane pace. The cart is slower than that. \n\nThey turn awfully even in big stores with wide isles, and I have never gone to the grocery without hitting shelving or someone else's cart by accident.\n\nThey legally have to have a certain number for the store, and they take that minimum seriously. They are set intentionally slow and with a poor battery so kids and teenagers can't race them, they almost always only keep two so if they're in use or being charged you're SOL. There are a couple manufacturers that do almost all the retail carts, and they are all awful.\n\nI have rented a medical grade cart for vacations once or twice from a medical supplies company, and they're fantastic. They're the same several thousand dollar kind an individual whose insurance will pay for a cart can end up with.  Personal and paid rental carts are generally quick and nimble.  Public retail carts are anything but.  \n\nI don't at all think you were wrong for making the suggestion.  But I don't want you to get your hopes up that it will actually help if she agrees.\n\nIt's probably worth dropping because of how ineffective it will be even if she said yes.  If you push it, she tries it, and it's a worse experience for everyone, that will cause even more bad and hurt feelings and frustration", "NTA it was a fair compromise so she could remain part of your group.", "NTA - her weight is causing problems for you/your friends.\n\nYour friend group wanted to exclude her entirely and you tried to find a solution that included her.  She rejected that solution.", "I don't know her situation so you probably could have done without the food comment; not all fat people are that way because of what they eat. Many, but not all.\n\nNTA. But I don't understand why she can't rest and wait for you outside a few shops she cares less about. I'm sure there are some stores that don't have a shred of cloth in her size. She could easily rest outside those while you all continue to shop. But youve catered to her whims so long where you just sucked it up and waited around for her; something I don't always do, even for family. Not sure there was much you could do after acceptance of the situation became the norm.", "INFO: Is she really a close friend? If this is one reliable way that she can get some exercise because being with a group takes her mind off of how difficult it is, you're cutting her off from something very important. And if you're going to the mall at least once a week, how much actual purchasing of merchandise do you and your other friends need to accomplish? \n\nThink a little more about the purpose of these trips to the mall. If they really are about shopping efficiently, then maybe just do that independently and figure out another way for the friend group to gather and go for a walk in a way that can accommodate your friend and help her maintain her mobility.", "NAH. You're trying to fix a problem. But it might be good for her to walk instead of being on a scooter. That is between her and her doctor. Also, needing a mobility aid is very difficult for some people to face, especially if they're young. Again, something she should address with her doctor.", "NTA for making the suggestion or telling her it\u2019s the only option for these shopping trips, but you ARE TA for the meanness of your response. She may be making bad food choices, but there may also be some disordered eating or other health issues in her way that require medical help.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s reasonable that when you are shopping with a specific goal in mind it may be difficult to stop often. Maybe a non mobility scooter solution would be to make specific plans with her that just involve walking with the understanding that you all will be taking lots of breaks; it gives you time to hang out, it makes sure she\u2019s getting out of her house, and the time it takes doesn\u2019t matter because the only goal is to stroll.", "I use a scooter following a coma. Yes, it\u2019s embarrassing at first, but the freedom it has given me to wander - around shops or parks - is fantastic. Instead of berating her, tell her how much you enjoy her company & don\u2019t want to leave her out. Maybe agree on where you\u2019ll all go - her favourite clothes/makeup shop - & let her get the benefits over the embarrassment. The more she goes out, the more likely she is to walk too & that can only help her.", "NTA\n\nI kind of used to be this friend without the weight portion - if my friends and I went to events like Comic Con, I would have to take a lot breaks and sit down somewhere because my feet would be hurting so much. It would be the same with shopping. I used to tell my friends to keep doing what they were doing and I'd catch up because I felt so bad that I was making them wait. Some of them would wait with me regardless, which I really appreciated, but I would still feel bad.\n\nThen I developed a chronic illness at age 25 in my feet and my doctors have stated that my feet hurting back then was a sign of the illness starting to develop. It made me feel so much better that I had a legitimate reason for having to take my breaks.", "ESH.  She\u2019s not acknowledging the reality of the situation, but it sounds like you were unnecessarily mean in your response to her. \n\nOne other solution could be that when she needs to sit, you all decide what store you\u2019re going to next and then have her meet you there when she\u2019s ready.", "Don't enable bad behavior, doesn't matter who it is.

You\u2019ve outlined yours well. And she was wrong to lash out at your suggestion. \n\nBut from hers - maybe that extra exercise is helpful. The social aspect maybe motivating for her to move more than she would otherwise. \n\nIt\u2019s not on you to accommodate that. But if you want to shop quickly - do it alone. When you go as a group it\u2019s a social activity so letting her get in some extra steps while enjoying time with her friends. \n\nIf the goal is shop quickly until it\u2019s done then just don\u2019t invite her. I don\u2019t think you would be the AH if that\u2019s the goal, you gave her an option for how she could join you and you could shop as you please. \n\nBut personally when I shop with others, the shopping is the activity but the goal is more spending time with friends and enjoying each others company.", "ESH as somebody who has a heart condition that forces them to sit down all the time your friend group sounds like shitty people but she's the asshole because she didn't even consider it and she knows that her condition effects other people", "NTA", "Fat consequence is real", "ESH. You definitely should've handled it differently and with more compassion. She needs to get her life together (in more ways than one--that level of obesity by your teens is rarely simply an issue of too much food and not enough exercise), and your being unsupportive is counter-productive. Apologize to her, and try to help her with her health issues.\n\nA lot of people are deeply in denial about their poor health and the bad choices they make. Do a one-on-one activity with her that doesn't seem like exercise. There are a lot of exercises she can do seated so she can work her way up to walking more and better. You just have to figure out a way to get her interested.\n\nYou can put some music on and dance a bit--any movement is better than none. Then you can say \"next song is yours.\" Encourage her by complimenting her moves. Trade off each song so she doesn't feel overwhelmed. If it's just you and her, she will be able to become less embarrassed by it over time. You're not judging her, you're having fun listening to music. If she gets tired after only a few songs, then just sit for a while and listen to the music.\n\nBut make sure that you get in some kind of activity with her when it's just the two of you; maybe another time you have to clean the bathroom or something, and you can tell her \"If we do it together it'll get done quicker, then we can watch a movie.\" And of course, have better-for-you snacks during the movie. There are simple swaps you can do that don't make you feel deprived; look online for ideas. The point is, you'll be helping her rather than judging her.", "ESH you were a little too harsh with the words but it's true. She's wasting everyone's time and dragging the day because she's unable to walk around doing basic errands and refuses to use anything that would allow her to complete the tasks in a decent time.  \n  \nI would have just stopped inviting her to places where time is a factor. If she asked why she was getting less invites I would have just bluntly said we didn't have time to wait around for her when she needed breaks.", "YTA. \nI get it, you're frustrated. But how you went about it is mean. \n\nYou should have been more sensitive about the weight problem. Obesity is an actual disease and who knows why she is struggling with the weight. You were very inconsiderate in how you approached it, breaking this down to \"her bad food choices\" (when you don't have the full picture) and implying she is a burden to the friend group. By facetiming her as a group, putting her in the spotlight and embarrassing her. \n\nAlso, it's unhelpful. \nBecause going to the mall with you IS a form of exercise for her, you don't seem to realize. It's good to walk around with you. It's sth she does that keeps her active. That she enjoys. \nDon't take that away from her. A scooter is exactly what she doesn't need. \n\nIf you need sth in a hurry, go alone. If you are going as a group, to enjoy time together, then obviously the group should adjust to the \"slowest\" person. It's like that with any group activity. \n\nIs she your friend? Because a friend deserves to be included and approached with kindness and consideration.", "YTA. Not for the scooter idea, but for commenting on how she makes bad food choices. That just seems cruel in my book. Something is off in this friendship dynamic if you think it\u2019s ok to say this to her.", "NTA \n\nOk I'm also really heavy. The mall has never been a worry (I have never had problems keeping up there despite now being a bit over 300 lbs). But I have worried about being a burden in other situations (mostly theme parks too big for a few rides and too slow for that initial fast walk to the first ride sometimes)\n\nThat being said I get the impression if you did what all others are saying and just didn't invite her when you didn't want to keep stopping and was in a hurry she would be upset about not being invited. \n\nI don't go to a mall to chill.

I think if you'd handled the conversation with her better, and in a less accusatory way, than you would not be TA, but the fact is you did basically tell her she was inconveniencing you and then criticised her eating habits, which is a terrible way to handle an obese person. I also think if you'd suggested it to her while she was out of breath in the mall, she'd probably have reacted a lot better than you facetiming her.\n\nOn the other hand, she is also TA because she is basically forcing everyone to proceed at her level. If this was a disability which she couldn't help, there'd be no question that you'd have to accommodate her without complaint, but the reality is that she wakes up every day and makes the choice to eat too much food and do too little exercise, then expects the world to dance to her tune. You came up with a perfectly adequate solution to keep her included (which you admittedly could have put to her in a better way) but she refused to see things from your perspective.\n\nEdit: Oh and by the way, shambling around a mall with sit-down breaks is NOT exercise that will burn sufficient calories to reduce weight, so she wouldn't have been deprived  of any meaningful exercise by using a mobility scooter. You need to do sustained aerobic exercise for at least 12 minutes before your body uses up its glucose reserves and begins to burn fat as a fuel source.", "YTA for how you approached it with a complete lack of empathy and for saying you won\u2019t invite her anymore. If she is your friend, have a little compassion about the subject. She probably feels very hurt that her group of friends most likely talk badly about her condition and consider her a burden. As a teen, those thoughts are common and feelings roam wild. Please be kind, tell her you enjoy her company and WANT her to come, but you want HER to be more comfortable so that\u2019s why you made the suggestion. Leave the ball in her court.

You\u2019re aware that some people are naturally heavier than others right? And if you\u2019re teenagers (which I am thoroughly assuming from your tone etc) you don\u2019t always have control over what food is available to you. So saying her weight is \u201cher fault\u201d is mean. She\u2019s very aware of her weight, I assure you.

If you want a real solution, maybe work with her to help her lose weight and be healthier. Walking at the mall can be part of it", "Nta. I'm a big girl, I'm also pregnant.  I know my realities right now. As much as I want to go out with friends, I know I wouldn't survive say, a day at the zoo or something where there'd be a lot of walking. Or that I'd likely be too big for the seats at most concerts. So we do other activities together. Game nights, spa days. Whatever. We still have a good time", "YTA, at her size you should be encouraging walking and when you make plans with her, plan the time it will take. It's ok to say \"I'm going to go into that store while you catch your breath, come on in when you're ready\" \n\nYour unsupportuve, you fat shamed her and you're shitty friends.", ">I went on to say she was being selfish and, asked how was it fair to us we waste all of our time because she makes bad food choices. \n\nThis is what makes YTA. Your friend was also an AH for calling you an awful person.\n\nIt was not unreasonable to ask your friend whether mobility assistance could make your mall trips more enjoyable for everyone and easier on her. \n\nI would ask yourself how you would respond if this friend's issue was not weight but some other form of mobility-limiting disability. Would you would not invite a friend who required periodic stops due to some breathing disorder because of those frequent stops? Would you ask them to use a mobility assisting device?", "I\u2019m not going to pass judgement on this because it\u2019s a difficult situation - you and your friend are both embroiled in a really complex mess of social stigma, broad-based fatphobia, insecurities, etc. I do think it\u2019s important for you to recognize that as a (presumably) straight-sized person (I.e. size 12 or less), your experience of life is very different from your friend. I also think it\u2019s important to realize that while your friend is absolutely responsible for her health and how she chooses to move forward, it\u2019s not as a simple as \u2018she makes bad food choices\u2019 - that\u2019s undoubtedly part of it, but it\u2019s not the only factor, and making different choices is not as simple as just deciding to eat healthier - disordered eating is a mental issue as well as a physical one.\n\nNone of the above negates that your friend is in denial about the limitations of her body, and as someone else mentioned, insecurities are getting in the way of her using something like a mobility scooter to make her life (and yours) easier. But I think it\u2019s important for you to keep in mind when you talk with her about this that your friend\u2019s situation is not as simple as \u2018eat better\u2019, and generally, the world is much, much less kind to her than it is to you.", "Esh? Yta?\n\nShe has a serious health problem that may very well kill her and exercise is one of the best ways she can address it. Instead of trying to help her (and I get she's being a pain in the ass about it) you're more concerned about going shopping. \n\nAnyway it sounds like you've cut her out of your life so your problem is solved.

That's what a real friend would do, assuming you are her friend.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, BMI is largely bullshit. It was developed to be broadly applied to entire populations of people, not specific individuals. A muscular but shorter person will register on the BMI scale as \"overweight or obese\" when in reality they may have less than 10% body fat. BMI only considers age, height, and weight- it takes zero other factors into account.\n\nIf your friend is legitimately overweight and is having breathing problems, your shaming them for it is not helpful. \"You're too fat and out of shape to hang out with us unless you use the scooter\" is a cruel thing to say to someone who you claim is a friend. Just because your friends would have been an even bigger AH about it than you were does not make what you said okay. You do not get to decide whether someone else is offended by your words. She clearly was and told you. You then called her selfish for making bad food choices and doubled down on body shaming her.\n\nWeight is not always easy to control. If it was easy to lose weight, fitness wouldn't be one of the leading industries. Your friend probably does have some bad habits that could be improved over time- but she could also have a medical condition with weight gain as a side effect. You don't know. She might not know.

We'd make an effort to include them in activities, but in my life, nobody is so important that they always call the shots.\n\nSo if the Person of Excessive Mass had a problem with how fast people walked, they were welcome to not participate, with no hard feelings.  Not everything we all do is athletic.  They  were also welcome to devise activities.\n\nAnd you basically just have to stop inviting her shopping.

You went from being supportive to fat shaming really fast, which proved her point. Do you know that it's actually overeating that caused her weight? You didn't say that you just said you knew her weight.\n\nThere are many other reasons why she could be so big that don't involve food. There's also mental health issues at play that could be causing her to turn to food.\n\nUltimatums never get the outcome you want, unless that outcome is for her to no longer be in your friend group.

This was not the way to go about it. So yes she can control it and should try to lose weight, she is an AH if she refuses and doesn't try. But why do you think her walking less is a good option? Do you care about your friend or is she just wasting your shopping time? She is slow and out of breathe and finding it hard to move because she is 350. What she needs is motivation, not her friends to threaten to drop her if she doesn't use a scooter. Offer to go for more walks or hikes, go to just walk around the mall with no other intent.

But if she wants to continue going on mall trips she needs to try and find a way to better acclimate with the groups pace, that could mean going on extra walks in her day to day life or using a mobility scooter. Im not as active as others so i also struggle to keep up, but that brings onto my next point about why you're an ah.  As her friend you should be supporting her, understanding why she needs to sit for a bit and not be angry at her. You asked her to come and you're well aware of her physical abilities so you cant pretend like shes ruining your day. If it's such a hassle for you, dont invite her.

Her for not compromising, you for basically adding to her body problems by making her move even less. IMHO best way would be for her to just sit on her own for breaks and meet you again when she\u2019s ready for it.

My friend\u2019s sister came and she\u2019s heavier than your friend. We did a walking tour where you had to keep up or would be left behind.

Instead you've told her she's a burden when out of everyone, you'd expect friends to understand. \n\nShe sucks a bit for blowing up. But I think she felt cornered and attacked.

Your fat friend should not use them.", "I might be alone on this one, but I kinda think you may be TA at least a little bit - though you may have come off nicer than your friends would have been, that doesn't mean you were nice.\n\nYour friend clearly struggles with the idea of using a visible mobility aid in public and for you to suggest that probably puts her in an uncomfortable position which is why she got defensive. You meant well, and it sounded like a great solution, but understand that she's probably not going to take it that way. My mom will use a scooter sometimes because she's gained weight while dealing with some pretty debilitating illnesses, and it can be hard for her to move. It wasn't easy for her to give in and use the scooter the first time. It was embarrassing for her either way- either she felt like a burden losing her breath and stopping because of her pain, and then either asking everyone to slow down or go on without her or she was embarrassed to have to use a scooter. Your friend probably just feels extra embarrassed to have to confront the way her physical condition is impacting others.\n\nBringing up her food choices is also unkind. Yes, she makes her own choices, but you never know what kinda struggles people have with food. Not all eating disorders involve restricting food. What if your friend had a binge disorder or some other medical condition? Just consider the fact that her food choices didn't really need to be brought up at all.\n\nI think it just makes the most sense to communicate in the moment when she wants to stop that you and your friends will shop around a bit more and then meet back up with her.

Your friend is not going to snap her fingers and increase her health overnight, so be compassionate to her in the moment and try to have a respectful conversation.

I wish with every part of me that society had the attitude of \u201cif you need an aid, use it\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t. It is incredibly hard to start using one. So we struggle. We punish ourselves for not being able to do what other people can do. We feel guilty.

It's the same if you had to keep stopping because someone was wearing heels, you tell them to wear more sensible shoes or just stay home. At one point I stopped walking to so many places because it was painful and I needed to stop a lot. (Arthritis)I knew this was annoying to my boyfriend, so I got a walking stick.

She either needs to let you all continue on while she takes a breather or find a way to keep up, like using the scooter you suggested.

There is also no escaping it is affecting her quality of life and, subsequently, yours as well.

Regardless of the cause, she needs to be under medical supervision to help her reduce her weight.\n\nMoreover, she failed to take into account that you are being a friend to her by offering her options in order to continue to participate with the group. If she refused, there is little more you can do.", "NTA\n\nYour friend overreacted. You weren't being rude or fat shaming her. You and your friends wanted to offer an option so she can both hang out with you and also not have to be so uncomfortable walking so much. I occasionally have mobility issues and have to use a cane to walk. It slows the pace down. I hate making others wait for me. I appreciate that they want to do things with me, so if someone suggests I get a wheelchair or use a mobility scooter, I'd happily do that so I feel less like a burden. By making others wait around for me to catch up, I am being a burden and I'd be acting selfish.

People are afraid to talk to their friends about genuine concerns for their health because they will be accused of fat shaming. Can you be heavier and healthy? Yes. Can you be healthy when you are so morbidly obese that you can't breathe when you walk a short distance? No. I'm in my 60s and on the heavier side.

She is morbidly obese.\n\nThere are people, mostly seniors, who do mall walking as a form of exercise. This is promoted as a fitness activity but mostly it is light mobility with some socializing. The walkers take certain routes through the mall to get the desired distance and don't stop. Your friend might get some benefit from this sort of activity. Taking her shopping isn't beneficial for you or for her.", "NTA and I\u2019m glad there are so many professional nutritionists in this thread but the point isn\u2019t that she\u2019s fat, it\u2019s that she lacks the stamina you need to do this trip. The same could be true if she were older, disabled, etc., and the scooter is a reasonable solution. Another idea is that you could do hub and spoke. She hangs out on a certain bench, y\u2019all shop out and return there. She can join you on spokes when she feels up for it. It\u2019s sort of like modifying a workout to suit you.", "NTA", "NAH. \n\nYou're reacting to a problem and suggesting a solution, and she reacted emotionally to your semi-ambush facetime over it.\nI weight 330lbs, I can walk around a mall just fine without stops for hours.

Maybe that will prompt her into trying it out and she'll discover what I have. That it makes her time more enjoyable.", "You are NTA but just FYI, when you get to that weight, there is often a lot more to it than just making bad food choices. There is so much about obesity that goes beyond that, and it is often hard for people who are not in that position to accept that there are many factors that contribute to it. I'm not surprised that she was hurt and defensive, and of course it would feel like an attack when a group of people are facing timing her to tell her she is an inconvenience.  Could you do with a little education and empathy? Yes. Could you have handled the conversation with a little more sensitivity? Yes. Regardless, you are not obligated to be friends with her.", "NTA. You came up with a reasonable solution to the problem, she rejected it.

I am in the weight class of your friend  ( real medical reason),  I know I am fat, I know I cant do everything as every one else,  I am aware of this.  My friend dont exclude me from things, they ask can you do this and I say yes or nor or yes but... and I give them the  choice to have me wobble along or not,   But I dont complain and I know my limits,  your friend seams to be out of the loop of her reality.  \n\nYou could try to help her by going for water aerobics together.", "NAH. \n\nI hope your friend is able to drop some weight for her own sake. Most people I know who struggle that hard with their weight have serious struggles with addiction or a medical condition. I'm sure she will be happier if she can get her weight to a more manageable level.", "NTA, you gave her an option.  You didnt call her fat but the truth is she is unhealthy and it affect you all.

You offered an accommodation. \n\nThe AH part only comes in with you saying \"waste all our time with your bad food choices\". Obesity is really complex. It is food... but it's not just food. I completely acknowledge that her initial reaction, which was unfair and unreasonable, precipitated your response. You didn't start there. It's just worth examining why you said what you did. \n\nI think it's up to her whether she works on her fitness. It's not easy. No one wants to be unfit. But it's something that no one can change save themselves. I don't know if there's any barriers in her way that make that more difficult. I do wish her the best. \n\nHowever, she does need to work on her attitude, sharpish. There's no excuse for that. She needs to drop the defensiveness and work with reality. She is lucky to have friends who were willing to support her limitations rather than ghost her and if she loses you, that is on her.", "NTA. Honest question, does she not realize that she's beyond fat and morbidly obese? You take some of the largest people like an offensive lineman who I guarantee are at least a foot taller than your friend, and 350 pounds is nearly 40 pounds above average for them.. and they are fat, strong as hell, but still fat.\n\nI personally don't mind shopping, so if I wasn't on a time constraint, it probably wouldn't bother me too much unless it was a stop every 30 seconds. So number of stops depends for me. \n\nIf she doesn't want to do the scooter, let her know where you're headed and she can catch up in her own time.", "NTA if she can't move because she's fat she should at least address her fatness", "NTA. You came up with a realistic solution that made it so she can be included and not physically drained. The only thing that you may be slightly the A H for is saying she's her weight because of food choices. Only because it may be from other reasons, but I have no idea. \n\nAs someone with physical limitations, I will sometimes need breaks and can't walk as much. You know what I do, sit at a bench and let whoever I'm with keep doing their thing. We can meet up later. It's not their issue my body doesn't let me walk as much. No reason to mess up their day because of it.", "I would think NTA for the suggestion, but YTA for the escalation.\n\nHave you ever considered that someone with weight related mobility issues would want to walk more to try to slowly work on improving them, and that doing it in a place like the mall with a friend is both motivating and safe for them?

Is she trying to use the mall visits with social interaction as a workout? It sounds like she's expecting you all to stay together the whole time, yet not communicating if she's trying to push herself or has other issue with the scooters.

Also, gauging by the description, y'all sound young. How old is this group?", "This seems like a tough one.\n\nAs someone who is disabled and for a long time avoided the scooters, I get it.  \n\nBut I also get how you're a little miffed because she is kind of choosing to be disabled. \n\nTry to make her less ashamed of using the scooter if possible.  Offer to use the scooter while she walks as far as she can so she can get a little exercise and help shed those pounds.  Then when she gets out of breath, you switch.  \n\nNo assholes here.", "NTA - I have been that morbidly obese person, and though I could keep up with many people, as I got older, it became extremely painful to walk long distances. I had weight loss surgery and now I can walk for hours with no problems. However, if I even caught the slightest hint that I was slowing down someone else's progress, I would decline the invitation and maybe meet up with them under different circumstances. \n\nI do have empathy for your friend, though. I am sure she is very defensive about her weight, and any suggestion about anything related to it is going to be perceived as an attack. She may be resisting the scooter because she already feels self conscious, and now add the spectacle of the scooter in the mix, and well....it's a conversation fraught with peril. \n\nAnd chances are that you all cannot shop in the same stores. Typically the things she can wear are not sold in the same places you and the rest of your friends want to shop. So she is trudging around looking at clothes potentially not offered in her size, which brings even more angst into the mix.\n\nI suggest when you invite her shopping, shop in her departments and stores. And if you want to shop for yourself, just go on your own.", "NTA.  You actually don't need to deal with it. You were not trying to shame her. You presented her with a solution to the problem that going places with her creates.  You don't enjoy listening to her complaints,  and she wastes your time.
