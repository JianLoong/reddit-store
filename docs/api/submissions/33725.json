I\u2019d highly make a plan to coordinate a visit with her family ASAP.", "I lean soft YTA, because you agreed in advance, and it\u2019s been three years of her going to your family, and it sounds like she\u2019s done a lot to go out of her way to support you and make things work around your schedule already. It sounds like you could\u2019ve made it, as well, but just didn\u2019t due to the inconvenience, so it\u2019s not like you actually have the excuse of working straight through the holiday. Just look at the highways on Christmas Eve, and the morning after Christmas\u2026 plenty of people have to make the commute within a very small window, and they still do it, because it\u2019s a once a year thing, and to many, the most important holiday of the year by a significant margin (I don\u2019t know how your family/partner\u2019s family feels of course)\n\nI say soft YTA because understand why you\u2019d be exhausted, and I get that it\u2019s a huge opportunity for you. Honestly, I probably would\u2019ve made the same choice, but I do still think that in this situation, YTA. Sometimes we just have to accept that prioritizing ourselves is a selfish decision, even if that\u2019s not enough to deter us from doing so.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really the sub though, honestly. She\u2019s definitely NTA for how she feels, and if you continue being unable to prioritize her over your career, then I don\u2019t see how this relationship could possibly work long term. You need to have an honest conversation about where your future paths may intersect or diverge and what your respective lifestyles might mean to one another. Even if you\u2019re NTA now, you will definitely be one if you keep deciding to prioritize your work, without being up front and honest about your intentions to do so. It sounds like she\u2019s really doing a lot to try to support your dream, and just from the guilty tone of your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve done much (at least in your eyes) to reciprocate. If so, then that\u2019s really not fair.", "I am going to say a gentle YTA. Part of this hinges on \"I tried to build a plan around maybe flying into Minneapolis (where her family lives), on the night of the 24th, if we could make the drive back in time or leave immediately after the show on the 23rd\". You present this more as a \"I spitballed this idea, it was never really presented as a done deal\" but I wonder if either your GF heard you talking about this and understood it differently, or if maybe you're trying to talk about it now as tentative plans rather than something you had committed to (even if it was a soft commitment). \n\nThe other part of this: your GF sounds like she's been a gem, and has been supporting you in your endeavors, including: she comes to the shows, brings her families to the shows, and helps at the shows. You've done christmas with your folks the last three years.\n\nRight now, it sounds as if she's made all the sacrifices to support you and help you.\n\nWhat have you done for her in turn?\n\nI really do understand that there are some business opportunities you can't pass up, some things are just too good to let go by, and sometimes you really are too tired to make something work, but, friend, it's been *three years* that you and she have done christmas with your family, and not hers. I genuinely believe you when you say you didn't feel like you could pass these opportunities up - but again, it's been three years. \n\nYou need to put her first, and soon. Right now it sounds like she's put up with playing second fiddle to your professional aspirations. How long do you expect her to hang around being OK with having a SO that puts in all the effort for his work, but not for the relationship/family?\n\nAnd gently - if you do not think you're in a position where you can give equal weight to these things, then maybe that is a conversation you need to have (out loud) with your SO. Put your cards on the table. Will she, and family, always take second place? When can she expect (if ever) to be first? She has a right to know long-term what she's looking at here, too, and make informed decisions based on this.", "NAH. I can understand her being disappointed that you couldn\u2019t make it, but I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s upset at you for working over the Christmas period. Frankly I think she\u2019s being a bit childish (not AH level childish though). You can always spend time with her family another time.", "NAH - just say to them what you said to us.", "NAH - I understand her disappointment but I also understand your exhaustion.  It technically is your fault but you did acknowledge ahead of time there was a chance you wouldn\u2019t make it.  Perhaps offer to make a special trip up there soon with the gifts", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your GF needs to understand that things very much come up and that plans have to be adjusted.  You can always rest a few days and then go to her parents' house and spend some time. You have to take care of yourself as well. So just explain what happened and go visit them soon. I am sure they will understand.", "I am married to a the drummer of the album Born to Metalize,  from Megaforce records, he has opened for various acts and been on numerous CDs and tracs. I knew what I was getting into, when I married. He will never pass up a gig, not letting him play is like not letting him breathe. And sometimes he forgets things. Being married to a musician is like the military. I would never change him. He is a good man and brings me joy. You are NTA. Your girlfriend needs to realize to be with you she may have to be solo sometime. It takes a strong person to be with someone in Entertainment."]}
