Standard procedure when a child dies, I guess. CPS takes me asides and tells me that my sister can't be with her kids temporarily while the initial investigation is under the way, and that she requested her two kids (a teen and a toddler) to be placed with me because I'm the only sibling that has my shit together. \n\nI let them know I have to speak with my husband first. \n\n\\*(More background) We just moved into our forever home about a month before this happened and had a previous move ruined by him inviting his mother and brother to stay with us w/o asking me first, while I was going through a mental health crisis. \\*\n\nI called and talked to him, and said I completely understand if he says no, because this is our house so I can not make this decision on my own, because that would be wrong. He asked what will happen to them if we say no. I told him they will go to a foster or group home. \n\nHe then says he doesn't know why I called because he doesn't have a choice and that I will be mad and he will feel guilty for saying no. I told him thats not true, and that's why I called to discuss this with him. They come to stay with us and a few weeks later their mother, my sister comes to stay too. \n\nHer place was a cesspool when her kid passed and once he found that out, its been absolute chaos. Her kids are noisy and have behavior problems and she really doesn't do anything to correct her youngest kids behaviors. She kinda just lays in bed. I have gotten her to do more and be more present, but I also understand she is depressed from losing a child. \n\nHe's been nothing but hateful to both them and me the whole time they've been here. He refuses to do anything except stay in the basement and play computer games all day. He only talks to our child with any type of decency. I understand his frustration and I didn't expect my sister and her kids to act like this. I told him we can have them leave, but then he goes on about how everyone will call him an asshole ...

Is the investigation concluded? This post doesn't make a lot of sense, because it sounded like you were supposed to keep her separated from her kids until you found out how her child died.\n\nAnd how did her child die? I feel like the reasons matter here. If she's complicit in her child's death I can understand your husband's POV a lot better.", "INFO: Why is your sister staying with you too when CPS said she was not allowed to be living with her children?", "You're not the ass hole, and neither is he to be honest.\n\nYour sister needs help, and I'd ask yourself if you're best qualified to provide that help. What you are doing is commendable and clearly comes from a place of love, but is it actually helping?", "Info - did you discuss your sister coming to stay too - or was that unplanned?  Taking in 2 defenseless kids is one thing, but an adult is a whole other kettle of fish.  Especially one who appears to have issues/difficulties.", "Unfortunately, going ESH for all parties.\n\nTaking in the kids is one thing, but moving the sister in would have been a complete deal-breaker, imo. Its also seriously questionable if she wasn't allowed to be with them due to an investigation.\n\nYour husband is being petty and an AH, but I can also understand his anger at his home being completely flipped upside down due to the consequences of YOUR SISTER'S OWN BULLSHIT.\n\nLastly, your sister needs to seriously get her own shit together without potentially destroying your own marriage. It's serious codependency to jump feet first to try and \"fix\" her mistakes without recognizing the damage that YOU are causing to your own home and stability.\n\nShe and her kids need to go. You said you already went though a similar situation with his own family. Stop trying to fix people who can't and won't fix themselves.", "I am sorry for literally every single person in this situation. Literally every one. Your niblings just lost a sibling and are apparently coming from a drug-addled hellhole, yeah, they\u2019re gonna act out. Your husband took them in under duress, and now your sister is there and doing nothing to control her kids. Jesus Christ, I\u2019m so sorry for everyone. \n\nBut I\u2019m seconding the INFO request: how did your nibling die? Why did CPS separate the children from their mother and why are they allowed contact now?", "I N F O, you asked him if the kids could live there during a temporary investigation. Did you also ask him about your sister living there and the kids continuing to live there after the investigation? That's quite different.\n\nEdit: I'm not getting any more info, so I'll give my thoughts. \n\nIt's a tough situation, and watching the kids for say, a week, while an investigation happens is reasonable. His initial response was not good. I think he felt he should say yes, but I didn't want to. He tried to blame you when he was understandably mad at the situation. He needs to communicate better.\n\nYour sister and her kids living there for a long period of time is not reasonable. My guess is that there were no clear discussions, and it just sort of happened. Again, he's doing a terrible job of communicating and using passive-aggressiveness instead. However, he is probably doing that because he feels trapped. \n\nYou are hurting and perhaps ruining your family over this. It's nice to help your sister but not at such a great cost. Your own family comes first. It's not even clear this is helping your sister. The enabling might actually be hurting her mental health. **You** need to realize this situation isn't working and ask her to leave without trying to make your husband the bad guy. ESH", "Not going to be popular, but ESH.\n\nSounds like you had marital issues before your sister and her kids came to live with you. \n\nYour husband fucked up by letting his family come and stay at your home without talking to you, but he's right on the fact that if he had said no to taking the kids in and then asking your sister to leave, he will be the asshole and you'll end up using this in every argument in the future.\n\nI'm sorry about your sister's loss, but it's no reason to stop being a parent to the kids who are still here. \n\nYou need to ask yourself what you want here. If you don't want to give your marriage a chance, let your sister stay. If you want to work on your marriage, find a way for your sister and her kids to move out while making sure the kids are properly taken care of.", "I mean, I guess NAH. \n\nThis is beyond reddit's paygrade lol.  \n\nHe isn't wrong in any of his assessments.  You essentially asked him a question that there was no real way he could say no to without looking like the biggest jerk in the world.  \n\nThese kids have behavior issues, and instead of enjoying his new home, he is dealing with them and your sister who it seems won't address any of these issues.  It sounds like you even agree that its out of hand. \n\nAnd now, again, you say you can put them out, but he is right, he'll be the villain if you do that. \n\nI feel bad for your sister having a child die.  You are trying to do the right thing.  But he is stuck in a no win situation here.  Its just not a good situation for anyone, and I have a hard time calling anyone an asshole here.  \n\nI'd ask, what do you want him to do here.  You say he doesn't do anything, but what would your preference be?", "YTA. How could you NOT expect them to act like this? They're grieving AND out of their home AND  have always acted like this. But YTA for bringing the sister too when you said it would only be the kids. She needs to go stay with a different relative until she gets her shit together, and you should never have let a neglectful drug user whose home was a cesspool into your home unless you AND your husband were 100% supportive of this.", "There is a lot of information missing here. CPS does not just remove custody of someone's children automatically when one of their other children passes away. The fact that they were separated for two weeks and now she is not allowed to see them unsupervised means that he passed away under suspicious circumstances. In that case you should probably un-involve yourself as quickly as possible or things are about to get really difficult for you and your husband.", "ESH. \n\nThis is a very complicated situation and simplifying it is going to be painful and ugly.  Finding and implementing that solution is entirely on you, no matter how you attempt to shift responsibility to your husband. \n\nYou are in over your (well-meaning) head, your husband\u2019s (openly unwilling and resentful) head, your sister\u2019s (grief-stricken and depressed) head and the heads of all the kids involved, both your own and your sister\u2019s.  \n\nYou made a unilateral decision to bring your sister\u2019s children and then your sister into your home.  Your husband\u2019s consent was at best pro forma.  That he\u2019s resentful is unsurprising. You are responsible for a bad situation that is deteriorating.  This is a very complex problem that you allowed to happen in your home, to your husband and child, and now need to somehow solve.  \n\nIf you do not have a plan in place for your sister and her children to transition to an independent living situation, that needs to be established and set in motion now.", "Need more info: originally it sounded like you would only take care of the kids while the investigation was ongoing. You made the right call there. \n\nHowever, now you say your sister also lives with you. It sounds like there is no concrete plan except for having your sister and nephews more or less permanently with you. This is a completely different situation. \n\nDid your husband know your sister would move in? Is there a planned date for your sister and her kids to move out?", "NTA but if you haven't you really need to talk to their caseworker. I know every situation is different but she (your sister) may not be allowed to be living with them at your place.", "UPDATE: \n\nThey cleared her after two weeks of initial investigation and felt it more beneficial to her kids for her to be with them. But she can not be unsupervised with them.  \nI recently resigned from work, so I am home most the time.  \n1. I was not aware of any of their behavior before they came here\n\n2. This is temporary. CPS has a plan to get them in therapy, and have her get a job and place of their own. They are sending her to parenting classes and trying to get the youngest in daycare\n\n3. I understand this is his house too. If he wasn't in agreement, then they would not be here. \n\n4. This sister is not a drug addict. \n\n5. Her child had medical problems since birth and had recently entered kindergarten after getting a corrective surgery. He passed from pneumonia from RSV. \n\n6. They couldn't return to their apartment. It was inhabitable and I didn't see it until after the police cleared the house and we were allowed to get in to remove clothes and personal belongings. \n\n7. I tried to have a conversation about her possibly putting them in CPS care temporarily while she get helps, but i get stoned walled. \n\n8.

Because I don\u2019t understand why she would have to be separated from her kids. My wife and I had a child pass in our home and the cops came and CPS came. They took our surviving children and interviewed them in another room of the house without us being present. They never said we couldn\u2019t be with our kids. And our kids remained with us even while the investigation was active. We were eventually cleared.  Our departed had a heart problem. \n\nThis was county of Los Angeles. So, it\u2019s surprising that they would force the mom to be away from her kids unless they suspected her. And if they suspected, then she would be in jail.\n\nEdit: no condolences necessary.", "INFO:  In one of the comments you said you quit your job - is he now the sole moneymaker for your family and your sister's family?  Is he now supporting you + your forever home mortgage + your nephews + your sister?  Did you two sit down and discuss and agree that you would quit your job, and what would happen after that?", "NTA:  Why are they still there?  It's wonderful that you are helping your sister and her kids.  I don't think that I could do this long term.  What's the plan?", "NTA for trying to help your family, but is the Department not providing services for these kids? You need to contact your caseworker and ask for help. Your sister needs parenting classes and counseling services at minimum, and the children need counseling too. That's the Department's job, they need to get them signed up ASAP. If the situation doesn't improve, the best thing is going to be to placing the kids elsewhere and telling your sister she needs to go.  You cannot ruin your life to try to improve theirs. That doesn't help anyone.", "NAH, he\u2019s being an asshole but understandably so. I think he should talk to the kids with kindness", "NTA \n\nYou're not just helping your sister, you're helping her children. But she has to get out of your house. Even if she leaves the children there. \n\nIt doesn't matter if her child died.  She has two children who need her.\n\nWhen you're a parent you don't have the right to lay in bed depressed.  You go to a therapist. You take medication. You take long showers where you cry. you get your s*** together you put a smile on your face and you take care of your kids. Because that's what you signed up for. And if she can't do that she needs to give them to someone who can.", "NTA \n\nYou did what any kind and decent person would do. It's also been the Christmas period and it would be unkind to turf them out at probably any point over the last couple of months.\n\nYou and your husband are a team, and I would make a bit of time to explain that to him. You are a strong unit and together you work out what you are going to do. He did not seem to understand this but it's important now.\n\nI would speak to CPS and get a timeline out of them. I would not exactly lie to them, but I would make it clear that you would make the children homeless if you had to (government services will let the current situation continue if you do not threaten this but they will step in if they have to). \n\nI would talk to whoever is dealing with your sister's property and get a timeline out of them too. \n\nI would go through that with your husband and get a plan to bring the current situation to end. I think it's probably becoming clearer that this long-term situation is not something you can put up with and you should not have to since you have already escaped. You don't owe anyone anything more than you have done already.", "YTA\n\nI get that you called and asked him but he's right. I had a question, if he said no would you tell everyone you made the decision together, as a couple, or would you have said he said no. I'm willing to bet the latter, but in that case you aren't really discussing it, you're asking permission which is different and puts the denial on him. Weather you meant to or not you pushed the decision onto him which is why he got mad. If he said no then everybody would be told he said no, again I don't believe you would've made sure everybody understood you agreed with his decision because that's almost never how it works out. After he buckled on the non-choice he gave up, how can he fight the situation? Anything he does is his choice, kicking out the mother of three who just lost a child would be on him. If you decide to remove them he will back you but he won't decide anything. I don't blame him, I wouldn't want to be the villain in this either. \n\nThink of it this way, you asked if he had any objections to you allowing your sisters children to stay there. He said he didn't care and it was up to you. You allowed it, not him. This is currently on you, not him. He doesn't want to get involved, I don't blame him. \n\nI'm not going to say you were trying to push the bad guy decision into him but your writing makes it sound like you didn't want to take the kids in but didn't want to be the one to make the call so you kicked the can to him, again I understand him checking out completely.

This is some serious stuff, not the usual drama we see here. That's because there is no right answer here. You are damned if you help them, damned if you don't. This isn't about being an asshole or not. This was a hard choice with no right answer.\n\nIf you want my 2 cents though, based on my own experiences with toxic family, what younhave said about your history with your family, and what is best for you and your household, your partner, you have to put yourself and your family first. If my brother came to me with some situation like this, I would follow Kratos's advice to his son Atreus and close my heart to it, because I know I'd be dragged down in the shit with him instead of lifting him and his family out of it. And it sounds like you're in that shit now along with your husband and child.

Wrong call or not no one would blame you for trying to help.\n\nI wanted to say there are no assholes but it sounds like your sister is. Whether the state holds her responsible or not, you said she was living in filth. I don't believe for one moment she didn't notice something wrong at any point with the deceased child. And although she is obviously depressed, unfortunately she still has a responsibility to her other two kids regardless. This may sound cruel but she needs to pull herself together enough to be there for them as a mother, not sit around in bed. There are no days off from being a parent even in the most dire circumstances. Now she is putting another burden on you that you shouldn't be dealing with. It's important for her other two kids that they come together and grieve together, and that she let's her kids know they are still a family.

They should have talked through it.\n\nIn any event, allowing her sister to stay was a terrible idea and not putting any conditions on her sister's stay was such an incredibly bad decision and so thoughtless to her husband that I don't even have words for it.\n\nI understand her sister is in mourning, but it doesn't actually seem like her behavior was much better before her son died. OP had to know what she was getting into. OP is N/C for a reason, and her husband warned her as she was walking out the door.\n\nThe reality is, CPS would have reached out to her if she hadn't just shown up and no one else stepped up. Yeah, it is awful the kids would have spent a day or 2 w/ CPS, but OP would have had time to get her ducks in a row and make decisions with her husband  and they would have had a better environment for the kids to walk into. Instead their mom ignores them, OP can't discipline them for whatever reason, and her husband is hostile tword the situation. It isn't  a good situation for the nibblings either.\n\nAnd, OP coming in to save the day for the kids and the sister means the sister doesn't have to make any changes to see her kids whenever she wants. She can ignore them and be a parent 10 minutes a week.\n\nOP didn't do anyone any favors by not thinking this through. I understand and have sympathy for the gut reaction to take in the kids immediately, but it wasn't smart. Taaking in her sister - there just isn't an excuse for that.", "Two kids, that's one thing.\n\nMoving the irresponsible and abusive sister in without warning? I would file for divorce.\n\nNot what the guy signed on for, not wirh the emotional manipulation", "What's the end game here for everyone though? Even when the sister was more stable she sounds like a human disaster add the grief on top of it and where is this going. Is ops husband supposed to be financing her sister and kids untill they're grown? Because it sounds like they are never leaving.", "And this is what her husband is telling her: he doesn't want this kids in his house because they are destroying his home and peace and make his life a living hell but If he says \"no\" he'll be a villain.", "Per a comment by OP she herself has said no in the past to other children in her family when called by CPS to take them.", "Yes, I would. Sucks for them, but they weren't his kids and are not his responsibility. He didn't choose to have them, he didn't choose to take in a dysfunctional adult.  \nAnd for the record, my wife is facing something similar to this, her sister has 2 kids, is abusive to them, and might in the future end up having them taken away. She loves those kids, but she doesn't want the burden of having to raise them either.  \nI would never blame someone for turning down taking care of another person's kids. That takes maturity. Automatically agreeing to something without thinking it through, isn't a smart move. You have to be financially and emotionally ready for the insane amount of work kids are. Suddenly having two more added into your life, just after your partner quit working, like in OP's case, could put OP's family in an even worse position.", "Honey, I would also not stay married to a woman who gets three people into my home that create an unstable environment for my own child while making me the only person that is financially contributing cause she quit her job at the same time.", "I work for a family law attorney who does ad litem work with CPS cases and the cases that we've worked on have always provided supportive services regardless of placement. Maybe they have different rules in different states?", "Do you work in foster care or with CPS? Do you know the rates of removals based on suspicions of negligence? Negligence covers a wide variety or potential issues in the home.", "Same with me. Usually we went with the stance of \u201ceveryone has a very different view of what clean and healthy means\u201d so unless it was a legitimate immediate health risk situation, or the reason for the call, that was not concerning.", "This comment has no bearing on my lived experience. Lived experience in which I referred to in my comment. I agree, starving children calling cps themselves crying bc their father isn't feeding them, for example, is arguably a worse situation for a child to be in. Unfortunately it is my experience, as I stated, that cps takes deplorable living conditions more seriously than many other issues. Specifically like my example mentioned above. It is my ASSUMPTION, based on my PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, that this may be the case in this situation.\n\nHope this clarifies a few things for u", "It is, but not as hard as it will be for those kids. I\u2019ve also worked as a behavioral health tech with severely traumatized children, and caring for those little ones, I felt like I was holding some of my older kids, giving them the love they needed when they were younger. \n\nIf anything it motivates me to keep advocating for them and work harder in doctoral program so that I can better help them as a mental health provider in the future.", "It's unclear whether OP resigned before or after the kids moved in, but yeah, that comment stuck out to me too.\n\nAlso unclear if OP had a second conversation with her husband before allowing her sister to move in too, that part was really glossed over...", "The wife makes his life like living in hell", "I must be missing something I can't find where op says she quit her job", "Yeah. This is something they need to work out yesterday. \n\nOP just doesn't seem like she is taking any action or making any plan or boundries or rules. OP seems to propose that either they live like this until her sister magically changes or OP kicks them all out, blames her husband and holds it against him if anything happens.", "Thank you so much for all you do and for caring for these kids.", "> I recently resigned from work, so I am home most the time.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwjxvh/aita_for_having_my_sister_and_her_two_kids_stay/j1v9595/", "If he was smart, he wouldn't have moved his mom and sister in w/o asking his wife when she was having mental health issues. If he was smart he would have apologized to his wife for that and admitted ot was wrong amd worked on communicating.", "Scroll up."]}
