It can\\`t just be her place. It had to be said in front of others.", "I mean you asked a fair question. How were you supposed to know he hates it? Sounds  like her bad taste and controlling nature almost ruined her marriage", "YTA - are you sure you\u2019re friends? You don\u2019t talk about your friend in a positive light and seem to look down on her. Your friend was trying to show you the work she did which she was proud of and all you did was sh*t on it. You knew what you were doing when you asked her husband if he liked it. \n\nI don\u2019t like those \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d signs either but you sound like a sh*t disturber OP", "NTA because fuck beige.", "Do. Not. Apologize. Rachel is a controlling obnoxious person who sounds exhausting to be around. Her poor husband. He needs to get drunk more often if that\u2019s the only way he can express himself honestly. Be glad to be rid of her. NTA", "NTA. Sort of - because you really seemed to enjoy instigating this whole thing. \n\nWhy pretend to be someone's friend when you really don't like them? That's pretty AH-ish too.", "YTA - you were invited to a new home party. Of course she was excited about it. And I don\u2019t believe for one second that you were innocently making chitchat when you asked him what he thought. And the fact you threw out a decor piece when you lived together def is an AH move. If she didn\u2019t consider his opinion and take his wants in to account, then she\u2019s an AH too.", "NTA I know a Rachel\u2026 hard work.", "NTA. That argument was bound to happen, if not then down the road during their reenactment of War of the Roses.", "NTA", "YTA.     \n\n\nOf course it's gotta be your fault, OP.  It couldn't possibly be her fault!", "UO YTA. You knew what you were doing lol don\u2019t lie. I think you purposely incited the fight. They could have had that convo sober if he had the balls to express his thoughts/feelings. I 100% think YTA.\n\nYou obviously don\u2019t like Rachael. Stop being friends with her. It\u2019s ok to let people go once you grow up and realize you don\u2019t mesh well anymore. Instead of going to see her to have a go at her out of \u2026resentment for her style. You couldn\u2019t just let her enjoy her house and decor, huh? Pathetic.", "Oh dear gosh I want to upvote this a hundred times over \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nTo the post; NTA. Rachel sounds controlling AF. Matt probably appreciated being heard.", "I'm simultaneously laughing and clapping. And clapping some more.", "Comment stuck the landing.  Perfect 10.  Still laughing.  Bravo!!", "Or someone can just like green", "They'll be selling that house before we know it", "I also noticed this tone. It\u2019s a bit suspicious\u2026 but considering it was written after her friend blew up at her and I bet OP\u2019s not feeling super warm towards her right now.", "Choked on my wine, much more pleasant I assume.", "And thinking of some pun for whom he still spurns? \n\n\n (Insert more Cake here haha)", "\\*imagines cauldrons, smoke, and tiny demons in tiaras dancing around the fire\\*", "I agree, and I think we both think at the same time she\u2019s not the ahole. \ud83d\ude02 Her friend sounds like she\u2019s miserable to live with though.", "Even more importantly, what could be the second question that OP asks to bury the relationship in the ground?", "But beige is the average colour of the universe! It's liking being in sync with ALL of existence! /s\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic\\_latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte)", "But would one of your friends be like \"oh this clearly doesn't have his style in it\"? That's a little different from giving zero fucks. You don't blurt out \"I hate it!\" when you give zero fucks.", "Yes thank you. I can\u2019t believe people are saying NTA. I\u2019m not sure she even considered this person her friend. The whole post is just dripping in disdain & slams her friend every chance she gets. She wanted to recruit the husband into her dislike so she could feel superior for whatever reason.", "When you are spending hours talking about the home decor and going on and on, its not only reasonable but its the socially appropriate and kind thing to do to ask the other person who lives there well what are your thoughts on all this.  Weve already heard wifes thoughts on it for hours.\n\nEven if essentially knew he hated it, why does that mean she should ask him his thoughts.  Its rude to ask for the other person whose lived there thoughts-- when he hasnt said anything about it basically for hours.", "He is a grown man. If he can\u2019t stand up to his wife and keeps on spending money for things he hates, Rachel is not controlling, he doesn\u2019t have a spine.", "S\u00e4d, beige d\u00e9cor for s\u00e4d, beige people.", "Honestly,  you make sly digs at your \"friend\" one too many times even before the reveal of what you said. So you're an asshole and a bad friend in general, and I have a hard time believing you didn't make the remark with an intent to stir the pot. I may not love all of my friend's personal decorating styles, but I'd also never speak about them the way you speak about your friend. It's very weird.", "Reminds me of Beetlejuice. Even Delia let her husband have one room for himself and she was a \u201cflake\u201d. NTA", "You all suck", "Wow. You know, I have never really been pro breaking up a marriage, but damn Rachel needs to be left to her selfish self. NTA", "Idk. NTA if this was an innocent question, but your general attitude throughout this post towards your \u201cfriend\u201d doesn\u2019t make it seem like you like her very much.", "NTA, I used to live with someone who was like this and it dove me NUTS. Watched a lot of home decorating shows then would redecorate without any input or thought for the occupants.\n\nHonestly your friend is lucky the only done was her sign being taken. There was a hole the size of a foot in one wall at my place.", "If someone asking her husband if he likes the house is decorated is enough to ruin their marriage, then the marriage was already ruined.\n\nThat said, are you sure she's your friend? It doesn't really sound like it.", "NTA. Do I think you asked that question knowing the answer? Yes. Do I think Matt needed an advocate, which you stepped up for, also yes.", "Your friend sounds like my freshman year roommate; it didn't end well.\n\nNTA. She's just upset she's the third wheel in the situation.", "I kind of think YTA - it seems like you wanted to stir the pot.", "WTF is this, a sitcom?", "NTA.\n\nHow did you almost ruined her marriage? You were just asking an honest question on what Matt thinks. \n\nIf she can't accept Matt's honest answer, then maybe they shouldn't be together. But that's not on you.", "Buddy, that\u2019s just how some marriages work. My parents are exactly like this and have been happily married for over 35 years. OP is NTA and Rachel should have asked for Matt\u2019s input but if they\u2019re happy in their marriage then it is what it is.", "You actually  helped Matt,op, his wife needs  therapy +medication  to stop being a dictator.  The marriage  is a partnership. Nta", "I agree but at the same time, if your marriage can be ruined by a question that at least can pass for innocuous, you got bigger problems.", "Oh for sure ... *beige* fucking problems", "Even so, this is still on Rachel.  She made her own bed by being an asshole to her husband.", "Probably, but it\u2019s not like anybody can blame her."]}
