Girl, he put your photo through the ToonMe app or similar AI tool. No real artist is doing original portraits for free.", "INFO \n\nIt feels like we\u2019re really missing a lot of information here. First of all, it\u2019s not okay for your husband to insult you like that. That\u2019s not loving or respectful and if that makes you question your marriage I think that\u2019s understandable. \n\nSecond, how did you get the artist to do a portrait for free if their work is usually in the hundreds of dollars per piece? I work with artists professionally and it\u2019s really uncommon, so I\u2019m curious about the arrangement. Mostly because if it is someone you know who was doing it as a favour I can see what your husband would be upset about you sending nudes to someone you know even if he overreacted and it was purely for professional purposes. \n\nThird, did you ever ask him if he even wanted this gift? It doesn\u2019t sound like a gift he would like based on his response, so I\u2019m curious what made you go that route.", "for free? is your naked body all over the internet right now? cause its hard to believe that this was with no strings attached", "ESH\n\nYou didn\u2019t take into account how sending naked pics to another man would make your husband feel and your husband is an AH for calling you names", "ESH. You're very naive if you really think that was free. Your husband's right on that one. But he shouldn't said a few thinks like he did.", "INFO - Shoe on the other foot...\n\nHow would you feel if your husband gifted you a nude drawing done by a woman he just looked up on the internet and sent a bunch of his nudes to, then told you that he got it all done for free?", "ESH you for thinking just because he's renowned that nothing bad will happen to the digital photos you sent.  Harvey Weinstein was once renowned in Hollywood.  Your husband is the AH for what he called you.  A husband should never call his wife that or anything similar", "I am really confusend here, all im going to say is the title made me chuckle", "Info: was it free or did you have to give him license to sell prints of his work?

A lot of guys aren\u2019t really trying to have some other dude look at their wife naked; I don\u2019t give a shit how renowned he is.

How would you feel if the situation was reversed?\n\nYour husband's reaction was not good.  But he feels that his most intimate relationship has been violated, and he's right. We can try to assign intention and talk about body autonomy and patriarchal responses, but the bottom line is about individual feelings.

TIL that husbands own their wives.", "Yeah I\u2019m having a hard time believing it was actually a free portrait for a number of reasons. Not at all an excuse for OPs husband to react that way. But the idea what a renowned artist would do a portrait for free for a stranger who reached out to them when it normally costs $500 is questionable at best as someone who works with artists and freelance designers. \n\nSo this is either a fake post or there\u2019s some missing info going on.", "I don\u2019t disagree. But I think you should also try to get a sense of whether a person would like a certain gift before giving it to them. Based on OP\u2019s husbands response, he didn\u2019t.

It's about mutual respect. I would be furious if my husband sent nudes to someone else because that's something we have identified as cheating in our relationship. Doing it for art makes it slightly more understanding (to me), but I can see how someone else wouldn't share that opinion. However, OP's husband had absolutely no right to say the cruel and mean things he said either.

I suppose she can't go to the sauna, the nude beach, the massage parlor, or a male OB/GYN either.
