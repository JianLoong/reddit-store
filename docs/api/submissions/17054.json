Here\u2019s an update & conclusion to this situation for anyone interested. \n\nMy bf & I (both equally confused) spoke with his mom. She was shocked by the text\u2019s language, but, as many on my OP guessed, she knew missing context and wasn\u2019t entirely surprised the friend reached out. Here is what she shared:\n\n-Dr friend called her Thurs night, told her I was pregnant (high risk, past ectopic) & asked if she knew. \n\n-On Friday, she called again & the tone was \u201cdefinitely different\u201d. Expressed she was very upset with me, thinks I was irresponsible to have not been on birth control given I had an ectopic rupture in the past, was questioning what kind of person I am, and was concerned (bf) and mom are being severely misled.\n\n-Bf\u2019s mom received \u201cmany\u201d texts & 2 more phone calls on the trip.\n\n-My bf asked if he could have the texts so we could understand exactly what was happening, she said yes.\n\n-One text in particular sums up the gist of the Dr\u2019s perspective & helps clarify why she sent me what she did. \n\n\u201cThis all feels irresponsible, yet calculated. I keep thinking I could get a call that she\u2019s not responsive, drive over there, and find her dead with her dog running around. I know how much that would devastate __ (bf). I was there through his mourning of __ (one of his best friends passed away tragically from drowning a few years ago..). I can\u2019t see him and you go through that pain again and feel I\u2019d be a bad friend to not share this concern about her character, intentions, and health\u201d. \n\nNo point in sharing my views on this here, more importantly how did the conflict conclude? \n\nMy bf said he will never speak to the Dr. He feels like Dr used him to manipulate his mom into mistrusting me. He is furious that - if the Dr cares as much about him as she said in the messages- she did not text or call him once to make sure she had her facts straight (birth control assumption, incorrect) or even to make sure I was \u201cnot dead with my dog running around\u201d (sry w.t.a.f)\n\nHis mom will handle it however she wants to, that is private between her and her best friend, as I think it should be. \n\nPersonally, I think I was the AH for calling the Dr, all context now considered. I regret it, & while I will remain baffled by her series of decisions made between our call & her text, even now knowing where her head was, the best I can do is move on. \n\nThank you everyone who read & offered opinions, & in many cases who shared personal experiences around ectopic pregnancies. And with that, there is no need to respond to this ~~text~~ post. \n\nJust kidding. Except not kidding to anyone who claims an ectopic pregnancy can\u2019t rupture the same day a woman pees on a stick.", "created_utc": 1683897612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fl0ef/update_aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_moms_best/", "score": 122, "replies": ["So she just\u2026 decided you were trying to babytrap (?) or intentionally die (?) on him for ???reasons????\n\nCool cool yeah that\u2019s uhhh some good reasoning and decision making from an emergency room doctor", "Literally what would the calculation here be? That you would get pregnant and then die on purpose just to upset your boyfriend?

What is the state of your relationship with your boyfriends mom roght now? Did she take her friends side and/or believed her therefore no longer trusts/likes/wants you around? I think it's important to know if you can count on her in your and your bfs relationship or if you should keep away from now on", "This woman is not fit to be a doctor. Her reaction to this situation was completely unbefitting of a medical professional and, frankly, unhinged.\n\nThe assumption that you were not on birth control is appalling and moreover, even if you weren\u2019t, the judgement itself is outrageous. To then make a leap in logic that that was some sort of trap for your boyfriend, especially when you had a history of pregnancy being life threatening is so gobsmacking I don\u2019t have the words for it.\n\nShe created all the drama with your boyfriend\u2019s mother. You had nothing to do with it whatsoever. It\u2019s more, even, than her simply creating drama and not wanting to take responsibility for it and blaming you as an out - the content of her messages is insane and she then created multiple non-existent scenarios in her head about you. \n\nEverything about this woman is bizarre leaps from something relatively innocuous to the most extreme end of the spectrum and seeing connections that aren\u2019t even remotely there. It doesn\u2019t even make sense. \n\nThere is something *very* disturbing going on here whether it is drugs/alcohol, severe mental illness or some sort of bizarre desire to have bf\u2019s mum all to herself, or a combination of them. Which I\u2019m saying because she made judgements about you, so fair\u2019s fair. \n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because you called her. It would have happened at some other point regardless. And honestly, if I was in your position I would report her. She\u2019s dangerous.", "Um, why did a doctor disclose private medical information?", "I am still so confused why the Dr did that?\n\nIt seems like MIL wasn\u2019t the reason? So was she being manipulated by someone else?\n\nDid I read the comments correctly that the pregnancy is going fine though? Can I congratulate now?", "Legit confusing. But I reckon you've made the right call to back away from this person.\nTwo things to add though -\n1. I don't think you're the AH atall\n- you put effort in to finding someone to speak to i.e. the urgent care centres \n- you spoke to your bf who advised you to call this dr\n- you have a relationship with this dr \n- you were scared (I'm guessing)\n\nGoing to ED is a horrible experience and I don't see any problem with trying to be safe by seeking advice anywhere you can (sheesh, many ppl turn to reddit for the same reason!) while also trying to avoid the ED. \n\nAs a dr myself I would have had no issue in and of itself receiving a call like this from my bestfriend's kid/partner and would probably be grateful they did. \n\nSo to me, based on the info provided, this sounds like very much a them problem and not at all a you problem. \n\nAnd \n2. Sounds like you're keeping the baby? If so, congratulations! I hope you and your bf have a wonderful pregnancy experience and a healthy wonderful child <3", "> Just kidding.  Except not kidding to anyone who claims an ectopic pregnancy can\u2019t rupture the same day a woman pees on a stick.\n\nI mean, if that *were* the case, that would be *amazing*.  Just pee on a stick every single day to guarantee your safety!", "You are still NTA. This dr has some serious mental health issues she's projected on you, and broke her medical oath by not giving you the medical assistance you required based on thin air. I say, this needs to be followed up, I am pretty sure it qualifies as most unprofessional behaviour on her account. You were contacting her because she was the only medical professional from the area that you knew.", "You're still NTA here. I wouldn't be babysitting her kids anymore though.", "You seem to be a very mature person. Whether the Dr had a traumatic experience causing her behavior (related to your boyfriend\u2018s family\u2018s grief in the past) and was actually worried about you and the family or not, the text she sent to you was wildly inappropriate. I understand that you are cutting her out of your life.\n\nIt is also very good to hear that your boyfriend and his mom are so open and supportive with you. It looks like you found yourself really nice people to be around and I hope you are and remain happy.\n\nI hope you are in good health and that you can leave this uncomfortable thing with the Dr in your past soon. All the best to you!", "I fail to understand how you think you are the AH in this situation. You trusted her to give you the best advice as both a doctor and friend and in turn, she ran her mouth to your MiL. She violated your HIPAA rights. Her excuse is she didn't want to see your partner hurt but in turn, cause him to be hurt anyways. And you didn't and couldn't know her concerns for your partner. \n\nI agree with your BF, she isn't worth having in your life if she's going to treat you like that or fly off the handle without cause.\n\nEdit: after reading thru some of your comments, I get that you are trying to keep the drama and stress to a minimum. But I also gather that your MiL is likely feeding the Dr negative feelings she has of you. \n\nBottom line is this, she violated the law by disclosing your condition without your consent. Her reasoning is bullshit and I don't believe it for a second. She should absolutely have her license taken for it. If she's willing to disclose your private info to a friend of hers, what's to say she has done it to other and what damage that's caused.\n\nI would be extremely cautious before I allow MiL near your child. I would not allow the doctor contact with the child at all.", "Friend is just a narcissist who is panicking cuz her best friend might be more interested in you.\nFor some reason a friend i know who had a narcissistic parent now id say 70% of her friend group are narcissistic, like an ungodly amount cuz narcissists are actually pretty rare at that level. \n\nNarcissists are EXTREMELY good at manipulating ppl especially ppl who are slightly more doormat types like your bfs mom sounds like not wanting to be the \u201cbad\u201d guy.\nShe will most likely let her best friend destroy you and your bf lives before she steps up and does anything about it and unfortunately only she can stop it.\nRead up on narcissists, be careful and know that your bfs mom is compromised.\nIts sad but narcissistic at THAT level are straight up dangerous.\nGood luck.", "NTA and I think you have an obligation to file a HIPAA complaint to protect other patients from this unhinged nightmare person.", "I think you should call the regulatory body for doctors and complain at all the privacy violations.", "Read both posts twice & still confused about the MIL\u2019s bestie\u2019s actions. Very odd behaviour. Plus, in my experience, if you have a pal that\u2019s a medic & you ask them for advice in a situation like yours, they\u2019re always more than happy to provide some casual advice, even if it\u2019s just telling you to contact a medic of your own. I\u2019m curious about what interactions you\u2019ve had with her before all of this as you thought you were friendly, if not actual friends.", "No matter what, you were NTA. You thought you could trust this person and were shown you can't. She shouldn't even be a medical professional if this is how she behaves. I can only imagine how horrible she is to patients if she treated you like this.", "Is there a chance this Dr woman has feelings for her best friend's son? It's very odd that she's hyper fixated on how you're allegedly ruining his life, how she was there for him during a tragedy, how she seems to care more about his emotional state than anything else with this situation, etc.\n\nIs she jealous that he got you pregnant? If so, that's so creepy and wrong on a whole other level.", "What an update! The doctor\u2019s behavior is so strange. I\u2019m sorry she doesn\u2019t like you and it developed into her being so awful during a scary moment for you. I hope your health is ok (and the baby\u2019s) otherwise!", "So she discussed your personal medical situation with other people just like that? WTF?", "What. The. Fuck.\n\nI thought you were NTA based on your OP but this is just insane. You are even more NTA now than before. You shouldn't feel like you are just because she has bullied you into thinking so based on her made up idiotic assumptions.\n\nI thought she was just pissy about being asked medical advice by someone a couple degrees removed from her, which is ridiculous because that happens all the time for medical professionals and family/friends. Clearly that wasn't the issue.\n\nIn the US, what she did is multiple massive HIPPA violations as well as ethical violations. You absolutely need to report this to whatever medical board oversees her. Don't confront her about it either, that would give her a chance to get ahead of it and try to spin it into more bullshit.", "Thanks for the update. \n\nPersonally I would report her for the HIPPA violation, but I also see how that could be more trouble than it\u2019s worth.", "You need to report this \u201cDr\u201d to her ethics board or whichever regulating body you have where you live.", "NTA. The doctor needs to lose his licence", "I still don't understand the emergency that sparked this. You had an ectopic before and are at higher risk of another. But being pregnant again does not mean that you are automatically having an ectopic again. Yes you should follow up to get an ultrasound to verify the location of the pregnancy, but in the absence of pain, discomfort or any other symptom you could have waited to make an obgyn appointment as soon as possible but not emergently. I am not sure what your medical crisis that required calling a doctor that you tangentially know on her personal phone was. You are behaving as if you were actively having a ruptured ectopic rather than someone with higher risk but no actual indication that it is presently happening. The doctors response was unhinged, referral to obgyn minus the dramatic response would suffice. But I am wondering about you and all the other redditors who think just because you're worried about a potential risk, in the absence of any evidence that it is coming to pass, that you should be this distressed. Reiterating that yes dating the pregnancy and getting an ultrasound is needed. That same night, no. I think Google could have gotten you that info. Guys, roast me if I'm wrong this is just...my take.", "The mom told me when I kind of put her on the spot and point blank asked \u201chas she not liked me since I first was introduced to her, and this is a boiling point?\u201d \n\nShe told me she was sorry right now even saying yes, but clearly I am very confused and hurt and am owed some clarity and that yeah she definitely has expressed that she thinks I am not a good fit for __ (her son) in the past a handful of times. \n\nSo she doesn\u2019t like me to begin with, which most people on here and I assumed after reading the tone of that midnight text. I couldn\u2019t tell you the reasons, I\u2019m not perfect and people can choose to not like others for so many different reasons. \n\n(Although I 100% do not understand why someone would trust their kids being babysat by someone they mistrust and hate behind the scenes) \n\nAnyways, I think it comes down to that, and feeling like this was an opportunity to say \u201csee, she is not a good person\u201d. Yeah, she told the mom I could be dead or that I was baby trapping them. I wish I could have talked to the Dr. to conclude this, but I doubt she would have given me straight or coherent answers to why she hates me other than it just being her personal gut feeling and take.", "I have to assume she did not actually believe that (since a simple call to my bf - since she dislikes me and was angry and didn\u2019t want to speak to me directly - could have confirmed I was fine). I also did text her once on Friday to update her that my appointment was positive, and it wasn\u2019t an ectopic pregnancy. \n\nClearly it was just her way of expressing a \u201cwhat-if\u201d extreme worst case scenario, to prove a bigger point on her pre-existing doubts about me to his mom.", "His mom is a single mom / grandma and works all the time to keep things afloat, so she\u2019s super busy after vacation catching up. \n\nI spoke to her last night just us two as a follow up and tbh I tried to not put any pressure on her to make any huge decision on my behalf with her friend right now. She told me they did talk, and her friend was not happy that she was shown our \u201cprivate texts\u201d. That made me so mad inside that I just kinda told my bfs mom that it\u2019s probably best I not be involved further and hope they can figure out what\u2019s the core issue and either move on as friends or not. \n\nThings are definitely awkward right now and tense feeling between me and the bf mom. Which is really the worst part of this outcome and conflict. There was nothing wrong before, and I can tell she feels really terrible and also just plain awkward her best friend is now this big wall in our relationship.", "Exactly my thoughts. This Dr is making assumptions based on nothing, and then making moral judgments on the patient based on those assumptions. She also breached confidentiality, which you could easily cause a lot of problems for her if you brought this to her governing body. \n\nFurthermore, she harassed patients family and patient (her relationship is irrelevant since she never should\u2019ve breached confidentiality). This woman sounds like she lives for drama despite her claim to not appreciate being \u201cdragged into\u201d yours.\n\nBased on your comments, your MIL also sounds like a drama loving ass. Be very aware of the relationship she has with your child and how she may try to influence her son against you. Yuck", "This Dr does sound unhinged...or at the very least suffering from burnout that is affecting her mental health and judgment. For her to jump to so many conclusions seems totally irrational, and to take it upon herself to share OP's private information along with her own unfounded conclusions is (in my opinion) unforgivable.", "It was her best friend and my opinion on that originally was that, while it wasn\u2019t ideal that\u2019s how his mom heard the news, I wasn\u2019t holding it against her (she referred me to an OBGYN who I saw the next day, who is my doctor now). \n\nIn her text to me she made it clear she felt like I put her in an \u201cuntenable\u201d situation where she had to tell her friend. I\u2019m more upset about the hidden motivations she didn\u2019t acknowledge.", "Yeah, this post doesn't elucidate anything, other than the Dr friend is unhinged? \n\nI understand if she were miffed a bit about being constantly treated like a free clinic advice, which does happen I suppose, but for someone reaching out for advice for the first time, after having tried multiple available avenues?", "Someone else shared a link to how to do that -and beyond involving a lawyer on my end - it seems a lot less involved and complicated than I anticipated. \n\nMy boyfriend also would help if I need to do this asap. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound flippant and selfish saying that I don\u2019t want to take on something difficult and time consuming just because I don\u2019t want to add stress right now. \n\nYou all are right that this is very likely enough evidence to indicate she at the least deserves a critical review of her ability to be working ethically. It just feels so personal with her hatred of me and her dynamic with my bf\u2019s family, that I\u2019m questioning how this could possibly come up in other scenarios at work when she\u2019s treating emergency patients who she has no connection to.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s irrelevant.", "Imma be honest, may be completely off base here, but *almost* sounds like Dr has feelings for BF. Perhaps not romantically natured but like, feels motherly or somehow close to him in other ways? If that makes sense?\n\nIt's almost like the MIL who insist on going on the Honeymoon with the newly married couple and will try to parent their kids and talk about how \"no one's good enough for my boy, he needs someone who loves him like his mama\" vibes. \"Oh, OP is pregnant with *my (friend's) son's* kid? She's evil, stealing him, manipulating him and so on...\" \n\nMight just be a guess but it feels like that's what's between the lines for this unhinged response (unless the OP has left out/skewed some vital info).", "I tried to find a response I gave to a similar question on the original post but couldn\u2019t, but we\u2019ve never hung out one on one other than one time I went over there to borrow a cowboy hat his mom was lending me for a themed party and only the friend was home (this sounds oddly specific to remember ha, but I spent a night laying awake in bed scrambling to pinpoint any time I could have had bad interactions with her or hurt her feelings etc, finally caving and waking up my bf and he keeps telling me I did nothing wrong and some people just don\u2019t like another person because of personal reasons or preferences and that his mom is her only friend in the world \u201cfor a reason\u201d*). \n\n*I think that was harsh, people can have only one good friend and be totally normal and nice. Was likely him feeling upset and mad. \n\nWe talked for maybe 10 minutes that day can\u2019t even remember the topics discussed. \n\nOther than that we\u2019ve been around each other a bunch of times, always with others there and casual meals or evenings hanging out at that house. She also asked me (very nicely) if I was busy two separate Saturday\u2019s when she was called in for emergency situations if I could watch her kids that were visiting for the weekend.\n\nTook them to lunch and a park with my dog to play and it was fun.\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.

Every pregnancy is slightly different, and only the person and the doctors who have treated them know enough details to advise in this sense. \n\nMy first pregnancy, which was ectopic, burst very suddenly and very soon after I even knew I was pregnant. My personal sense of urgency last Thursday was a combination of intense anxiety it could happen again that way, and taking the advice of my surgeon and prior OB who both told me that if I were to get pregnant again, the number one priority is that I get in as soon as possible with a doctor to be evaluated.", "Maybe, but she was alone, didn't know anyone and just wanted reassurance.

At every single point in this she has escalated very innocuous things (I am not saying an ectopic pregnancy is innocuous but calling a doctor you know when you are worried about something like that is and asking if they can help is relatively innocuous) into the stratosphere and then kept pursuing the matter to escalate it further. \n\nYou raise a great point about the MIL.

Ok fine judge me on assumptions about birth control. But\u2026 this pregnancy took two to tango.

Blah, I appreciate him standing by me but it\u2019s not an overall good feeling given the circumstances.", "See, if it was feelings for MIL I feel the Dr would be saying things more like \"Oh my goodness are *you* okay? How are you handling *your* son's gf being knocked up?\" (no offense here OP, I'm glad you two are happy!) \"Do you need my shoulder to cry on? Call me *anytime* for help!\" If MIL likes the idea of a grandchild.

Do you want to stay for a cup of coffee?\" Baby would be a way into more time with MIL and gratuity from the family. \n\nHowever, if BF is the focus, OP is stealing his time, attention, availability. His future. Someone more focused on him would drive a wedge between him and others in that case. \n\nAgain, might not be romantic and this is all guesswork. But that's what I'm reading.", "I saw them all, we were all together when she gave them to him. \n\nHer response to the longer message I copy and pasted into this update was: \n\n\u201c__(bf) has been talking with __(me) everyday to check in, and it sounds like her pregnancy is not ectopic and she\u2019s ok and not at risk of what you described\u2026 (cutting out some irrelevant details she gave about her granddaughter and something they were doing together that day)\u2026I know you\u2019re upset and worried about __ (bf), he really does seem fine and excited that everything\u2019s healthy from her appointment. I\u2019ll be home in a few days and we will figure this out together and everything will be okay\u201d \n\nShe was pretty clearly trying to be present with family she rarely sees on her trip, and the short response tone of most of her other responses + her semi annoyed tone recounting to me and my bf how much the Dr reached out maybe indicates she is feeling quite overwhelmed and in a bad position as she explained being the \u201cbad guy\u201d relaying her friend\u2019s messages to us but also the \u201cbad guy\u201d for not doing more to prevent that 12am message being from being sent (that\u2019s what she said, I don\u2019t blame her for her friend sending what she did).", "I agree that patients are at risk from this if incredibly unprofessional doctor.\n\nWhenever you\u2019re feeling calmer, filling a report can be filed conveniently online: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/filing-a-complaint/index.html\n\nGetting a lawyer who is willing to accept payment after you reach a settlement is also worth exploring (most do). Let them handle the stress of bureaucratic things for you.", "Like others have said, this isn't just about you. The fact that she didn't even hesitate strongly suggests this isn't get first time breaching HIPAA. Imagine what could happen if she decided to tell an abusive father that his teen daughter is pregnant. These kinds of things can get people KILLED, and they're why HIPAA exists.", "Whoa there, this is not something that you're reacting to out of the heat of the moment or from hormones. She broke the law and her oath in so many ways and these are not small transgressions.\n\nPlease report her. She is not fit to be a doctor.", "Easier said than done but please do not feel guilty. You did nothing wrong and are not responsible for any of the fallout. \n\nI wish you would consider reporting her though. When someone reports a compliance violation of HIPAA, the doctor doesn't automatically get in trouble or lose their license. There is an investigation. This would be good, because you may not be the only person she's done this to.", "I don\u2019t mean to make light of this situation but given how unbelievably furious my bf is at the moment, I am tearing up laughing at the thought of casually telling him tonight over dinner that there\u2019s a chance the Dr. friend is in love with him.\n\nNot saying your theory is off base at all, tbh I agree there\u2019s got to be something really out there fueling at least part of this for her (beyond simply not liking the person your best friends son is dating)", "LOL I mean. I don't know him or her so this is all soap opera guesswork based on the MASSIVE jump in behavior but. Do update me when you inform him, \"Okay either she's in love with you or might secretly consider you her son that she must protect from a siren seductress (aka OP)\". Just, you know. Leave a little description of his face afterwards or something idk\n\nHey hey but for real congratulations in general! Be the Siren (in a good healthy way lmao)"]}
