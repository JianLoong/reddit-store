People with sensory processing issues may also be more vulnerable to developing food sensitivities, and you can just be more prone to them in general; two people can have the exact same diet and one person will become sensitized to those foods, while the other doesn't. (Could be genetics, gut microbiome, or other reasons-- the general mechanism of sensitivities is understood but not all the factors influencing it.)\n\nThe sensitivity then triggers a mild but chronic immune response (which is what differentiates it from an allergy, which is more immediate and more severe) that causes chronic gut inflammation. It's this *inflammation* that can exacerbate harmful symptoms due to the close connection between the gut and brain. It can also cause gastrointestinal issues like IBS, gut pain with an otherwise unidentifiable source, etc. Inflammation is bad for anyone, but in people with preexisting conditions it tends to manifest as an exacerbation of those conditions. When I did my food sensitivity diet, for example, I saw a reduction in anxiety, even though I did the diet to treat episodes of gut pain. The diet doesn't *cure* anything; it just removes the inflammation which is exacerbating existing things.\n\nThe thing is, you can't make a standardized diet for food sensitivities because they literally develop based on a specific person's body and previous diet. Cutting out all carbs or sugars or some nebulous definition of \"sweets\" is useless, because sensitivities are related to specific compounds in specific foods or food families-- for example, gluten or solanine. Some people DO find help from common trendy diets such as cutting out gluten, because a lot of people eat wheat-heavy diets so gluten is a fairly common food sensitivity. But it's not because gluten is \"bad,\" but simply that they have become *sensitized* to gluten, and it needs to be *moderated* to eliminate that sensitivity and then reintroduced gradually and kept to a moderate level. Seeing a benefit from a gluten-free diet is an *accident* in people who have food sensitivities. And you can't just expect that a gluten-free diet will work because you might increase quantities of other foods that you're likely to be sensitive to, such as oats. (I managed to sensitize myself to oats once by eating them waaaaaay too much after trying to cut back on wheat and not introducing sufficient variety to my diet...)\n\nBut you CAN identify and treat sensitivities. There are now blood tests for identifying specific sensitivities-- I did the MRT blood test and LEAP diet plan, and there are newer (and cheaper) ones on the market too-- and regular bloodwork will show signs associated with elevated levels of inflammation in people with food sensitivities, so there are certainly physical markers of their existence. You can also just do an elimination diet and carefully eliminate and reintroduce foods/food families while checking for symptoms of inflammation, although that can be a miserable process and the blood tests at least eliminate the initial process-of-elimination part so you can focus on just reintroducing foods gradually. Food diaries can help identify foods that you eat the most, which you can try eliminating first and see if that helps, or you can eliminate the most common sensitivity-inducing foods for people with a standard Western diet (stuff like wheat, milk, and eggs, because they're in so many foods). \n\nThe key to treating food sensitivities is to identify the problem foods, eliminate them from the diet to give the body a chance to recover, and then reintroduce them slowly and gradually. They key to *preventing* food sensitivities is to eat a balanced and varied diet from the start. Eliminating entire classes of food like carbs willy-nilly can actually risk making food sensitivities WORSE because it increases reliance on a few reliable substitutes and cuts down on the overall variety of the diet.\n\nA food sensitivity diet CAN help autistic people. because by reducing inflammation, it essentially removes a stressor on the brain. This can lead to lower levels of things like overwhelm and anxiety simply because those things are no longer being exacerbated. It's like removing a source of background noise or a constant physical irritation-- that stress and aggravation is gone and other things are less likely to become triggering or aggravating as a result. But this kind of diet has to be *targeted,* and you have to understand the mechanisms at play, and what's actually being identified and treated. Fad diets are only occasionally accidentally helpful at best, usually useless, and harmful at worst because they can inadvertently cause or exacerbate food sensitivities.", "Just chiming in to clarify that autistic people don't typically throw temper tantrums, they have meltdowns. A temper tantrum is conscious decision to throw a massive hissy fit in the hopes that the person it's directed at will change their mind and do whatever it is you're trying to get them to do; a meltdown is more like a psychotic break, where the person suffering from emotional and/or sensory overload briefly loses control and may act erratically until the trigger is mitigated.\n\nNine years old is certainly old enough to comprehend the concept of \"you don't always get what you want\", so were it not for the autism I'd be happy to call the kid's behavior a tantrum, but if the kid's autistic then it sounds like mom just doesn't want to deal with the meltdown, but also doesn't want to actually parent her autistic child.", "Respectfully, what does this have to do with the original post or the comment you\u2019re replying to?\n\nI\u2019m diagnosed autistic (level 2) and I-and lots of other autistic people-are fully capable of understanding that the dentist *has* to make physical contact with us. What is often difficult is creating healthy coping mechanisms that keep us as regulated as possible throughout the appointment. I imagine that creating these mechanisms are even harder for a higher support needs autistic person, especially if they are nonspeaking, but we are not a monolith. I hate the dentist, it\u2019s a sensory nightmare, but I put off making appointments more due to my struggle with making appointments via phone than because I don\u2019t like to be touched.

Also diet doesn't negate the need for regular dental checkups, good oral hygiene and food moderation can only reduce the severity of dental issues.\n\nI have autism, I was nonverbal until I was roughly 11, I still hate physical touch, I went for dental checkups twice a year for my whole childhood. I never enjoyed it and would often have meltdowns for the rest of the day, but I got through the actual appointments cause even as a kid I could understand the importance of them.\n\nI would actually argue that children with autism show more of an understanding for logical necessities than children without, just in my own experience.", "Not for nothing, but how fucking dare you insinuate I don't \"really\" have Autism because I might not \"know the answer\".

Afaik there are no established benefits to a strictly gluten free diet unless you are intolerant. However, gluten free diets are sometimes advertised as a cure for autism.

Nothing fringe about eliminating diarrh\u0153a, and a gluten free diet is NOT restrictive - most of humanity has eaten that way for a few million years.\n\nThere are real dangers from dietary restriction in autism, but they come from parents going into a death spiral with their kids having ever-narrowing preferences.  You can easily get adequate nutrition from a gf/df diet; when the kid only eats white food (this is common) there's much more trouble ahead.", "So do you think that the mother in the original post should let the Nine year old boy eat whatever he likes?", "It can ruin your kid\u2019s relationship with food even if it\u2019s due to an allergy. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s necessary.", "Non verbal, severe learning difficulties?", "I have no idea what this means", "nope - but making your kid have a restrictive diet and cutting out all sugar isn't healthy and could lead to a horrible relationship with food \nbut if ops mum is doing to diet to try cure her kids autism like some have suggested then i think we have bigger problems here", "All I'm gonna say is, look up Kim Peek sometime.", "I didn't go to school with any of them, so I wouldn't know for sure. But like I said, definitely some with higher needs.", "It means you are absolutely incorrect.", "Being non verbal doesn\u2019t mean you lack the ability to talk, think, or create. \n\nIt just means you don\u2019t speak using your larynx. \n\nLearning & intellectual/developmental disabilities aren\u2019t the same thing as being non-verbal\u2026\n\nMany deaf people are also non-verbal in the traditional sense, but you wouldn\u2019t claim they can\u2019t speak, (as in \u201cconverse,\u201d not \u201cmake noise with mouth\u201d) read, or write. Does that mean they\u2019re learning disabled or have a low IQ? Nope. Just means their communication is non (not) verbal (spoken). \n\nMy uncle had a stroke 16y ago & can\u2019t speak, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s intellectually disabled. \n\nThere is a problem that maaany people have where they conflate \u201cstupidity\u201d / low IQ with other, unrelated diseases & diagnoses. That autistic people are always intellectually disabled, requiring round the clock, lifetime care \u2026 and not that autism is a non-linear spectrum. (Heard someone refer to it as a salad bar once - some people get a lot of onions - which represent a symptom or behavior - while others are just a plate of carrots). \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 you don\u2019t need to speak louder just bc someone\u2019s in a wheelchair. That shit ain\u2019t related. \n\nWell, that and autism is more complex than you seem to realize. And autistic people will always know more about their real life autistic experience than you, a random redditor, knows about autism.", "About what?"]}
