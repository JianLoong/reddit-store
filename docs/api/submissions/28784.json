(Edit: Apparently, studies have shown that a ketogenic diet can also help with autism! See [Pixichixi's comment below this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176d5nm/aita_for_not_hiding_food_from_my_autistic_brother/k4mherg/) for details. I'm not sure whether this is the more relaxed widespread keto diet, though, or the much stricter medical keto diet.)\n\nAutistic and otherwise neurodiverse people can be vulnerable to food sensitivities because we tend to eat the same \"safe\" foods repeatedly for every meal, and eating too much of a single food item too frequently over a long period of time runs the risk of sensitizing the body to that specific ingredient. People with sensory processing issues may also be more vulnerable to developing food sensitivities, and you can just be more prone to them in general; two people can have the exact same diet and one person will become sensitized to those foods, while the other doesn't. (Could be genetics, gut microbiome, or other reasons-- the general mechanism of sensitivities is understood but not all the factors influencing it.)\n\nThe sensitivity then triggers a mild but chronic immune response (which is what differentiates it from an allergy, which is more immediate and more severe) that causes chronic gut inflammation. It's this *inflammation* that can exacerbate harmful symptoms due to the close connection between the gut and brain. It can also cause gastrointestinal issues like IBS, gut pain with an otherwise unidentifiable source, etc. Inflammation is bad for anyone, but in people with preexisting conditions it tends to manifest as an exacerbation of those conditions. When I did my food sensitivity diet, for example, I saw a reduction in anxiety, even though I did the diet to treat episodes of gut pain. The diet doesn't *cure* anything; it just removes the inflammation which is exacerbating existing things.\n\nThe thing is, you can't make a standardized diet for food sensitivities because they literally develop based on a specific person's body and previous diet. Cutting out all carbs or sugars or some nebulous definition of \"sweets\" is useless, because sensitivities are related to specific compounds in specific foods or food families-- for example, gluten or solanine. Some people DO find help from common trendy diets such as cutting out gluten, because a lot of people eat wheat-heavy diets so gluten is a fairly common food sensitivity. But it's not because gluten is \"bad,\" but simply that they have become *sensitized* to gluten, and it needs to be *moderated* to eliminate that sensitivity and then reintroduced gradually and kept to a moderate level. Seeing a benefit from a gluten-free diet is an *accident* in people who have food sensitivities. And you can't just expect that a gluten-free diet will work because you might increase quantities of other foods that you're likely to be sensitive to, such as oats. (I managed to sensitize myself to oats once by eating them waaaaaay too much after trying to cut back on wheat and not introducing sufficient variety to my diet...)\n\nBut you CAN identify and treat sensitivities. There are now blood tests for identifying specific sensitivities-- I did the MRT blood test and LEAP diet plan, and there are newer (and cheaper) ones on the market too-- and regular bloodwork will show signs associated with elevated levels of inflammation in people with food sensitivities, so there are certainly physical markers of their existence. You can also just do an elimination diet and carefully eliminate and reintroduce foods/food families while checking for symptoms of inflammation, although that can be a miserable process and the blood tests at least eliminate the initial process-of-elimination part so you can focus on just reintroducing foods gradually. Food diaries can help identify foods that you eat the most, which you can try eliminating first and see if that helps, or you can eliminate the most common sensitivity-inducing foods for people with a standard Western diet (stuff like wheat, milk, and eggs, because they're in so many foods). \n\nThe key to treating food sensitivities is to identify the problem foods, eliminate them from the diet to give the body a chance to recover, and then reintroduce them slowly and gradually. They key to *preventing* food sensitivities is to eat a balanced and varied diet from the start. Eliminating entire classes of food like carbs willy-nilly can actually risk making food sensitivities WORSE because it increases reliance on a few reliable substitutes and cuts down on the overall variety of the diet.\n\nA food sensitivity diet CAN help autistic people. because by reducing inflammation, it essentially removes a stressor on the brain. This can lead to lower levels of things like overwhelm and anxiety simply because those things are no longer being exacerbated. It's like removing a source of background noise or a constant physical irritation-- that stress and aggravation is gone and other things are less likely to become triggering or aggravating as a result. But this kind of diet has to be *targeted,* and you have to understand the mechanisms at play, and what's actually being identified and treated. Fad diets are only occasionally accidentally helpful at best, usually useless, and harmful at worst because they can inadvertently cause or exacerbate food sensitivities.", "Just chiming in to clarify that autistic people don't typically throw temper tantrums, they have meltdowns. A temper tantrum is conscious decision to throw a massive hissy fit in the hopes that the person it's directed at will change their mind and do whatever it is you're trying to get them to do; a meltdown is more like a psychotic break, where the person suffering from emotional and/or sensory overload briefly loses control and may act erratically until the trigger is mitigated.\n\nNine years old is certainly old enough to comprehend the concept of \"you don't always get what you want\", so were it not for the autism I'd be happy to call the kid's behavior a tantrum, but if the kid's autistic then it sounds like mom just doesn't want to deal with the meltdown, but also doesn't want to actually parent her autistic child.", "[removed]", "Not all people with autism hate physical contact and most understand the concept of having to get through certain things. Also diet doesn't negate the need for regular dental checkups, good oral hygiene and food moderation can only reduce the severity of dental issues.\n\nI have autism, I was nonverbal until I was roughly 11, I still hate physical touch, I went for dental checkups twice a year for my whole childhood. I never enjoyed it and would often have meltdowns for the rest of the day, but I got through the actual appointments cause even as a kid I could understand the importance of them.\n\nI would actually argue that children with autism show more of an understanding for logical necessities than children without, just in my own experience.", "[removed]", "Salient point.", "ironically using the word higher in regards to autism usually refers to higher functioning individuals \nim autistic and have extreme food issues and restricting food has just made me miserable and more likely to get upset/angry", "Not true, I\u2019m on high end on autism and so are others, I struggle a lot with learning and shit, that kid needs better parents and learning!

Afaik there are no established benefits to a strictly gluten free diet unless you are intolerant. However, gluten free diets are sometimes advertised as a cure for autism.
