And have you previously agreed to help with her day-today tasks in place of other care arrangements?", "NTA-Better to be a \u201cbad\u201d daughter in law than a bad parent.", "NTA. Your son is your priority and you did your job as a parent to make sure your son is safe. Even if you didn't have a kid, she shouldn't expect you to drop everything just to help her. She can ask but she shouldn't feel entitled to your help and time.", "While it's rather unlikely that a predator will break into your home and harm your son while you are away for a bit, all your other considerations to not go to your MIL's house are valid: you are disabled, so is your son, and he is young and needs supervision. On top of that, your MIL's 'simple' requests apparently are unpredictable: small tasks that you might gladly perform for her sometimes turn out to take hours of your time.\n\nOn top of that, if you refuse, she ends up badmouthing you and questtiong your morals/ethics, instead of taking no for an answer. That's entitlement.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour husband needs to stand up for you. Also, he might need to speak with his father: he is the one who needs to look for solutions, not you, nor your husband.", "NTA.  WTF is wrong with her?  Even without the disabilities you don't leave a 5 year old alone at home.  Full stop.  That's negligence and can get you into CPS hell.  I'd refuse to even speak with your mil when your husband is at work after this bullshit.", "Let\u2019s take disabled out of the mix. You can\u2019t get me to leave my 6 yo home alone to run across the street for 5 minutes lol. Not happening. Nta", "I'm going with NTA here as well. Maybe a 5-year-old would be fine for 5 minutes alone ... probably ... but most human interactions take longer than that. This one probably would too. You're not being very specific about what needed doing\u2014is that intentional? I do think that adds some context, because maybe it was urgent and maybe not. But either way your priority is your child, so NTA still stands.", "NTA, small children should not be left unattended. A television is not a caretaker.", "NTA. Doubtful it would actually be just five minutes and I don't know a lot of people who would leave their 5 year old alone for an unspecified amount of time, regardless of disability.", "~~INFO - how old is your son?~~ \n\nEDIT: misread the story.

For not leaving your child and enabling her hoarding? \n\nShe needs to learn to accept no for an answer, and perhaps you two should be a little less available to her.", "NTA you are right to prioritize your son\u2019s safety. Your husband needs to set better boundaries with his MIL. It\u2019s not appropriate for her to make unreasonable requests and then name call when her every need is not catered to.

Or *won't* call?\n\n*You* are NTA here, and your MIL is. But it looks to me like she's not the only one. Where's your husband in all this?

Does she actually NEED help or does she want assistance with things that are not urgent...\n\nFound the answer. She has wants... not needs.  These can wait and should not be put on you.

I\u2019ve read your comments as to what your MIL wants, and nothing she is asking for is an emergency or necessary. It\u2019s just stuff she doesn\u2019t want to do herself.

It's illegal in every US state to leave a 5-year-old home alone for any amount of time.", "NTA. And it doesn\u2019t matter what your mother-in-law thinks, so don\u2019t worry about her opinion.

If it will truly take five minutes, MIL can do it herself. If she can't do it herself due to her own disability or another lack of access, she'll have to wait until someone is available to help her.", "NTA - you're not the only person that can help your MIL. There is task rabbit and other options for her. Does she have other friends? Neighbors? If she needs help this often I would find more people in the community and more services to help.\n\nNever feel bad for making a safety choice for your child! <3", "NTA - she is prioritizing her stuff over people which is typical of hoarders. Hoarders regularly see people as extensions of the hoard and by helping her, you\u2019re continuing to enable that position. It\u2019s not that big of a deal to her to leave him as he\u2019s not a person, he\u2019s part of the hoard.\nYou not jumping to help regardless of reasons does not jive with you being part of the hoard which is why she called you a bad DIL.\n\nYou are not a bad DIL, you\u2019re a good parent which should always be the priority (and it was). Her 5 minutes BS was just that, BS. You\u2019d have been there all afternoon. \n\nI think blocking her is the smartest tactic and letting your husband handle her 100% going forward because you can\u2019t treat her as a normal and reasonable person. She\u2019s not. She has a mental illness that is very very hard to treat and something that is not safe for you or your child to be around as she will always prioritize her stuff over your child until she gets help. \n\nAlso never allow her to bring stuff to your home, it is likely highly unsanitary. Anything she brings should go immediately into the garbage.", "NTA, you're mother in law sounds like a narcissistic jerk. Does she not realise that leaving a child of that age home alone is illegal (unless you're not in the US and your country's laws are diffrent). That's extremely unsafe, and you have every right to feel the way you do about leaving your son home alone. Those are all completely valid reasons to not leave your son home alone. Your mother in law is a bone head and the selfish one. What grandmother is ok with trying to force their daughter in law to leave their grandson in that situation. I hope you don't leave your son in her care ever. Sounds like sues very unsafe to leave your son unattended with.", "NTA.
