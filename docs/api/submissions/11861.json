The class started off with pretty standard stuff about footprints and fingerprints and other kinds of less \"human\" parts of a crime, but eventually, we got to talking about bodies.

Though your teacher should know it takes about two minutes to add a content warning line on the syllabus or lesson plan, and that it would save time and headaches from stuff like this. You just ask yourself \u201cwhat is in this that a normal person would not want to hear discussed at the dinner table\u201d and add keywords.

I rarely get disturbed by that type of content so I dont really understand her, but I agree with the part that seeing that type of things should be expected. Instead of doing that much, she could\u2019ve politely asked to teacher to step out of the classroom if that specific topic was too much for her to handle.

She was the one calling others disturbed for not being bothered when they also knew what they were getting into signing up for the course.

I don\u2019t want to be a robotic zombie who isn\u2019t allowed to react to things with human emotion.", "I mean\u2026 for all we know the teacher did. How many of these students actively read or even listen to the teacher read the syllabus? \n\nThe fact that the teacher said people could leave if they were bothered tells me the teacher gave some sort of warning or implication that what they watch may or may not be disturbing or gross.\n\nWhat I do think is at least for elective classes maybe there should be some sort of warning or info in the course description or list that lets students know that the class will deal with heavy topics and graphic content, that the class may not be suitable for everyone as you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re walking into until you\u2019re there.", "I would have thought the class being a FORENSICS class would be enough of a content warning.", "None. The syllabus is the magical document that floats past the students\u2019 field of vision and vanishes into the ether as soon as it is shared. Or it spontaneously self-translates into hieroglyphics. \n\nI hope so, for the teachers sake. Given I once had someone complain we showed disturbingly graphic images in a lecture on serial killers, I know that no amount of common sense ought to apply actually does apply. And not everyone can handle it.", "You\u2019d think so. But no. It\u2019s easier to take the time to type it out because as much as it ought to be obvious, it is not, and you will hear complaints about it if you don\u2019t make it explicitly clear. And even then, you\u2019ll get the odd one, but it\u2019s cleared up faster because you can say \u201cI have a content warning on the lesson plan.\u201d"]}
