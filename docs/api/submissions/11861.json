It was a full documentary that took most of a week to cover in class and damn were we uncomfortable. \n\nIn my freshman English class we were shown One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. At the time it made me kinda uncomfortable, and now that I've had many rounds of ECT years later, I do kinda object to that being shown to young teens who are potentially going to move forward in life with that being their basis of mental health treatment. When it was recommended I get ECT at 18 I was terrified and sobbing my eyes out because all I knew about it was from that movie, I thought my life was ending and I'd never be a person again. I very nearly refused a treatment that today I believe is the reason I'm still alive. \n\nSo I can get how these things can be upsetting. I think both of those movies were shown inappropriately in my case. But your classmate, I assume, signed up for this class where this kind of stuff would obviously be covered, and she is blaming the teacher for her own refusal to walk out when she was uncomfortable despite being told that it was okay. So while I do believe that depending on the person, she really could be feeling some level of trauma...she'd be wrong to go after the teacher, assuming that the teacher really would not have been mad if someone took them up on the offer to step out.

One of them was of several policemen waiting to observe an autopsy preformed by Dr. Quincy.

Want to see how bones are cleaned (go beetles!)?  Want to see parts of autopsies?- Take a forensics course.

We had most adults opt to leave for a minute or even for the rest of the class due to the nature - we had to attempt it but if we felt sick or upset, we were encouraged to leave.  Because this is the first time most people will be exposed to this kind of stuff.  But my teacher at the time explained it like this - if you are seriously considering this field you need to know exactly what you will be dealing with (paralegal) because you will be exposed to all kinds of situations and people.  It is better to know your limits in the safety of school than to causes issues on the job.  Meaning - get some exposure now that way you don't freak in front of someone who desperately needs you to hold it together for them.  \n\nForensic science means something bad has most likely happened and you are dealing with the aftermath - the person, family members, etc.  Being freaked out is okay and normal but she should have excused herself - I have never had a teacher in this field say no you gotta stay here because I can guarantee no one wants to deal with the puke, the hysterics or any of that.\n\nSo, while you may not have been the AH neither was, she (as immature as it sounds - she is just a kid apparently out of her element) - but her parents should have looked at the class description and syllabus.

That\u2019s so unethical and immoral it\u2019s astonishing. \n\nThese people need to stop focusing on themselves, and look outward. It is troubling that she feels no shame at acting immature over a forensics video in a forensics class. If she doesn\u2019t grow up, she\u2019ll generate constant drama, feeling \u201cattacked\u201d and \u201ctriggered\u201d by contrary ideas in college and the workplace, constantly trying to get people kicked out of school or fired. \n\nTrying to take someone\u2019s livelihood away is rather an evil thing to do to someone. \n\nHopefully she will learn a modicum of compassion and personal responsibility. It was her responsibility to learn what a forensics class entailed prior to enrolling, to leave a lecture if she can\u2019t handle it, and to switch the classic she\u2019s incapable of completing it. \n\nBosses and professors are not going to hold her hand and talk her through every crisis she blows up as if she were a toddler.", "I would sympathize with her if it wasn\u2019t for going after the teacher. I would not have put two and two together in high school that forensics was bugs breaking down dead bodies, I would be thinking finger prints / DNA analysis? You guys are very young, it\u2019s not the stupidest mistake in the world. Total dick move about the teacher though NTA", "NTA\n\nYour classmate wants the class to be deemed too much, rather than admit she can't handle it.  She doesn't want to accept the \"failure\".\n\nThat's proven by the fact that she was told she could leave/drop the class at anytime. But noooo, if she can't handle the subject matter then those that can are problematic.", "You literally can\u2019t learn about this stuff without a bit of hard to swallow content. Like what??? NTA", "That girl when forensics class includes forensics :0 \n\nAnyways NTA", "NTA. She's being a drama queen. And a snowflake. That's what the course is about. Maybe she should have read the description before taking it. The course can't revolve around her sensitivities. She just shouldn't take forensics if she's disturbed by\u2026forensics.", "Nah content sometimes needs to be disclosed depending on what it is. Actual psychologist here, you can\u2019t control when that part of your brain (a trigger) is activated! You can control your reaction but if this is the first time it\u2019s happened to her she probably had no idea what to do with it. But you can\u2019t expect actual information from Reddit!", "This is a toughie.  I'm waffling between NAH and ETA.    \n\n\nI agree with your classmate that this is pretty advanced level material, and it probably doesn't have a role in a high school class.  I assume the biology lab doesn't include human dissection for the same reason.  \n\n\nOTOH, I agree with you, that it is pretty ridiculous to take a class about crime, go to pieces over the class material, AND insist that she couldn't leave because the teacher would \"get mad.\"  She was really playing the Poor Little Me card, which is assholic.  I guess it depends on her next move, whether STA.  If she and Mommy decide that No One should see it because it was upsetting to Her (i.e. they try to get the class shut down), then that goes into the STA category.    \n\n\nAs for you:  It IS distressing to see REAL dead people, not the sanitized fake blood manikin dead of media fiction, and you could have been less judgy and more kind when this freaked out your friend.  But you were on the spot, dealing with strong emotions (which is ALSO distressing),  so I'm going with NTA for now.  \n\n\nThe teacher, though... and the admin that approved this curriculum... Hmmm.  There is a reason that certain topics are generally taught in college, not high school, and it has to do with brain development, emotional lability, and other developmental stuff.  I think ultimately we'd all like to get away from this Pro-Massacre mentality, and the way to do that is probably NOT to harden kids to the reality of death and decay.  Not before they have a sound appreciation for their own mortality, at least.  But regardless of the morality of teaching this subject at all, there should have been some real measures in place for kids who discovered it was too much for them to handle--stop the movie, compassionate invitation to leave the room, etc.  I'm going with HTA for the teacher.", "I would have laughed at her, too. It\u2019s a natural human reaction when someone is being that ridicule. NTA. She\u2019s kind of acting like one, though.", "Nta", "NTA she clearly shouldn\u2019t be in that class if it\u2019s going to traumatize her. She\u2019s not a victim here. Nobody is forcing her to be there. The teacher said if it was too much she could leave. Rather than accepting that it\u2019s not for her she thinks nobody should learn this stuff? Has she ever watched true crime shows? It\u2019s never BJ\u2019s and unicorns. It\u2019s ugly truth.\nEdit if she was calling people in the class names, she deserved what you said.", "Oh, good grief!
