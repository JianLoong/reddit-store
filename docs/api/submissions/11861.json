I did my best to cover up all the pictures and only read the text but I was so sick when I\u2018d finished reading it.

It was a full documentary that took most of a week to cover in class and damn were we uncomfortable. \n\nIn my freshman English class we were shown One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. At the time it made me kinda uncomfortable, and now that I've had many rounds of ECT years later, I do kinda object to that being shown to young teens who are potentially going to move forward in life with that being their basis of mental health treatment. When it was recommended I get ECT at 18 I was terrified and sobbing my eyes out because all I knew about it was from that movie, I thought my life was ending and I'd never be a person again. I very nearly refused a treatment that today I believe is the reason I'm still alive. \n\nSo I can get how these things can be upsetting. I think both of those movies were shown inappropriately in my case. But your classmate, I assume, signed up for this class where this kind of stuff would obviously be covered, and she is blaming the teacher for her own refusal to walk out when she was uncomfortable despite being told that it was okay. So while I do believe that depending on the person, she really could be feeling some level of trauma...she'd be wrong to go after the teacher, assuming that the teacher really would not have been mad if someone took them up on the offer to step out.

One of them was of several policemen waiting to observe an autopsy preformed by Dr. Quincy.

Want to see how bones are cleaned (go beetles!)?  Want to see parts of autopsies?- Take a forensics course.

We had most adults opt to leave for a minute or even for the rest of the class due to the nature - we had to attempt it but if we felt sick or upset, we were encouraged to leave.  Because this is the first time most people will be exposed to this kind of stuff.  But my teacher at the time explained it like this - if you are seriously considering this field you need to know exactly what you will be dealing with (paralegal) because you will be exposed to all kinds of situations and people.  It is better to know your limits in the safety of school than to causes issues on the job.  Meaning - get some exposure now that way you don't freak in front of someone who desperately needs you to hold it together for them.  \n\nForensic science means something bad has most likely happened and you are dealing with the aftermath - the person, family members, etc.  Being freaked out is okay and normal but she should have excused herself - I have never had a teacher in this field say no you gotta stay here because I can guarantee no one wants to deal with the puke, the hysterics or any of that.\n\nSo, while you may not have been the AH neither was, she (as immature as it sounds - she is just a kid apparently out of her element) - but her parents should have looked at the class description and syllabus.
