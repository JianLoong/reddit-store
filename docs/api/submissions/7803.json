We live in New Zealand, where you do 3 years worth of exams. In the first 2 years she excelled excellently, and was in the top 5%(+) of her year group. \n\nThis year, however, I just got an email that she didn\u2019t pass the year, let alone get University Entrance (2 different sets of requirements). This means that entry into her course and halls of residence has been revoked. I am obviously incredibly angry and disappointed in her- she would now pathetically be considered in the bottom 5% of her school. \n\nWe were at our family friends a couple days ago, where all of the teens who just finished High School were discussing their future plans. Dai mentioned how she was going to take a couple years off from school, where she wanted to continue working to become more \u2018independent\u2019 and then be a Camp Councillor (Camp America) for the summer- where she went on about confidence and all that bs. \n\nThis is when I piped in. I said that Dai was only taking 2 years off as she didn\u2019t actually pass High School and therefore wasn\u2019t able to go to University. I then stated how the mentioning of 2 years was manipulatively stated, as a 2 year wait would allow her to go to University through Adult Entry (despite failing High School), and was therefore not a choice she made. I then looked at the younger kids in the room, and made a mention about how this would be them if they didn\u2019t get their shit together, and continued on Daia\u2019s path of being a pathetic, disorganised and ungrateful teenager. \n\nDai started crying, which she never does, so I felt a little bad- but then realised she bought this on herself. As a final statement on the topic, I said that she can\u2019t just lie to everyone about her future plans because she\u2019s embarrassed of the consequences of her own actions, if she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed she shouldn\u2019t of ended up in this situation. \n\nI got a message from one of the parents last night, asking if Dai wanted to go away for a week with their family. She said that Dai seemed like she needed a \u2018break\u2019, and she especially noticed it after exam results- Dai hasn\u2019t spoken to me since she got her results, and I can barely look at her without feeling so angry, so of course I agreed. \n\nWhen she came to pick her up, however, she had the audacity to say I needed to let it go, and think about if it was the right decision sharing her personal information with the others. She said she was ashamed on my behalf, before abruptly leaving. \n\nI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong, as it was wrong of Dai to lie about the reasons behind her future plans (when she needs to own up to it). However, the comment from the other parent took be by surprise.", "created_utc": 1674180365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gkcgk/aita_for_telling_everyone_my_daughter_is_actually/", "score": 461, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she was taking a couple of years to learn to be independent.  \n\nI get you are angry, but you don't humiliate your kid because you are angry.", "YTA- Dai already feels enough shame, there was no need to publicly embarrass her. I would be more concerned about how and why her grades dropped so dramatically\u2026. Definitely more than \u201claziest\u201d going on here", "Nevermind, YTA, regardless of the reason. She probably needs support and care at this point, as her previous plans may have fallen apart, and here you are making her feel even worse.\n\nINFO: what happened to cause her grades to drop?", "YTA. A sudden decline in performance like that is a signal that something is wrong. Instead of trying to help, you called her lazy, and  then deliberately embarrassed her in front of her friends.", "YTA. Your daughter failed High School?\n\nWhere were you? Aren't you the parent? Weren't you contacted? What actions did you take to correct this path? This is your failure too. Your child is just that. A child. Maybe one that is almost grown but you are still responsible for them. \n\nEmbarrassing them in front of peers like that did nothing to help your child rebound from this and they are going to need to because what's done is done and they are trying to find a path forward and you just crushed them doing what you did.", "YTA\nI live in NZ too. If she was flunking ncea level 3 that badly you would have been notified by her teachers in the first half of the year.\nIf she failed mid-year, you would have been told.\nSo, either this is total BS or you are a neglectful parent who doesn't give a sh#$\nAbout her daughter.\nShe has every right to keep her academic business private. You had not right to expose her the way you did to her friends.\nI can't wait till I see you posting about how your adult daughter has cut you out of her life and poor me I don't know why...    \nGet a grip\nYTA", "YTA. There\u2019s a reason someone drops that far grade wise, and judging by your post you probably have no idea why, or even care about it. When I had a grade drop like that I was being physically abused by my boyfriend at the time. My parents had no idea, even when I tried to tell them. But they did what you did. They didn\u2019t care why. Why didn\u2019t matter, and it was all my fault. Him following me from class to class, locking me in a room with him and tormenting should have never mattered in their eyes. The day I turned 17 I had them sign paperwork to let me enlist because I couldn\u2019t take the criticism or judgement. I couldn\u2019t take the shaming. I enlisted when the war was still in full swing. I thought that joining the military and maybe going to war would still be more peaceful than my home, because my value to them was entirely based on grades. The success they could brag about to other people. Your daughter isn\u2019t your object to shame and praise as you please. She is a whole ass human with emotions, but you used her as a scare tactic for kids. Have you ever thought maybe she doesn\u2019t feel emotionally safe with you? And this behavior is why?", "Geez, is it \"publicly humiliate your children\" day here today??  Yes YTA. She messed up, she knows it, but she has a plan she is working on, and sounds viable. Making mistakes is part of growing up, and she is still growing up. What she needs from you at this stage is support. What she got was anything but. Once she does make her own way in the world, I wouldn't be surprised if she cuts all ties with you. This was pretty toxic behaviour.", "Total YTA. \n\nYou accomplished nothing except embarrassing yourself.  Sure, you daughter probably feels embarrassed too, but everyone in that room knows you\u2019re the AH.  \n\nFor once. Try to support your daughter instead of trying to punish her.  No wonder she wants to work on her confidence and being independent, sounds like you\u2019ve been trying to tear her down.", "YTA\n\nAny moderately competent parent would be concerned about their child\u2019s health and well-being. This kind of abrupt shift is a massive warning sign.\n\nYou are concerned with ensuring that you\u2019re such a huge asshole that the whole neighborhood notices.", "YTA. Overbearing and belittling your child is a good way to make sure your child has absolutely nothing to do with you after they leave. Are you without blame? I doubt it. And would you like someone weponizing those shortcomings to turn them into some sort of messed up teachable moment to massage their own ego? Because that's all you did. You were so embarrassed of your own daughters shortcomings when you heard the other kids talking that you made an excuse to shift the entirety of the situation on to her shoulders in order to make sure EVERYONE at the get together knew you were blameless. It's pretty disgusting. And you've shown your daughter that your love comes at a price and that you have no respect and regard for her in the slightest.", "YTA.\n\nSome people shouldn't have children.", "Yep YTA. Embarrassing her infront of friends is the opposite of being understanding and supportive. Yeah, she's fucking up you know that, help her don't be condescending.", "YTA - she shouldn't have lied but seriously reread what you wrote. Your daughter will resent you for a long time if you don't treat her better. That parent was throwing you a bone so you don't lose her completely.  I feel bad for her having to deal with someone calling her pathetic, lazy, etc. You really should be ashamed.", "Absolutely YTA. It's certainly a shocking drop from top 5% to bottom 5% in the most important year (also a kiwi, been through NCEA) but there's far better ways of dealing with the situation with her than that. What a great role model. I actually think young people are better off taking a year or two off between high school and uni. When I finished high school I had no idea what I actually wanted to do, and almost studied a degree I knew deep down wasn't for me, just to satisfy my parents. I ended up taking a gap year to work, and it gave me plenty of time to truly think things through. Now I'm super happy with my university situation. Your daughter failing to achieve UE is not the end of the world, she can certainly still achieve at a high level at uni in a couple of years' time, especially given her academic success in the past. But you need to do a much better job supporting her.", "YTA \n\nThis better be fake because Jesus Christ do you even like your daughter?", "YTA. You're supposed to support your daughter, not publicly humiliate her. By all means tell her you're disappointed with her *in private*. By demeaning her in public you showed that you're nothing more than an adult bully. Shame on you. You don't think you did anything wrong? Next you'll write that she brought it on herself, look what she made you do.", "YTA for trying to do social circle damage control rather than ask Dai why she took such a downturn. NCEA is set up so that you earn credits over the year as well as end of year exams (and there are midyear exams too for fallback marks), so you obviously weren't paying your daughter any attention. Nothing you say says you realise something went wrong with Dai and tried to help. You don't have any empathy for you daughter, just that she flunked Year 13 and that it's not something you tell others about.\n\nYou need to find out why. Was Dai in a relationship, did something about her life change, was she nervous about life after high school? If she was lying then past experience taught her to, like you've been holding expectations of her for your benefit. This post is all Me Me Me and how her failing inconveniences your image.", "YTA. Asshole isn't a strong enough term for you. You are a giant gaping rectal prolapse.", "YTA. No body needed to know why she wasn't going to Uni. She handled herself well and by the sounds of things, she has a plan. Good for her. She doesn't need you running around telling everyone she failed. Heck, she might be more successful the way she's going.", "Wow you\u2019re just about the biggest AH on here to put your daughter on blast like that publicly.  It was no one\u2019s business at that get together about the reason behind her not going directly to university. \n\nSeriously what kind of parent shames their child like that.  It would serve you right if she goes LC or NC with you.", "YTA\u2026 it was Dai\u2019s information to tell. If she didn\u2019t want to tell, and rather lie, that is on her if her friends find out. Also if Dai was scoring so highly in the beginning of high school, I bet you it\u2019s probably not a trouble with the level of content and rather something deeper.\n\n(Edited for spelling)", "YTA. Is there something going on with your daughter? That caused an otherwise very intelligent girl to drop her grades like this? I would hope that you'd be more concerned rather than angry. Regardless, though, it is her life and not yours. It's pretty inconsiderate to share this information publicly. There's really no reason for anyone else to know.\n\nIs it that you're personally embarrassed by it?", "YTA\n\nYou could try having even an ounce of parental concern about why your smart child is struggling so much.", "Wow. YTA.\n\nDo you feel an ounce of love for your child? Because it sure as hell doesn't sound like it.\n\nGet a grip on yourself.", "YTA. You're supposed to be supportive and there for her. You were not. You humiliated her and shared her inner, probably insecurities at this point, with her friends. And the icing on the cake - you told the younger kids that if they didn't work hard, they would be a failure like your daughter? That is a shitty move.", "YTA. Instead of bashing her in front of others, you should be thinking about how she can improve her current qualifications so she can get into university.\n\nFurthermore, if she doesn't keep up with the academics, taking multiple years off, it's going to be really hard for her to settle back into the groove if she ever does get into university.\n\nUp to this point she'll have been spoonfed by her high school teachers. In university nobody is going to care if she passes or fails. It used to be called \"reading for a degree\" for a reason. There are lecturers, but the students need to do all of the work themselves.\n\nRight now you have the opportunity to try to undo some of what is wrong with her, academically. All I can see from what you wrote is the intention to shame her, and allow the time to be wasted.\n\nGet her into some private tuition, sign up for the entrance exams as a private candidate, and in any spare time she has, let her begin taking the free/paid courses from places like Coursera related to her field of study.\n\nYou're the adult in this situation, start acting like one.", "YTA, there is no reason to call your daughter out like that in public and you are likely partly to blame for her laziness and the fact that she didn\u2019t pass her schooling. Be a responsible parent.", "YTA\n\nYou can be upset and disappointed in your daughter but how does humiliating her in front of friends help matters or give her motivation to succeed?", "YTA. All these parents thinking shaming is going to do anything other than make your kids resent you.", "YTA.  Does your daughter have a parent who loves her?", "I\u2019m really hoping this post is fake. Some kind of joke. If not YTA!!! Humiliation is not a motivator at all! Your poor daughter. My heart breaks for her", "YTA - you called her lazy straight out the gate, didn\u2019t even pause for breath. Everything else is downhill from a very, very low mark from there. Remember this is your daughter who is actually a human being with emotions unlike you in the future.", "YTA. You fail at being a human being and it disgusts me to no end that we're the same species. Go crawl back into whatever slime pit you slithered out of.", "Woooooow. YTA. Dai is absolutely correct, this is her personal info and you need to keep it out of your mouth. \n\nDo you even want your child to succeed in life or not? Bc honestly, you are being horrible to her. Seriously. She already feels bad. This isn\u2019t helping, this isn\u2019t guiding or motivating or addressing the issues that got her here. This is you publicly shaming her bc you have issues. Knock it off, apologize to your kid, and HELP her figure out a way forward.", " YTA for so many reasons. One of them is you have no interest or curiosity about why & how your daughter did such a complete turnaround from doing great to failing. You just want to punish her. Learn a lesson when family friends care more for your daughter\u2019s well being than you do.", "Dai, if you're reading this, yes, your parent was being a complete AH. You deserve respect, kindness and support. You're not alone; this awful feeling when your parent isn't there for you when things are going badly is very painful and real and valid. \n\nParent, if you really wrote this, you are losing your daughter. Act now to make reparations and get your priorities straight. You have a child who is trying to recover from a big setback, from sadness, from embarrassment, and now from a major breach of privacy and humiliation from you, their parent, who they need more than anyone to be in their court.", "Teens rarely go from being high achieving  and accomplished to failing and \"lazy\" without a reason. \n\nYour overbearing attitude and controlling behavior in this situation points to what the real problem is.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Good luck having any relationship with your daughter when she inevitably goes NC with you.", "YTA young people do stupid things. A public shaming isn\u2019t the right way to deal with it.", "OMG YTA you're really a horrible witch. No need to embarrass your child. And, in case it didn't occur to you, there are useful and fulfilling avenues they can pursue other than college as well if academics are not their thing.", "Yta usually when kid fall that hard it's because something Bad happened. If other parents feel they have to save your daughter from yourself yah I Guess you really failed.", "Sorry but not sorry OP but YTA. Have a heart will you?", "This is one where I honestly can\u2019t believe you have to ask.  YTA.  Your daughter has suffered a major life-altering setback that is going to impact the rest of her adult life - maybe it\u2019s because of her choices, maybe there are other factors, but does that really matter now?  It\u2019s done and she needs to move forward.  Yes, she\u2019s putting a good face on things  - what to you want her to do, go around crying in shame?  You humiliated her on purpose, you\u2019re taking her failure as a personal affront, and you\u2019re angry that she\u2019s doing the responsible thing and finding a positive way forward from here.  All you care about is that she suffer for disappointing you.  Just guessing here, but I doubt she\u2019d describe you as the pick of the litter either, as a parent.", "YTA", "This can't be real. Please tell me that this is not real, but some made-up post.\n\nYTA, the biggest and worst kind. The kind who humiliates their daughter instead of perhaps asking why the daughter failed that year when she did so well in the past. And then labels daughter with \"pathetic\" for that failure, when the parent's decision was the pathetic thing here. The lack of respect for her as a human being (and someone who trusted you and should believe you are in her corner) is stunning.\n\nGood God. Have you even considered what turmoil your daughter has been going through over the past year? That perhaps she suffered a trauma that you are oblivious to? That she might be going through depression or other mental health issue? Are you trying to drive her completely out of your life (or towards self-harm)?\n\nThe fact that you behaved in this way, called confidence-building activities BS, and are \"surprised\" at the comment from the other parent (thank goodness they spoke up) tells me that it's likely your daughter has been subjected to pretty bad parenting thus far in her life.\n\nDai will likely never see this post since you are being soundly excoriated. But if she does - Dai, please know that you are not pathetic, not a failure, not disorganized, not ungrateful. You go on and do your thing, whether it's being a camp counselor for a while or some other growth activity. You will succeed. You are intelligent. You have great potential.

It can be mental health, stress, relationships with classmates and teachers, etc. as a parent your job is to lift your kid up to help her when she needs it not be disappointed in her.

Have you considered this?\n\nHave you also considered what's affecting her difficulties with motivation? It's not just about want. She's probably struggling with something. Lack of motivation, much like anger, doesn't exist in a vacuum. There's usually something driving it. She could have been struggling with anxiety, ADHD, or depression. With those things, executive function goes right out the window. She may have wanted to do what she needed to do but was otherwise incapable because her brain couldn't connect the desire to action.\n\nOn top of that, you just shamed your own daughter in front of her friends.

I am obviously incredibly angry and disappointed in her- she would now pathetically be considered in the bottom 5% of her school. \n\nWe were at our family friends a couple days ago, where all of the teens who just finished High School were discussing their future plans. Dai mentioned how she was going to take a couple years off from school, where she wanted to continue working to become more \u2018independent\u2019 and then be a Camp Councillor (Camp America) for the summer- where she went on about confidence and all that bs. \n\nThis is when I piped in.

I then stated how the mentioning of 2 years was manipulatively stated, as a 2 year wait would allow her to go to University through Adult Entry (despite failing High School), and was therefore not a choice she made. I then looked at the younger kids in the room, and made a mention about how this would be them if they didn\u2019t get their shit together, and continued on Daia\u2019s path of being a pathetic, disorganised and ungrateful teenager. \n\nDai started crying, which she never does, so I felt a little bad- but then realised she bought this on herself. As a final statement on the topic, I said that she can\u2019t just lie to everyone about her future plans because she\u2019s embarrassed of the consequences of her own actions, if she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed she shouldn\u2019t of ended up in this situation. \n\nI got a message from one of the parents last night, asking if Dai wanted to go away for a week with their family. She said that Dai seemed like she needed a \u2018break\u2019, and she especially noticed it after exam results- Dai hasn\u2019t spoken to me since she got her results, and I can barely look at her without feeling so angry, so of course I agreed. \n\nWhen she came to pick her up, however, she had the audacity to say I needed to let it go, and think about if it was the right decision sharing her personal information with the others. She said she was ashamed on my behalf, before abruptly leaving. \n\nI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong, as it was wrong of Dai to lie about the reasons behind her future plans (when she needs to own up to it).

You shouldn\u2019t have called her \u201cpathetic, disorganized, and ungrateful\u201d. She didn\u2019t actually \u201clie\u201d. Your daughter didn\u2019t even lie! She simply said what her plans were, and they sound like good, reasonable next steps. University doesn\u2019t define or guarantee success! There are other paths that young people can take. For you to completely overstep her personal boundaries in front of other people was just entirely unnecessary and hurtful. You can\u2019t just wish away or ignore depression, grief, or anxiety. Your daughter is still deserving of support and kindness. You didn\u2019t need to embarrass her in front of *other people*. What did you even gain from this? That\u2019s a genuine question. What did you *gain* from this??????? It boggles my mind that a parent would do this to their own *child*. As her mother, it is ideally your role to guide and help her. It *isn\u2019t* your job to belittle and degrade her because she didn\u2019t live up to your standards or your expectations. Where is your empathy? Where is your sympathy? I just can\u2019t believe that you are *so* oblivious to your own brutal behaviour. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t even need to be said, but I also think it\u2019s important to note that your daughter is her own person who doesn\u2019t *need* to live by your rules. She has her own agency as an individual. *You* may have standards and expectations for your daughter, but I think you also have to understand that it is *okay* if she chooses her own path and makes her *own* decisions. I *genuinely* think that you need to reevaluate your parenting style because your attitude and outlook towards Dai is just *wrong*. It\u2019s entirely wrong.

Grief is different for everyone and even though it was 5 years ago, considering her age, it could very well be a factor. Children who lose their parents deal with it their whole lives. I've seen it. My godson lost his father over 20 years ago and it STILL affects his life and decisions he makes. \nYou need to talk and actually LISTEN to your daughter with an open mind and open heart.", "YTA - \n\nAs a father to a young child, I'm generally surprised by how many parents write on here with such a low level of compassion to their children.\n\nA high performing individual whose output suddenly collapses is usually not associated with laziness, but with other problems. As her performance was declining, did you make any attempts to get help?  \n\n\nAlso, at what point in her upbringing did you decide that the best course of action would be to publicly shame her rather than try to support her? When did you think you could treat her worse than you would treat any adult you respect?  \n\n\nI'm genuinely curious as to whether posters like OP always had this mindset, or whether they were extremely nurturing parents when their kids were little and it slowly degraded, or whether there was an event that made them shift gears.", "This really boiled my piss. YTA. \n\nI get it, you\u2019re mad that your daughter fucked up. But it\u2019s on her. Not you. She didn\u2019t lie because she didn\u2019t tell anyone she passed high school OR got into uni. She\u2019s telling the truth by saying she wants to take two years and figure herself out. It doesn\u2019t matter the conclusion that got her there. \n\nThat\u2019s a huge asshole move for you to go over her head and tell everyone something incredibly sensitive that she clearly didn\u2019t want people to know. \n\nYou know, I did absolutely shit at school. Failed most of my high school exams, retook my first year of college (of an art program anyway, so already a failure in my fathers eyes). And guess what, I lied to my dad about everything because he made me feel like absolute shit that I wasn\u2019t an academic miracle. Now it\u2019s been over a decade since all that and I also took a year out after college (which, as stated, I took an extra year to complete) (note: college is generally a two-year thing between high school and university in my country). I ended up travelling then got my bachelors degree, then I worked and travelled more and moved country and moved country again and got my masters degree. It worked out. \n\nGive your child support or shut the fuck up. Life isn\u2019t made at the end of high school. Some people aren\u2019t ready for serious exams or big life decisions at ages 16-20. Some people need more time (and extra support). Your child is going to have huge trust problems with you and probably won\u2019t want to share her successes either since you made her feel so shit about her failures.", "First of all, laziness isn\u2019t real. If someone isn\u2019t doing something, there is a reason for it, especially when it is an abrupt change from past performance. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether you personally feel those reasons are valid or not, but people who are unable to perform at a certain level still deserve support and understanding rather than derision. \n\nSecond, university isn\u2019t for everyone, and people who don\u2019t get into university (or choose not to go to university) aren\u2019t pathetic. It certainly doesn\u2019t change their worth as a person. \n\nThird, it is absolutely up to your daughter how she wants to present her circumstances, and who she wants to discuss them with at all. It\u2019s absolutely not your place to divulge her personal business or decide what she\u2019s obligated to tell people. It\u2019s especially not your place when your whole goal is to try to humiliate and shame your daughter into performing better (which, by the way, has been shown over and over to be ineffective). \n\nLong story short, YTA. \n\nI hope your daughter enjoys the next two years and has valuable experiences away from you that will help her decide what kind of life she wants. I have lifelong friends who worked with me at camps here in the US through Camp America. She deserves some great life experiences without you dragging her down.", "YTA. You\u2019re such a shitty and judgmental parent man lol. Look forward to your daughter not talking to you at all as she moves on with her life.", "She was lying..  If she big enough to fluff up her own life, then she big enough to not lie.  You need to let it go and let the chips fall where they may...", "This can\u2019t be real.", "**YTA so much!** You didn't notice when she was struggling, you didn't help her, and now you're using your own, in your words, \"pathetic\" daughter as an example to the whole room. Now, you can \"barely look at her.\" You are a **horrible mother**!\n\n\\> I then looked at the younger kids in the room, and made a mention about how this would be them if they didn\u2019t get their shit together, and continued on Daia\u2019s path of being a pathetic, disorganised and ungrateful teenager.", "YTA!!!", "YTA. Can\u2019t wait for your post titled \u201cwhy hadn\u2019t my daughter spoken to me in years\u201d", "Wow so her dad died and you called her lazy. Maybe she needed some help? You didn\u2019t question a sudden decline besides saying she doesn\u2019t care? Also how did you not notice she was failing for a year. YTA for sure. How do you know she was lying btw? What if those were her plans? Did you ever talk to her or are you projecting. I\u2019d be upset to but it sound like you weren\u2019t very involved or helpful. Was it dad who died who was and that\u2019s why she was so good?", "YTA.\n\nWhen a teen\u2019s grades tank like that, it\u2019s usually for a reason and suddenly becoming lazy isn\u2019t it.\n\nRather than address whatever it is that\u2019s causing the issue, you humiliated her in front of everyone.\n\nYou\u2019re lucky that didn\u2019t push her to self-harm.", "Im not sure where the comment is but apparently her dad died... so yeah reason enough to not really want to focus on school", "Going from top 5% to bottom 5% I'm less than a year screams issue she needs help with, probably a significant trauma.\n\n**Edit:** of just saw another comment say her dad died last year. Wow, I wonder if that had anything to do with it.   /s", "someone that that OPs wine away, she's had enough", "username checks out", "You sound like an awesome parent. I'm sure your child appreciates it. \ud83d\udc99", "Someone said some additional information was revealed that her father died that year.\n\nEDIT: apparently years ago, not the last year.", "Yes. When children withdraw from their relationship with their parent to the extent that the Op's kid did, the parent ignores a ton of school reports, and other parents pick up on how bad the parenting is, something is clearly terribly wrong with how the OP was parenting.", "But why use shame as a motivator? If anything that is not going to light a fire in her belly but pour water on her firewood. She needs encouragement, not to be constantly told that she's a screw-up.", "Maybe having an awful mom is an 'external factor'.", "YTA. You are an awful mother and a horrible human being to treat your daughter like this and call her pathetic in front of her friends. She needs help and support, and with the way you're treating her right now, no wonder she's going to find that somewhere else (and that another actual GOOD parent noticed this before you did). \n\nIf you do not apologize, recognise you were in the wrong and try to help her out as soon as you can, you are going to lose her forever. If you actually care about her and about your relationship with her, I highly suggest you start with those three things. The next step would be to bring her to a doctor/enroll her into therapy to check both her physical and mental health, because a sudden decline of grades like that is not normal.\n\nAnd finally, I would suggest that YOU also need go to therapy. It isn't normal for a parent to bully their own children like that, and I believe you need to do some hard introspection before you not only lose your relationship with your daughter, but also other people.", "You think about her, but you don't do anything with her. You didn't know she was failing until she failed. You're completely unconcerned with asking her with actual empathy to understand what's going on. You're covering your failure in parenting by blaming your child instead of understand what you could have done to be more present of a parent. \n\nI was a gifted student, top of my class until my senior year, until I was sexually assaulted by a classmate and didn't have anyone I could turn to. It was all I could think about and nothing seemed worth doing because I felt like a failure who deserved it. I also couldn't tell anyone, nobody cared about the change in behavior, and I was also called lazy despite having exceeding performance for all 11/12 years of my schooling experience.", "No, you don't. You haven't shown us that.\n\nDid you even read what you wrote in the original post??\n\nI've never an AITA post that was so blatantly hateful, mean, vindictive, and straight up CRUEL. You don't sound like you love her. You sound like you hate her.\n\nYou don't give a shit about her well-being. You care about her grades. About how much of a \"good daughter\" she can be.\n\nDo you even see her as a person? Or just a failed toy?", "YTA. I sincerely hope she is able to surround herself with supportive and loving people as well as receive whatever necessary, mental/emotional health care, and can cut you out of her life until you can do some serious self reflection, and become a better person.", "you don't even sound like you LIKE your daughter. I'm not sure why you posted on AITA if you didn't want someone to tell you whether YTA or not", "I have noticed with kids sometimes the grief doesn\u2019t hit until they are older. I know a child who lost their one parent when they were 3. Lost their other parent when they were 10. Lost their maternal grandparent somewhere in there. They were living with their dying grandparent. The grief hit them when they were about 13/14. We spent a lot of time talking about their grief and how they didn\u2019t understand what they lost until they were older.\n\nI could see the daughter getting to a big milestone like that and realizing dad was not there to see it. That bought up a lot of feelings. Since Op didn\u2019t noticed what was happening, the poor girl crashed and burned.", "Yup, almost everyone turns 18 at some point in their final year (in NZ). Parents will still be updated.", "Yooo, type one diabetes was what got me! I was drinking gallons, lost four and a half-stone. My mother put her hand on my stomach while I was in the ICU hospital bed and shook it and told me I only had a little bit left to lose (I was underweight and thought I was fat because the IV brought the water weight back onto me). I feel bad for OP's kid. She could have been flourishing, now she might be dying in some way and burdened by the shame on top. :/\n\nOne of my friends failed out though and went the travel + Camp America route and they're loving life, engaged to be married. Chances are their kid'll find their feet and never go home to her, which imo, is a happy ending."]}
