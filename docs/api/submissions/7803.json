We live in New Zealand, where you do 3 years worth of exams. In the first 2 years she excelled excellently, and was in the top 5%(+) of her year group. \n\nThis year, however, I just got an email that she didn\u2019t pass the year, let alone get University Entrance (2 different sets of requirements). This means that entry into her course and halls of residence has been revoked. I am obviously incredibly angry and disappointed in her- she would now pathetically be considered in the bottom 5% of her school. \n\nWe were at our family friends a couple days ago, where all of the teens who just finished High School were discussing their future plans. Dai mentioned how she was going to take a couple years off from school, where she wanted to continue working to become more \u2018independent\u2019 and then be a Camp Councillor (Camp America) for the summer- where she went on about confidence and all that bs. \n\nThis is when I piped in. I said that Dai was only taking 2 years off as she didn\u2019t actually pass High School and therefore wasn\u2019t able to go to University. I then stated how the mentioning of 2 years was manipulatively stated, as a 2 year wait would allow her to go to University through Adult Entry (despite failing High School), and was therefore not a choice she made. I then looked at the younger kids in the room, and made a mention about how this would be them if they didn\u2019t get their shit together, and continued on Daia\u2019s path of being a pathetic, disorganised and ungrateful teenager. \n\nDai started crying, which she never does, so I felt a little bad- but then realised she bought this on herself. As a final statement on the topic, I said that she can\u2019t just lie to everyone about her future plans because she\u2019s embarrassed of the consequences of her own actions, if she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed she shouldn\u2019t of ended up in this situation. \n\nI got a message from one of the parents last night, asking if Dai wanted to go away for a week with their family. She said that Dai seemed like she needed a \u2018break\u2019, and she especially noticed it after exam results- Dai hasn\u2019t spoken to me since she got her results, and I can barely look at her without feeling so angry, so of course I agreed. \n\nWhen she came to pick her up, however, she had the audacity to say I needed to let it go, and think about if it was the right decision sharing her personal information with the others. She said she was ashamed on my behalf, before abruptly leaving. \n\nI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong, as it was wrong of Dai to lie about the reasons behind her future plans (when she needs to own up to it). However, the comment from the other parent took be by surprise.", "created_utc": 1674180365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gkcgk/aita_for_telling_everyone_my_daughter_is_actually/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she was taking a couple of years to learn to be independent.  \n\nI get you are angry, but you don't humiliate your kid because you are angry.", "YTA- Dai already feels enough shame, there was no need to publicly embarrass her. I would be more concerned about how and why her grades dropped so dramatically\u2026. Definitely more than \u201claziest\u201d going on here", "Nevermind, YTA, regardless of the reason. She probably needs support and care at this point, as her previous plans may have fallen apart, and here you are making her feel even worse.\n\nINFO: what happened to cause her grades to drop?", "YTA. A sudden decline in performance like that is a signal that something is wrong. Instead of trying to help, you called her lazy, and  then deliberately embarrassed her in front of her friends.", "YTA. Your daughter failed High School?\n\nWhere were you? Aren't you the parent? Weren't you contacted? What actions did you take to correct this path? This is your failure too. Your child is just that. A child. Maybe one that is almost grown but you are still responsible for them. \n\nEmbarrassing them in front of peers like that did nothing to help your child rebound from this and they are going to need to because what's done is done and they are trying to find a path forward and you just crushed them doing what you did.", "YTA\nI live in NZ too. If she was flunking ncea level 3 that badly you would have been notified by her teachers in the first half of the year.\nIf she failed mid-year, you would have been told.\nSo, either this is total BS or you are a neglectful parent who doesn't give a sh#$\nAbout her daughter.\nShe has every right to keep her academic business private. You had not right to expose her the way you did to her friends.\nI can't wait till I see you posting about how your adult daughter has cut you out of her life and poor me I don't know why...    \nGet a grip\nYTA", "YTA. There\u2019s a reason someone drops that far grade wise, and judging by your post you probably have no idea why, or even care about it. When I had a grade drop like that I was being physically abused by my boyfriend at the time. My parents had no idea, even when I tried to tell them. But they did what you did. They didn\u2019t care why. Why didn\u2019t matter, and it was all my fault. Him following me from class to class, locking me in a room with him and tormenting should have never mattered in their eyes. The day I turned 17 I had them sign paperwork to let me enlist because I couldn\u2019t take the criticism or judgement. I couldn\u2019t take the shaming. I enlisted when the war was still in full swing. I thought that joining the military and maybe going to war would still be more peaceful than my home, because my value to them was entirely based on grades. The success they could brag about to other people. Your daughter isn\u2019t your object to shame and praise as you please. She is a whole ass human with emotions, but you used her as a scare tactic for kids. Have you ever thought maybe she doesn\u2019t feel emotionally safe with you? And this behavior is why?", "Geez, is it \"publicly humiliate your children\" day here today??  Yes YTA. She messed up, she knows it, but she has a plan she is working on, and sounds viable. Making mistakes is part of growing up, and she is still growing up. What she needs from you at this stage is support. What she got was anything but. Once she does make her own way in the world, I wouldn't be surprised if she cuts all ties with you. This was pretty toxic behaviour.", "Total YTA. \n\nYou accomplished nothing except embarrassing yourself.  Sure, you daughter probably feels embarrassed too, but everyone in that room knows you\u2019re the AH.  \n\nFor once. Try to support your daughter instead of trying to punish her.  No wonder she wants to work on her confidence and being independent, sounds like you\u2019ve been trying to tear her down.", "YTA\n\nAny moderately competent parent would be concerned about their child\u2019s health and well-being. This kind of abrupt shift is a massive warning sign.\n\nYou are concerned with ensuring that you\u2019re such a huge asshole that the whole neighborhood notices.", "YTA. Overbearing and belittling your child is a good way to make sure your child has absolutely nothing to do with you after they leave. Are you without blame? I doubt it. And would you like someone weponizing those shortcomings to turn them into some sort of messed up teachable moment to massage their own ego? Because that's all you did. You were so embarrassed of your own daughters shortcomings when you heard the other kids talking that you made an excuse to shift the entirety of the situation on to her shoulders in order to make sure EVERYONE at the get together knew you were blameless. It's pretty disgusting. And you've shown your daughter that your love comes at a price and that you have no respect and regard for her in the slightest.", "YTA.\n\nSome people shouldn't have children.", "Yep YTA. Embarrassing her infront of friends is the opposite of being understanding and supportive. Yeah, she's fucking up you know that, help her don't be condescending.", "YTA - she shouldn't have lied but seriously reread what you wrote. Your daughter will resent you for a long time if you don't treat her better. That parent was throwing you a bone so you don't lose her completely.  I feel bad for her having to deal with someone calling her pathetic, lazy, etc. You really should be ashamed.", "Absolutely YTA. It's certainly a shocking drop from top 5% to bottom 5% in the most important year (also a kiwi, been through NCEA) but there's far better ways of dealing with the situation with her than that. What a great role model. I actually think young people are better off taking a year or two off between high school and uni. When I finished high school I had no idea what I actually wanted to do, and almost studied a degree I knew deep down wasn't for me, just to satisfy my parents. I ended up taking a gap year to work, and it gave me plenty of time to truly think things through. Now I'm super happy with my university situation. Your daughter failing to achieve UE is not the end of the world, she can certainly still achieve at a high level at uni in a couple of years' time, especially given her academic success in the past. But you need to do a much better job supporting her.", "YTA \n\nThis better be fake because Jesus Christ do you even like your daughter?", "YTA. You're supposed to support your daughter, not publicly humiliate her. By all means tell her you're disappointed with her *in private*. By demeaning her in public you showed that you're nothing more than an adult bully. Shame on you. You don't think you did anything wrong? Next you'll write that she brought it on herself, look what she made you do.", "YTA for trying to do social circle damage control rather than ask Dai why she took such a downturn. NCEA is set up so that you earn credits over the year as well as end of year exams (and there are midyear exams too for fallback marks), so you obviously weren't paying your daughter any attention. Nothing you say says you realise something went wrong with Dai and tried to help. You don't have any empathy for you daughter, just that she flunked Year 13 and that it's not something you tell others about.\n\nYou need to find out why. Was Dai in a relationship, did something about her life change, was she nervous about life after high school? If she was lying then past experience taught her to, like you've been holding expectations of her for your benefit. This post is all Me Me Me and how her failing inconveniences your image.", "YTA. Asshole isn't a strong enough term for you. You are a giant gaping rectal prolapse.", "YTA. No body needed to know why she wasn't going to Uni. She handled herself well and by the sounds of things, she has a plan. Good for her. She doesn't need you running around telling everyone she failed. Heck, she might be more successful the way she's going.", "Wow you\u2019re just about the biggest AH on here to put your daughter on blast like that publicly.  It was no one\u2019s business at that get together about the reason behind her not going directly to university. \n\nSeriously what kind of parent shames their child like that.  It would serve you right if she goes LC or NC with you.", "YTA\u2026 it was Dai\u2019s information to tell. If she didn\u2019t want to tell, and rather lie, that is on her if her friends find out. Also if Dai was scoring so highly in the beginning of high school, I bet you it\u2019s probably not a trouble with the level of content and rather something deeper.\n\n(Edited for spelling)", "YTA. Is there something going on with your daughter? That caused an otherwise very intelligent girl to drop her grades like this? I would hope that you'd be more concerned rather than angry. Regardless, though, it is her life and not yours. It's pretty inconsiderate to share this information publicly. There's really no reason for anyone else to know.\n\nIs it that you're personally embarrassed by it?", "YTA\n\nYou could try having even an ounce of parental concern about why your smart child is struggling so much.", "Wow. YTA.\n\nDo you feel an ounce of love for your child? Because it sure as hell doesn't sound like it.\n\nGet a grip on yourself.", "YTA. You're supposed to be supportive and there for her. You were not. You humiliated her and shared her inner, probably insecurities at this point, with her friends. And the icing on the cake - you told the younger kids that if they didn't work hard, they would be a failure like your daughter? That is a shitty move.", "YTA. Instead of bashing her in front of others, you should be thinking about how she can improve her current qualifications so she can get into university.\n\nFurthermore, if she doesn't keep up with the academics, taking multiple years off, it's going to be really hard for her to settle back into the groove if she ever does get into university.\n\nUp to this point she'll have been spoonfed by her high school teachers. In university nobody is going to care if she passes or fails. It used to be called \"reading for a degree\" for a reason. There are lecturers, but the students need to do all of the work themselves.\n\nRight now you have the opportunity to try to undo some of what is wrong with her, academically. All I can see from what you wrote is the intention to shame her, and allow the time to be wasted.\n\nGet her into some private tuition, sign up for the entrance exams as a private candidate, and in any spare time she has, let her begin taking the free/paid courses from places like Coursera related to her field of study.\n\nYou're the adult in this situation, start acting like one.", "YTA, there is no reason to call your daughter out like that in public and you are likely partly to blame for her laziness and the fact that she didn\u2019t pass her schooling. Be a responsible parent.", "YTA\n\nYou can be upset and disappointed in your daughter but how does humiliating her in front of friends help matters or give her motivation to succeed?", "YTA. All these parents thinking shaming is going to do anything other than make your kids resent you.", "YTA.  Does your daughter have a parent who loves her?", "I\u2019m really hoping this post is fake. Some kind of joke. If not YTA!!! Humiliation is not a motivator at all! Your poor daughter. My heart breaks for her", "YTA - you called her lazy straight out the gate, didn\u2019t even pause for breath. Everything else is downhill from a very, very low mark from there. Remember this is your daughter who is actually a human being with emotions unlike you in the future.", "YTA. You fail at being a human being and it disgusts me to no end that we're the same species. Go crawl back into whatever slime pit you slithered out of.", "Woooooow. YTA. Dai is absolutely correct, this is her personal info and you need to keep it out of your mouth. \n\nDo you even want your child to succeed in life or not? Bc honestly, you are being horrible to her. Seriously. She already feels bad. This isn\u2019t helping, this isn\u2019t guiding or motivating or addressing the issues that got her here. This is you publicly shaming her bc you have issues. Knock it off, apologize to your kid, and HELP her figure out a way forward.", " YTA for so many reasons. One of them is you have no interest or curiosity about why & how your daughter did such a complete turnaround from doing great to failing. You just want to punish her. Learn a lesson when family friends care more for your daughter\u2019s well being than you do.", "Dai, if you're reading this, yes, your parent was being a complete AH. You deserve respect, kindness and support. You're not alone; this awful feeling when your parent isn't there for you when things are going badly is very painful and real and valid. \n\nParent, if you really wrote this, you are losing your daughter. Act now to make reparations and get your priorities straight. You have a child who is trying to recover from a big setback, from sadness, from embarrassment, and now from a major breach of privacy and humiliation from you, their parent, who they need more than anyone to be in their court.", "Teens rarely go from being high achieving  and accomplished to failing and \"lazy\" without a reason. \n\nYour overbearing attitude and controlling behavior in this situation points to what the real problem is.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Good luck having any relationship with your daughter when she inevitably goes NC with you.", "YTA young people do stupid things. A public shaming isn\u2019t the right way to deal with it.", "OMG YTA you're really a horrible witch. No need to embarrass your child. And, in case it didn't occur to you, there are useful and fulfilling avenues they can pursue other than college as well if academics are not their thing.", "Yta usually when kid fall that hard it's because something Bad happened. If other parents feel they have to save your daughter from yourself yah I Guess you really failed.", "Sorry but not sorry OP but YTA. Have a heart will you?", "This is one where I honestly can\u2019t believe you have to ask.  YTA.  Your daughter has suffered a major life-altering setback that is going to impact the rest of her adult life - maybe it\u2019s because of her choices, maybe there are other factors, but does that really matter now?  It\u2019s done and she needs to move forward.  Yes, she\u2019s putting a good face on things  - what to you want her to do, go around crying in shame?  You humiliated her on purpose, you\u2019re taking her failure as a personal affront, and you\u2019re angry that she\u2019s doing the responsible thing and finding a positive way forward from here.  All you care about is that she suffer for disappointing you.  Just guessing here, but I doubt she\u2019d describe you as the pick of the litter either, as a parent.", "YTA", "This can't be real. Please tell me that this is not real, but some made-up post.\n\nYTA, the biggest and worst kind. The kind who humiliates their daughter instead of perhaps asking why the daughter failed that year when she did so well in the past. And then labels daughter with \"pathetic\" for that failure, when the parent's decision was the pathetic thing here. The lack of respect for her as a human being (and someone who trusted you and should believe you are in her corner) is stunning.\n\nGood God. Have you even considered what turmoil your daughter has been going through over the past year? That perhaps she suffered a trauma that you are oblivious to? That she might be going through depression or other mental health issue? Are you trying to drive her completely out of your life (or towards self-harm)?\n\nThe fact that you behaved in this way, called confidence-building activities BS, and are \"surprised\" at the comment from the other parent (thank goodness they spoke up) tells me that it's likely your daughter has been subjected to pretty bad parenting thus far in her life.\n\nDai will likely never see this post since you are being soundly excoriated. But if she does - Dai, please know that you are not pathetic, not a failure, not disorganized, not ungrateful. You go on and do your thing, whether it's being a camp counselor for a while or some other growth activity. You will succeed. You are intelligent. You have great potential.

It can be mental health, stress, relationships with classmates and teachers, etc. as a parent your job is to lift your kid up to help her when she needs it not be disappointed in her.

Have you considered this?\n\nHave you also considered what's affecting her difficulties with motivation? It's not just about want. She's probably struggling with something. Lack of motivation, much like anger, doesn't exist in a vacuum. There's usually something driving it. She could have been struggling with anxiety, ADHD, or depression. With those things, executive function goes right out the window. She may have wanted to do what she needed to do but was otherwise incapable because her brain couldn't connect the desire to action.\n\nOn top of that, you just shamed your own daughter in front of her friends.

In the first 2 years she excelled excellently, and was in the top 5%(+) of her year group. \n\nThis year, however, I just got an email that she didn\u2019t pass the year, let alone get University Entrance (2 different sets of requirements). This means that entry into her course and halls of residence has been revoked. I am obviously incredibly angry and disappointed in her- she would now pathetically be considered in the bottom 5% of her school. \n\nWe were at our family friends a couple days ago, where all of the teens who just finished High School were discussing their future plans. Dai mentioned how she was going to take a couple years off from school, where she wanted to continue working to become more \u2018independent\u2019 and then be a Camp Councillor (Camp America) for the summer- where she went on about confidence and all that bs. \n\nThis is when I piped in. I said that Dai was only taking 2 years off as she didn\u2019t actually pass High School and therefore wasn\u2019t able to go to University. I then stated how the mentioning of 2 years was manipulatively stated, as a 2 year wait would allow her to go to University through Adult Entry (despite failing High School), and was therefore not a choice she made. I then looked at the younger kids in the room, and made a mention about how this would be them if they didn\u2019t get their shit together, and continued on Daia\u2019s path of being a pathetic, disorganised and ungrateful teenager. \n\nDai started crying, which she never does, so I felt a little bad- but then realised she bought this on herself. As a final statement on the topic, I said that she can\u2019t just lie to everyone about her future plans because she\u2019s embarrassed of the consequences of her own actions, if she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed she shouldn\u2019t of ended up in this situation. \n\nI got a message from one of the parents last night, asking if Dai wanted to go away for a week with their family. She said that Dai seemed like she needed a \u2018break\u2019, and she especially noticed it after exam results- Dai hasn\u2019t spoken to me since she got her results, and I can barely look at her without feeling so angry, so of course I agreed. \n\nWhen she came to pick her up, however, she had the audacity to say I needed to let it go, and think about if it was the right decision sharing her personal information with the others. She said she was ashamed on my behalf, before abruptly leaving. \n\nI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong, as it was wrong of Dai to lie about the reasons behind her future plans (when she needs to own up to it). However, the comment from the other parent took be by surprise.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
