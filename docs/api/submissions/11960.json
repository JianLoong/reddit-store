With our first baby she claimed she hated videogames so I just stopped playing videogames until after our daughter was born. This time however she's getting irritated about the pets. She says the dog barks and makes her head ache, I told her to just let it go outside if the weather is nice but she said that pets are my responsibility so she won't do that. Well what else can she do? I am working so I can't go home and let the dog out whenever she feels like it. She then complained because she opened a can of \"fish\" the other day and it turned out to be cat's food, suddenly I was the one to blame again although she made the mistake. She also started talking about how cats or dogs fur can be dangerous for the baby or herself. This has been going on for weeks, every day she has a new complain when I get home. \n\nA few days ago she finally suggested the great idea of finding the cats and the dog a new house because she can't put up with them anymore. I try to just let it go because I know she's irritated but she just won't drop it. Yesterday we were having an argument because I had to stay an extra hour and half in work so I was late for walking the dog and it was barking a lot (according to her), I'm pretty tired of it by now so I'm getting angry at her, she told me again to get rid of the pets but this time I snapped at her. Our argument got worse, she told me I cared more about the pets than about her and I told her she was right. \n\nShe never had a health complication related to the pets and they were with us before our first pregnancy. I think she's ridiculous and she's trying to get me to be angry and start an argument. I know what I said wasn't ideal but what else she wanted me to say?

She needs to learn coping techniques that don\u2019t involve just eliminating whatever annoys her.  You just fully giving up your gaming hobby during her first pregnancy was very generous and considerate.  It\u2019s cruel to try to get rid of your pets the same way she stopped you gaming.  I\u2019m betting that your generosity in the first situation is part of why she expects to get rid of the pets - you bent over backwards for her before, so she expects you to again.\n\nShe needs to understand that temporarily giving up some of your electronics is not remotely the same as giving up family members, and your pets are family to you. NTA", "NTA. I understand hormones and pregnancy can change her brain. It still isn\u2019t an excuse to expect you to cruelly rehome your animals. Yes, you prob shouldn\u2019t have said you love them more, but she\u2019s the bigger AH in this situation. And you both need therapy.", "I have been pregnant four times and I have gotten so cranky\u2026 pets are family. She is using the pregnancy as an excuse to get rid of them. The only thing that she can be around is the litter box. No, what you said was not ideal but I understand where you are coming from when someone is trying to get rid of your pet children that you care for. Your wife needs some support and she needs to work through whatever it is she is dealing with. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. I am firmly on the side that pets are forever when you bring them into your home. Barring aggression, of course. She can't just decide to her ird of pets because she's too lazy to do anything with them....like she won't even let the dog outside?! I don't think pregnancy has anything to do with it...she's just being a controlling asshole because she thinks she can bully you into it and use pregnancy as an excuse.", "First of all, I\u2019d get an inside camera to see if the dog actually barks a lot. The answer to that question wouldn\u2019t influence my actions but I would want to know the truth. And you don\u2019t rehome pets , let alone when you are pregnant with temporary crazy hormones. I would be absolutely irate with her. And honestly, pets give unconditional love - they aren\u2019t complaining about your wife and her whining and expecting you to choose between them so I get why you answered the way you did.", "NTA. You\u2019re human. You snapped. It happens. Apologize. Explain she had just pushed too far and you were tired and snapped. You\u2019re adults. People act like they never snapped before or said something stupid.", "NTA\n\nI like how everyone is sticking up for your wife and painting she's a saint and you're the villain I mean what else could I expect from this thread? \n\nYou always look after your pets\n\nShe doesn't do anything for them apart from feed them every so often\n\nShe wanted the pets as much as you hence why you got a dog together but she doesn't do anything for it?\n\nIt seems to me, she's literally focusing on anything you like or do. She literally made you stop playing video games while she was pregnant, she now wants you to get rid of your pets all I'm saying is if these roles were reversed you would be dubbed TA straight away because you are a man and she would be told red flags, run away and everything else this thread normally says. She needs help and therapy. Why is her major negative focus on you and everything around you and while she's pregnant?", "INFO: from your comments it\u2019s seems like you don\u2019t understand telling your wife that you love a pet more than her is a problem. Did you genuinely mean that you love your pets more than your pregnant wife?", "ESH\n\nYou are an AH for obviously saying something asinine and rude. She is an AH for trying to rehome the pets. Pregnancy can make women irritable, but she seems to have a problem with everything.\n\nDid both of you agree to get the pets, or are they just yours?", "NTA\n\nEliminating a hobby, that isn't harmful or dangerous, all because your pregnant wife \"didn't like it\" at the time is pretty sad.  Not sad against you, but sad for you.  Your wife should not have forced that, or became so emotionally distraught that you stopped.  Now, she's doing the same thing with your pets.  She needs to seek help from a doctor.  This isn't normal, and it is going to effect your relationship.", "ESH.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said what you said, for about a million reasons, not least because it just feeds her anger at the pets. \n\nOTOH, there are pregnancy hormones and then there\u2019s just being an animal-abusing asshole. Letting the dog outside is so basic it\u2019s beyond basic. What is going on with her???\n\nIf you rehome the pets, she\u2019ll find something else to latch onto.\n\nHas she considered some kind of therapy? If there\u2019s such a thing as pre-partum depression, and I suspect there is, it sounds like she might have it?\n\nETA: You might want to consider taking the dog to doggie daycare a couple of days a week until she\u2019s moved onto the next complaint. I feel bad for your dog and who knows what\u2019s really going on when you\u2019re not there to see it.", "ESH. \n\nYou for saying that, her for trying to make you get rid of your pets. The solution? She gets over herself, and you apologize profusely.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like your wife is struggling and taking her irritability out on you which is unfair.\n\nBut c'mon, you seriously told your pregnant wife you care more about your pets than her. That is an awful thing to say to somebody you are supposed to love and want to spend the rest of your life with. There are many different ways you could have dealt with this situation and you chose the one that would cause your wife pain. Honestly, I would find that hard to forgive.", "NTA at all. She is being ridiculous. In my opinion pregnancy is not an excuse. Here is a quote. Also just google are dogs good for babies health and show her results.\n\n\u201cGrowing evidence also suggests that exposure to household pets, particularly dogs, during pregnancy and infancy may increase immunity and help lower the baby's risk of health problems such as allergies and asthma\u201d", "NTA, but I'm really worried about your pets. I'm worried you're going to come home one day and they will be gone because she decides to drop them at a shelter or worse,  just out on the side of the road.  Make sure they are chipped and maybe have trackers in their collars or something.  I think you need to let her know if she dies something like this it is a deal breaker.  Good luck.", "NTA - personally I couldn't comprehend being with anyone who would not love my pets as much as I do.  You have chosen to care for them and to rehome them after years would be heartbreaking (for both you and them) and should not be done unless it is in their best interests, not on a selfish whim.\n\nThe fact that your wife only occasionally feeds them indicates she is not an animal lover and it seems like she is using her pregnancy as an excuse to get rid of them, something she couldn't do without looking like a total b prior to this.\n\nAdditionally she needs to think of the damage this would do to your 3 year old, as they would be too young to comprehend the situation but old enough to  feel the pain of their beloved pets being taken away.", "NTA. Sounds like your wife is having a hard time coping with her new responsibilities and has decided to scapegoat the dog because she can't re-home your child. Stop having kids, get the wife in therapy, and maybe get a dog walker to make sure your wife isn't neglecting the poor dog.", "Wait, so you are at work away from home, she is home, she gets annoyed at the dog but refuses to do the simplest thing as open up the door to let it outside so she would, y\u2019a know, be less annoyed? Then gets mad at you? How asinine. This is a complete power play and manipulation. Good Lordt. I\u2019d love her less too. I\u2019m not giving a judgment because she FA and FO. She\u2019s an AH.", "ESH. She is being unreasonable. You both made a commitment to these animals and they have done nothing to warrant rehoming them. However, you shouldn\u2019t have snapped at your emotional pregnant wife that you don\u2019t love her as much - you owe her an apology and an honest conversation.", "INFO: Did she want animals in the first place, or are you the pet person? The phrase \"she doesn't like it that much\" in reference to ALL animal care seems... odd. Also, what is the division of childcare labor like with your 3-year-old between you two?", "ESH. She's being unreasonable wanting to get rid of the pets that she committed to on a whim and not taking any responsibility for them - she can't let the dog out and instead wants you to come home from work to do it?\n\nBut what you said was hurtful and mean.", "**YTA** for what you said. I know it was said in anger, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to forget if my husband said that. \n\nI have a cat that I love, but not more than I love my humans. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m in favor of rehoming your pets, and your anger got the best of you, but it was still an asshole thing to say.", "YTA. How do you expect to make a comeback from that statement?", "Yta. Dude, listen to how you talk about your wife. Not even how you talk to her... how you talk about her. Total ah.", "ESH\n\nShe is your wife. She is the person YOU chose to commit to for the rest of your days. She's also the person growing your child in her body. She should be immensely more important than your pets. \n\nWith that said, pregnancy hormones hit on another level, and it's something you have to learn to cope with when your body has been taken over by a tiny alien. She does need to learn to cope better, and recognize when the pregnancy crazy hits.", "YTA-some words you never forget and you try to make up for it but the damage is done.", "Soft YTA. Your wife is being unreasonable, she accepted the pets before and can't just jettison them now they're settled with you. Unless she's been put on bed rest, letting them out and feeding them is well within her capabilities. She manages OK with your first child, doesn't she? Pets are far less demanding! \n\nHowever, you made the fatal mistake of agreeing that you love them more than her. Oops. That was an AH comment, especially while pregnant. I suggest you backtrack on that and say that you're sorry, you were tired, but you love the animals as part of your family and unless they're harming the kids, they're for life.", "NTA", "ESH. What you said was pretty inexcusable frankly. But also she is being pretty outrageous in her demands. Her irritability seems a little outside the norm - is she getting any mental health care or support? If not, maybe something to consider for a conversation when you\u2019re both in a positive and calm space, from the perspective of she\u2019s feeling unsupported and unhappy and you want to make sure she\u2019s getting what she needs (*not* something thrown out as some sort of attack during a fight)", "NTA\n\nYour wife is using emotional blackmail and weaponized incompetence to get her own way rather than just dealing with pregnancy hormones.\n\nPregnancy can be a hellacious ride but far too many women give the rest of us a bad name when they turn into absolute psychopaths and then shrug and giggle, \u201cthe baby, you know?\u201d No, I fucking don\u2019t know. \n\nThey\u2019re pregnant, like thousands of other women before and after them. They aren\u2019t \u201ckweens.\" They aren\u2019t goddesses. They don\u2019t belong on a pedestal for having not used a condom. Their bodies are performing a biological function.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That means they don\u2019t get their own way 24/7. That means she can open a fucking door if the dog needs to go potty, unless she\u2019s missing hands, which you haven\u2019t mentioned.\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t have fed into her hyperbole, but emotional abusers are brilliant at laying traps like that. I\u2019d give her a heads up that if anything should happen to the pets, you\u2019ll be reporting her to the police for animal neglect and abandonment.", "NTA Normal people don't get rid of their pets. It's a lifetime commitment. She's not behaving like she's in her right mind. I think if  you got rid of the pets, it will be on to the next thing she's unhappy with. I hope she can get help because it's hard to live with someone that is the way you described.", "YTA- but your wife does need to be more reasonable. Listen I was pregnant before and still had to take care of things inside the house. Your wife needs to help out, unless he is on bedrest.", "ESH I get why you snapped and said it, but it wasn't good. I HAVE told my husband that he creates more drama and stress than our pets ever have.\n\nHave you considered a dog door, since your yard is fenced? We have one and love it.", "ESH. \n\nI\u2019m writing this as a pregnant woman so I can see her point in some instances that I\u2019ll explain, however no one here is dealing with this appropriately. \n\nThe two problems I see on your side are that you wanted and now have a dog that isn\u2019t trained. It\u2019s barking enough for your wife to get irritated and (I\u2019m assuming) the dog wasn\u2019t her choice therefore isn\u2019t her responsibility to train. Your second mistake was saying, to your pregnant wife, that you love the pets more than her. She\u2019s the mother of your child going through a whirlwind of hormones, pain, anxiety, literally one of the most difficult things she\u2019ll do in life is being pregnant and you decided to say something like that to her while she\u2019s going through it. Not only pregnancy but being pregnant while taking care of your other child. Not a great look my dude, she deserves an apology. \n\nOn her end she shouldn\u2019t be worried about the dog/cat and allergies. There are studies that show if newborns are brought into a house with pets they have a lower chance at developing allergies and asthma later on in life due to the microbes on their fur. However she shouldn\u2019t be expected to take care of the litter box while she\u2019s pregnant as she can get really sick, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case at your home anyway.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t bring up rehoming the pets out of stress, it clearly is just going to spark an argument and lead nowhere. She\u2019s right about not *needing* to walk the dog as it\u2019s your dog and not her responsibility, and if she\u2019s busy with your other kid and being a SAHM I can see how she doesn\u2019t have time for that. Maybe you can walk the dog before work? Find activities she can do with the dog and baby inside that tires the dog out but doesn\u2019t require her to go out of her way for it.", "YTA, maybe ESH\n\nWho wanted to have the pets? Was it your idea or was she committed to get them? Animals need care, like children. If you are not able to care for them, yes then it's maybe better to re-home them.\n\nShe has to take care for 2 kids. She doesn't have enough energy to take care for the pets.\n\nMaybe you are both AH because you got pets without taking into account that you don't have enough time for them in the longterm. Don't get pets and then complain you can't take care of them after a few years. \n\nSo you have less options. Your wife hates the pets and wants to get rid of them. This sounds harsh now, but it's your decision if you will stay with your wife without the pets - or with the pets in a new home withour your wife.", "ESH. Ur wife is being unreasonable and is an AH for that. U r also a huge AH for saying that u cared for ur pets more than her", "YTA. How can pets be even near as important as your wife? I just don't get it, it seems like you don't care much about her or what she wants or thinks. What you said to her was completely out of line. Your comment that you think she's ridiculous is very disrespectful. I think your point of view is ridiculous, but normally I wouldn't say it to you in those words.", "NTA. If someone gets into an argument with you and tries to emotionally blackmail you by claiming that you love someone or something than them because you disagree about how to handle something, responding sarcastically in the affirmative is a totally acceptable response. \n\nDoesn't make you a prince. But it doesn't make you an asshole either. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "ESH \n\nYou for snapping at pregnant wife and saying you care more for the pets.  Even if it was true in that moment.\n\nHer She sounds like a \u2018now that I have kids I don\u2019t need a pet\u2019 who considers pets as temporary replacements for kids.  Pets are a lifetime obligation (theirs or yours).  You don\u2019t dump a pet anymore easily than you would dump a child.", "Yta.", "Wow. Mega fail. This one will follow you for the rest of your pre-divorce life. And she'll never get over hating the pets because of what you said. \nYta, not for wanting to keep your pets, but for what you said.", "Yes, YTA. I find it disturbing that you actually not only said it, but you have double it down in the comments. Your wife is undergoing a lot of changes during pregnancy and things are hard for her, and you don\u2019t seem to empathize with her problems. Of course I don\u2019t believe that you should rehome your pets, but given how you put it, if I was your wife I would leave you, because I wouldn\u2019t stay in a relationship where pets were more important than me, especially while pregnant. \n\nYou escalated the discussion and I don\u2019t see now how you can de escalate it without showing her that she is more important. You could have dealt with the situation calmly and try to make further concessions and show her that the pets are important too, but she was your priority. Now I don\u2019t see a good solution anymore", "I'm so sorry her pregnancy is difficult for you /s.\n\nYTA.", "ESH\nThe yard is fenced in.

C\u2019mon now.\n\nAs someone who has gone through it, she is giving me antenatal depression/anxiety vibes. Unless she has never liked the pets, her behavior is out of the ordinary and irrational.

I don\u2019t think some people realise how things like pregnancy and even periods/menopause to a certain extent can completely mess with a woman\u2019s mood and mental state.

That's sick. FYI I'm also pregnant and get irritated with stuff and certainly not suggesting that my husband get rid of our dog or stop gaming.", "This is hilarious. You keep saying it\u2019s just her hormones but now you\u2019re saying she\u2019s gonna leave op because of him agreeing with her comment after pushing him for weeks. I just can\u2019t. The wife is being 1000% unreasonable and she\u2019s the ah", "Stop acting like your only two options were to re-home the pets or tell her you care more about them than her.\n\nI am not saying your wife is innocent in all of this but she is obviously struggling at the moment and acting irrationally, telling somebody in this position that they are cared for less than animals is obviously going to make things worse.\n\nInstead you could have told her that of course you love and care for her more than the pets but that you feel what she is asking is unfair and not something you are prepared to do, love is not about blindly following orders from a spouse but working together. You could explain how her actions are making you feel and that It would be better if you could both work towards a solution you can both agree to but if not, perhaps couples therapy is needed to help you work through these issues.\n\nGoing for the most hurtful option is never a good idea OP and I think you know that.", "She seems overly stressed if she\u2019s telling you she\u2019s unable to open a door for the dog. Clearly there\u2019s a communication problem if this is how it\u2019s being played out. I know you can develop something like PPD/PPA but prenatal, id do some research and make sure she isn\u2019t showing symptoms.", "So why not put a doggie door in?  Yes it would be easier for her to just open the door but she won\u2019t so at this point the dog is suffering unnecessarily.", "Then you are no AH. I wouldn't do any actions during her hormonal phase. \n\nMaybe I am too biased there. There animals I love and animals that can be annoying.", "She accepted because you pushed her I'm sure. Rehoming is not throwing away. If she would want to throw them away then she would be TA. But your standpoint makes it clear again that she's not very important to you. YTA.\n\nEdit: You also already made up your mind that you're NTA. It seems like you just want to hear that from other people.", "\u201cSo why are you seeking therapy?\u201d\n\u201cI told my pregnant wife I love our pets more than I love her.\u201d\nYTA", "Or hire a pet sitter to come by once or twice a day to take care of the pets.", "Why should op get rid of the pets when you agree the wife is being unreasonable. She doesn\u2019t even have to do anything for them! She just decided she hates them and they have to leave. After that what\u2019s next? Telling op to just figure out how to pay for this extra nonsense is rude of you. Seems he\u2019s the only working person in this home with one kid and another on the way.", "Everyone is crucifying this guy for snapping because his wife told him to get rid of their pets. Therefore you\u2019re basically saying it\u2019s ok for her to get rid of their pets because she is pregnant. I\u2019m not even anything close to resembling an animal rights activist it is just common decency and responsibility. You take on a responsibility when you adopt pets and you cant just throw them away because you don\u2019t want them anymore. I don\u2019t think op is an ah becuase he said something regrettable when faced with having to get rid of his pets that he loves.", "Your comment was \u201ckill the pets\u201d. That\u2019s extreme. I didn\u2019t give her a free pass. I said she was acting like a soft AH but pregnancy hormones absolutely play a part. The question here was whether OP was an AH for saying he loves his animals more than his wife. Yes, he\u2019s an AH for saying that he loves his animals more than his wife, the mother of his children.", "I 100% said that she was being an AH. I suggested to OP to meet her in the middle and get a dog walker (as other posters have also later suggested and no one has downvoted them) and he jumped down my throat, (\u201cWHOS GOING TO PAY FOR THE DOG WALKER?\u201d Sorry man, just trying to help) which made me change my mind into thinking that he is even a bigger AH than I even originally thought. Yes, she is ridiculous for wanting to just rehome the pets but pregnancy hormones can do crazy things and that was my argument to the person that kept telling me that she was going to MURDER the animals.", "It's not that she's unable to do it, she just doesn't want to", "They adopted a dog together. And no she does NOT get a free pass to get rid of her husbands cats or the dog SHE adopted for no reason. This is why shelters are full of animals because of extreme selfishness. Pets are family not accessories you can dump whenever it doesn\u2019t suit you anymore. You ever try tehomjng an older cat!?? Nearly impossible. I hate when people say oh just rehome! Where? To who? Dumped at a shelter and euthanized because he\u2019s married to an a selfish and unreasonable person.", "I didn't kidnapped her, we agreed to move in together, we agreed to have pets, we agreed to get married and we agreed to have kids. I didn't pressure her about anything because she knew well that I had pets that I cared about, if she hag already decided she didn't want any pets than I was not a good partner for her, but she decided otherwise.  \n\nRehoming a pet that you had for years it's cruel to them, they don't understand why are you doing that and they feel abandoned. You can't explain a cat or dog that your wife suddenly doesn't like pets anymore, they won't understand. It's cruel and I sincerely hope you never have pets if that's how you're gonna look after them.", "What, he pushed her to marry him knowing he had cats?", "That's conveniently omitting literally years of context but go off", "You only read the title didn't you?", "That's not even close to what I said. You clearly didn't even bother to read my comment. I said that he's TA because he's not LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. A doggie daycare is a solution. A dog walker is a solution. You know what I never claimed was a solution? Ditching the animals.", "Her pregnancy is a temporary thing. He said she was irritable in her first trimester in her first pregnancy and then she was less irritable afterwards. So he knows this will pass. He\u2019s TA.", "Sorry but if she\u2019s so screwed up with hormones she wants to get rid of her pets than killing then in some way weather by driving them to  an abandoned lot and dumping them or something more violent isn\u2019t that extreme. Sorry. Op said something stupid he should apologize for, but he was pushed up against the wall and said something stupid. You\u2019re so holier than thou that you never said something you regret? You don\u2019t know what those cats meant to him before his marriage and she is so cruel and heartless (don\u2019t talk to me again about hormones please) that she doesn\u2019t care about how much it would hurt her husband to get rid of them?", "That\u2019s my point. Unable as in shes not letting herself choose what seems to be the easiest option.", "Some people just seem to not care about pets enough. This is why shelter should make sure that someone is responsible enough to adopt a pet.", "I agree that if they can't rehome to a good home they have to keep them. That's what I already said before. I'm very strongly doubting that she wanted the pets before to be honest. Pressure can come in many ways.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019d say if I was the wife. If I said anything in his presence ever again.", "I read the whole thing unfortunately.", "It\u2019s not a solution if they can\u2019t afford it.", "But she is the one who doesn\u2019t want a solution by saying that they should be rehomed? She doesn\u2019t want a dog walker she doesn\u2019t want solutions she wants them gone. At least according to what op said anyway.", "For the sake of op and the pets I hope this is correct that she doesn\u2019t really want to rehome them and was irritable. we don\u2019t know them and we don\u2019t know how serious she was about wanting to get rid of the pets but the fact that she can see an animal in some distress (have to go to the bathroom) and refuses to open the door to let the dog out is telling that she doesn\u2019t care about these animals and she is serious. But I hope I\u2019m wrong", "https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4458.epdf?sharing_token=xkZ5DqM-G1VJWp9q0oJhSNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OoX6OSHJp2hQIV-DChXj5HOoHXvo6VsVpQ8bmMkS8JOvJtTBGK7OHiKO_086aHb8WBIEU5apqO6gd8QkL-TXBUssEb4p7RrJB9Vc7BAduOMVz7NmsRIfM-ZvSpeBCVpAcv5pTVqR3ANvaQFsZsCAz9SHK7w3sxR0l6GqcAMMSCwg%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.livescience.com\n\nAn article/study that will tell you that pregnancy literally changes a women\u2019s brain. That doesn\u2019t even account for the hormonal changes that also occur during and after pregnancy. Educate yourself before making blanket statements that everyone is giving pregnant women free passes for their behavior.", "For what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH and I\u2019m sorry if you lose your beloved cats. I had my cat before marriage and my husband loves him and accepts him as his own. We know the realities of what happens to cats if there is not a good home lined up for them, and it is not good. Sure you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said but I can imagine how helpless you feel when the person you married disregards how you feel about your pets.", "NTA. But I think some therapy would benefit your wife.", "Then don\u2019t marry a man who has cats or discuss it before marriage: Tough shit. She gets no free pass for these antics from me. I\u2019m grateful my husband loves my cat as much as sometimes I think even more than I do. Everyone is latching on to this stupid hurtful thing he said and while of course it\u2019s not nice to say these things and he should apologize I also thing people say things they don\u2019t mean out of anger and being pushed up against a wall, like he was.", "What would you say? I don't understand what you mean.", "I hope the OP doesn\u2019t literally love his pets more than his pregnant wife. I\u2019d be preparing to move out if my husband said that and did not immediately apologize.", "You make really great points and more than likely the wife should seek professional help but I understand why some people will find it hard to let things slide. Being the mother of 5, no two pregnancies are the same. When I found myself getting irritated over mundane things then I would remove myself from the equation and take a drive or walk to clear my head and find my peace again. Maybe OP should suggest that to his wife. I think it's unfair to use hormonal imbalance for everything.", "Doesn\u2019t give a free pass for dumping animals. Sorry. I don\u2019t care. Plus she has been pregnant before and this is a new thing.", "Yeah. So, brain changes happen. But to not seek any sort of therapy or help to manage things and just expect everyone to give into your demands is wrong.", "Not just one thing and not just hurtful but also disrespectful. That's why I think she's not very important to him. I agree that they seem to be a bad match and didn't discuss enough before marriage. But I also doubt that this guy is open for discussion.", "I hope everybody who is latching into one stupid thing he said because his wife wants to harm and throw away his beloved pets has never said anything hurtful out of anger and desperation. Almost as if life is more nuanced than one stupid thing somebody said.", "No one has dumped any animals!!!! She asked him to rehome them. And my suggestion was to meet her in the middle and have someone come oved and help out with the animals.  Every pregnancy is different and changes a woman\u2019s body differently each time. Hormone levels are different.", "[removed]"]}
