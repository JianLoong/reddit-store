With our first baby she claimed she hated videogames so I just stopped playing videogames until after our daughter was born. This time however she's getting irritated about the pets. She says the dog barks and makes her head ache, I told her to just let it go outside if the weather is nice but she said that pets are my responsibility so she won't do that. Well what else can she do? I am working so I can't go home and let the dog out whenever she feels like it. She then complained because she opened a can of \"fish\" the other day and it turned out to be cat's food, suddenly I was the one to blame again although she made the mistake. She also started talking about how cats or dogs fur can be dangerous for the baby or herself. This has been going on for weeks, every day she has a new complain when I get home. \n\nA few days ago she finally suggested the great idea of finding the cats and the dog a new house because she can't put up with them anymore. I try to just let it go because I know she's irritated but she just won't drop it. Yesterday we were having an argument because I had to stay an extra hour and half in work so I was late for walking the dog and it was barking a lot (according to her), I'm pretty tired of it by now so I'm getting angry at her, she told me again to get rid of the pets but this time I snapped at her. Our argument got worse, she told me I cared more about the pets than about her and I told her she was right. \n\nShe never had a health complication related to the pets and they were with us before our first pregnancy. I think she's ridiculous and she's trying to get me to be angry and start an argument. I know what I said wasn't ideal but what else she wanted me to say?

She needs to learn coping techniques that don\u2019t involve just eliminating whatever annoys her.  You just fully giving up your gaming hobby during her first pregnancy was very generous and considerate.  It\u2019s cruel to try to get rid of your pets the same way she stopped you gaming.  I\u2019m betting that your generosity in the first situation is part of why she expects to get rid of the pets - you bent over backwards for her before, so she expects you to again.\n\nShe needs to understand that temporarily giving up some of your electronics is not remotely the same as giving up family members, and your pets are family to you. NTA", "NTA. I understand hormones and pregnancy can change her brain. It still isn\u2019t an excuse to expect you to cruelly rehome your animals. Yes, you prob shouldn\u2019t have said you love them more, but she\u2019s the bigger AH in this situation. And you both need therapy.", "I have been pregnant four times and I have gotten so cranky\u2026 pets are family. She is using the pregnancy as an excuse to get rid of them. The only thing that she can be around is the litter box.

Your wife needs some support and she needs to work through whatever it is she is dealing with. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. I am firmly on the side that pets are forever when you bring them into your home.

I don't think pregnancy has anything to do with it...she's just being a controlling asshole because she thinks she can bully you into it and use pregnancy as an excuse.", "First of all, I\u2019d get an inside camera to see if the dog actually barks a lot. The answer to that question wouldn\u2019t influence my actions but I would want to know the truth. And you don\u2019t rehome pets , let alone when you are pregnant with temporary crazy hormones. I would be absolutely irate with her. And honestly, pets give unconditional love - they aren\u2019t complaining about your wife and her whining and expecting you to choose between them so I get why you answered the way you did.", "NTA. You\u2019re human. You snapped. It happens. Apologize. Explain she had just pushed too far and you were tired and snapped. You\u2019re adults. People act like they never snapped before or said something stupid.", "NTA\n\nI like how everyone is sticking up for your wife and painting she's a saint and you're the villain I mean what else could I expect from this thread? \n\nYou always look after your pets\n\nShe doesn't do anything for them apart from feed them every so often\n\nShe wanted the pets as much as you hence why you got a dog together but she doesn't do anything for it?\n\nIt seems to me, she's literally focusing on anything you like or do. She literally made you stop playing video games while she was pregnant, she now wants you to get rid of your pets all I'm saying is if these roles were reversed you would be dubbed TA straight away because you are a man and she would be told red flags, run away and everything else this thread normally says. She needs help and therapy. Why is her major negative focus on you and everything around you and while she's pregnant?", "INFO: from your comments it\u2019s seems like you don\u2019t understand telling your wife that you love a pet more than her is a problem. Did you genuinely mean that you love your pets more than your pregnant wife?\n\nEdit: you seem to be responding to everyone but me because this is hard to acknowledge. I can\u2019t imagine having a child with someone I loved less than my pet. But some of us don\u2019t want to bring children into irresponsible situations.", "ESH\n\nYou are an AH for obviously saying something asinine and rude. She is an AH for trying to rehome the pets.

Not sad against you, but sad for you.  Your wife should not have forced that, or became so emotionally distraught that you stopped.  Now, she's doing the same thing with your pets.  She needs to seek help from a doctor.  This isn't normal, and it is going to effect your relationship.", "ESH.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said what you said, for about a million reasons, not least because it just feeds her anger at the pets. \n\nOTOH, there are pregnancy hormones and then there\u2019s just being an animal-abusing asshole. Letting the dog outside is so basic it\u2019s beyond basic. What is going on with her???\n\nIf you rehome the pets, she\u2019ll find something else to latch onto.\n\nHas she considered some kind of therapy? If there\u2019s such a thing as pre-partum depression, and I suspect there is, it sounds like she might have it?\n\nETA: You might want to consider taking the dog to doggie daycare a couple of days a week until she\u2019s moved onto the next complaint. I feel bad for your dog and who knows what\u2019s really going on when you\u2019re not there to see it.", "ESH. \n\nYou for saying that, her for trying to make you get rid of your pets. The solution? She gets over herself, and you apologize profusely.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like your wife is struggling and taking her irritability out on you which is unfair.\n\nBut c'mon, you seriously told your pregnant wife you care more about your pets than her. That is an awful thing to say to somebody you are supposed to love and want to spend the rest of your life with. There are many different ways you could have dealt with this situation and you chose the one that would cause your wife pain. Honestly, I would find that hard to forgive.", "NTA at all. She is being ridiculous. In my opinion pregnancy is not an excuse. Here is a quote. Also just google are dogs good for babies health and show her results.\n\n\u201cGrowing evidence also suggests that exposure to household pets, particularly dogs, during pregnancy and infancy may increase immunity and help lower the baby's risk of health problems such as allergies and asthma\u201d", "NTA, but I'm really worried about your pets. I'm worried you're going to come home one day and they will be gone because she decides to drop them at a shelter or worse,  just out on the side of the road.  Make sure they are chipped and maybe have trackers in their collars or something.  I think you need to let her know if she dies something like this it is a deal breaker.  Good luck.", "NTA - personally I couldn't comprehend being with anyone who would not love my pets as much as I do.  You have chosen to care for them and to rehome them after years would be heartbreaking (for both you and them) and should not be done unless it is in their best interests, not on a selfish whim.\n\nThe fact that your wife only occasionally feeds them indicates she is not an animal lover and it seems like she is using her pregnancy as an excuse to get rid of them, something she couldn't do without looking like a total b prior to this.\n\nAdditionally she needs to think of the damage this would do to your 3 year old, as they would be too young to comprehend the situation but old enough to  feel the pain of their beloved pets being taken away.", "NTA. Sounds like your wife is having a hard time coping with her new responsibilities and has decided to scapegoat the dog because she can't re-home your child. Stop having kids, get the wife in therapy, and maybe get a dog walker to make sure your wife isn't neglecting the poor dog.", "Wait, so you are at work away from home, she is home, she gets annoyed at the dog but refuses to do the simplest thing as open up the door to let it outside so she would, y\u2019a know, be less annoyed? Then gets mad at you? How asinine. This is a complete power play and manipulation. Good Lordt. I\u2019d love her less too. I\u2019m not giving a judgment because she FA and FO. She\u2019s an AH.", "ESH. She is being unreasonable. You both made a commitment to these animals and they have done nothing to warrant rehoming them. However, you shouldn\u2019t have snapped at your emotional pregnant wife that you don\u2019t love her as much - you owe her an apology and an honest conversation.", "INFO: Did she want animals in the first place, or are you the pet person? The phrase \"she doesn't like it that much\" in reference to ALL animal care seems... odd. Also, what is the division of childcare labor like with your 3-year-old between you two?", "ESH. She's being unreasonable wanting to get rid of the pets that she committed to on a whim and not taking any responsibility for them - she can't let the dog out and instead wants you to come home from work to do it?\n\nBut what you said was hurtful and mean.", "**YTA** for what you said. I know it was said in anger, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to forget if my husband said that. \n\nI have a cat that I love, but not more than I love my humans. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m in favor of rehoming your pets, and your anger got the best of you, but it was still an asshole thing to say.", "YTA. How do you expect to make a comeback from that statement?", "Yta. Dude, listen to how you talk about your wife. Not even how you talk to her... how you talk about her. Total ah.", "ESH\n\nShe is your wife. She is the person YOU chose to commit to for the rest of your days. She's also the person growing your child in her body. She should be immensely more important than your pets. \n\nWith that said, pregnancy hormones hit on another level, and it's something you have to learn to cope with when your body has been taken over by a tiny alien. She does need to learn to cope better, and recognize when the pregnancy crazy hits.", "YTA-some words you never forget and you try to make up for it but the damage is done.", "Soft YTA. Your wife is being unreasonable, she accepted the pets before and can't just jettison them now they're settled with you. Unless she's been put on bed rest, letting them out and feeding them is well within her capabilities. She manages OK with your first child, doesn't she? Pets are far less demanding! \n\nHowever, you made the fatal mistake of agreeing that you love them more than her. Oops. That was an AH comment, especially while pregnant. I suggest you backtrack on that and say that you're sorry, you were tired, but you love the animals as part of your family and unless they're harming the kids, they're for life.", "NTA", "ESH. What you said was pretty inexcusable frankly. But also she is being pretty outrageous in her demands. Her irritability seems a little outside the norm - is she getting any mental health care or support? If not, maybe something to consider for a conversation when you\u2019re both in a positive and calm space, from the perspective of she\u2019s feeling unsupported and unhappy and you want to make sure she\u2019s getting what she needs (*not* something thrown out as some sort of attack during a fight)", "NTA\n\nYour wife is using emotional blackmail and weaponized incompetence to get her own way rather than just dealing with pregnancy hormones.\n\nPregnancy can be a hellacious ride but far too many women give the rest of us a bad name when they turn into absolute psychopaths and then shrug and giggle, \u201cthe baby, you know?\u201d No, I fucking don\u2019t know. \n\nThey\u2019re pregnant, like thousands of other women before and after them. They aren\u2019t \u201ckweens.\" They aren\u2019t goddesses. They don\u2019t belong on a pedestal for having not used a condom. Their bodies are performing a biological function.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That means they don\u2019t get their own way 24/7. That means she can open a fucking door if the dog needs to go potty, unless she\u2019s missing hands, which you haven\u2019t mentioned.\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t have fed into her hyperbole, but emotional abusers are brilliant at laying traps like that. I\u2019d give her a heads up that if anything should happen to the pets, you\u2019ll be reporting her to the police for animal neglect and abandonment.", "NTA Normal people don't get rid of their pets. It's a lifetime commitment. She's not behaving like she's in her right mind. I think if  you got rid of the pets, it will be on to the next thing she's unhappy with. I hope she can get help because it's hard to live with someone that is the way you described.", "YTA- but your wife does need to be more reasonable. Listen I was pregnant before and still had to take care of things inside the house. Your wife needs to help out, unless he is on bedrest.", "ESH I get why you snapped and said it, but it wasn't good. I HAVE told my husband that he creates more drama and stress than our pets ever have.\n\nHave you considered a dog door, since your yard is fenced? We have one and love it.", "ESH. \n\nI\u2019m writing this as a pregnant woman so I can see her point in some instances that I\u2019ll explain, however no one here is dealing with this appropriately. \n\nThe two problems I see on your side are that you wanted and now have a dog that isn\u2019t trained. It\u2019s barking enough for your wife to get irritated and (I\u2019m assuming) the dog wasn\u2019t her choice therefore isn\u2019t her responsibility to train. Your second mistake was saying, to your pregnant wife, that you love the pets more than her. She\u2019s the mother of your child going through a whirlwind of hormones, pain, anxiety, literally one of the most difficult things she\u2019ll do in life is being pregnant and you decided to say something like that to her while she\u2019s going through it. Not only pregnancy but being pregnant while taking care of your other child. Not a great look my dude, she deserves an apology. \n\nOn her end she shouldn\u2019t be worried about the dog/cat and allergies. There are studies that show if newborns are brought into a house with pets they have a lower chance at developing allergies and asthma later on in life due to the microbes on their fur. However she shouldn\u2019t be expected to take care of the litter box while she\u2019s pregnant as she can get really sick, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case at your home anyway.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t bring up rehoming the pets out of stress, it clearly is just going to spark an argument and lead nowhere. She\u2019s right about not *needing* to walk the dog as it\u2019s your dog and not her responsibility, and if she\u2019s busy with your other kid and being a SAHM I can see how she doesn\u2019t have time for that. Maybe you can walk the dog before work? Find activities she can do with the dog and baby inside that tires the dog out but doesn\u2019t require her to go out of her way for it.", "YTA, maybe ESH\n\nWho wanted to have the pets? Was it your idea or was she committed to get them? Animals need care, like children. If you are not able to care for them, yes then it's maybe better to re-home them.\n\nShe has to take care for 2 kids. She doesn't have enough energy to take care for the pets.\n\nMaybe you are both AH because you got pets without taking into account that you don't have enough time for them in the longterm. Don't get pets and then complain you can't take care of them after a few years. \n\nSo you have less options. Your wife hates the pets and wants to get rid of them. This sounds harsh now, but it's your decision if you will stay with your wife without the pets - or with the pets in a new home withour your wife.", "ESH. Ur wife is being unreasonable and is an AH for that. U r also a huge AH for saying that u cared for ur pets more than her", "YTA. How can pets be even near as important as your wife? I just don't get it, it seems like you don't care much about her or what she wants or thinks. What you said to her was completely out of line. Your comment that you think she's ridiculous is very disrespectful. I think your point of view is ridiculous, but normally I wouldn't say it to you in those words.", "NTA. If someone gets into an argument with you and tries to emotionally blackmail you by claiming that you love someone or something than them because you disagree about how to handle something, responding sarcastically in the affirmative is a totally acceptable response. \n\nDoesn't make you a prince. But it doesn't make you an asshole either. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "ESH \n\nYou for snapping at pregnant wife and saying you care more for the pets.  Even if it was true in that moment.\n\nHer She sounds like a \u2018now that I have kids I don\u2019t need a pet\u2019 who considers pets as temporary replacements for kids.  Pets are a lifetime obligation (theirs or yours).  You don\u2019t dump a pet anymore easily than you would dump a child.", "Yta.", "Wow. Mega fail. This one will follow you for the rest of your pre-divorce life. And she'll never get over hating the pets because of what you said. \nYta, not for wanting to keep your pets, but for what you said.", "Yes, YTA. I find it disturbing that you actually not only said it, but you have double it down in the comments. Your wife is undergoing a lot of changes during pregnancy and things are hard for her, and you don\u2019t seem to empathize with her problems. Of course I don\u2019t believe that you should rehome your pets, but given how you put it, if I was your wife I would leave you, because I wouldn\u2019t stay in a relationship where pets were more important than me, especially while pregnant. \n\nYou escalated the discussion and I don\u2019t see now how you can de escalate it without showing her that she is more important. You could have dealt with the situation calmly and try to make further concessions and show her that the pets are important too, but she was your priority. Now I don\u2019t see a good solution anymore", "I'm so sorry her pregnancy is difficult for you /s.\n\nYTA.", "ESH\nThe yard is fenced in.

I never connected with this dog because we brought him home as a puppy when our second son was six weeks old. Bonding with a dog was the last thing on my radar and it was super stressful to have a puppy, a newborn, and a toddler (plus a 4 year old dog). He was a very sweet dog, but he was constantly getting into trouble, eating furniture, eating food off the counter, destroying things, eating our kids\u2019 clothes that were soiled.

We're living only on my income and if you live in the US you might know how expensive visiting a doctor can be.", "A few people have replied to say that their partners know their pets are more important to them, and I can understand that. But I\u2019m not willing to be in that kind of relationship.", "He said they adopted the dog *together.*", "I'm really trying to figure out how you're coming up with this story you created. You seem very sure since you've commented all over this entire thread.", "I honestly never heard of a person that won\u2019t let a poor dog out to go to the bathroom. So..it has to wait ALL day til this guy gets home??", "If they can afford it and it brings both parties peace of mind, it\u2019s money well spent.\n\nI am a stay at home mom and if we had the money for a part time housekeeper or nanny, i would gladly pay for the help even though I am home all day to do it. I just hate doing dishes and vacuuming, and as much as I love my kids, I would love a break from them sometimes when their father is at work. It would be a ridiculous waste of money but it sure would help me out with something stressing me out.", "Why not?", "I agree.\n\nThose women were and are phenomenal, strong, independent.\n\nA class in and of themselves..", ": Pregnancy is hard. I've been pregnant twice. But letting the dog outside is not the end of the world. The wife is the AH in my opinion.", "But I didn't I was simply responding to to the comment well \"she didn't knock herself up\" which I thought ridiculous.  \n\nI thought it amusing because no one, most especially people on this thread, would \"know\" who \"knocked her up\".\n\nWhat difference to her behavior does it make who \"knocked her up\"?\n\nNo one, her irrational behavior is irrelevant as to who \"knocked her up\"", "Why did he answer in the affirmative if he didn\u2019t mean it? If he meant it, they shouldn\u2019t be married. If he doesn\u2019t mean it, he should apologize.", "I agree it\u2019s the wife\u2019s opinion but that doesn\u2019t make it what they have to do. She\u2019s trying to make permanent solutions to a temporary problem (being her hormones). The pets weren\u2019t a problem before even with her previous pregnancy.", ": it's not hard to take care of 2 kids, a dog, and 2 cats when OP takes care of the animals. It's not hard to open a door a few times a day to let the dog out. Pregnancy is not an excuse to be an awful person.", "He's the asshole for not condoning animal abuse? Yeah, that makes sense.", "Some weirdo love animals more than her children, good for you not pick a fight with them", "A dog walker is cheaper than a divorce. You can get a neighborhood kid to do it for relatively cheap.\n\nI think you just need to have a candid conversation with your wife. Ask her what specific problems she is having with the pets, and try to come up with solutions to them. Tell her up front that you cannot remove them, but that you're going to try to be as accommodating to her as you can. And apologize for saying you love the pets more than you. Unless you do love her less than a dog, in which case that's a whole different conversation", "Thank you, I appreciate that. That response is what you should have said in the first place instead of asking me a rhetorical question that sounded very defensive when I was trying to offer a solution. Your wife is being ridiculous and you said something in the heat of the moment. I don\u2019t know your wife but if she\u2019s not normally like this, you definitely should bring it up to her doctors. (I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be downvoted like crazy for suggesting pregnancy hormones\u2026BUT ITS A THING and can do crazy things to people.)", "So you think the man who dropped an ENTIRE HOBBY for his wife's comfort during pregnancy, was somehow able to peer pressure her into having cats? News flash, the cats were in his life first! \n\nIf I started dating someone and they said It was them or my pets, theyd be long gone. The way you talk about OP strongly suggests you have some personal beef that's not being discussed here.", "The answer is right there in OP\u2019s post. \n\nNo one is actually listening to what he is saying she is saying. \n\nShe has blatantly told him \u201cthe animals are his responsibility\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s clear as day. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s at home or with them, she didn\u2019t agree to that.  She agreed to living with these animals that he loves under the assumption he will caregive for them exclusively.  \n\nIt\u2019s trippy that you all aren\u2019t seeing that from his post and making an assumption that when you marry someone their animals become your own.  They don\u2019t. \n\nThe easiest way to solve this is to know what the agreement was prior to her marrying and moving in with the cats, and adopting the dog.", "Okay but you're talking about actual tasks not literally just opening a door so the dog can go into the backyard.", "There\u2019s a big difference between having a helping hand doing real household tasks that are a little more difficult than paying someone to literally come to your house so the wife can walk what\u2019s probably the same number of steps to the front door rather than the back door, to let someone in to just open the back door for the dog.", "so superior, bless them for showing us how weak the rest of us are. thank them for me please.", "OPs post mentioned the dog going out of the weather is nice. Which is a fairly big if. We also don\u2019t know their living circumstances, are they in a big house with lots of space, or a small place where things are move challenging? Small breed dogs can be snappy and inappropriate to have close to babies or small children. \n\nThere probably are/may be details we aren\u2019t hearing because we are only hearing one side of this. \n\nThe OP has clearly framed this as \u201clook how awful my irrational pregnant wife is\u201d to garner sympathy on the internet", "Point taken. \n\nI went through OPs comments and they have a fenced in backyard so refusing to open the door for a dog to use the bathroom or get some peace is childish. Just open the door. I dont understand why the wife is being like this (yeah she's pregnant but geeze). First it's his gaming consoles and now his dog/cats? What's next? Does she not want OP to be happy? \n\nIdk honestly.", "If you were trying to make me chose, I'd let you.", "Open to discuss what? How his feelings dont matter and he should just rehome his cats to appease his controlling wife? It's been made perfectly clear that this is his only open to make him happy, or to make you satisfied in his \"ability to discuss\". Your just as bad as she is if you think that OP is the real problem here."]}
