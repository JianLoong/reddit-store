Then my husband lied to me to my face about it. \n\nWe moved into a new house a few months ago. I've still had many boxes in my craft room to unpack. My husband has asked me before if I wanted help with the room, and I\u2019ve always said no, because I don't want anyone else messing with my stuff. I didn't have the moving company touch it and I intentionally packed it so that I could re-organize it whenever I unpacked it. It would be more difficult for someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking at to go through and try to do something with my stuff. \ufffc So, my husband decided it would be \"helpful\" to go behind my back and have his mom do it. I noticed it as soon as I got home. I asked him if he had his mom do it. He completely lied to my face and told me he hired an organizing company to come in. It's the most disorganized mess I\u2019ve ever seen. I got suspicious a few days ago whenever it was so poorly organized that there were greeting cards in three different areas of the room. I decided to go through my husband's phone, because he kept saying it was this \"company he found on Facebook.\" I was curious what \"company\" he hired and also wanted to verify if it was really MIL like I suspected. Sure enough, it was his mom. I actually don't know if she just decided to do it, or if he asked her. I\u2019m seriously upset about it, though. \ufffcI don't think I can post SS of their convo, but basically she asked about cameras in our house and was worried I would go back and see it was really her. He said not to worry, I didn't know how to use the cameras (I do). She said to make sure he sticks to the story of it being an organizing company because \"later if you admit it, she'll hold it against me that I lied to her.\" He said not to worry and that he \"would take the fall if she ever finds out.\" \n\nSo who is TA here? \n\nI did go through his phone and got very upset and yelled at my husband about it so WIBTA here?", "created_utc": 1688790797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ttr19/aita_for_being_upset_about_husband_and_mil/", "score": 285, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why? Because I want to ask for a refund due to the crappy job they did.\u201d", "NTA - You should box it all up and then organize it in a place of your own because it\u2019s only going down hill from here unless you take those craft scissors and cut the umbilical cord from his mother. Yikes!", "My question is why was organizing your craft room such a big deal that your husband and MIL when to great lengths to scheme and plot and lie!  That is extremely troublesome and suggests that their effort was not about helping you but something else. You have every right to be upset. Going through his phone was not cool, but a far less concern than him and his mom gaslighting you. Confront him, and if he tries to veer the conversation to you looking through his phone, redirect him and tell him that you can talk about his concern once you are done talking about your concern. My gut is unsettled with this one and I hope it all works out well for you.", "NTA. That is such a violation of your space and your clearly stated wishes for your craft supplies. I have to wonder why your husband did this when he knew it was not what you wanted. His lying is a problem, but even if he really had hired someone to do this, it was still wrong to interfere with your plans and your things.", "NTA. I\u2019d be far more angry that he\u2019s a complete liar than the fact that he and his mother conspired to dig through your stuff against your will. This doesn\u2019t bode well for either relationship.", "NTA, but I see so many red flags that I have questions:\n\n1) You moved into this new place. Is this closer to your MIL than where you lived before?\n\n2) Has your MIL complained about your organization skills/issues in the past?\n\n3) Has your husband lied to you in the past, and if so, about what issues/events? Has he always treated you like this? \n\n4) How large is his family? Does he have siblings with spouses? If so, has she done anything like this to them? \n\n5) How long have you and your husband known each other? How long have you both been married?", "NTA\n\nIf they didn't think they were in the wrong, why did they lie about who did it?", "NTA, they lied. Hope nothing is missing.", "INFO:  Did you check the cameras?  Who else did she bring with her - one of your husband\u2019s siblings or sisters-in-law?  I\u2019m sorry you are finding things missing.  \n\nWhat else does he lie about?  Money?  Sex?  Gambling?  Yikes.", "NTA. Getting his mother to do this was a major breach of trust. Lying about it is worse. Planning to lie about it before the event is unforgivable. I would never be able to trust either of them again.", "NTA, why would your husband disrespect you like that? Doesn't he care about your wants and feelings? To me this is a bigger issue than the craft room. So yes, you should be upset and he should grovel. And mil needs a time out.", "NTA but why was your husband so concerned about your room. Was it in a common area. \n\nAnd does he know you have the text messages between him and his mom", "NTA. I would be so furious if that happened to me. Would he like it if your mother organised his tools/ models/ music catalogue?", "OP, you're NTA but the level of disrespect shown by your husband and MIL is horrifying. I could not tolerate living with someone who goes behind my back to get their own way and then lies to my face about it. I would ordinarily suggest therapy but in this case it would be too late for me. Good luck.", "INFO: Have you left anything else unpacked or is just your personal space? Also, do you talk about getting to it regularly but never actually do?\n\nI ask this because my wife didn't unpack some of her stuff for a year after we moved and it drove me fucking crazy to still have boxes in the corner of every room. I eventually just dragged it all down to the garage a few months ago so that we could actually enjoy the space in our house and so it would look presentable when guests came out (something that she constantly stressed about but never took care of). Those boxes are still untouched in the garage and I guarantee you they would have still been untouched inside the house.", "ESH - He and his mother suck for violating your trust and organizing the room.
