Then my husband lied to me to my face about it. \n\nWe moved into a new house a few months ago. I've still had many boxes in my craft room to unpack. My husband has asked me before if I wanted help with the room, and I\u2019ve always said no, because I don't want anyone else messing with my stuff. I didn't have the moving company touch it and I intentionally packed it so that I could re-organize it whenever I unpacked it. It would be more difficult for someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking at to go through and try to do something with my stuff. \ufffc So, my husband decided it would be \"helpful\" to go behind my back and have his mom do it. I noticed it as soon as I got home. I asked him if he had his mom do it. He completely lied to my face and told me he hired an organizing company to come in. It's the most disorganized mess I\u2019ve ever seen. I got suspicious a few days ago whenever it was so poorly organized that there were greeting cards in three different areas of the room. I decided to go through my husband's phone, because he kept saying it was this \"company he found on Facebook.\" I was curious what \"company\" he hired and also wanted to verify if it was really MIL like I suspected. Sure enough, it was his mom. I actually don't know if she just decided to do it, or if he asked her. I\u2019m seriously upset about it, though. \ufffcI don't think I can post SS of their convo, but basically she asked about cameras in our house and was worried I would go back and see it was really her. He said not to worry, I didn't know how to use the cameras (I do). She said to make sure he sticks to the story of it being an organizing company because \"later if you admit it, she'll hold it against me that I lied to her.\" He said not to worry and that he \"would take the fall if she ever finds out.\" \n\nSo who is TA here? \n\nI did go through his phone and got very upset and yelled at my husband about it so WIBTA here?", "created_utc": 1688790797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ttr19/aita_for_being_upset_about_husband_and_mil/", "score": 574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yikes!\n\nETA: TIL Craft scissors are for CRAFTS ONLY!", "My question is why was organizing your craft room such a big deal that your husband and MIL when to great lengths to scheme and plot and lie!  That is extremely troublesome and suggests that their effort was not about helping you but something else. You have every right to be upset. Going through his phone was not cool, but a far less concern than him and his mom gaslighting you. Confront him, and if he tries to veer the conversation to you looking through his phone, redirect him and tell him that you can talk about his concern once you are done talking about your concern. My gut is unsettled with this one and I hope it all works out well for you.", "NTA. That is such a violation of your space and your clearly stated wishes for your craft supplies. I have to wonder why your husband did this when he knew it was not what you wanted. His lying is a problem, but even if he really had hired someone to do this, it was still wrong to interfere with your plans and your things.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry you are finding things missing.  \n\nWhat else does he lie about?  Money?  Sex?  Gambling?  Yikes.", "NTA. Getting his mother to do this was a major breach of trust. Lying about it is worse. Planning to lie about it before the event is unforgivable. I would never be able to trust either of them again.", "NTA, why would your husband disrespect you like that?

I would ordinarily suggest therapy but in this case it would be too late for me. Good luck.", "INFO: Have you left anything else unpacked or is just your personal space? Also, do you talk about getting to it regularly but never actually do?\n\nI ask this because my wife didn't unpack some of her stuff for a year after we moved and it drove me fucking crazy to still have boxes in the corner of every room. I eventually just dragged it all down to the garage a few months ago so that we could actually enjoy the space in our house and so it would look presentable when guests came out (something that she constantly stressed about but never took care of).

It feels dismissive, diminishing, and unkind. It was more important that your room \"get done\" than it was to give you space and time to get to it when you were ready.

I wanted additional shelving and had ideas about how I wanted it organized. I did the rest of the house first so I could take my time with MY space. And let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s a big job. I needed to be in the right kind of mood.\n\nMy husband and kid don\u2019t even go into my room, let alone mess with my stuff.

How many times has the husband asked her to unpack? Why is it still not done? It\u2019s so important to her but she obviously hasn\u2019t used any of the stuff in months.
