I'm very much not a gun person, but the compromise of renting a storage unit to store the guns is a fair one. If you don't have the guns in the house (and especially no loaded guns), the safety issue relating to the child isn't there.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it seems like her issue is more anti-gun in general than it is anti-guns in the house, which I do understand. It's something that you're just going to have to decide whether it's the hill you want to die on.", "Since you\u2019ve stated that you have offered to move them to a safe location away from where the children live, NTA.\n\nBut as someone who owns a very large number of firearms and also has children, I also firmly believe the only acceptable way to have firearms in a home with children is to have them extremely secure, to the point that it is impossible for them, or anyone to access them without your explicit control.\n\nFor us I had a safe room built in the home here with numerous biometric identification locks for entry, and all ammo secured in safes. The only other option would have been to simply give them away to family and sell them.", "I don't like guns. I tried shooting one once and failed \ud83d\ude02. That being said I do have my grandmother's gun even though I said I'd never have a gun in my house. And I am going to say you are NTA. Your wife knew of your hobby before you married. She had the choice to not be with you if she had issues with your hobby. Granted I think there could be measures taken to make sure the antiques are disabled so they couldn't be fired. And other guns you may use for anything (shooting range, hunting etc) are in a locked gun cabinet or as you said, put them in storage. And of course responsible gun owners teach their children about gun safety.", "NTA this sounds like one of those situations where you wife thought she could \"change you\" and now that she is pregnant that you will roll over for her. \n\nThere are such things as gun safes, and keeping the safes in a locked room in the basement. As Well as separating firing pins from guns as an extra precaution. But I am guessing none of this will ever be enough.\n\nI can also guarantee that if you go down the storage unit route in about 12 months time the payments will get missed and there will be a special episode on Storage wars with a monstar find of high value guns.   \n\nYou both need to sit down and have an honest conversation with each other and see where you are both at.", "I wouldn't out in storage unit. Those things are not secure enough. Lock the gun room. Invest in lockers/gun safes. Store ammo in separate locked boxes. \n\nI don't shoot. My husband did. Hunting and target shooting. He had family pieces and a small nice collection. Never did half the stuff I listed and no problem raising my daughter in the house. My husband taught her gun safety. She took classes taught by local police officer for her permit. After my husband died, I had teen daughter choose what she wanted, gave left over family pieces to his father and his nephew, sold the rest. The sale helped put my daughter through college.", "Info - Has she explained why she doesn't want you keeping them in a storage unit? What exactly is her concern?", "I don't like guns, either; but she knew about the guns before you were married, and your compromise is most reasonable. NTA.", "NTA. She knew it was a hobby of yours before she met you and got with you knowing it. I understand she\u2019s concerned about the baby but she\u2019s being stubborn refusing your compromise, which to me is perfectly reasonable. Even if you didn\u2019t have sentimental guns in your collection, I\u2019d still not call you an asshole.", "NTA. \n\nIf you have unloaded guns that have trigger locks,  that are in locked cases/lockers, in a locked storage unit with surveillance cameras, and away from the house, I'm not sure what the concern is. They're not going to grow legs and march to your residential neighborhood.", "NTA because keeping them in a storage unit away from your house eliminates the very real danger to your child. Unless you can't afford the storage unit or you need the money from selling the guns.", "You seem like a responsible owner, so there\u2019s no issue as far as I\u2019m concerned. You\u2019re not mixing up your Glock for the pacifier are you? No? Okay well that\u2019s a good first step\u2026 \n\nAll jokes aside, moving them to a storage facility IS getting rid of them, from her concern\u2019s standpoint. I mean is your 4 year old going to get into your car and drive across town to get into the storage unit and gain access to the guns? No. \n\nNTA.", "Get the storage unit. It\u2019s an investment for baby\u2019s college fund.", "NTA I think the storage facility is a very fair compromise or setting up gun safes. My husband has a modest gun collection kept in a gun safe.", "NTA. You\u2019ve offered a more than fair compromise.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to get over her irrational gunphobia.   \n\nDon't allow her to bully you into getting rid of things you value. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to secure guns.\n\nYou can get combination or fingerprint controlled gun safes.\n\nYou can put a reinforced door for the room, with heavy duty locks.   Use fingerprint controlled locks. \n\nAnd MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL you can educate your wife and your children properly in gun safety, as soon as the children are old enough to begin to understand.  They need to know that all guns are loaded, all the time.   You never point a gun at anything or anyone you don't intend to kill.   And when you kill something or someone, it is really dead.   Life is not a cartoon.\n\nPeople who don't want their children to know about guns, are at a lower level of rationality as people who don't want their children to know about gay or trans people.  They all exist.   Everyone will encounter them. Denial is stupid.\n\nI am 99% sure that at some point, there will be legal medications in your home, that could kill someone, if misused.   But you don't refuse to have them.   You take serious precautions, and teach your children not to mess with medications.", "NTA considering you said you\u2019d get a separate storage facility away from the house. If you had said that you\u2019d just lock them up then my judgment would be different as there\u2019s so many stories where kids have still gotten into the locked cupboards and gotten into the guns. If they\u2019re not in the house at all then there\u2019s no problem.", "As long as you are responsible and lock them away with the ammo locked up separately, then I see no problem. I grew up in a house with loaded shotguns by the door. I was always taught not to touch them without permission and supervision. For our yearly family trips to the deer lease, Dad would have me hide his guns in my bed because he knew none of the other hunters would bother me. The ammo was kept elsewhere. Of course, I realize in this day and age that's just insane. But, honestly, NTA, just be responsible and keep them locked away.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of what your hobby is (and in this case, very safe alternatives were offered), this is pure manipulation on her part. This is a hobby/collection you've been developing since before she met you. I guess she thought she could change your mind about it, and is now resorting to pure manipulation.", "NTA.  Any weapons and ammo should ALWAYS been under lock and key anyhow.  She didn't have an issue in the beginning so why should a baby be any different?  Honestly, I'd leave them in the basement with the door locked.  And, this is an advantage to teach that child about gun safety and possibly, share a passion as he/she gets older.", "NTA. This is manipulative behavior on your wife's part. She was fine with the guns right up until the moment you got stuck with her for the rest of your life? Oh nah.\n\nIf she's not even cool with the guns being kept in storage away from the house then this is not at all about safety. This is about her trying to control you, and it will not stop with the guns. Beware of all this. Sorry you had to find out who she really is this way.", "Geez, just buy a big safe or two. They lock and would be safe.", "Keep in mind they are at a larger risk of being stolen in a storage unit and I could see possible liabilities if they are used in crimes.  My suggestion is to get a good quality gun safe large enough to store the whole collection.  Your wife knew of your hobby before she married you, there is no way I would get rid of them.  My guess is she planned to do this to you before you even got married.  Just needed the right excuse to make you get rid of them.\n\nIgnore the people that think if you own a gun you're going to murder 800 children in a school zone.  More people die from getting hit by cars and you don't see people screaming to limit people to 1 car or ban them all together.", "NTA. She knew about it and accepted it, you already offered a solution", "NTA: i don\u2019t like guns but it is your hobby and your wife was fully aware of your hobby from the start of your relation.\n\nThe fact that she wants you to get rid of it is unfair especially after you even want to store them away from your home.\n\nThe thing what bothers me is that she is demanding it after marriage and being pregnant (a divorce will have a big impact), it sounds manipulative and i think it can be a test of how far she can go on the long term..\n\nIf i was you i would stand my ground and not give up the hobby and make sure to get a secure storage solution because what will the next big thing she will demand?", "NTA.\n\n\"When I met my wife, I told her of this hobby of mine and, in the beginning, she was supportive. Then after we got married she sort of became resistant to it. \"\n\nYup, the old bait and switch routine.  She wasn't going to show her true colors until she had a ring on her finger and a baby in her belly.\n\nShe's totally wrong to object to the guns at all, seeing as she knew about your collection long before you got married.  But now you propose to put the guns in storage, and she's still not happy?\n\nThis is not about guns, dude.  It is a sh\\*t test.  You cave on this, and she literally owns you.  She will know that no matter how outrageous her demands get (and they will be constant), you will CAVE eventually if she's adamant enough.  Worse, she'll lose respect for you.  And then she's likely to cheat on you and divorce you.\n\nYou need to stand your ground on this, especially if she threatens to leave you.  She could indeed bale on you if she doesn't get her way.  But if she does get her way?  GUARANTEED your life will be a living hell until she leaves you anyway....\n\nSo think of it like removing a band-aid.  You keep your guns and risk losing your marriage quick.  But you get rid of your guns and the pain will last many years before you also lose your marriage.", "[deleted]", "No judgement, it just sucks this wasnt discussed prior. \n\nI wouldnt feel comfortable either given theres a story every week of a child killing themselves or a parent with another parents gun, but then again I wouldnt have continued to date you in the first place. \n\nJust get the storage unit.", "I'm guessing you're in the US.  I'm not in the US.  Most people aren't in the US.  Having so many weapons in dedicated rooms is very unusual for almost everyone.  Consider why the rest of the world doesn't do what you're doing, and why your wife might side with them.\n\nYTA for obscenely dangerous hobby.", "I do have some clarifying questions. \n\n1. Can you afford a storage shed to house your guns or would that be stretching the budget?\n\n2. How much are you spending on this hobby monthly, and with a baby on the way, can you afford to continue this?\n\n3. What exactly are your partner\u2019s reasons for removing the guns completely?\n\n4. Do you have any ideological mindsets that make her uneasy with you owning them? (No offence intended, just clarifying)\n\nWith the information we have, I\u2019d say NTA, unless you are spending way too much money on a hobby that your income can\u2019t upkeep, especially with a baby on the way.", "NTA.  Just get the storage unit and move them.  If it\u2019s not out-of-sight, out-of-mind for your wife, then she\u2019s being unnecessarily controlling about this.  (I\u2019d demand the guns out of the house too, but be fine with a storage locker and they NEVER come back into the house.)", "This is gonna get political so fast.\n\nBut from a pure safety perspective, YTA. Your family is FAR safer in a house without guns than one with guns. There are stats beyond stats on this; this is not an opinion. It is a fact. I get that you have an attachment to them, so maybe find someplace to store them if you can't bear the thought of giving them up. You have a choice: your guns or the safety and happiness of your family.", "NTA. Your compromise makes sense. The guns aren't in the house where a child could get to them and get hurt, but you still get to keep your collection. \n\nI am a woman, who has a child and doesn't have guns and unless she has some reason she or you haven't provided, I don't see what the problem with the proposed compromise is.", "NTA. I am your wife in this situation. Don\u2019t want guns near the baby or in the home. I grew up with a military/police household so the snipers, ARs, pistols, bows, shotguns, etc. in the house and locked away ina safe. We were all taught gun safety at a VERY VERY young age (hold, reload, shoot, never point at people, etc). But being in the medical field I\u2019ve seen even the safest people have dead kids because of accidents \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nAnyways, you compromised saying a storage site off house grounds and the kids could absolutely not get into that unless they stole your key when they\u2019re older. You\u2019re wife\u2019s the asshole for not compromising at all in the situation and just wanting her way. That\u2019s not how parenting works or a relationship.", "NTA. \n\nAs long as you can afford it, putting the guns in storage at a different location seems like a fair compromise. This is something that's clearly important to you, and some of the guns have sentimental value for you.\n\nBesides, isn't the collection worth something? It could be an investment for the future.", "NTA but I would highly recommend against putting them in storage personally, those things get broken into all of the time. Get a good secure gun safe for the house and put them in that or get rid of them completely. \n\nKeeping guns in the house isn't inherently dangerous, less so than in a storage unit for sure. Keep them secure so only you can get to them. Once your child is old enough, teach them gun safety and responsible gun ownership.", "I am not a gun owner. However, I was raised in a family of LE and Military so I know that it is possible to have them and be safe. My Dad had a safe for his service weapons and the others that were family collectibles or on display in his study  had the firing pins removed or trigger locks and zero ammunition available.", "\"Some are antiques\" you mean not all of them are? And you have munitions for them? In your house? WTF?", "Maybe this is all about money and she just want you to sell it and profit.", "[deleted]", "its pretty weird to collect deadly weapons as a hobby", "YTA.\n\nI am very pro 2nd amendment but this is excessive (an entire room FULL of guns???) and your attachments to having all of them seems unhealthy. How much is this collection worth? Is it a financial thing where your family would greatly benefit from that money? It seems you\u2019re leaving a lot out hence my rating.", "Having them far away from the kids in a secure storage location seems like a reasonable compromise to me tbh. The main point is that the guns are kept solidly away from the kids, which you seem happy to ensure- for now. On the flip side, I can absolutely understand her concern with your hobby, as it does involve dangerous weapons you've been keeping in your house, which is hecka weird to me as an Australian. From her perspective, she might be concerned about you eventually not being satisfied with not having your collection nearby, as it's normal for most people to prefer to have their favourite things close at hand. What then? Will you be happy having your collection stashed in a storage facility indefinitely, or at least until the kids grow up? Have a talk with her about her concerns", "NTA\n\nIm not anti gun but they scare me. My partner has MANY antique guns/collectibles and others for shooting. The antique/collectible are unable to fire. No firing pin or whatever with the muskets. The others are in a safe that is bolted to the floor and double locked\u2026we live in a state where you have to have gun locks and locked in a safe and ammo is stored/locked up separate. So yea. It\u2019s like that in our home. I feel comfortable with it because that\u2019s our compromise. \n\nBut you have to remember the definition of a compromise. You both come up with the plan. It\u2019s not just you telling her what you\u2019ll do. She needs to have input on what she\u2019s willing to do too. And she isn\u2019t willing to do anything that you stated. You need to ask her WHAT is her compromise. Maybe giving the keys of the storage unit to a responsible person she trusts, like your dad or her dad, so you can\u2019t just go get a gun. You need to figure out WHY she\u2019s wants you to get rid of them. Is it safety? Is it fear? Is it you spend too much time and money on them? You need to know WHY it\u2019s so important you get rid of them. \n\nBut honestly she\u2019s pregnant with her first kid, that\u2019s a mind fuck. You get so protective before they are here, it could be that. Pregnancy and her needing to protect that baby.", "NTA.

I don't think op should get rid of his guns, and they sounds like a responsible owner (although I can't be sure since there actually no real evidence of this in their post, they could as well be a full on gun toting redneck).\nThe problems with gun safe at home is that\n1) children are ingienous and they spend a lot of time at home, so they'll probably get in at some point if they want to. It might take 15 years, but it's likely to happen.\n2) the best security system is no match for human error, and I can see why the wife could be afraid the guns would be accessible to their child at some point. Either because the husband didn't lock the safe, or left a gun outside of it without realizing it, which is likely to happen since from what I've heard, a child is exhausting.\n\nI can also see why the storage unit wouldn't please the wife : if op goes shooting someday, he would probably come home to clean his guns before putting them back in storage. Which means there would be unsecured guns in the home (and maybe ammo too). Or op wouldn't want to take the time to go back to the storage unit late at night and might want to keep the gun for the night, leading to, once again, unsecured/lightly secured gun in the home.\nWe only got one side of the story here, and while I'm not accusing op of anything, maybe the reason the wife changed her mind about guns over time is she realized her husband isn't a responsible enough gun owner to have both guns and kids, no matter how the guns are handled in theory.", "Bait and switch assumes she was being malicious about. Truth is - people change minds. Assuming a big conspiracy of women wanting catch men with lies and then start telling the truth makes you sound kind of like an incel. The thing is she probably started thinking of children more after getting married if they wanted to have children and started thinking of implications of owning a gun and having a child.\n\nExpecting someone to stay the same, have same opinions through your whole relationship is unreasonable. If you are a person that has all the same opinions as you had 10 years, then sorry - but you probably aren\u2019t too smart and you are certainly very close-minded.\n\nAnd all those gun safety things\u2026 seriously underestimate children. Little rascals can get into anything. And if there is a gap in your security (which there always is; even the most secured systems get exploited and they get exploited through gaps), they will find it. If not in first few years of their life, then later.\n\nLike I will just add that OP isn\u2019t TA here. He is a bit nuts if he thinks that he can keep his guns 100% secure, but he isn\u2019t TA.", "this.  100x", "This has to be the most insecure and misogynistic take on this that is possible under the sun. Because having guns is more important than having a family, somehow? That if OP caves, his wife will leave him, but if he doesn't, she'll threaten to leave him? This whole comment is like a fever dream.", "Soooo. Guns are more important than people, your wife or your child? Toxic American bullshit.", "Good grief", "This is so dramatic.", "It was discussed, wife is being manipulative.", "If a child is trying to kill themself you\u2019ve got a LOT more problems than owning a gun. A person wanting to die isn\u2019t going to sit around waiting for a gun to fall into their lap, they\u2019ll just do it.", "He's saying they're in an off-site storage unit away from the place they live. It's like the same type of place you'd store furniture, clothing, and holiday decorations if you didn't have space where you lived.", "Yes, the guns are going to drive themselves from the storage facility via magic.  /S", "She knew of the hobby when she started dating him... If that was a serious concern for her why didn't she say a word about it until after marriage? To me that makes her the asshole because regardless of how you feel about someone's hobby she had ample time to air her issues with the guns or she didn't have to marry him and certainly didn't have to get pregnant by him. As you say the US is different and women here can be very manipulative compared to other countries. I'm not being hateful to women by the way I'm just speaking from what I've been told from people I've worked with over the years from countries around the world and they all have said women in America are much different than women in their countries.", "Also not in the US here. And if he was suggesting keeping them in the home I'd be agreeing with you, but he's suggesting a storage facility off site this seems a good compromise.", "1. We can afford it and it wouldn't be stretching the budget. Furthermore, it would be an investment and even if it wasn't it wouldn't effect our savings, retirement or the baby's college fund.\n2. On a monthly basis about $200-$400 (including range fees, carry insurance, membership fees, cost of my box of rounds, etc.) but it depends on what I'm shooting that month (but being generous you could take $300 per month, although its probably closer to $250). Then if there's something I find or I want to buy on top of that and that I'd have to calculate as it varies but that would be more of a yearly purchase.\n3. My wife says its dangerous for the baby and she's not ok with having guns around them. She's also become increasingly uncomfortable with them.\n4. Could you clarify on this? Are you asking for my politics?", "Besides the fact that OP said he'd move them out of the house, the guns would be no danger if there was no ammo to load them. Which isn't specified but at least in the case of the antiques can be assumed.", "Which is why I suggested having them in a storage unit (like a warehouse) far away from the house.", "He literally is offering to move the guns out of the house though. So how in the world is he an AH?", ">your guns or the safety and happiness of your family.\n\nThis is such a terrible euro or white suburbia take....", "Personally, I like to be able to protect myself and not be subjected to dying because someone else is crazy. But hey, guns shoot people right? Oh wait, people pull the trigger.", "Ammunition is kept separate and locked seperately. The room with the guns has a lock and the ammunition is in a separate large safe with its own lock.", "Stop being dramatic. Millions of people own guns safely. Not everyone is a fucking serial killer dude. And if a person is trying to harm or kill the selves, the gun is not the problem. If they really want to do it, they will find a way. They\u2019re not just waiting for a gun to do it.", "I want to continue to expand it and, one day, pass it on to my kids. I also want to teach my kids how to shoot and be responsible gun-owners like my dad taught me.", "Some people consider others having a plushie collection weird. \n\nThey're hobbies.", "It isn\u2019t weird at all. No weirder than collecting knives or anything else.", "It\u2019s a collection. A hobby. It isn\u2019t weird at all. And OP stated they are not short on money so it isn\u2019t financial.", "Australia has 3.5 million registered firearms and 260,000 illegal ones.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand what is her compromise in what you proposed? Giving her dad or OP\u2019s dad to the storage is not compromise on her part. It\u2019s further compromise on his part. The only compromise in this is her allowing him to continue owning the guns. The rest of the compromise is already coming from him and asking him to give the keys to someone else is unreasonable. I\u2019m not pro gun but even this seems insane to me on the wife\u2019s position", "The fuck is \u201cgun culture\u201d? All people I know with firearms are very safe and responsible with them.", "It literally says he did in the post.", "That\u2019s why OP said they could get a storage unit, to keep the guns somewhere away from their home. Read the post.", "And OP is compromising by putting all the guns in a storage unit so that there\u2019s no guns in the house. Wife is insisting that he gets rid of all his guns aka getting it rid of it as a possession, not just in the house.", "Hence OP's compromise of getting them out of the house and into a storage unit somewhere else.", "True, he needs to hide the storage room keys from her.", "[deleted]", "NTA, divorce the wife.", "You never heard of a gun safe?  Or a security room?   With biometric locks?  \n\nYou are just showing how little you know about gun safety.", ">Bait and switch assumes she was being malicious about. Truth is - people change minds.\n\nExcept as I pointed out earlier, this issue is not about guns.  As someone else wrote, swap guns for card collection.  Then the real issue is crystal clear.  It's all about control, about pushing boundaries to see how far they can be pushed.  \n\nThe wife made the assumption that she could change her man after marrying him.  Unfortunately, her odds were pretty darn good.  Most men would make peace just by getting rid of the guns.  Or the classic car they are lovingly restoring.  Or their 30-year collection of baseball cards.  Whatever, it's a mistake to allow your wife to dictate your interests.  And (ironically) it's a good way to lose your wife, if you try to please her like that.", "Don't you know women are malicious beings baiting poor little naive men with no backbone and showing true colors(they're hags!!!) the moment there's a ring on finger and baby in belly! Then they divorce poor little men and steal all their money then repeat the whole process because it's so fun!(Obviously satire)\n\nRedditors will go through all these mental gymnastics to somehow make women look malicious and blame them. Times change people's opinions change. She's just worried about the future child's safety. First time moms or moms in general can be a little extra worried about literally everything surrounding their child. Idk much about guns but keeping it in a storage unit and following gun safety protocols seems to be fair to me. OP and his partner needs to have more conversations on that matter. As of now OP is NTA.", ">Because having guns is more important than having a family, somehow? \n\nAgain, the focus on guns.  It's not a gun issue.  This boils down to, if family is important, then he needs to stand his ground on this issue.  To not do so is to risk losing his family S-L-O-W-L-Y and painfully.", "It's not about the guns moron. It's the fact she knew of his hobby before even starting a real relationship. It would be the same if his hobby was collecting baseball cards and all of a sudden she says he has to get rid of them all. He tried to make a compromise and she wouldn't even discuss it so it makes her the asshole because she wants to control him. She didn't care about the guns when she started dating him and didn't care when she said she would marry him. It was only after they got married she even said anything and only after she was pregnant she is trying to force this on him. If she was going to object to guns in the house with a child she should have made that clear in the dating phase long before marriage.", "Are you dense?

Is she worried you'll \"spread\" your hobby to your kids down the line?

Are you riding a white horse while this is happening?", "Do you know how irrational you sound? You collect machines invested with the sole purpose of killing people, and instead of having insured that they are no longer dangerous, you have everything on hand to make them work. This is awful.", "Because kids can't find keys? Look up the numbers of accidental deaths and self-inflicted wounds from guns, and maybe you'll see why your wife (and so many others) have such a problem with them. I mean, they're literally designed to kill people. That's their purpose. There's no such thing as a safe gun.

They\u2019re obviously a big part of your life and your upbringing, it would be unfathomable to not share your biggest hobbies and passions with your kids.", "What?", "People are allowed to change their minds. Maybe seeing all of the mass shootings, including mass shootings at schools did it. Maybe statistics. I have no idea, and I wonder if OP knows what changed her mind. To suggest she\u2019s pulling some malicious power move is stupid. The situation would be different if the thing being collected was anything else. Look at the guy who started collecting icelandic yogurt, everyone was like yep, he should get rid of that. This vitriol is about the guns.  \n\nAlso, no need to insult my intelligence.", "Are *you* dense? First of all, it was discussed prior, when they first started dating, as stated in the post. Second, that\u2019s why ammo is locked up and stored separately, and every gun is left unloaded as well as locked up. Kids who don\u2019t even know what a gun is certainly aren\u2019t going to unlock a safe and manage to load a gun. You\u2019re really reaching here. It\u2019s basic gun safety. And OP stated they do that as well as multiple other locks and backups for safety. OP is being very safe here. And children should absolutely be learning safety around firearms when they\u2019re old enough. Things like that happen when parents don\u2019t secure their weapons properly and don\u2019t teach their children firearm safety. Even a kid as young a 2 can be taught a basic understanding of safety around guns. Perhaps if gun safety was wider taught, these things wouldn\u2019t happen as much. \n\nHiding kids away from guns doesn\u2019t get rid of the very real issue that is safety. I feel much more comfortable with a firearm in my home, as I know I am able to protect myself and my family should something happen. I also spend time educating myself, safely securing them and practicing with them in order to create the safest scenarios when firearms are present. I\u2019ve had attempted break ins at my home multiple times, random people on my property in the middle of the night, suspicious people following me, both in car and on foot. I always knew I could protect myself if I had to in those scenarios, and wasn\u2019t counting on fate and hope should the worst case scenario happen.\n\nIt\u2019s cute that you have no logical comeback so you resort to blocking me.", "That\u2019s a pretty dramatic take. Your home is full of weapons already if you have a kitchen.

This comment is gonna piss of both sides.\n\nI voted for a democrat in the Texas state legislature but I'm lucky that my representatives are pro-2nd amendment. If they hadn't been I would not have. For the US Senate and the US House I vote Republican because the Democratic candidates weren't very good on gun rights. But I also don't like Cruz, so I'll vote for the democrat for the senate depending on the democrat's stance on the 2nd amendment. I voted democrat for the presidency last election and intend to this election.\n\nEdit: Nothing wrong with the vaccine. Covid or otherwise. I'm vaccinated, my wife's vaccinated, and I got the booster vaccine.", "That ruins their value.

Obviously we don't know her side but, it doesn't make OP an asshole because he hasn't changed she did and now she's forcing her views on him when she knew his from day one. Also if it was truly about safety then she would be open to making sure it's all stored safely or even the storage away from home. And statically a small child getting a parents gun is under 1%. She's clearly anti gun whether that's a new thing or was her belief all along really doesn't matter. If she can't be around guns she needs to leave OP.

Knives are not. The treadmill thing is a really far reach. Yes, life is dangerous. Having guns makes it even more dangerous. Again, that's their purpose. Swimming pools, cars, knives, sharp rocks, all have a purpose beyond killing things, which is why they're tolerated and regulated. \"Everything is risky so we have to tolerate all risks\" is a fallacious argument. \n\nThis is your family: your wife, your kid. Having a gun puts them at a much higher risk of getting injured or dying. These are the cold, indisputable facts of the case.
