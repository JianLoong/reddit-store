Cecilia, bless her heart, is helping, but that doesn't mean Op doesn't feel \"suffocated\" for lack of a better word. \n\nPersonally, I say NAH because Dee should get all the available help, and Cecilia is doing that, but Op has the right to feel he doesn't get a minute with his tiny little family.

Get up with your kid. Actually make the sacrifices, don\u2019t complain that someone else is \n\nAnd before sis leaves, you need to figure out childcare.

My darling wife and I have not slept in the same bedroom (save for the occasional weekend when the kids were staying overnight with the grandparents) since the eldest (8) was born.

Whilst this is understandable, there are a lot of other things you can do to participate in the parenting process.  \n\n\n1. enganging in tummy time with the baby;\n2. singing or reading to baby at bedtime;\n3. keeping track of stock levels (diapers, clothes, formula, other disposables) and refilling as and when necessary;\n4.

As such, said parent is expected to royally mess up on the few times they do engage in hands on parenting which could have dire consequences for the baby.  \n\n\nMy MIL did the confinement for my wife after the 1st one came out.
