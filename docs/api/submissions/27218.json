Cecilia, bless her heart, is helping, but that doesn't mean Op doesn't feel \"suffocated\" for lack of a better word. \n\nPersonally, I say NAH because Dee should get all the available help, and Cecilia is doing that, but Op has the right to feel he doesn't get a minute with his tiny little family.

Actually make the sacrifices, don\u2019t complain that someone else is \n\nAnd before sis leaves, you need to figure out childcare.

We\u2019d either put our baby in daycare (financially unsound) or Dee would have to leave her job, she makes about a third of what I make.\u201d\n\nI think SIL might be ruining his housewife fantasy. There is no actual plan for the sister leaving, but saying I want to do more is a lot more palatable then I want my wife to stay home.", "What was the split pre-baby?\n\nAnd why don't you move into the guest room to be woken up? You can also cook and clean on weekends - on weekdays, it'll probably be hard to get to it before your SIL but on weekends, get up and moving, do some cleaning, take the baby for some childcare, announce in the morning that you'll be making a specific meal for lunch/dinner, and then start prepping for it a few hours beforehand. \n\nYou're not the AH for wanting some space back, but it sounds like your wife needs the help. She just gave birth, so I'd say right now her needs trump yours. But if you want to do more, just do it. (And if Cecilia complains or pushes back, a polite \"I so appreciate everything you do. I know I don't do it as well as you do, but taking care of my family in this way is important to me, so I'll be doing this right now.\" would likely go a long way.)", "Who will look after the baby when you're both at work?", "ok but literally how?? OP says in a comment that they can't afford daycare and his wife would have to quit her job...which they also can't afford. Like, literally how did they plan to do this without Cecelia?", "And his wife will lose her maid, chef, and caregiver.  OP, take the baby monitor into your room at night or get another one if you think late night feedings are so special when you have to be at work in a few hours. AND you\u2019d be forcing your still-recovering wife to tend to domestic duties that would likely exhaust her.  YTA", "Communicate clearly and early. That is the only way to temper your discomfort. I hope it all works out.", "ughh this is a mess. so she expects that when she has a baby your wife will leave your house for 6 months (as per your other comments saying your wife wants her there for 6 months and then 50/50) you need to explain to cecilia that her expectations are way off , she is thinking she will be compensated in the future but it is very unlikely that your wife can reciprocate even for the official 40 days", "Are your wife and sister from an island in the Indian Ocean by any chance? 12 hours, 40 days, post-natal rituals ...\n\nI think a conversation around cultural beliefs would be helpful. Your wife and her sister may be making assumptions around your ideas of fatherhood based on their lived experienced of men and paternal involvement in their culture.", "You're both back at work, who is going to be looking after the baby if Cecilia isn't there?", "Why is her turn another problem?", "who will be taking car of the baby when you and wife are at work if Cecelia leaves? Can you afford daycare, because in a comment, you say that's not a financially good decision for you. What exactly is your plan?", "If this was a woman posting, we'd be supporting the fuck outta her. It's normal to want to do things with your own child and be a family unit with no one else around.", "These comments are BANANAS to me. He actually wants to take care of his child and his SIL is telling him no and *he\u2019s* TA? What alternate dimension am I fucking in? SIL is now an unwanted houseguest who\u2019s icing OP out of his role as the baby\u2019s father. I\u2019m infuriated for him.", "I'm a white American and I'm blown away by these judgements. OP just wants to bond with his family. Cecilia won't even allow him to get up with the baby at night unless he sleeps in a different room. 4 months is insane. I'd be incredibly annoyed too", "I'm not from a culture with intergenerational households but I agree with this. I would not have anyone coming to live with us to\"help out\".   \nI have 4 kids so I do know what it's like. My partner had 2 weeks paid leave after each and then I dealt with the baby on my own during the day. (I had 6-12 months leave) \n\nWe still shared the housework after the first 2 weeks so I don't know what another person would be doing in our house. \n\n  \nI know some have a hard time after birth but after a normal birth I don't get why so many people on Reddit think it's SO HARD to have children. Maybe they should read up about what it entails before having them?", "You need to figure out childcare before you ask her sister to leave. Does you wife actually make less than the cost of daycare for one child? Because quitting seems much more financially unsound than the average daycare, especially when you take into account the lost raises and career development until your kid is in school. Have you actually talked to her about your expectations?", "It sounds like both options are not financially sound since in your post you said you both need to work.\n\nCan you, your wife, and SIL talk and come to a compromise. There is no reason why you can't be involved in taking care of the baby.\n\n Your wife definitely needs the sleep so why not sleep in the guest bedroom with a baby monitor? Many couples do this so one partner can sleep when they don't have help.\n\nCan you do a family weekend for you, your wife, and the baby? You don't have to take a vacation just give your SIL the weekend off. You can cook and spend more time with the baby.\n\nSince SIL is handling a lot of the childcare you and your wife should be able to have date nights. Again you don't have to spend money at a resturaunt just cook a meal for the two of you.\n\nMaybe try two weeks without SIL there but first look up babysitters and calculate the cost. So you get an idea of the reality of life paying for childcare.", "I doubt they will find day care quick enough so wife will be forced too quit her job. It\u2019s pretty messed up.", "I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what she said at all. She may have meant it would be her turn to have a baby.  She might even be back with her parents.", "Lol. Thats not how it works at all, please look at my other comment. His wife will reciprocate however much she is able too. Thats how it works in these cultures, everybody helps it just happens SIL is a student taking online classes so she can help more right now but if she was a mother herself it wouldn\u2019t be possible. \n\nHer expectations are that her family will support her post partum the same way they\u2019ve been supporting all mothers for generations.", "because OP's wife will be expected to stay for god knows how long with Cecilia, while leaving her own family behind?", "This!!! I am inclined to say NAH. Because he and his wife have VERY different cultural backgrounds and expectations. They need to talk and get on the same page about what they want the family to look like.", "Amen, about time someone laid this down..its a valid point \ud83d\udc4c", "the woman in this case had a difficult delivery and is already back at work. Is the man recovering from pushing a baby out his privates? Is he breastfeeding?\n\nthe way people go on about equality when it comes to childbirth on reddit...y'all, there is no equality here.", "Yup. NTA. OP has a right to actually feel like a parent. \n\nLegitimately don't understand the Y-T-A people.\n\nIf the genders were reversed you know damn well this would be N-T-A.\n\nThe misandry in this thread is off the charts.", "the 40 days makes me think they're South Asian, and that's not how it works. It just means that when Cecelia has a baby, she will also get help. If wife cannot help in person, she can contribute money to a housecleaner, meals, etc. \n\nPeople on Reddit are always complaining about the lack of village for postpartum mothers. Well folks, this is the village. And the village exists for everyone, not just you.", "I\u2019m part of that type of culture and it doesn\u2019t work like that all the time. Her turn doesn\u2019t automatically mean it will be the sister, it would be whoever is most available. Shes also 21, i doubt she will be having a baby in the near future. Sometimes families bring the big kids along. The whole point is its a village for a reason, worst case scenario family will rotate. Dad watching the kid for a week or two while mom helps the sister who did sooo much for her for months would not be a big deal at all."]}
