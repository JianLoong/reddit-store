They've always held hands when walking or whatever, I just assumed it was a sibling thing they'd grow out of, but they never did. They also tend to sorta half cuddle, half spoon if they're laying down anywhere, complete with the hair stroking and all that stuff. My girlfriend even jokes that they have a better love language than we do, and she might not be wrong\n\nNow TBH this has been weird for a few years now, but our other friends and I figured we'd all keep our mouths shut since at the end of the day it isn't hurting anybody. The thing is my friend has started dating this girl in the last few weeks, and it's easy to see he's making her uncomfortable. \n\nThe other week me, my GF, his GF and sister, plus two other friends were out to get something to eat. While we're walking down, my friend lets go of his GF's hand to hold his sisters, and did that all the way to the place we were going to. She never said anything, but you could tell she was ticked about her boyfriend being more affectionate with his sister than her.\n\nSo she leaves, myself and one other friend are staying at his place, and he starts talking about how his girlfriend seemed pissed. I decided to not drop it this time and told him \"no shit, you were flirting with your sister the whole time\" I told him he should tone that down around his GF .our other friend kinda went too far and said something like \"Yeah you dropped her for your sister in front of her, you do that in bed too\" he got pissed and made us leave.

I think it's fair to call someone out when it's clear their actions are hurting someone else.\n\nMaybe you were slightly too strong with the delivery, but sometimes you need to be upfront to get the message across.", "NTA. If he's asked for advice on why his gf is pissed, or was willing to discuss it in front of you, it's fair to give an answer from an outsider's point of view. Your friend did get a bit personal, but again, if his gf is pissed an he can't work out why, he needs to know how it looks.\n\nIt's really weird, I've never met twins who do this, and I've known many. We had four sets in our school year. I think they would have died rather than be seen holding hands in public. \n\nAnd if I was the gf, I'd be out of there.... crazy stuff.", "Nta. No, dude. That's a weird af relationship even for twins. My brother and sister are twins and don't do any of that sh*ts when they're together. There's close, then there's incest.", "NTA as your friend brought up his girlfriend seemed pissed\u2026 and you told him what you saw. Your other friend took it too far maybe", "Y\u2019all should\u2019ve said something sooner, in my opinion. I don\u2019t have a problem with what you said, so I\u2019ll say NTA.  But I also agree with another redditor that this could\u2019ve been handled more sensitively and sooner than now when he got a girlfriend. Y\u2019all thought he was going to kick his sister to the curb that easily? \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - people can't fix what they don't know about.", "You are NTA\n\nYour friend is making his GF uncomfortable and idk why they have to be so weird about being siblings. Holding hands is a thing for some twins, but over your gf/fiance/spouses is just plain weird. Same with the spooning/cuddling on the couch--super damn weird. \n\nYour friend deserved to get put in his place by you and his other friend.", "NTA in telling him what you all are seeing, and what his gf seen, but the other friend could have left off the part about doing that in bed too.\n\nIt is very weird that they act that way at their age. There is being close, but that is a little to close.\n\nAnd wrong to drop the gf hand to hold his sisters hand. I mean come on what gf wouldn't get upset about that.\n\nHe is going to have a very hard time finding a woman who will put up with that in the first place.\n\nThey sound incestuous in a way.", "You are just some of what will be a whole series of people noticing just how \u201cclose\u201d your friend and his twin sister are.\n\nNo *shit* that his GF is unhappy that *he held his sisters hand instead of hers*. And cuddles/flirts/strokes hair\u2026\n\nYes, we all get it that twins have a \u201cspecial bond\u201d or whatever. Your friend brought up his GF being upset, all obvious. Dude. He needed a clue. You gave him one. He kicked you out. \n\n*He* brought it up. You told him what you thought. He got upset, but that does not make *you* the ass hole. NTA", "NTA but your friend is\n\nThe relationship is weird and my sister and I are twins. We're close but not that close. \n\nYour friend is an AH for the \"taking sister to bed comment\", that was uncalled for. You could've pointed out their relationship in a more respectful way.", "NTA- I\u2019ll admit the title at first had me totally prepared to call you an AH bc I\u2019m a twin, and my brother and I are best friends. But reading this, there definitely needs to be discussion had bc that\u2019s not normal.\n\nMy twin and I held hands all the time as a kid, but definitely stopped in like kindergarten.", "NTA, yeah twins often are weirdly close.. but this is broaching Jaimie and Cersei Lannister weirdly close.", "NTA someone had to say it", "NTA you said nothing wrong and it sounds kind of creepy but your friends could have been a bit better in there delivery the best way to drive some one away and make them ignore you point is to be condescending or make them feel attacked so they get defensive after all", "NTA but the other friend took it to far and is kind of an AH. However, If you friend is going to ever have a girlfriend then he will have to back off of this behavior with his sister. His girlfriend was snubbed by her boyfriend to hold hands with his sister. Who does that?", "Holy Jaime and Cersei vibes. NTA.", "INFO: did he ask you what you thought? Was he just complaining?", "NTA but maybe word it better, in a more constructive way, rather than saying he was flirting with his twin", "NTA...\nHe asked and got a reality check on what others see and they dont get.\nJust weird.....", "NTA. He asked, you answered. Whether it's weird or not doesn't even matter here.", "NTA. That seems like an unhealthy relationship they have.", "NTA there\u2019s close and the there\u2019s way too close. This is way too close.", "NTA\n\nHe asked for input and you were honest (although the delivery could\u2019ve been better)", "NTA your friend needs to be called out on this odd behaviour. He and his sister are not little kids where holding hands with siblings is seen as cute. They\u2019re adults and need to separate themselves from each other.\n\nYou have your friend an honest answer as to why his girlfriend was pissed off and if he\u2019s got any sense he\u2019ll modify his behaviour otherwise he\u2019s going to drive every girlfriend he gets away.", "Is your friends last name Lannister? NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou brought something to his attention that he may have otherwise not noticed.\n\nYour friend saying the bed thing was uncalled for though. But you giving an honest insight to what may have made his gf mad wasn't wrong.", "NTA.  It is weird, twins or not.  It's too close to incest if you're dropping an intimate partner to cuddle your sibling.  Gross", "Yikes, that sounds really, really weird. You are NTA for answering honestly, but it\u2019s probably going to take several significant others to get through to both of them.", "Gross .NTA this the type of criticism men respond too from other men. Made fun of him for strange behavior and he stops problem solved .", "Ultimately you were not wrong for bringing it up, but you were wrong in how and when you delivered it.  This is not a new observation.  Why did you wait until now to point this out?  I think the first time it struck you wrong would have been the time to say something to your friend, as kindly as possible.  \n\nBut because you did not, he's had years of your assumed acceptance, and then suddenly, you deliver a contrary opinion in the form of a jackhammer, as if he should have been reading your mind all along.", "First off, NTA. The other friend went a bit too far BUT that's not on you. He asked you a question, you gave a reasonable answer without going too far, but he needs to get that his behavior is making his GF uncomfortable (at least in your opinion, she should probably learn to speak up for herself as well).   \n\n\nMight want to reach out yourself to the GF. Some might think that's going too far but personally I'd say it's worth it to make sure you're not misreading it (Honestly I don't think you are, but as the offended party if you're going to speak up for her, better have her involved at least to make sure you're not talking out your posterior based on YOUR past). Might also help her to know that this isn't a new thing.   \n\n\nHe and his sister can do whatever, but he's also needs to understand this is going to effect his relationships going forward (AND the twin's!).", "This is weird. NTA.\n\n\" My girlfriend even jokes that they have a better love language than we do, and she might not be wrong\" - she is because you can't have a better LL than someone else :)", "NTA\n\nAre their last names Lannister?\n\nYes, I'm the AH now. Had to be said.", "NAH. Although the twins relationship are none of your business, you only pointed out the obvious by letting him know why his girlfriend was pissed because he didn't seem to get it. I'm guessing they're still very young and when they both date more, they'll figure out either to change the current dynamic or find someone who understands and accept their dynamic.", "NTA", "You went about it in a pretty asshole way, but it does sound like something he needs to hear.\n\nJust because you've all kept your mouths shut doesn't mean people in the future will. It also doesn't mean their potential partners will be comfortable with it.\n\nThey'll have to decide if they're OK possibly with being single with each other for their entire lives OR if they need to start building in healthier boundaries.\n\nESH", "YTA. Pointing out why his girlfriend was likely upset would have been fine. Accusing your friend of flirting with his sister is deeply insulting.", "YTA. My dude, she is his twin sister. Of course they have a close relationship. You're the one being weird by interpreting that as \"flirting.\"", "YTA You said it yourself it isn't a new thing and if you were a good friend you would have said it nicer so he understands how people perceive it from outside.\n\nThe problem is that we are brought up thinking that kind of affection and closeness is romantic and reserved only for romantic partners when in fact it's just a way of showing affection and it's pretty normal for twins to have such close bond that others doesn't understand and everything we don't understand we judge and shame.\n\nLearn how to nicely explain things without blowing up on your friends. You embarrassed him and no wonder his reaction was kicking you out. Definitely went to far mentioning sex aspect when i bet you he never thought of his sister that way.", "YTA. Their relationship is none of your business. If they are comfortable and happy with the relationship they share, that\u2019s all that matters. If it bothers his gf, it\u2019s up to her to bring it up. It doesn\u2019t concern you or any of your other friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
