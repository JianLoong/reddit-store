My husband kept the flat mostly because it\u2019s 5 minutes from his office so he could stay there whenever he has to work extra late.\n\nI was fine with him keeping it at first but it\u2019s causing more headache than it\u2019s worth at this point. My husband never spends the night even when he finishes late. Not to be tmi but the only thing we use it for is when he wants to have sex away from our kids. However, various members of our family have asked to stay there when they\u2019re visiting. There\u2019s currently an issue with my sister and stepsister because they both asked to use it at the same time and I\u2019m tired of this whole situation. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened and I\u2019ve told them both they can\u2019t use it now but I feel like this is going to happen again eventually.\n\nI suggested my husband sell it but he wouldn\u2019t even discuss it and straight up refused. We\u2019ve been arguing over it for a while because I think it\u2019s pointless for us to continue holding on to it when it sits empty most of the time. I referred to the flat as a glorified sex pad which my husband was offended by. Yesterday we had a big argument over it and he told me he didn\u2019t care if I wanted him to sell it because he wasn\u2019t going to and we could move back in and sell the house instead if I had a problem with it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679531000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11z2g8r/aita_for_trying_to_force_my_husband_to_sell_his/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whether it's your sisters or anyone else, the apartment belongs to your husband and scheduling guests should be left up to them.   If you don't want to deal with scheduling conflicts, tell him and everyone else that he handles *his* apartment* then step back and let him do it.", "YTA, I'm confused as to why you think this is your decision to make? You're welcome to have an opinion on it but forcing him?? The headaches you describe it causing sound really minor to me, you suggested he sell it he said no, that should be the end of it, you're not his boss and it's not your apartment.", "YTA.  If it\u2019s his property, that\u2019s a lifelong investment, you can\u2019t force him to get rid of something that doesn\u2019t belong to you.   Also your excuses doesn\u2019t make sense just tell your relatives that y\u2019all already sold the property and they can\u2019t stay there.  He shouldn\u2019t be forced to sell a property because you feel bad about telling no to your relatives", "Tell everyone you\u2019re renting it out, change the name on the mailbox to a fake one, and keep enjoying it without anyone knowing they can stay there.", "Are your finances combined or separate?

If the latter then it\u2019s his decision so it would be Y T A.", "Why don't you just rent it out?", "YTA - You have stated zero issues or \"headaches\" that would warrant selling the place, put another way you have not given any valid reason to sell the place so there can't be any discussion about it. If you don't want to manage sharing the place with your family then don't, but you don't sell property to avoid saying no to family.\n\nIt's an investment why would he sell it? What would be gained. Instead of being negative sell the upside to it. Selling a  property that is not your primary residence often comes with a nasty tax grab depending on where you live, if you have no pressing reason to sell it, don't.", "YTA\n\nYou've invented a problem all by yourself.

He doesn\u2019t need to sell.\n\nMy parents did that to me regarding a property I owned. None of my relatives want to deal with me (I dropped a rental contract on a cousin before when he wanted to live there) so they stopped asking.", "YTA None of your reasons hold a drop of water. You haven\u2019t mentioned why your husband doesn\u2019t want to sell, but doesn\u2019t seem like money is factoring in.", "I don\u2019t see a single *valid* reason in your post to sell it. If he can afford to keep it, it\u2019s literally an asset. Figure out your family drama and leave him out of it. I don\u2019t necessarily fault you for asking in case he already was thinking to sell anyway, but you got your answer. No means no. YTA.", "YTA. It was his before you got married, so you have no say in what he does with it. You can ask, but it's ultimately his decision. He obviously has some kind of attachment to it. Let him come around to getting rid of it on his own time.", "YTA, its his place not yours.  Also depending on where you live its a premarital asset and may be excluded from any future divorce proceedings.", "Seems a waste to leave it empty, but even so, it will likely only increase in value.   NAH  I get why you're frustrated with it sitting empty, but I totally get why he doesn't want to sell.", "Why wouldn't you use this as an income property?", "YTA the only headache is your sister's and you've solved that by no longer allowing them to use it. \n\nAlso why not reng it out or Airbnb it?", "I\u2019m going against the norm here. I would be very concerned about him having an affair and using this property. He won\u2019t sell, he won\u2019t rent, and he just wants it to sit empty for his after work activities. At the same time, you have shared finances, so your money is going toward upkeep/taxes. NTA", "I think YTA, this is his place and he can do what he wants with it. I don't know why this bothers you so much.", "If he wants to keep it, then tell everyone that wants to stay there, to contact him, all maintenance, taxes, etc, all on him and be done with it. Don\u2019t even go there to hook up with husband.", "YTA. Would be convenient if he sold it, because he'd have to split the money with you. While after a potential divorce he might have a home to go live to.", "YTA. You're mad you have to deal with owning it.", "Unless you have a better reason than your sisters, it sounds like YTA. Not a reason to sell a home. Just set and enforce some boundaries.", "So OP said in a comment he won't rent it.... why is he so stuck on keeping it? \n\nIf he doesn't sleep over there, if it's sentimental or an appreciating asset he could rent it to cover costs and still hold onto it. \n\nIt seems fishy to me to be honest.", "NTA honestly. I would be concerned why the hell he wants to keep it. It seems like he could be having an affair otherwise what\u2019s the point of keeping it? It\u2019s wasteful", "YTA - because if he sold it you would probably come up with 101 new ways to squander the proceeds of the sale haha!", "YTA calling it a glorified sex pad when the person he\u2019s having sex with is you is crazy", "INFO: who is he having sex with", "ESH. If it's HIS place, then he shouldn't be making you deal with your sister and stepsister and whoever else wants to use it; he needs to manage potential visitors. If it's owned by both of you, then he should take your input, because you're obviously doing the guest management.\n\nEither way, it's an asshole move to keep a second home you never use when there's a housing shortage on.\n\nAnd either way, calling it a glorified sex pad is saying that sex isn't that important to you -- which you know very well is why your husband is offended.\n\nIf you can't have an honest, calm discussion about this, then you need to wash your hands of the guest management aspect. Let it all be his problem and see how much he wants to keep it then.", "[deleted]", "YTA.\n\nHahaha, wow! What an astronomically irresponsible way of looking at an investment property!\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like the minor inconvenience this property presents, so sell it\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m trying to follow the rules and not use stronger wording but I would be LIVID if you were my partner and you tried pressuring me into selling one of our properties over such an embarrassingly small inconvenience.\n\nGet. Over it.", "Seems to me you've labelled this accurately as \"a glorified sex pad\" but I'm not sure you've thought through all the implications.\n\n> he could stay there whenever he has to work extra late.\n\nI can't possibly be the *only* person who reads this and thinks 'whenever he has to \"work\" extra late.'\n\nDo you have a key? Maybe you should let yourself in to surprise him, next time he's \"working extra late\".\n\nNTA, and in my opinion his refusal to even consider selling it is a **major** red flag.", "Nta, but he isn't getting rid of his cheat pad..", "NTA also one word \"divorce\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
