I hate even seeing other people on my break even if I like them.  My precious two 15s & a 30 are for ME. My lead coming to talk to me while I'm shoveling as much food as possible into my face, just no. I hide in the stairwells. An apartment would be *amazing*!\n\nEdit: more words make better?", "My apartment's body corp fees are ~$7000 a year (it is unusually high for my city, but still). On top of rates, taxes, and insurance, that's probably ~$9k a year to maintain. If the husband wants to spend the 9k to keep the apartment, he should pay for that in its' entirety (I am of the opinion that the husband should be allowed to keep the apartment if he chooses but if OP disagrees, the husband should foot the bill by himself).", "I say NTA. I know forcing spouses to do things is wrong but having an apartment sitting around not generating revenue is so ridiculous I feel that a reasonable person would have to insist on getting rid of it.", "These comments are so wild", "OP stated the husband doesn\u2019t want to rent it out. Why exactly is the husband holding onto a barely used property that he also refuses to use as a passive income source? Why would he be more willing to sell their current house than this place that, again, I\u2019d barely used? I don\u2019t even care is OP is the asshole at this point, wtf is going on with OP\u2019s husband? Cause this isn\u2019t really adding up to me.", "YTA his flat, his decision, it doesn\u2019t appear to be a financial burden, so step away from the argument.  Tell your family that the unit is rented out and that\u2019ll stop them asking for freebies.", "YTA. You want him to sell it because you can\u2019t manage telling your sister  or SIL it\u2019s unavailable. That\u2019s an absurd. It\u2019s real estate, therefore an investment that grows equity . \nIt\u2019s a good thing he isn\u2019t going there every night after work but prefers to come home you yet you still complain because it\u2019s empty . \nKudos to this man for not entertaining this nonsense of a request.", "At this point it feels like you\u2019re wondering why your husband wants to keep the apt and if it\u2019s a safe haven in case you divorce. It probably is. You either live with it or get counseling", "YTA.", "You say it\u2019s a hassle but it sounds like you only want to sell it because you don\u2019t want to let your family use it.  That\u2019s not exactly a hassle\u2026 just say \u201cNo\u201d!   YTA.  \n\nHave you actually asked your husband why he wants to hang on to it?    Is it a fantastic investment that is still gaining value?  You say he never uses it so it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s having an affair in it.   But maybe when you called it a sex pad that\u2019s what he thought you meant and that\u2019s why he was offended.    Whose name is it in?   Is he doing it to keep some assets separate?  What about a compromise and renting it out?    \n\nInstead of arguing try a civil conversation where instead of demanding he sell it, you discuss the problems and possible options for resolving them in a way that suits you both.", "Info: why can't your sister and step sister use it at the same time? People share motel rooms all the time why couldn't your sisters", "YTA. It's his property, not yours. So you have no say over it if your not paying taxes or rent on it. Seems like all you care about is money and your own selfishness. Who cares if the sister and step sister wants to use it at the same time? Who cares if anyone else wants to use it? It's not hurting you, now it is?", "Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to just have a calendar that you track who is staying there? My grandparents had a vacation condo and enough kids that it was almost always used. They just had a calendar that they would write down who was planning on staying there. It was first come first served. They would even book their own time and know when they didn\u2019t want anyone there. It worked great and there were never issues.\n\nThey even had written rules about cleaning etc\u2026", "Question: when you pressured him into getting a house did you ask for or allow his input on decor?

Set and enforce reasonable boundaries with your family.", "Right!!! Like I don\u2019t even get this argument or why this is an issue. Who asked to use it first?

All these women wanting decent housing and good school districts for their children are just squandering their poor taken advantage husband's and father of their kid they helped create. Fuckin women, not wanting to pay for an apartment thats solely used for sex, asking for family to be a priority. Ew. \n\nTruly awful of them to ask for a commitment when they get married and procreate.", "Is \"whenever he has to work extra late\" the only line you read?  It sure seems like it. Because you missed a lot.", "Great advice! Nice to be able to agree with a judgment on here for once. OPs husband definitely should divorce her. She's a greedy, controlling, manipulative AH. Nice call!", ">You only get return on investment if you rent it out or sell...\n\nOr he could keep it as a safety net to escape from an abusive or controlling spouse..", "LMAO oh brother.", "And she pointed out he never works late", "Oh hur hur.

They have children together. And combined finances. There\u2019s a point where, when getting into a legally binding relationship, you figure you share things and make decisions together.

The amount they are spending for him to have his own spare apartment, yikes.", "Or his buddies could use it for cheating or ONS.", "if they don't need the money then it is ILLOGICAL to allow strangers to live there in your place and then you can't pop in at all", "As opposed to \"hurr durr he's working late??? He must be cheating!!! No one works late!\"\n\nRight. Sips beer.", ">The benefit is a place closer to his work if necessary as well as an appreciating asset. There are absolutely benefits here. \n\nOkay, but how much closer to his work is it than their home? If it's a three hour commute I understand but say 45 minutes? No. If they have combined finances she's helping finance an apartment that is only used on his lunch break which is frankly incredibly wild and privileged. \n\nIf this post was 'aita for renting an apartment close to my work so I can play video games on lunch break and occasionally have sex with my wife.' Everyone here would being saying he's an asshole. \n\nIts not an investment if he's paying utilities and other fees without at least occasionally renting it out.", "Show me where I said the husband is cheating.", "Honestly i have a hard time believing his wife is the only one he has sex with in that apartment", "You did not, but the main comment did.

Plus getting upset at his wife calling it a sex pad\n\nEntirely possible I'm reading too much into it, but people come on this sub asking us to judge their lives and who am I to deny them?", "Maybe he\u2019s offended because he considers that the only place he can have one on one time with his wife, away from the kids, and she just thinks it\u2019s a fuck pad \n\nThat would piss me the fuck off"]}
