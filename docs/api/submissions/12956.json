Just put the rules for family that \u00ab\u00a0first come first serve\u00a0\u00bb and that\u2019s it, or put your husband in charge of the planning for it. \n\nIf it\u2019s his property you have no say on what he does with it and you should step down from the discussion.", "So instead of telling your family to stop asking to use it, you want to ask your husband to sell it? That\u2019s how you go about solving this issue that your family is causing? I would hate to marry someone like you", "I just want to say that after marrying Rita, Dexter kept his apartment....", "YTA. It's an appreciating asset that belongs to your husband. You don't get to tell him to sell it, and, honestly, it doesn't make sense to sell it unless you're desperately in need of the money. When it comes to friends and family using it, it's first come, first served. Your sisters bickering over it is a terrible justification for trying to force your husband to sell a six figure investment that he owns.", "YTA just don\u2019t let family stay there.    Set it up as an airBNB and make money off it then if family wants to use it they can pay for it.   That is a good compromise.", "YTA lite. But, instead, in a CALM MANNER,  Just tell him that:\n\n1. You will no longer be staying or even going to the apartment ever again.\n\nand\n\n2. If anyone no matter who they are ask about using the apartment you will be telling them to call your hubby and that you have absolutely NO authority or input as to can use it. Don't let them involve you.\n\nEdit: okay, maybe number 1. was a bit foolish, skip that one but really stick to 2.", "It\u2019s his property to do with what he wishes. Anyone who wants to stay there can ask him instead of you. YTA", "so your sisters can't sort this out so its your husbands fault huh?", "YTA\n\nIt's his property. You don't have to like it, but you sure as hell don't get to force him to get rid of it.", "Yup YTA. You\u2019re acting selfishly and trying to dictate what your husband does and then get mad when he doesn\u2019t follow your demands. That\u2019s not how a marriage works. And your doing this because you don\u2019t want to deal with your sisters? That\u2019s not a good enough reason to make this massive financial decision, not to mention you\u2019re heaping this problem onto your husband and marriage which have nothing to do with each other. You allowed simple scheduling problem to get this far and have taken it out on your husband.", "YTA. This isn't up to you. It's his apartment and he's keeping it. Why your family thinks they can stay there, and schedule it with you is beyond me. Why you are thinking you can make this choice is also beyond me.", "YTA. \n\nFrom the way you worded your title, I thought he was using it to cheat on you. But it's legit just his own place. It's not your apartment. He owned it before you guys got married. I don't care if he wants to use it as a sex pad or as his man cave or even just his quiet thinking space to paint Warhammer figurines. It's his, not yours. \n\nIf this was a drain on the finances because he's taking money away to pay it off, that's one thing. But you seem to only have an issue with it because you don't want to deal with your family members asking to use it. Your mild annoyance is not a valid reason to tell your husband to sell something. \n\nThere is a very simple solution to this. Tell them the truth -- it is your husband's property, and you have no right to dictate who can stay in it. If they want to plead their case, they can talk to him directly. Done.", "Not her decision,  but she is a spouse, so the properties they own and finances are her business as well. \n\nBut her excuse to get rid of it is still lame.", "Huh? Assuming they share their assets like most married couples then this is absolutely her decision to make. That doesn't make her reasoning valid, but it's absolutely her apartment.", "I don't think it's wrong that she has a say in it - they're married, and therefore she's liable for it as much as him with regards to taxes, upkeep, insurance, etc.", "It's not even necessary to complicate it this much. If someone wants to stay there, direct them to ask the husband. Every time. It's his flat, his headache. He can deal with any conflicts.", "Husband doesn\u2019t want to according to OP", "You answered your own question......it's her family who's arguing about this", "I don't think that makes a difference. \n\nBecause if her sister and step sister are arguing who should get to use the apartment.....yes thats OP job to handle it. Thats her family. And not even like a distant cousin or an aunt. This is her 2 sisters. \n\nYes it's on her to choose", "Except she stated that he owned the apartment before they were married. If she hasn't put any money into it, it is likely not a marital asset.", "I'm definitely not saying it's none of her business, but her choice of words was FORCE him to sell, which is just ridiculous to me.", "That depends on if he or she owned it before or after the marriage. \n\nProperty owned before a marriage is not jointly owned.", "He owned it before their marriage", "Not all returns are monetary", "> You only get return on investment if you rent it out or sell....\n\nNo. Utility is ROI, every bit of use they get out of it is a return on investment. It's an asset that can be used as collateral for a loan. And it's still an investment if they never sell it, and it passes to their children. So long as they own it, and it has value, it's an investment. Property typically appreciates in value - which makes it an investment regardless. So long as they own and maintain it, it is increasing their overall networth as it slowly - on average - appreciates in value.", "It's really sweet. He wants a sex pad to have sex with HIS WIFE! So nice.", "The renters might be a little put off when the OP & hubby drop by for sexy time away from the kids", "I'm an idiot.  I was thinking sister and SIL.  \n\nThank you.", ">I'm definitely not saying it's none of her business\n\nExcept that's exactly what the words you said mean.\n\n>you suggested he sell it he said no, that should be the end of it, you're not his boss and it's not your apartment.", "That may or may not matter depending on the juris diction.  I owned my townhouse before I met my wife.  After we got married we built a new house and sold the townhouse.  Even though her name wasn't on the title, she was still required to be at closing and sign off on the sale since we were now married.", "Read too far to see this pointed out. If a man tries to force his wife to sell a premarital dwelling against her will it is a YTA with a bunch of 'marinara' on the side. He seems determined to keep it and that is his decision as long as the money is there to upkeep. A downtown flat will hold or appreciate better than inflation a lot of the time anyway on top of this.", "Did I miss the part where they *pay* for the apartment? Sure, taxes are taxes, but I feel that the hotel room expenses would be higher in a year. What else do they jointly pay for for the place?", "I would think that this would be a good place for a short-term rental situation - that way if husband wants it, he can block off some time, but otherwise, he can pay for it by renting it out weekends. And when entitled in-laws make grabs, you can simply point to the one who booked it first ;)", "Unless the apartment is worth much more than the house.  No specific details were given on locations or values.", "Depending on where she lives, it may not be his alone if they\u2019re married. Plus, they share finances, so she is paying insurance and taxes on it.", "I didn't read anywhere that it was a financial problem for the family and might be already payed off,sure not using it at all seems like a waste but if the husband owns it as premarital asset then it isn't really up to debate for the wife if they don't struggle financially", "Short term rentals is going to massively jack-up the cost of upkeep and maintenance as the short-term tenants filter in and out, some of whom are just *not* going to treat the unit with respect and care.\n\nNot an perfect solution by any means.", "We don't know if OP is in the US\n\nIn UK you cannot rent out a mortgaged flat unless you change the mortgage to buy-to-let", "I'm the same way. People keep trying to talk to me while I'm on my breaks and it's the worst part of my day. My breaks are my me time, I have headphones on, everyone go tf away", "He had it before they were married so it's his. \nAt the very least they're both paying for it so the argument should be whether those funds come entirely from him or their joint money. Not \"sell it because I demand it\".", "He stores the blood slides of all his victims, his trophies if you will, in the AC unit in the flat. That\u2019s why he wants to keep it.", "Good to know. Flat is not commonly used in the US so OP may live elsewhere.", "Whether it\u2019s his or not depends on the laws where they live since they\u2019re married.", "Ahh my heart, I just watched both series and in some serious grief about the finale.", "That's true.  Some investment's don't pay off.  Still considered an investment IMHO.", "If you aren't aware of the gender pay gap and how it increases after parenthood feel free to Google it. Ignorance is not an excuse for *your* sexism and the huge amounts of projection in your replies. This seems very personal to you, but remember that your personal experiences don't discount national trends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cA woman\u2019s finances are always negative after marriage\u201d\n\nYou are literally misquoting me.
