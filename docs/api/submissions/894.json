This is my first post so apologies if I ramble or make mistakes. \nContext. \nSo it\u2019s my hubby\u2019s (41) fathers funeral is in 2 weeks, he passed away last week after a battle with brain cancer. We spent so much time taking care of him and miss him so much, anyway\u2026\u2026My sis called this morning and asked me to watch her dog the night before his funeral, I\u2019ve said no. I have 2 German shepards of my own which I am having looked after by a friend (in my home). I also have 4 girls at home aging from 9-14 who as you can imagine are devastated at the loss, not to mention what my hubby is feeling. I said I\u2019ll have so much to deal with on the morning of the funeral I can\u2019t do it. \nShe on the other hand thinks I\u2019m being selfish in not watching her dog overnight and asking my friend to watch her dog as well the next day until she is home at around 2pm ( funeral is at 1pm) she is going to an all night concert. \nMy friend that is watching my dogs is not charging and is doing it as a favour to us, we expect to be out of the house from around 10am ( to be with my mother in law) until around 6-7pm. There is a lot of family coming in for the funeral and friends from as far as Thailand, my fil was a popular and great man. \nSo DS is now bitching about me and how selfish I am to my other siblings and my mum and I\u2019m taking it in the neck for saying no. DS is the only sibling with no kids and is therefore still spoiled by my mum and never considers parental/family obligations in other thing we try do but I feel this is a new low. \nDS also has other options she just doesn\u2019t want to leave the dog (her baby) with someone else for 3 days and doesn\u2019t want to travel to make that time shorter (not a huge distance maybe 40 minute drive time)  so\u2026\u2026..

I mean not to mention your kids HER NIECES who will also be grieving and she's more focused on her all-night concert? That just screams selfishness and self-centeredness. I hope your family and loved ones are doing ok and I'm very sorry for your loss, her actions are the last thing you guys need right now so again NO NTAH", "NTA\n\nShe has no automatic right to your time and she's not even willing to do the bare minium. \n\nYou wouldn't be the AH even if you weren't dealing with the funeral and grief etc. but with it? of course not", "NTA\n\nYou don't even have to give a reason. Her dog is not your responsibility. She is not a little child. It doesn't matter whether she has familial obligations or not. She should be capable to understand that there is a lot going on in your life without your having to spell it out. Also, she should know that \"no\" is a very valid response when you're asking for favors.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is in her THIRTIES and can't understand that preparing and dealing with your father-in-law's funeral means you need to clear the decks of all extraneous tasks/responsibilities? You're expected to arrange for an extra dog so she can go to a concert while barely holding down 4 kids and 2 dogs of your own???\n\nShe sounds compassion-less and super-selfish. She can find someone for overnight. \n\nJFC, her failure to plan is not your emergency to deal with.", "NTA, she is the selfish one if she thinks you'll dog-sit for her when you and your family are grieving.", "NTA  so sorry for your loss and that you are dealing with someone who is so spoilt that she is causing you more distress when you are already grieving and supporting your family.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is TH", "Very much NTA. At NO POINT are you being selfish here. Look after you and yours. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA what a selfish and ridiculous request.", "I'm sorry for you and your family's loss.  Your SO's father clearly meant a lot to you and your husband and kids.\n\nIgnore your sister.  In fact, tell her that based on her inhumane and unreasonably spoilt behavior, you won't be dog sitting for a very long time.  It may be against your culture to do so, but you are allowed to go no contact or low contact with whomever you need to.  Stop answering calls, texts, and emails for a while.\n\nHer behavior is poor.  You're a good person so of  course you feel guilt.  But you've done nothing wrong.  She can get over herself.  Her problems are her problems, not yours.  Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  Good  luck to your family.", "OMG - just say no and NC the selfish person.
