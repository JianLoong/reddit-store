My wife and I lost our girl to a fatal fetal abnormality during the pregnancy. My grandma had made a blanket for her personally and we kept that, along with some outfits we picked up for her during the pregnancy. My sister wanted the blanket and some of the dresses we kept. She claimed the dresses were adorable and deserved to be worn and that the blanket was special and she wanted her daughter to have something like it since my 2 year old son had a blanket made for him too. Grandma did not make anything for my sister's daughter and now my sister feels like she should get the original blanket.\n\nI told my sister I would not give her the blanket and the dresses. I didn't think I would need to explain why but she said she couldn't understand me refusing her when we will never have more children and won't have a daughter to put into them. My sister and I argued and I put my foot down with her and told her she was being insensitive.\n\nAfter she got nowhere with me, she decided to go to my wife and asked her for the dresses and the blanket. My wife was inconsolable. My sister told her that they could be put to good use and would have a purpose instead of sitting in a box rotting away forever because no child ever got to use them. She used some guilt tripping tactics on my wife too saying that grandma and her were not in a good place and her daughter would feel awful knowing grandma cared more about her dead cousin than her.\n\nI was furious when my wife told me and I snapped at my sister the next time we spoke. I went out of my way to make sure I addressed this with her. My sister accused us of hoarding \"the good stuff\" and of not caring about her daughter. I told her she was the one who didn't seem to care about us and our pain and grief. I told her she was cruel pushing the issue after being told no and selfish for not addressing her issues with grandma directly and buying dresses for her daughter instead of trying to steal from us the few items we have that were meant for our daughter. I told her she should count herself lucky she has never been in our shoes and she should move on and stop what she was doing.\n\nMy sister told me we were the selfish ones, not her, and that we were way more cruel when we can act like we're excited to meet her daughter but be okay with the fact she'll never get a blanket like her cousins.\n\nI feel I should mention that my sister and grandma do not have a good relationship and they have not spoken in years. Grandma and I are close and she has a wonderful relationship with my wife. That is not the case for my sister and she's unlikely to even meet my sister's baby when she's born.\n\nAnyway, my sister is telling me I went too far in my reaction to her and I feel conflicted.

She should have left it at that and even then, the things she said were crazy, cruel & VERY insensitive!! You should follow your grandma's lead & stop speaking to her. She sounds incredibly selfish & manipulative.", "NTA", "NTA. OMG I am so sorry for your loss and that you have such a rude, entitled sister. Sending you and your wife a virtual hug and hope you both go no contact with your sister.", "NTA at all! Your sister is cruel, callous, childish and selfish. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Your sister is absolutely monstrous for trying to take precious items you saved to remind you of your daughter, and to so callously rationalize why she deserved it.", "NTA!  Your Sister is being incredibly hurtful!", "That chick be crazy \ud83d\ude1c", "NTA. Your sister is a thoughtless and manipulative cow. How can she possibly think you want to give up a memento that belonged to your late baby? SMDH at that one. She has no empathy and is completely selfish. Tell her to eff off.", "The only way her kid would feel bad about not having a grandmother knitted blanket is if she (your sister) made an issue of it with her own daughter. Otherwise, the kid would be blissfully unaware that it is even a thing. \nNTA", "Nta. It\u2019s clear to us all why grandma has nothing to do with your sister she probably sees the toxic AH that she is. Your sister asked a deeply inappropriate question but it was asked and answered and that should have been the end of it. She didn\u2019t let it go then went on to traumatise your wife. I\u2019d be cutting contact with her she will ever change", "Nta\nI am so sorry for your loss", "NTA", "NTA \nI feel sorry for your sister's kid though. Not because she didn't get a blanket but because she's going to have your sister as a mom.", "I am so sorry for your loss.  Your sister is unbelievable.\nMy uncle died as a young child, my gran kept some treasured items until she passed 80 years later, my mum, her only surviving child is not sentimental, but she now keeps her brothers items. \nJust because they are gone, doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get comfort from having their belongings, used or not, close by.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your sister asked an inappropriate question, got an answer, and kept going on and on about it. How could the idea that you would give her the blanket made for your daughter by your grandmother, even enter her head?\n\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your daughter OP.", "Absolutely NTA!!! I miscarried myself, and I\u2019ve kept all the baby clothes I\u2019d bought. (I hadn\u2019t gotten a lot, I was pretty early in, but still) I wouldn\u2019t give them to someone else. Will I hopefully have a chance to use them in the future?? I hope so! But that\u2019s for me to decide when it happens. \n\nYour sister needs to seriously learn some manners.", "NTA You keep the blanket and dresses, don't give a single thing to that horror show of a sister.  She is selfish and cruel and doesn't deserve to have those items. \n\nI am so sorry for yours and your wife's loss of your baby girl.  Keep her blanket and dresses as a good memory.  Perhaps you should build a shadow box for those items so they stay safe?", "NTA\n\nWhat the actual insensitive fuck am I reading? Even Satan would cringe at this sort of behavior", "Your wife should block your sister and if she needs to say anything, she can say it directly to you", "Imo the question should never have been asked in the first place. There are some lines you do not cross, this is one of them.\n\nWould of been one thing has OP and their wife said to the sister \"we want you to have these things for your daughter\" . This on the other hand is what I refer to as mega Ah behaviour.", "She gets a baby. They only get a few scraps of fabric to remind them of the baby they dreamed of. And she wants to take even that cold comfort away.", "She sounds like she was the type of child whose first reaction to a sibling's death would have been \u201cCan I have their room?\u201d", "And I'd be hurt if I was Grandma and you gave away the blanket I made especially for your baby.", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46", "She's probably even more miffed after this.", "Somehow \"AH\" isn't enough. She's more like what comes out of one.", "She should never be allowed to set foot in their house ever again.", "Seems more to me like she wants to create the illusion of a relationship with her grandma. \"See! She made this for my baby!\"", "The best place to hide them for now is to let grandma hold on to them for safekeeping until they can find a way to keep them safe from sister. A house safe is never a bad idea; it can also hold important family documents and even a stash of emergency cash.", "I'm sorry for your loss, and I wish for your daughter to be born happy and healthy.", "That seems like rewarding evil though.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
