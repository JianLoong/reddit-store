My wife and I lost our girl to a fatal fetal abnormality during the pregnancy. My grandma had made a blanket for her personally and we kept that, along with some outfits we picked up for her during the pregnancy. My sister wanted the blanket and some of the dresses we kept. She claimed the dresses were adorable and deserved to be worn and that the blanket was special and she wanted her daughter to have something like it since my 2 year old son had a blanket made for him too. Grandma did not make anything for my sister's daughter and now my sister feels like she should get the original blanket.\n\nI told my sister I would not give her the blanket and the dresses. I didn't think I would need to explain why but she said she couldn't understand me refusing her when we will never have more children and won't have a daughter to put into them. My sister and I argued and I put my foot down with her and told her she was being insensitive.\n\nAfter she got nowhere with me, she decided to go to my wife and asked her for the dresses and the blanket. My wife was inconsolable. My sister told her that they could be put to good use and would have a purpose instead of sitting in a box rotting away forever because no child ever got to use them. She used some guilt tripping tactics on my wife too saying that grandma and her were not in a good place and her daughter would feel awful knowing grandma cared more about her dead cousin than her.\n\nI was furious when my wife told me and I snapped at my sister the next time we spoke. I went out of my way to make sure I addressed this with her. My sister accused us of hoarding \"the good stuff\" and of not caring about her daughter. I told her she was the one who didn't seem to care about us and our pain and grief. I told her she was cruel pushing the issue after being told no and selfish for not addressing her issues with grandma directly and buying dresses for her daughter instead of trying to steal from us the few items we have that were meant for our daughter. I told her she should count herself lucky she has never been in our shoes and she should move on and stop what she was doing.\n\nMy sister told me we were the selfish ones, not her, and that we were way more cruel when we can act like we're excited to meet her daughter but be okay with the fact she'll never get a blanket like her cousins.\n\nI feel I should mention that my sister and grandma do not have a good relationship and they have not spoken in years. Grandma and I are close and she has a wonderful relationship with my wife. That is not the case for my sister and she's unlikely to even meet my sister's baby when she's born.\n\nAnyway, my sister is telling me I went too far in my reaction to her and I feel conflicted.

I personally thought it was such a beautiful idea and  permanent way to remember a loved one,  perhaps you both might like to have something like that created? As your grandma was the one to make the blanket for you all, she might actually be able to create something for you, if it's something you both ever decide you want. It could also be something that your wife, your grandma and maybe yourself could all work on together, to remember your little one.

I wish you both the very best. x", "First of all, please accept my condolences for your loss.
