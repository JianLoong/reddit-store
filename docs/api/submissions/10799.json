They ended up not coming to the dinner and told everyone their doors are open for visitors during the holidays. None of us visited as we were busy and the commute was too far. I feel like I\u2019ve done my part to see the baby with the dinner plans however it just didn\u2019t work out. \n\nLast week I received a call from Justin to come meet the baby and see my granddaughter. I told him I had Valentines dinner plans with my boyfriend and can\u2019t come. I could tell he was annoyed on the phone.

You very obviously do not actually want to meet your grandson and don't have any real interest in maintaining a relationship with your son's family.", "YTA for this (emphasis mine): \n\n>I do try to video chat to see their kids **once every few months** as Justin has made it clear in the past when **they haven\u2019t heard from me in over 8 months** that I need to make an effort. Life just gets in the way.\n\nI mean. FaceTiming or Zoom calls doesn't take that much effort and you're only doing it once every few months, so it's pretty clear where your priorities lie. Don't be surprised when your grandkids don't particularly care to see you either.", "YTA, they are busy with a newborn. It's going to be harder for them to make the trip for a while. You have several options, even if they're a little inconvenient. \n\nTake the bus even if it takes a while, 2 hours is not long though (bring a book or headphones). Could your boyfriend drive you? Another family member? I assume you don't work every single day of the week. You must have a couple days off here and there plus vacation days.", "YTA you arranged dinner plans once. Once in 4 months! Not having a car or transportation is on you. Either invite them over every week until it works out, have a bf or friend drive you to them, or get your ass on the bus. Stop making excuses!", "Doesn\u2019t sound like you are putting in any effort at all to meet the baby. And that\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t really want a relationship with them. That is your choice. \n\nSetting one group dinner at a restaurant is not \u201ceffort\u201d that was convenient for you, not for them. \n\nYou only call every couple months? Again - this is not effort. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be involved and you don\u2019t really care about you grandkids, all of that is fine - some people are just not like that and that is okay. \n\nBut - if you think you are actually trying and making an effort - you are very wrong. \n\nNot sure how to rule here, I\u2019ll add it later.", "YTA. If it was that important to you then you would put in the effort and \"they haven\u2019t heard from me in over 8 months\" does not sound like you are putting any effort into having a relationship with your oldest son. At some point people just get tired to trying when they are getting nothing back.", "YTA. You didn't do your best to see your grandbaby. You don't really want to see her either. I'd be seriously upset if you were my mother and thought you'd done your best to see your grandbaby when you live only an hour away. Inviting them to dinner at a restaurant when their baby was less than a month old is laughable. Take uber if you have to. Have a friend drive you. Suck it up and get on the bus. Lordy. Yes, YTA and your son and his wife have every right to be extremely upset with you.", "YTA but only because you have not told your son that you don't really want a family.", "YTA\n\nFirst, the dinner was two weeks after the baby was born? A newborn that young doesn't have an immune system and shouldn't be around a whole bunch of people. Also, the mom is still recovering from giving birth.  \n\n\nSecond, ONE attempt in three months from you IS NOT a fair effort to see your grandson. If you really wanted to meet him, you'd make it happen.", "YTA.", "YTA, and be prepared not to ever meet your grandchild.

You are asking if you covered your bases with Christmas dinner.  No.  You should want to meet your grandchild.  It should be important to you.  \n\nTake this for what it is, but if you were mom I would cut all ties.  Your priorities are elsewhere.  That causes so much pain that it's easier to be done than limp along.  Based on the wife cutting back, this is developing in his mind too.\n\nFix it before you can't.   Take a day and get there.  3 weeks later, do it again. Then do it again every 4 or 5 weeks.  It's not like they are asking you to babysit for them. Just show the most basic level of family ties.", "YTA. I see we're ending the week with the \"crappy grandparents\" edition. Your son and DIL live an hour away. 60 minutes. 3,600 seconds. They're not on the other side of the country; they're across town. You seriously have gone 8 months without contacting your grandchildren and expect them to do all the heavy lifting in the relationship? No, you're a sub par grandmother. \n\nYou asking them to meet you and the rest of your family in a busy crowded restaurant during the peak of cold and flu season with a new born was a bone-headed move on your part. I can't say that I blame them for not attending. You do know that RSV can kill an infant or don't you just give a shit?\n\nYou just noticed that your DIL has quit engaging with you and sending you photos of the kids?  Hmm, wonder how long ago she decided to drop the rope with you. You're not worth her time or effort any more. \n\n You're selfish; sounds like you want everything on your terms. Don't be surprised when they cut all contact with you, you deserve it.", "YTA.  Why did you ask ? Of course you are an A. Your personal convenience and  pleasure always comes first in this post.   \n\nFar from having done your part you  have actively  refused to do your part according to many cultures. Perhaps web search the role of  grandparent. \n\nYou are only two and half hours away and never really  cared enough to go to see the baby?   That is  so close. \n\n Your son has explained their minimum requirements to you very clearly, but you continue to hurt their feelings by not caring enough to even pretend to care by video chat..      \nProtecting their children from hurt feelings is a thing  many parents naturally do so not blame can attach to them for that.         \n\nYou were well aware that you were wanted, even needed, but did not care enough to act on that- so how can that possibly  be anyone's responsibility other than your own?       Even if every other person who associates with you  neglects your son and grandchildren  that is no excuse for you to do it. \n   \nYou do not tell of even thinking about  going there to emotionally help the family when they were struggling to cope with a baby and a toddler? \n Even if you are too ill to move much you could sit in the corner and  entertain a toddler.     \n\nA job that does not let you take time off or have a day off other than December 16th? Not even a half day on the weekend?  In many countries that have public transport that would be  illegal.   I do not think your job is to blame...  Even in places that reject western work standards you may be able make a dentist checkup appointment and take a day off and be protected by federal law.  ( you could pop over to see the baby after the appointment).\nThe post suggests you left the house in the past (and have people you could ask to help) so  you can use the coping methods you used then if you are nervous. \n\nAs for the boyfriend..  giant red flag that he doesn't mind you ditching your family.\n\nedit: also  it is often considered  unwise to take babies to restaurants as they may pick up an illness.", "I\u2019m going moderate asshole. Your son had a baby and he wants you to meet her. You have to go out of your way and make sacrifices for people you love. Two and a half hours on public transport is too much of a sacrifice for you? You get exactly one chance to meet this baby (as a baby) to form a bond. So far you\u2019ve shown your son that 2.5 hours and a valentines date are more important than meeting your grandchild. My personal take is that you suck beyond belief but maybe others will give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBy the way; *life gets in the way* of meeting your grandchildren? Like what? What\u2019s more important than meeting grandchildren? TV? Dinner dates? Work? Extra sleep? For fucks sake, take a day off and meet your family. \n\nTread lightly lady. You may not ever get a second chance.", "YTA, 2 hours away by public transit is not far to see your literal grandchild, they're not asking you to do it every weekend but not even once?! \nAlso you did your part, by inviting a couple with a newborn to go to a restaurant during a pandemic. during cold flu whooping cough season.", "YTA\n\nLady, I drove 7 hours round-trip last weekend to see family. I have also done it by train, by plane, and by bus. \n\nYou are being lazy. And you are making terrible and thin excuses.\n\nBy the way, your son lives close to you. Not far.\n\nTraveling with an infant is hard. It is on you, not them.", "YTA. Inviting them over once and declining one invite is not really making an effort. Have you tried scheduling a day/weekend you can go visit them, including the 5 hour commute? Perhaps asking a friend/family member to drive you halfway and your son/DIL to meet you halfway? What about asking one or more of the family members you saw at Christmas to go with you (if they have a car, they drive and you give them gas money, if no car, get a cab together). \n\nThey\u2019re lots of ways to make this work. And not to say \u201cyou have less going on\u201d but hypothetically, you have less going on than people with two small children.", "YTA. All I hear is excuses. Hosting one dinner when the baby was a newborn isn\u2019t making an effort.", "YTA for saying that you really want to meet your grandson and complaining that your daughter-in-law has stopped engaging with you and stopped sending you pictures. You have shown through actions that your son, grandson and their family are not important to you. That's entirely your choice but you don't get to be surprised or upset when they respond in kind.", "YTA. You think you did your part? Good grief. Bet you will blame them for you not having a relationship with your grandchildren. Nope. That is on you. You get busy and can't video chat? Why couldn't your boyfriend travel with you to meet the baby and see your grandchildren?", "YTA you have made no effort to see him or his children. He has a toddler and a newborn.

If you\u2019re not interested in your grandchild (or your own kid for that matter) just say so. Of course your dil quit sending you stuff, that tends to happen when a relationship is one sided.", "YTA for pretending to want to meet the baby and not just owning up to the fact that you don't care and don't wanna bother.", "YTA. If you wanted to see your grand baby, you would have made the effort by now.", "What hurts your son isn't that you haven't gone to see your grandchild, but that you clearly have no interest in seeing your grandchild.  By your own account, you went over 8 months without even doing a video chat.  I'm guessing the video chats are usually them reaching out to you, too.  Except for your \"come see me\" restaurant dinner invitation, you don't make any effort.  And BTW, hosting a night time event at a restaurant is not a kid-friendly type of invitation either, especially when you have young kids and a newborn.\n\nIt is your right not to have a relationship with your son or grandchildren.\n\nBut don't pretend to be oblivious as to how you are hurting him.\n\nAs for judgement, I'm going to go with YTA because while it is your right to not want a relationship, how you are going about it is unnecessarily hurtful, like you want him to be aware that you are too busy dating and prioritizing your life to spare even a video chat for his. Ouch.", "YTA -- it's a matter of priorities. Clearly, seeing your baby granddaughter is low on what matters to you. A video chat every eight months? A dinner with your boyfriend? Of course things haven't worked out -- you don't care if you ever see your granddaughter. Don't be surprised if your granddaughter grows up without the slightest interest in knowing you, either.", "It sounds like you just don't feel like making the effort, which has to suck for Justin. You're definitely sending the vibe that you don't think this trip is something you want to spend time on.

I thought this was going to be something about them not allowing you to,  but sounds like their doors are open.

Maybe try being empathetic and remember what it\u2019s like to be a parent of young children. Suck it up and get on a bus and go see your grandchild", "NTA.

The killer is, you feel like you done your part and don't need to do anymore because you invited them to travel an hour away to a restaurant, in the middle of flu season, with a toddler and less than a month old baby. When they (quite understandably) didn't come, you just leave it at that. You went 8 MONTHS(!!!) without contacting your son to speak to him,see how the grandchildren are etc but then seem surprised that DIL is no longer sending you pictures? Why would she bother? People who want to be a part of your life will make the effort. You have more important things to do than to facetime your son and grandchildren for 10 minutes on a Sunday every other week. Well she is raising your gandbabies and got more important things to be doing than sending pictures to someone who can't even make half an attempt at making the relationship more than 1 sided.", "If you don\u2019t want to be an active grandparent then so be it.

Seems like it\u2019s not your or their priority to see one another. Every family is different, some grandparents are more involved than others but that doesn\u2019t make them better/worse people. I think this assumption that grandparents need to drop everything to visit grandchildren often is strange. You raised your kids & them having their own children is their choice. I see nothing wrong with visiting a few times a year, maybe just holidays/special events.

Justin and his wife live an hour drive away however I don\u2019t drive or have a car therefore if I took public transportation it would take upwards of 2hr and a half to see them. Due to them living so far, me being busy with work and the cold winter weather I haven\u2019t made my way out to see the baby. \n\nI did host a Christmas dinner at a restaurant on December 16th for all my kids in which Justin and his wife said they would try their best to come with baby however they did say it\u2019s not guaranteed depending on how hectic it would be for them with a toddler and newborn. They ended up not coming to the dinner and told everyone their doors are open for visitors during the holidays. None of us visited as we were busy and the commute was too far. I feel like I\u2019ve done my part to see the baby with the dinner plans however it just didn\u2019t work out. \n\nLast week I received a call from Justin to come meet the baby and see my granddaughter. I told him I had Valentines dinner plans with my boyfriend and can\u2019t come. I could tell he was annoyed on the phone. I really want to meet my grandson however things just haven\u2019t worked out.\n\nI do try to video chat to see their kids once every few months as Justin has made it clear in the past when they haven\u2019t heard from me in over 8 months that I need to make an effort. Life just gets in the way. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed Justin\u2019s wife stopped sending me pictures of the kids nor does she engage with me about anything.\n\nReddit aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wouldn't judge you for it, it's your choice....but you seem to think that you are trying and that you do care but have not actually taken a single action to say this to them.

They always used distance as the excuse, even when we moved back to their state and were closer to them than my siblings. I could go eight months without hearing from them at all and saw them once a year at someone else\u2019s Christmas party.\n\nMeanwhile they saw my stepsibling on average once a month, my bio-sibling every few months, almost always making the drive. They spoke to them on the phone every day almost. Never made an effort to invite me to any of their get togethers.\n\nImagine the looks on their faces when word got back to them after NC when a relative asked how I was handling things and I bluntly replied, \u201cThey haven\u2019t really been part of my life in any substantial way since I turned 18 so\u2026 nothing feels different to me. Now we\u2019re just honest about how little the relationship means.\u201d", "Yes, I've heard that the journey is worth it.", "I never said she couldn\u2019t. I just think it\u2019s weird to assume she doesn\u2019t know how to drive\u2026. There\u2019s SO many reasons people don\u2019t drive, just pointing that out.", "I've heard many people with medical conditions that render them unable to drive simply say, \"I don't drive.\" Sometimes they don't like to say \"I can't\" b/c having said limitation has some shame associated with it.\n\nI suspect even if she'd included info about a disability or condition, the response would be \"why isn't that treatable?\" or \"I know someone with this condition and THEY still drive.\" Maybe she just didn't want to deal with that.", "> They haven\u2019t brought baby or ever been over because I haven\u2019t invited them over to the apartment I share with my boyfriend. I feel like Justin\u2019s wife would judge the living conditions. We have pets and a lot more clutter than their house.\n\nShe doesn't want them visiting her, she doesn't want to come to them, it's clear it's just a dont care attitude", "My brother lives 4-5 hours away (from my previous address) and I made it a point to go visit him and his family right as COVID was hitting. Now he lives across the state from me, but making the effort is the important part, and it doesn\u2019t sound like OP is making much effort.", "\u201cI\u2019ve totally blown off my kids and grandkids for years, AITA?\u201d", "Well typically I would potentially agree with this but the way she phrases it just seems like she doesn't want to make any effort to see her grandchild.", "Her son doesn't make an effort either. Relationships are two-way street. They both have the opportunity to compromise or to make an effort, and they both refuse. From him blaming her for not FaceTiming when FaceTiming works two ways, to her not wanting to stay the night at his house, these are both people's problems. That's why they all suck.", "Especially since OP has apparently gone more than 8 months without contacting them at all, even by phone, before. I mean how much lower an effort can you get? \n\nLike, I know 100% if I was to have had a kid, my mom would absolutely have been there faster than The Flash whether I wanted her there or not! I know not everyone has close relationships with their kids, but wow, OP can't be bothered to take a freaking bus over to see a new grandchild? Not even once?!?"]}
