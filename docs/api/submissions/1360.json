Why expose extra people, especially those with travel plans where they could spread it further, when your husband already has it? Yes,  you have to consider the daycare but if you wear a mask properly when showing symptoms, then you are far less likely to spread germs. Plus the daycare staff is presumably already in close contact with your child. \n\nPure cold-minded practicality says you should avoid leaving work when your partner has already called out. Beyond the paycheck loss, you have to worry about creating a reputation for leaving too often. It sucks, but mothers are already stereotyped as poor performers because of their family, and are far more likely than men to be terminated or disciplined for taking \"too much personal time\" to deal with family emergencies.", "NTA. He can get the child outside of the classroom. And the poor baby can stir himself to get there and pick him up.", "YTA. X10000000\n\nI don\u2019t get your logic. Potential exposure to your parents is a grave offense. But sending a sick person to a daycare and potentially getting dozens of children sick is the only solution. \n\nAlso, invalidating a symptom by sarcastically saying \u201cchills\u201d is truly messed up.", "I mean, no?

It's called being a parent.  And your husband saying it's different for you because \"you're stronger\" is complete bullshit. He's a baby.
