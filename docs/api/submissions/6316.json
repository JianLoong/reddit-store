I say this from personal experience.\n\nYour husband\u2019s family, while disgusted with his behavior, will eventually forgive him because his is their blood family.  MIL gave birth to him, raised him.  While she was probably very angry with him, that anger will subside because she gave birth to him, she will eventually forgive him because that\u2019s what moms do.\n\nThink about your children and if one of your kids did what your husband did to you.  You would be angry, but eventually forgive or find a way to forgive.\n\nYou are not a member of your husband\u2019s family.  You may have felt like a member and been treated like a member, but you are finding out that you are not.  You are the wife of their son brother, cousin.  You are his soon to be ex wife, MIL is your soon to be ex MIL.  You didn\u2019t grow up in your husband\u2019s family, you don\u2019t share their dna.  They treated you like a family member because you were his wife.  But you are about to be his ex.  So the bonds with his family are going to break when the marriage officially breaks through divorce.\n\nThis is the way it has to be because you need to move on to the next chapter without your husband.  They need to move on to their next chapter without you.  If you try to stay as part of the family, it will get more and more awkward and difficult.  They will eventually welcome him back to family events and by extension his girlfriend.\n\nYou need to consult with a divorce attorney asap.  He is not coming back.  And if he does, the marriage will never be the same because the trust was broken.  You and your children need to work your way through the grief and figure out what your next chapter looks like.  You need to help your kids navigate their new reality while you navigate yours.  You need to find and build a support system that is not linked to your soon to be ex husband\u2019s family.\n\nI had ringside seats to my brother\u2019s reprehensible conduct (same as your husband).  My mom adored my SIL, to the point where I was a bit jealous.  I had moved away for my career, so it was easy for my mom to treat my SIL like a daughter because I only visited a few times a year.  After 3 kids, my brother \u201cstepped out\u201d on the marriage.  My mom was so so very angry.  We all were.  She took SILs side.  Months went by the divorce was nasty, my soon to be ex SIL used my mom\u2019s good will towards her against my brother.  Eventually my mom realized that no matter what he had done, he was still her son, the one she nursed when he was sick, fixed his scraped knees\u2026 my ex SIL eventually moved on, my parents saw the grandkids, but without Ex SIL, she would drop them off when they wanted to visit.\n\nI know this hurts.  It\u2019s not fair.  It\u2019s not your fault.  But you can\u2019t move on and build a fulfilling life by maintaining a relationship with your soon to be ex husband\u2019s family because of what he did.\n\nI would suggest that you apologize to your soon to be ex MIL.  And get comfortable with these new titles, because that is your reality.\n\nI hope this helps\u2026", ">I know I may be overreacting, but I feel by accepting the gift she\u2019s in a sense accepting their relationship. \n\n\n\nShe is his mother, it\u2019s highly likely she\u2019s going to accept their relationship eventually. If they stay together she won\u2019t be his mistress anymore, she will just be his partner. It\u2019s understandable that it hurts you, but she\u2019s his mother not yours, odds are high she is going to choose to stand by him and accept his relationship with her eventually. You might want to find a support network outside of his side of the family.\n\n\n\nNAH, you asked, she said no.", "NAH\n\nExcept the husband is a HUGE AH. (not only for having the affair but also for putting his Mother in this difficult situation to begin with).\n\nThis is something difficult on both sides. \n\nI can absolutely understand how hurtful it is to you, his wife and her daughter in law for 25 years. But IMHO you cant dictate to her what she should do. \n\nShe is stuck between a rock and a hard place here.\n\nHer son has decided (for whatever reason) to make his Mistress an official part of his life. As such he chose to have her give his Mother a gift. \n\nYour Mother doesnt know if this new woman is fleeting or if her son will be divorcing you and marrying the new woman.\n\nNo matter what his Mother does, she is screwed. If she refuses to accept the gift (or display it) and her son marries the new woman, then the new relationship between her and the new girl (and possibly her son) is difficult. But her relationship with you, is 'good'.\n\nIf she accepts the gift and displays it, and her son breaks up with this new woman --- and lets say, stays with you, then her relationship with you (and possibly her son) is difficult. \n\nI remember my Mom saying (when my brother and his wife were having so many issues) 'I cant take sides. I have to accept whatever Bob (my brother) chooses to have me know or accept because wives may be divorced but my son is my child and is more important than the wives.\"", "NAH. I understand why this would upset you - it's like a symbol of the betrayal being openly displayed as a reminder of what happened and, whether your MIL is okay with it or not, it's like a symbol of acceptance of the mistress, and I'm sure that's hard.\n\nBut your ex is her son, and despite her feelings towards what happened, she loves him and will always want to support him. If he wants to make his current relationship work then she will have to \"accept\" it.\n\nShe's stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "NTA you need to cut this woman out of your life though. She's shown you how she feels about you,  believe her and get out.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t control her behavior, but you can control yours. If her accepting this gift makes you feel some kind of way (that she\u2019s disloyal, that she\u2019s co-signing the affair, that she doesn\u2019t care about the stress you\u2019re under), you do not have to spend time with her. Put distance between you and do not visit. Focus on your physical health and the well-being of your kids.", "YTA. \n\nWhat happened to you is terrible. Your ex-husband made a poor decision, and I apologize that you've had to experience so much in the last year.\n\nThat said, you're trying to control his mother's behavior. She will only ever be your mother in law; she will always be his mother. You need to be honest with yourself about the reality of this dynamic and start accepting that MIL and new woman are going to likely have a relationship as long as your husband is with her.", "YTA - I\u2019m sorry your husband is garbage. But he is this woman\u2019s son, and you will always be second place to that.", "NTA \n\nBut unfortunately she\u2019s going to side with her son. She\u2019s in a tough situation there.", "Gently, YTA.  I understand why you feel the way you feel, but this is her son and her home. In some sense, she might be accepting her son's relationship. I know that doesn't feel great, but the MIL doesn't have great options if she wants to have at least an okay relationship with her son.", "NTA. What your ex-husband has done is disgusting and inexcusable. I don't blame you at all for being triggered by the gift and I think it was really considerate of your mother-in-law to understand and take it out of sight. I'm sure she really sides with you on the important matters but it's just going to be her instinct to keep the peace with her son and I would try as hard as you can not to take it personally. I sincerely hope you're able to beat cancer and come out on the other side realizing that you deserve better than what your ex has given you and done to you.", "YTA\n\n\nI mean, not really, obviously in general it's your ex husband that's the AH, however in this situation, you can't ask your MIL to pick you over her son. Trying to control any other human isn't healthy. You can only control your own behaviours, not anyone else's.", "NTA but this is hard for your MIL. She's probably furious for the shitty behavior her son has demonstrated- but he is still her son. \n\nI think it would be fair to ask that if she is going to have a relationship with the mistress that she keeps you and your children blissfully unaware because the wound is still fresh. You are all healing. \n\nThere will come a time where for the sake of your kids you may have to play nice- denying your kids a relationship with their father will only backfire. But right now- you have a right to heal in whatever way is best for you.\n\nGood luck OP I am so sorry you have had to go through this.", "Firstly, sorry you\u2019re going through this. Secondly, YTA. You can\u2019t gatekeep who she associates with or what she accepts. Keep in mind, like his behavior or not, that\u2019s his mom.  You won\u2019t win if you push.", "Sadly, and even if they don\u2019t deserve it, unfaithful ex\u2019s parents are not going to choose an in-law over their own child. You can\u2019t win this one and YTA for even trying. If it\u2019s painful for you to see it there, it\u2019s reasonable to stop visiting. But the other woman may be there to stay, and it sucks, and cheaters are awful. I\u2019m so sorry.", "YTA\n\nThat's her son and whether or not he was a jerk, still her son and his life choices. He's a grown adult. And somis she. If that's what she wants to do, then that's what will do \n\nDoesn't mean it won't hurt, but sadly that's life.\n\nAnd at this point, he is separated from you and it's his partner now. Not his mistress.\n\nSorry you're going thru this.", "YTA while I'm sure it's painful for you. it's not like it's your mother doing it. he has moved on and you should also, his mother and her home so she can display whatever she chooses", "Sorry this happened to you and your kids especially when you have cancer.\n\nAnd I don't like typing this in your situation, but regarding the gift YTA here.  Your husband opted out of the family, and its your MIL's call on how to handle that with her son.\n\nConsider drawing thoughtful boundary regarding your in laws with no contact as the consequence.  Expecting your MIL to return the gift isn't a thoughtful boundary.\n\nI would strongly suggest a therapist.  They can help you during this stressful time confront reality: focus on the future and things you can control and avoid wasting time on the past and things you can't control.", "YTA- regardless of everything you do not have the right to dictate what your MIL keeps or displays in her home. With that being said, you also have the right not to go over there. It is poor form for your MIL but you can't control her and this action should show you where her priorities lie OP.", "YTA I\u2019m so sorry. Unfortunately, I think it is reasonable for your MIL to want a relationship with her son and that means having at least some interaction with his significant other. That person is no longer you. I think keeping a close connection with the in laws is likely to just hurt you if you can\u2019t transition to the idea that your ex husband\u2019s girlfriend/fianc\u00e9/wife in future is going to be treated as a daughter in law - because that\u2019s what she will be to them.", "YTA  \nYes, you have cancer.  \nYes, the son cheated on you.  \n\n\nBut it does not mean that the mother hates the son.  \n\n\nAnd Trying to get your MIL to get rid of a gift from the mistress might not be the best way to go forward.  \n\n\nYou have your own problems. \n\nEnjoy the life with your children before your health gets worse.", "YTA, are you expecting her to out you above her own son? Is not your place to tell her what to do", "NTA for asking but accept that she is keeping it. It could be that she feels you are on the way out as her dil and she accepts the mistress as her new dil to keep her son happy. You and your kids can decide how much of a relationship you wish to maintain with her.", "NAH, or not you and mil anyway, the only one of those here is the soon to be ex. \n\nBut its not that she's 'in a sense' accepting their relationship, she IS accepting their relationship. She's his mom and that's how it's going to happen unfortunately no matter how you feel about it. The choice is going to be up to you whether you want to be close to her in light of that.", "ESH except the MIL, she is unfortunately stuck in the middle and will most likely always side with her son. Your now EX husband and his new girlfriend are AH for obvious reasons, but IMO you need to move on, there is really no reason for you to be visiting your ex in-laws, dropping the kids off for the occasional visit and picking them up should be the only time you see them now.", "ESH \n\n\nBetrayal of a husband of 25 years must be hurtful. Especially if you are going through cancer -hope you will kick its ass soon-. Your MIL could be a bit more sensitive to this topic, yes. \nPeople grow out of a marriage/relationship, it happens. You can fell in love with another person which clearly what your ex did. You can call her \u201cmistress\u201d as many times as you want but she is currently your ex\u2019s new girlfriend and maybe one day will be his wife. And it seems like he is pretty serious in his relationship with her. So understandably his mother is not burning any bridges with her son and his potential life partner. \nI hope you can find a way to heal from this and focus only your life and your kids.", "It's more than reasonable to feel hurt by things that are connected to her. It's also fair enough to share with your MIL how you feel. Asking her specifically to put things away and/or return them (and especially being actively irritated with her for not complying) will make you the AH though, unfortunately. If you're choosing to maintain such a relationship with her, you'll have to accept that she's a part of her life, too.\n\nTry a boundary like \"I'd rather not hear about her/them, whether it's life updates about them, or experiences you've had with them, including knowing that things in the house are gifts from her.\"", "*Am I reading too much into it?*  \n\n\nYes.

Hoping that is just an oddity of the early responses. \n\n>I have remained close with his family who live nearby me and were disgusted by his behavior.\n\nFor all those giving the bad replies did you actually read the full post? The family is angry with the OP's husband for his reprehensible behavior. The OP was, completely understandably, hurt by having her MIL accepting and proudly displaying the item from the mistress. The OP then did the adult thing and expressed her feelings to the MIL. She didn't throw a tantrum. She didn't steal and destroy the item. She used her words. She can't force the MIL to do anything but she handled the situation the way someone should when they are hurt by someone they care for. \n\nNow, the OP has new information and does have decisions to make about her relationship with the in-laws going forward. In her shoes, I would probably pull back from contact with them to some extent. MIL has made choices that she is allowed to make but that doesn't mean OP needs to go out of her way to martyr herself to maintain things as they had previously been. In other words, actions have consequences. \n\nThe ages of the kids (young adults vs. 8 year old, for example) would influence how I'd approach this with children.
