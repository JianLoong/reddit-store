We moved to be closer to his family. I'm no contact with mine.\n\nMy mother in law has been referring to the baby as \"her\" baby this entire time. She will say things like \"I can't wait for my baby to be born.\" \"My baby is going to be so loved.\" This rubs me the wrong way for reasons I cannot explain, but my husband tells me to ignore her.\n\nMy MIL wanted to throw me a baby shower and invite her friends. She said they made an agreement a long time ago that they would celebrate each other's kids' weddings and births. My husband and I eloped and declined a reception for her friends since we don't know them. My MIL told me that I owed it to her to let her throw the baby shower since I hurt her friends' feelings by not having wedding reception. I asked if I could invite my friends, and she said no, that this was for her friends, and that if my friends wanted to throw me a shower they could. I reluctantly agreed.\n\nMy husband and I spent hours on our registry, and my MIL asked for it so she could share with her friends. She said she forwarded the registry on. She asked me what design I wanted on my cake and cookies. I told her flowers because I am decorating the nursery in a garden theme.\n\nAt the shower they provided me with a \"mother to be\" sash and my MIL a \"granny to be\" sash to wear. I noticed that the theme of the shower was circus animals. The cake had an elephant and balloons on it, and the cookies were animals. At first I thought that maybe the floral theme was just too difficult, so I rolled with it until it was time to open presents.\n\nEvery present was some sort of circus animal. Onesies, blankets, toys - nothing on my registry. I was a little confused and even went so far to check my registry to make sure I hadn't goofed up and changed everything. I thanked everyone for their gifts and tried to sound as gracious as possible, but I was so confused. \n\nMy husband, who is a little less tactful than I am, showed up at the end of the shower and noticed the theme right away. He goes \"what's up with all the circus animals?\" He looks at the presents and says, \"This isn't what we asked for.\" Then he looked at his mom and goes \"MOM. What did you do?\"\n\nShe smiled and said, \"I didn't like the theme you chose for my baby. I'm going to decorate my baby's nursery at my house with circus animals, so I created a registry for myself.\" My husband said, \"YOU DID WHAT?\" She says, \"My baby is going to need a room at my house so I threw a shower for myself.\"\n\nI lost my composure and told her that she would not see MY baby and to stop calling the baby hers, and my husband told his mom that she's delusional if she thinks we're going to allow this. She started crying and said we are just withholding her baby from her.\n\nWe've been getting texts from his family since the shower, calling us selfish and ungrateful and saying we ruined her joy of being a grandma.\n\nAre we the AH?", "created_utc": 1704308964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xr6e3/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_wont_be_seeing_my/", "score": 4974, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

You don\u2019t need or deserve this crap. I\u2019m glad your husband is handling this because it\u2019s so much worse when you\u2019re on your own. \n\nMy husband got his mom to stop with the \u201cmy baby\u201d by repeatedly answering all of her statements as himself. \u201cIm doing great mom, thanks for your concern\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not sure when you\u2019ll get to see me next, I\u2019m pretty busy with my newborn\u201d. And on and on. It took about three weeks but she finally gave up and started correctly referring to her grandchild. \n\nPlus a few discussions about how if she wants a solid relationship with her grandchildren, she needs to remember her role as a grandparent. We both grew up very close to our grandparents and fully support our kids having the same, but only if the relationship is actually benefitting our kids. And stressed out parents don\u2019t benefit our kids. They\u2019re adorable and charming, we can find other people who\u2019d love to fulfill a grandparent role in their lives if our parents can\u2019t manage to be a healthy influence.", "What the heck did I just read? Like... Just how creepy can your MIL get? She's pretty much trying to steal your child from you, so heck no, you're obviously NTA. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with a (good) grandmother expecting her grandchild to come over for sleepovers. There is nothing wrong with a grandmother to prepare a bedroom for that. There is nothing wrong with a grandmother deciding the theme for that room. But your MIL took it to an unacceptable level of creepiness. She had no right to throw a \"baby shower\" \"for herself\". That is NOT a what baby showers are for. If she wanted gifts from her friends, fine, but she...:\n\n1. ... should have been honest upfront.\n2. ... shouldn't have called it a baby shower.\n3. ... shouldn't have led you to believe you'd receive gifts from your registry.\n\nLikewise, she had no right to put herself at the same level as you with those sashes. Most of all, she absolutely has no right to call your baby hers, and that BS needs to stop.\n\nThis is decidedly NOT about her being a grandmother, and that's precisely the issue at hand. She doesn't see herself as a grandmother. She sees herself as your baby's mother, or at least at the same level as you. And that is NOT okay.\n\nCheers for your husband for finally stepping in. He should have trusted your intuition, but at least he's now taking your side.", "My husbands mum became as unhinged as this when we got pregnant. It began with her telling us she\u2019d come stay for a month before to ensure she is at the birth of her baby. We hadn\u2019t invited her nor wanted her at the birth. We were then told she\u2019d stay a couple of months after to bond with her baby and get them set up on her routine. We were being told how we would raise the baby and only she had a say. It was making my husband sick and this was not long after letting them back into our lives. He told her it had to stop or we couldn\u2019t have a relationship as it was making him ill. She went mad and of course she wants to blame and it\u2019s insane to think we the parents would have a say. So he cut them off totally.   \n\n\nYou know what he was relieved once he did it but it did take him therapy and time to mentally get over how sick she\u2019d made him. He was always clear that our lives would have been hell and it would never have gotten better if we hadn\u2019t stopped her. That he was glad we could just concentrate on ourselves and baby and just being new parents.\n\nYou are doing the right think a nee to block her access to all social media as monitor who can see your posts. Last thing you want is her using that to stalk you or post pictures and info on line about your baby. I\u2019d also set up security cameras around your home. If you use a babysitter or day care make sure to warn them about her. That she could try and take your child and is never to be allowed near. If she show up they\u2019ve to call the police.   \nThis is not overkill this is a woman who thinks she\u2019s fully entitled to your baby and that she will be the mother. Heck no.", "NTA make sure if she has keys to your home locks are changed. Make sure you invest in security cameras.\n\nLet the hospital know your mil is to be no where near your baby.

It\u2019s so freaking creepy and absolutely insane. NTA. This woman is not in a healthy enough headspace to be anywhere near your child.

His mother has many screws loose and I\u2019d move far far away.\n\nThis is just the beginning of a huge nightmare. \n\nI have to ask again if this is real?", "I shuddered reading this because it sounds like something my mother would do. The difference being that I could call my own mother a psycho and you had this unfortunate experience with your MIL. I\u2019m so glad your husband stood up for you.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA\n\nThis is very disturbing behavior..deranged in fact.\n\nIf you & your husband ever do relent & let her glimpse the baby, I know you will never let him or her out of your sight & that nursery will NEVER be used.\n\nI'm not usually alarmist, but please ensure you have security cameras installed in and around your home.

Change the locks if need be.\n\nCongratulations to you & your husband on your baby, hope all goes well.", "OMG, why did she even invite you to her circus themed, (appropriate, I roll my eyes)), baby shower, since it was for *her* and *her friends* for her \u201cbaby\u201d. \n\nShe could have just quietly had a party for her and all her little buddies, and they could have filled up the babies room at grandma\u2019s house, without even involving you. \n\nNTA for being weirded out over this whole thing.", "NTA. Her circus has plenty of clowns", "What the Oedipus?  She's putting herself in your place. She's 'having a baby' with her son, somewhere in her psyche.

This is creepy as fuck.", "NTA\n\nMy MIL (who lived in Texas while we were in Illinois) said something about setting up a nursery, and I looked at her and said: \"Exactly how often do you think we're going to be down at your house?\"\n\nMy kid is now 17 and I think he's been down to their place 5 or 6 times over 17 years.", "NTA - Because she said she was going to throw <i>you</i> a baby shower, and asked <i>you</i> the theme, then went and disregarded it all. And for all those people crying about denying a child a grandparent, it is obvs MIL didn't want to be grandma, but Mom. So no, she is not denying a child a grandparent, the grandparent denied the grandchild one.", "YIKES, NTA!!!!\n\nId get it if she said \"my grand baby\" or something to indicate that she wasn't the primary provider of that child. It's almost like she's treating you as a surrogate for \"her baby\".", "Does your husband have siblings?

My MIL has overstepped so many boundaries with my kids, my middle child in particular. And her \u201cshenanigans \u201c really had a certain stranglehold on my marriage until fairly recently. \n\nIt sounds like your husband is starting to see things the way you do. Don\u2019t let him revert back to excusing her behavior cuz it causes bigger (much bigger, really messed up) problems down the road. I promise. \n\nWe went super low contact with my MIL, supervised visits only. Once my husband saw things the way I\u2019ve seen them for ten years, suddenly I wasn\u2019t crazy or jealous or making stuff up anymore. Don\u2019t be like us. Your little fam deserves so much better. \n\nCongratulations on your little one. A garden nursery sounds so lovely.", "Absolutely NTA. It's your baby, not your mother-in-law's circus! The audacity to throw a shower for herself with a theme she likes without any consideration for your preferences is beyond selfish. Your feelings are valid, and it's important to set boundaries, especially when it comes to your child. The entitlement from your mother-in-law is astonishing, and you and your husband are well within your rights to stand up for your choices as parents. Don't let the guilt trips from his family make you question your decision. This is about your growing family, and their interference is unwarranted. Stick to your boundaries and enjoy your pregnancy without unnecessary drama.", "Cut off every single person siding with her.\n\nYou need to talk to your husband asap. This is the final straw. She will never be allowed to be alone with the baby. To be honest, I wouldn't have her near the baby ever. But you need to talk to your husband.

Some comments are mentioning she's 'unhinged' but your MIL is deliberately, methodically undermining you to get control over your family. It's working great for her--every encounter will be painful because, through small gestures and large-scale fuckery like the baby shower, she can make it clear you're just an incubator not worthy of respect. \n\nYou have every right to be repulsed by her, and it seems your husband feels the same? Her denying your status as the baby's mother is a good enough reason to quit dealing with her. He needs to be clear-eyed and very direct--pack away the circus animal baby room, call off the minions, learn some respect, act like a fucking grandparent.", "NTA This is some seriously unhinged behavior. I would go NC and if she shows up, call the cops and get a restraining order. \n\nCalling the baby \u201cher baby\u201d definitely irksome, but could be forgivable.

I love it!", "I'd also be cautious about ingesting anything the MIL provides specifically for you.", "From what I\u2019ve gathered she sent them a registry she created in my name so they thought they were buying for me.", "Mil wanted her incubator there to show off the bump. Mil is crazy", "Yeah. I was very careful when pivking my kids schools because when i was 7 I was very lucky that it was my dad who walked into my after school care (at a daycare) grabbed me and my bag and left without talking to a staff member or signing me out and my mum and dad were going through a messy divorce at the time. \n\nMum knew dad was picking me up because she had told him she would be late at work and it was his visitation weekend so she said to just do hand over that way and when dad told her what he did, well atleast I never went back there.", "I remember ages ago before all this security was enforced.  Possibly Australia was a bit slower to take this up.\n\nMy Grandpa had to pick up my younger sister from daycare.  When he got there to pick her up she wanted to play longer so said she didn't know him.\n\nIn those days anyone could pick up a child if they knew the child's name!", "Considering that many kidnapping cases are due to family members, it doesn't matter that your child called you 'daddy'.  You could still have been there to kidnap her; that's why they checked the list.", "Okay, so here is an idea. Tell her you need their addresses so you can send thank you notes.\n\nThen, you clear things up in the thank you notes.\n\n\"Dear Name,\n\nI wanted to thank you for coming to our babyshower. My husband and I appreciate the effort that went in to the planning. However, we were confused when MIL created a different registry with her taste and then took posession of all of the gifts you and the other guests so kindly blessed us with. \n\nEven though it has been made clear by MIL that the gifts do not belong to us and she is keeping them, I want you to know I am grateful for your kindness towards my husband and I.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nName\n\nYou can fight fire with fire here. Kill them with kindness... and truth.\n\nAs for your MIL - think long and hard about whether you guys want to deal with this because this is the time for you guys to SERIOUSLY consider moving elsewhere. I would not engage with her. I would absolutely plan to move many hours away because her attitude towards your child is going to be a BIG problem. She will undermine you as parents every chance she gets.\n\nI wish you luck.", "Seriously unhinged and creepy. She deceived her own friends? Don\u2019t let her come to the hospital or to your home until you\u2019re fully recovered, and then only supervised visits with baby. \n\nI hope you\u2019re not considering sleepovers until the child is older and can talk, and only if this craziness calms down.", ">Possibly Australia was a bit slower to take this up.\n\nAlso Australia. My comment about my dad picking me up from school without signing me out was 26 years ago and my eldest is 11 and his daycare had the passcode on the door and lists to compare ids to.", "Oh my. What a brat lol. That could cause some trouble these days.", "LOL wow she was a trouble maker!  My brother once disappeared from a school function in middle school - they were having a picnic/field day at a park that was a block away from our house, which we (my brothers and I) had all been walking to and from since we were in approximately first grade. So when he got bored of the picnic he simply\u2026walked home. Nobody even knew he was missing until they were ready to leave and doing a head count \ud83d\ude02 luckily one of his friends knew which street we lived on so the teachers knocked on every door on our block until they found him \ud83d\ude02 things were just different back then", "Thank you. I\u2019m aware of that", "I\u2019ve already told my husband that she isn\u2019t staying with anyone unless it\u2019s an emergency for a long time.", "My dumbass brother asked me to pick up my niece and when I asked if it wouldn\u2019t be an issue he said no. Of course it was\n\nHe is divorced so they called his ex wife who gave me permission but dumbass got an earful."]}
