While my grandparents were always in my life. When my dad was alive we saw them all the time. After he died I stayed close to them but mom and them had a lot of disagreements and they no longer speak. I was 6 when dad died. Mom remarried a year later. My parents marriage wasn't great and I have been made aware of that so I think moving on fast helped my mom a lot. She was able to enjoy a relationship again.

But they know I don't say parents to mean my mom's husband. They refer to him as more of a familial title than I do.\n\nBut anyway. I have three half siblings. They are not included by my grandparents, which makes sense to me because they are not family. I always go to my grandparents, they never come to my mom's house.

But it upsets my half siblings and bothers my mom and her husband that I have grandparents, and an extended family, but not my half siblings.\n\nFor about a year now I feel like my mom and her husband take it out on me.

This is how it often works with blended families, one side is jealous that the other side has more (or, in some cases, less) family than the other.  There are, unfortunately,  people in this world who think that they can dictate the feelings of others.  My own experience was that I adopted a child who then became jealous that her now half-sister had a father and she didn't, and the child with a father was jealous that the adopted child got to have extra one-on-one time with me while she was visiting her dad.  Each person in a blended family gets to choose how to define those relationships. Include, don't include, it's pretty much a personal decision.  Based on your mom's history, your grandparents have every reason not to entangle themselves in her life through her children who have no relation to them.

I would not want to be your age again for anything and have to deal with all that stuff over again.\n\nWith that being said, make sure you establish strong ties with your half siblings now and make sure they know that you see that it hurts them to see all this stuff going on.\n\nYour mom and step dad don't sound like bad people or anything like that, but they are trying to force a blended family into a non-blended family where everything is perfect, etc.\n\nSadly, this doesn't usually work out for all the parties involved. If your siblings constantly see you getting gifts, love, etc. from your grandparents while they get the nothing, they will grow to resent you personally even though you haven't done anything to deserve the resentment. This is because through their eyes, they will see you as being spoiled and more loved than them.\n\nOf course that doesn't seem to be the case, but your mom is just trying to make everyone happy and make this family work.\n\nThis may not make sense to you now, but it will when you're older.

But my grandparents are not related to my half siblings in any kind of way and that's something my mom and her husband don't want to accept.", "Yeah, it really is something that not everyone thinks about. There's nothing wrong with remarrying and adding kids to your life (either stepkids or bio kids from another marriage/relationship or even single parents). But my mom never thought about the fact she married a guy with similar circumstances to her and would not have a set of grandparents between the two of them, but I always would. I think she assumed my grandparents would just be like we'll take on those kids too. Doesn't always work that way.", "Yes, when I turn 18 I want to go live with them and attend the local community college. My grandparents love the idea.", "OP clearly specifies that his mom's husband is just that: his mom's husband, he hasn't earned the title of stepfather.", "It\u2019s way not that simple. First of all my mother moved out initially and it seemed like my parents were going to get divorced. Second of all my father has accepted her in the home but no one at his work knows about her and he has made no effort to include her in the wider family.\nThird of all I am out of home and finally my grandparents have no relationship with my sister and that is my parents fault.\nMy grandparents live in another country. My parents dont call and when my mum goes to visit her family in that country she has never made any attempt to visit the grandparents. \nMy grandparents are always polite when they are with the family, they bring gifts for her when they come to visit if they are bringing gifts for everyone else and they don\u2019t say anything when she calls them nanna and pop. \nIt doesn\u2019t mean much at the moment but this will all come out in the next few years. At the moment they visit every other year but it\u2019s only a matter of time until she starts asking questions.\nNo one sees how close I am with my grandparents because I am old enough where I don\u2019t need my parents to facilitate the relationship. This mess if fully on my parents.\nKeep in mind my parents live together but in opposite ends of the house and they don\u2019t like each other.", "But are you blaming your child for the loss of grandparents? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "Thanks for explaining. Such a sad situation for your sister. Doesn\u2019t sound like it was great for you either. And that your grandparents do the best they can under the circumstances. I hope you both prosper and find some happiness in spite of past obstacles.", "It\u2019s a shit show and my parents like to sweep things under the rug. I was 18 when it all went down and now my parents like to play happy families when the grandparents come to visit. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. I\u2019m always going to be there for my sister but I won\u2019t judge my grandparents for not having a relationship with her. They assumed, we all assumed that divorce was on the cards."]}
