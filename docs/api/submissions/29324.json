But my half siblings (via mom) have no grandparents. Mom's parents are not in our lives and never were. My mom's husband's parents are also not in the picture. It's always been that way. While my grandparents were always in my life. When my dad was alive we saw them all the time. After he died I stayed close to them but mom and them had a lot of disagreements and they no longer speak. I was 6 when dad died. Mom remarried a year later. My parents marriage wasn't great and I have been made aware of that so I think moving on fast helped my mom a lot. She was able to enjoy a relationship again. I never had the greatest relationship with her husband. I think he always had some bad feelings toward my grandparents because they stayed so involved with me but weren't part of the wider family and they always referred to him as my stepdad while he feels they should have said \"parents\" vs mom and stepdad to me. But they know I don't say parents to mean my mom's husband. They refer to him as more of a familial title than I do.\n\nBut anyway. I have three half siblings. They are not included by my grandparents, which makes sense to me because they are not family. I always go to my grandparents, they never come to my mom's house. So it's not like it's being rubbed in my half siblings faces. But it upsets my half siblings and bothers my mom and her husband that I have grandparents, and an extended family, but not my half siblings.\n\nFor about a year now I feel like my mom and her husband take it out on me. It started because they were dropping more hints that I should ask my grandparents to invite my half siblings over/out with us. But I didn't want to do that. Then my mom would put roadblocks up so I couldn't go with them. Her husband would grumble every time I was about ready to go. They would try to come up with mandatory \"family obligations\" we had with each other. Then came snarky comments about me not giving a shit about \"my baby siblings\" and how my half siblings were watching me and seeing that I loved people who denied them. I snapped when that comment came up from my mom and told her it was not my fault my half siblings don't have grandparents and that she should stop taking it out on me.\n\nMom said I really didn't give a shit and I had no idea why they were upset with me.

Your paternal grandparents have no familial relationship or obligation to your half siblings.", "Your mom and stepdad are trash. \nNTA.", "YOur mom is wrong. Sorry.  Dont cound on mom helping  you with college.", "NTA. Sounds like they just want some free babysitting", "Your mother and step-father are behaving very badly toward you.  The notion that maintaining a relationship with your grandparents shows you don't care about your step-siblings is absurd.  \n\nI'm not sure where you are, but in many places grandparents and grandchildren have the legal right to see each other, and at 16, you might even have the right to choose to live with your grandparents if your mother and step-father are treating you badly and putting up roadblocks to you seeing your grandparents.\n\nIf your grandparents are in a financial position to do so, they might want to talk to a lawyer.\n\nMeanwhile, you're doing nothing wrong; your mother and step-father are.  These are your grandparents, not your step-siblings' grandparents, and the grandparents have no obligation to have anything to do with them.  (If your mom had wanted the grandparents in these children's lives and as part of the extended family, she should have been inviting them over and engaging with them for all these years.)\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou have grandparents and they don\u2019t. They have two living bio-parents and you don\u2019t. Are they offering to kill off one to make it fair?\n\nMaybe your grandparents would have been more inclined to be more welcoming of your other family if they had thought she was trying to keep them in your life instead of working against them?\n\nShe could have given them \u201cgrandparents\u201d. Surely there are older people in your community who are lonely and would have adored being invited to join your family for holiday meals or even just a regular walk around the park. Instead of demanding favors from people who she dislikes, why not try to be more inclusive and see what can grow?", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mom and step are trying to push your siblings into your grans to have spare time.  \nSoon you'll have 18yo, so, you can live with your grandparents and tell to mom and stepdad to kick rocks.", "NTA sounds like mom and step dad want to unload the 3 kids for a few hours. You're 16 this is a discussion your mom and grandparents need to have. The 3 kids are no blood and your grandparents have no obligation to them", "NTA-It sounds like you know exactly why they are upset with you.  This is how it often works with blended families, one side is jealous that the other side has more (or, in some cases, less) family than the other.  There are, unfortunately,  people in this world who think that they can dictate the feelings of others.  My own experience was that I adopted a child who then became jealous that her now half-sister had a father and she didn't, and the child with a father was jealous that the adopted child got to have extra one-on-one time with me while she was visiting her dad.  Each person in a blended family gets to choose how to define those relationships. Include, don't include, it's pretty much a personal decision.  Based on your mom's history, your grandparents have every reason not to entangle themselves in her life through her children who have no relation to them.  Unless you were being a jerk about it toward your half-siblings (which doesn'tsound like it), she needs to just be happy for you that you do have grandparents in your life.\n \nI hear a lot of parents who get into the mindset that their children should all be equal and everything should be \"fair.\"  These are the same people that brought their child into unfair circumstances.  Your mom thinks that it's not fair that your half-siblings don't have grandparents.  Has she even considered that it's not fair to you that your half-siblings have two living parents in the home raising them?", "NTA.

And including your half-siblings isn't something your grandparents need to do, nor should you feel bad about spending time with them.\n\nJust a thought, would you rather go live with them?  At 16, well you probably could if you wanted and they wanted, sounds like a healthier environment honestly.  Also, have you ever reached out to your mom's parents?  I'd be super curious what they'd have to say and if they'd want a relationship with you as well.\n\nGood luck in any case.", "NTA- do your grandparents have money or something? \n\nYour mom and her husband ramping up their harassment of you sounds like they know time\u2019s almost up (you turning 18) to get your grandparents emotionally (financially?) invested in your half siblings.", "NTA\n\n> and how my half siblings were watching me and seeing that I loved people who denied them.\n\nBecause they have no relation to your mother\u2019s additional children.\n\nI mean, you might as well be upset over a friend having involved grandparents.\n\nDoes it hurt to know you don\u2019t have a bigger family involved in your life?

That means sitting your half siblings down and explaining to them that you have three different sets of Grandparents.  That might mean more attention, a better financial situation for you, or both.  Not your fault that the other three sets aren't involved in any of your lives.  It's your Mom and Stepdad's job to help them navigate that.  They shouldn't be able to block you from seeing your Grandparents unless they give equal treatment to your Mom's children who have no relationship to them, and basically blackmailing them.  They might be able to legally, but they shouldn't morally.", "NTA.

Your mom and stepdad will pit your half siblings against you. It\u2019s going to get ugly \n\nLook up local laws; at 16 you should be able to choose where you want to live and I would see if you can move in with your grandparents. Also a lot of places have grandparent rights, where grandparents have a legal right to remain in their grandchildren\u2019s lives after the death of a parent, so do some research \n\nGood luck, take care of yourself, make a plan and be safe", "NTA. But I think I can get your mom and step dad's wish that they had grandparents. Like, you know how you see other families that have really great relationships with sibling (s), and you yourself don't have that great of a relationship with your sibling(s) and you just wish and long for that? I think it might be that sort of feeling. But they've gone about it all wrong. Your half siblings aren't entitled to a relationship with your grandparents, and your folks aren't either. I hope they grasp that soon", "NTA! Please don\u2019t listen to your mom and \u2018stepfather\u2019- they should not stop you from seeing your biological grandparents.", "NTA", "Can you go live with them? Now?", "Nta they need to stop punishing you. Talk to your grandparents to see if they can say anything to your mom because it isn\u2019t fair to you", "NTA, and I really don't understand why they think your grandparents should be involved with children they aren't related to. If they wanted to, that's nice, but they have no obligation to, and it's more than understandable why they don't want to (they're just random children to them). \n\nDo they just want free babysitters?", "This one hits a little close to home for me. I would not want to be your age again for anything and have to deal with all that stuff over again.\n\nWith that being said, make sure you establish strong ties with your half siblings now and make sure they know that you see that it hurts them to see all this stuff going on.\n\nYour mom and step dad don't sound like bad people or anything like that, but they are trying to force a blended family into a non-blended family where everything is perfect, etc.\n\nSadly, this doesn't usually work out for all the parties involved. If your siblings constantly see you getting gifts, love, etc. from your grandparents while they get the nothing, they will grow to resent you personally even though you haven't done anything to deserve the resentment. This is because through their eyes, they will see you as being spoiled and more loved than them.\n\nOf course that doesn't seem to be the case, but your mom is just trying to make everyone happy and make this family work.\n\nThis may not make sense to you now, but it will when you're older. Make strong ties with your half-siblings now and it will pay off later in life.", "Esh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
