I am 3 months PP so this year we\u2019ve decided to stay close to home (~20 minutes). My sister (37F) offered to watch her for us as this will be our first date without the baby. I accepted and was excited to go out because I just went back to work and I\u2019ve been feeling a lot of guilt over leaving her and dealing with PPD.\n\nMy sister texted me asking if I\u2019d pick up a case for her kids\u2019 (7M and 8M) Nintendo switch since they wanted to bring it to my house.\n\nMe: \u2018wait are you bringing the kids to watch R? I thought you\u2019d just watch her.\u2019 \nSister: \u2018They wanted to come \ud83d\ude2c. Is that not ok? You asked if I was going to...\u2019 \nMe: \u2018I just assumed they\u2019d be with J (her husband) or D(her MIL)\u2019\nSister: \u2018No, it\u2019s a half day and they have haircuts after school\u2019 \nMe: \u2018oh shoot, well let me ask my husband about it\u2019 \nSister: \u2018\u2026.?  Is that a problem?\u2019\nMe: \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were bringing the boys. You never said anything about bringing them so I thought you were just going to come watch her and leave the kids with J (her husband). We\u2019re going to have the dogs in the house and I don\u2019t want them thrown in the backyard the entire time we\u2019re gone. I know J (8M) likes to play with them but J(7M) doesn\u2019t like them at all. Do you think you\u2019d be okay with the dogs and the kids?\nI didn\u2019t get a response back. \n\nI realize there are people that do not like dogs in the house or really at all but I feel like since she\u2019ll be watching them at my house and this is their home they shouldn\u2019t have to be thrown out. My other reasoning for not wanting the kids to come with her is that J(7M) has no manners at all and doesn\u2019t listen. He has no respect for my home any time he comes over and I\u2019ve had to tell him multiple times to stop messing around with decor or my husbands gaming system. They are welcome to use our switch, games or books we have but not the Xbox or ps4 as we don\u2019t have any kid friendly games on either. When they do come over I make sure to have activities out for us to do but he ignores all of them and wants everything I\u2019ve told him is off limits. It would be one thing if she would reprimand him when he doesn\u2019t listen but she thinks he\u2019s perfect. I know kids will be kids but to just let your son do whatever he wants in someone else\u2019s home is disrespectful in my opinion, especially when I set a boundary and she doesn\u2019t enforce it.  \n\n I asked a friend of mine that has kids if it is unreasonable to assume my sister would watch my daughter without her kids since she has a husband at home to watch them and she said I should have expected the kids to come too. So, I guess I\u2019m asking should I have assumed they were a package deal?  Do people bring their kids to babysit at other peoples\u2019 houses? What should I do?", "created_utc": 1703053939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mo2ea/wibtah_if_i_tell_my_sister_i_dont_want_her/", "score": 866, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is a bit of T A, mainly for not parenting her kid at your house. For those saying it's normal 7 year old behaviour: it really isn't.

You have no idea what your daughter will grow up like and you're judging one of your sister's children and how she chooses to raise him. \n\n3. Kids violate boundaries all the time. You haven't described any damage done to your house by this child. \n\n4. What's your priority? Date night or policing your sister and her kids?\n\nSave your energy. Have fun on your date. You're going to have to give up control of your home and many of your boundaries as your child grows up. \n\n5.

Enjoy having a support system that will swoop in and take care of your daughter so you can go on a date and nurture you marriage. Not everyone has this luxury. \n\nI'm not condoning \"rude\" children or \"lax\" parenting but as the mother of a curious son, there's a limit to what you can control in your kids, all children are different, arguing with my son is a waste of time while redirecting or distracting him works better.

I would\u2019ve asked explicitly if I could bring them before I even fully offered. It\u2019s not wild to assume if they never brought up their kids that they wouldn\u2019t be coming. No one here was really an asshole it just feels like a soft miscommunication. I didn\u2019t see any assholey behaviour.", ". NTA \u2014 Absolutely and Definitely Not.  \nThe sister threw in her kids\u2019 attendance as almost an afterthought.  \u2018oh yeah, half day\u2026.Haircuts\u2019.  She should have made clear when she offered that she\u2019d probably be bringing her kids.  I\u2019d want that info out front before I made a decision on that offer. Knowing one of the kids isn\u2019t good around dogs and the other is probably going to be irritating about the gaming systems would definitely be reason enough to want to leave them at home if I was going to be caring for a baby.  I would also think the reasons for OPs hesitations, especially regarding the discipline situation, is not a secret.   Sister must know her child is considered bratty (to use a light term) and not the easiest to manage on his own.  I\u2019d be worried as well leaving a child like that unattended by me in my home.  If sister is tending to the baby, she can\u2019t monitor everything that is happening out of her line of vision.  Kids are good at hiding things , especially when they\u2019ve accidentally broken something when touching what they shouldn\u2019t touch. If she\u2019s worried about one kid breaking stuff and the dogs being outside and her sister\u2019s ability to maintain while watching the baby, warranted concerns or not, she will not fully enjoy her nice evening.  Even if the sister can maintain, PP new baby anxiety will supersede logic anyway.  Why shouldn\u2019t the sister consider these facts? She offered to babysit for a first time away for a birthday celebration outing and should definitely acknowledge OPs hesitation with more compassion or at least mild exasperation and tolerance. With 2 boys you would think she might remember how it felt to leave for the first time.   \nEveryone saying ofc they are expected to go as well must have skipped over the part where there is a husband (sometimes referred to as dad) who is most likely more than capable to keep them a few hours so sister can babysit.  And I find it disturbing that (most) everyone had automatically assumed the kids go with mom regardless of what dad is doing.  He\u2019s a parent just the same.  Moms take kids to do all their everyday things and dad can too. \nI\u2019d also like to point out it\u2019s not entitlement to ensure that you feel 100% about the situation/environment you will be leaving your child in for an extended period of time.  Doesn\u2019t matter who it is or how they are related.  It is true some may not have varied options, especially if having to pay for a sitter is on the table however, if the norm for OPs birthday is going an hour or more away  to celebrate, it doesn\u2019t sound like the ability to pay a sitter would have been an issue.  If they are fortunate enough to financially afford that option or if there were any other avenues was not addressed as part of the issue in OPs narrative. It was only stated the sister OFFERED but bringing her kids made OP hesitate on that after the fact.  Additionally, just bc sister offered, doesn\u2019t make it any less necessary to feel comfortable when leaving and it certainly does not mean the offer has to be accepted when the specifics of what was imagined or required by OP are not in sync. Maybe if sister hadn\u2019t offered, a sitter would have been arranged and then there would be no hard feelings. Just because it\u2019s FREE doesn\u2019t make it better.  \n Maybe have a sidebar with sis and let her know you were hoping for her to come solo.  Just to ensure there were No unknowns to distract you from your special evening.  If she can\u2019t or won\u2019t Idt retracting the acceptance of the offer is in poor taste if you feel that strongly and have other options. \nYour comfort level is important above all else and should take precedence over possibly offending your sister by rejecting the free childcare you never asked for and whoever is calling you entitled bc you have an expectation or can afford to pay for a sitter.", "YTA.\n\nJust wait til your kid is 6 or 7.\n\nJust wait....", "You've opened a big cab of worms, then.

I am 3 months PP so this year we\u2019ve decided to stay close to home (~20 minutes). My sister (37F) offered to watch her for us as this will be our first date without the baby. I accepted and was excited to go out because I just went back to work and I\u2019ve been feeling a lot of guilt over leaving her and dealing with PPD.\n\nMy sister texted me asking if I\u2019d pick up a case for her kids\u2019 (7M and 8M) Nintendo switch since they wanted to bring it to my house.\n\nMe: \u2018wait are you bringing the kids to watch R? I thought you\u2019d just watch her.\u2019 \nSister: \u2018They wanted to come \ud83d\ude2c. Is that not ok? You asked if I was going to...\u2019 \nMe: \u2018I just assumed they\u2019d be with J (her husband) or D(her MIL)\u2019\nSister: \u2018No, it\u2019s a half day and they have haircuts after school\u2019 \nMe: \u2018oh shoot, well let me ask my husband about it\u2019 \nSister: \u2018\u2026.?  Is that a problem?\u2019\nMe: \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were bringing the boys. You never said anything about bringing them so I thought you were just going to come watch her and leave the kids with J (her husband). We\u2019re going to have the dogs in the house and I don\u2019t want them thrown in the backyard the entire time we\u2019re gone. I know J (8M) likes to play with them but J(7M) doesn\u2019t like them at all. Do you think you\u2019d be okay with the dogs and the kids?\nI didn\u2019t get a response back. \n\nI realize there are people that do not like dogs in the house or really at all but I feel like since she\u2019ll be watching them at my house and this is their home they shouldn\u2019t have to be thrown out. My other reasoning for not wanting the kids to come with her is that J(7M) has no manners at all and doesn\u2019t listen. He has no respect for my home any time he comes over and I\u2019ve had to tell him multiple times to stop messing around with decor or my husbands gaming system. They are welcome to use our switch, games or books we have but not the Xbox or ps4 as we don\u2019t have any kid friendly games on either. When they do come over I make sure to have activities out for us to do but he ignores all of them and wants everything I\u2019ve told him is off limits. It would be one thing if she would reprimand him when he doesn\u2019t listen but she thinks he\u2019s perfect. I know kids will be kids but to just let your son do whatever he wants in someone else\u2019s home is disrespectful in my opinion, especially when I set a boundary and she doesn\u2019t enforce it.  \n\n I asked a friend of mine that has kids if it is unreasonable to assume my sister would watch my daughter without her kids since she has a husband at home to watch them and she said I should have expected the kids to come too. So, I guess I\u2019m asking should I have assumed they were a package deal?  Do people bring their kids to babysit at other peoples\u2019 houses? What should I do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I love my pets but people come before animals.", "YTA but that's ok, you can find a different babysitter :) simples", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s a lot of assumptions to make. First of all, if I ask somebody to watch my baby for me, and they have kids of their own the very first question out of my mouth would be \u201c Are you going to bring your own kids?\u201d Or \u201cWhat about your kids?\u201d It\u2019s bizarre TO ME that you didn\u2019t ask. \n\nNow let\u2019s get to your \u201cdecor\u201d. That \u201cdecor\u201d you\u2019re  talking about her seven-year-old \u201c ruining\u201d are multiple game consoles. If I were you I would get used to the idea of \u201cyour decor\u201d being touch or ruined cause your foolish if you believe own child won\u2019t ruin your decor when they become they start walking around and become of age. What will yo do then? Punish the toddler or send them to your sisters house too? Lmao! \n\nLastly, I am all for telling children \u201cno\u201d and setting up boundaries, but you assumption here, is that you would be able to put out a giant bowl of M&Ms, tell children not to touch, then leave the room thinking all the M&M\u2019S will be there when you get back. Just no. That is an unrealistic expectation. If there are things that you don\u2019t want children to touch when they come over to your house, put them away. If not, when you invite that temptation into your home you weep what you sow.\n\nYour sister is doing you a HUGE favor by watching your infant so you can have a date night, when she already has two children of her own. If you want someone to jump through hoops in order to do things YOUR WAY then you need to hire a babysitter and pay them accordingly. But when someone does you a favor for free, then you have to accept that this person will do it THEIR way as long as it\u2019s a reasonable and acceptable way of doing it.", "Let me get this straight - so if her husband isn\u2019t available, you expected that she would find a babysitter for her kids so she could come babysit yours?? YTA. My guess would be that \u2018new mom\u2019 hormones are clouding your judgment here and having you feel overprotective, which I get - I\u2019ve been there. But regardless, this is not a reasonable expectation, and I think you\u2019ll be lucky if your sister offers to babysit again. \n\nAnd yes, in general this is a package deal thing - my kids would be pretty bummed if their aunt came to watch them and their cousins weren\u2019t there, because that is the norm. Same goes for most families I can think of - if the person babysitting has kids, their kids are usually with them. It\u2019s like a playdate/look at the baby/babysit rolled into one. Obviously yours is too young for the playdate part, but still. One of my nephews is also badly behaved and I groan a little internally when he\u2019s over\u2026but that is the trade off to have a free babysitter for a night!", "Babysitter is your answer here", "Nta.

If you didn't want her children with her while she took care of your daughter, you should have make sure that point was clear. If she is usually with her children at that time, and she usually takes them with her when she visits, she might have thought there wasn't any problem, as she is their mother and she was doing you a favour without pay, so it is seen more as a family stuff than a business deal. She might have said \"no\" to doing you this favour otherwise. So YTA for assuming. Make sure next time, so she can accept or refuse with all the information and you can avoid this unnecessary drama.", "YTA. You sound like you just don\u2019t want the nephews around your baby.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry people are jumping you, a first time parent  who has openly stated you have PPD, for having reservations about going out on your first date since you had the baby, with the added stress of miscommunication with a sibling *who offered to help on your birthday*.\n\n\nSibling knows it is YOUR BIRTHDAY.\nSibling knows it is your first child.\nSibling *presumably* knows about your PPD.\nBut the biggest thing people are neglecting to pay attention to is sibling knows *from experience* how much attention newborns need FULL STOP.\n\nShe should be aware that she's doing you a major favor on your special day and that bringing 2 older kids, one of whom is a brat, into a house where she will be, for all intents and purposes *working* will distract from minding the baby she offered to watch in the first place. This isn't a vacation for her kids; it's your house. What are they going to do, play with an infant? Add 2 dogs *that she knows about*, and her kid's relationship with them to the mix, and is a recipe for a stressful night for everyone. \nYou want to enjoy a night out, as does your partner. That's less likely with one it both of you worrying about all of that at home. \nI don't appreciate when a poster offers detail for clarification and gets slammed a making excuses. \nYou've given us all the variables, which are known to your sister due to your closer relationship with her than a forum of strangers. \n\nThe bottom line, without all of that, is that babysitting is a job. You don't assume you can take your kids to fill in a shift anywhere else, so why would you assume she would bring them to your house, especially if you know their other able bodies parent is home. Because if a part of a couple with children makes a decision and commitment like that, they'd be likely to tell their spouse about their plans.  That would give them time to plan unselfishly, since this is for your birthday. \n\nI get where you're coming from.  NTA just need to communicate differently because what is practical to you is obviously not the same to your sis.", "Yta", "YTA, pay a babysitter", "ESH. I\u2019d assume that my sister won\u2019t bring her kids to my house when I\u2019m not around, even if she comes to help because he couldn\u2019t behave at all.

Yours seems to lack all that\u2026  \n\nYour fault is that you expected your sister to act like she has some manners and common sense, she shown you so many times that she doesn\u2019t have those by not discipline her perfect monster when he disrespect your house rules. Honestly, you should ask your husband\u2019s family to help babysit. Your sister is a non-function at this point. It\u2019s not kids will be kids, puppies and kittens can be trained why can\u2019t kids be taught? We speak the same language after all.\n\nMy niece is 7 yrs old but ever since she turned 5, whenever her parents left her with other family members, she behave so well that I\u2019m shocked. If her quota is up, she never ask for more. Her parents have set quota for paid playground visits/TV time/amount of sweets she could have. If she ask for ice cream, she only want one and never ask for more. She said sugar intake must be limited (her dad and aunt are doctors, specialists, no surprise) Whenever she watches paw patrol at my place, she asks me to count the minute. One time her mom picked her up early and she was about 12 minute into the episode, I told her, I\u2019ll tell your mom you\u2019ve watched 10 minute since it\u2019s only 2 minute over and it\u2019s easier to calculate. She told me no \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 she\u2019s like 12 is 12, I shouldn\u2019t cheat. Kids can be taught since early age.", "NAH\n\nYou don't want specific people at your house, especially if they would set their own rules - that's fine. However, the expectation of your sister was reasonable. More importantly, if she comes over, then she has to abide by your rules, but she doesn't have to come over and would not be an AH if she declined. You are not entitled to free baby-sitting services, so if you don't like what she has to offer, then you can simply pay for a babysitter on your own dime.", "NAH I used to sit for my hairdresser every Wednesday evening. On that day, I left my kid at home with her dad. It's not an unreasonable thing to expect that your infant's sitter will be there to focus on your infant. At the same time, it didn't occur to her that you'd have a problem with it. \nMiscommunication happens. Best to clear it up and move forward.", "NTA. \n\nSis should have asked before just assuming it would be okay. I would not allow it either.

If I keep someone's kids, they generally come here because I don't want to bring my feral kids to another person's house and stress about what *my* kids would do to the other person's house.  For me, it is not a big deal to add a kid to the fray in my own space with my large brood. I've been the neighborhood house where kids congregate. \n\nOP, you are new to this.

We don't know that he won't parent his children. We literally know nothing about that situation or that she has to bring her kids everywhere.\n\nBut it's not unreasonable to bring a kid/kids along when babysitting and is something I see pretty often.", "She didn't offer to leave her kids at home, no.", "OP's sister finds it more convenient to watch all three kids, that's really all that matters. If OP doesn't want that, she can decline and pay a sitter instead.", "I've babysat five between the ages of 6 months and eleven, and yeah, adding another one or even two into that mix wouldn't be that much of a stretch. \n\nPerhaps it's a cultural difference - I grew up part of a family where this kind of \"babysitting\" among the extended family was completely normal. Throw all the kids over parent 1's house while parents 2,3,4 go out for the night. Rotate parents on different nights; everyone watches the kids and everyone gets a night out at some point.", "None of that matters. If anything, OP should be even more grateful that her sister is willing to help despite how hard it would be.", "They aren't supposed to touch things but they aren't dogs you can train. At some age, they question the orders you give and if they don't make sense to them, they ignore or struggle to remember them. It's almost like with adults who are given stupid orders (i.e. by their boss).\n\nGirls aren't more respectful of boundaries, they are usually punished way harder than boys (\"boys will be boys\") and are therefore more intimidated.\n\nI just don't think that a family / guest fight should be started about things and who can touch them when they're standing in public areas. That's a weird hill to die on.", "If it's a misunderstanding, OP would gracefully accept or decline now that she understands. She wouldn't be on here being pissy about it.\n\nBut even a misunderstanding makes OP TA.

I'm saying it's not easier to take care of three children rather than one. OP should get a babysitter if she doesn't feel comfortable with her nephews in her house without her.

I understand they\u2019re not dogs, and a house isn\u2019t a public area. Do you think the sister lives by a \u201cboys will be boys\u201d kinda thing since her sons won\u2019t listen about touching certain things? I fully agree things should be put away though, but some things can\u2019t be put away and we don\u2019t know what the \u2018decor\u2019 is.

She's asking if declining makes her an AH and is asking about how to approach it.\n\nJudging her as an AH for a misunderstanding just seems so harsh.

I never met a kid who couldn't stay on the other side of a room with a book or a game while their sibling played with the dog.", "I don't agree that the sister needed to ask to bring her kids. Bringing one's kids is generally a given when you're offering to watch someone else's kid for free. 1:1 care should never be assumed. It's an AH assumption. It's like asking for a gift and expecting something expensive. You get what you get, take or leave.", "Ouf you are so invested,it is a non issue, she can offer to babysit and take her kids with her, she is a mom she might prefer that, she is not bringing strangers' kids with her. If op doesn't like the package deal she just needs to find a babysitter that will probably be paid and will be just a worker who takes care of her child.", "If your trying to watch three kids and get shit done, sure it gets hard.

If you drive they need to be in a carseat, but the carseat lives in the car. I wouldn't go anywhere without a sling, but there's no point giving that to a sitter if the sitter won't use it. \n\nAt this age, they're basically big potatoes. They don't do much, and they don't need all that much either for a short outing. But parents, especially of their first child, tend to carry a lot with them.\n\n(Then again, I say this, and I know for darn sure I never left the house without a bag full of books for the kids! But to be honest, I also never leave the house without a bag full of books for me, so, again, it's a parenting thing and not really a baby thing.)", "Depends.
