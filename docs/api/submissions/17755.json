Doesn't he have any friends he wants to invite?

Is a but unfair a kid that need their parent cant go because their parents cant pay (in my opinion).\n\nBut on the other side, you already are expending a lot in the kids and an just-kids party is about alright. So if you are willing to watch them and be accomodating to special cases, I guess that you are NTA", "NTA, as long as they know before", "This. I\u2019m assuming the kids are young and need their parents there. The party is for the kids, not the adults, so they probably don\u2019t want to pay for themselves to go to your son\u2019s birthday party. I\u2019d plan something else while the kids need their parents around and do this kind of party later when their parents don\u2019t need to come. Maybe have a party for all of the kids and then go see the movie with your son and let him invite a friend (on a different day than the party). Make it more of just a regular play date so the other kids don\u2019t get jealous.\n\nETA: the edit of it being family changes things a bit. I think it\u2019s less AHish if they have to pay for themselves since it\u2019s become a family outing. Since it\u2019s their family, the adults would probably be more excited to see the kids and other adults than if it was random friends and their parents.", "Yeah this right here. If you're going to invite people and plan something like this you should be able to accomodate everyone. It's unfortunate the price is high though..", "Adults can stay without having to pay for anything.

Some of them might drop in for 30 mins and leave the kids. You never know.", "He can ride with an adult in the go karts. It's like a huge trampoline area that he's played on before with other bigger kids.", "This is always tricky. Normally, if you have enough people in your camp to effectively mind all of the children, emphasize the drop off and who will be supervising. I would say if parents choose to stay, the cost will be $xx.xx to do so. Clear and concise. \nIf you don't have adequate child minders, then you have to cover 1 parent per kid/family. Cut that large list in half. No one needs 17 kids at their birthday party to have a great time.\nYou're edit said it's all family. I would pay for a small group to go and have a big family party afterwards somewhere else. Maybe invite a few school friends to the Mario party and do a family BBQ later. $900 is nuts for a kid party unless you're wealthy or saved for the specific event.", "Idk, maybe it\u2019s just because I grew up poor, but that\u2019s perfect normal to me? NTA. \n\nFor birthday parties with family where we actually went somewhere, the invitation was always either \u201chost is paying for kids, adults pay for themselves\u201d or alternatively, everyone is WELCOME to come, but each family pays for themselves and if you can\u2019t afford it, you just don\u2019t come and no hard feelings, everybody catches up later! \n\nNot being able to afford dropping $900 on a huge party doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t give your kid the party they want, and it also doesn\u2019t mean that his family shouldn\u2019t be welcome to come themselves, even if you can\u2019t pay.", "YTA \n\nIt's not customary to ask your guests to pay for themselves. If you can't afford this type of birthday party, then you can have a smaller party, or choose a less expensive option for which 300$ would be sufficient, or have the party at home.

My judgement still stands", "As OP said in another comment, parents can stay without paying anything. I believe the paying is to fully participate in the activities", "I redid the math on the kids and it's 13 children that we will be paying for. It's free to enter but if you want to do activities or play the arcade you have to pay. All of these children are his older cousins.", "That\u2019s a COMPLETELY different story. \n\nKids and lunch are covered \n\nAdults are free to watch the kiddos play! However, if you\u2019d like to join in on the fun or have a snack, you\u2019ll have to cover that yourself.", "Of cource nta, just attended a bday party at such a place and they paid for the kids to do go carts and a times arcade card.

If you plan on watching all those kids alone if parents don\u2019t want to pay to go", "Pay for the children, that\u2019s more then fail.", "It's a family party. The people OP doesn't want to pay for are OP's guests (b-day kid's grandparents and other relatives). OP wants to throw the fancy party at the expense of those guests instead of just throwing a more \"regular\" party.", "This post has nothing to do with judging her parenting style or the type of party thrown. A day at a family fun center is not hugely extravagant imo.", "NTA, but you should scale back the party significantly.  The kids older than 9 or so will not interact much with the birthday boy when there's so much better stuff to do than hang with a four-year-old.  The older cousins are likely to pair up with someone close to their own age & disappear for the duration of the party.  \n\nA party at a pavilion at the park would be much better for a family party and much less expensive.  With the money you save you, your husband & son can go to the Family Fun Center several times.", "NTA just don\u2019t be upset when some of the kids don\u2019t show up. You picked a party that\u2019s kind of pricy. Some may not have the money to come and pay.", "In my little part of the world, etiquette demands that you pay for the invited children only. NTA", "You should have added the bit from the comments to the main body where you explain the fee is just for activities and adults can still come in and supervise regardless of payment. Then no, NTA - the activities are for children, it's a children's party and I don't know how much an adult needs a go on the trampoline or minigolf course.", "My opinion is based on an experience many years ago. My preschool-aged son was invited to a friend\u2019s party at Chuck-e-Cheez. Of course the parents stayed due to the kids\u2019 age. While the kids were being served the hosts asked us if we adults wanted food. She ordered stuff and then afterwards gave us the bill (kids were paid for - not the adults). But we weren\u2019t told until after we ate!\n\nSo my opinion is that you are NTA if you tell adults beforehand, just give them plenty of notice.", "it's pretty standard at play centres and stuff to have parents there just supervising. I have never heard of the adults being included in the games for the kids party, unless occasionally some pay for themselves.   \n\n\nNTA", "How is she the asshole if it wouldn't cost them anything to be there? Can you read? She's already spending $300 on this party for other people's children. The entitlement in this thread is absolutely off the charts.", "The adults are not just there as guardians for the actual guests (the kid's friends), but they're guests in their own right. If invited they should not pay fir themselves.", "You are certainly entitled to your thought.\n\nI base my response on my experience. I\u2019ve two daughters (now grown far past these kinds of parties). Literal dozens of parties either hosted for, or attended with, my kids.\n\nHaving hot dogs and burgers for the gang over? Sure. Feed the parents, too. Heading to something like posted above where there\u2019s fees far and beyond food? I\u2019ve never once seen all the parents paid for - certainly not by myself, nor ever paid for for my own fees when bringing my kids. I\u2019d have never done it, and would have felt odd having it done for me.", "This makes me curious. Maybe it's just different traditions, but just to be clear:\n\nDid you expect guests to pay for themselves, even when throwing a party for your family, invites including grown ups? \n\nWould you put it in the invite that they were invited, but also supposed to pay? Would you expect them to bring gifts?\n\n(I am under the impression that OP expects the adult guests to pay fir their own food too).", "So, it depends. What the OP posted was a child birthday party. These places are all over, it\u2019s like a Chuck E Cheese goes big time. Arcade, but with go karts, little roller coaster, private rooms for eating, arcade, laser tag room, etc.\n\nThese venues often put out a package. Say, $30 per head, gets x pizzas, drinks, room reserved for a couple hours, access to rides for y hours, etc. so you pay for all the children as the host. Bring your own cake. Bring some party favor bags for all the kids attending. \n\nYou likely order some additional food for the adults. But not that big package deal. And not everyone does this, I tended to though.\n\nYes, gifts are in order from the kids attending - you can easily drop $50 per child attending.\n\n\nBut if another parent wanted to go ride the go karts or play laser tag or whatever\u2026. Yes. 100% on them to pay for themselves, I\u2019d never seen it done otherwise. EDIT TO ADD and it doesn\u2019t matter if the adult is your buddy Larry, your sister Betty, or Aunt Matilda. If they want to ride rides with the ten year olds, they paid for themselves.", "NTA - I'm so confused by this thread. I'm invited to a kids bday in a few months and there's no way I'd assume I would have to pay for myself. If anything I'd assume I'd be spending extra so the parents don't have to.", "If this is like where I used to have bday parties for my kids the packages were only for the kids. The parents were never included. We did pay for extra food, appetizers and sodas for the parents table but if they wanted to go on the rides or games they paid for that themselves. A lot of adults wouldn\u2019t want to go on those things anyway. They were happy that the place\u2019s party chaperones were handling the kids while they chatted with the other parents.\n\nNTA."]}
