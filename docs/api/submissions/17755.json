There is a family fun center near me that has go karts and arcades. I discussed with my husband (29M) about having the party there and he agreed. I wanted to pay for just the kids as that would be $300. That would include lunch and the attractions. The attractions are go karts, golf, trampoline park, Lazer tag, indoor go karts, a roller coaster,  and a ropes course. \n\nNow here's where I might be the asshole. I only want to pay for the children. If I pay for the adults to that raises the cost to almost $900. I feel like the $300 dollars is enough because if I were to throw a regular party I would spend that much anyway. The number of kids coming is 17. While the number of adults is also 17.\n\nSo will I be the asshole?\n\n\nEdited to add: this is just a party for my immediate family. My parents and my spouses parents and our siblings.

So if you are requiring a parent per child then yah YTA", "NTA\n\nHad a lot of birthday parties for my daughters. I can\u2019t recall paying admission for something like this for adults, ever. Kids, sure! But their parents? No.", "Info: What is the age range of the children that will be coming? Are they at an age where parents would feel comfortable leaving their children there for you and your husband to watch alone. Can you and your husband watch 17 children on your own or wil you have additional help. I'm not a very trustful person so depending on age of my child I might not feel comfortable leaving them at a party with other adults that I don't know.", "INFO: Wait, there is something wrong here... Why does adding the parents triple the costs? Are you assuming 2.parents for each kid? How old ar these kids?", "How old are the kids? Can the kids attend alone without their parents?\n\nInfo", "Info: how old is your child and the children thats attending", "NTA as long as you are clear up front with the families.  Are the kids old enough to be dropped off and picked up or will you and your husband potentially have to monitor closely 17 kids? Can the 'group' move from one activity to another or will they be running around on their own?  In that case, age matters.\n\nI would be thrilled at the opportunity for my child to attend such a fun filled birthday party and wouldn't mine paying my own admission to help out and watch the excitement and fun.", "YTA.\n\nThis is not a regular party and inconveniencing your guests because you want that regular party price tag is not cool. You should pay for the parents that want to come. It\u2019s called being a good host.", "NTA.  There should be no expectation that you are covering the cost of adults.  Also, why are the adults invited?   Isn\u2019t this a kids party?", "how old are these children ? some parties i have been to in my childhood my parents dropped me off and picked me up afterwards. are you expecting all 17 to stay ?", "NTA - if you tell them before hand it'll be fine, it would be pretty bad if you didn't say a thing and just let them go unprepared, the birthday party is for your son and his friends, the adults are only there for looking out for their children.", "NTA. I usually disclose that kind of info at invitation:\n\n\"This is a kids party, We will cover for the kids, adults are welcome to join at their own expenses, or drop the kids at the locations.\"", "NTA - just make the expectation clear beforehand. It\u2019s not a free day out for the entire family.", "NTA. That\u2019s how we do it around here. If you\u2019re throwing a party like that, you pay for the kids you invite. Any adults or siblings that want to join will pay for themselves.", "NTA - this is a party for the kids. If adults want to play, they have to pay. When we've done something like laser tag or paint ball, we only pay for the kids. Of course, most of the kids get dropped and left there until the end of the party.", "NTA! I mean, is there an option where parents don\u2019t participate but just enter the park & watch over the kids? Or is this more a Six Flags situation? \n\nEither way, if you make it clear on the invitation you are good to go.", "NTA. Adults can pay for themselves if they want to go and participate in the same activities willingly without having duties to watch the kids. Maybe, as a show of good faith, if you could convince 2-3 of the 17 to take a more active role in watching, via participating in the events with the kids, then you might be able to split or cover their portion as a thank you.\n\nThe only thing I do think is...slightly...a hole ish, is the fact that all 17 people at your kid's birthday are his cousins. Doesn't he have any friends he wants to invite? Is this some sort of power play where you are more worried about pissing off one of your relatives by not inviting their kid, rather than supporting your kid to invite whoever they want? If so, you would be an ass, just not \"the\" ass, so far as the subject goes.", "NTA its great your paying for the kids", "NTA.\n\nIf a kid's parent did not want to pay, would their kid still be able to attend under your supervision? I would think because it is immediate family, all the adults would be willing to pay for themselves. Focus on your son having a great time, which it sounds like you are doing, but try not to get upset if some people decide not to come because of the price.", "NTA if the adults can attend without paying. They should at least get a piece of pizza and cake, too. It is reasonable to have those adults pay for themselves if they want to race or trampoline. \nYTA if they have to pay admission.", "NTA. I\u2019m planning a go-kart racing bday party for my son and invited 20 kids. On the back of the invite it says instructions/rules like must were close toes shoes and must be 48 inches tall. \n\nIt also says, if any adult wants to use the adult race track they must check in/pay for themselves at arrival. I have not received one single complaint from any parent/family/friends. My Hubby and a few male family/friends are all putting up $20 bucs as prize for their race (lol) - which they are paying for themselves. \n\nI am ordering extra food than the pizza being provided for the kids in the \u201cparty package\u201d so I am feeding the adults. \n\nAgain NTA", "Nta just let them know, but you may be stuck with a lot of kids by yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For me it would be weird and not cool, but I guess this can be culturally relative (?)\n\nAnyway, you should be upfront in the invitation that the actual guest are the children (adults shouldnt be expected to stay). \n\nBut that they are welcome to stay and if someone wants to/need to be fir their child but cant oay that much, you should offer to help. Is a but unfair a kid that need their parent cant go because their parents cant pay (in my opinion).\n\nBut on the other side, you already are expending a lot in the kids and an just-kids party is about alright. So if you are willing to watch them and be accomodating to special cases, I guess that you are NTA", "NTA, as long as they know before", "This. I\u2019m assuming the kids are young and need their parents there. The party is for the kids, not the adults, so they probably don\u2019t want to pay for themselves to go to your son\u2019s birthday party. I\u2019d plan something else while the kids need their parents around and do this kind of party later when their parents don\u2019t need to come. Maybe have a party for all of the kids and then go see the movie with your son and let him invite a friend (on a different day than the party). Make it more of just a regular play date so the other kids don\u2019t get jealous.\n\nETA: the edit of it being family changes things a bit. I think it\u2019s less AHish if they have to pay for themselves since it\u2019s become a family outing. Since it\u2019s their family, the adults would probably be more excited to see the kids and other adults than if it was random friends and their parents.", "Yeah this right here. If you're going to invite people and plan something like this you should be able to accomodate everyone. It's unfortunate the price is high though..", "Adults can stay without having to pay for anything. The adults I'm inviting are his grandparents and aunts and uncles", "The age range is between 6 to 16 and I'm sure the adults are comfortable they are our siblings and parents.", "Its because it takes up more space and tables", "My guess would be it\u2019s both parents or maybe adult tickets cost more.", "My child will be 4 and the children that are attending are his cousins who range in age from 6 to 16", "Since he's turning 4 most of his friends are at his daycare. I was bringing in gift bags to his friends at daycare on his actual birthday. I'm just worried some of my relatives might be upset that I'm not paying for them but paying for their child instead.", "It\u2019s literally her relatives \u2014 aunts, uncles, and grandparents \u2014 that she\u2019s talking about. These kids are her kids cousins.", "YWBTA then.    It would be totally rude to invite people and then ask them ti pay for their own food/activities. \n\nIt would be different if it was just your kids friends parents sticking around to keep an eye on their kids, but these are your actual guests.", "So are you expecting your parents and sibilings to pay to attend their nephew/grandchild's birthday party? Or are you ok with them just dropping off their kids. Expecting your parents to pay to attend your son's birthday seems wrong.", "NTA if you explain to them that you're only paying for the kids.", "I'm even more confused now. 4? \n\nI remember when I was four, even with it being such a long time ago, and I was big for my age. \n\nNevertheless, at age 4, I was: way too small for go carts, possibly too small for golf clubs, definitely too small for a roller coaster, and actually injured my wrist pretty badly when I jumped on a trampoline with some friends and one of their older relatives, and got completely flipped in the air, landing on said wrist, due to the force of the older relative's bouncing.\n\nWouldn't it be safer and easier to just take them all to the Mario movie instead?", "Regardless of who they are talking about, 17 kids is still a lot. Some of them might drop in for 30 mins and leave the kids. You never know.", "He can ride with an adult in the go karts. It's like a huge trampoline area that he's played on before with other bigger kids."]}
