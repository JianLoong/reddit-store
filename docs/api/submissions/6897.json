But I would be very blunt and have a conversation about her attitude and behaviour towards your daughter and how it isn\u2019t acceptable. That if she continues to comment then she will see herself continually not being included in your future family events. It\u2019s then on her to improve the behaviour.", "NTA- I think you may want to sit down with your sister, with your parents present and outline some boundaries with your sister regarding your daughter. Hopefully your sister will seek counseling for why she is displacing her damage onto a 4 year old- but I wouldn\u2019t have someone treating my kid like crap in my home either and I would not let my parents pressure me into changing my mind. \n\nYour sister needs to shape up.", "NTA - we generally try to have 2 parties for our kids (a friends party and a family party). Generally, I argue that it is important to include family and whatnot but your sister is being an idiot. It should be totally possible for you to be direct and tell her, that she made it clear that she thought that the theme was stupid and that that she regularly makes rude/snarky remarks that justifiably lead you to believe that:\n\na. She wouldn't want to be there\n\nand\n\nb. She'd probably negatively impact the vibe.\n\nShe's talking about a 4 year old girl...princess dress up is kind of a thing.  It has nothing to do with whether or not the kids are spoiled..it's just something that some of them like.  Tell your sister to grow up and stop being shitty toward a little kid.", "NTA. And next time, make sure she *knows* she's not invited.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your daughter decide whom you invite. Both the day and party were about your daughter, not your sister. You could've invited her, sure, and while not doing it is slightly ostracizing, it is absolutely no asshole behaviour as it wasn't coming out of nowhere. Your sister has a few issues which your parents should handle, not you. Your daughter shouldn't have to suffer her shitty attitude.", "NTA and the best you can do is go low contact with your sister. Maybe she will mature one day, but it will probably take a lot of time.", "NTA, your sister needs to seek help.", "NTA, not her party, not her guest list.", "NTA, it's your call whether you want to invite your younger sister or not. However, this is a problem that you need to talk about with her, you don't want this to happen every year, do you?", "NTA. Your sister is the jealous and petty one. You need to have it out with her. Tell her you are done with her childishness and she is to stay NC until she grows up.", "NTA\n\nYour mom and dad need to have a talk with her. She sounds like a brat.\n\nThey cannot keep tolerating her behaviour and brushing it off.  She's 22 for god sake.", "NTA. In reality, you pay for the party, you choose who to invite. End of. \n\nYour sister sounds really entitled and I would honestly try to distance myself from her, so she doesn\u2019t end up impacting your child negatively.", "NTA but she needs to grow up and actually act like an adult. You need to set some clear boundaries with her.", "NTA If i didn't know her age i would guess she is 10. This isn't how a 22 yo should act. Being jealous of a 4yo girl. If anyone is spoiled then it's her. And it's your parents fault. I wonder how would she be in her 30' s and would she still demand all eyes on her. Your parents should be careful about it.", "NTA for not wanting a person who makes those comments about your child on their birthday. Kids pick up on that more than people know, and having an aunt who\u2019s nasty to you can\u2019t be a good experience for the kid.\n\nAlso, you have every right to limit interactions with people who aren\u2019t good to your child specially when she\u2019s this young. You did nothing wrong. \n\nThat said, and this is not your responsibility, but the issue of Anya\u2019s jealousy needs to be addressed. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re comfortable bringing it up to her yourself, or your parents, or someone who might get through to her but this behavior can\u2019t go on like this. It\u2019s been 4 years! Can\u2019t imagine this is the only situation this type of thing happen with her, and it certainly isn\u2019t healthy for her or the family.", "Anya is the AH. I can't believe she's in her 20s", "NTA but there's no way in hell I would sit there and allow my sister to talk about my child or pull faces at her like that, she's 4 year old she's a child, I would be having serious word with your sister and tell her that her behaviour towards your daughter is unacceptable and she needs to get over herself", "NTA.\n\nShe is 22 and she still behaves that way? Wow, that girl needs help.\n\nNext year, be very explicit to your parents and sister that you are not going to include your sister, if nothing has changed by then. 5-year-old birthday girls should feel like they are the most important person of the day and that everybody loves them, just for who they are.\n\nLife will damage them soon enough, you don't need bitter jealous spoiled 22-year-olds for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister has a problem with the lack of attention that she needs to deal with. She is the one that is spoiled unfortunately your parents had a lot to do with that. She is going to have to grow up and understand that taking things out on a child is highly inappropriate. I will tell you from personal experience, these things stay with you into adulthood. I'm 44 years old and I still remember snarky things that happened when I was a child. I am not close to those individuals to this day. I would not want my child around somebody who treated them that way. Children pick up on vibes very easily. You did the right thing. But I would not have allowed her to come. Especially for her to sit around and say things like that at your daughter's birthday party.", "NTA. It's really immature to be jealous of an innocent kid. She's 4, wtf, is that really what your sister wants to be known as? \n\nI saw someone calling the kid spoiled because she didn't eat her nana's food and I can't say I agree. I am not a kid person, at all. But from a psychological standpoint forcing kids to eat can be really bad. Please don't create terrible relationships between your kids and food. We all have likes and dislikes, why should kids be force fed stuff they hate? Disliking something doesn't make them spoiled.", "NTA. It might be time to sit down with her and your parents and tell her that if she continues to make remarks like \u201cspoiled princess\u201d about your daughter, especially when your daughter is present and can hear her, that she will no longer be in your daughters life. At 22, she is old enough to know how to behave, and if not, then it isn\u2019t your job to shield your child from a jealous aunt. Making sure you do it with your parents present will keep her from twisting the story and making it out to be worse.

Anya wasn\u2019t \u201cjust a teenager\u201d when the baby was born - she was 18, ffs. Any adult petulant enough to refuse to stay in the same room as a baby or throwing a hissy fit because they\u2019re jealous of the attention being given to the baby should be told to pound sand until they can get their shit together. It\u2019s in no way \u201cunderstandable\u201d that she behaved like this, and her more recent actions make it clear she hasn\u2019t matured nearly as much as you think she has.

A big statement without saying anything to her sister. Which was leaving her singled out.
