Our parents were obese and didn\u2019t teach us anything about portion control or healthy eating and pretty much only fed us fast food. By the time we reached adulthood, we were both obese and addicted to fast food.\n\nIn college, I continued with the unhealthy habits I had learned, but I was miserable. I was tired all the time, had no energy to go out, got out of breath walking to my classes, and couldn\u2019t fit in a desk. One day I took a leap of faith and went to my uni gym. I made small tweaks to my lifestyle, and while my initial aim was to lose weight, I realized that eating healthy and exercising made me feel more energized regardless of my size, so I continued. Through college I went from a size 22 to a size 8/10 and started powerlifting. Now, I am married to a fellow powerlifter, and we have two kids who we are teaching to intuitively eat, and providing with types of food from carrots to cookies. I\u2019m not thin and I never will be, but I\u2019m strong and healthy and my kids will be too.\n\nMay took a different route from me in college. I can\u2019t entirely blame her for this, as we\u2019re four years apart in school and people were starting to embrace \u201cwoke\u201d culture. While I used the small desks as health motivation, my sister joined a student activist org to lobby for desks for \u201cstudents of size.\u201d While I attributed my lethargy to weight and unhealthy habits, she blamed \u201cweight stigma.\u201d She spent college partying, drinking, and eating junk food and gaining 100 lbs. I visited her during her senior year and she couldn\u2019t walk two blocks without keeling over. I tried to intervene because I didn't want to see my younger sister die before me, but just called me \u201cfatphobic.\u201d After a few years of this, which included me paying for therapy, gym memberships, meal plans, begging her to join me for walks, etc, and her telling me to f off, I gave her an ultimatum. I would finally stop bugging her about losing weight and changing her habits, but if her health and mobility ever got really bad, I was not going to help her in any way.\n\nFor a couple years May and I hardly spoke, but a couple weeks ago I got a shocking call from her. She quit her job because it was too hard mobility-wise, and she was also struggling with basic hygiene. She asked if she could stay with me for a while and I said absolutely not. We had made a deal that if she didn\u2019t make changes to her lifestyle I was not going to help her. I\u2019m *not* going to turn my house into May\u2019s nursing home, especially since I have two kids to care for.\n\nMy husband is backing my decision, but word got out to my family and I\u2019m getting bombarded with texts calling me TA for \u201cabandoning\u201d my sister. They say since my husband and I are well-off there is no reason for us to not take care of her. I think it\u2019s a bit much considering I told my sister years before that living with me was not an option, and she has other family to go to, but I\u2019m very curious about what y\u2019all think.\u00a0 Am I TA?\n\nUPDATE 1: A lot of people are asking whether my sister is committed to making changes now or not.

Your success is your success and it\u2019s really rich of your family to say that you should take care of your sister because you have the means. By that logic, they should be jumping up to help too.\n\nYou can be body positive. You can be accepting of all bodies. However, you have to accept the limitations that come from accepting your body and the choices you make that create it. Your sister has to pay the pied piper and that\u2019s not your debt to bankroll.", "NTA. Coming from someone who grew up with a similar unhealthy relationship with food, you obviously care about your sister. You tried to help her in many different ways. She knew where you stood. Anyone who complains can volunteer their home and caretaking duties to her.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is only 28.  You don't want her to be your dependent for the next 50 years.\n\nIf your family members want, they are welcome to financially support your sister.  But you don't have to enable her.", "NTA.  May knew the terms.  If your family members are so opinionated and upset by your choices, they should be happy to welcome May into their home.", "NTA. I find it funny how other family members are bombarding you about it but they aren't volunteering to take her. Let them take her if they feel so bad about it.", "NTA.\n\nTo each and every one of these family members calling you TA, simply respond \u201cso, she\u2019s moving in with you right?\u201d.", "NTA and really, the food issue is secondary. Your sister sounds like an addict; she went from being a functioning addict to a non-functioning addict. You cannot enable her\u2026that is not helping. She needs to admit she has a problem, and help herself.\n\nAll the family members who are angry you\u2019re not taking her in are welcome to take her in themselves, but I guarantee you they won\u2019t. They know it\u2019ll just lead down a path of her taking advantage of them, and using them to feed her addiction. That\u2019s what will happen to you if you let her into your home.", "Definitely NTA, you tried your best. Just because you are well off does not mean you have to take care of your sister.", "NTA. You have tried to help. And congrats on changing your lifestyle to the better and for helping your children about what is healthy and what's not.", "NTA", "NTA. Its unfortunate you both were not given the right nutrition and habits from the start but it is her choice to not make any informed changes as an adult.", "NTA\n\nFirst let me put out there I'm currently morbidly obese. I've struggled with my weight my entire life. Currently my inability to lose it is largely due to an unrelated issue. I have never been one to expect others to go out of their way to accommodate me because of my weight. In fact I tend to wish it was still as hard as it use to be for me to be overweight.\n\nIt is possible to be body positive and encourage people to lose weight. Being healthy is the goal, not looking a certain way or weighing a certain amount. Today's culture of political correctness has gone a step too far in this regard. \n\nYou set a boundary. You sister agreed to that boundary. The consequences for HER actions are not YOUR responsibility. See those key words. That's what matters.\n\nThe consequences for my actions if I remain at this weight and fitness level will be exactly that. Mine.\n\nFocus on you and your family. Let her reap what she has sown and if your extended family can't acknowledge all you have already done to help your sister, step back from them too.", "NTA. She made her choices. It is one thing to be overweight, but still be able to move and do things, but if you get to a point where you can\u2019t work or bathe, and blame society that is a whole other story. She took things too the extreme. but please don\u2019t judge everyone who is \u201cwoke\u201d by this standard. She is taking things to the extreme to excuse her life choices, but the majority of people I know that would consider themselves \u201cwoke\u201d are not extremes, they just are trying to have an open mind.", " Stick to your promise. If she moves in she will never leave. And the trauma of your kids having to watch their Aunt slowly die from obesity would be horrible for them. Let another family member deal with her or a  hospital.", "NTA. It sounds like you worked really, really hard to change your unhealthy path and succeed in life. Your sister had the opportunity to do the same but instead has chosen to become dependant on others. Hopefully she sees this as her rock bottom and gets whatever help she needs to get healthy.", "NTA - Your 2 kids need to be your focus.  Everybody in your extended family is awful.  They know from every television show that if she spent one night in your house it would be impossible to get her to leave.  At age 28 there is still time to change but not if someone like you shelters her from ALL the consequences of her lifestyle.", "NTA\n\nIf she's unable to care for herself it's time to apply for disability and get a visiting nurse.", "NTA she chose to put herself in this position. You did more than your duty, you dont owe her this.", "NTA and I admire your success and your sticking to your boundaries, that you established well in advance.\nBut I have a question (or 2), if I may.\n\nDoes your sister maybe want to change now? And might she feel, that you could help her, as you have successfully managed to change, too? Then it might be possible for you to say - start to get healthier, work out, do something and I will be there for you (which you did in the past, but then she wanted and accepted no help. Plus you shouldn't be the one to pay for these things). \nOr does she just need a caregiver and is not wanting to change? Then you are absolutely right, a hard no. \n\nAs for the family members calling you an asshole now - what have they done to help your sister or yourself get healthy? Are they willing to take her in? Probably not, or they wouldn't be so pissed at you.\n\nAnd last but not least, your partner and children - what do they think and say? It would be a massive burden to care for your sister, even if she wanted to get better. And it would probably take a long time for her to be self sufficient again, depending on how much she actually weighs and what other health issues may have ensued.\n\nOP, congratulations on YOUR success. You have come a long way yourself, and as an ex-addict (sorry, I am not sure how else to call it), it must be hell to have the very things you got away from in front of you every day.", "NTA - your sister is an adult and made her choices. There are others that can take care of her (namely all the family members calling you an asshole). You tried to help her and she decided to play the victim instead of putting in the work like you did. You have your own family to take care of, not someone that makes no effort to care for themselves.", "NTA, stand strong OP. Tell anyone who bugs you to take care of her. They can take turns.", "NTA, as I always say in this kind of situation: all the family that have guts to tell you you must help your sis, coz you are family - should start of by showing an example or simply fuck off.", "NTA - you've already tried to help her and told her what your actions would be if she didn't change her lifestyle.\n\n> are well-off there is no reason for us to not take care of her.\n\nOh my, the old 'but your family' AND 'but you have the money' cards!  Just so many times this sub see's these lines come from other family members who also don't want to lift a finger to help!", "Nta the rest of your family can help her.", "NTA.

I\u2019m a heavy guy who discovered CrossFit about 6 months ago and I\u2019m nowhere close to my goal weight but I\u2019m enjoying the benefits of healthier habits, and can\u2019t wait to see where this takes me.", "NTA. You have yourself and you own family to consider. Her situation is the result of her own decisions. You tried to help, but it was rejected. You don't deserve to become her carer. It sucks for her, but maybe this will finally be the wake up call she needs. She's already had way too much enabling.", "NTA. If the family wants her cared for, they can do it. You tried to help her with her addiction (and that is what she has, a food addiction) and she refused. It makes no more sense to care for her than if she were a junkie or a tweeker.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA she\u2019s an adult who left her job without having another one lined up and refuses to take care of herself and get healthy. If your family feels so strongly they can take her.", "NTA- No point in helping people who'll NEVER help themselves.", "There is a huge difference between being overweight despite doing everything you can to be healthy and being overweight because you live an unhealthy lifestyle.  Certain conditions do make it near impossible to lose weight : PCOS, thyroid issues, and genetics to a certain degree.  Also, certain medications do cause weight gain and that can't be helped.  From what you've described, the morbid obesity is simply due to bad diet and inactivity and using the \"woke culture\" as an excuse to keep down that path.  I would maintain the same stance as you.  I warned you, tried to help you, you chose to be this way and it really was an active choice.  You are no longer my problem.  I love you but no.  The flying monkeys can arrange care for her if they are so supportive on her unhealthy ways.  If you want, you can leave the door open saying if she shows signs of trying to change her unhealthy habits, then you will help but she has to take the first steps to improve on her own.", "NTA, do your family members know about the deal you made with her? I bet they don't, they only hear the story you won't let her live with you. Your sister made her own bed, now she has to lie in it. She knew in advance that there would be consequences, but she did not care. Let someone else worry about it, you worried plenty :-)", "What\u2019s her plan for when her heart gives out?  To complain that the clog in her aorta is fat phobic?\n\nIf you take her in, you\u2019re going to be taking care of her for the rest of her life and it\u2019s probably going to end up as one of those situations where someone needs to literally wipe her ass for her. She takes absolutely no responsibility for her actions or condition and instead just points fingers at others as if that will make it go away. \n\nIt was never worth it to her to take care of her own situation, so how can anyone argue that it should be worth it to you to burden your family with caring for what is likely to be totally dependent on you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Baby sis bathed them, fed them (cooked), cleaned, drove them to all their doctor appointments and spent the last 8 years living with our mom who suffered from dementia.  She was also diagnosed toward the end with Alzheimers  as well.  Mom was paranoid we were trying to kill her or were trying to steal the house and put her in a home.  She was suspicious of everything and everyone.  Baby sis took the brunt of her anger and frustration.  I told my siblings that if not for baby sis, mom and dad would have been in a home and probably have died much sooner. \n\nMy siblings have no idea how much work it was for Baby sis to care for them.

There is burn out because many of us come into this profession to help people but it becomes exhausting because 99% of the time people don\u2019t help themselves and it becomes a revolving door.

Sticking to boundaries are important but it\u2019s also possible to help a loved one while also not enabling them. OP could offer to help by:\n\n- hiring a nutritionist for sister to help sister make a nutritious meal plan, shop for it and stick to it\n\n- buying weights and doing workouts within the sisters abilities day-to-day (something the sister can do while sitting while she slowly works to get mobility back), or buy one of those treadmill or biking machines made to do while working (so you can sit normally while doing it taking some of the strain off) \n\n- check in and visit with her to celebrate the small successes she\u2019s able to make, help her find hope for the future \n\n- hire a personal trainer who specializes with obesity\n\nThat\u2019s if she\u2019s willing to of course and maybe she\u2019s not. But if sister is motivated now and doesn\u2019t receive any help (doesn\u2019t sound like she will receive help to change from any other family considering how she was raised) she may die from this, OP stepping in if and while the sister is motivated could save sister\u2019s life.", "It's utter ignorance when people conflate body positivity with \"health at every size\" like this. The obesity epidemic has been going on for decades now and it's proven shaming people for something they're fully aware of every minute of their life isn't effective. \n\nI get people look at all fat people the same way and think \"they just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps or else they're stupid\" but not every health journey is the same for overweight or obese people. If this post is even true and not a strawmanning troll then it's clear OP's sister needs therapy to unpack her relationship with food and exercise. Psychologically it's not always as easy as going to the gym (where people will gawk at you) and making consistent linear progress. \n\nWe seem to understand that with drug and alcohol addiction, smoking, but society continuously treats obesity like a moral failing and not a byproduct of a myriad of personal and societal factors.", "Yup. PCOS over here and while my lifestyle changes haven\u2019t shifted my weight one pound, boy have they improved my health. Having troubles conceiving my first kid and then getting gestational diabetes was a wake up call. So I started seeing a personal trainer twice a week and a dietician twice a month. My periods came back, I\u2019ve lost inches off my waist and decreased my body fat percentage. I\u2019m one of the strongest woman at my gym now. And when I tried to conceive my second, it happened literally the first month trying. \n\nBMI is still at 35 right where it was when I started. So encouraging someone to get healthy isn\u2019t always the same thing as encouraging them to lose weight. But OP is NTA for not wanting her sister to live with her.

A very close friend of mine is severely overweight.  She has the ultimate trifecta though, PCOS, thyroid issues and has to take mental meds for depression and anxiety.  She always uses that as her excuse to not be overweight but once you see her portion size it's a face palm moment.  If you ask her about doing physical activity it's either her gout (which is because of her weight) or her asthma (which is worsening because of her weight) as to why she doesn't do much of anything.  She's even been told point blank by her doctors that she is causing her own health issues but refuses to change.

Yes, diabetes is associated with higher weight; higher weight makes the body be less responsive to insulin, but also being less responsive to insulin causes weight gain. So did the early diabetic symptoms cause the fat, or the fat cause the diabetes? Literally nobody knows.\n\nThe same is true with nearly every medical condition that\u2019s correlated with fatness. Bad joints: if you have bad joints, you can\u2019t move as much, which can cause higher weight which can affect your joints\u2026so which came first??\n\nWeight is blamed for a laundry list of conditions, but if you look, practically all of those conditions also list \u201cweight gain\u201d as a symptom. That means technically they don\u2019t know if the condition is causing the fat, or the fat causing the condition.\n\nAlso just as a side note: while size isn\u2019t a measure of worth, neither is health, and it\u2019s ableist to suggest otherwise.\n\nALL of that being said, in this particular case (though not overall), OP is NTA.

I found the only way to make it work for me was to hire accountabilibuddies. I won\u2019t work out on my own, so I have to spend the money on a trainer who expects me to show up. And knowing I\u2019m going to have to tell my dietician how my eating has been over the last two weeks keeps me on track too. It\u2019s so fucking expensive. But it\u2019s my health, so whatever, if money exists to buy anything it\u2019s to buy well-being.", "This is not an accurate comparison.\n\nA person can live without ever consuming alcohol or drugs.

But it is questioned how much of the effect is from being fat, and how much is from the added stress of being discriminated against for being fat, including medical discrimination. But I don\u2019t think HAES developers ever said obesity has no effect on health at all. \n\nHAES was developed as a weight-neutral approach to health as an alternative to the mainstream approach of \u201cthin at any cost.\u201d Many fat people have been indoctrinated with the message that the only way to be healthier is to be thin, any behavior that results in weight loss is healthy, and any attempt to be healthier that does not result in weight loss is failure. Whereas HAES says healthier habits are the best predictor of better health whether they result in a \u201cnormal\u201d BMI or not. Exercise and better nutrition can improve every health metric from heart health to sleep patterns to mental health, even if you never lose a pound. \n\nDoes that mean it won\u2019t be even better if you do lose weight? Of course not. But focusing on weight loss is unhealthy and likely to fail for a lot of people because it\u2019s so caught up in self-punishment and body hatred. \n\nWhereas the mentality of \u201cI\u2019m incorporating  more vegetables into my meals because they taste good and make me feel good\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk because I enjoy being out in nature and it feels good to use my muscles\u201d is more healthy and more sustainable long term than \u201cI don\u2019t deserve food because I\u2019m so disgusting\u201d or \u201cexercise is my punishment for being fat and if it hurts I deserve the pain\u201d which is what diet culture promotes.", "Not sure but I thought a part of HAES was also related to removing inherent bias from doctors. A lot of times basic health parameters are neglected if you look slightly overweight. Docs would just say lose weight as if every symptom was related to weight. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t cause health issues, but I think the preconception that it\u2019s only weight was something the movement wanted to tackle. Happy to stand corrected here though", "She may well be active but if she's obese then she's eating too many calories. The bloodwork will be fine until it isn't.

It's not a surprise that you start adapting to the food of the area (after all, isn't this what lactose tolerance is...?)\n\nUntil very recently, the vast majority of the world never made it a few hundred miles from where they were born.
