{"id": 31014, "submission_id": "17vr7z5", "title": "AITAH for refusing to talk to my parents after moving in with my 30yo Partner at 18?", "selftext": "I (18f) have always had a very bad relationship with my parents. I am the second of four siblings and we live in a closed community, the kind that everyone knows everyone. My relationship with my mother is better than my father, but still. Since 15 years old I have been staying with my grandparents in the city due to educational reasons though I would visit my family almost every weekend. The (30m) son of some very close family friends (let's call him \"Nick\") had recently gotten divorced, he and his wife had two kids though the oldest one was not his. His parents and all of his siblings are very close friends with my parents and since a young girl I've had an innocent crush on Nick, which I always blames on my daddy issues, because I understood that it's weird to crush on someone close to your parent's age. After he got divorced, him and I became a bit closer behind the scenes. We never really spoke much with him (I mean, come on, I was his friends' daughter), so it's not like he got divorced because of me or something like that (don't get me wrong, I'm not a home wrecker) but after the divorce he had started talking to me more and we got very close. So close that it eventually became intimate. After I turned 18 and while I'm still on school, I moved in with him without telling anybody about my whereabouts because I knew what a fit my parents would throw due to being strict. I knew my father would probably call me a slut like he had done when I was 13 for reasons that weren't even true and he would make me feel like shit again, but I don't care because I love Nick. At first nobody knew about us and my parents and relatives were looking all over for me but since I was legally an adult I told them that they have no right to invade my life. Long story short, our families found out about us and everything became a mess like I had predicted. Everyone came on to Nick (his parents, his siblings, my parents) but I kept out of it because I wasn't talking to anyone so they couldn't reach out to me, but I understand that it was wrong to leave him Dela with this alone. After many, many arguments things between him and everyone else are good, in fact better than they were before because he has explained to them that he loves me and my parents apparently think he can \"fix me\" or something like that, which I don't mind. Ever since, Nick has been trying to convince me to get in touch with my father, and I refuse even though my father has come to terms with the whole thing. I'm slowly getting in touch again with everyone else, but I strictly refuse to talk to my father because I had dreamed about the moment I could completely shut him off of my life, in other words when I would turn 18, and I just don't want to hear anything he has to tell me because I hate him with all my might.

Your relationship may be legal, but it's immoral on his side and he knows exactly how vulnerable you are and has taken advantage of that.", "OP, this post is going to be deleted, because it describes grooming. Nick is not a good man. A good man does not \"get close\" to an underage girl, nor does he get intimate with an underage girl.\n\nThe tone I am picking up from your post is that you think you know everything; you think you're so mature because you had a difficult childhood, you think you're so wise and worldly. Bluntly? You're not. You are barely more than a child. He is a grown man. What he has done is terribly wrong. He is taking advantage of your naivete.", "Girl,\n\nI've been there\n\nI'm crying for you\n\nRun", "Chances are Nick was attracted to you since you were 15. Am I right? You said you had a crush on him. He certainly noticed. \n\nHe got divorced from an adult woman, with whom he had one kid and one step-son.\n\nBut now he can turn to a vulnerable 18yo, from a troubled family, who'll worship his opinion, status, money and jokes. \n\nNo equality, no fight for custody, just sheer good time with young skin, a naive teen, who'll ignore all the reasonable advice of not dating someone almost twice their age. \n\nYTA and your parents are right this time.", "You're legally an adult and can make your own decisions. However, you're also right that the decision to move in with Nick was fueled by your daddy issues. A thirty year old man who enters into a relationship with a teenager, especially one he's known her entire life is a predator.  You'd be better off seeking therapy.", "Nick is a predator who's grooming you. All the shit with your parents aside, the relationship with Nick is not good.", "The title says it all. Your \"partner\" is a creep and YTA.", "Yuck, but you were groomed. What type dusfunctional upbringing did you have?", "All I can say is good luck.", "Specifically on the issue of going no contact with your father, you are NTA.\n\nHowever, like most other people, I would express concern about the age gap in your relationship.  At the moment, Nick seems to be doing and saying the right things, but please be careful.\n\nWhat I would suggest you do is \n(1) work on maintaining a good relationship with other members of your family, including your grandparents and extended family.  Visit them, call them, whatever.  What you want to avoid is any implication that you're cutting your family off because Nick wants you to.      \nAlso (2) continue focusing on your education and gaining financial independence.  If you were planning to go to college, don't stop these plans because you're in a relationship.  You need to be able to earn your own money, have your own bank accounts etc.  Even if Nick is the larger income earner right now, focus on studying and then developing a career.\n\nAnd (3) you talk about 'daddy issues'.  Please see if you can access therapy to help you unpack your childhood. \n\nBe wary about any suggestions, hints, manipulation etc form Nick to have you become a SAHW.   That's one of the things that people are super concerned about.", "NTA your an adult you can do what you want.  You are a stupid kid though. Lol I hate this subs bias towards women & blatant men hate, but even I gotta admit this guy is a wierdo. This is in fact grooming.  You were literally attending high school when you moved in with this guy. \n\nLol he switched out his wife for a barely legal teen. The battered women brigade are going to rally behind this one.", " no you\u2019re not an ah. Just try to understand the situation that you are getting yourself in and understand the responsibilities that are going to be expected of you. If things don\u2019t go the way you expect have a plan to fall back on because you might not be able to contact your parents for help if things go south. Look up financial abuse prevention programs. Work and Save some of your money for emergencies because you don\u2019t want to be stuck in a situation where you end up homeless on the street after the honeymoon phase is over. Not saying that is what will happen. I am saying You really don\u2019t know a person until you live with them. Everything is cool when you\u2019re living apart without responsibilities and the day to day stresses of life. Wish you the best of luck.", "Goddess take the Wheel! Let me tell you, if you were my child and this happened, a mushroom cloud would have risen over my city. You are not an asshole, because you're barely an adult, but your \"partner\" most definitely is and your parents as well due to their treatment of you that probably made it very easy for this grown man to take advantage of you. Since I have to put a judgement I will say ESH, but you suck the least because you're just a kid with a crappy family.", "OP here. Just to clarify something, we didn't become intimate per se before I was 18, he didn't perform any illegal actions on me, we just spoke about different things that I did completely consent to, and I gave him the green light to continue. I do understand the viewpoint that it is weird for a 30yo man to be close with a 17yo though. But like I said, nothing illegal before 18.", "All these comments about grooming etc are utter bollocks! I married my husband when I was 18 and he was 39. We had a fabulous marriage until his untimely death (following an car accident) Just because there is a 12 year age difference DOES NOT make him a predator!!!

There is the one who gambled away $100,000 and they divorced? Or their current husband who they spent ages pick rings out with, whose ring they hate and wear a cheap one that he hasn\u2019t even noticed? And apparently is rude to and inconsiderate to retail workers. Referred to in present tense. So maybe 3 marriages total? Cause honestly all those sound shit and maybe shouldn\u2019t be role models for OP. Plus they say they are an alcoholic, again maybe not something for an 18 year old to emulate. Maybe they are in denial or just doing a little light trolling. Praying for the latter."]}
