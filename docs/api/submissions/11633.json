My old housemates dude would try to make himself right at home when she wasn't there - making sandwiches, watching TV - I snapped and made my feelings known. \n\nHe wasn't paying any rent or even bringing food or drink treats for the house when he was there.

However, I have to say he does keep to himself for the most part. He doesn\u2019t settle into the living room like you said - which is why I feel like an AH for saying anything at all.\n\nBut when I work from home on days he\u2019s there, even if he\u2019s just in her room hanging out, it\u2019s just \u2026weird!

What does your rental contract say about extra people not on the lease moving in?", "All guests should leave when their host leaves; you ain't gotta go home but you can't stay here.", "NTA. you\u2019re well within your rights to feel comfortable in your home and this is perfectly reasonable request. They might be trying to stealth move him in.", "NTA. Tell her he's not allowed when she is not there and if that's a problem for her, you can get the landlord involved. Oh, and she'll need to start paying more of the household expenses as his presence is causing them to increase and you will not be paying any part of his responsibility.", "NTA.  He isn\u2019t on the lease or paying to live there.  The hard part is you need to at least start out gently with your roommate.  Maybe something such as, \u201chey, I keep running into your friend here after you have left.  I feel uncomfortable having one of your friends here consistently when you are not.  Obviously if it was a one time thing because someone was visiting from out if town and you ran out for a moment, but that\u2019s not how it is happening.\u201d", "NTA yea its her house too and she can have guests but if she wants to let them stay there when shes gone she can find a place without a roommate. \u201cits my house too\u201d only goes so far when youre living with other people. i 100% would insist that if shes not here he isnt. you are so in the right for this, i\u2019d be fuming", "Agreed.  I negotiated this very deal with a roommate once.  She had some childhood trauma related to sexual abuse, so we both agreed that no one\u2019s BF would stay behind if one of us left for more than 15 minutes.", "He just started staying after she\u2019s left for work. For a while he was sleeping over and leaving in the AM, or watching a movie with her then sleeping over and leaving in the AM\u2026it\u2019s weird to me that this has started all of a sudden. \n\nI also know he hates his own apartment so\u2026there\u2019s that", "Yeah I mean I would have just loved to have been asked! I feel like an AH saying this but\u2026if she had asked me I would\u2019ve probably approved of it\u2026", "That\u2019s not your problem that he hates his place tho! Does he not work? I\u2019m confused how he just sits all day in her room..while she\u2019s working and you are sometimes working from home. NTA it is odd", "Agreed. Except, once the roommate leaves, he\u2019s no longer a guest.", "This.\nYou don't stay if you're friend or significant other is leaving unless everyone is cool with it.\n\nI have one friend who gave me a key to his house and I just come and go as I please.  But that's situational and definitely not the norm.", "NTA he is there to spend time with her - if she's not there, he needs to go.  He doesn't live there or pay towards any of the bills, he can't just hang around like that, even if you all were close friends.  Given that you barely know him, you have every right to feel uncomfortable being left alone with basically a stranger.", "NTA. I predict you won\u2019t be able to say something to them about this without getting shit on. Therefore, when is your lease up? The easiest way is move out for reasons \u201cnot related to them\u201d. If that won\u2019t work, consider splitting the rent 3 ways, or just tell her you do not want to live with a male, you are uncomfortable, and this has to stop.  He shouldn\u2019t be there if she is not.", "NTA. If he's staying there that much and without his GF, he needs to al least pay rent.", "NTA. Not by a long shot.", "NTA - and please don't ask your roommate that he not be there when she isn't there.  Tell her!  Tell her you can't believe she would let him be there when she isn't, that as another said - a guest leaves when the host leaves.  Put the ball in her court as it belongs.", "You're NTA for saying that. What you're saying is that it's not just about the situation in a physical sense per se, it's about that your roommate didn't communicate with you about it. Some people don't realize that it's about making the courteous gesture.  \n\nI mean, my wife and I do this with each other even in our marriage. For example, she buys a cereal she likes, and if I want a bowl I ask her first, even though it's \"ours\" rather than \"hers\", I already know she doesn't mind if I have some, and if she's not home for some reason and I have some without \"permission\" she doesn't care. But it's just nice to the other person to let them know that their needs, wants, and boundaries are being recognized. This applies even more to your tolerating a near-stranger in your home that you didn't invite.", "Had a roommate give boyfriend his own set of keys so he could come by anytime between sales calls ( this was well before COVID/ Zoom & work from home). Came home early from work one day, looking forward to having the place to myself for a bit with the other two roommates being out, but nope. Walk in to find Greg on the couch in the living room watching tv and having a snack. I went to my room, took a breath, then walked into the living room and told him he had to go. I explained that as I pay money to live in the apartment this also included rare moments to be alone in the apartment and to move around and use the conveniences as I pleased, without having to share space with someone I did not agree to live with hanging out on their own, without the company of their host/ the associated roommate.\nTell this guy and his bowels to take a hike, and stand strong!", "NTA, I would be a little nervous about this myself as a woman. I think you\u2019re pretty chill being fine with him over a few nights a week (which is awesome!) and this could be a great compromise - he can come over as long as she\u2019s there", "Who's house is it? Do you both pay rent? Are you both on a lease? If it's a renal and both names on the lease then no, you have no room to tell her her guest cant stay. Just like she would have no room to tell you the same. If you own it out right and she is paying rent then it's your house your rules. Need more info.\n\nNAH... Yet.", "Totally not the AH for saying that! She should have asked if you were ok with it first! I also was super close with the roommate by this point and we would do stuff just the two of us without my husband. He was my date to a wedding of a mutual friend when my husband couldn't make it lol. We still do stuff together like movies that my husband has no interest in. Still would never assume that I could just stay at an apartment that wasn't mine without asking first!"]}
