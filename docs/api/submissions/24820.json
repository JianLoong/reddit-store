She is your wife, shouldn't she know more than anyone else in the world about you and your life? She was comfortable enough about your relationship to open it, but for some reason, you are not comfortable enough with her for her to open it, and that probably feels insulting to her.

Parcels are the same - if it\u2019s addressed to my husband I won\u2019t open unless he was expecting something and asked me to. I think it is the intent behind the action.

They're married - most married couples open each other's mail all the time.

Does that mean if the person is on an extended trip for some reason, the bill doesn't get paid? No, it gets opened by the other spouse and the lights stay on. Credit card scams are also addressed to 1 person - you can't open a credit card in the name of multiple people, only in 1 person and then add a person as a registered user. So it's junk mail, gets opened, double checked as junk, and then thrown away. I can guarantee you the wife has been doing this for the last 8 years. \n\nMost married couples do this.
