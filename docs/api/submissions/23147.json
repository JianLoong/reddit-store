A long weekend fishing maybe?", "NAH: But I wouldn't be surprised if you ask and he tells her ending with him saying nevermind we'll stay home. \n\nTake a second.....would you leave your wife at home?", "For Thanksgiving? YWBTA to ask him to come without his wife for Thanksgiving. Invite him to come for a long weekend that's not a holiday. Preferably when she has other plans.", "It would be an unreasonable request. Sorry kiddo you WBTA. They've been married 15 years. \n\nNo matter what, Holidays are not the time for you and dad to try to reconnect.  Maybe pick a random day, like Labor day? And invite just him up to your city for the long weekend? Put him up in a hotel?  \n\n\nHolidays are family time and it sounds like you and your wife aren't family any longer.", "YWNBTA and prepare to hear a strong negative reaction. He has spent 15 yrs with this women, who behaves poorly in your company, and if he agrees initially it will likely change before he departs. This, paired w/ his health problems, suggests he is comfortable with her behavior and if he privately disagrees about how she acts when you are around this period of time is a mere sliver of his lifetime (no offense). Suggestion: If you decide to visit him in his city suggest neutral public venues where she may temper her behavior. This has worked for families I know who struggle with similar dynamics. It also keeps your visit short. You can secure a few short 3 to 4 hour visits in different venues over two days. Best to you.", "Send your father an invitation for a solo visit (you offer to pay transportation expenses). If he declines, you know how the future will be.\nTo get what you desire it may be necessary to fly his wife to solo visit her adult children. Or variations on this theme.

YWBTA.\n\nIs there something that your father likes to do that his wife doesn't? If there is, invite him for that on some non-holiday and have it be father-daughter time.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI understand the dynamics are hard and it sucks. Asking a married person to leave their spouse behind for a family-related holiday is a bad call. \n\nFind another time and ask him to visit without her. A non-holiday may give you some more room as it doesn't have the same family togetherness expectations.", "No you wouldn\u2019t be the AH. Maybe you want time with your dad alone. She could use that time to spend time with her own children.", "Info...is she not allowed to answer phone calls and can only talk to you and your wife when you visit? If that is your expectations, I wouldn't be very nice either.", "NTA, I hope he goes and I hope your evil stepmother stays home", "NAH (between you and your dad) for asking.\n\nY W B T A if you got upset or demanding if he decided he was unwilling to make the trip without his wife of 15 years.", "Here\u2019s the main takeaway from this: Thanksgiving will be in your home and that gives you the authority in this situation. If they stay with you and she\u2019s rude to you then you are perfectly within your rights to tell her to find some manners and behave herself under your roof.", "YWBTA if you \"told\" him to leave his wife home on a holiday.  YW\\*N\\*BTA if you floated it as an option.", "Idk if I'd go as far as to say YWBTA, but it would be a pretty unreasonable request imo. That's his wife. He's obligated to spend the holidays with her. \"Ditching\" her would make him an asshole. I doubt you would appreciate a request from someone to attend their holiday gathering but leave your spouse at home.\n\nThat said, I do have sympathy for you. I know how troublesome bigoted relatives can be, and the problems they create for everyone else in the family who want to spend time together without them.", "Don't let her come. She's going to ruin a nice time with your dad and she'll ruin the memory. Dont let her", "NTA but try a different date.  I wish I had done that with my dad. Similar situation.with his jealous, ignorant demanding wife. Problem is he''d choose to be weak, deny it and let her rule. You'll have to ask him to be bravely independent \"be the man\", say tell her you're allowed to spend time with your kids etc. But she's been indulged and is used to manipulating him now. To even have the conversation with him, you'll need a private chat which you probably won't get.\n\nIf she visits, ask \"are you being deliberately loud?\", \"Are you attention seeking?\", \"Are you trying to interfere with dad enjoying time with his family\"?, \"Are you trying to manipulate dad with a jealous tantrum?\" Etc. She answers no of course, then you say 'good' and leave it at that. (Strategies for PA people: call out their behaviour with a question they'll want to deny, then say ok or good). \n\n Try to have an escape space to go to if she facetimes. Usher dad into a car quickly and go to a cafe...good luck", "NTA", "YWBTA - letting political views get in the way of family. If everyone thought and voted the same then there would be no point in having elections.  Unless we are talking full on neo-nazi then it shouldn\u2019t even be a consideration.", "This is the way to go.", "Right? I'd love to see OP's reaction if they were told to leave their spouse behind for THANKSGIVING. \n\nI totally understand not wanting the stepmom around, and that's totally valid, but on a holiday like that.... I'd take considerable offense and probably go LC/NC. And stepmom would likely encourage that."]}
