One of the keys to a successful marriage is navigating each other's foibles and pet peeves.\n\nWhy the heck do you feel so strongly that kids need to be served first AND the biggest piece -- even at the expense of causing strife in your marriage?  You're the AH because that seems like a trivial and low cost give to keep the peace.\n\nWhy the heck does he get so angry about not being served first or given the biggest piece?  Yes, he's an AH for getting so angry about being served first, but I do wonder if there is more here than just what's happening at dinner.  Perhaps he's feeling less that respected in the family dynamic in more ways than this -- only you and he will be able to iron that out together.\n\nI'd recommend getting a therapist involved.", "NTA, and you should have made him clean up his own damn plate.  He wants to throw a tantrum, he can deal with the consequences.  Also though, I'd be thinking about whether this is the example you want set for your daughter, and I'd consider leaving over this.", "This has to be fake. How weird.", "NTA but do you want to live the rest of your life with this dynamic?", "I certainly hope this is fake bc seriously \n\nfirst off who serves their family? are you a waitress?\n\nEveryone even a 6 year old can get food on a plate for a family dinner, your eldest child aka hb temper tantrum is wild.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESH", "I don't know what to vote on this, but if my husband took a plate of food that I cooked for him and served him, and threw it on the ground...I would go back to being a single mom. Is he always so misogynistic and disrespectful to you? A rational adult could have had a conversation about this because, yeah, it does make more sense for the 6 year old to have a smaller piece, but he does not deserve it for being \"a man\" and your child does not need to bring something to the household to deserve food. I hope this is fake.", "NTA\n\nyour husband is doing a sexism", "ESH- I'm assuming your daughter is normal sized for a 6 year old, so she absolutely does not need the biggest portion of anything, especially compared to a full grown adult. However, your husband is acting like a toddler, pouting, then throwing his plate because he doesn't like your behavior. I feel bad for your daughter, her parents are a mess.", "I'll go NTA but really I think there are aspects of E S H. Your husband seems misogynistic, like he has some dated ideas of being the 'man of the house' or being enthroned as the leader who deserves preferential treatment, and the idea of being competitive with his daughter is kinda crazy and effed up. BUT, she is 6, and he is a grown man. It defies logic that she should have the biggest piece. Even if you're thinking about the next meal as well, she can have leftovers for lunch the next day either way.\n\nSo in terms of the order of being served, in my opinion that doesn't matter and it would be better for all involved if no one was paying attention to such petty aspects of the household. Your husband is being incredibly childish and petty. But he's kind of right that she shouldn't get the largest portion, and it would be a simple adjustment for you to stop giving her the biggest piece. \n\nBut also maybe consider therapy or something. This suggests some underlying differences in values and philosophies that seem like they could really rear their head later.", "Why do you need to serve him at all?  Does he not have two arms to make his own plate?\n\nNTA\u2026 he really needs to grow up and be a man and not act like a spoiled toddler", "ESH", "NTA.

You are NTA - red flags on him", "ESH. Women, ffs, why do you keep marrying overgrown toddlers?", "Hey! ESH! Except your child. Give her the amount she can ACTUALLY EAT and set aside small leftovers for her lunch.\n\nYou and husband need some counseling. Get your shit together.", "ESH, what on earth. Your husband cannot manage his emotions and you cannot figure out how to portion food appropriately for your family. Your daughter is a child, she has a small stomach and a small appetite. She should be served portions of food that she can eat in one sitting, if she's still hungry feed her more after she has finished. Your husband is an adult, he has an adult appetite and his food portion should reflect that. Your daughter's meal for the next day should be its own portion that you put in a container and stick in the fridge instead of putting on her plate the night before.", "ESH.  Him for his absurd and concerning behavior, you for giving a 6-year-old more food than a grown man because she \"deserves to have it\".   Or, you could have two smaller pieces so that she eats one and has one leftover un-chewed on.\n\nY'all have some issues that need to be worked on.  I hope you feel safe as throwing the plate to the ground and you having to clean it up is concerning for the possible extent of the anger issues here.", "Please be aware your husbands behaviour is a major \ud83d\udea9\n\nIt might just be throwing a plate now, but he might escalate to throwing things at you or worse. This is not just about who gets served first and who gets the bigger piece, it sounds like he sees himself as more important than both you and your child and is quick to resort to violence. Be careful.\n\nNTA.", "This is such a weirdly contrived account.  What 6 year old 'saves leftovers for tomorrow'?", "NTA! I do find it odd that you give your 6 year old the largest portions though. 6 year olds need kid size portions not adult size portions and if some of it is for lunch the next day that piece should be kept aside and not on her dinner plate for food safety reasons. \nYour husband tho is a massive red flag! I wouldn\u2019t tolerate that kind of behaviour from my kid let alone an adult. He needs to grow the feck up and quite throwing toddler like tantrums. And the comment about your 6 year old contributing to the household is alarming to say the least. \nThat kind of thinking and acting is not ok at all!", "Maybe the way he is acting as a child will make you change your mind and have him served first.  Honestly his childish behaviour about this all makes him an AH but if your serving your child continuosly bigger portions they can't eat until later and he is leaving dinner hungry then ESH.\n\nDo you think any of this could be from other issues in your relationship.  He really seems to want to be known as the man of the house.", "ESH and you guys all need some help.  \n\n\nServing the kid first is fine; it's reasonable to give a bit of preferential treatment to a 6 year old.  \n\n\nGiving the biggest piece to a 6 year old is a bizarre choice; \"she deserves it\" and \"she can save it for lunch\" ignore the fact that the average 6 year old eats significantly less than the average adult. There's no reason to not serve her a portion she's likely to eat, and serve your husband a portion he's likely to eat.  \n\n\n\"I'm the man of the house\" is cartoonishly chauvinistic, and his asking what a literally 6 year old \\*does for the household\\* to \\*deserve\\* food is both cruel and very, very strange for this modern world.", "YTA.

Do you really want your daughter growing up thinking this is normal?", "YTA- man's should always get the big piece of chicken.", "ESH. Your husband for throwing his plate on the ground and acting like a spoiled child. You for thinking that a 6-year-old needs a bigger serving than an adult. If you want to save some of her food for your daughter's lunch the next day, divide it in the kitchen; there's no need to give her a huge serving and put half away after it's already been on her plate. And she's old enough to learn that it's polite to serve adults at the table before children.", "ESH except daughter, y\u2019all got a seriously messed up dynamic in your house though. Why can\u2019t husband serve himself? Why are you treating daughter like a little queen? It\u2019s all very weird.", "ESH you daughter doesn't need the biggest piece of chicken, she's 6. You can give her a small piece of chicken for dinner and another piece for lunch. You and your husband are both AH for being held to such antiquated and childish ideas. You for putting your child above your husband and him for even thinking he needs to be served. I think your daughter and husband are both at an age where they can bring their own places to the table.", "ESH. Your daughter getting served first is fine. Giving her the largest piece of everything isn\u2019t because she\u2019s a child and can\u2019t eat all of it in one sitting. And once the food has been eaten off of, with her actual mouth, it\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be re-served for lunch the following day, especially with no way to heat it up. You can get seriously sick that way. Your husband, however, is a straight up AH and needs to check himself. Acting like a spoiled brat and throwing his plate/ giving you the silent treatment isn\u2019t how a grown adult should act. Tell him to grow tf up and use his big boy words.", "You need some professional help within your marriage and your husband\u2019s anger.  Him throwing the plate and you acting like everything is okay the next day is insane.  Forget the chicken.  Worry about this", "ESH\n\nInfo - is this his child with you?  Bc you don't say our daughter ever.", "NTA for no other reason than your husband is acting less maturely than your 6 yr old.  Your reasoning is sound, he doesn't seem to have a reasonable argument and is acting like a petulant toddler.  \n\nIt cannot be too unusual though.  My dad mentioned a few years ago that his parents got divorced for pretty much the same reason:  Grandfather thought he should be served first and Grandmother thought that the kid should be served first.  Grandfather pitched a fit about it.    This would have been around 1946 in Germany--my dad is 85 now, so was about the same age as your daughter.", "Well... NTA... but you guys need to talk more.\n\nOn his part: \"Leaders eat last\" (great book too)\n\nOn yours: You cant always put your child first. If you do... what's the point of having a husband? \n\nThere is a fine line here that makes me believe it's not about the chicken. These types of behaviors probably follow you in your other daily activities.", "You have a strange relationship with your \"husband\", he acts like a child and you let him.\n\nServe people the size they can eat.", "ESH.  For one, your reasoning sucks.  If you know your daughter isn't going to eat the whole thing, then you shouldn't put it on a plate.  That's how eating disorders start.  Make her a plate with the amount she'll eat, and if you want to save some for her lunch, then set some aside from the beginning.  Also, if your husband is leaving meals hungry, then y'all need to relook at your food budget and shopping.  \n\nWith that said, he sucks because come on dude, get up and make your own plate.  You're a grown-ass adult.  And you certainly don't need to throw a tantrum because you don't get your way.\n\nYou're wrong to give your daughter food you know she won't eat, but your husband sounds like he's working his way up to domestic abuse, so... yeah, you probably want to work on that.", "A bit overdramatic? Everything you described is awful, childish behavior. He's jealous of his six year old daughter. Throwing things is a huge red flag, it won't be long until he's throwing things at you. I think you've lost all perspective on what normal is.", "ESH.\n\nThat's disrespectful towards him.", "[deleted]", "NTA and how could you even think you are?  Hubs is a giant baby.", "ESH  \n\nYou do not love your husband at all.\n\nOnce the child came into the world, he didn't just take second place.  He took no place.\n\nYour husband was childish for throwing his plate.\n\nYou both need help.\n\nIf this continues, you will soon be able to serve your child all of the food, because your husband will no longer be there.\n\nThat may be the best for everybody.", "ESH except the daughter, and weighted more heavily to the husband.\n\nDo you really not hear yourself. You \"just feel\" like she should be served first  so you do it and ignore your husband if he says anything? To the extent you give justifications for things you do, they're in that form. A bad \"my way or the highway in all things\" attitude. \n\nBut....he's throwing his plate on the ground in protest? Seriously? = (The \"man of the house\" thing is a bit silly, but presumably he has a much bigger appetite than she does. Besides, if she's eating part of a piece of fried chicken and the rest the next day, it'll have had her saliva on it for most of a day. Gross, potentially dangerous)", "ESH, but mostly your husband.\n\nYour husband is 100% in the wrong for throwing his plate on the ground, saying \u201cwhat does she do for the household\u201d about his 6yo child, saying that you need to fix your moral (this isn't a moral situation and the fact that he think that is worrying) and saying ''As the man of the house''. That make him the bigger asshole here no matter what.\n\nNow I also think you are kind of an asshole for 3 things.\n\n1) Giving the biggest piece of chicken to the 6yo child is weird. Obviously a grown man will eat more. I mean it's fine if he doesn't want more food or if you give him two smaller pieces, or if he want to eat more side dishes, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, you just gave him less food. Leftovers are leftovers, you make it out of whatever is left, giving the bigger piece to the child because of that is nonsensical.\n\n2) Your husband angry response certainly didn't came out of the blue. You said it yourself ''My husband protests against this sometimes, but I always shut him down'', so this is clearly a regular issue and instead of having a discussion with your husband to get to a compromise you just shut him down. Maybe he have good reasons, you ignored him for years and he exploded, or maybe all his demands were childish. That doesn't excuse his reaction, but yes ignoring the regular protest of your partner is not a good idea.\n\n3) There is something weird in the way you talk about all of this. You are talking about a situation about your husband and child, but it's your daughter, not ours. You serve the child first because that's the correct way to do it. You give her the biggest pieces because she deserve it. I'm not sure how to explain it and maybe I'm imagining things, but it very much look like it's you, your daughter and the other guy over there that just happen to be your husband.  Maybe you mentally checked out of the marriage because of some of his behavior, maybe he is overreacting because the situation is just the symptoms of a bigger problem in your couple, probably a bit of both.", "you have to be kidding me. NTA and fricking leave. hes an adult with two hands who can serve himself. please leave him. you and your child deserve a man not a child", "NTA. Full stop.\n\nWho gets served first may warrant a discussion. But your husband is acting childish and needs to set a good example for your daughter.", "Info  are you a sahm", "I think you are spoiling your kid and setting her up tor food issues. However my biggest issue is with your misogynistic husband.", "ESH\n\n\"He then threw his plate on the ground and I had to clean it up\"\n\nThat's a childish response and very alarming.  Husband is an AH and has anger issues that need to be addressed.\n\n\"I always serve her first\"\n\nPerfectly fine.   No problem.\n\n\"I gave my daughter the biggest piece.\" + \"I  gave my husband the second biggest piece\"\n\nNo.  I do the majority of the hard labor around the house in addition to my share of the chores.  I have the biggest appetite.  I get the biggest piece.  Period.  This isn't open to debate or discussion.  You're also an AH.\n\nEdit: removed some words for the more sensitive readers.", "ESH except your daughter. Your husband was an AH for how he acted, totally uncalled for. However, always putting your kid first isn't great either...how will your child learn patience, what happens when she is no longer a child but an adult? If you continue down this road you might end up with a very demanding spoiled teen and young adult who feels her needs should always come first because they always have.", "Y\u2019all need some therapy", "ESH to some degree.  Your husband's behavior was poor and unacceptable.  He literally threw a fit and that not a good example at all for your daughter.  For you to have to clean up after him after his fit is not at all okay. He should clean up messes he deliberately makes.\n\nTo give your daughter the biggest piece doesn't seem right to me.  She doesn't need that much food and you shouldn't be presenting her with more than is appropriate for her meal.  I'm not even sure I'm okay with her learning she always deserves the most either.  I do get your wanting her to be well nourished, but think this is not the way to go about that.  I also think it could encourage overeating which is a big problem in this country where obesity is a true national health crisis.\n\nYour husband's having this \"discussion\" in front of your child is unfortunate and should never have happened.  He needs to learn a more constructive and respectful manner of talking to you about things he thinks are not right.
