{"id": 3378, "submission_id": "z6awxw", "title": "AITA for not wanting to get a new tree topper?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a black mother of two 12 year old twins and I remarried my husband in the summer so it\u2019s our first Christmas together. It is important that my husband and his son are Caucasian. \nAnyway I was putting up our Christmas tree and decorations because it\u2019s time and it\u2019s the last Sunday before the kids get swamped with finals and we like to do it together. I asked my husband and stepson if they\u2019d like to join and they said yes. \nNow as we\u2019re putting stuff up my husband starts making commentary on how everything is black. I have little black nutcracker ornaments and statues and we have a little Christmas village full of black people. I shrugged it off and we kept going until it was time to bring out the angel tree topper. It was a black angel and my husband stopped me and pulled me to the kitchen. He said we couldn\u2019t have all these \u201cblack\u201d decorations when we were now a mixed family and that we had to go and get some regular nutcrackers and people for the village as well as a regular tree topper. \n\n\nThis is where I might come off cold but I said no. No discussion, just no. I told him that if we ever left this house, him and his kids would get to see regular decorations and tree toppers and Santa and all that stuff outside but my kids wouldn\u2019t get the same and the least they deserved was to walk into their house and see decorations that looked like them. Plus it took me a really long time to find all my decorations and I was going to give them to my kids when they moved out. So no.\n\n\nHe said I was being selfish and unwelcoming and that it wasn\u2019t fair for his son to have to leave the house to feel like he belonged. I told him it wasn\u2019t the same and he asked me to explain how but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to have such a heavy discussion so I just shook my head and told him to read a book. I don\u2019t know, was I too harsh? Should I go get some non black decorations? Will this really affect my stepson negatively? I don\u2019t want him to feel like he doesn\u2019t belong but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even possible. AITA?\n\nEdit for the most asked questions. My step son is 10. We spent Christmas together but never at my house because I usually spend it with my family. My kids and I did Christmas at my moms and then I would go be with him that night. I\u2019m hosting Christmas this year because my mom says I\u2019m finally married again and so it\u2019s my turn. He didn\u2019t have any decorations at his apartment and when I asked he said he just wasn\u2019t a big decorations guy. Also yes he did say \u201cregular\u201d that wasn\u2019t inferred. That word is straight from his lips to this post. Also when he said \u201cwe need to go out and get regular decorations\u201d I don\u2019t know if he meant as replacements or as a add on but I took it to mean \u201cas a replacement\u201d to make his son more comfortable which is why I shut it down immediately. He went out with some friends tonight so I\u2019ll see if we can have a conversation about it when he gets back.

I\u2019m a white mom married to a white man with white kids. But I feel it\u2019s important that my kids have books and dolls (and yes, even tree ornaments) that represent different \u201cregular\u201c people, because this idea that white is the norm and everything else is something besides normal is not a mindset I want my kids growing up with. If your husband wants to *add* ornaments that represent your newly blended family, I suspect that you\u2019d be ok with that.

I guess Black people aren\u2019t regular? Imagine feeling excluded on the basis on your race, that\u2019s insane. /s\n\nA white kid likely wont suddenly feel ostracized from one tree with different decorations, and to claim as much is very strange. Perhaps your husband has some of his own biases that need addressing. If he\u2019s concerned about having his son feeling welcomed, then that is a conversation he needs to be having with him instead of relying on his own feelings and assumptions.", "**INFO** \\- there is some stuff that is *potentially* troubling, but also *potentially* not troubling. My verdict hinges on two issues I would like clarification on, issues I think OP left somewhat ambiguous. \n\n* First, what exactly was his actual ask? Is he asking you to get rid of all of your black ornaments, statues, and tree topper to replace them with white versions? Or is he saying you guys need to supplement your existing exclusively black Christmas swag with some white nutcrackers and whatnot as well so his kids see decorations they relate to, same as yours relate to the black decorations? \n* Second, how exactly did hubby present his case? How much did you paraphrase vs quote him directly? What was his actual word choice, is this consistent with a broader pattern of his behavior in the marriage, what tone of voice did he use, etc.? \n\nI see two possible options - \n\n1. Worst case, hubby is being somewhat racist and giving off semi-controlling \"I'm the head of the house, and we do things MY way!\" vibes. **Demanding** all decorations be **replaced** with **normal** ones is problematic. Here, I would say N T A. \n2. Best case, hubby is looking just out for his biological kids, the same as you are with yours. You want yours to see black figures normalized as angels and wise men and whatnot, and he wants his to see white figures that they can closely relate to used as a positive decoration. He doesn't want to replace your stuff, but wants to *supplement* your existing decorations with some white ones to proudly display how a mixed family can be normal and something to be celebrated. Within this category, there are two subsets. \n   1. Hubby used seriously problematic language like \"normal\" to mean white, but is out of character for him, and he really did mean well, but perhaps has a bit of a lead tongue. Worth a convo about the normalization of whiteness, but in this scenario he was just a good guy trying to do good who flubbed up when he tried to turn his feelings into words. Not everyone is a wordsmith. \n   2. Hubby *didn't* use that exact language, and OP was paraphrasing. In which case OP sorta did him dirty. Hard to say which it is from this post. \n\nFor both subsets of option 2, I would say soft Y T A for not seeing this from his perspective. He is a father merely trying to look out for his kids the same way you are. If this is true, then yes you are being selfish and somewhat uncaring. It's not just about \"what types of decorations will they see at other people's homes,\" it's about **\"*****what decorations do we feel are worthy of putting up in MY home?*****\"** \n\nHere you have failed your stepkids. Either way, you should actively go out and get some white decorations to augment what you already have. The tree topper I would say keep, but depending on how it is made it might be possible to merge it somehow with a white one for a double angel topper. For instance my family uses a white cloth angel, it would be lovely to sew a black angel so they are holding hands at the top of the tree. IF it is possible to join them of course. Not every tree topper is made of material suited to such thigs. If not, meh. Keep what you got.", "NTA\n\nDoes he not have any self awareness over what he is saying? He just told you you and your kids shouldn't feel welcome at any of the shops and other public places decorated for Christmas because they never have anything but white people depicted.\n\nI swear some people are so accustomed to the entire world representing to them and being everything's target audience that they respond to anything else like its a personal attack somehow.\n\nIts like he thinks white is the default race.\n\nI would compromise with additional characters for the ornaments and Christmas village, but honestly the angel on the tree would be my hill to die on. Maybe I'm petty but every other angel your kids see will be white, and 90% of those will be blonde. And frankly if he clings to \"representing the household\" logic, its 3 vs 2 so the angel should be black.\n\nIf it matters, I'm a blonde white woman.", "Info: was he wanting to completely replace all the decorations, or buy some in addition to your black decorations?", "Did he seriously use the word \u2018regular\u2019?\n\nHoo boy.\n\n(And there\u2019s the \u2018we need to\u2019 when he means *you* need to because otherwise he\u2019d just go buy some decorations, right?

Making your home his and feeling welcome and loved. And I say...take off the angel and replace it with a photo of your new wonderful family. Make that a topper.

You can still place your tree topper somewhere else as a decoration. You don't have to pack away your decorations just incorporate new ones.

It is important that my husband and his son are Caucasian. \nAnyway I was putting up our Christmas tree and decorations because it\u2019s time and it\u2019s the last Sunday before the kids get swamped with finals and we like to do it together. I asked my husband and stepson if they\u2019d like to join and they said yes. \nNow as we\u2019re putting stuff up my husband starts making commentary on how everything is black. I have little black nutcracker ornaments and statues and we have a little Christmas village full of black people. I shrugged it off and we kept going until it was time to bring out the angel tree topper. It was a black angel and my husband stopped me and pulled me to the kitchen. He said we couldn\u2019t have all these \u201cblack\u201d decorations when we were now a mixed family and that we had to go and get some regular nutcrackers and people for the village as well as a regular tree topper. \n\n\nThis is where I might come off cold but I said no. No discussion, just no. I told him that if we ever left this house, him and his kids would get to see regular decorations and tree toppers and Santa and all that stuff outside but my kids wouldn\u2019t get the same and the least they deserved was to walk into their house and see decorations that looked like them. Plus it took me a really long time to find all my decorations and I was going to give them to my kids when they moved out. So no.\n\n\nHe said I was being selfish and unwelcoming and that it wasn\u2019t fair for his son to have to leave the house to feel like he belonged. I told him it wasn\u2019t the same and he asked me to explain how but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to have such a heavy discussion so I just shook my head and told him to read a book. I don\u2019t know, was I too harsh? Should I go get some non black decorations? Will this really affect my stepson negatively? I don\u2019t want him to feel like he doesn\u2019t belong but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even possible. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a white man, he doesn\u2019t understand he is at the top of the food chain, so to speak. As a white woman myself, I try to pull some elements from sexism that we all as women have experienced, and I think that helps a bit. But I will still never fully understand what it is like to live with the racism that others experience simply because of the amount of melanin in their skin. I talk with my friends who are POC and listen to their experiences, and that is also helpful, but I would never be so arrogant as to say I get it because I never will fully get it. \n\nI would tell him he is free to put up his own tree, decorations, whatever but you are sticking with what you\u2019ve got for your kids. He can bring whatever elements of his own culture that he\u2019d like to into your shared space, but it doesn\u2019t change your culture. I also think you need to take him somewhere he is completely out of his element. Somewhere that nobody is like him. Let him experience that, let him be really uncomfortable, and let him stew in that discomfort for a long while.

Maybe approach it that way with your husband - say you want to make sure they feel like this is their Christmas, too, but you don't want it to be about race and you're hurt that's how your husband saw it. \n\nThat is just a gentle suggestion.

For example would you forbid them from putting up a menorah (though this applies regardless of their culture, not if they are Jewish in particular. I just used Jewish as an example).

Calling white decorations for Christmas regular is definitely very racist and you should rethink your marriage with him if this is how he thinks of black people.

That perhaps that you should reconsider and make the decorating of the tree to be one that could be a mix to represent the 2 families coming together.

Maybe her tone came off as harsh, but she wasn\u2019t lying about what the kids see when they walk outside.

There was a legit family meeting to decide if we wanted to use Grandma's Angel or the star my mom had because they thought it might hurt me not to have my \"childhood star\".

He was saying they had to go get \"regular\" decorations immediately (which come on it can wait a few days or even a week). \n\nOP's post comes across as defensive of the work she has done over the years to find decorations that her children could see themselves in.

If we had to suck it up and see it most of our lives, it really ain't such a big deal if the roles were flipped in ONE d*mn household. She is NTA at all. \n\nThis clearly is something she really values.

The husband and commentors are talking about the race of Santas, angels, and nutcrackers, but race aside...it sounds like OP really thought nothing should change about her Christmas tree, even though ornaments tend to reflect families and their family is different this year. Baby's first Christmas ornaments, photo ornaments of the kids with Santa, ornaments showing different family member's hobbies...those are all pretty standard. By not having anything that reflects stepson, it's a pretty clear message that *this isn't his home* and he's just a visitor. \n\nThat should have been dad's focus, not just that the tree topper angel wasn't white. :|", "Yup. Reminds me of the time my husband took my son to the barbershop to get his haircut and a white guy popped his head in and asked the barbers if they cut \u201cregular\u201d hair or only black hair. My husband said his jaw fell to the floor.", "I was thinking the same thing! Where did she find non-white decorations?!  Those must be so hard to find and good for her!", "I think adding some \"White\" people to the village makes sense.  Heck they could add some Asian too.  Just to be diverse.  But yes, I too thought it bit rude, esp. as Angels tend to be significant ornament for the tree.  \n\nIF hubby and his son want to be \"represented\" then they could go out(not wife) and buy some of those photo-ornaments that you can tuck photos in.

Did he leave all his decorations with his ex?", "I was thinking a real representation of angel would solve the issue. Like 6 winged with no face visible. Or eyes all over their bodies.", "I'm surprised they made it to married. Based on this he sounds like the kind of guy that says he isn't racist, but is totally unaware of things like privilege and microagressions and thinks you have to be holding klan meetings in your basement to be a racist.\n\nHe wants the woke points of having a Black wife without doing any of the work that comes of being a white guy marrying into a Black family.", "Sure he could have meant a star but the rest of the conversation kinda kills that idea. \n\n\" He said we couldn\u2019t have all these \u201cblack\u201d decorations when we were now a mixed family and that we had to go and get some regular nutcrackers and people for the village as well as a regular tree topper. \"\n\nIt pretty obvious that by regular he meant \"white\".", "Why doesn\u2019t dad have his own Christmas ornaments if Christmas decorations are so important to him? Because he didn\u2019t care at all about decorating for Christmas until he saw all the black decorations, and then he threw a fit.", "The thing is, if the husband wants that so badly, he needs to go out and get his own \"regular\" ornaments himself, instead of demanding *she* does it.\n\nEdit: sorry, I guess he said \"we\" need to get some, but he really should just do it himself if it's that important to him.", "So he was a Prince nutcracker? Waaaaaant", "This us hilarious.", "Yes! I also just went to Lowes and they have a black realistic Santa animation (he waves and goes \u201cho ho ho!\u201d!) and they had some Christmas gnomes and nutcrackers who were black also!

I don\u2019t want to offend!", "POC have lived with white Christmas decorations forever and we're fine. It's not like the decorations are literal representations of each family member. I just find it funny how this is normal for us to not be represented but it's a meltdown for a white person. I remember it being a *huge* deal when my mom found a Black angel for our tree because they were extremely hard to come by as a kid. Just like it was a big deal that my Barbie comforter set was Black ballerinas. If you've never had that experience, maybe sit in why you just have to have white decorations.", "I mean..it sounds like his father didn't even decorate before. He clearly brought no decorations with him when they moved in together, so why is he making a stink about it now?", "I'm also not loving the implications of replacing the tree *topper* of all things with a white person...", "Nah she's not an asshole for shutting him down at all. She had a great point. It's sad but he's right that white angels/nutcrackers/villagers are seen as \"regular\". She wanted one place where her kids could feel like they're \"regular\".\n\n\nHis son has the entire world telling him that he's \"regular\".

I think something like that is a compromise", "Are you saying people can't be racist while being married to someone Black?", "It definitely makes me wonder how long they knew each other before the wedding and what kind of discussions they've had about blending the families.

To tell someone that those feelings of discomfort they feel are directly related to their privilege (privilege I don\u2019t ever automatically get as a brown person) and how this is them *not wanting to make space for BIPOC and expand who is privileged* can exhausting.", "And on top of that, he didn't have his own decorations. So, how important is having having Christmas decorations that represent his son, really?", "Yeah the way he went about this is what's so awful.

It was the dad being a racist asshat.", "I saw nothing in the post that indicated the actual child was upset or felt left out.

I'll Google and see if I can find it. I got my dad a few PBS documentaries for Christmas this year and hope to borrow them after he watches them. He was actually really interested in the lectures at Crazy Horse too (it was a full family trip) so I figured this would be a good way to share my interest with him. I'm more of a reader but he doesn't like reading so I figured documentary was the way to go. Didn't even think to check NPR!", "NTA. Just confused about why you remarried this person. Your values seem super incompatible. Coming after you about race regarding *Christmas decorations* seems symptomatic of other BS that would\u2019ve reared its ugly head a long time ago. Good luck with the holidays \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA - I am curious, how many discussions about racial issues did you have before you got married? At a minimum he should be able to.understand that he and his son are what is considered \"normal\" and adding anything that isn't straight up Caucasian to Christmas decorations in public is both rare and considered controversial. It shouldn't be but in 2022 it still is.\n\nYour children shouldn't have to stay in the house to see themselves and feel like they belong.", "NTA \n\nThat edit makes it even worse. Can't imagine marrying someone then finding out they're racist", "I assumed this was just about the topper, and a \"regular\" topping would be a star or something instead of an angel..

This is about creating a welcoming family space, and specifically excluding representative decor items goes against that. And is a 10 y/o going to be able to process mom\u2019s philosophical perspective or just feel excluded in his home? Like, you wouldn\u2019t only get two stockings for her twins and not one for her stepson just because whiteness confers other societal benefits, would you?\n\nEdit: and I just want to be clear, I think OP should keep all of her decorations, but I don\u2019t see any harm in adding some decorations that reflect stepson and dad.", "They never said they wouldn\u2019t allow the ornaments.

I don't like angels, my mom did one and It just not our  thing", "Eh I don't really blame her for her *initial* reaction to just shut the conversation down though, given the way he approached it. It's a sensitive topic and he didn't handle it with much care. In fact from the way she tells it, it sounds more like he approached it with entitlement. I think there's definitely room for her to hear him out and work with him on this when everything simmers down, but he's gotta come back to this with something way better than he started off with. I think the burden of repair is on him.

There are so many micro aggressions in the day for minorities in the US. When the wife complains about these, as one is wont to do, will husband just disregard what she says? Or what will happen if her children face racism? Will he be on their side or that of the \u201cregular\u201d people?  What if they have a child together? How will he view that child, given his keenness to see himself and his son represented but not op and her children?\n\nI am in a mixed marriage (I am Asian American) and there are definitely additional considerations. I am glad that op will be discussing this with her husband and am saddened that he has so little perspective on her need to feel validated in a holiday where so many of the figures are white - in spite of them arising from a religion coming out of the Middle East.", "I also think that if op only had ornaments with white people, he wouldn\u2019t demand representation for op\u2019s children.  Also, that topper is so significant and visible. It\u2019s really offensive that he\u2019s demanding that change.", "Also, given that Christianity is a religion coming out of the Middle East, it would make sense that a large number of the Biblical figures are brown, including angels.", "I think this is a very reasonable solution - ADD to the existing decorations, but not replace.\n\nWe didn't do a tree when I was a kid, and I still don't do a tree as an adult so I don't know about tree toppers. However, in my mind I feel it could be reasonable to have a tree topper that isn't humanoid (like a star or an animal instead of an angel) and it would be nice to have some decorations for the new, blended family.

They picked up Early California olives. There aren't many US olive growers, and only 2 packing houses. One of them, Bell Carter (Lindsay Olives), announced one year recently - AFTER all the small growers spent our money watering, pruning, etc., taking care of the olives - that they would not pick anyone that year or ever again, it was cheaper to import Spanish Olives and pack them. It wasn't \"you have a couple years to switch crops,\" not \"after this year you can't sell your product so don't spend all your farm's money on olives,\" it was \"You've spent all your money, and you aren't going to sell anything. And BTW you can't claim insurance due to weather.\" Half the growers in the US in one fell swoop lost everything they had. MUSCO stepped in (they pack Early California) and said they'd pick 50% of the crop that used to be picked by Bell Carter, even though they HAD NO MORE MARKET than for their half they'd been selling. Didn't know how they would sell it, but by God, they were going to do what they could to keep food on the table while farmers figured out quite WTF we were going to do. They would pick 75% the following year and try to increase their market.\n\nWalmart picked up Early California to help us eat. \n\nThanks Walmart for providing a new market to allow us and our neighbors to eat.

And when you can't sell what you're growing, you have no income in the meantime).", "She probably spent a lot of time and money finding that angel and she and her children love it; why should it have to stay in the box because of her husband\u2019s feelings?
