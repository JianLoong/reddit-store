If you were having a party or being stupidly loud then yes. But you seem like a neighbor 99% of people would want. You are allowed to live in peace, and have the right to do so as long as you aren't messing with others.", "NTA - AND you should have gotten your lawyer to get a restraining order against your neighbor.", "NTA...Your neighbour obviously has issues. It's concerning that your landlord can't see this.  You've done the right thing by arming yourself legally.", "NTA, as others have suggested, your neighbor is unwell.", "NTA obviously.  When you deal with irrational people, it can make you feel like surely there's something wrong with you in the process.  If you were on the outside looking in, you absolutely would not even wonder if you were an asshole.  If you're looking for validation that your neighbor is out of pocket, here you go, internet stranger.  What a nightmare.", "Nta", "NTA. You should also threaten the neighbor directly in conjunction with the landlord. Put a camera, too, if you're allowed.", "NTA\n\nBut you know the answer to your question, right?", "Good for you contacting a lawyer, this neighbor is nothing more than a bully who gets his jollies from harassing you.  Contact your landlord and tell him/her to do something about stopping the harassment or you WILL get your lawyer involved.  NTA.", "NTA.  Definitely pursue harassment action. Including a restraining order. And keep your landlord in the loop. Shoving wet food under the door? That attracts pests of all sorts. Waking you up at 5:30? That's harassment. Filing a false 911 complaint? That's illegal.", "Since you already spent the $ on an attorney, have that attorney send a cease and desist letter to neighbor.  Poor you.  I can't believe the landlord wants to get rid of you!  At the end of the day though this is your home.  Maybe look around when the lease is up.", "NTA.  If you're in the US you may already have enough for a restraining order.  False emergency calls, harassment through your landlord, etc.\n\nBut honestly, if you can move and get away from this neighbor and your (so far) spineless landlord, you should.", "I was going to suggest telling your neighbor to stop their harassment and stalking, to document everything they do, to complain to your landlord (and keep complaining each time something new happens), and then if none of that helps, to see about your legal options. \n\nYou're doing everything you can and you're definitely NTA - but I'm not sure why you think you would be.", "NTA this sounds terrible. You've handled it well and dignified so far.", "NTA for wanting privacy and peace in your own home. Your situation involves several key points:  \nEveryone has a right to privacy in their own home. It's completely reasonable for you to expect not to be disturbed, especially early in the morning, by a neighbor.  \nYou seem to have handled the situation appropriately. You tried to address the issue directly with your neighbor and then involved your landlord when the behavior didn't stop. When that didn't resolve the issue, you appropriately sought legal advice to protect your rights.  \nYour neighbor's behavior, as described, is intrusive and inappropriate. Calling animal control and emergency services based on unfounded claims, as well as listening in on your activities and conversations, is a significant invasion of your privacy.  \nInvolving a lawyer and being prepared to take legal action for harassment is a justified response given the severity and persistence of your neighbor's behavior.  \nAddressing false complaints to your landlord with evidence and legal advice is a responsible way to protect yourself from potential unjust eviction.  \n Wanting to live without harassment and undue disturbance is not only reasonable but also a basic expectation in any living situation."]}
