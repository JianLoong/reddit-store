In my family, even though my parents both worked, my dad generally paid for everything and managed our household funds out of the joint account, to which my mom contributed an amount every month. I found splitting everything and paying each other back constantly sort of annoying, and just didn\u2019t like doing it\u2014it didn\u2019t feel good to me emotionally. We discussed it calmly at a moment when it hadn\u2019t just happened and we decided to cover different categories of expenses rather than splitting things, and we do a monthly check-in to make sure things aren\u2019t too out of whack. So, for example, I now buy all our groceries and he always pays when we go out to eat, and once a month we check in and figure out if there\u2019s a significant difference in those totals. If so, we\u2019ll transfer money right then while we\u2019re sitting there. I\u2019m sure everyone here will flame me for this, but money is emotional, not just functional, and if this is an otherwise good partner for you it\u2019s worth pushing on a real conversation about what she\u2019s been feeling in these moments and what she would prefer to do to make things more fair without splitting every little thing.

Neither my DH or I particularly enjoy grocery shopping, but when we are together doing that chore (which is often), we take the opportunity to talk and engage with each other.

Like I spent 100 dollars on video games last week and she spent a couple hundred on concert tickets a few weeks back.\n\nWe think split transactions on joint bills/expenses or Venmo for utilities and rent is just easier to be mindful of.", "I love this set up! We've been using it for the past 10 years & has worked for us tremendously. If I run low on $$, because of inflation, then he'll give me his CC to pay for a small grocery trip until I get paid again or if he has a special request that he knows is outside of my budget.", "Same here. we've been married 7 years and have separate finances, so we take turns but usually shop together and ask the register to split the bill. I'm surprised at how surprised people are at this lol", "Sounds like they'd be shooting themselves in the foot too. It only takes one to file for divorce", "That's a great point for separate accounts if $ is tight and your parents feared checks bouncing if one person had to write a check and the other party wasn't aware of the balance.  These days it is easier to see your balance through online banking. Ultimately, I think joint accounts require both partners to see eye-to-eye on finances and either be detailed oriented/organized or have a bit of padding in the account.  And even then, there may be practical reasons for having separate accounts. Some people have posted that in their country, joint accounts are not possible.", "We have separate accounts because my mother bankrupted my father and almost bankrupted my step-father. I then was in an abusive relationship. I refuse to allow that to happen to myself or my partner. We split the bills, we share our money, we buy things for each other and take turns buying  nights out, but we will always have separate bank accounts and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "Nta. My husband and I have tried different things in our marriage in the beginning I was in charge of all the money since he wasn\u2019t used to paying bills rent etc.Later we switched to combining paychecks but that didn\u2019t work for us . I\u2019m a saver and he\u2019s a spender. Next thing you know he\u2019s seeing extra funds in the account and buying guns every month. All sorts of electronics etc. while I\u2019m here using coupons buying groceries and not buying shoes clothes etc. I started getting resentful so we switched it up. He pays main bills I pay groceries phone bill vacations. And since I\u2019m a saver. We where able to buy a house and pay off our cars. I say try different ways and see what works", "NTA. And dont spend another dime on her until she pays you back everything she owes.  She knows what she\u2019s doing and taking advantage of you", "NTA. And next time you guys are in line, OP should wander off!", "All of this splitting bills and groceries sounds exhausting to me. My husband of 23 years and I have 2 joint accounts. My money is his money and vice versa. Any big purchases are discussed.", "If she wants to continue to wander off because she's bored waiting for checkout, you can go a few ways:\n\n1. buy a gift card for the store with the amount of money that you two have budgeted for groceries when you first get there (presumably this would be faster than waiting for a lane because you can do this in self-checkout) with cash from each of you or have her buy it and you pay her cash, or\n2. just have her give you cash for her stuff when you get to the line and then she can go play, or\n3. have a joint account that you each put money into for bills, and use that for groceries.\n\nNTA", "For whatever it\u2019s worth, my gf and I use Splitwise to track shared expenses. And we settle up monthly.", "NTA.   You made a point, and she has no ground to stand on if she always does this.  It's very sneaky, deceitful behavior.", "NTA. She\u2019s doing it on purpose. I can\u2019t exactly pin why though either it\u2019s money issues or she just wants you to pay for it but it\u2019s rude as hell though", "She wants you to buy all the food and just \"forget\" to ask for her to give you her half\n\nAnd now she is getting her friends to manipulate you into being ok with it\n\nBubba, time to have a real adult conversation with her about this because otherwise, small things like this become large things that eventually erode the foundation of solid relationships\n\nNTA", "NTA   \nThe way my partner and I split it, is we have a credit card where we charge our split expenses and make equal payments on it.", "NTA sugar daddy you want another baby girl to take care of?", "Random: I have never heard a trolley referred to as a \u201cbuggy\u201d and I love it.", "This reminds me of the sister in law who conveniently forgot her wallet every time they went out to eat. NTA at all, this kind of selfishness drives me insane", "\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "I really don't see the point of a joint account.\n\nMy husband and I have separate accounts and transfer money when needed, or cash out and hand it to the other", "Those aren't mutually exclusive.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Exactly how I do\n\nWe don't have separate grocery lista, except for alcohol, but he usually only buys a can or two every once in a while and I end up giving him a couple bills to pay for that and never wonder if I'll ever get it back", "Same. In our state you're not liable for your spouse's debt if they die and you have separate finances, so we keep our accounts separate in case one of us gets hit by a bus or something, but we use the money interchangeably, and we always end up with each other's ATM cards (which can be annoying when you get to the store & realize you don't have your card).", "In our state you aren't responsible for your spouse's debt if they die, provided you have all separate accounts, so my husband and I keep them separate in case of that. We use the money interchangeably though.", "It definitely works for us. Separate accounts with one shared joint account to pay shared bills. Payment is split according to who makes more money so it's kind of a 70/30 split at the moment since I make more than hubby and the health benefits come out of this paycheck. I also buy majority of the groceries. Whatever money is left over from either of our paychecks is that person's money and can spend it however they like. No fighting because seeing major purchases come out of an account with your name on it doesn't happen unless you're the one making that purchase. Less anxiety.", "THIS ! How you handle your finances is YOUR business alone, and anyone shaming it can go kick a rock. Like, good for you, Stacy and James, for sharing your finances! That doesn't make you entitled to look down on me for wanting to split. \ud83d\ude12", "NTA at all! She knows damn well what she's doing.", "This girl is using you.  She is toxic and manipulative.\n\nReconsider the relationship, because if you marry this lady, guaranteed she does this for every task she doesn't like.", "NTA she knows what she is doing.", "I do all the shopping for my husband and myself, plus our puppy girl.  When I do the  'major'  grocery run the tally is usually between  $350-450 and has occasionally gotten up to >$500.  No, I don't buy really expensive stuff and I check price per unit on just about everything.  He might make a \"wow, that's a lot of money!\"  comment but that's about it since I rarely spend any money on  'me'  stuff.   \n\nNTA and to use separate buggies for  'yours and mine'  sounds like a good idea.", "She sounds manipulative and knows exactly what she\u2019s doing.  NTA.", "I think NTA , but it sounds petty, but not because groceries are expensive. She does pay you back, but it takes too long. \n\n\nIdk we rotate groceries and most times he buys. Depends on your relationship.", "OK, so she does actually pay you back?\n\nTaking \"days\" isn't really that big a deal. If someone owes me money and pays me back in \"days\", i.e. you mean less than a week, that's fine.\n\nI think you actually overreacted here if she is in fact paying you back, but it's irritating that she just walks off and lets you deal with it, it's kind of dismissive, like she's leaving the staff to handle it for her. Even without the money, that's annoying.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.   She's deliberately trapping you into paying for her part of the groceries.   Moving in with her may have been a mistake.", "NTA, she is 100% doing this on purpose to get you to pay.  It's not hard to just hand your card to someone  and have them pay with your money.", "I agree with you, what it comes down to is OP shouldn\u2019t have to take those steps just to stop being taken advantage of by their gf. Their gf should respect them enough to not be doing that in the first place.", "I order my groceries from walmart for pickup so I don't have to wander the store and so I don't pick up dumb shit along the way and so I can keep a good eye on the total. I budget myself $45-50 a week. Grocery shopping with my bf on the other hand is meandering around the store, getting separated, and spending $150 on dumb shit. He cooks more than I do so we'll have a good meal or two but we pick up so much stuff we wouldn't buy, and don't need to buy, than we would if we just ordered our stuff from Walmart for pickup"]}
