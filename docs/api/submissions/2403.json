In my family, even though my parents both worked, my dad generally paid for everything and managed our household funds out of the joint account, to which my mom contributed an amount every month. I found splitting everything and paying each other back constantly sort of annoying, and just didn\u2019t like doing it\u2014it didn\u2019t feel good to me emotionally. We discussed it calmly at a moment when it hadn\u2019t just happened and we decided to cover different categories of expenses rather than splitting things, and we do a monthly check-in to make sure things aren\u2019t too out of whack. So, for example, I now buy all our groceries and he always pays when we go out to eat, and once a month we check in and figure out if there\u2019s a significant difference in those totals. If so, we\u2019ll transfer money right then while we\u2019re sitting there. I\u2019m sure everyone here will flame me for this, but money is emotional, not just functional, and if this is an otherwise good partner for you it\u2019s worth pushing on a real conversation about what she\u2019s been feeling in these moments and what she would prefer to do to make things more fair without splitting every little thing.

I love feeling like a team.", "Right! It depends on how you spend money, and everyone is going to be different on that front.\n\nRight now it works out with BF and I because we don't live together full time. I buy nice groceries and make meals a few days a week, he pays for meals out that equal out to the same (one lunch and one dinner out equal out to 3 dinners and 2 lunches at/from home, and I think we all know this). But if/when we end up living together full time, things might need to be split up more...or maybe not. I buy some expensive foods, he buys some expensive foods...maybe it will even out.\n\nBut it sounds like OP is a struggling young person, and needs to split the grocery bill. If GF is loading up the cart with fancy stuff and leaving him to pay for it, then he is NTA and needs to ask her to shop for her stuff on her own or stay in line to split the bill! I wouldn't toss $6 gelato pints into a cart I knew someone else was paying for!", "My husband and I have been married for 31 years and we get along very well. \n\nWe are solidly middle class, not \u201cextremely well off\u201d.\n\nWe have different views on spending. I believe that people should live within their means, he believes that people shouldn\u2019t deny themselves what they want due to lack of funds. Not combining our finances has probably saved us from divorce not headed us toward divorce.", "That\u2019s how my fianc\u00e9 and I have decided to do our finances once we get married. But 4 accounts. A joint checking for household bills and stuff, joint savings that we both put \u201cx amount\u201d in, and then mine/his spending account. That way we know the bills are getting paid and money is getting saved. All while not complaining about how much a miscellaneous item that we wanted (not needed) cost.", "Spouses generally share meals though. Do you and your family member make a meal together that you both eat, she just adds meat? If so, that\u2019s an arrangement I\u2019ve never heard of before, but I\u2019d agree you shouldn\u2019t \u201csubsidize\u201d the meat since she is basically a roommate. Spouses aren\u2019t roommates though. I used to live with roommates, we all bought and cooked our own food. If someone wanted to share their food with someone, it was treated like a gift. With my spouse, we make meals we both want to eat. There are some foods I like to eat that he doesn\u2019t, and some things he likes that I don\u2019t. Depending on the thing the other just sucks it up for that meal once in a while, or picks out an offending ingredient. We treat groceries as a shared expense, and it\u2019s one I cover as part of my fair share of our expenses (we do the method where one person covers certain bills and the other covers others). I don\u2019t eat cereal, but I buy cereal every week because he eats it. I simply cannot imagine feeling like I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for his cereal. He\u2019s my partner lol.", "Aww! My husband does the same. He's been telling me not to look at our credit card since he's been planning a surprise for my birthday and the transaction would give it away.", "Is there a reason why we should? We were in our late 30s when we married, we both have separate finances and banks we're happy with. Neither wanted to create a 3rd account or to change banks. We're adults who manage our finances just fine.  We can be responsible and collaborative about our financial responsibilities without making life harder by trying to overturn decades of independent banking amd financial records.", "What will you do when you're both retired and he's broke?", "It\u2019s kind of sad because I think what starts out as equal contribution is bastardized into something like that when one person decides they want to be selfish and the other is left picking up the slack. That\u2019s when the transaction stuff happens because that\u2019s the only way to keep it fair when one party sucks like that. It\u2019s the beginning of the end at that point, I think.", "For sure lol. I think most couples over time develop dependences on each other. I would have a hard time if something happens to him too - he does all the cooking and chores around the house.", "Wow, that's interesting. You can't even designate a primary account holder and a secondary account holder who has the ability to withdraw funds?", "No, we can\u2019t."]}
