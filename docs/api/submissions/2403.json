In my family, even though my parents both worked, my dad generally paid for everything and managed our household funds out of the joint account, to which my mom contributed an amount every month. I found splitting everything and paying each other back constantly sort of annoying, and just didn\u2019t like doing it\u2014it didn\u2019t feel good to me emotionally. We discussed it calmly at a moment when it hadn\u2019t just happened and we decided to cover different categories of expenses rather than splitting things, and we do a monthly check-in to make sure things aren\u2019t too out of whack. So, for example, I now buy all our groceries and he always pays when we go out to eat, and once a month we check in and figure out if there\u2019s a significant difference in those totals. If so, we\u2019ll transfer money right then while we\u2019re sitting there. I\u2019m sure everyone here will flame me for this, but money is emotional, not just functional, and if this is an otherwise good partner for you it\u2019s worth pushing on a real conversation about what she\u2019s been feeling in these moments and what she would prefer to do to make things more fair without splitting every little thing.

Start a joint acct for bills, groceries, utilities.", "You caught on, she realized it so she threw the blame back at you in an effort to detract from her scammy ways. She\u2019s been playing you, OP. NTA.", "NTA entirely. \n\nHonestly, I really don't think the reason she is wandering off is because she is bored. I honestly think she's trying to get out of paying. You having to hound her for her portion for weeks might be her way of either hoping you'll forget or that you will get so sick of hounding her that you give up. Clearly you do sometimes seeing as you said you can't afford to keep buying the groceries by yourself.", "NTA. Groceries are so expensive right now. You agreed to split the grocery bills right?", "NTA. Embarrassing behavior on her part tbh.", "Absolutely. YATA for not communicating, for footing the bill, for not figuring it out before you go to the store, and for expecting a different outcome when nothing has changed.", "ESH You both sound petty as fuck. Match made in heaven.", "Just get her card to pay before she leaves the line", "If she\u2019s really bored she needs to leave her card with you. That\u2019s what I do if I have to pee too bad to wait.", "NTA. But is it at all possible she struggles with anxiety about communicating about money? \n\nFrom personal experience: when I got married we combined finances and grocery shopped together for the first time - I was very money conscious and appalled at how much my (reasonably larger) husband added to the grocery bill. I just had a \u201csafe\u201d number in my head. \n\nOften while we shopped together I\u2019d find myself upset at the checkout. We shared finances so there was no chance for me to \u201cwalk out on the bill\u201d - but I can see how my anxiety in those early days influenced me. \n\nJust a thought. She absolutely should recognize this is a problem, but a lot of people get really wound up about money for personal reasons. If y\u2019all stay together it can be a point of growth to address, but right now it\u2019s a point of contention. Gently addressing it would be helpful if you want to keep the girl around.", ">If she is \"bored\" in the store then this should solve the problem.\n\nthis is the line that i actually, probably unreasonably and irrationally, hated. so. much. she gets \"*bored*\" in the store, so she wanders off?? is she a fucking child??? how has she survived adulthood if she just wanders off like a goddamn toddler. omg. at best it's the weirdest, worst defense she could take and a shit liar, at worst... she's an incredible moron.", "NTA. So she left the store completely?? Knowing she had to pay for her stuff.", "Yeah, once you have to do something like this to enforce a super fair, fully-expressed boundary, it\u2019s kind of a sign that your partner isn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship, especially if she shames your for it in front of other people later.", "THIS! Hit the nail right on the fucking head !!", "this would normally make sense, but if my partner is so crappy they're trying to not pay me for stuff, the last thing I want to do is give them direct access to my credit and $$.", "Or just go to the grocery store by yourself and get what you want.  NTA OP.", "Or you can switch weeks paying and then one person gets the opportunity to not stand in line. It's definitely boring and you often get that customer who argues the price of everything and takes up all the cashier's time. But it shouldn't always be one person standing in line and the other always getting to wander off. If you paid one week she pays the full bill next week and that means it's her turn to stand in line. Getting seperate groceries is a bit messy I find, I've done that and it's disaster.", "This is a very silly idea!! That\u2019s how do you deal with a poorly intentioned person you are stuck with\u2026if that\u2019s how you have to treat your partner\u2026do you even want that to be your partner?", "The best solution is to break up because nobody's got time to play stupid games", "I'd just walk away before she does.", ">Another main character who has generously given us all cameos in their own personal movie\n\nLove that!", "I'm surprised by the number of married folks splitting the grocery bill... Do you not just pay out of a joint account? Seems to me like food should be a joint expense?", "Ahh, the mating call of the perpetually single asshole. I feel bad for anyone you're in a relationship with, having to walk on eggshells around your quitter ass, least you chuck them to the side like a used tampon.", "What I don\u2019t get is the splitting the actual items up. My partner and I don\u2019t have a joint account but we take turns buying things like groceries", "I'm surprised by this as well. My husband and I don't have a joint account, but we very much share finances and always have since living together even before we were married. He pays the mortgage and certain bills and I pay groceries, bills, and other household expenses. He will occasionally pay for groceries as well depending. Neither of us expect to be paid back for anything. I love spending money 9n him and he loves spending money on me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "We don't do joint accounts. We both have jobs and make a similar amount of money. So we just split expenses and don't have to worry about what the other person is spending on and accidentally overdrawing the account. Though we just ask the cashier to split the bill at the grocery store. Don't want to mess up the BOGOs or miss out on spend X get Y discounts.", "My husband and I don't have a joint account. This is mostly just left over from when we started dating and had been living with roommates. We all would split bills and everyone would pay me since the bills were in my name. Once our roommates moved out and it was just us, we found it was a lot easier this way rather than setting up a new joint account and changing all our deposits over to it. We also both had debts that we didn't want to burden the other with so keeping it separate is just easier for us", "What the fuck are you talking about? OPs the one getting used here. His gf is using him for free groceries and she knows it. He's confronted her before and she didn't care. Why bother playing stupid games like \"I'll leave too and now nobody gets groceries\" instead of leaving, finding someone who doesn't use you for food and letting her buy her shit like a big girl?", "Yep, that's how we've always done it. Like you, I'm surprised at all the apparent nickel-and-diming that goes on in marriages.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, and for us, I was in grad school for like 5 years while he had a well paying job. Then I eventually got better paying job than him. The income disparity would be really troublesome if we didn't just combine everything.", "Interesting. I guess I'm like the financial manager of our household and it's best that way since my husband is terrible at keeping track of things. He forgets to pay his bills or cancel subscriptions constantly. So having a joint account works for us.\n\nAlso, our incomes have at times been wildly different, so having all the money in one place helps us feel like a team.", "Do I need to quote the same sentences again? Or are you going to fail to see them for a second time? \n\nHe wants to fix it. She's actively ignoring him. You're expecting him to pay again and keep falling into the same pattern aka keep enabling her?", "I'm a sex worker and some of these reddit marriages are more transactional than 'arrangements' I've had.", "My SO and I have always had a joint account.", "My husband and I have separate finances and we have certain bills that we're each responsible for. I usually buy the groceries simply because he's rarely home (works on the road) so that's not a big deal.  For anything else like dinner out, entertainment, etc., we pretty much just take turns but are not strict about it. Usually, if he's home and I pick up dinner and a movie or something, then he'll grab the groceries next time. If we're fighting over who is going to pay, it's usually because we both want to be the one to pay and argue over who's going to \"get to\" pay.  \n\nI can't imagine nickel and diming him, but OP's girlfriend is definitely being a mooch.", "Hah! Exactly.", "Us too. It was like putting two nickles together to survive. I don't understand all the post about separate accounts. Seems selfish but if you're not on the same page about everything it won't work."]}
