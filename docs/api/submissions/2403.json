Id also suggest that when you go grocery shopping you make a list beforehand of your needed items, split the list and when arriving at the store she gets a buggy..you get a buggy and each get the items on your perspective lists and add in any items to your personal buggy that you may just want...then check out in separate lines.

Don\u2019t fall for it.", "NTA\n\nShe knows exactly what she's doing.", "NTA and from now on.. shop separately. Buy your stuff and she can buy her own stuff. I noticed you said you bought the things \u201cyou both needed and wanted \u201c. I guess the best way to handle all this is separate carts.. if you go together\u2026the the stuff you need together can go in a separate shopping basket in your cart.  Also go first in line so she can\u2019t stiff you at the register.", "NTA\n\n\"It takes days or weeks for her to repay me or send me her portion\"\n\nShe knows what she's doing, and she's taking you for a ride.", "NTA and you played this brilliantly.", "NTA. Your girlfriend 1000% knows what she\u2019s doing. If it takes her a while to pay you back, she\u2019s hoping eventually you\u2019ll forget or stop asking for the funds. She\u2019s taking advantage of you. You should consider doing separate grocery runs or reconsider the living together.", "NTA, but you guys have a serious communication issue. She obviously doesn't feel comfortable about finances. You need to have a conversation with her on helping her that way you guys can be financially sound if you're going to make a relationship last. One of the things I learned early on money is one of the top reasons for breakups and divorce. You guys need to be on the same page, if you aren't you'll never work out.", "NTA. I really just can\u2019t imagine her not knowing what she\u2019s doing? Getting distracted while waiting in line is one thing. Leaving the store altogether and not answering the phone is another altogether, especially when she\u2019s right there when you\u2019re done.", "Yeah NTA.

I think you actually played this really well and did the right thing.", "NTA\n You played this brilliantly. \nYou did all the right things first...You tried to talk to her and find out if there was a problem, it didn't work...  \nShe knows what she is doing, there's not doubt about it. Now she knows she can't play dumb forever.", "NTA - something I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet is that it is also incredibly unfair to make you always be the person who has to wait through and deal with checkout. Its boring for everyone. No one likes waiting in line to pay for something. Why does she feel entitled to not having to deal with it?\n\nRegardless of that point, she also could contribute by giving you her card before she walks away or giving you cash before you go to the store. Its easy to split a check.", "NTA - And consider having her give you at least partial payment before shopping if she refuses to shop like an adult instead of wandering off like a bored child.", "NTA - You both agreed to split finances a certain way. You should not have to beg, or even remind, her to pay her share.", "NTA. She is 100% wandering off at check-out time on purpose.", "NTA- and I would laugh and say- walking off when it's time to pay the bill every single time is telling behavior. do it again, and I will do the same as this time. Paying me back weeks and weeks later and forcing us both to keep up with it is nonsense if you are ready and willing to pay at the time of shopping. If you aren't, then it's dishonest to pretend otherwise and simply run away when time to check out.", "NTA\n\nYou both communicated your boundaries and agreements, and you\u2019ve brought up your feelings on the matter to her. She however is ignoring all of this an has not even attempted to change or compromise", "This is about control and respect. She's willing to manipulate you into supporting her. I suspect she's hoping you'll get tired of hounding her for money and just start paying for her. Trying to guilt you in front of her friend is manipulative and shows how little she respects you. I'd demand couple's counseling so you can discuss this in front of an impartial party. If she refuses, I'd end the relationship.", "NTA since it's an ongoing issue you've tried to address. She's a grown up. She can stay in line with you and not wander off. Good ness. Maybe she needs to pre-pay.", "NTA\n\nYou've talked about finances.   You attempted to contact her before your abandoned her groceries.   She apparently didn't respond to either.", "NTA and like someone else already said she knows what she's doing. And if she thinks it's not a big deal then she should have no problem paying for them!!", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to guilt you for catching her scheming. She knows she\u2019s in the wrong. Do it to her the next time y\u2019all go shopping", "Ignoring your call tells you this is intentional. Good for you standing your ground financially", "NTA. She obviously does this so she doesn\u2019t have to pay. From now on don\u2019t go shopping with her and just get what you need. If she does come with you then get two carts.", "NTA. This is the equivalent of the friend who always forgets their card when you go out to eat.  They always say they will pay you back but deep down they are hoping you forget about it.", "NTA. Your girlfriend on the other hand\u2026", "NTA.", "You are absolutely NOT the ahole. She is using you and hoping you won\u2019t ask\nFor the money", "nta, \n\nbut why not just get a joint account/cash pot for grocereries. always having to go with 2 is both a hassle and a time waster.\n\nbudget is x, both put x in, and now only 1 person can do it, without having to split the bill at the registry, what sounds super unpractical. you sound like those bired our of their mind couples where one needs to go for clothes, and the other just sits there.", "NTA. So she left the store completely?? Knowing she had to pay for her stuff. Then just sits on a bench and questions you when you have less items.. Dude, she sounds very inconsiderate. You 2 need separate carts or baskets. Or just go alone. Stop on your way home from work and pick up what you want or need. Don't let her take advantage of you.", "I'm going with a bit of ESH.

It also takes away the \"work\" of having to do single bank transfer for everything you guys buy together.", "NTA.\n\nIs your gf 5 years old? Because what adult goes wandering in a grocery store when it is time to pay because they are bored? That\u2019s something that children do, not adults that have obligations to feed themselves and should recognize that not everything in life is going to be fun and amusing. Not gonna lie, if my significant other did this, I would let it go the first time. But the second time? I do the shopping by myself and they can order Instacart.", "NTA. If it is a habit it is probably not an accident. If you have Venmo you could try using split wise or something like it. You can put in bills and expenses and it will automatically split them up and you can then Request them.", "Have you guys ever talked about having a joint account?

Good for you for not playing that game. She was trying to get you foot the bill and she knows it. I used to go to the bathroom right before the check came on dates. Lol. We all know this game. Good on you for not playing. Tell her you're not dumb, and laugh it off. Well played.", "NTA- you brought up the subject of her leaving you to pay for all the groceries and not paying you back, \"as she always does.\" That one time should have been enough. I hope she took the lesson to heart. If not, well, that's another discussion.", "Freeloaders always have excuses,she is no exception.", "NTA You are being played.", "NTA, but if you want a slightly more positive interpretation, my husband and I had a similar fight when we first started living together. In my family, even though my parents both worked, my dad generally paid for everything and managed our household funds out of the joint account, to which my mom contributed an amount every month. I found splitting everything and paying each other back constantly sort of annoying, and just didn\u2019t like doing it\u2014it didn\u2019t feel good to me emotionally. We discussed it calmly at a moment when it hadn\u2019t just happened and we decided to cover different categories of expenses rather than splitting things, and we do a monthly check-in to make sure things aren\u2019t too out of whack. So, for example, I now buy all our groceries and he always pays when we go out to eat, and once a month we check in and figure out if there\u2019s a significant difference in those totals. If so, we\u2019ll transfer money right then while we\u2019re sitting there. I\u2019m sure everyone here will flame me for this, but money is emotional, not just functional, and if this is an otherwise good partner for you it\u2019s worth pushing on a real conversation about what she\u2019s been feeling in these moments and what she would prefer to do to make things more fair without splitting every little thing. Just because you agreed on it in theory doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work in practice.", "NTA. She is gaslighting you. I don\u2019t know anyone who goes shopping with someone just disappear right before check out and return right after you check out everything. If that happens on a regular basis then that\u2019s some manipulation right there kinda reminds me of the lady who always \u201cforgot her wallet\u201d when going out to dinner so the person grabbed her wallet that they saw she left and when that person use the excuse I forgot my wallet and they pulled it out that person got mad.", "NTA. If she's bored she can bring a fucking book, not go on an adventure. I can only imagine how she is at other perfectly normal adult tasks.", "She\u2019s playing you", "NTA. But she\u2019s definitely doing it on purpose. She needs to cut it out or move", "NTA girlfriend is freeloading", "That's a really good idea, thank you", "This is silly. A better solution is to play dumb and just follow her when she walks away. \n\nHe can smile sweetly and say he was \u201cbored\u201d too.", "Definitely entitled, she gets to wonder around while BF has to endure the \"boring\" checkout line. Honestly, I can't stand people like that, you have to be entertained literally every single second of the day? Everyone also has phones now so there isn't even an excuse for leaving, just look at your phone for 3 and a half minutes until your turn, or heaven forbid, talk to your partner for a few moments... Another main character who has generously given us all cameos in their own personal movie lol NTA", "Conveniently did t answer her phone. She\u2019s probably habit back watching op and waiting for him to pay and then re-surface. \n\nImagine walking around/hiding in the store because you want to force your BF to pay for the groceries. How does she justify that to herself? I\u2019m not sure I could be with someone like that. NTA op.", "Yes. Separate carts or you shop completely separate as in different times of day. And when she gives you grief about it again I would mention that she doesn\u2019t pay you back timely but also won\u2019t cop to a financial issue so the only other thing to be considered is that she is using you. Make it clear why it isn\u2019t acceptable behavior. She gets bored? But she expects you to stand there regardless. She isn\u2019t considering you at all", "NTA, she knows but just doesn't care enough. At least now she knows your seriousness about keeping costs split among you two now. If she still doesn't, keep following the same process when she disappears until she does.", "We go with both because we go on a day we both have off from work, we do other things before the grocery shopping. We have tried to both put x amount towards it on our reloadable card for living expenses but with how frequently prices are changing at our stores, we've come up a good amount short before. Othertimes we cut back and have some left, which she takes the card and spends it instead of letting it grow.", "*His* actions are passive aggressive?", "Wrong. His response had been to talk with her. That didn't work, so he simply refused to fall for her antics again. Nothing passive or aggressive about that. NTA", "When my husband and I go grocery shopping for our big shops, we will use one cart to get everything but then we go to self check-out and get two registers right next to each other and put the cart between us. That way we can just grab what we already agreed to getting and split it that way. And we almost always come out to similar costs as well. It definitely helps us and then neither of us need to hassle the other to pay them back. But we also don't have that issue either anyways.", "You're very welcome. I hope it helps!", "This is what my hubby and I do. We get a cart and each gets a little basket. personal indulgences are paid for by the person using their own fun money for food. Everything else that\u2019s communal winds up in the cart. Been doing this for 23 years.", "You could also just get her to give you her credit card to pay for it while she wanders, although that doesn't solve the extra labour you're putting in doing the checking out.", "Whatever works for you \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Though that also seems \"silly\" because then how would they get their grocery items if they both just walked out. But if that works for you, then thats cool, im glad you found a solution in case that happens to you and your partner.", "Thank you for saying that! I really wasn\u2019t sure how the suggestion would be received.. I appreciate it !", "Both of their actions are. Like I said, she's more of an AH and also passive aggressive, but his response is also.", "Lol don't bother arguing. You can give your judgement, I'll give mine.", "My SO and I kinda do this. One cart, but we always go to self check out. So the front half of the cart is \"his\" and back half is mine. He rings up and pays for his. Then I ring up and pay for mine.

I tried again when the cashier started ringing up the items and she still didn't answer\n\nHe tried to communicate. She deliberately ignored him. F\u00d7cking around and finding out is not \"passive aggressive\".", "Same here, whim trips on the way home after work, we typically don't ask to get paid back unless it's a bigger trip that we've communicated ahead of time. Though if the store is really busy, we will do one check-out to save time and then whomever paid, the other pays them back once we get to the car or get home.", "Then fix it before going to the store - decide on a budget before you leave home, get gf to Venmo before leaving. If it doesn't happen then no go."]}
