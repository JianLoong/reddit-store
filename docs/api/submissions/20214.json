My room was on the first floor, their guest room was on the second floor.

I have no problem with that, but sometimes it's annoying cause he just comes in without knocking and makes himself at home in my room. I'm a very tidy and clean person, so it kinda irritated me that he just touches everything and goes on my bed with his dirty feet. My bedroom has a bathroom in it where I bathe and etc. After I bathe, I put on my clothes in my room/outside of the bathroom because my wardrobe is in my room. And with my cousin always coming in without knocking, I lock my door everytime I'm about to bathe, I sometimes forget to unlock it though, so sometimes when he's about to barge in, the door is locked. Now, because of me locking the doors, I've already avoided MANY times where he could've barged in while I'm naked. \n\nSo, when I was in the middle of putting on clothes, my mother was greeted with the locked doors. After putting on my clothes I opened it for her. She then walked in and continued to ask if I locked the doors so my cousin can't hang out with me. I said no, and said that it was cause I was putting on clothes. Then she went on about how it's rude to lock doors when we have guests, and said that I'm just making up excuses not to hang out with my cousin.\n\nNow being the person Iam, I hate being falsely accused. So I just went off on my mom saying how is it rude if I'm changing my clothes, I need the privacy, and to also avoid my cousin seing my naked on accident, etc. My mom snapped back at me basically telling the story how he has no siblings, no one to talk with, how he's so pitiful, how he's only gonna be staying for a few weeks, and still insisted that locking the doors was rude. Then we had this argument back and forth. I didn't back off, so in the end my mom did.

If I were you, I would invite everyone to have a talk. Your mum, aunt, cousin and probably sister (she needs a good example to follow if she is younger). And just openly talk about the door thing. Address the problem to your aunt though. The key is to talk and not let anyone (your mum) stop you until you finish.\nIf they are adequate (especially aunt) they will understand. The aunt maybe not aware of the situation and she is the one responsible for your cousin. Your mum should be there 100% as well so she hears what you say. \nIf it doesn't work and they continue with the rude stuff - just screw it and continue to lock the door. Your privacy and comfort are more important.\nI have a grandma with the similar behavior (everything for the guest's comfort, while family doesn't matter), she could be stopped only if you talk to the guest about the problem in front of her and the guest agrees with the unconvinience and possible solution.
