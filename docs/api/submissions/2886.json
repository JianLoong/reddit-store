Our mother (42f) has remarried and is now legally blind. before her health began to decline in 2018, she took us both to live with her and her new family.\n\nI didn't like our stepdad. In 2020, he took advantage of my mom's health decline to funnel mine and my sister's allowances from our aunt, who started providing money to us bc of our situation (deceased dad and disabled mom left us with basically no money), straight to his own bank account. At some point I decided that I've had enough and that the best course of action was to leave his home and get myself a job since I recently turned 18.\n\nSo within one month, I was living in my own apartment. My sister stayed with our mom.\n\nFlash forward to earlier this year, I got a surprise call from my sister telling me to pick her up from their home bc she got kicked out by our stepdad. When I went and picked her up and her stuff, I asked my sister what happened, she went on about how she was always being blamed for things that she claimed she had nothing to do with, like swiping cash from my stepfamily, and other minor hygiene related issues like leaving dishes with food. She wasn't like this before so I thought they lied to me about her behavior.\n\nWeeks pass and I started noticing that I somehow seemed to always have less cash in my wallet than expected. I also started noticing a stench from my sister's room. At this point I knew everything they said about my sister was true. She took money from me, lied to me about going to school, and somehow got me a warning from my landlord about the stench and \"landfill\" appearance of my once clean aprtmnt. I pushed all my frustrations deep inside me bc I knew that she didn't want to go back to our stepdad's house when I had a talk with her.\n\nThen yesterday, I found out that she stole money from me again. But it wasn't a little bit of money, she took the cash that was supposed to be for bills and spent it all on her every day visit to various fast food stops. Naturally, I got angry and demanded she return what was left of the money only to be told that there was absolutely 0 left. Eventually, I forgave her after scrounging up enough to pay for our due bills but if it happened again, she was out.\n\nToday, I found out she broke my laptop and hid it from me. This absolutely broke me. I worked for my laptop so that I could play my video games and treat myself to a small reprieve every time I get stressed at work. I was so devastated that I packed her bags and brought her back to our mom and stepdad's.\n\nShe's 12. A literal child. And I feel so shitty about leaving her back at our mother's house but at this point idk what to do. Genuinely wondering if what I did was right or if I was being an asshole for kicking out a child.

You are not that child\u2019s parent or legal guardian.", "NTA.  You are not ready to be responsible for a child but you have it a try when you saw your sister needed help.  She on the other hand needs more support than you can provide.  Given the situation at home, she probably needs some counseling and proper parenting.  Good luck.", "NTA. There may be deep psychological reasons she's doing this but your mom needs to step in as the parent, get her to a counselor and...PARENT. You tried, and honestly this isn't on you.", "NTA. However, there might be deeper issues causing your sister to act this way. I think she needs to speak with a counselor or someone she can open up to. Sometimes these behaviours are a cry for help. It's quite unfortunate that she did all those things while staying with you. You said she was never the type to do that. Let's hope it's just from peer pressure and not something in her home that's causing her to act out.", "Look, she\u2019s a 12 year old girl in an unhealthy situation. This is a cry for help. She needs therapy, a stable and safe home structure, and a responsible adult to put in time, money, and effort into teaching her healthy tools and habits while showing her love.\n\nYou are 20 years old. You are still growing and learning yourself. You are also dealing with your own trauma from your upbringing.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if giving your sister what she needs is beyond your capabilities. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to know what to do or even to have the resources to do it.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t step up she\u2019s going back to a home where things are only going to get worse. There is likely no happy ending for your sister.\n\nAnd while that\u2019s not your fault, and you genuinely and truly shouldn\u2019t blame yourself, it is very sad.\n\nI\u2019m not giving a judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

THEN GET YOUR SISTER IN THERAPY!!", "NTA you deserve nice things! Do you think your aunt could get your sister into therapy? Your stepdad is a financial abuser and your sister needs therapy, do you think your aunt might be able to help?", "Can you contact the aunt who was sending you money and see if she can help? Can you call CPS with any evidence that they threw out a minor child and see what kind of help they can provide? If they\u2019ve already thrown her out there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll taker her back, she could wind up on the street without somebody helping", "This. Sister sounds troubled, has learnt some bad coping strategies, and needs way more help than OP can provide. \nOP isn\u2019t the AH for not being able to cope, but 12yo who has been dumped in an abusive household isn\u2019t, either.", "Why would you need to guilt trip OP into helping? It is not OP responsibility and she should, by not means, feel responsible, more so, when OP is barely an adult.  She gave the sister a lot it opportunities which she all dismissed, this is not a six year old, at 12 you know exactly what you are doing.\n\nOP, please don\u2019t listen to this person, do the best you can for yourself, don\u2019t look back. Best of luck.", "You think? She\u2019s 12, her older brother left and she\u2019s stuck with a mother that is unable to care for her 100% while living with an abusive stepdad. Hmm I wonder where things went wrong.", "I agree the OP isn\u2019t responsible. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that their sister needs help. There\u2019s a ton of trauma in this family. A twelve year old suffering trauma is often going to do so in unhealthy ways, especially if not given the tools/knowledge to do otherwise.\n\nI didn\u2019t give a judgement because this is beyond Reddit and there are no good answers.", "NTA call the cops and tell them your mother and stepfather abandoned their 12 year old child, they\u2019ll handle it from there.", "NTA and Do Not Feel shitty. At 12, she is perfectly capable of not stealing and cleaning up after herself. Also, she is a liar, which she also knows is wrong. She has made her crappy little bed and now must lay in it.\n\nShe destroyed your property, stole loads of money from you, got you in the shit with you landlord, and then showed no remorse. She needs help, but you are not in the position to offer it at this time. You are better off letting her parental figures address this.", "NTA but I feel like you should talk to CPS/social services\n\nStepdad kicked out a 12 year old??\n\nHe financially exploited you both for years\n\nSomething is going on here for your sister to be acting out like this. My only worry if that people sometimes use extremely poor hygiene to repel abusers. They then keep this behaviour up because they still feel frightened", "NAH.  I can't call a child in that situation an asshole but it's not your job to care for your sister and I understand if you feel you can't.  It's an incredibly shitty situation.  You mentioned an aunt who seemed involved - would she be able to help?", "NTA. Your sister needs help but you aren\u2019t in a position to provide it.  Can you call CPS and see if you can get her free therapy services?", "NTA but neither is your sister. She's having typical trauma responses. Where is your aunt? Could she possibly step in and raise your sister? I'm not a fan of CPS, but if you can't take her on ( which I'm not suggesting that you should since you're young and obviously have your own trauma to work through), maybe they should be called. Your sister clearly needs help and from the sounds of it could end up one of those homeless teens who end up missing, especially since stepdad kicked her out once while being so young. The real A H is your mom. Being blind is no excuse for having your children grow up in an abusive home. She chose an easier life for herself over her responsibility to her kids. There are plenty of assistance programs that could help, but she's okay with allowing her A H husband to be abusive to her kids and then kick out her minor child. That poor kid.", "NTA\n\nI really kept questioning if she was 12 because she has so much freedom (idk if this is the right word). I am concerned for her because obviously she gained these habits through her mistreatment by step-dad. Sorry you gotta deal with all this.", "NTA, I would have called the police after the second time and kicked her out", "You are not her parent though and her needs have to be addressed by caring professionals as well as caring family. She needs a guardian, but not someone who is just getting on their feet to help themselves. You'll both soon fall apart this way.\n\nSo, I'd seek some guidance from the aunt who has been so helpful in the past. Is there a way to get your sister the professional supports she needs without you being her only care provider? Does she qualify for SSI because neither parent is available to financially support her? So many questions about how to get her some more help.\n\nNTA.", "I agree totally.  Call cos before she steals from the wrong person and ends up in juice.", "I think OP needs to see if there\u2019s any help and support sister can access from afar. Are CPS/school/welfare services aware of her etc.", "Also, want to know how long sis was with OP. Mom probably gets disability for the 12 yo plus survivor benefits. If mom wasn't paying that to OP for caring for the sis during her stay, there could be legal repercussions for that. \n\nIf OP can get proof that the stepdad didn't spend the SSI funds properly, he can get his step dad in trouble for that. SSI survivor benefits are %100 to be spent on the child. A portion of housing, utilities, etc can be counted. Anything put in savings has to be put into an account with the child's name on it and statements for that account have to be turned in with payee statements every year. My daughter's father was deceased.", "You're giving a guilt trip", "OP won\u2019t have a home at all of the sister keeps stealing the rent to buy fast food.", "Julie not juice. I don\u2019t know how to edit.", "Were you going for Julie or Juvie?", "NTA but please call CPS on them. They cannot kick out a 12 year old. It\u2019s sick.", "Nah. Call cps. To me something Is hidding", "NTA a) you are not her parent and \nb) you are teaching her valuable life lessons. If you enabled her that would not do her good in the long run. She needs to learn not to steal etc. Your opti9ns are very limited\n\nBut I do think she needs help. I agree with contacting your aunt and maybe her school?", "NTA\n\nNormally I'd advocate for a person taking care of their sibling(s) but you've done literally _everything you can_. You're a young adult, you need to heal from the trauma that __you've__ experienced in __your__ life and not be responsible for your sister, who's being disrespectful and is behaving in a narcissistic manner.\n\nYour sister needs to be in therapy and this is __WAY__ above your pay grade. \n\nIf she's not mentally, emotionally and/or physically safe at your mom and step-dad's, then involve cps, who will find an appropriate home for her. Otherwise, she needs to go back home with your mother and step-father. Just because your mom's visually impaired, it in no way means that she's an unfit mother. If she is (as deemed by cps), that's a completely different issue, seperate from any visual impairment. \n\nHonestly, this is not a healthy relationship that you have with your sister and you can't let her behaviour threaten or risk the safety and/or security of your home, job and/or life.\n\nAll the best to you!", "NTA", "NTA\nYou aren't prepared to parent a child. You are just starting to recover from the neglect and emotional toxicity of your own childhood. Learning how and when to establish healthy boundaries in your relationships, and developing an adult life that provides the support and resources you need to feel healthy, safe and secure are appropriate goals for this stage of your life. I hope you will find therapeutic support to help you unravel the twisted upbringing you've had and develop a \"normal meter\" for evaluating what's healthy, what's acceptable and what absolutely isn't in relationships.\n\nThere should be a social security survivors benefit for minors after the death of a parent. If your mom followed up on that, that money has probably been diverted to stepdad's \"all the money\" acct. While you are probably too old now, that could be a source of financial support for your sister. CPS could help your sister get the support she needs to help her. Her behavior isn't very unusual in neglected kids, who live in a constant state of insecurity and often grasp at resources as if scarcity is always a threat and there's no reliable base or available resources they \"can rely on.\"\n\nYou both need all the help you can get to break free of the insecurity and devaluing of your childhood environment. Much as you care for your sister, you do not have the tools to be the stable, secure, healing adult she needs. You may be able to help her get help that will bring such adults into her life.", "Nta", "Your mother and stepfather are the assholes. She is a child and it's their job to parent her. But what is going on in the family that this child has gone from clean to unhygenic and well behaved to a thief? There are red flags with her behaviour. You are  a teenager and not well equipped to be dealing with this but please don't cut your sister off. Try and find what is behing her behaviour and flag concerns to her school. Her behaviour is very concerning and some form of abuse springs to mind, You are NTA but neither is she.", "@op you may want to call CPS.  Your sister had serious issues that need to be dealt with before she messes up royally and gets sent to prison.  Get her into a group home or something like it, she's lost her privileges to live with family.", "NTA, but your twelve year old sister isn\u2019t doing this for no reason, and kicking out a child for any reason that young is abandonment and you should be calling the authorities now. Like\u2026 In no way shape or form is kicking out a 12 year old acceptable no matter what she did. Your mother shouldn\u2019t have ever let this happen, and cops need to be called as well as social services. Like yesterday.", "NTA -  She was never your responsibility and you did her a kindness. If she has to deal with the consequences of her actions, so be it. Hopefully she will learn from this and not repeat her behavior.", "This right here OP.  NTA.  You are 20 - take care of yourself for now and don't try to save everyone else.", "I recommend getting CPS involved she has some pretty big issues and parents can\u2019t just kick their kids out at 12"]}
