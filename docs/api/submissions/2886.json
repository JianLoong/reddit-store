{"id": 2886, "submission_id": "z0zyfj", "title": "AITA for kicking out my sister?", "selftext": "(Throwaway account bc I have friends on main) I (20m) have been living with my sister (12f) for about a few months now. Our mother (42f) has remarried and is now legally blind. before her health began to decline in 2018, she took us both to live with her and her new family.\n\nI didn't like our stepdad. In 2020, he took advantage of my mom's health decline to funnel mine and my sister's allowances from our aunt, who started providing money to us bc of our situation (deceased dad and disabled mom left us with basically no money), straight to his own bank account. At some point I decided that I've had enough and that the best course of action was to leave his home and get myself a job since I recently turned 18.\n\nSo within one month, I was living in my own apartment. My sister stayed with our mom.\n\nFlash forward to earlier this year, I got a surprise call from my sister telling me to pick her up from their home bc she got kicked out by our stepdad. When I went and picked her up and her stuff, I asked my sister what happened, she went on about how she was always being blamed for things that she claimed she had nothing to do with, like swiping cash from my stepfamily, and other minor hygiene related issues like leaving dishes with food. She wasn't like this before so I thought they lied to me about her behavior.\n\nWeeks pass and I started noticing that I somehow seemed to always have less cash in my wallet than expected. I also started noticing a stench from my sister's room. At this point I knew everything they said about my sister was true. She took money from me, lied to me about going to school, and somehow got me a warning from my landlord about the stench and \"landfill\" appearance of my once clean aprtmnt. I pushed all my frustrations deep inside me bc I knew that she didn't want to go back to our stepdad's house when I had a talk with her.\n\nThen yesterday, I found out that she stole money from me again. But it wasn't a little bit of money, she took the cash that was supposed to be for bills and spent it all on her every day visit to various fast food stops. Naturally, I got angry and demanded she return what was left of the money only to be told that there was absolutely 0 left. Eventually, I forgave her after scrounging up enough to pay for our due bills but if it happened again, she was out.\n\nToday, I found out she broke my laptop and hid it from me. This absolutely broke me. I worked for my laptop so that I could play my video games and treat myself to a small reprieve every time I get stressed at work. I was so devastated that I packed her bags and brought her back to our mom and stepdad's.\n\nShe's 12. A literal child. And I feel so shitty about leaving her back at our mother's house but at this point idk what to do. Genuinely wondering if what I did was right or if I was being an asshole for kicking out a child.

You did the best that you could.  Sister is not your responsibility.", "Nta she\u2019s not a child committing burglary she\u2019s a pint sized felon lol", "NTA. You are not that child\u2019s parent or legal guardian.", "NTA.  You are not ready to be responsible for a child but you have it a try when you saw your sister needed help.  She on the other hand needs more support than you can provide.  Given the situation at home, she probably needs some counseling and proper parenting.  Good luck.", "NTA. There may be deep psychological reasons she's doing this but your mom needs to step in as the parent, get her to a counselor and...PARENT. You tried, and honestly this isn't on you.", "NTA. However, there might be deeper issues causing your sister to act this way. I think she needs to speak with a counselor or someone she can open up to. Sometimes these behaviours are a cry for help. It's quite unfortunate that she did all those things while staying with you. You said she was never the type to do that. Let's hope it's just from peer pressure and not something in her home that's causing her to act out.", "Look, she\u2019s a 12 year old girl in an unhealthy situation. This is a cry for help. She needs therapy, a stable and safe home structure, and a responsible adult to put in time, money, and effort into teaching her healthy tools and habits while showing her love.\n\nYou are 20 years old. You are still growing and learning yourself. You are also dealing with your own trauma from your upbringing.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if giving your sister what she needs is beyond your capabilities. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to know what to do or even to have the resources to do it.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t step up she\u2019s going back to a home where things are only going to get worse. There is likely no happy ending for your sister.\n\nAnd while that\u2019s not your fault, and you genuinely and truly shouldn\u2019t blame yourself, it is very sad.\n\nI\u2019m not giving a judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your stepdad is a financial abuser and your sister needs therapy, do you think your aunt might be able to help?", "Can you contact the aunt who was sending you money and see if she can help? Can you call CPS with any evidence that they threw out a minor child and see what kind of help they can provide? If they\u2019ve already thrown her out there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll taker her back, she could wind up on the street without somebody helping", "This. Sister sounds troubled, has learnt some bad coping strategies, and needs way more help than OP can provide. \nOP isn\u2019t the AH for not being able to cope, but 12yo who has been dumped in an abusive household isn\u2019t, either.", "Why would you need to guilt trip OP into helping? It is not OP responsibility and she should, by not means, feel responsible, more so, when OP is barely an adult.  She gave the sister a lot it opportunities which she all dismissed, this is not a six year old, at 12 you know exactly what you are doing.\n\nOP, please don\u2019t listen to this person, do the best you can for yourself, don\u2019t look back.

Hmm I wonder where things went wrong.", "I agree the OP isn\u2019t responsible. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that their sister needs help. There\u2019s a ton of trauma in this family. A twelve year old suffering trauma is often going to do so in unhealthy ways, especially if not given the tools/knowledge to do otherwise.\n\nI didn\u2019t give a judgement because this is beyond Reddit and there are no good answers."]}
