I ended up saying \u201cThen go ask Mia for food and stop being so mean to me. This is my money, I can do whatever I want with it.\u201d \n\nHe was really surprised because I never yell and stomped up to his room. I got a text from his dad later asking if I really felt like jewelry was more important than our son.

It's okay to feel sad, and it's okay to take time for yourself and not prioritize making a meal for a 15-year-old (who is very capable of feeding himself).\n\nYour son is 15. It's a cliche to say it's a difficult age, but it is. I'm a teacher of adolescents, I have a whole room full of them all day, and this is a common tactic that they use to manipulate adults: don't get what I want so I'll rub your face in how much better, cooler, and more generous this other adult is who *does* give me what I want.\n\nWith kids this age, it is so often about power and control. They have so little but are craving adult privileges, so they will meet their need for power and control in so many small ways, one of which (and this is what makes adolescents so charming!) is extracting a desired emotional response from an adult. In your case, this is hurting your feelings or making you angry.\n\nIt is so hard but you cannot give it to them! I often defang these responses by stating directly what they're trying to imply. \"Wow, yeah, it sounds like Mia is super cool and nice! I wish I could be that cool, but good for you having someone like her in your life. You're lucky!\"\n\nIn the case of the dinner situation, don't apologize or feel bad. \"Mom, you weren't home to make dinner!\" \"I assumed you were with your friends, so I ran some errands. But there are leftovers in the fridge and \\_\\_\\_ in the freezer for you to make if you're hungry.\" \"But I was looking forward to what you were making!\" \"Good, I'll make it later this week then, so you'll have something to look forward to. In the meantime, if you have a question about fixing your own dinner, let me know. I'll be putting away what I bought in my room.\"\n\nIf a kid is being intentionally hurtful, I won't stand for that, but again, the key is remaining firm and calm. \"That was a really hurtful thing to say. I don't appreciate that.\" Notice I don't ask for anything; that too easily sets up a power struggle.\n\nRegardless, I'm sorry you've been treated this way. That really sucks and you really don't need to feel guilty for feeling sad and overlooked (you are!!!) or taking time for yourself that doesn't put a young adult's whims ahead of all else.", "NTA. Your ex is for coming after you like that. And your kid. Honestly sounds like he's doing it on purpose to get you upset. At 15 he knows well enough. He's also old enough to make his own dinner. You did nothing wrong doing a little self care day since no one else bothered to.", "Did you tell your son the jewelry was your gift to yourself?\n\nWhy not suggest he move in with dad and Mia.  \nIt may alter everyone\u2019s perspective.\n\nHe has taken you granted, is nearly grown, is nasty to you as is your ex.  Seems you making an exit in your own best interest is called for here.  That won\u2019t change the hurt but you opening up new opportunities in life for yourself may soften the sting and help.\n\nChildren of divorce sometime pick a parent and when they do, they tend yo pick the one they perceive as a winner.", "NAH.\n\nYou have a right to feel sad your 15 year old son forgot your birthday, but remembered his step-mom's birthday and seemingly wanted to go \"all out\" for her. You also have a right to use your money the way you want to.\n\nHowever, your son may not have intentionally forgot your birthday to hurt you. He is 15 and often teenagers can be very narrow-minded. There's a lot of reasons why step-mom's birthday may have been top-of-mind for him, the biggest potentially being that bio-dad may have been bringing up step-mom's birthday to your son. I am a step-mom and this has happened in our situation. My husband will remind his daughter about my birthday, but not her bio-mom's birthday, and then bio-mom feels hurt.\n\nI guess if there is any real AH here it might be your ex for calling you selfish without knowing the whole story. In my situation, my husband and BM have an agreement to clarify the whole story with each other before making judgments. This is to avoid some major misunderstandings they've had in the past.", "NTA. Your son sounds incredibly ill-mannered if he can't even say happy birthday and insults you because...you didn't make what he wanted for dinner? Since when it it weird for an adult to buy themselves jewelry if they have the money, and since when is it appropriate for a fifteen year old to tell off an adult for buying themselves something? Your son's dad was also manipulating you with that text, by the way. Maybe your son is spoiled because of how you raised him, or maybe it's because of his father, or both. But you do realize that this is a ridiculous reaction for a 15 year old, right? Your kid started making snide, manipulative remarks because mommy wasn't home to fix his dinner. That's concerning.", "NTA. You slipped, but you can make it up. It sounds like you've kept your bad feelings about Jack's relationship with Mia bottled up, and you need to have a real talk with him about this. I have known teens (especially boys) who were really obtuse about other people's (especially their parents') feelings, and this situation is made harder because of the split-family situation.

You're human, we all have emotions\n\nAnd he choose to come home to see you rather than hang with his friends so even if you made a mistake on this occasion you guys must get on pretty well at other times. I'd also explain what happened on this occasion, he'll understand why you were upset he missed the birthday. \n\nI'm sure you'll figure it out :)", "I wanna know where step dad is in all this. I get he was away on a work trip, but he didnt call and wish her happy birthday? Or text his step son and remind him? \nI understand he had to work but he couldnt have flowers delivered or something?", "My moms birthday has always been forgotten. Its in June so she never got to have a treat at school. But her own PARENTS forgot her birthday every year and she's super sensitive about it so she's always made sure to make birthdays special. Now that I'm an adult there isn't a single birthday of hers that she doesnt get a happy birthday and a cake she didn't have to go buy herself. Even when I am flat broke I always set aside enough money to get her favorite cake from her favorite bakery. As a result of her trauma I make sure birthdays are special for my loved ones. Having your birthday forgotten sucks.", "Perfect!", "Yeah, or is he part of the reason Op feels like it's stupid to expect acknowledgement of a birthday, or selfish for saying how she feels....", "[removed]", "If I were you  , I would show this post to the son. He needs to see and realise how much he's hurting you. He forgot his birthday. You are mad but never told him. For him it's just like you exploded and neglected him out of nowhere. You need to tell him.", "Did you told your son that the reason you bought the jewellery is bc everybody forgot about your b-day and you wanted to made this up to yourself? If not, tell him. Make sure he knows this is not an offence at him and you are not mad at anybody, just a little sad noone remembered and thats why you wanted to treat yourself. \n\nHe will get at least two valuables lessons from this. Carelessness can hurt ppl he loves and its ok to look after yourself if everybody else forgets about you. Sure, he will feel guilty a little, but right so. He will add your bday to his calender, problem solved. Also you will prevent him from certain arguments with his future bfs/gfs since the first thing he will do is adding their bday to his calender to avoid hurting more ppl he loves by accident :)\n\nNTA", "NTA, you bought a birthday gift for yourself. Your son is old enough to fix food for himself. Spending some time to enjoy yourself is not selfish. Your son needs to know what you bought was a birthday gift to yourself.", "YTA. I encourage you to examine your self esteem issues. You are allowed to have feelings and expectations on how you should be treated. What makes you feel like your feelings are stupid? Why do you think that being grown means you shouldn't \"throw a fuss\"? You think you shouldn't have emotion to the point that you \"felt bad for feeling sad.\"\n\nYou are so afraid of being abandoned that you are pushing your son away. You didn't tell him your plans and he reacted poorly to you not being home. You snapped at him. Told him to go be with Mia and that he was mean to you.\n\nThe truth is that it sounds like you don't tell people what you want or what you don't like. Then you allow them to treat you badly without an ounce of protest until you snap. But they never knew you didn't like the way you were treated. They aren't mind readers. \n\nIf you were only interacting with adults then I would say you are N.T.A. because you are in need of communication and coping skills and I would gently encourage you to seek help. \n\nBut you are a mom being passive aggressive with your child. He does not understand your mood swings or have any coping mechanisms of his own. You are responsible for him and you are the adult. \n\nYou need to get help now. Passive aggression is still aggression! It is not healthy for your son to get this sort of emotional whiplash. You both need therapy to help you gain the coping and communication skills you need. In\n\nEdit to add: I think you need to see how down you are on yourself in the comments:\n\n\"It's stupid for me...,\" \n\n\"I'm in my thirties, I'm not a child,\" \n\nYou call yourself \"stupid and insecure, \n\n\"I just feel extra insecure sometimes,\"\n\n\"I'm being weird and insecure,\"\n\n\"He's got better things to do\"\n\nYou deserve better from yourself. They say everyone is the hero of their own story. But you see yourself as the villain. Everything is not your fault. You don't have to be perfect to be successful. Take the time to say how you feel. It is so scary because I'm guessing your feelings have been invalidated your whole life. But your feelings are valid. It is okay to have feelings. You are a good person and a loving mother. You need to find the strength to face yourself in the mirror and love the person staring back at you. You are loveable. Once you love yourself it is easier to believe that other people can love you. You can let your son love you without the fear.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You need to communicate and at the same time you will be teaching him what happens when people don\u2019t openly tell each other\u2019s feelings they fester. Please talk to your son. I would like to hear that you have worked this out.", "You're in your thirties and not a child, but yet you ARE hurt. Tell him.", "As your son gets older your relationship should change. You should treat him like an Adult more and more. When he was younger is was more natural to hid these things but as he gets older you should talk to him. \n\nSon I was kinda hurt by your actions. Did you know it was my birthday? I didn't expect anything but it would have been nice if you had mentioned it. Also I deserve nice things too. I buy you all of these things. I deserve things for myself.\n\n And who is your husband to judge you and make you feel bad? He certainly knows what things to say and how to push your buttons. And I bet he tells his son the same stuff. Don't let him bully you. I think it might be good to get some therapy. I bet your exhusband tore you down a lot.", "Why would you apologize to him? You did not expect him home early. Please don't apologize. He needs to apologize to you!", "This would be a great answer."]}
