That our culture means nothing to me. It seemed to shock them a lot and I have moved out. They messaged me calling me a disappointment for what I said.\n\nCulture is not static. It used to be a part of Chinese culture to apply footbinding to young girls resulting in pain and disability. That component of Chinese culture has fortunately been eradicated. And it sounds like the social control components of your parents culture is ripe to be changed as well.\n\nInstead of rejecting your parents culture entirely an alternative path could be to take the good components of the culture you have inherited and leave the bad components on the ash heap of history.

Fellow seas here, in my culture, the groom has to provide certain amount of gold and money for the bride's family, so I understand where you are coming from. My opinion is that your parents might focus on the culture part as 'I don't care about the whole culture,' (and seas parents have their own generation traumas about culture and so on) when (I assume) you actually meant 'marital culture.' \n\nAnd yes, the tradition of parent granting their adult daughter permission to marry is the first cultural part that has to go in my list.", "Only you can make your choices, because you have to live with them.

But I'm sure that, even though they'll deny it, they had some unkind responses to their parents at your age too.

Your parents argued with you until you were in a place where you had very few options for a response, and pretty much *none* that they would have accepted. (The only one they would've liked was a fantasy and never going to happen.) Responding in a harsh manner when you've been badly provoked is what almost anybody would do. They can't really be surprised, and odds are good that they'll get over the exaggerated shock in time.\n\nDo you care if they're disappointed in you for having this opinion?", "NTA.

Obviously, NTA. \n\nI live in the US but also come from a Southeast Asian culture (My parents and I immigrated when I was really young). It was really tough to navigate through the cultural divide that we had. I know from firsthand experience, it\u2019s not as easy to go against a culture you\u2019ve known and follow people saying \u201cyou\u2019re grown, you can do whatever you want.\u201d\n\nWhat is important is that you find a balance between firmly placing your boundaries, but also knowing this culture is what your parents know and all they have ever known.\n\nMy sibling moved out with their American boyfriend which caused a lot of tension between them and my parents. My parents are traditional and believe you must be married before moving in together and marriage is reserved for a certain age. As a result, my dad did not talk to my sibling for three months. My sibling firmly stood their ground and although it was rough, they stuck it out in the end.\n\nEveryone\u2019s parents and cultures are different. Finding that balance is key. Although, this is assuming you still want contact with them. Going no contact is valid as well. Good luck, OP!", "NTA. Continue to stand up for your interests.", "NTA.

Not the permission part obviously.", "NTA, they are disappointed that they cannot manipulate you into doing what they want because, culture.

The are pissed that you will not sacrifice your financial future to pay for them when they want to retire early. They are just worried you may not fall in line when they tell you how much you owe them for raising you. How you are now responsible for all their wants and needs because they had to raise the child they made. You owe them for the fact they had to do the bare minimum and parent the child they wanted.", "NTA. Someone has to break the chain of old outdated thinking. You go Girl!"]}
