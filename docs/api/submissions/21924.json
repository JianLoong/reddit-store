(this is the start of the guilt/manipulation)\n\nOP:  Plans with my SO.\n\nFriend:  Excuses, guilt trips, manipulation, gaslighting, \"it's so hard being a mother\", etc etc\n\nI really hope your friend doesn't do this to you.", "NTA. You need to be clear and firm and stand up for yourself. No means no and you had other plans.", "NTA.  But she may have accepted our no, and may be just be asking a curious question about when his flight is due.  Why do you assume she is asking you for an explanation?", "NTA. Tell them no and leave it at that. Any further dialogue creates holes that some people like to try and use to needle you into relenting.

No is a complete sentence. It's also fine to just not reply to her until, like, right before you meet up with your partner. \"OMG I totally forgot this message was here.

If you're good friends that response may just be her continuing the conversation. All you need to do is respond in a friendly way that also makes it clear that you're busy all day. \"X's plane gets in at 7! I'm so excited to see them and spend the day with them, it feels like ages since we've had time together\" You don't NEED to give reasons to not babysit, but you also don't need to withhold info from your good friend about things going on in your life. Of course, if this \"friend\" has a history of trying to weasel around your boundaries, feel free to give a harsher response, like \"X's plane gets in at 7, but I'll be busy all morning getting ready for them. Hope you can find alternative child care!\"", "NTA and I think I can say the same response to so many of these posts.  **No one is entitled to your time or money**, unless you are in a relationship where you have worked out terms for this (business/job, spouse, etc.).  Everything else is you doing something for somone you care about as a nice thing to do or a favor.  If they start taking advantage, feeling entitled to it, or only interact with you to get your time or money, then you can and need to push back. If the relationship can't survive any push back, it wasn't really solid anyway.  Much harder to do than say- but you will be so much better off if you enforce this boundary and find people who respect it.", "NTA. She\u2019s taking advantage.

She's wanting this conversation so she can try to force you into changing your mind and doing what she wants.   \n\nNormal people, hearing you are meeting someone at the airport, know that you will be busy for hours and hours, just because it's airport stuff.
