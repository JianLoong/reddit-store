She's been a great friend and I don't mind babysitting sometimes. However my partner is coming back from a trip today and I was planning on spending the day together. I asked for the day off at work. She asked yesterday if I could babysit today and told her that I planned on meeting my partner at the airport. She then asked what time is the arrival. And I didn't reply yet. Because I feel like I shouldn't have to give explanations? If she said \"I really need this and couldn't find anyone\", I would do it. But she didn't add anything so I don't want to ask how much does she need the babysitting because I really don't want to do it today.

Babysitting is something you do as a favour, not an obligation, and you have your own plans for the day.

So far, she asked you to babysit, and you said no. If she digs in later, then that may change, but as of now, everything seems to be above board.", "NTA. You also have your own personal life. Besides, you told her that you probably couldn't do it.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s very last minute and she\u2019s not considering you at all. You said no. Tell her you are unavailable for the entire day. You\u2019re right in thinking that you don\u2019t need to give her an explanation.", "NTA\n\nIf your friendship is ruined because you're not at her beck and call for *free* babysitting, then you were never friends in the first place.", "Just say no. You are busy. It's not hard.", "NTA. You\u2019re not running a daycare and she\u2019s not entitled to childcare. Don\u2019t give detail, she may just try to make excuses. Enjoy your time with your partner", "NTA. Parents need to realize that not everyone can drop everything to babysit for them every time. You're really looking forward to this day and took the day off work for it, so enjoy the day! Honestly you don't even need a reason, a simple no is all that should be required. If turning down babysitting ruins the friendship, then that says a lot about them and the friendship to begin with.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe your friend babysitting. Ever. \n\nYou took the day off from work, which means either you are taking PTO or losing a day\u2019s pay. You did not choose to do that in order to give her free childcare.\n\nJust tell her that you have plans for the day. If she pushes to know what the plans are, just tell her that you can\u2019t change your plans on such short notice. If she pushes more, just keep repeating that a) you have plans and b) you can\u2019t change them. Do not specify what the plans are.\n\nThe reason she\u2019s asking the time of arrival, as I suspect you\u2019ve guessed, is because she is trying to see if she can get you to babysit for at least part of the day. \n\nIf you give her *any* information, she will use that to pressure you into doing what she wants.\n\nIf you were working all day, she\u2019d find another solution, wouldn\u2019t she? \n\nPeople tend to choose the solution that is easiest for them. Right now, you are her easiest solution. You need to give her a hard, firm \u201cno,\u201d and let her move on to her next easiest solution.\n\nIt really sounds as if she just wants a day off from parenting. You must certainly do not have to give up your day off, that you want to spend with your partner who has been away, to watch her child.", "NTA. You tried to politely decline indicating the reason, meaning your partner returns today you\u2019re going to the airport\u2026 She became an asshole when she asked what time is the arrival.

This is a kindness you are doing for her.\n\nIf your friend is a reasonable person, she should be able to accept that you sometimes can't babysit (esp on a 1 day notice).\n\nBe honest, but clear \"I can't babysit today, I'm sorry\"", "NTA just say the same thing you did here, you\u00b4ll be spending the whole day with your partner and it is not possible for you to babysit. You don\u00b4t have to explain more.", "NAH\n\nI'd ask her if it's really an emergency. If it is an emergency then I'd help her out, that's what friends are for.

If I were in a position where I really needed to ask a friend, even if I was absolutely desperate, them saying no for absolutely any reason would be absolutely fine with me. \n\nNow if she hasn't mentioned the reason or how importantly she needs a sitter, could her asking about the time your partner gets in just be here trying to show interest/making conversation, I'm assuming had she asked this while not previously asking for you to babysit, you wouldn't be suspicious of the question. \n\nAND even if she is asking in the hopes you could still do it, it's totally ok to still say you can't. \n\nIn your shoes I would simply reply with the time and say how you cannot wait to see your partner.\n\nIF she tries to ask if you can make it work around that a simple \"sorry we've got plans together for the day\" is more than acceptable.", "NTA.\n\nThere is no way you could be the asshole in this situation.

Has she responded to you yet?", "I'm not good at communicating how I feel usually so I get dragged into doing things I don't feel like doing to not let her down. However we have very different personality styles. I'm an introvert that gets energy in solitude and she gets energy from being around people.

As someone who is an introvert (+ has social anxiety,depression and adhd) it is tough to set boundaries.
