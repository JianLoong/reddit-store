Jamie (22F) and Hannah (25F). Jamie and I have the same parents, but Hannah has a different dad. That hasn\u2019t really affected us much growing up, as my dad Damian (46M) adopted her when she was a baby.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and Hannah and my dad don\u2019t talk anymore because he is a very manipulative and selfish person. He constantly feels the need to make himself the victim. The reason they don\u2019t talk anymore is because when I was 11, my dad told me he thought my sisters career would never go anywhere and that she was being stupid for thinking it would. Since I was a kid, I immediately told my sister and that was her final straw.\n\nJamie and I still try to maintain somewhat of a relationship with our dad, just because we just want to try.\n\nI recently went through drivers ed, which if you don\u2019t know is very expensive. Before I even went to class, my mom texted my dad to make sure he would help pay for it which he promised he would. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago my class ended, and my dad still hadn\u2019t paid a cent. My mom messaged him to ask him to pay it, and word for word, this was his response.\n\n\u201cWel Ashton and Hannah hate me. Atleast Jamie has a heart but Ashton and Hannah wouldn\u2019t even come to my funeral. Ashton ruined my life and is the reason Hannah doesn\u2019t talk to me anymore. Congratulations, you got what you want. The kids hate me and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very nice to you.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that I honestly hadn\u2019t talked to him in a while before this, so I don\u2019t really know where he got this from. And the last time we hung out was with Jamie, so I don\u2019t know why she was favourited.\nMy mom replied,\n\n\u201cDamian the relationship you have with our children is 100% on you, there is nothing I can do or they can do to change how they feel about you. Hannah not talking to you is your own fault, you do not get to live in this fantasy world where you\u2019re constantly the victim.\u201d\n\nTo which he replied,\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fantasy, it\u2019s just how it is. He isn\u2019t getting a penny from me when he doesn\u2019t even care about me.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve been more confused if anything. I haven\u2019t done anything or said anything to him that would give him this impression, I think he\u2019s just saying it because he\u2019s mad at me for something I did 6 years ago. But whatever it is, I don\u2019t wanna deal with it. He\u2019s tried to text and call but I haven\u2019t even read them, I\u2019m honestly really done.\n\nBut, my grandma and step mom have also been bombarding me with texts. A few of them which I read, most of them were just saying \u201cWow, you\u2019re really gonna make him lose another kid? He does everything for you.\u201d (My mom does and has paid for everything for us for the past 7 years, he doesn\u2019t even pay his child support anymore.)\n\nI just want to make sure that there is no way here that I am in the wrong, so Am I The Asshole?", "created_utc": 1686113098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1433jw4/aita_for_refusing_to_speak_to_my_dad_after_i/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By telling the truth to your sister, six years ago, about what he said? *You ruined his life?*\n\nWow. Such power you wield, OP! I wish I had your ability. Imagine the havoc I could cause!

He wants to be the victim and is trying to gaslight you into believing it.  \n\n\nThat being said, I'll bet this isn't out of the blue.  I'd be willing to bet that it has something to do with your sister. He may have tried to reach out to her or something, or something reminded him of her and that reminded him of you telling her what he said.   \n\n\nJust remember, he's so out there that he will blame an 11 yr old before he will take an ounce of responsibility for what happened. It was all his fault and he just can't handle that fact.", "NTA - he sounds like a deadbeat and a very unhealthy person emotionally for you. He\u2019d rather torpedo your relationship and start drama than fork out some cash for something you needed. That is so manipulative it\u2019s crazy.

What is wrong with her pulling you into the middle of they\u2019re crap? Second, forget about your dad. He\u2019s just being a brat. Just remember sometime in your future years this is no way to treat your children. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going the this. Focus on your education, plan a career path out, and always drive carefully!", "\ud83d\udcaf% NTA. He ruined his own life and destroyed his own relationships and now makes a desperate attempt to reconnect?!\n\nHe actually sounds at least severely depressed. Perhaps rightfully so. Does he have addiction issues too (as his text sounds potentially drunk)? Not that it changes anything, except perhaps to see him in a less evil light - living with your own consequences can really suck sometimes. Especially when you know you\u2019re the one that dug the hole.\n\nSo, you\u2019re definitely NTA and not obligated to help at all. But, if you feel compelled or sympathetic and want to help, make sure to protect yourself too and not be dragged down into his self-created cesspool.", "NTA.  Dad's 46?   So basically, he's still a kid himself.  Kids do and say stupid shit.  Especially when they're slow developers.  Cut him a little slack.  Emphasis on little.  He does need to grow the fuck up eventually.  \n\nNow a word to you.  You're pretty young yourself.  Dare i say baby.  You will very likely take fukn forever to grow up too.  Something to think about.  \n\nStill NTA though.", "Then i cant help you.", "I don't know why you're being involved in this slap fight to begin with.", "Seems like your social skills need some focused attention.  \n\nYes.  46 in today's world still a borderline kid.
