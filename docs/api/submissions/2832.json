Absolutely awful experience. Luckily (?) she was older and could scream for help and hit the dog off. A newborn or a toddler couldn\u2019t do that. If my kid had been a small child she wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nYou are so, SO NTA.\n\nETA if your partner needs convincing further hit me up and I\u2019ll send you some pictures of her injuries. She is still deeply traumatised and terrified of dogs. This dog was an Alsatian and had never bitten before, but had lunged at people. I love dogs but would never have one around a small child or a baby.", "Unfortunately, NTA. I wish there was another way. If your family has time to blame you, perhaps one of them should step up to take care of the dog instead.", "NTA. I volunteer with rescues and there are some dogs that, sadly, cannot be helped. It\u2019s not too common but Ive known rescues to make the hard choice to put the dog down so it will finally know peace. \n\nI love dogs. LOVE. Like a crazy amount, but the safety of your family HAS to come first.", "NTA. We adopted a shelter pit bull who\u2019d been abused as a pup, and he was aggressive around strangers and other animals. We thought he was just being protective of us and kept him away from people and critters. He bit two people, but we didn\u2019t want to euthanize him. It finally happened. Out of the blue one afternoon he suddenly attacked me and almost killed me. We tried to find a no-kill shelter that would take him, but nobody would take him. We understood and have to have him put down. We knew he loved us and we loved him, but I knew I couldn\u2019t be alone with him any more. If my husband hadn\u2019t pulled him off me I\u2019d be dead now. My surgeon told me it was a miracle the dog didn\u2019t kill me. It broke our hearts, but we couldn\u2019t take the risk any more.\nYou are most definitely justified in your fears. It\u2019s too much of a risk. Take my word on this. I\u2019ll send pictures of my scars if you want to use them as part of your case.\nOh, and if your home insurance company finds out you knowingly kept a dog that has a history of aggression, they will cancel your homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance. It happened to us and it was a huge mess.", "NTA.  If you rehomed her and she attacked someone else's kid, how would you feel?  If you rehomed her and she was aggressive, her new owners might physically abuse her or chain her outside to live alone in the yard.  As someone who worked in animal rescue for years, I can tell you that in certain circumstances euthanasia can be the most humane choice for the animal.", "NTA \n\nThe dog has multiple instances of attack towards other animals, and aggression towards children. You CANNOT have that dog around your child.\n\nNTA", "NTA the rest of the family is quick to judge you about it but not quick to take the dog themselves.", "\"and family\" ... none of whom is offering to take the dog?\n\nSad but NTA", "You are NTA. My son thought the same about an adopted rescue dog and it mauled him without warning. He was lucky that his damage and scarring are not worse.

I grew up with a snappy dog (never got bit but had lots of rules to abide by so she didn\u2019t bite me) and looking back I don\u2019t know why my parents allowed it. \n\nAs sad as you might be over this you have to protect your baby. Your niece did nothing to provoke the dog before being attacked, as per your previous comments, and the dog is now older and more likely to be grumpy. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with the fallout of this, but I do think it is the best idea to put your dog down", "NTA - Biting twice at your niece is one too many.", "NTA. Dog aggression typically comes from certain environments and as well as issues with the dog. Not knowing where your partners dad got the dog leaves a lot of assumptions to be made. While you can send dogs to canine behavior classes to try and curb or suppress aggressive behavior, it\u2019s still an animal that can think and act on its own. Even a well trained dog can react negatively to certain stimuli. I know this first hand. I have a working K9 that I trust with my life. However while he is very friendly with people, he is not allowed out when my wife and daughter have guest over if I\u2019m not home. They don\u2019t know how to read dog behaviors or tell if he\u2019s getting stressed like I can. \nI would not recommend rehoming because now you are taking this aggressive behavior and sending it else where and it\u2019s not a smart decision unless the dog goes to someone that knows what they are doing. It\u2019s a tough call but you are making the right decision.", "NTA and I know you're probably heartbroken over this, but you're making the right choice given your circumstances. You cannot have this dog around your baby. It's terribly terribly sad, but she can't be trusted, and someone has to be the one who's thinking reasonably about your situation. I saw your comment that everyone has shit to say but no help to give. Tell those people they can come over to your house, either to take the dog or to say their goodbyes to her.", "Nta", "NTA please show your husband these comments. I feel awful for the dog but you are taking a big risk.", "NTA. The right thing to do with an aggressive animal is to euthanize it. It is unacceptable to put your future child or anyone else that may come in contact with the dog in danger. There are too many stories of children being mauled to death by a dog to justify not euthanizing it.", "NTA! I had to do the something similar. I had my dog for 2 years and she just got aggressive more and more. The last fight I broke up, I ended up in the hospital. (Not from either dog) but she wouldn't let us go in the kids room, we weren't allowed to laugh. Or gasp. For 1 month we walked on egg shells. My husband and I finally decided the best thing was to put her down. - I couldn't dare rehome her knowing how she was turning mean with laughter, loud noises, so kids were out of the question. Then my mind went to even yo a home with no live in kids, what if kids visit. I didn't trust her to not turn on them one day.  It was what was best for her and I do not regret it. I miss her but I'm at peace knowing she's not being used as a bait dog, attacking other pets or maybe humans.", "NTA. Too many toddler and babies are permanently scarred or killed by aggressive dogs. If he's already been aggressive he doesn't need to be around babies.\n\nIf they are so worried tell them to either take the dog now or they can STFU. It's your dog, your home, your baby and your say. I'd tell the next relative who harrrassws you about it to come pick up and keep the dog themselves.", "NTA. As a former animal shelter worker, this is the sort of dog that is almost impossible to safely rehome. Even if you could find someone who will never have a child in their home, the dog has to go outside at times and what happens if it encounters a child then? And it is a clear threat to your baby so please don't listen to your partner or family members in this. Every dog attack where the dog bit a second time involved someone who was unwilling to put that dog down. In some cases, the person the dog bit died. Don't let that happen to your child.", "NTA. Sometimes behavioral euthanasia is the kindest thing we can do. There are options of basket muzzles, extensive training and medications but looking at the quality of Life and safety of other pets and people, it necessary. Hugs!!", "NTA\n\nSadly, this dog cannot be trusted. There might be a chance that training would lessen the dog's aggressiveness, but there is also a chance that training won't help. \n\nDon't risk your baby. If a shelter won't take the dog, euthanasia is the best option.", "NTA. I would love to see you surrender doggo to a shelter that can handle her, but she's got enough of a history with other animals that there probably isn't a shelter in the universe that can handle her. You've done your due diligence, and here's the thing about aggressive dogs: they're aggressive because they're *scared*. A dog that lashes out and tries to attack everything is afraid of everything, and that's no way to live. Having her put down sucks, and it would be great if somebody had the resources to rehabilitate her, but sometimes it's the most merciful thing for a really violent dog.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry there isn\u2019t an alternative solution. I would try to find a dog behavior specialist or a rescue group to take her in and rehabilitate her, but it sounds like you\u2019ve tried that. If your dad was already going to have her euthanized, I am not sure how you trying to help for as long as you could keep her makes you the asshole. You did\u2019t adopt this dog initially and you are no longer able to have her safely in your home.", "NTA- so sorry you are dealing with this. Take note that none of your relatives want to offer to step back in (bc they\u2019re aware of the poor dog\u2019s aggressive behavior). \n\nThis dog has a history of attacking an infant/toddler already, imagine the potential consequence of keeping it in the house especially as it gets older. This isn\u2019t easy, but your future infant needs to be safe and you have to be comfortable in your own home.", "NTA. Whoever feels bad about your decision should take the dog in themselves and deal with it. Otherwise you\u2019re not obligated to keep it in your home with new children. I\u2019m sure the mother who just lost her two young babies to their dog attacking them would\u2019ve done things differently as well. Trust your gut on this one.", "Here to join the chorus of NTA. There has been too many deaths and injuries of children by dogs where the owners believe it would never happen because the dogs were only aggressive to non-family members. It's not worth the risk.", "NTA. You were kind enough to take her but you can see it's an accident waiting to happen. If no one else is prepared to take her on and pay for the professional dog behaviourist she needs, they don't have a right to complain.", "NTA!!! Protect your baby!! Everyone has opinions but NONE of them have taken her!! When I had my first daughter we had two pit mixes, they were extremely loveable dogs with no history of aggression and I still worried and watched them around her as a baby because you never know how a dog will react. Thankfully they never showed any aggression towards her and ended up being extremely loving and gentle with her up until the days they passed...but that isnt always the case, you just NEVER know!! You're honestly making the most humane choice for the dog, especially since she has showed signs of aggression and has nipped your niece already.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can keep the dog away from a child, make it an outdoor pen with a warm house, or a section of the house that the dog is in and the child not.  We are everything to these animals, and when they are not raised properly, we kill them instead of helping them or taking extra time.  It's depressing.", "NTA.

I know how to read my dog and can tell when he\u2019s stressed or getting mentally elevated, my wife and daughter do not. It\u2019s a safety thing. If my dog bites you it won\u2019t be a nip, it won\u2019t be a quick bite and let go, he\u2019s going to bite you and hold on until he\u2019s given to command to release.", "What kind of dog is it?

Many times the aggression is born from something - usually fear or anxiety.\n\nThis is not a good quality of life for them because the only response they have in uncomfortable situations is to bite and that doesn\u2019t make them happy. Most dogs don\u2019t want to bite, but they have no other outlet\u2026 so they use what they have, and while yes dogs generally show signs, they can progress from uncomfortable body language to a snap in an instant (I\u2019ve had that misfortune personally).\n\nA new child is a huge change. You won\u2019t be able to give the pup the attention she had prior, and that will cause her stress. Her behavior is likely to worsen if anything. Her quality of life will go down as her anxiety/fear in such a situation goes up.\n\nBehavioral euthanasia is never fun, but with a bite history with a child, I\u2019d agree fully. I give some leeway with provoked snaps (pulled dogs tail or ear - then maybe would do fine in a home without kids), but generally, I trust an owner when they come to a decision like this with said history.\n\nI euthanized an 8 month dog once for aggression.

The dog LUNGED at these kids. We had to wrestle the dog to the ground as the kids ran and she was on a leash! We couldn't have house guests with kids couldn't go any where there might be kids. Because we were so limited on where we could go and what we could do she got more and more aggressive. She started to hate me and growl at me and snapped at me several times. My husband at the time was adamant we couldn't just abandon her. Even when our neighbor stopped by and she bit his arm and clamped down. Luckily he was wearing his military uniform and she only got his sleeve but we had to choke her and drag her to the other room. But husband was convinced only garbage people get rid of their pets as many people are. Even when I brought it up to friends and family who were all terrified of the dog they would act shocked that I wanted to grt rid of it. \n\nFinally he got orders and we had to move across country. The idea of driving across the country with a dog that literally couldn't be let outside when a kid was in its eyesight and would absolutly attack someone if they approached her wrong was terrifying. A huge liability and I was honestly scared she would get upset and attack us in the car. We didn't know how we would even get her in a crate. I told him I would fly home to my family and he could go live on the other side of the country with his dog because I wasn't going to live a life revolving around that dog. He agreed and we took her to a rescue that agreed she would not be adopted out to anyone. She just wasn't compatible with modern life. She stayed at the rescue with only adults for the rest of her life sadly and I sometimes wonder if it would have been kinder to just euthanize even with how nice the rescue was. \n\nSome dogs just cannot be helped.

In reality, this is just... not possible in the vast majority of cases. Very few people are actually equipped to take on a dog like this and the responsibilities that come with it's stewardship, and they are few and far between. Rescues and shelters are already running over capacity. They want to make sure the animals they take in are animals they can easily find homes for, not ones that require serious behavioural modification training and run the risk of taking up space for long periods of time that could have gone to countless others. It is an unfortunate reality that people simply do not like to face.\n\nI have no idea the circumstances around which this aggression originated - maybe this is aggression due to fear, due to improper socialization as a pup, or due to breed-specific behaviours exacerbated by its environment. Sometimes, you can indeed address the cause and fix this behaviour, but some dogs just can't be helped. I am presuming that when you took her in, you also did your best to address this aggression through training and mitigation. You seem to be very aware that this also is absolutely a lifelong process in which you must be constantly vigilant knowing that a dog like this will never be 100% safe. You cannot have a dog like this around children.\n\nI think you already know in your heart that it is time to say goodbye.\n\nSometimes, as in this case, it means putting an animal to sleep, giving it the final mercy of peace. Better this way, in your arms and surrounded by your love, than the alternatives - being frightened and alone in an animal control facility after a serious attack on a human being, or, god forbid, being shot by a cop responding to a 911 call about a dog attack.

I came over frequently enough to see him, but most others didn't even know they had a dog. My cousins' friends weren't allowed in the garage or backyard. I was the fourth kid the dog had attacked, but the first unprovoked attack on someone the dog was familiar with. My uncle put it down the next day but my cousins blamed me for it.\n\nAs an adult, I had to boycott my parents' home because their 2yo dog had bitten five people, all women and children, and two of the women ended up in the hospital. I was being \"mean and thoughtless\" because I refused to go into their home or bring my kids over, even if they put the dog outside, until it was rehomed or euthanized. They got this dog as a puppy and it was never abused; if anything, it was pampered. They even did a whole year of training. I'm pretty sure it was just an inbred, psychotic dog of an already aggressive breed. They could not find one rescue or shelter that would even begin to consider taking the dog after hearing the bite history. Had to be euthanized.

I don't think a dog who has bitten should automatically be euthanised. It's akin to saying a person who has been in a fight should be put down. There are different levels of bites, and if a dog has \"nipped/tried to bite\" that's very low level. If a dog intends to cause damage, it will usually succeed. These incidents sound like warnings.\n\nMany dogs dislike being around children and/or other animals. When pushed into those situations, it can lead to bites. \"Gentle\" children can still be incredibly difficult/impossible for some dogs to tolerate. \n\nThat said, this dog clearly isn't going to be happy in your home with a baby. Meaning it won't be safe, I agree. If you have genuinely exhausted all avenues, then euthanasia might be the only option. BUT if you've only contacted a couple of places and just assumed that nowhere will take the dog, then soft YTA. Personally I would be contacting every single place you can find with a copy and pasted message explaining the situation and time limit. \n\nI'm sorry you've ended up in this situation though, and family members who are criticising should be offering help with trying to find somewhere suitable if they feel so passionately.", "NTA I\u2019ve been there.

You should work with a rescue to find an adult home or home with someone with teenagers.\n\nIf a dog and a child don't get along you don't \"try it again\". \n\nI grew up with a dog that just was nervous around babies and so whenever there was a baby around, I would baby get the dog in another room, or crate the dog so the dog wouldn't be stressed out. The worst thing that ever happened was the dog tried to bite the back of the diapers of toddlers running around and that was it. I didn't let the dog around tiny children. It was a very gentle dog that never bit anyone or did anything wrong but I wasn't going to take a chance.\n\nSome dogs just are startled by the quick movements of little people or for whatever reason. You think the child is gentle but lots of little children go toward the dog even being gentle with their hand over the dog's head and a lot of dogs don't like that.\n\nSometimes we ignore a dog's body language, the dog licking their lips, looking away either by moving their whole head away or using avoidant body language or seeing the whites of their eyes a lot. It is a sign they are nervous and most people don't pick up on that and come to their dog's rescue\n\nNow there are dogs that are nervous around kids but when they have their own baby so to speak they are very protective.

After a month or so, the pitbull started showing aggression to the staff.\n\nWe had a difficult conversation with our vet, and we all agreed that this wasn't going to work, the dog was fear aggressive and there was zero chance that he would turn around or that we would find a sanctuary that would take blind dogs with a bite history.

It\u2019s not her fault and I feel it\u2019s kinda the asshole thing to do to kill her for it. You\u2019re NOT the asshole to want to protect your baby whatsoever. And I think it would be best for her to be rehomed. \n\nI would encourage you to see if there\u2019s any local dog sanctuaries that would take her. I could help you search if you like! I know one in South Carolina for example if you live there. I think there\u2019s a lot of passionate people out there who might help. Personally I would just try reaching out a little more before you choose euthanasia. Especially since your partner and family have fondness for the dog.", "OP, walk don't run to get this done. It's sad, but not worth the life of other people, especially your child. One of our friends had a dog that nipped at our child several times. They always had an excuse as to why, so we kept our child away from the dog. Then one day it bit another person's kid, requiring stitches. They realized (she was pregnant), their kid could get hurt and rehomed the dog to a family out in the country without kids.\n\nBut their dog hadn't killed other animals. \n\nI would stop telling people about it and just do it.", ">I volunteer with rescues and there are some dogs that, sadly, cannot be helped.\n\nI see way too many YouTube videos about \"aggressive\" dogs being rehabilitated through a rescue program.  The dog should have been, in my opinion, given up to rescue for evaluation and help.  You of all people should know there are no bad dogs; just bad training.", "There are some prisons that will take a dog like this and train them and are very successful.  You wouldn\u2019t want the dog around children.", "Oh I was so relieved when this was the top comment. I love animals, but sadly some animals can not be helped to overcome their behaviors like this, and if the dog was put in a home it would just stay in there until it died, was adopted and returned time and time again, or made to be euthanized from attacking another animal or child.\n\nBest of a bad situation.

I got her at 6wks of age and she was very gently raised until I had to put her down when she was 13 due to cancer.\nShe hated kids. All kids. Any kid under about 10 she looked at as food. It was a huge responsibility to have her. My Vet said there really is something to, \"The Dingo ate my baby\"! He explained she was the equivalent of a Wolf Hybrid and I'd have to be on guard with her continually. Aside from her kid aggression, she was a great dog. Smartest dog I've ever owned and it broke my heart to lose her, but I'll never take on another dog with breed aggressive tendencies again.", "Nobody has made an effort in finding a shelter/rescue/new home besides me because everyone besides me believes I should keep the dog.

Didn\u2019t think so. \n\nBut you\u2019re right I should have given her away to someone random without disclosing any of her history and let the dog become their problem.", "What a stupid take this is.\u2026", "You can guess but your guess is probably as good as mine, she is a wired hair  mix of some sort. no dna was ever done the dad was wiry haired and medium size mom was some kind of German shepherd mix.

He was sweet a lot of the time, but would just snap at other times. \n\nMy dad tried everything, and his last resort was to take him to a police training facility. The one where they use the large padded suits to be safe. The police trainer told my father to euthanize our dog, because he was so aggressive they couldn't handle him. In fact, they told my dad that if they had not been wearing the suit, he could have torn their arm off. He was 6 months old and we had him in training since he was 10 weeks old, and he had never been hit or abused \n\nWhile I believe most dogs are able to be rehabilitated, your comment is ignorant at best.", "No. A sweeping statement like that is absolutely incorrect. Which is why I said it was rare that rescues do it, but it can happen and when it does, it\u2019s literally the only choice. Believe what you want but doesn\u2019t make you correct. Also, many rescues are beyond capacity right now due to many reasons, (but mostly increased costs of living creating housing issues for humans and dogs) IF they accept an animal it will likely not be an animal with known bite issues (biting children and animals) and low likelihood of adoption.\n\nETA: I never said these were bad dogs. Some dogs just can\u2019t be helped, no matter how much time and money you put into them. There\u2019s something broken inside them and they will always be an injury/mauling/death risk. Not knowing the difference between animal that needs better training (and if you want to get technical, it\u2019s the humans that need the training most) and something that is non-correctable is really very dangerous to both humans and dogs.", "You can't love or train away a genetic issue, chemical imbalance, brain injury, or deep trauma. You are correct that sometimes, the issue can be fixed. The key word is sometimes. Dogs are a domestic animal. We made them to be okay with being around us. Even dogs bred for protection and bite work have a recall and obey their owner. (And that's even more important in those breeds, as you can't have a dog taught that it's okay to bite people be unstable.) For a dog to think that it is acceptable to bite a human, there is something wrong. A dog that has attempted to do so multiple times, like this dog, should be euthanized as it is a danger to public safety.\n\nResources are limited. Shelters don't need to risk harm to their staff, fosters, or other animals to save one animal when the money and space could go to an animal that's already safe and adoptable. It's harsh, but that's reality. The dog *had* proper training as a puppy and had a behavioral shift with age. In this case, it was severe, but it's not unheard of. The dog has attacked other animals multiple times and has attacked to bite a child multiple times. Where is the line for you? At what point is it acceptable to say that this dog is too dangerous to be left without a muzzle or has to always be crated, and that isn't an acceptable way for a dog to live?\n\nu/Lacroix24601 was not assigning human morality of \"good\" or \"bad\" with their statements, a dog is a dog and cannot be held to human standards. Recognizing that there are limits to what you can do does not mean a dog is \"bad.\"", "I had to rehome my Aussie girl. She was so aggressive towards our other dog and we tried everything. Various trainers, us training her, spaying her, running her, taking her to the dog park to run off some energy. I loved my dog. Unfortunately, everything we did she kept. Beng aggressive towards our older dog. We tried to keep the separated and they would be okay for a few weeks. All of this ended up in her going for his throat at the dog park. His neck was bloodied, she got him and broke some of her teeth (I think they were baby teeth) thankfully I was able to pull her off before she killed him. It was super scary. We ended up rehoming her and gave them her detailed history. Absolutely no other animals or children. It was heartbreaking but it was for the best.", "Aggression. Not agression.

If the baby was hurt because of the dog, you would never forgive yourself. You didn\u2019t choose, raise or train this aggressive dog and did your best to find a solution, so I think you\u2019re NTA.

Of course, she wasn't there when the dog did the Jekyl/Hyde switch.", "How kind of you to volunteer helping this person do this!", "Your in fairy land here, thinking everything will be okay if you give the dog to a home with no children. Every dog will interact with children at some point, whether it\u2019s family visiting or being walked. Show me one shelter that isn\u2019t full. I love dogs. I love animals. But it\u2019s highly irresponsible to give a dog away that is known aggressive and has attacked children before. \n\nI work with horses. I\u2019ve seen first hand and had to handle horses with severe aggression who should never have been sold on. One was sold to a 15 year old. They were told he was only aggressive around feed time. The horse was dangerous to anything inside the stable with. Used to pin us in the corner and strike out at us (made us staff extremely nervous at lates due to being by ourselves). Many of us staff had scars due to him, one was bitten in the face (1cm away from the eye). The kid was terrified of him, ended up selling him to a dealer and now wants nothing to do with horses. This horse should have never been sold to her. The kindest thing to do, would be to euthanise him. He was most definitely abused in the past which is awful for him but he was extremely dangerous for us to handle. It\u2019s the same with dogs. Once they\u2019ve gone past the point of being trainable and worked with, and are actively attacking people, the humanist thing to do is euthanasia.", "God this is heartbreaking. i am so glad you are okay now.", "That is so terrible I am sorry!!\n\nOur vet said when animals have a sudden change like that it's often a brain tumor.
