Absolutely awful experience. Luckily (?) she was older and could scream for help and hit the dog off. A newborn or a toddler couldn\u2019t do that. If my kid had been a small child she wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nYou are so, SO NTA.\n\nETA if your partner needs convincing further hit me up and I\u2019ll send you some pictures of her injuries. She is still deeply traumatised and terrified of dogs. This dog was an Alsatian and had never bitten before, but had lunged at people. I love dogs but would never have one around a small child or a baby.", "Unfortunately, NTA. I wish there was another way. If your family has time to blame you, perhaps one of them should step up to take care of the dog instead.", "NTA. I volunteer with rescues and there are some dogs that, sadly, cannot be helped. It\u2019s not too common but Ive known rescues to make the hard choice to put the dog down so it will finally know peace. \n\nI love dogs. LOVE. Like a crazy amount, but the safety of your family HAS to come first.", "NTA. We adopted a shelter pit bull who\u2019d been abused as a pup, and he was aggressive around strangers and other animals. We thought he was just being protective of us and kept him away from people and critters. He bit two people, but we didn\u2019t want to euthanize him. It finally happened. Out of the blue one afternoon he suddenly attacked me and almost killed me. We tried to find a no-kill shelter that would take him, but nobody would take him. We understood and have to have him put down. We knew he loved us and we loved him, but I knew I couldn\u2019t be alone with him any more. If my husband hadn\u2019t pulled him off me I\u2019d be dead now. My surgeon told me it was a miracle the dog didn\u2019t kill me. It broke our hearts, but we couldn\u2019t take the risk any more.\nYou are most definitely justified in your fears. It\u2019s too much of a risk. Take my word on this. I\u2019ll send pictures of my scars if you want to use them as part of your case.\nOh, and if your home insurance company finds out you knowingly kept a dog that has a history of aggression, they will cancel your homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance. It happened to us and it was a huge mess.", "NTA.  If you rehomed her and she attacked someone else's kid, how would you feel?  If you rehomed her and she was aggressive, her new owners might physically abuse her or chain her outside to live alone in the yard.  As someone who worked in animal rescue for years, I can tell you that in certain circumstances euthanasia can be the most humane choice for the animal.", "NTA \n\nThe dog has multiple instances of attack towards other animals, and aggression towards children. You CANNOT have that dog around your child.\n\nNTA", "NTA the rest of the family is quick to judge you about it but not quick to take the dog themselves.", "\"and family\" ... none of whom is offering to take the dog?\n\nSad but NTA", "You are NTA. My son thought the same about an adopted rescue dog and it mauled him without warning. He was lucky that his damage and scarring are not worse.

I grew up with a snappy dog (never got bit but had lots of rules to abide by so she didn\u2019t bite me) and looking back I don\u2019t know why my parents allowed it. \n\nAs sad as you might be over this you have to protect your baby. Your niece did nothing to provoke the dog before being attacked, as per your previous comments, and the dog is now older and more likely to be grumpy. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with the fallout of this, but I do think it is the best idea to put your dog down", "NTA - Biting twice at your niece is one too many.", "NTA. Dog aggression typically comes from certain environments and as well as issues with the dog. Not knowing where your partners dad got the dog leaves a lot of assumptions to be made. While you can send dogs to canine behavior classes to try and curb or suppress aggressive behavior, it\u2019s still an animal that can think and act on its own. Even a well trained dog can react negatively to certain stimuli. I know this first hand. I have a working K9 that I trust with my life. However while he is very friendly with people, he is not allowed out when my wife and daughter have guest over if I\u2019m not home. They don\u2019t know how to read dog behaviors or tell if he\u2019s getting stressed like I can. \nI would not recommend rehoming because now you are taking this aggressive behavior and sending it else where and it\u2019s not a smart decision unless the dog goes to someone that knows what they are doing. It\u2019s a tough call but you are making the right decision.", "NTA and I know you're probably heartbroken over this, but you're making the right choice given your circumstances. You cannot have this dog around your baby. It's terribly terribly sad, but she can't be trusted, and someone has to be the one who's thinking reasonably about your situation. I saw your comment that everyone has shit to say but no help to give. Tell those people they can come over to your house, either to take the dog or to say their goodbyes to her.", "Nta", "NTA please show your husband these comments. I feel awful for the dog but you are taking a big risk.", "NTA. The right thing to do with an aggressive animal is to euthanize it. It is unacceptable to put your future child or anyone else that may come in contact with the dog in danger. There are too many stories of children being mauled to death by a dog to justify not euthanizing it.", "NTA! I had to do the something similar. I had my dog for 2 years and she just got aggressive more and more. The last fight I broke up, I ended up in the hospital. (Not from either dog) but she wouldn't let us go in the kids room, we weren't allowed to laugh. Or gasp. For 1 month we walked on egg shells. My husband and I finally decided the best thing was to put her down. - I couldn't dare rehome her knowing how she was turning mean with laughter, loud noises, so kids were out of the question. Then my mind went to even yo a home with no live in kids, what if kids visit. I didn't trust her to not turn on them one day.  It was what was best for her and I do not regret it. I miss her but I'm at peace knowing she's not being used as a bait dog, attacking other pets or maybe humans.", "NTA. Too many toddler and babies are permanently scarred or killed by aggressive dogs. If he's already been aggressive he doesn't need to be around babies.\n\nIf they are so worried tell them to either take the dog now or they can STFU. It's your dog, your home, your baby and your say. I'd tell the next relative who harrrassws you about it to come pick up and keep the dog themselves.", "NTA. As a former animal shelter worker, this is the sort of dog that is almost impossible to safely rehome. Even if you could find someone who will never have a child in their home, the dog has to go outside at times and what happens if it encounters a child then? And it is a clear threat to your baby so please don't listen to your partner or family members in this. Every dog attack where the dog bit a second time involved someone who was unwilling to put that dog down. In some cases, the person the dog bit died. Don't let that happen to your child.", "NTA. Sometimes behavioral euthanasia is the kindest thing we can do. There are options of basket muzzles, extensive training and medications but looking at the quality of Life and safety of other pets and people, it necessary. Hugs!!", "NTA\n\nSadly, this dog cannot be trusted. There might be a chance that training would lessen the dog's aggressiveness, but there is also a chance that training won't help. \n\nDon't risk your baby. If a shelter won't take the dog, euthanasia is the best option.", "NTA. I would love to see you surrender doggo to a shelter that can handle her, but she's got enough of a history with other animals that there probably isn't a shelter in the universe that can handle her. You've done your due diligence, and here's the thing about aggressive dogs: they're aggressive because they're *scared*. A dog that lashes out and tries to attack everything is afraid of everything, and that's no way to live. Having her put down sucks, and it would be great if somebody had the resources to rehabilitate her, but sometimes it's the most merciful thing for a really violent dog.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry there isn\u2019t an alternative solution. I would try to find a dog behavior specialist or a rescue group to take her in and rehabilitate her, but it sounds like you\u2019ve tried that. If your dad was already going to have her euthanized, I am not sure how you trying to help for as long as you could keep her makes you the asshole. You did\u2019t adopt this dog initially and you are no longer able to have her safely in your home.", "NTA- so sorry you are dealing with this. Take note that none of your relatives want to offer to step back in (bc they\u2019re aware of the poor dog\u2019s aggressive behavior). \n\nThis dog has a history of attacking an infant/toddler already, imagine the potential consequence of keeping it in the house especially as it gets older. This isn\u2019t easy, but your future infant needs to be safe and you have to be comfortable in your own home.", "NTA. Whoever feels bad about your decision should take the dog in themselves and deal with it. Otherwise you\u2019re not obligated to keep it in your home with new children. I\u2019m sure the mother who just lost her two young babies to their dog attacking them would\u2019ve done things differently as well. Trust your gut on this one.", "Here to join the chorus of NTA. There has been too many deaths and injuries of children by dogs where the owners believe it would never happen because the dogs were only aggressive to non-family members. It's not worth the risk.", "NTA. You were kind enough to take her but you can see it's an accident waiting to happen. If no one else is prepared to take her on and pay for the professional dog behaviourist she needs, they don't have a right to complain.", "NTA!!! Protect your baby!! Everyone has opinions but NONE of them have taken her!! When I had my first daughter we had two pit mixes, they were extremely loveable dogs with no history of aggression and I still worried and watched them around her as a baby because you never know how a dog will react. Thankfully they never showed any aggression towards her and ended up being extremely loving and gentle with her up until the days they passed...but that isnt always the case, you just NEVER know!! You're honestly making the most humane choice for the dog, especially since she has showed signs of aggression and has nipped your niece already.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can keep the dog away from a child, make it an outdoor pen with a warm house, or a section of the house that the dog is in and the child not.  We are everything to these animals, and when they are not raised properly, we kill them instead of helping them or taking extra time.  It's depressing.", "NTA.

I know how to read my dog and can tell when he\u2019s stressed or getting mentally elevated, my wife and daughter do not. It\u2019s a safety thing. If my dog bites you it won\u2019t be a nip, it won\u2019t be a quick bite and let go, he\u2019s going to bite you and hold on until he\u2019s given to command to release.", "What kind of dog is it?

Many times the aggression is born from something - usually fear or anxiety.\n\nThis is not a good quality of life for them because the only response they have in uncomfortable situations is to bite and that doesn\u2019t make them happy. Most dogs don\u2019t want to bite, but they have no other outlet\u2026 so they use what they have, and while yes dogs generally show signs, they can progress from uncomfortable body language to a snap in an instant (I\u2019ve had that misfortune personally).\n\nA new child is a huge change. You won\u2019t be able to give the pup the attention she had prior, and that will cause her stress. Her behavior is likely to worsen if anything. Her quality of life will go down as her anxiety/fear in such a situation goes up.\n\nBehavioral euthanasia is never fun, but with a bite history with a child, I\u2019d agree fully. I give some leeway with provoked snaps (pulled dogs tail or ear - then maybe would do fine in a home without kids), but generally, I trust an owner when they come to a decision like this with said history.\n\nI euthanized an 8 month dog once for aggression.

Which to me meant she'd growl at them or would run away. \n\nA few months passed without incident and then summer came and kids would be outside at the park when she was. The dog LUNGED at these kids. We had to wrestle the dog to the ground as the kids ran and she was on a leash! We couldn't have house guests with kids couldn't go any where there might be kids. Because we were so limited on where we could go and what we could do she got more and more aggressive. She started to hate me and growl at me and snapped at me several times. My husband at the time was adamant we couldn't just abandon her. Even when our neighbor stopped by and she bit his arm and clamped down. Luckily he was wearing his military uniform and she only got his sleeve but we had to choke her and drag her to the other room. But husband was convinced only garbage people get rid of their pets as many people are. Even when I brought it up to friends and family who were all terrified of the dog they would act shocked that I wanted to grt rid of it. \n\nFinally he got orders and we had to move across country. The idea of driving across the country with a dog that literally couldn't be let outside when a kid was in its eyesight and would absolutly attack someone if they approached her wrong was terrifying. A huge liability and I was honestly scared she would get upset and attack us in the car. We didn't know how we would even get her in a crate. I told him I would fly home to my family and he could go live on the other side of the country with his dog because I wasn't going to live a life revolving around that dog. He agreed and we took her to a rescue that agreed she would not be adopted out to anyone. She just wasn't compatible with modern life. She stayed at the rescue with only adults for the rest of her life sadly and I sometimes wonder if it would have been kinder to just euthanize even with how nice the rescue was. \n\nSome dogs just cannot be helped.

In reality, this is just... not possible in the vast majority of cases. Very few people are actually equipped to take on a dog like this and the responsibilities that come with it's stewardship, and they are few and far between. Rescues and shelters are already running over capacity. They want to make sure the animals they take in are animals they can easily find homes for, not ones that require serious behavioural modification training and run the risk of taking up space for long periods of time that could have gone to countless others. It is an unfortunate reality that people simply do not like to face.\n\nI have no idea the circumstances around which this aggression originated - maybe this is aggression due to fear, due to improper socialization as a pup, or due to breed-specific behaviours exacerbated by its environment. Sometimes, you can indeed address the cause and fix this behaviour, but some dogs just can't be helped. I am presuming that when you took her in, you also did your best to address this aggression through training and mitigation. You seem to be very aware that this also is absolutely a lifelong process in which you must be constantly vigilant knowing that a dog like this will never be 100% safe. You cannot have a dog like this around children.\n\nI think you already know in your heart that it is time to say goodbye.\n\nSometimes, as in this case, it means putting an animal to sleep, giving it the final mercy of peace. Better this way, in your arms and surrounded by your love, than the alternatives - being frightened and alone in an animal control facility after a serious attack on a human being, or, god forbid, being shot by a cop responding to a 911 call about a dog attack.

I came over frequently enough to see him, but most others didn't even know they had a dog. My cousins' friends weren't allowed in the garage or backyard. I was the fourth kid the dog had attacked, but the first unprovoked attack on someone the dog was familiar with. My uncle put it down the next day but my cousins blamed me for it.\n\nAs an adult, I had to boycott my parents' home because their 2yo dog had bitten five people, all women and children, and two of the women ended up in the hospital. I was being \"mean and thoughtless\" because I refused to go into their home or bring my kids over, even if they put the dog outside, until it was rehomed or euthanized. They got this dog as a puppy and it was never abused; if anything, it was pampered. They even did a whole year of training. I'm pretty sure it was just an inbred, psychotic dog of an already aggressive breed. They could not find one rescue or shelter that would even begin to consider taking the dog after hearing the bite history. Had to be euthanized. My parents almost separated over it.\n\nHow no one in my family ever got sued is a mystery to me.

Your family's safety comes first, certainly, but perhaps trained professionals at a shelter can help him.", "Hmm, NTA. \n\nThis is a sad situation. I don't think a dog who has bitten should automatically be euthanised. It's akin to saying a person who has been in a fight should be put down. There are different levels of bites, and if a dog has \"nipped/tried to bite\" that's very low level. If a dog intends to cause damage, it will usually succeed. These incidents sound like warnings.\n\nMany dogs dislike being around children and/or other animals. When pushed into those situations, it can lead to bites. \"Gentle\" children can still be incredibly difficult/impossible for some dogs to tolerate. \n\nThat said, this dog clearly isn't going to be happy in your home with a baby. Meaning it won't be safe, I agree. If you have genuinely exhausted all avenues, then euthanasia might be the only option. BUT if you've only contacted a couple of places and just assumed that nowhere will take the dog, then soft YTA. Personally I would be contacting every single place you can find with a copy and pasted message explaining the situation and time limit. \n\nI'm sorry you've ended up in this situation though, and family members who are criticising should be offering help with trying to find somewhere suitable if they feel so passionately.", "NTA I\u2019ve been there.

You should work with a rescue to find an adult home or home with someone with teenagers.\n\nIf a dog and a child don't get along you don't \"try it again\". \n\nI grew up with a dog that just was nervous around babies and so whenever there was a baby around, I would baby get the dog in another room, or crate the dog so the dog wouldn't be stressed out. The worst thing that ever happened was the dog tried to bite the back of the diapers of toddlers running around and that was it. I didn't let the dog around tiny children. It was a very gentle dog that never bit anyone or did anything wrong but I wasn't going to take a chance.\n\nSome dogs just are startled by the quick movements of little people or for whatever reason. You think the child is gentle but lots of little children go toward the dog even being gentle with their hand over the dog's head and a lot of dogs don't like that.\n\nSometimes we ignore a dog's body language, the dog licking their lips, looking away either by moving their whole head away or using avoidant body language or seeing the whites of their eyes a lot. It is a sign they are nervous and most people don't pick up on that and come to their dog's rescue\n\nNow there are dogs that are nervous around kids but when they have their own baby so to speak they are very protective.  But if you don't want to chance it, there are probably plenty of homes where a younger couple is not going to have children before the dog dies of old age, someone that doesn't have kids where this could be a perfectly fine dog for\n\n\nThere's a lot of rescues that have a lot of wonderful dogs that are there because they nipped a small child.

Then she attacked our older dog again, this time going for her throat. We'd pulled her off quickly, but our coyote mix needed staples on her neck. We had a dog trainer evaluate her and told us her best bet was to be rehomed to a place without any other dogs. But most people who want dogs already have at least one, so that wasn't working out.\n\nThen she tried to go after the puppy she adopted. She was trying to resource guard some food and snarled at him. I was close enough to grab her collar as he approached her trying to see if she was okay, then she lunged at him. I was holding tight so she couldn't hurt him, but it shook me how far gone she was. We made the call to put her to sleep. It was one of the hardest things I've had to do, but I had to weigh everyone's safety against her life and I couldn't justify anything else.", "I have been there with my beloved dog as well.  He just turned.  Something went black in his eyes and he dragged me around and broke my hand amd tore it up quite badley.  He too was abused and we had 5 year old at the time.  I knew surrendering him to be put with another family would further traumatize him so we out him down.  It was gutting but ultimately the correct decision to make. \n\nOP NTA\n\nI am sorry you are here but this is the kindest thing to do for your dog given the circumstance", "2 too many", "Oh my god I\u2019m so sorry they had to go through that poor babies.", "Yes", "I\u2019m multiple states away from Utah sadly", "The dog has been through training. It never helped.", "How is it better to have a dog live outside all the time while two new parents deal with their newborn baby than to either euthanize or rehome? The dog has showed multiple times it cannot be around kids. Would you like it to kill a child before saying enough?", "Also, if you haven\u2019t, maybe you could post about her and your situation on social media like fb, tiktok or insta, stating you are trying your very best to find her a loving home with people that are willing to take and understand her behaviour. Maybe we could help you out by sharing it, so it could get more traction and a better chance in finding someone suitable? Again, just a suggestion. I do know that if you\u2019re posting this on reddit there\u2019s a chance you don\u2019t want to expose yourself, which is totally fine.", "OP says this dog has been in training since she was young. The dog behaves well unless she\u2019s off leash outside. She gets extremely unpredictable and you can\u2019t trust her around children. \n\nWhat more can she do?", "Op says she\u2019s tried to find shelters to no avail. Shelters are absolutely overwhelmed right now and will refuse surrenders", "The second time she showed aggression to my niece was with me. She has never had access to her since and won\u2019t ever. Even with major training and as much as I love my dog I don\u2019t think I will ever feel safe having a baby around the dog, because as other people have said even if the first times she didn\u2019t severely hurt my niece those are the warnings and I don\u2019t want the one time I turn my back be the time something very bad happens", "My dad got her as a puppy", "BECAUSE THEYRE FULL. shelters actively turn away surrenders when they are overwhelmed", "And keep saying this.  \"I have an infant arriving shortly and cannot keep the dog. Who will take the dog\".  And for every comment you get, send a text/fb, \"are you going to take the dog, when can I drop him off\"? \n\nIf they're going to be public with their comments, you be public too.  This is your child's safety.", "You are NTA. You are also not obligated to tell family what you chose to do. You can offer the dog to them (which none of them will take it). Then don't tell them what you chose. You can say you found a rescue. You found a trainer, whatever. But you should not have to hear them be judging of you. Your child's safety is more important than anything. Sorry you are dealing with this.", "I am a vet who euthanizes dogs for aggression without a second thought. All the people I've met who say that these dogs should find this magical, kid-free, safe home with an experienced professional NEVER step up and actually take on any of these dogs. Many have severely attacked people without provocation. Our shelters euthanize plenty of lovely dogs who need homes and don't kill or maim people or other animals. We don't need to keep the dangerous/pathologically terrified ones around.", "Why can't you consider having a rescue help you adopt the dog out to an adult home? If they are fine with the adults and the family and it's only a baby or small toddler that they have nipped, a lot of there's a lot of dogs out there that just don't tolerate small children.  Someone that does not have small children may find the dog is a wonderful companion for them.\n\nUnless it's a great dane, 6 years is simply an adult dog. The dog is not elderly they could live another  4 to 10 years or even up to 18, 19 if they a tiny dog. \n\nThe dog isn't at an age where it would be impossible for a rescue to find a home", "> *I took in my dads dog because he was previously going to have to get her put down for repeatedly attacking neighbors animals* \n\nIs what OP said.  It doesn't sound like it's just confused by kids.", "I agree. This dog could thrive in a home with no other animals or children, with people who are experienced dog handlers. They would have to get this dog evaluated by a professional.", "I\u2019m so sorry. That sounds terrifying.", "There's a lot of wonderful dogs that don't get along with small children. They shouldn't die because of it. Having a rescue help you find an adult home is way better than death and the dog could be quite happy with them\n\n The sudden movements of a toddler can be confusing and because the toddler is tiny and on their level they may not know what to make it of it especially if the dog is smaller than the toddler.  The dog may have never been socialized with babies which they feel are foreign to them.\n\nDogs do not like people to go to pet them with their hand over their head. A lot of small kids try to do that and it's actually quite an aggressive body language towards the dog if that's not the dog's person. \n\nSo please, if the dog is perfectly lovely towards you and kind adult members of your family (not people that on purpose try to stare the dog down, tried to aggravate the dog), baby gave the dog away when small children are coming over in the meantime until you find a proper adult home.\n\nThe dog could also be perfectly fine with \"their\" baby but if you don't want to take the risk, work with a rescue to properly screen homes. Chihuahua, Dachshund and herding dog rescues are full of dogs that have nipped  a small child and they go on to lead long lives of happy companionship with people that don't have small children. \n\nSometimes we don't recognize a dog's body language, licking lips, seeing the whites of their eyes, leaning away which are signs there uncomfortable around a little person and we think a nip comes out of nowhere.", "Gosh, I\u2019m so sorry you went through that. With our dog, it was like he had a psychotic break. After I was loaded into the ambulance and taken to the hospital, he reverted back to his typical self and was trying to find me.", "I'm honestly amazed at how resilient they are. They still are unafraid of my dog and their own pet dog, so they're not afraid of all dogs for life which is amazing in itself. They are wary of strange dogs now especially in the neighborhood or park setting. They're healing really well. I just know how horrible their mom felt and how helpless she felt in that moment, and the ptsd she has walking around the neighborhood now or just playing in the front yard and can't imagine how awful it feels, and it would probably feel even worse if you knew the dog was capable and kept it and something happened, and I don't wish that on you or anyone else.", "Thank you and wishing you nothing but the best of luck with the dog and you delivery", "While this is very sad, you are NTA for doing what you have to do.  I'm just gonna go cry a little now.", "It's a really hard choice. I completely see your side of it. Hope there is a last minute reprieve for the dog with someone or a group.", "We had an elderly dog when I was very small. I was his favorite person, but my mom left us in the dining room to grab something in the kitchen and she heard a growl, a snap, then me crying. He bit my face, and I still have a slight dent in my cheek 30 years later. It's a tough decision when to let them go, but my mom made the same choice. It was his first aggressive act, but she wasn't willing to risk another.\n\nI hope you can keep trying in the meantime to find her an appropriate home or shelter, but I don't fault you for having to make such a difficult choice if nothing comes available by the euthanasia date.", "I appreciate what you are saying but I currently, not used to, work in rescue and foster and everyone is out of room, from the shelters to the rescues.  Do tell us where these places are that are not also overflowing.", "I would love to find her a home or have a rescue help, can you recommend one that isn\u2019t full or completely struggling to find fosters and homes for the dogs they already have that don\u2019t have aggressive histories?", "Some dogs have prey drives..there are different hunting dogs that can't be trusted around chickens and bunnies for example.", "I would love to find her a home or have a rescue help, can you recommend one that isn\u2019t full or completely struggling to find fosters and homes for the dogs they already have that don\u2019t have aggressive histories?", "He probably did it because you unknowingly did something that triggered his fight-or-flight response. Perhaps he didn't know you were home, or you walked too near to him too quickly, or something like that. Or maybe someone/something else had him feeling overstimulated/anxious and he lashed out. He likely had PTSD from his prior abuse, which means it could've had nothing to do with you particularly and everything to do with trauma/panic responses. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not making excuses for the dog or pinning any blame on you. It was *not* your fault. Based on your comments you did everything you possibly could to help and re-train him. But nobody can explain PTSD or psychological coping methods to a dog, who is simply incapable of understanding such things. I'm just trying to provide potential answers for the question of \"why did he do it\".", "If, after tens of thousands of years of domestication, we still couldn't trust dogs not to try to kill us unless we specifically raised each and every one not to kill family members, we'd have given it up as a bad job thousands of years ago, let them return to the wild, and there would be no such thing as pet dogs.  \nIt's a breed thing.  Fighting breed dogs weren't created as pets.", "And it's recognized that some dogs have prey drives, so the go-to isn't to have the dog euthanized.  The fact that her dad was going to *have* to euthanize this dog indicates there's more going on than, \"Oh--it's just prey drive.\"    \n\n\nI'm sure OP would be happy to let you adopt this dog.  Risk your own kids.", "It could have been a dominance issue, maybe food insecurity, we\u2019ll just never know.

But your hubby is delusional at this point. After repeated occurrences of the dog biting young children and small animals, he's being dismissive about this happening again. Be strong, and hopefully he'll come around. If not, then you're 100% making the right decision.", "Hopefully they would, but people lie and omit information, thinking they are being kind and giving the dog a chance. The dog could end up in a position to cause serious harm.", "While that is true, he'd first have to sue for custody. At which point, during the hearing, it is very much not going to be in his favour if he has an aggressive dog with a history of snapping at children in his home.", "If it does come to that you will need to explore going to court to keep him to taking the baby near the dog", "Oh I agree, I was thinking more during certain times of the day to minimize negative interactions with the baby. It's just a really unfortunate situation altogether, so I don't feel OP is the AH"]}
