Absolutely awful experience. Luckily (?) she was older and could scream for help and hit the dog off. A newborn or a toddler couldn\u2019t do that. If my kid had been a small child she wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nYou are so, SO NTA.\n\nETA if your partner needs convincing further hit me up and I\u2019ll send you some pictures of her injuries. She is still deeply traumatised and terrified of dogs. This dog was an Alsatian and had never bitten before, but had lunged at people. I love dogs but would never have one around a small child or a baby.", "Unfortunately, NTA. I wish there was another way. If your family has time to blame you, perhaps one of them should step up to take care of the dog instead.", "NTA. I volunteer with rescues and there are some dogs that, sadly, cannot be helped. It\u2019s not too common but Ive known rescues to make the hard choice to put the dog down so it will finally know peace. \n\nI love dogs. LOVE. Like a crazy amount, but the safety of your family HAS to come first.", "NTA. We adopted a shelter pit bull who\u2019d been abused as a pup, and he was aggressive around strangers and other animals. We thought he was just being protective of us and kept him away from people and critters. He bit two people, but we didn\u2019t want to euthanize him. It finally happened. Out of the blue one afternoon he suddenly attacked me and almost killed me. We tried to find a no-kill shelter that would take him, but nobody would take him. We understood and have to have him put down. We knew he loved us and we loved him, but I knew I couldn\u2019t be alone with him any more. If my husband hadn\u2019t pulled him off me I\u2019d be dead now. My surgeon told me it was a miracle the dog didn\u2019t kill me. It broke our hearts, but we couldn\u2019t take the risk any more.\nYou are most definitely justified in your fears. It\u2019s too much of a risk. Take my word on this. I\u2019ll send pictures of my scars if you want to use them as part of your case.\nOh, and if your home insurance company finds out you knowingly kept a dog that has a history of aggression, they will cancel your homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance. It happened to us and it was a huge mess.", "NTA.  If you rehomed her and she attacked someone else's kid, how would you feel?  If you rehomed her and she was aggressive, her new owners might physically abuse her or chain her outside to live alone in the yard.  As someone who worked in animal rescue for years, I can tell you that in certain circumstances euthanasia can be the most humane choice for the animal.", "NTA \n\nThe dog has multiple instances of attack towards other animals, and aggression towards children. You CANNOT have that dog around your child.\n\nNTA", "NTA the rest of the family is quick to judge you about it but not quick to take the dog themselves.", "\"and family\" ... none of whom is offering to take the dog?\n\nSad but NTA", "You are NTA. My son thought the same about an adopted rescue dog and it mauled him without warning. He was lucky that his damage and scarring are not worse.

I grew up with a snappy dog (never got bit but had lots of rules to abide by so she didn\u2019t bite me) and looking back I don\u2019t know why my parents allowed it. \n\nAs sad as you might be over this you have to protect your baby. Your niece did nothing to provoke the dog before being attacked, as per your previous comments, and the dog is now older and more likely to be grumpy. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with the fallout of this, but I do think it is the best idea to put your dog down", "NTA - Biting twice at your niece is one too many.", "NTA. Dog aggression typically comes from certain environments and as well as issues with the dog. Not knowing where your partners dad got the dog leaves a lot of assumptions to be made. While you can send dogs to canine behavior classes to try and curb or suppress aggressive behavior, it\u2019s still an animal that can think and act on its own. Even a well trained dog can react negatively to certain stimuli. I know this first hand. I have a working K9 that I trust with my life. However while he is very friendly with people, he is not allowed out when my wife and daughter have guest over if I\u2019m not home. They don\u2019t know how to read dog behaviors or tell if he\u2019s getting stressed like I can. \nI would not recommend rehoming because now you are taking this aggressive behavior and sending it else where and it\u2019s not a smart decision unless the dog goes to someone that knows what they are doing. It\u2019s a tough call but you are making the right decision.", "NTA and I know you're probably heartbroken over this, but you're making the right choice given your circumstances. You cannot have this dog around your baby. It's terribly terribly sad, but she can't be trusted, and someone has to be the one who's thinking reasonably about your situation. I saw your comment that everyone has shit to say but no help to give. Tell those people they can come over to your house, either to take the dog or to say their goodbyes to her.", "Nta", "NTA please show your husband these comments. I feel awful for the dog but you are taking a big risk.", "NTA. The right thing to do with an aggressive animal is to euthanize it. It is unacceptable to put your future child or anyone else that may come in contact with the dog in danger. There are too many stories of children being mauled to death by a dog to justify not euthanizing it.", "NTA! I had to do the something similar. I had my dog for 2 years and she just got aggressive more and more. The last fight I broke up, I ended up in the hospital. (Not from either dog) but she wouldn't let us go in the kids room, we weren't allowed to laugh. Or gasp. For 1 month we walked on egg shells. My husband and I finally decided the best thing was to put her down. - I couldn't dare rehome her knowing how she was turning mean with laughter, loud noises, so kids were out of the question. Then my mind went to even yo a home with no live in kids, what if kids visit. I didn't trust her to not turn on them one day.  It was what was best for her and I do not regret it. I miss her but I'm at peace knowing she's not being used as a bait dog, attacking other pets or maybe humans.", "NTA. Too many toddler and babies are permanently scarred or killed by aggressive dogs. If he's already been aggressive he doesn't need to be around babies.\n\nIf they are so worried tell them to either take the dog now or they can STFU. It's your dog, your home, your baby and your say. I'd tell the next relative who harrrassws you about it to come pick up and keep the dog themselves.", "NTA. As a former animal shelter worker, this is the sort of dog that is almost impossible to safely rehome. Even if you could find someone who will never have a child in their home, the dog has to go outside at times and what happens if it encounters a child then? And it is a clear threat to your baby so please don't listen to your partner or family members in this. Every dog attack where the dog bit a second time involved someone who was unwilling to put that dog down. In some cases, the person the dog bit died. Don't let that happen to your child.", "NTA. Sometimes behavioral euthanasia is the kindest thing we can do. There are options of basket muzzles, extensive training and medications but looking at the quality of Life and safety of other pets and people, it necessary. Hugs!!", "NTA\n\nSadly, this dog cannot be trusted. There might be a chance that training would lessen the dog's aggressiveness, but there is also a chance that training won't help. \n\nDon't risk your baby. If a shelter won't take the dog, euthanasia is the best option.", "NTA. I would love to see you surrender doggo to a shelter that can handle her, but she's got enough of a history with other animals that there probably isn't a shelter in the universe that can handle her. You've done your due diligence, and here's the thing about aggressive dogs: they're aggressive because they're *scared*. A dog that lashes out and tries to attack everything is afraid of everything, and that's no way to live. Having her put down sucks, and it would be great if somebody had the resources to rehabilitate her, but sometimes it's the most merciful thing for a really violent dog.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry there isn\u2019t an alternative solution. I would try to find a dog behavior specialist or a rescue group to take her in and rehabilitate her, but it sounds like you\u2019ve tried that. If your dad was already going to have her euthanized, I am not sure how you trying to help for as long as you could keep her makes you the asshole. You did\u2019t adopt this dog initially and you are no longer able to have her safely in your home.", "NTA- so sorry you are dealing with this. Take note that none of your relatives want to offer to step back in (bc they\u2019re aware of the poor dog\u2019s aggressive behavior). \n\nThis dog has a history of attacking an infant/toddler already, imagine the potential consequence of keeping it in the house especially as it gets older. This isn\u2019t easy, but your future infant needs to be safe and you have to be comfortable in your own home.", "NTA. Whoever feels bad about your decision should take the dog in themselves and deal with it. Otherwise you\u2019re not obligated to keep it in your home with new children. I\u2019m sure the mother who just lost her two young babies to their dog attacking them would\u2019ve done things differently as well. Trust your gut on this one.", "Here to join the chorus of NTA. There has been too many deaths and injuries of children by dogs where the owners believe it would never happen because the dogs were only aggressive to non-family members. It's not worth the risk.", "NTA. You were kind enough to take her but you can see it's an accident waiting to happen. If no one else is prepared to take her on and pay for the professional dog behaviourist she needs, they don't have a right to complain.", "NTA!!! Protect your baby!! Everyone has opinions but NONE of them have taken her!! When I had my first daughter we had two pit mixes, they were extremely loveable dogs with no history of aggression and I still worried and watched them around her as a baby because you never know how a dog will react. Thankfully they never showed any aggression towards her and ended up being extremely loving and gentle with her up until the days they passed...but that isnt always the case, you just NEVER know!! You're honestly making the most humane choice for the dog, especially since she has showed signs of aggression and has nipped your niece already.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can keep the dog away from a child, make it an outdoor pen with a warm house, or a section of the house that the dog is in and the child not.  We are everything to these animals, and when they are not raised properly, we kill them instead of helping them or taking extra time.  It's depressing.", "NTA.

I know how to read my dog and can tell when he\u2019s stressed or getting mentally elevated, my wife and daughter do not. It\u2019s a safety thing. If my dog bites you it won\u2019t be a nip, it won\u2019t be a quick bite and let go, he\u2019s going to bite you and hold on until he\u2019s given to command to release.", "What kind of dog is it?

Many times the aggression is born from something - usually fear or anxiety.\n\nThis is not a good quality of life for them because the only response they have in uncomfortable situations is to bite and that doesn\u2019t make them happy. Most dogs don\u2019t want to bite, but they have no other outlet\u2026 so they use what they have, and while yes dogs generally show signs, they can progress from uncomfortable body language to a snap in an instant (I\u2019ve had that misfortune personally).\n\nA new child is a huge change. You won\u2019t be able to give the pup the attention she had prior, and that will cause her stress. Her behavior is likely to worsen if anything. Her quality of life will go down as her anxiety/fear in such a situation goes up.\n\nBehavioral euthanasia is never fun, but with a bite history with a child, I\u2019d agree fully. I give some leeway with provoked snaps (pulled dogs tail or ear - then maybe would do fine in a home without kids), but generally, I trust an owner when they come to a decision like this with said history.\n\nI euthanized an 8 month dog once for aggression.

Maybe that\u2019s just part of my PTSD, but it\u2019s a \u201chealthy fear.\u201d", "Ive let him know if he decides he would like to keep the dog the baby and I will live elsewhere and she won\u2019t be coming to his home. he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m serious but my babies safety is my number one priority.", "A dog being aggressive can at times only be attached to training. Golden retrievers and other dogs who are seen as family dogs without the proper training have killed children this includes those of them that are purebred.", "So then what, the dog spends the bulk of it's life in a crate? How is that any sort of life for a dog?", "There is no further life for this dog. No one will take in a dog that has attacked children twice for no reason. If the poster had not taken it in, the dog would have already been put down. Not all animals are ones that should be left to suffer as it will not find a home. For the most part any shelter it goes to will quietly put it down as it is simply a dangerous animal. Honestly for a dog this aggressive it lived a long life.", "Legally, you may not have the choice to keep the baby out of its father\u2019s house.", "Crate training", "I second all of this^\n\nA well-thought-out and beautifully said answer.\n\nOP, NTA", "Yes I know hoping it won\u2019t come to that", "That doesn't answer my question.  Does the dog then live the bulk of its life in a crate? Mine are crate trained, but rarely go into crates because that's not a way for dogs to live."]}
