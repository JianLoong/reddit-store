It was left to me by my mother after she passed away 10 years ago.  About 4 years ago, a couple about my age moved in next door and we've pretty much been at odds since day one.  There have been numerous times and issues that we've disagreed on.\n\nI have 3 cats that I sometimes let out into my backyard.  My neighbors have a dog that would jump the 5-foot chain link fence separating our yards to chase my cats.  I told my neighbors if I caught their dog doing it again, I would call the cops.  They actually had the audacity to ask if I would be willing to split the cost of a taller privacy fence instead of, you know, training your dog not to jump the fence.  Obviously, I refused as I wasn't the one causing the problem and the fence is technically on their property anyway.  They ended up putting in a taller fence.  \n\nThen, they asked me to split the cost of taking down an Ash tree that was on their property.  It had become infested with some bug that killed the tree and dead limbs were falling on their driveway.  They had the city come out and the survey guy said the tree was actually about 10% on my property.  I told them the tree was theirs and if they want it down, they'll have to pay for it because I don't have a problem with it.  \n\nNeedless to say, we're not friends.  They've also thrown some loud, late-night parties that included bonfires and loud music that I had to call the cops for as well.  \n\nI am currently out of town visiting family for a couple weeks.

I have medication for my cats that are delivered regularly.  \n\nI got a notification the other day that some packages were delivered, so I texted my friend to let them know.  But before my friend could get there, I got a notification from my Ring doorbell.   I pulled up the live feed and saw my neighbor on my patio.  I asked him what he was doing and he said a package of theirs got delivered to my house by mistake so he was just grabbing it.  \n\nI told him to leave and that my friend would bring over his package when she comes over.  He said he's not waiting for that and tried to leave.  I told him if he takes a package from my porch I'm calling the cops.  He shoved the package in front of the camera and said \"That's my name and address, OP.  I'm taking my package.\"  Then he walked away.  So, I called the police and told them that he stole a package from me and I have video proof.  They said they would investigate.  \n\nWhen my friend got there a little later, the police were talking to my neighbors.  The police must have left while she was checking on my cats, because when she went to leave it was just my neighbors outside.  \n\nThe husband yelled at her to tell me that I'm a huge asshole and that I need to take the police off speed-dial and let them deal with more important sh!t instead of using them as my own personal problem-solving service.", "created_utc": 1683662946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d4hsv/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_neighbor_after/", "score": 2982, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the ball goes over the fence though, they cannot climb the fence to retrieve the ball.

Or when is your party gonna be over?\n\nBut talk, compromise. Work together. Then if they are TA you can call the police.\n\nThen OP, you know how you got a package notification. Maybe they did too. And they opened their door and nada. Then they looked at your porch and saw a package tree-killer dot com, and went, that's probably mine. They walked over and it was.\n\nAgain, no attempts to be civil on your part. They have their package in their hands, and you want them to wait for a stranger to arrive and give it to them. You could ask, hey I can't see the label, hold it still. And you and them know you have them on video. But you go ahead and still call the police. \n\nThis low priority call is done and resolved before your friend makes it over. At least by me that's 3-4 hours before an officer shows up for that. So again YTA.\n\nYour family didn't teach you to be a good neighbor in your childhood home.\n\nAnd also, you are probably going to become the neighbor who cries wolf to the police.

Humans bringing in and facilitating a far larger cat population than the ecosystem can handle has caused some serious problems with conservation efforts.", "A higher fence does benefit both people. For one, if you think a 5' fence is stopping a cat from getting out, you're wrong. Secondly, they were talking a privacy fence. If you value privacy, that's huge.

At that point OP then threatens to call the police and lie saying they're stealing when OP knows it's the neighbors. \n\nEven ignoring what an awful neighbor OP is, you realize the police might have actual important things to deal with, right? Someone might have a real crime or be in danger?", "There's some weird \"I drink your milkshake\" logic going on with this tree thing, if anything of a neighbors starts creeping onto your property then your neighbor should be the one dealing with it.

I'm only sort of know my closest neighbours, but I always say hi, and make sure that I'm friendly with them, because... well, why not, but also because bad neighbours can make your life all sorts of hell. \n\nTechnically, the neighbours might have grounds to label this call to the cops a nuisance call - OP has video evidence, but that evidence shows that she knew for 100% sure that the package wasn't hers and that the neighbour wasn't stealing anything (I have no idea if it's actually a nuisance call, but it sure seems it - like if OP had called the cops because somebody came into their front yard to collect their frisbee). It's also easy for the neighbour to suggest that they didn't believe she would bring the package over, because she's been so combative.

With parties (especially the first one) you could have asked them to lower the noise. Also, I like to think \u201clive and let live\u201d with these kind of things. When one of my neighbours have a party I do not complain. Unless it becomes a weekly thing or I really have to get up early. I have upstairs neighbours who I hear gaming once in a while. Even at night. But I don\u2019t complain because I have a baby (who is not crying a lot but still a baby so still crying sometimes). So we let eachother be.", "Who needs to be told their loud late night parties are disturbing the neighbours, though?\n\nShe\u2019s unreasonable for the package but everything else is on them", "I\u2019d go with ESH- neighbors couldn\u2019t deal with their dogs, OP letting cats out know as much. Calling police on a party without attempts at deescalating,  package was theirs. Tree, if the majority (90%) was on their property then it\u2019s their problem. You all need to grow up and figure out how to communicate and be better neighbors! You all are arses imo. I\u2019m probably wrong but this is my opinion. Edit to ask- how in the fudge do any of y\u2019all own a house when so many can\u2019t? Inherited or not?", "I dunno, I wouldn't go to a noisy raucous party to ask them to keep it down, by myself. That's just inviting possible harm. I've called the cops on neighbours for this before. They don't get charged they get asked to wrap it up.", "> Calling the police about the parties without talking to them about it first is very asshole.\n\nTrying to tell a bunch of drunk arseholes that their fun is too loud and reasoning with them is not a good idea. They already *know* they're disturbing people. They already don't care. Have a loud party, disturb your neighbours, you can expect a call from the cops.", "Im sorry did I miss the part where they were absolutely awful? What terrible thing did they do ???", "He might have got a notification with a picture of where the package was located. And if it wasnt his you know they would have been in trouble or she would\u2019ve atleast mentioned it at the end by now. This is the type of neighbor I would HATE to have", "I\u2019m a 27 year old single woman that has 3 dogs, but I absolutely love that people assume I\u2019m pathetic and miserable. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m quite happy this way. While OP is an AH, I don\u2019t think we should judge her based on marital status and having more than 1 pet.", "Same. I wanted to ask how \"late\" these ragers were. 10 pm? On a weekend? *Gasp* they sound like they're in a neighborhood so I highly doubt it's a college style kegger going till 4 am like she makes out. OP sounds miserable in their life and likes to take it out on the neighbors cause she can. \n\nOP YTA", "Seriously. The people who just let their cats out unattended can get absolutely fucked. Domesticated cats do so much damage to the local wildlife populations. It's not all owned domesticated cats, but still.\n\n> We estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.3\u20134.0 billion birds and 6.3\u201322.3 billion mammals annually. Un-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality. Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals.\n\nThey estimate roughly 20% of those deaths are caused by pet cats.", "Sadly a fence will not keep the cats in and they would keep going into the yard with the dog to torment it. Cats don't GAF lol. Where I live there are so many strays, I don't understand why people are comfortable letting their cats out to torment birds and other wildlife and also to potentially get hit by a car.", "Have your cats ever gone into their yard?\n\nGiven your behaviour, you're lucky they're more pleasant people than you, they probably would've trapped them otherwise.", "I guarantee the cops know who OP is and groan when they hear her address.", "Haha she's probably embarrassed by her stupid sounding hat.", "How were they a jerk about the fence", "Not necessarily. \u201cpersons entering onto another person\u2019s land must have a legitimate reason for doing so or risk being held civilly, or perhaps even criminally, liable for trespass\u201d. Pretty sure withholding your property for no reason, while all someone does is retrieve it, is a valid reason. \n\nDepending on the delivery service OP could be breaking the law for withholding someone\u2019s mail, not just theft.", "Different than what?", "Brit here - if I was picking up a package, I'd walk over to their door and knock on to say what I was doing, but if they're not answering and my parcel is right there, I'm taking it. I'd expect them to do the same.\n\nWalking up to someone's door and ringing the bell is not trespassing. If you're asked to leave, you should obviously do so immediately, and you shouldn't walk over their garden or anything - but walking up a path to knock on the door of your next door neighbour is totally normal behaviour. In the UK, police would tell you to stop wasting their time if you reported a neighbour for picking up their own package from your porch, idk what American police would say though.\n\nThe whole shituation is toxic, which is why OP escalated immediately.", "yes we have a lot of package thieves here where I live (in the US). If I knew my package went to the wrong place, I would go to ask for it. If it was still sitting on their steps, I would probably knock or ring the bell just to let them know I was taking the package. But if they weren't home I would just take it and go. Because it's mine. The neighbors sound like assholes in general but the guy showed OP on the camera that it was his package so not wanting him to take it was absurd. Calling the cops for that was totally shitty.", "people in general shouldn\u2019t be letting their cats out because they\u2019re an invasive species and the cats will likely get ripped apart by some other animal if not the neighbor\u2019s dog. yeah, the dog shouldn\u2019t be chasing anything into her yard, but if you let your cat out and it gets into shit it would be inevitable even if the house next door was vacant", "Actually a cat will win in a fight with a dog as cats have very sharp claws or at least scratch the crap out of that dog. Also cats are predators by nature as well.", "Shooting a dog attacking your pets is leagues away from shooting people who knocked on the wrong door or turned in the wrong driveway.  I wasn\u2019t supporting the idea of shooting dogs in the first place, just arguing that OP\u2019s response was not extreme.", "i agree with you except about the fence. there already was a fence and it was sufficient until people with dog moved in and the dog required a taller fence. IMO that isn't OP's problem. If you own a dog it's your responsibility to make sure your dog doesn't escape from your yard. \n\nBut OP should've paid 10% for the tree removal, since it is 10% on her property and it is infested and dying. And the situation with the package is completely assholeish, why call the cops if you can literally see that they're taking their own package from your front steps? I don't understand what her complaint even was. \"hello police my neighbor is stealing their own amazon package from my porch, go stop them!\" I mean, really?\n\nIMO calling cops for parties is shitty too, although I understand that's probably an unpopular opinion. I don't believe in involving cops in things unless somebody's in danger or a serious crime has been committed, but that's just me. (noise is not a serious crime)", "Found the doormat", "No, with the dog being a good neighbor is not killing the dog. I have every right to kill an animal that is a danger to myself or my animals. It is 100% on the owners to control their dog.", "Yes, they are leagues away. And I still do not find it normal to shoot dog that jumped your fence. It is beyond extreme response.\n\nI find OP responses extreme in general. That some other people are too infatuated with shootings guns does not mean OP response was not extreme, just that there are subcultures that are even more extereme.", "Agree with you. Plus in this case there\u2019s already a fence, but apparently the neighbors wanted to put in a higher one. That\u2019s absolutely not OP\u2019s responsibility.", "This literally has nothing to do with the dog next door.\n\nCats are native bird murder machines. They should not be let outside to roam, period.", "The neighbors had an aggressive dog that could and did escape their yard multiple times, and tried to attack OP\u2019s pets.\n\nIn response she talked to the neighbor and told them if it happened again she would call the police.  That is not extreme, that is responsible - at least involving the authorities.  Animal control or the equivalent would be much better than involving the police, depending on local available services.\n\nThe neighbors were going to get their dog killed with their irresponsible pet ownership.  Ignore the risk of guns - that dog was more likely to get run over than shot.", "then they should either control, leash, or watch their dog. if it goes into OPs yard to chase HER cats then she has every roght to call animal control on theyre butts", "Who knows what they're stealing from a package on a doorstep?", "A lot of vets use human medicine since it's works the same on animals and is a lot less expensive. So it's not cat medicine, it's just medicine. What if it was, oh I don't know, benzos? One of my moms dogs takes two different kinds of benzos, both of which are the full on human versions of the medicine.", "Someone with a vendetta", "it\u2019s relevant in that OP is an asshole for putting them in harm\u2019s way. even if there wasn\u2019t a dog next door, they\u2019re an invasive species and usually get hit by a car or killed by another animal. letting your cats out is an AH move regardless of how much of an AH anyone else is", "Tom Waits.", "Holy fuck you can't just commit a murder like that. Bouta be a double homicide bc you got me dying of laughter with that", "r/murderedbywords", "I don't believe in crosses dude. Maybe get off the stick you have inserted where the sun don't shine and recognise that community is about consideration and respect for those around you.", "Well sure but does her cats enter their yard? Because that is what I am referring to. If her cats wander into their yard then they can and might kill them. And I'm a cat person, not a dog person but responsible pet ownership of cats is keeping them indoors or in an enclosure. I honestly would have cared about MY cats so gone halves on a reasonable fence for BOTH houses."]}
