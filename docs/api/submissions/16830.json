It was left to me by my mother after she passed away 10 years ago.  About 4 years ago, a couple about my age moved in next door and we've pretty much been at odds since day one.  There have been numerous times and issues that we've disagreed on.\n\nI have 3 cats that I sometimes let out into my backyard.  My neighbors have a dog that would jump the 5-foot chain link fence separating our yards to chase my cats.  I told my neighbors if I caught their dog doing it again, I would call the cops.  They actually had the audacity to ask if I would be willing to split the cost of a taller privacy fence instead of, you know, training your dog not to jump the fence.  Obviously, I refused as I wasn't the one causing the problem and the fence is technically on their property anyway.  They ended up putting in a taller fence.  \n\nThen, they asked me to split the cost of taking down an Ash tree that was on their property.  It had become infested with some bug that killed the tree and dead limbs were falling on their driveway.  They had the city come out and the survey guy said the tree was actually about 10% on my property.  I told them the tree was theirs and if they want it down, they'll have to pay for it because I don't have a problem with it.  \n\nNeedless to say, we're not friends.  They've also thrown some loud, late-night parties that included bonfires and loud music that I had to call the cops for as well.  \n\nI am currently out of town visiting family for a couple weeks.  I have a friend who comes over to my house everyday to check on my cats and check for mail and packages.  I have medication for my cats that are delivered regularly.  \n\nI got a notification the other day that some packages were delivered, so I texted my friend to let them know.  But before my friend could get there, I got a notification from my Ring doorbell.   I pulled up the live feed and saw my neighbor on my patio.  I asked him what he was doing and he said a package of theirs got delivered to my house by mistake so he was just grabbing it.  \n\nI told him to leave and that my friend would bring over his package when she comes over.  He said he's not waiting for that and tried to leave.  I told him if he takes a package from my porch I'm calling the cops.  He shoved the package in front of the camera and said \"That's my name and address, OP.  I'm taking my package.\"  Then he walked away.  So, I called the police and told them that he stole a package from me and I have video proof.  They said they would investigate.  \n\nWhen my friend got there a little later, the police were talking to my neighbors.  The police must have left while she was checking on my cats, because when she went to leave it was just my neighbors outside.  \n\nThe husband yelled at her to tell me that I'm a huge asshole and that I need to take the police off speed-dial and let them deal with more important sh!t instead of using them as my own personal problem-solving service.", "created_utc": 1683662946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d4hsv/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_neighbor_after/", "score": 324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you seriously called the police on someone for taking THEIR OWN PACKAGE off your porch? You're not just an asshole. You're a flaming asshole.", "YTA. Why would you call the police when you clearly saw that it was the neighbour's package? Then you provided the police with proof that you knew it was his. You just made yourself look like an idiot.", "YTA. The fence, sure I get it. The tree\u2026. Meh. They just didn\u2019t want to pony up the cash. Depending on time and noise level I will even give a pass on tackling the cops. But her shoved the package in front of the camera to show you it was his. And the police have better fucking things to do. So call them when it\u2019s an emergency only.", "How could they have known their name and address were on the package without trespassing in the first place?", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to be decent to one another. And being blunt & nipping any further issues in the bud is not necessarily a bad approach.  \n\nThe fence is there for a reason & neighbors need to control their dog. It\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for a taller fence to keep their dog from going over it & terrorizing your cats.  And was the package REALLY the neighbors? He could have held it up to the ring camera & showed you. \n\nSo, the loud parties? I can\u2019t imagine that they would have quieted down if you asked nicely. Rarely do neighbors ever show consideration to others in regards to not disturbing the peace so late at night.\n\nAnd the tree? Why the fuck should you pay anything toward helping them remove it? 10% on your property? So? The tree is on their property & that is the cost of owning one\u2019s home. \n\nYou all don\u2019t have to be good friends just to be good neighbors.  Maybe if they were decent from the beginning in regards to their dog jumping the fence, then you might not be so quick to call the police.", "YTA, it was their package. They literally showed you that it was theirs and you called the cops anyway. \n\nYour neighbor is right, the police aren\u2019t your personal grievance service. If being a shitty neighbor got someone jail time you\u2019d be a lifer.", "Wait, was the neighbors' address on the package?  WTF did OP call the cops?  It's not OP's package.\n\nI get that the neighbor has issues, but calling the cops for the package was an AH move.\n\nYTA", "YTA. The fence thing is their responsibility since it\u2019s their dog causing the issue, you maybe should\u2019ve pitched in on the tree thing, it\u2019s rude to call the police on your neighbors without talking to them first, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s illegal to withhold someone else\u2019s mail. I get that you have your differences, but you are doing absolutely nothing to try and settle them.", "YTA", "YTA and a terrible neighbor.", "I think YTA, since it was their package. He even said his name was on it and showed you through the camera before you called the police. He can\u2019t steal a package from you if it wasn\u2019t yours to begin with.

If anybody is a thief it's you, OP.", "YTA, %100. \n\nAsking to split the cost of a fence is normal, as fences usually share boundary lines between houses. My neighbor and I are going to do that exact thing this summer.\n\nAsking about the tree was iffy, but if some part of it is on your property...what's the issue?\n\nCalling the cops on them for taking their own package? Wow. YTA and an insufferable one from the sounds of it. You're the problem here, not them.", "You sound like an awful neighbor. They were just looking for their package, which they rightfully theirs. Calm down. I'm actually surprised you have a friend that would look after your cats. Maybe you should socialize more. Your neighbors could be cool to hang out with.", "Yta", "wow OP, it's you. YTA", "YTA. If you\u2019re in the US, calling the cops over every single interaction isn\u2019t just annoying, it\u2019s dangerous. There\u2019s no reason to have escalated things this far. Chill the fuck out.", "YTA - glad you aren't my neighbor... you sound fun.  Seriously calling the cops on them for picking up their package. You need to be more human.", "Yes. You are an AH and sound like a miserable neighbour.", "YTA. You're a nightmare who needs to workout your issues. My lord. The tree and fence are normal neighbor issues, not a cause for ill will. You calling the cops at every turn is abnormal.", "YTA. You have escalated everything. The package was his. He showed you his name on it and still called the cops. If I were your neighbor, I would hate it.", "YTA", "INFO: do you think that because you've lived there longer, it gives you more authority in the neighbourhood? Also do you have a lopsided haircut with chunky highlights?\n\nCalling the cops after they showed you it was indeed their package makes you an AH. The fence would benefit you both, more privacy and safety for all pets involved. The tree well, its on them but the nice thing to do would have been to pitch in 10%. Being neighbourly can save your life or help find perpetrators of a crime. \n\nYTA\n\nLearn how to be sociable.", "Imagine the police coming to solve a kindergarten fight. It was his package, so YTA", "YTA. They took THEIR package off of your porch. Probably because they (fairly) assumed you would be spiteful and return to sender instead of being a good neighbor and walking it over. You're the bad neighbor that's creating the problems", "YTA Your neighbor doesn\u2019t sound great, but you sound pretty terrible.  Stop calling the cops.", "So much unnecessary escalation.", "YTA. He literally showed you that it was his package; he showed you the proof", "YTA\n\nEven with the tree, my foot would be down on not paying. What would be the 10%? the branches that over hang the property line? or part of a root?  The tree wasn't planted on OP's property, so shall bare no responsibility towards it. \n\nHowever, my family had to go 50% on a fence rebuild cause, even though it was on their property it considered \"communal\" as it ran the length of the property line. \n\nIf anything with the cops called on the last instance, they were technically trespassing.
