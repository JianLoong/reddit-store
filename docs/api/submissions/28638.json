This has been so since they moved away for different reasons and we use this as a way to bond with them and for them to see each other\n\nMy sons (Jack 32M and Harry 35M) visit us every year and we have a great time together. My daughter (Alice - 31F) lives about an hour away from us by plane with her family. This includes her wife (Vanessa - 35F), and their two kids (6 year old son, 4 year old daughter). They come visit us on my husband's birthday or mine if they can. They've never been with us for the holidays since they got together 10 years ago.\n\nThe reason for this is, Vanessa is a surgeon and she always has to work, including the holidays. This year, I again invited them and Alice declined the invitation for the very same reason as every year. I suggested that the kids were now older, and maybe Alice could fly out alone with them and stay with us for a few days while Vanessa kept on with her work.\n\nAlice told me she there was no way she would spend the holidays away from her wife. I told her how her kids were missing out on the chance to spend time with their cousins and I'm sure they'd have fun if they came over. She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city. I may be an AH because I again told her it wouldn't hurt anyone if she came over just a few days, and I said I was sure Vanessa could handle that.\n\nShe got mad at me this time and said she honestly only wanted to be with Vanessa and the kids, and that they used this time to bond together as a family. She also called me pushy and selfish for not understanding where she's coming from, and said I was being unreasonable by asking her to abandon her wife during the holidays.\n\nMy husband and Jack are on my side but Harry thinks we went too far with the insisting.

I told her how her kids were missing out on the chance to spend time with their cousins and I'm sure they'd have fun if they came over. She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city. I may be an AH because I again told her it wouldn't hurt anyone if she came over just a few days, and I said I was sure Vanessa could handle that.\n\nOnce she'd already told you she wasn't going to spend the holidays away from her wife you should have either suggested a solution where she didn't have to, or you should have dropped it. Instead you continued to push for the solution that you wanted and that only benefitted you. It's disrespectful to ignore someone's \"no\" just because you don't like that they won't do the thing you want them to do.\n\nIf this is truly about just getting to see your daughter and her kids more, I'd apologize for pushing too much and ask if she is willing to brainstorm a solution for next year so that you can all spend time together and she doesn't have to leave her wife to do so (celebrating one of the holidays on a different weekend when her wife is available, you flying to her, whatever the case may be).", "It sounds like your daughter and her family make an effort to see you on your birthdays, and even a \"an hour away by plane\" with two small children *during the holiday season* is not a lot of fun.  Since \"No\" is a complete sentence, and you kept arguing with your daughter to abandon her spouse on a holiday and upset her, YTA. Sorry, Mom.", "YTA. First of all, an hour by plane is closer to 5-6 hours of travel time after dealing with all the airport BS. Secondly, you are expecting her to travel at the most expensive, unpredictable, busiest time of the year.\n\nBut mostly the issues is that you are demanding she abandon her wife over the holidays. Think of how you would feel if your husband took the kids and left you alone for Christmas. Even if you had somewhere to go, you would be heartbroken that he did that to you. You asked, and your daughter said no. She is an adult, and you need to respect that. All you are doing is driving her away.", "YTA  You got too pushy.\n\nYou don't get them for Christmas.  It's just not in the cards with Vanessa's current role/responsibilities.  If you keep pushing, you'll get fewer visits on you and husband's birthdays.\n\nAllow a story.  My grandmother (dad's mom) insisted that all 4 of her kids and her grandkids come to her on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My mom, one year, decided that she wanted to do her own turkey for lunch, invite her parents,  and swing by later to visit.  Grandma hit the roof and said impolite things.  Dad, 100x more stubborn than me, put his foot down, told her to stop being an ass, or we wouldn't come a Christmas, either.  She hit the roof again, and dad was true to his word.  We never again did either  holiday at grandma's.  Then, the other 3 kids pulled back, too.\n\nThat's your life if you keep being an asshole.", "Why don't you, Husband, your sons and their famiilies rent a place where Alice and Vanessa lives so you can spend Christmas with them?\n\nVanessa isn't at the point in her career where she gets enough time off at Christmas that travelling is practical, so you need to decide what is more important spending Christmas in your home or spending Christmas with your whole family.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYour intentions? Good. \n\nYour invitation? Good.\n\nYou refusing to accept a polite \"no\" and pushing for her to do what you demanded? Asshole.\n\nListen to your daughter and give her the basic respect she deserves. This isn't all about you.", "YTA for not understanding that your grandkids would want to spend as much of the holiday as they could with their mother, and that your daughter would want to with her wife.  Also for assuming that a 4 and 6 year old kid are \"older\" and wouldn't want a Christmas holiday at their home.   \n\n\nIf you got your way, think of how the holiday would be for Vanessa; she'd go to work, come home on a major holiday to an empty house, with her beloved wife and kids far away. That's heartbreaking.", "I get why you'd want to be with all your family for the holidays.\n\nBut *they* are also a family, and asking your daughter to split that family over the holidays \u2013 and then pushing the issue when she'd firmly said no \u2013 is really disrespectful of that.\n\nHow would it hurt nobody for Vanessa to be left at home alone, but hurt the kids not to be with their cousins? You're prioritising your wishes over theirs (ETA: Alice and Vanessa's), so YTA. \n\nOut of interest, if it was one of your sons in this situation, would you genuinely ask them to leave their wife at home and bring their kids without her for the holidays?", "Why don't you all go to Vanessa and Alice? Rent a cute Airbnb and spend time with them. I don't know why it's Alice and Vanessa who have to literally risk other people's lives (given Vanessa's career) to go see you.\n\nyes, YTA", "YTA for insisting. It's good that you invite them and let them know they are always welcome, but that you are like \"well just leave your wife at home\" is not cool. Also the kid's are still young they are going to want to be with both parents on holidays. If you are so concerned with the kids missing out on time with their cousins, maybe next year you guys can all rent an airbnb around where your daughter lives and you guys do the traveling instead.", "Why don\u2019t you leave your spouse at home and travel to Alice\u2019s for the holidays?", "YTA.  You can't expect your daughter and grandchildren to leave her wife alone during the holidays.  Holidays are already very stressful and it sounds like your daughter-in-law has an especially stressful job and your daughter wants to stay home to celebrate with her.  How could you expect your daughter to leave her home alone?\n\nIf everyone else is willing to travel to visit *you*, why can't everyone just travel to *her* to be together instead of expecting her to leave the person she loves all alone?  Your unwillingness to see her side of this and accept her reasons is pretty selfish, IMO.", "YTA. Jesus Christ she is telling you she wants to enjoy Christmas with her wife and kids. Stop bothering her and trying to push her to see you instead. You're not her nuclear family anymore, and the kids deserve to spend Christmas with their parents (both of them!). You selfishly wanting them to abandon her wife/their mom so you can have them at your house is beyond disrespectful. Leave them alone and don't ask again, else I promise you will ruin your relationship with them. \n\nYou. Are. Not. Their. Nuclear. Family. \n\nLet them be.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter clearly said no she didn't want to leave her wife for the holiday and they already have plans at home.  That is where you should have stopped. You were pushy. Stop dragging other people in to take sides. Their opinion doesn't matter in this.\n\nIt is important for a lot of busy families to spend their precious holiday moments together in a relaxed way not fighting through crowded airports as the solo parent while your spouse misses the entire holiday with your young kids. \n\nPlan a big family get together on one of your birthdays when they can manage to travel as a family instead.", "I'm going with very soft YTA.\n\nBased on what you said, you don't seem to recognize that your daughter has her own family now, setting their own traditions.  In my fam, my mom calls it \"passing the baton\".  \n\nWhat complicated things is my generation scattered to the winds.  Before that, it was all local.  My sister inherited 2 kids and quickly popped out 2 more.   She was in Texas and they set their traditions, inviting anyone who could make it.  They didn't travel for Christmas until the kids were older and my parents took early retirement in FL.  They turned it into a vacation type thing.", "YTA. Why are your holiday traditions more important than Alice and Vanessa's? \n\nYou already said that Vanessa is a surgeon, that she is constantly working and that her time off is precious, so why wouldn't you want her to have every minute she has spare to spend it with Alice and their children the way you want to with yours? \n\nI'm guessing you're a Christian so here's a reminder, Christmas is a time of goodwill to all men, try and show some to your daughter and stop trying to guilt her into doing something she doesn't want to.", "YTA and dismissive of your daughters relationship with her wife. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u201d and \u201cI was simply asking her to leave her wife alone\u201d \n\nDo you not hear yourself? I hope this is fake because otherwise you didn\u2019t actually absorb the words you wrote out and how ridiculous it sounds for you to demand your daughters attention and not understanding why she\u2019d say no.", "YTA. She\u2019s prioritizing her nuclear family which is healthy and normal. She visits you at other times. She was honest and specific in her reasoning. You just sealed her choices with your pushiness. Why not change YOUR routine? You don\u2019t have a monopoly on Christmas. My sister is also about an hour away by plane and a health care worker. The rest of us are married with various holiday obligations. My family picks a weekend in December that works for everyone to get together and have \u201cChristmas\u201d and I\u2019m so grateful that they do this instead of acting entitled to our whole day like you are.", "YTA.  You get to ask, once.  And then you have to respect the no.  Here's the thing - it's a lot of work to travel with young kids.  It's also a lot of work to travel over the holidays.  And your daughter's family is not available for holiday travel anyway.  You get to sit in your house and wait for people to come to you, while you insist that your daughter travel over the holidays by herself with two young kids, leaving her spouse alone.  That's not great!  Maybe, if you want to see all your kids at the same time, you need to plan a visit when all of them are actually available.", "YTA and your son is correct.\n\nYour daughter has her own family now and has made the decision to spend Christmas with them in their own home which is entirely reasonable. What is unreasonable is you expecting your wants to supercede hers. So accept that she will not be there for Christmas, this entails saying that you are disappointed but understand and no more follow ups about it, no begging, no dropping little hints, no passive aggressive snarky comments or you won't even get a birthday visit.", "Yes, YTA\n\nYou want to split up a family at Christmas time. They are a family.  Think how you'd feel if your husband took your kids to his family by plane during Christmas when the kids were young and left you home all alone because you had to work.\n\nVanessa isn't working every single minute. She still has time to spend with your daughter and their children.  This would be very hurtful to leave a family member by themselves just because they have to work.  \n\nYou should apologize for being thoughtless about this situation. You really weren't thinking about anyone else's wishes other than yours.  Sure it would be nice to have the whole family there for Christmas, but what about Vanessa?  Don't you even consider her feelings? Or how  much the kids will miss their mom at Christmas?", "YTA\n\nYour kids come visit \u201chome\u201d when they first move away and before they develop their own roots. \n\nOnce your kids start having kids, it\u2019s time to drop the \u201chome for the holidays\u201d mentality.  It\u2019s time for the parents to travel.  Especially when it\u2019s a family with children having to travel instead of 2 healthy, adults. \n\nMy parents lost out on a relationship with my family because they were set in their ways about their house being the only place acceptable to celebrate holidays. My brother lived 10 min away.  I was 60 minutes away, 2 children under 2 and a disability.", "YTA, you should have accepted her answer the first time she said no. Her wife won't be working 24hrs a day and will still have some time to see her children and wife and that shouldn't be taken away from her, especially with the ages of their children. \nYou need to apologise for being pushy and learn to accept that your daughter has her own family now who will always come first.", "Sorry but YTA. It sucks when people you want to see don\u2019t want to see you as much back, but nobody owns you their company, not even your child. It makes sense that they all want to be together during Christmas and that your daughter doesn\u2019t want to travel alone on plane with two small kids (when everyone else is travelling). \n\nBetter to bring up with her that you want to see them more and ask if they have any suggestions what to how. If they don\u2019t, then respect their boundaries and learn to regulate your own emotions of disappointment. It\u2019s okay to be disappointed when you were hoping for something, but it\u2019s not okay to place your disappointment on somebody else when they\u2019re just honouring their boundaries. Pushing people to see you is not the way to go if you want more of them in your life.", "YTA. It\u2019s very clear that your daughter now has her OWN family traditions around Christmas and that is to spent time with the family she has made for herself. She placed a boundary and you are continuously trying to circumvent that boundary year after year. No - she isn\u2019t going to leave her wife on Christmas just because you want to see her and the kids. If you actually wanted to make an effort? What is so difficult about going down to visit her and the family she has made for herself - not on Christmas. Make another \u201cChristmas\u201d because her wife\u2019s work constraints will not allow them to visit you.", "YTA\n\nI would never leave my spouse alone on Christmas, let alone take my young children away from them.  Only a massive AH would push this.", "Yta why don't *you* go visit them?", "YTA - she gave you the answer the first time. That\u2019s not an invitation to keep pushing. When someone says no, listen.", "YTA. Why are you allowed your Christmas tradition but they aren\u2019t?\n\nYou could travel to visit them for the holidays, but my guess is you won\u2019t. \n\nWhen my children reached middle school / junior high age we told our parents we wanted to create our own traditions. Each year, one side of the family was invited as we had always switched off holidays before that.  My MIL understood but my mother was upset. Her entire marriage she celebrated the holidays in her and my dad\u2019s home, but we were not supposed to enjoy that same privilege. \n\nThe first year she came to our home. It was nothing but passive-aggressive comments about how it didn\u2019t feel like the holidays. That was over twenty years ago and I swore I would never treat my children this way. I have enjoyed Christmas with everyone in my home, Christmas in my children\u2019s homes, and Christmas without any of my children or grandchildren. All without the need to guilt anyone over their holiday decisions.", "Maybe Alice is LC with you and you can't recognize this because you've always been dismissive of her wants and needs.\n\nAlso, YTA.", "YTA \n\nYour daughter has created a new family. Asking her to leave behind a member of her core family is not only selfish but rude.", "YTA why aren\u2019t you visiting your daughter for the holidays?  Have you ever done so?  Have you ever proposed to? I\u2019m sick of the fake nice passive aggressive bullshit mom your daughter and her family deserve much better", "YTA. \n\nThey have a job that doesn't let them travel at the holidays, and I'm grateful to them and the millions of people who have jobs that restrict how they spend the holidays for our safety and comfort. \n\nIn the last 10 years, instead of being like...oh Vanessa works, how about we see if we can all go to their location one year, you just keep expecting them to come to you. \n\nWhy would it be so hard to alternate holidays in different cities? And if one of your children didn't want to host, fine, but how about asking your daughter if she would host Christmas one year and you all come to them?", "YTA \nYour daughter is right,  you ate pushy and selfish. Your daughter wants herself and her children to spend the holidays with her wife and for the kids to be around both parents. She's married and her wife and kids are more important than you,  time to get over yourself.", "YTA - you don\u2019t *have* to celebrate Christmas in Christmas. Why haven\u2019t you in 10yrs try to hang out with the other siblings on a different day?", "INFO: why can't you host the families on another festival?", "YTA. You invited them and they declined the invitation. This is when you let it go. But instead, you wanted her to stay home alone for the holidays without her family and are throwing a hissy fit because she said no. \n\nKind of selfish of you to push what you want with every excuse you can think of so that your daughter can be alone for the holidays. She already has a highly stressful job to do, and her family time is just as precious.\n\nPick another holiday or time when she can take off and invite all those cousins so everyone can have \u201cfamily\u201d time you are so desperate for. It doesn\u2019t have to be Christmas", "YTA. Lots of people here giving you the solution. Go visit your daughter\u2019s family if you want to see them for Christmas. You really think your grandkids would want to  spend time with you and their cousins for a few days, but mommy couldn\u2019t come? They are a family and have their traditions. At what point did you stop going to your parents or in laws for the holidays?", "YTA. Your daughter has the right to spend Christmas where she wishes and you should not be pressuring her. \n\nYou say that they are only an hour away by plane. Especially if you live in a northern climate with possible snow storms over the holiday, plane travel over the busiest holiday of the year can be risky if Vanessa has to be back at a certain time. There are always delays and cancellations due to weather and traffic volume. Christmas travel can be stressful.\n\nAlice has called you pushy and selfish. Do you think that might be the real reason why she doesn't want to be with you over a holiday that can be stressful with strong personalities clashing. I remember how peaceful and pleasant our Christmas was one year when the roads were closed and we were forced to stay home. It was wonderful! I don't blame Alice for wanting that.", "So you\u2019re saying that they have had the exact same arrangement for the exact same reasons for *10 years* and you still can\u2019t drop it?\n\nYou realize that Vanessa and her side of their family matters too, right? It\u2019s not like they never see you, by your own admission they make time to come visit as a family annually.\n\nGiven how selfish and dismissive you are being about this I\u2019m surprised they come to visit you at all.\n\nYTA", "YTA i had a mother in law like you. The insistence all Christmas's had to be spent with her not my husband and children or god forbid my parents was a nightmare we opted out after 2 years, we spent christmas with each other and our children. When my children got partners I said to them all where they spent Christmas was up to them I wasn't going to guilt them into anything. We now have afternoon tea somewhere really nice between Christmas and new year and have a great time and there's no cooking cleaning or washing up!", "YTA what part of the word no do you not understand the n or the o?", "YTA for pushing, not for asking. You were fine asking and fine suggesting she come without her wife, but once she said no you crossed over in YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps you can set up a time where she would be able to come over, maybe a few weeks before or after Xmas when things are a bit calmer.", "You're not the AH for asking once, but you went over the like by pushing. You may be \"sure they'd have fun\" and you may be \"sure Vanessa could handle that\" but it's not your decision. I bet your daughter is sure her wife doesn't want to be alone for the holidays.\n\nAnd you haven't hosted all your kids for ten years. It's just your son and his family. Your daughter, her wife, and their kids have their own holiday traditions by now. Let them enjoy them.\n\nYou might also consider going to see them sometime, not at the holidays. Roads and planes go both ways.", "YTA for pushing/insisting. You offered, she said no thank you. That should have been the end of the discussion.", "YTA. As a parent, you would have taught your daughter that no means no, so I don\u2019t understand why you have forgotten what it means. \n\nIf this really is about spending more time with your daughter and her family, you will make the effort to go to them.", "Can you plan now for Christmas 2024?", "YTA", "I mean...you could always change the time you celebrate holidays to maybe work for the other family? That's what my family does because we all have other families too.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't ask, you crossed the line and demanded.", "YTA, Harry is correct. The invitation itself is not the problem. It\u2019s the insisting and guilt tripping that followed her answer that makes you the AH. If this is how it is every-time, I\u2019m not surprised they only see you twice a year.", "YTA. You\u2019re not the AH for asking, you\u2019re the AH for not respecting her answer. Your daughter is grown with a life, and she gets to decide what would \u201churt\u201d people or not. It sounds like you didn\u2019t even try to understand her position, you just wanted what you wanted and were rude and disrespectful when you didn\u2019t get your way.", "YTA. Sorry but Xmas holidays with parents trump Xmas holidays with grandparents. They are immediate family, you\u2019re just extended family.", "Your children are adults now. They have their own families. What you need to do now (and what you should\u2019ve done years ago) is celebrate the holidays with everyone together ON A DIFFERENT DAY. Say a weekend that WORKS FOR EVERYONE. \n\nThis is what we\u2019ve always done with my extended family and what my ex husband\u2019s extended family. This isn\u2019t hard. You talk/email all the relevant parties ask if you can come up with a day to celebrate together. Does December 2nd, 16th of January 6th work for everyone?\n\nYTA for expecting your daughter to conform to what you want when IT DOESN\u2019T WORK FOR HER FAMILY.", "For all the people saying \"go to them\", that's also not a thing you get to do without negotiation.  If the whole family descended on my place at Christmas when I was younger in my career, I couldn't have seen them.  And some smaller families want their own Christmases without the drama that extended family would bring.  And you cannot tell me, after this post, that this extended family does not come with drama.  Alice, Vanessa, and their kids deserve the Christmas they want.", "YTA. Families with little kids often opt to make Christmas nuclear-family only. They make precious memories that way, and it's a lot less stressful than hauling everybody through airports at the busiest time of year. Plus she wants to be supportive of her wife.", "If Vanessa has been a surgeon for 10 years, there is no way she's been oncall every one of those years, unless she volunteered to be oncall. Just, fyi.", "YTA. I don't see what you thought you'd accomplish here - if Alice were interested in or willing to visit for Christmas without her wife, she'd do so. Why would you try and 'insist' when you have zero leverage? Nobody ever enjoyed something more for being guilt-tripped into it.", "YTA for being pushy but...\n\n>She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city.\n\nSomething about this doesn't sit right with me. Do they spend every Christmas with Vanessa's family?\n\nWith the couples I know, if one of them has family in town and the other has family out of town, they take special care to alternate big holidays. It's not fair to spend them with the local family because odds are they already see more of the couple throughout the course of the year.\n\nAgain, it's completely up to your daughter and her wife where they want to spend the holidays. But it seems a little odd that they have NEVER allowed you to spend Christmas with your grandkids.", "NAH. You want to see your daughter during the holidays, but she has to do what\u2019s best for her family now. You are on thin ice though, beck cause you were being a bit pushy. YWBTA if you keep pushing.", "YTA- you can go visit her or plan a holiday get together on a different weekend or even plan a family get together at a different time of the year. Her wife shouldn\u2019t be left alone just because her schedule doesn\u2019t fit what you\u2019d like it to", "YTA. You could travel to her. You sure sound pushy. You run the risk of pushing her away completely.", "NAH....but you're close.\n\nNot knowing the context of how your positioned was delivered (suggestively, definitively, etc) it's tough to say if you were in problem-solving mode or intrusive-parent mode. Even if you were in problem-solving mode your suggestions may have come across as insensitive. Suggesting that your grandkids leave their mother behind for Christmas is a bit cold. \n\nFWIW, we have a child who lives out of state and our position has been that it's our responsibility as the parents to carry the majority of the burden related to getting together. Your kids are in their prime family-rearing and career development phases of their life. They're busy...very busy. As the parent, it's most likely that you have more flexibility and resources on hand to find the right ways to stay connected.\n\nChristmas and other holidays will always be tough for you as a parent out of state. It's just the way it is. If this is a major issue for you, get creative and find solutions that your kids can get excited about. If they're interested and excited, they'll find a way to make it work if it's within their ability to do so.", "You are NTA for asking.\n\nNo means no.\n\nYou are TA for continuing to push her boundary.", "NTA- I think you just miss your daughter and your grandchildren. Ultimately, you do need to respect her decision or you would be the asshole. Perhaps after the holidays, they could fly to you or you to them?", "I\u2019m getting low-key homophobia vibes. Like it\u2019s okay to leave her wife at home alone because it\u2019s not the same as a \u201creal\u201d marriage.\n\nI may be reading something into it that truly isn\u2019t there, but I just can\u2019t shake the idea that if one of her sons said no, OP would accept it and find a compromise. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nEither way, YTA. Hugely.", "yta - Look, your daughter is grown and has her own family obligations now. If all the cousins miss her and her kids so much, they would arrange to see them.\n\nThe more you guilt her about it, the less she will want to come visit at all.", "There are a lot of days in the year- maybe ask her and your sons to help pick a weekend when they can all gather for a family reunion.

This has been so since they moved away for different reasons and we use this as a way to bond with them and for them to see each other\n\nMy sons (Jack 32M and Harry 35M) visit us every year and we have a great time together. My daughter (Alice - 31F) lives about an hour away from us by plane with her family. This includes her wife (Vanessa - 35F), and their two kids (6 year old son, 4 year old daughter). They come visit us on my husband's birthday or mine if they can. They've never been with us for the holidays since they got together 10 years ago.\n\nThe reason for this is, Vanessa is a surgeon and she always has to work, including the holidays. This year, I again invited them and Alice declined the invitation for the very same reason as every year. I suggested that the kids were now older, and maybe Alice could fly out alone with them and stay with us for a few days while Vanessa kept on with her work.\n\nAlice told me she there was no way she would spend the holidays away from her wife. I told her how her kids were missing out on the chance to spend time with their cousins and I'm sure they'd have fun if they came over. She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city. I may be an AH because I again told her it wouldn't hurt anyone if she came over just a few days, and I said I was sure Vanessa could handle that.\n\nShe got mad at me this time and said she honestly only wanted to be with Vanessa and the kids, and that they used this time to bond together as a family. She also called me pushy and selfish for not understanding where she's coming from, and said I was being unreasonable by asking her to abandon her wife during the holidays.\n\nMy husband and Jack are on my side but Harry thinks we went too far with the insisting.

Christmas was spent at our house every year. This was always my parents, their kids, my maternal grandma, my moms two brother and my paternal grandfather till he passed away. This is what my sibling and I thought was normal. \n\nAs kids do we got older and my sister eventually met her husband. He too had family traditions around the holidays. Traditions his family expected him to continue. So they spent the first year trying to do both. \n\nNot long after the first holiday my mom got brain cancer and for two years they struggled. They have every Christmas Eve to his family since that was big in theirs and every Christmas to mine. It was exhausting for them to travel so much over a short time. They never had a holiday that was just them. My mom only survived for 3 years and my dad unilaterally decided we all had to go to his sisters for Christmas. Our mom just died so we relented the first year. However this became the norm for my dad and we his children who wanted to spend time with just him was ignored. \n\nMy dad passed away a few years ago and my sister at this point became a mom.  It became difficult with a baby to deal with it all. She asked my dad if we could do a visit to them the day after. He refused and argued with us on his last Christmas. If he had survived today my sister and I would never go back. \n\nWhile your family you grew up with is family so to is the family you married into. You can\u2019t honor only one around the holidays.

Before COVID we gathered at my MIL's for New Years Eve every year because Christmas had too many complications.", "Sorry, but YTA. At Christmas, the nuclear family comes first. You are now the extended family; your daughter's children are entitled to have memories of Christmas in their own home, with both their parents. Not to mention, in case you don't know, traveling by air, with young children, at Christmas time, is a fate no one would wish on people they love. Now back off, before your daughter decides she doesn't ever want to spend time at your house.

I was perfectly healthy on December 16 last year. On December 17 I was admitted to the hospital with a 20cm mass in my abdomen. I had surgery on the 21st and got discharged on the 24th. My surgeon had to come into the hospital on Christmas Eve to let me go home. \n\nThat is what a surgeon working over the holidays looks like. Not just cutting people open. OP is just so selfish.", "If the other kids pulled back, it seems like something more happened besides just some impolite words...", "OP, your daughter-in-law won't be working Christmases forever, that's a job that's typically dumped on the newest doctor at the practice.  And someday she won't be the newest doctor at the practice, before long I'm sure some other doctor will join and she will have seniority over them, and the new person will be expected to work through Christmas.\n\nAnd that is the year that you'll find out whether your daughter-in-law can tolerate the idea of spending Christmas with the in-laws.", "YTA. No, is a one word answer. Honestly, even if Vanessa wasn\u2019t a surgeon and they lived in your city, it would still be perfectly fine to say no. I would. Christmas is my time with my family. You had your time when your kids were little.", "THIS!  We have made same decision.  Pisses off my parents but I don\u2019t care.  I only get so many Christmas\u2019 until they are grown and I\u2019m taking them all!!", "If it's really about getting the whole family together,  they could do a big summer bash every year or something. Cheaper, easier to manage PTO, and no crazy holiday travel.", "My guess is as a surgeon working Christmas, she's likely staff in an ER or trauma center, not a practice. She may never have Christmas off.   \nOP, YTA. Is this the only time Alice would see her brothers? Ask yourself why that may be the case.   \nYou are now extended family, Vanessa and her children are her extended family. If you can't/won't travel to her, you will simply have to make other arrangements. That's life.", "My dad insists on this mindset.

There are multiple surgeons in the unit, of course, but they're all specialized in \"their type\" pretty much. So a kidney comes in Kidney guy is called. Heart comes in, heart guy is called etc", "This entirely. It gives me the same sort of vibes of my own situation with my family. They are very pushy about me coming to visit, and while yes I could make the extra effort...I don't, because I have reasons why I don't. Reasons they just ignore, don't acknowledge and some they probably even decided to 'forget' about. \n\nI am thinking that while it's probably not for the same reasons as mine, but that Alice has other reasons why she doesn't want to go.", "Doesn't sound like mom really respects their relationship.

Maybe you are unaware, but surgeries happen on holidays too. I'm thankful to your daughter in law for sacrificing family time to have other people not die.", "> because of how demanding her wife's career is and she can't take days off easily. At least that's what she tells me\n\nShe's a surgeon, she's always in demand. Her time is dictated by her patients' needs.

Would you rather they travel only out of obligation and resent every minute of it?", "Why can't her brothers travel to see her and make sure their kids know their cousins? Why is it all on your daughter to make sacrifices and not on your sons? Sexist much?", "Why can't you all meet near your daughter", "NTA op. \n\nThey obviously just don\u2019t want to come to you or to say so. Ten years of never having a Christmas Day holiday is unrealistic. I totally get your point and the kids are missing out but that is what the parents have chosen to do so not much you can do about it. Best to accept it than to strain your relationship with them.", "My husbands step dads family always hosts Christmas with all of us the week after Christmas. Most of us usually have some vacation or holiday time and it will be a random Thursday and we spend ALL day with them and it\u2019s amazing. Instead of rushing between all the houses between Christmas and Christmas Eve we know we get dedicated time with them", "Or rent an AirBnB in her city and host everyone there....", "That\u2019s you; not everyone is you or shares your opinions. I would absolutely never spend Christmas away from my son while he was a child.", "\u201cOnly sees her daughter twice a year\u201d Only? \n\u2014 This is the US. Very few of us get more than 2, maybe 3, weeks of vacation in the early decades \u2014 the ones during which our children are little. Most at some point resent having to spend all or even most of their vacation time traveling to see family. \n\u2014 An hour flight (only 1.5 hours on the plane if you\u2019re lucky). Plus time to travel to the airport. Plus arrive two hours before departure. Arrive. Add time to get baggage. Add time to get rental car - unless OP & hubby will lend them a car. Add time to drive to OP\u2019s home. \n\u2014 Tickets cost money. Four tickets twice a year is plenty of money. Even if one adult is a surgeon. \n\nFor 14 years, my family was in TX and for 30 years, my husband\u2019s was in MO. My husband, three children and I live in NJ. Christmas rarely involved either set of grandparents.  MO travelled to NJ 6-7 times in 30 years; one Christmas. We spent one Christmas in MO, in a hotel and went to TX for New Year\u2019s Day. TX travelled to NJ/NY 1-2 times a year for 14 years; their parents lived in NY. But I don\u2019t recall any Christmas with them here; my youngest sibling was only 4 when we moved to NJ.  (They moved to NJ when youngest was 18.)\nMy best guess is we travelled to see one set or the other every other year, on average.\n\nTwice a year is no small commitment.", ">Why would there be no magic at grandma\u2019s place?\n\nWhat if grandma is a raging narcissist that constantly tries to undermine how her daughter raises her own children, or who constantly insults her daughter in law, including in front of the grandkids, whenever her son comes to visit, or gives her grandkids inappropriate gifts (like condoms to an 11 year old boy or diet pills to a teenage girl), or does something else that makes visiting for the holidays a challenge?\n\nI'm not saying OP is, to be clear. But I don't get how it can be so hard for people to contemplate a single scenario in which maybe someone would not consider bringing their kids to their parents' house to be a great idea. There are dozens of potential reasons for why there may not be \"magic\" at a grandparent's home", "Or OP has a history of not treating Alice well for all we know. Or maybe they are all super fundamental Christians who didn't accept Alice for who she was until she had grandkids they wanted to see. Or maybe Alice is just lazy and doesn't want to put in the effort to see her immediate family and their families once a year. Who can say for certain; this family stuff gets messy and stupid real quick.", "I mean u/goblinf has explained what I mean by my comment.\n\nBut I just want to give a little bit of advice.\n\nPlease get help. I don't know if you're a teenager or a mother yourself. But you really need to understand how relationships work. It's not healthy to think like you do.", "I would never in a million years let BF finish a shift on Christmas and come home to an empty house alone.", "I would agree with you if this were the case, but she stated that she invited her entire family, but due to Vanessa\u2018s demanding work as a surgeon, she\u2019s unable to go. She then invited Alice and the kids to come up because there was no way that Vanessa was able to take off from work. For many years, my husband, who also worked in the medical field, was unable to go on family vacations with us. While I wouldn\u2019t be away from him on his birthday or Christmas, I would go beforehand or afterwards, and he would stay home to work. NAH Mom wants to see her daughter, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren. Her daughter-in-law is required to be at work and cannot go. Her daughter wants to be with her wife for the holidays. All of this is completely understandable. OP, I wouldn\u2019t push, because it may drive them further away. She wants to be with her wife, it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t want to see you, but, I completely sympathize that you want to spend time with them. Could they come up before or after the holidays when Vanessa isn\u2019t working or could you visit them in their city?", "I can go to new Zealand twice a year at off peak times, or once a year to go for Christmas. It's also a more stressful time of the year, and my sisters both have to do stuff their their partners side of the family, too. \n\nThere is nothing specifically wrong with waiting in my parents house until my siblings arrive with their kids, especially when  Christmas is for the kids anyway. But it's still non stop giving attention and there is no downtime in an already stressful (and, frankly, unenjoyable) holiday season. \n\nBut logistically and financially everyone likes me coming twice a year instead of once a year during the time we can spend the least amount of time together. \n\nEven on my husbands side, we go to family holidays where everyone stays together for a week out of obligation. If it makes others happy, that's okay. But I do get home frustrating it is to have a mother in law who demands we do things her way.", "She might? It sounds like that her daughter's family has never been \"home\" for Christmas. And OP may want a Christmas that has her whole family there with all the grandkids and spouses. She's obviously not going to get picture perfect with daughter's wife's schedule, but having daughter and her kids there would at least get all of OP's kids there. This reasoning/desire would hold true regardless of the gender of spouse.", "Both of my sisters, when they had children, stopped coming home for Christmas. The reason was that they wanted their children to have what we all had growing up, which was Christmas Eve at home, opening one gift at midnight (or more if you opened socks or some other gift you couldn't play with), and then waking up at the butt crack of dawn to run screaming into the living room to open all the rest... IN OUR OWN HOME. \n\nOP wants them to come home because she wants her tradition to continue, not realizing that maybe her kids want to their kids to grow up the way they did. Also, traveling at holiday time sucks. And honestly, once they said no, trying to guilt them into coming \"home\" was rude AF.", "We are only hearing one side of this, and I'm guessing there may be some sort of bad blood or issue that OP ignores, doesn't believe is actually her fault, or isn't aware of. For a child to go 10 years without being with their family on a holiday could indicate some sort of issue that OP isn't mentioning here. It's also possible that OP's daughter's wife chooses to work every Christmas because she gets extra pay. OP's mindset that her daughter could separate from a spouse for days surrounding a holiday seems to be a hint at something more we don't know about. If I was OP's daughter, I'd be deeply offended at my mom suggesting I leave my partner behind on a major holiday, and I'd be just as upset if my MIL was suggesting my partner leave me behind.", "So you've never known anyone in the medical field, huh?\n\nGetting enough time off at Christmas to travel that far is seriously difficult for most in the medical profession.  Also travelling by plane at Christmas is absolutely awful and stressful", "\"Refuse to believe\" all you want, but you're almost certainly wrong.  Working in a hospital, if you don't work the actual holiday, you almost definitely have to work the day before or after.", "I agree. It doesn\u2019t have to be an every year thing, but it would be nice for OP and her other kids\u2019 families to spend time with Alice and her kids every once in a while at Christmas. My sister is in a similar situation where she and her family live in the same town as her in laws, but is an 8 hour drive from our hometown. Also, my sister was a teacher and had time off during the holiday, but for a long time my BIL did not. So she would go to our hometown for 4 or 5 days and my BIL stayed at home. It usually happened every other year or so and it didn\u2019t take anything away from their family bonding experience while it did help my nieces and nephews to bond with my side of the family."]}
