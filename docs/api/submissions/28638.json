This has been so since they moved away for different reasons and we use this as a way to bond with them and for them to see each other\n\nMy sons (Jack 32M and Harry 35M) visit us every year and we have a great time together. My daughter (Alice - 31F) lives about an hour away from us by plane with her family. This includes her wife (Vanessa - 35F), and their two kids (6 year old son, 4 year old daughter). They come visit us on my husband's birthday or mine if they can. They've never been with us for the holidays since they got together 10 years ago.\n\nThe reason for this is, Vanessa is a surgeon and she always has to work, including the holidays. This year, I again invited them and Alice declined the invitation for the very same reason as every year. I suggested that the kids were now older, and maybe Alice could fly out alone with them and stay with us for a few days while Vanessa kept on with her work.\n\nAlice told me she there was no way she would spend the holidays away from her wife. I told her how her kids were missing out on the chance to spend time with their cousins and I'm sure they'd have fun if they came over. She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city. I may be an AH because I again told her it wouldn't hurt anyone if she came over just a few days, and I said I was sure Vanessa could handle that.\n\nShe got mad at me this time and said she honestly only wanted to be with Vanessa and the kids, and that they used this time to bond together as a family. She also called me pushy and selfish for not understanding where she's coming from, and said I was being unreasonable by asking her to abandon her wife during the holidays.\n\nMy husband and Jack are on my side but Harry thinks we went too far with the insisting.

I told her how her kids were missing out on the chance to spend time with their cousins and I'm sure they'd have fun if they came over. She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city. I may be an AH because I again told her it wouldn't hurt anyone if she came over just a few days, and I said I was sure Vanessa could handle that.\n\nOnce she'd already told you she wasn't going to spend the holidays away from her wife you should have either suggested a solution where she didn't have to, or you should have dropped it. Instead you continued to push for the solution that you wanted and that only benefitted you. It's disrespectful to ignore someone's \"no\" just because you don't like that they won't do the thing you want them to do.\n\nIf this is truly about just getting to see your daughter and her kids more, I'd apologize for pushing too much and ask if she is willing to brainstorm a solution for next year so that you can all spend time together and she doesn't have to leave her wife to do so (celebrating one of the holidays on a different weekend when her wife is available, you flying to her, whatever the case may be).", "It sounds like your daughter and her family make an effort to see you on your birthdays, and even a \"an hour away by plane\" with two small children *during the holiday season* is not a lot of fun.  Since \"No\" is a complete sentence, and you kept arguing with your daughter to abandon her spouse on a holiday and upset her, YTA. Sorry, Mom.", "YTA. First of all, an hour by plane is closer to 5-6 hours of travel time after dealing with all the airport BS. Secondly, you are expecting her to travel at the most expensive, unpredictable, busiest time of the year.\n\nBut mostly the issues is that you are demanding she abandon her wife over the holidays. Think of how you would feel if your husband took the kids and left you alone for Christmas. Even if you had somewhere to go, you would be heartbroken that he did that to you. You asked, and your daughter said no. She is an adult, and you need to respect that. All you are doing is driving her away.", "YTA  You got too pushy.\n\nYou don't get them for Christmas.  It's just not in the cards with Vanessa's current role/responsibilities.  If you keep pushing, you'll get fewer visits on you and husband's birthdays.\n\nAllow a story.  My grandmother (dad's mom) insisted that all 4 of her kids and her grandkids come to her on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My mom, one year, decided that she wanted to do her own turkey for lunch, invite her parents,  and swing by later to visit.  Grandma hit the roof and said impolite things.  Dad, 100x more stubborn than me, put his foot down, told her to stop being an ass, or we wouldn't come a Christmas, either.  She hit the roof again, and dad was true to his word.  We never again did either  holiday at grandma's.  Then, the other 3 kids pulled back, too.\n\nThat's your life if you keep being an asshole.", "Why don't you, Husband, your sons and their famiilies rent a place where Alice and Vanessa lives so you can spend Christmas with them?\n\nVanessa isn't at the point in her career where she gets enough time off at Christmas that travelling is practical, so you need to decide what is more important spending Christmas in your home or spending Christmas with your whole family.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYour intentions? Good. \n\nYour invitation? Good.\n\nYou refusing to accept a polite \"no\" and pushing for her to do what you demanded? Asshole.\n\nListen to your daughter and give her the basic respect she deserves. This isn't all about you.", "YTA for not understanding that your grandkids would want to spend as much of the holiday as they could with their mother, and that your daughter would want to with her wife.  Also for assuming that a 4 and 6 year old kid are \"older\" and wouldn't want a Christmas holiday at their home.   \n\n\nIf you got your way, think of how the holiday would be for Vanessa; she'd go to work, come home on a major holiday to an empty house, with her beloved wife and kids far away. That's heartbreaking.", "I get why you'd want to be with all your family for the holidays.\n\nBut *they* are also a family, and asking your daughter to split that family over the holidays \u2013 and then pushing the issue when she'd firmly said no \u2013 is really disrespectful of that.\n\nHow would it hurt nobody for Vanessa to be left at home alone, but hurt the kids not to be with their cousins? You're prioritising your wishes over theirs (ETA: Alice and Vanessa's), so YTA. \n\nOut of interest, if it was one of your sons in this situation, would you genuinely ask them to leave their wife at home and bring their kids without her for the holidays?", "Why don't you all go to Vanessa and Alice? Rent a cute Airbnb and spend time with them. I don't know why it's Alice and Vanessa who have to literally risk other people's lives (given Vanessa's career) to go see you.\n\nyes, YTA", "YTA for insisting. It's good that you invite them and let them know they are always welcome, but that you are like \"well just leave your wife at home\" is not cool. Also the kid's are still young they are going to want to be with both parents on holidays. If you are so concerned with the kids missing out on time with their cousins, maybe next year you guys can all rent an airbnb around where your daughter lives and you guys do the traveling instead.", "Why don\u2019t you leave your spouse at home and travel to Alice\u2019s for the holidays?", "YTA.  You can't expect your daughter and grandchildren to leave her wife alone during the holidays.  Holidays are already very stressful and it sounds like your daughter-in-law has an especially stressful job and your daughter wants to stay home to celebrate with her.  How could you expect your daughter to leave her home alone?\n\nIf everyone else is willing to travel to visit *you*, why can't everyone just travel to *her* to be together instead of expecting her to leave the person she loves all alone?  Your unwillingness to see her side of this and accept her reasons is pretty selfish, IMO.", "YTA. Jesus Christ she is telling you she wants to enjoy Christmas with her wife and kids. Stop bothering her and trying to push her to see you instead. You're not her nuclear family anymore, and the kids deserve to spend Christmas with their parents (both of them!). You selfishly wanting them to abandon her wife/their mom so you can have them at your house is beyond disrespectful. Leave them alone and don't ask again, else I promise you will ruin your relationship with them. \n\nYou. Are. Not. Their. Nuclear. Family. \n\nLet them be.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter clearly said no she didn't want to leave her wife for the holiday and they already have plans at home.  That is where you should have stopped. You were pushy. Stop dragging other people in to take sides. Their opinion doesn't matter in this.\n\nIt is important for a lot of busy families to spend their precious holiday moments together in a relaxed way not fighting through crowded airports as the solo parent while your spouse misses the entire holiday with your young kids. \n\nPlan a big family get together on one of your birthdays when they can manage to travel as a family instead.", "I'm going with very soft YTA.\n\nBased on what you said, you don't seem to recognize that your daughter has her own family now, setting their own traditions.  In my fam, my mom calls it \"passing the baton\".  \n\nWhat complicated things is my generation scattered to the winds.  Before that, it was all local.  My sister inherited 2 kids and quickly popped out 2 more.   She was in Texas and they set their traditions, inviting anyone who could make it.  They didn't travel for Christmas until the kids were older and my parents took early retirement in FL.  They turned it into a vacation type thing.", "YTA. Why are your holiday traditions more important than Alice and Vanessa's? \n\nYou already said that Vanessa is a surgeon, that she is constantly working and that her time off is precious, so why wouldn't you want her to have every minute she has spare to spend it with Alice and their children the way you want to with yours? \n\nI'm guessing you're a Christian so here's a reminder, Christmas is a time of goodwill to all men, try and show some to your daughter and stop trying to guilt her into doing something she doesn't want to.", "YTA and dismissive of your daughters relationship with her wife. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u201d and \u201cI was simply asking her to leave her wife alone\u201d \n\nDo you not hear yourself? I hope this is fake because otherwise you didn\u2019t actually absorb the words you wrote out and how ridiculous it sounds for you to demand your daughters attention and not understanding why she\u2019d say no.", "YTA. She\u2019s prioritizing her nuclear family which is healthy and normal. She visits you at other times. She was honest and specific in her reasoning. You just sealed her choices with your pushiness. Why not change YOUR routine? You don\u2019t have a monopoly on Christmas. My sister is also about an hour away by plane and a health care worker. The rest of us are married with various holiday obligations. My family picks a weekend in December that works for everyone to get together and have \u201cChristmas\u201d and I\u2019m so grateful that they do this instead of acting entitled to our whole day like you are.", "YTA.  You get to ask, once.  And then you have to respect the no.  Here's the thing - it's a lot of work to travel with young kids.  It's also a lot of work to travel over the holidays.  And your daughter's family is not available for holiday travel anyway.  You get to sit in your house and wait for people to come to you, while you insist that your daughter travel over the holidays by herself with two young kids, leaving her spouse alone.  That's not great!  Maybe, if you want to see all your kids at the same time, you need to plan a visit when all of them are actually available.", "YTA and your son is correct.\n\nYour daughter has her own family now and has made the decision to spend Christmas with them in their own home which is entirely reasonable. What is unreasonable is you expecting your wants to supercede hers. So accept that she will not be there for Christmas, this entails saying that you are disappointed but understand and no more follow ups about it, no begging, no dropping little hints, no passive aggressive snarky comments or you won't even get a birthday visit.", "Yes, YTA\n\nYou want to split up a family at Christmas time. They are a family.  Think how you'd feel if your husband took your kids to his family by plane during Christmas when the kids were young and left you home all alone because you had to work.\n\nVanessa isn't working every single minute. She still has time to spend with your daughter and their children.  This would be very hurtful to leave a family member by themselves just because they have to work.  \n\nYou should apologize for being thoughtless about this situation. You really weren't thinking about anyone else's wishes other than yours.  Sure it would be nice to have the whole family there for Christmas, but what about Vanessa?  Don't you even consider her feelings? Or how  much the kids will miss their mom at Christmas?", "YTA\n\nYour kids come visit \u201chome\u201d when they first move away and before they develop their own roots. \n\nOnce your kids start having kids, it\u2019s time to drop the \u201chome for the holidays\u201d mentality.  It\u2019s time for the parents to travel.  Especially when it\u2019s a family with children having to travel instead of 2 healthy, adults. \n\nMy parents lost out on a relationship with my family because they were set in their ways about their house being the only place acceptable to celebrate holidays. My brother lived 10 min away.  I was 60 minutes away, 2 children under 2 and a disability.", "YTA, you should have accepted her answer the first time she said no. Her wife won't be working 24hrs a day and will still have some time to see her children and wife and that shouldn't be taken away from her, especially with the ages of their children. \nYou need to apologise for being pushy and learn to accept that your daughter has her own family now who will always come first.", "Sorry but YTA. It sucks when people you want to see don\u2019t want to see you as much back, but nobody owns you their company, not even your child. It makes sense that they all want to be together during Christmas and that your daughter doesn\u2019t want to travel alone on plane with two small kids (when everyone else is travelling). \n\nBetter to bring up with her that you want to see them more and ask if they have any suggestions what to how. If they don\u2019t, then respect their boundaries and learn to regulate your own emotions of disappointment. It\u2019s okay to be disappointed when you were hoping for something, but it\u2019s not okay to place your disappointment on somebody else when they\u2019re just honouring their boundaries. Pushing people to see you is not the way to go if you want more of them in your life.", "YTA. It\u2019s very clear that your daughter now has her OWN family traditions around Christmas and that is to spent time with the family she has made for herself. She placed a boundary and you are continuously trying to circumvent that boundary year after year. No - she isn\u2019t going to leave her wife on Christmas just because you want to see her and the kids. If you actually wanted to make an effort? What is so difficult about going down to visit her and the family she has made for herself - not on Christmas. Make another \u201cChristmas\u201d because her wife\u2019s work constraints will not allow them to visit you.", "YTA\n\nI would never leave my spouse alone on Christmas, let alone take my young children away from them.  Only a massive AH would push this.", "Yta why don't *you* go visit them?", "YTA - she gave you the answer the first time. That\u2019s not an invitation to keep pushing. When someone says no, listen.", "YTA. Why are you allowed your Christmas tradition but they aren\u2019t?\n\nYou could travel to visit them for the holidays, but my guess is you won\u2019t. \n\nWhen my children reached middle school / junior high age we told our parents we wanted to create our own traditions. Each year, one side of the family was invited as we had always switched off holidays before that.  My MIL understood but my mother was upset. Her entire marriage she celebrated the holidays in her and my dad\u2019s home, but we were not supposed to enjoy that same privilege. \n\nThe first year she came to our home. It was nothing but passive-aggressive comments about how it didn\u2019t feel like the holidays. That was over twenty years ago and I swore I would never treat my children this way. I have enjoyed Christmas with everyone in my home, Christmas in my children\u2019s homes, and Christmas without any of my children or grandchildren. All without the need to guilt anyone over their holiday decisions.", "Maybe Alice is LC with you and you can't recognize this because you've always been dismissive of her wants and needs.\n\nAlso, YTA.", "YTA \n\nYour daughter has created a new family. Asking her to leave behind a member of her core family is not only selfish but rude.", "YTA why aren\u2019t you visiting your daughter for the holidays?  Have you ever done so?  Have you ever proposed to? I\u2019m sick of the fake nice passive aggressive bullshit mom your daughter and her family deserve much better", "YTA. \n\nThey have a job that doesn't let them travel at the holidays, and I'm grateful to them and the millions of people who have jobs that restrict how they spend the holidays for our safety and comfort. \n\nIn the last 10 years, instead of being like...oh Vanessa works, how about we see if we can all go to their location one year, you just keep expecting them to come to you. \n\nWhy would it be so hard to alternate holidays in different cities? And if one of your children didn't want to host, fine, but how about asking your daughter if she would host Christmas one year and you all come to them?", "YTA \nYour daughter is right,  you ate pushy and selfish. Your daughter wants herself and her children to spend the holidays with her wife and for the kids to be around both parents. She's married and her wife and kids are more important than you,  time to get over yourself.", "YTA - you don\u2019t *have* to celebrate Christmas in Christmas. Why haven\u2019t you in 10yrs try to hang out with the other siblings on a different day?", "INFO: why can't you host the families on another festival?", "YTA. You invited them and they declined the invitation. This is when you let it go. But instead, you wanted her to stay home alone for the holidays without her family and are throwing a hissy fit because she said no. \n\nKind of selfish of you to push what you want with every excuse you can think of so that your daughter can be alone for the holidays. She already has a highly stressful job to do, and her family time is just as precious.\n\nPick another holiday or time when she can take off and invite all those cousins so everyone can have \u201cfamily\u201d time you are so desperate for. It doesn\u2019t have to be Christmas", "YTA. Lots of people here giving you the solution. Go visit your daughter\u2019s family if you want to see them for Christmas. You really think your grandkids would want to  spend time with you and their cousins for a few days, but mommy couldn\u2019t come? They are a family and have their traditions. At what point did you stop going to your parents or in laws for the holidays?", "YTA. Your daughter has the right to spend Christmas where she wishes and you should not be pressuring her. \n\nYou say that they are only an hour away by plane. Especially if you live in a northern climate with possible snow storms over the holiday, plane travel over the busiest holiday of the year can be risky if Vanessa has to be back at a certain time. There are always delays and cancellations due to weather and traffic volume. Christmas travel can be stressful.\n\nAlice has called you pushy and selfish. Do you think that might be the real reason why she doesn't want to be with you over a holiday that can be stressful with strong personalities clashing. I remember how peaceful and pleasant our Christmas was one year when the roads were closed and we were forced to stay home. It was wonderful! I don't blame Alice for wanting that.", "So you\u2019re saying that they have had the exact same arrangement for the exact same reasons for *10 years* and you still can\u2019t drop it?\n\nYou realize that Vanessa and her side of their family matters too, right? It\u2019s not like they never see you, by your own admission they make time to come visit as a family annually.\n\nGiven how selfish and dismissive you are being about this I\u2019m surprised they come to visit you at all.\n\nYTA", "YTA i had a mother in law like you. The insistence all Christmas's had to be spent with her not my husband and children or god forbid my parents was a nightmare we opted out after 2 years, we spent christmas with each other and our children. When my children got partners I said to them all where they spent Christmas was up to them I wasn't going to guilt them into anything. We now have afternoon tea somewhere really nice between Christmas and new year and have a great time and there's no cooking cleaning or washing up!", "YTA what part of the word no do you not understand the n or the o?", "YTA for pushing, not for asking. You were fine asking and fine suggesting she come without her wife, but once she said no you crossed over in YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps you can set up a time where she would be able to come over, maybe a few weeks before or after Xmas when things are a bit calmer.", "You're not the AH for asking once, but you went over the like by pushing. You may be \"sure they'd have fun\" and you may be \"sure Vanessa could handle that\" but it's not your decision. I bet your daughter is sure her wife doesn't want to be alone for the holidays.\n\nAnd you haven't hosted all your kids for ten years. It's just your son and his family. Your daughter, her wife, and their kids have their own holiday traditions by now. Let them enjoy them.\n\nYou might also consider going to see them sometime, not at the holidays. Roads and planes go both ways.", "YTA for pushing/insisting. You offered, she said no thank you. That should have been the end of the discussion.", "YTA. As a parent, you would have taught your daughter that no means no, so I don\u2019t understand why you have forgotten what it means. \n\nIf this really is about spending more time with your daughter and her family, you will make the effort to go to them.", "Can you plan now for Christmas 2024?", "YTA", "I mean...you could always change the time you celebrate holidays to maybe work for the other family? That's what my family does because we all have other families too.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't ask, you crossed the line and demanded.", "YTA, Harry is correct. The invitation itself is not the problem. It\u2019s the insisting and guilt tripping that followed her answer that makes you the AH. If this is how it is every-time, I\u2019m not surprised they only see you twice a year.", "YTA. You\u2019re not the AH for asking, you\u2019re the AH for not respecting her answer. Your daughter is grown with a life, and she gets to decide what would \u201churt\u201d people or not. It sounds like you didn\u2019t even try to understand her position, you just wanted what you wanted and were rude and disrespectful when you didn\u2019t get your way.", "YTA. Sorry but Xmas holidays with parents trump Xmas holidays with grandparents. They are immediate family, you\u2019re just extended family.", "Your children are adults now. They have their own families. What you need to do now (and what you should\u2019ve done years ago) is celebrate the holidays with everyone together ON A DIFFERENT DAY. Say a weekend that WORKS FOR EVERYONE. \n\nThis is what we\u2019ve always done with my extended family and what my ex husband\u2019s extended family. This isn\u2019t hard. You talk/email all the relevant parties ask if you can come up with a day to celebrate together. Does December 2nd, 16th of January 6th work for everyone?\n\nYTA for expecting your daughter to conform to what you want when IT DOESN\u2019T WORK FOR HER FAMILY.", "For all the people saying \"go to them\", that's also not a thing you get to do without negotiation.  If the whole family descended on my place at Christmas when I was younger in my career, I couldn't have seen them.  And some smaller families want their own Christmases without the drama that extended family would bring.  And you cannot tell me, after this post, that this extended family does not come with drama.  Alice, Vanessa, and their kids deserve the Christmas they want.", "YTA. Families with little kids often opt to make Christmas nuclear-family only. They make precious memories that way, and it's a lot less stressful than hauling everybody through airports at the busiest time of year. Plus she wants to be supportive of her wife.", "If Vanessa has been a surgeon for 10 years, there is no way she's been oncall every one of those years, unless she volunteered to be oncall. Just, fyi.", "YTA. I don't see what you thought you'd accomplish here - if Alice were interested in or willing to visit for Christmas without her wife, she'd do so. Why would you try and 'insist' when you have zero leverage? Nobody ever enjoyed something more for being guilt-tripped into it.", "YTA for being pushy but...\n\n>She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city.\n\nSomething about this doesn't sit right with me. Do they spend every Christmas with Vanessa's family?\n\nWith the couples I know, if one of them has family in town and the other has family out of town, they take special care to alternate big holidays. It's not fair to spend them with the local family because odds are they already see more of the couple throughout the course of the year.\n\nAgain, it's completely up to your daughter and her wife where they want to spend the holidays. But it seems a little odd that they have NEVER allowed you to spend Christmas with your grandkids.", "NAH. You want to see your daughter during the holidays, but she has to do what\u2019s best for her family now. You are on thin ice though, beck cause you were being a bit pushy. YWBTA if you keep pushing.", "YTA- you can go visit her or plan a holiday get together on a different weekend or even plan a family get together at a different time of the year. Her wife shouldn\u2019t be left alone just because her schedule doesn\u2019t fit what you\u2019d like it to", "YTA. You could travel to her. You sure sound pushy. You run the risk of pushing her away completely.", "NAH....but you're close.\n\nNot knowing the context of how your positioned was delivered (suggestively, definitively, etc) it's tough to say if you were in problem-solving mode or intrusive-parent mode. Even if you were in problem-solving mode your suggestions may have come across as insensitive. Suggesting that your grandkids leave their mother behind for Christmas is a bit cold. \n\nFWIW, we have a child who lives out of state and our position has been that it's our responsibility as the parents to carry the majority of the burden related to getting together. Your kids are in their prime family-rearing and career development phases of their life. They're busy...very busy. As the parent, it's most likely that you have more flexibility and resources on hand to find the right ways to stay connected.\n\nChristmas and other holidays will always be tough for you as a parent out of state. It's just the way it is. If this is a major issue for you, get creative and find solutions that your kids can get excited about. If they're interested and excited, they'll find a way to make it work if it's within their ability to do so.", "You are NTA for asking.\n\nNo means no.\n\nYou are TA for continuing to push her boundary.", "NTA- I think you just miss your daughter and your grandchildren. Ultimately, you do need to respect her decision or you would be the asshole. Perhaps after the holidays, they could fly to you or you to them?", "I\u2019m getting low-key homophobia vibes. Like it\u2019s okay to leave her wife at home alone because it\u2019s not the same as a \u201creal\u201d marriage.\n\nI may be reading something into it that truly isn\u2019t there, but I just can\u2019t shake the idea that if one of her sons said no, OP would accept it and find a compromise. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nEither way, YTA. Hugely.", "yta - Look, your daughter is grown and has her own family obligations now. If all the cousins miss her and her kids so much, they would arrange to see them.\n\nThe more you guilt her about it, the less she will want to come visit at all.", "There are a lot of days in the year- maybe ask her and your sons to help pick a weekend when they can all gather for a family reunion.

This has been so since they moved away for different reasons and we use this as a way to bond with them and for them to see each other\n\nMy sons (Jack 32M and Harry 35M) visit us every year and we have a great time together. My daughter (Alice - 31F) lives about an hour away from us by plane with her family. This includes her wife (Vanessa - 35F), and their two kids (6 year old son, 4 year old daughter). They come visit us on my husband's birthday or mine if they can. They've never been with us for the holidays since they got together 10 years ago.\n\nThe reason for this is, Vanessa is a surgeon and she always has to work, including the holidays. This year, I again invited them and Alice declined the invitation for the very same reason as every year. I suggested that the kids were now older, and maybe Alice could fly out alone with them and stay with us for a few days while Vanessa kept on with her work.\n\nAlice told me she there was no way she would spend the holidays away from her wife. I told her how her kids were missing out on the chance to spend time with their cousins and I'm sure they'd have fun if they came over. She told me they already planned to spend time with Vanessa's family because they live in the same city. I may be an AH because I again told her it wouldn't hurt anyone if she came over just a few days, and I said I was sure Vanessa could handle that.\n\nShe got mad at me this time and said she honestly only wanted to be with Vanessa and the kids, and that they used this time to bond together as a family. She also called me pushy and selfish for not understanding where she's coming from, and said I was being unreasonable by asking her to abandon her wife during the holidays.\n\nMy husband and Jack are on my side but Harry thinks we went too far with the insisting.

Christmas was spent at our house every year. This was always my parents, their kids, my maternal grandma, my moms two brother and my paternal grandfather till he passed away. This is what my sibling and I thought was normal. \n\nAs kids do we got older and my sister eventually met her husband. He too had family traditions around the holidays. Traditions his family expected him to continue. So they spent the first year trying to do both. \n\nNot long after the first holiday my mom got brain cancer and for two years they struggled. They have every Christmas Eve to his family since that was big in theirs and every Christmas to mine. It was exhausting for them to travel so much over a short time. They never had a holiday that was just them. My mom only survived for 3 years and my dad unilaterally decided we all had to go to his sisters for Christmas. Our mom just died so we relented the first year. However this became the norm for my dad and we his children who wanted to spend time with just him was ignored. \n\nMy dad passed away a few years ago and my sister at this point became a mom.  It became difficult with a baby to deal with it all. She asked my dad if we could do a visit to them the day after. He refused and argued with us on his last Christmas. If he had survived today my sister and I would never go back. \n\nWhile your family you grew up with is family so to is the family you married into. You can\u2019t honor only one around the holidays.

Before COVID we gathered at my MIL's for New Years Eve every year because Christmas had too many complications.", "Sorry, but YTA. At Christmas, the nuclear family comes first. You are now the extended family; your daughter's children are entitled to have memories of Christmas in their own home, with both their parents. Not to mention, in case you don't know, traveling by air, with young children, at Christmas time, is a fate no one would wish on people they love. Now back off, before your daughter decides she doesn't ever want to spend time at your house.

I would imagine they'd consider making a point to come *some time.* You just don't get to decide when that is.", "And her expectation that her daughter-in-law spends her Christmas season alone? Rubbish!", "I doubt the intentions were good. Would they insist that their son abandon his wife? Homophobia is here.", "I am not sure I would suggest that. Alice may not want her pushy mother around at Christmas, interfering with their own now well established traditions.", "This. YTA is correct.", "Yes. Also, I don't understand why the kids can't see their cousins some other time of the year.", "Our family normally does this every other year. Works out great.", "On top of all this, you aren't even thinking about the kids. They are 4 and 6 - the peak of believing in the magic of Christmas.  They want to wake up on Christmas morning and see Santa came and brought them gifts. They want to open gifts from their moms and spend time as a nuclear family. \n\nYou remind me of my MIL. I have vowed to never be like my MIL. Try to do better.", "Vanessa is 35. There is almost no chance she has been a surgeon for that long.", "Even if she is not on call for Xmas, it\u2019s likely that she may be on call Xmas eve, the day after Xmas or around the holiday. \n\nEven if it\u2019s not the actual holiday, it may be close enough that it\u2019s not worth flying with young children for such a short trip.", "This. Even if she is relatively new, most surgeons rotate holiday call so that everyone eventually can be with their family  every so many years. Perhaps Vanessa is volunteering to do call because OP\u2019s daughter really doesn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas, and call is convenient excuse?", "No this is ridiculous. We only stay local on Christmas because I want my kids to enjoy their day. Christmas is the biggest deal in the world when you\u2019re small. I\u2019m not ripping my kids away from their tree and their presents and their traditions when they\u2019re young. You\u2019re welcome to come to us and we will come to you on other holidays but on this day we are not going to be traveling. And if the option was to travel without my spouse on Christmas the answer would likely be forever \u201cno\u201d.", "\"NEVER allowed you to spend Christmas with your grandkids\", really? Is there some reason OP can't go to them one year? Plan a family holiday in Alice and Vanessa's city, since they can't leave the area? It's not fair to put so much pressure on a family with young kids and demanding jobs to always be the ones to travel. Sometimes it's just not realistic.", "> Something about this doesn't sit right with me. Do they spend every Christmas with Vanessa's family?\n\nMy thoughts exactly. Either Alice just isn't as close to her family as Vanessa is to hers or...Vanessa is a little controlling.", "We did the exact same thing. Christmas is for our little family, waking up, opening presents, Santa magic, cinnamon rolls, the whole 9. We are not, under any circumstances, spending Christmas elsewhere. Our Christmas traditions are ours to cherish, and that is a boundary I will stand firm on.", "Very manipulative, isn't it?\n\nAlso, if the issue is about spending time together, why not do the holidays at Alice and Vanessa's place this year?", "Speaking of family units, I wonder if we'd still be having this discussion if Alice's wife Vanessa was her husband Van instead.", "In all fairness OP did suggest that her daughter could enjoy the stressful trip and time with OP being responsible for two kids alone.\n\n/s, obviously", "My grandparents always had 'family Christmas' at their house a week before Christmas so no one had to travel on Christmas day. On Christmas Day itself they would come to our house since we lived 5 blocks away. Worked fine for decades.", "I found that traveling on Christmas Day itself is delightfully stress free.", "I feel sorry for your husband that his entire family cares so little for him that you all abandon him over the holidays.", "Was this your husband's idea/suggestion? Cuz that's a totally different story imo. If your ILs would invite just you and the kids, that would be actively excluding someone without their input. That's rude", "Man I get that it was an agreement between you and your husband. I still can't fathom though working during the holidays and having to come back to an empty house with no one to celebrate with.", "I don't know if it's homophobia. It just sounds like plain selfishness and no considerations for their DIL.", "I have definitely seen post on this sub where people have expected exactly that. Homophobia is a thing, but so is \u201cmy son ought to value me more than his wife because I\u2019m his mother and she\u2019s just the grandchild incubator\u201d and \u201cour sons and daughters are Real Family but their spouses/our SILs and DILs are just add-ons.\u201d", "Well just like any adult conversation, it would have to be just that: a conversation.\n\nAs a married adult with two young kids, it's not super easy to travel during the winter holidays where I live to go see my parents.  It's much easier for them to hop on a plane and come see us, but they would never just say \"hey we're coming for Christmas\".  We'd talk about it first.", "Obviously a conversation should occur about it where Alice agrees... but getting young cousins together at Christmas is often quite delightful for most moms.", "Families change. Schedules change. Priorities change. You need to accept that this is the case for your daughter and help plan a time that works for her whole family.", "I think they are including residency. She most likely just started out in her attending career and so she is getting the holiday calls. I also wonder if these call are set. I take call on Thanksgiving every year so I can get Christmas off. Maybe Vanessa is doing the same for another holiday. I also wonder if Vanessa feels uncomfortable at OPs house because if Alice really wanted to go, they would have made it work.", "maybe she is not. actually on call but no one can debate that excuse? lol.", "Wait, just to understand. Why would there be no magic at grandma\u2019s place?\n\nMy parents make a massive deal out if Christmas for the kids. We could be stranded in the Sahara and there would still somehow be a tree and gifts and all the other magic.", "This is the way", "> Is there some reason OP can't go to them one year?\n\nOf course not, but that may mean foregoing Christmas with her sons (if they can't make the trip with her, and that's assuming her daughter would even want to host them all).\n\nBut if they regularly spend Christmas at Vanessa's family's place, why not make one excursion to Alice's family's place?\n\nAgain, this is assuming Alice even has a good relationship with her parents (or at least as good as what Vanessa has with hers).", "Or OP has a history of not treating Vanessa well, so they minimize contact.", "I suspect Alice and Vanessa might hurt you for that suggestion.", "They are avoiding this pushy mother \ud83e\udd23", "My guess would be no", "Totally agree. Having my MIL scream in my face \"***YOU*** aren't part of this family!\" was not fun.", "Exactly.  When I was a kid, we usually gathered at my grandparents for big holidays.  Those are the ones I remember the most and fondest, anyway.  And all of us (in this country) would travel to be there for the afternoon and evening.  \n\nBut it changed.  My cousins got older and married and had kids, adding more family to the picture.  Relatives moved and travel became more onerous.  And it all became too much for my grandparents to manage (and they've since passed).  \n\nThings change.  Some for the better and some not.  But it always changes.  I can't get another one of those childhood Christmases, no matter how much I would give for one.  OP must accept that things have changed.", "Exactly correct! I did 2 years of general surgery as my internship, then 4 years of radiology residency and a one year fellowship. Surgery is a 5 year residency plus whatever fellowship someone might need to specialize. I didn\u2019t become an attending until I was 33, and yes, holiday call is something that the more junior partners had to do more of.", "Lol, definitely another option!", "Sure there can be magic at grandmas. There can be magic at grandmas on the other 364 days of the year. On that day it\u2019s important to me that my kids get to stay home and play with their toys, wear comfy pjs, watch our favorite Christmas movies and just be a kid in their own environment with their new stuff. Our family drops in through the day as they choose. Could we make magic elsewhere? Of course. Do we want to? No.", "And here we may have a winner, folks. Went through this ***for years*** with my late mother wanting me to drop everything and spend Christmas with my brother (a whole other story) at his place. Just, no.\n\nSo, I had my boss send a department-wide email that no PTO would be granted from Thanksgiving to the end of January as we needed every minute to prepare for external audits (has the advantage of being true).\n\nForwarded the email to my mom, which shut her down. Had to repeat it every year, but at least I was spared me having to tell my mom the truth and break her heart.", "Yeap, I agree. There is a reason they are always busy during holidays lol.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Even if they aren't there is a big difference between visiting a relative's houses and hosting 6 adults + kids in YOUR house.", ">Yeap, I agree. There is a reason they are always busy during holidays lol.\n\nYeah, there's a reason the surgeon has to work EVERY Christmas, and it's what Alice told her mom when pushed - she likes spending Christmas with just her nuclear family.", "Exactly lol"]}
