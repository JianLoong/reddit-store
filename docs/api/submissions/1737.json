She's pretty so i go to talk to her. She's not interested so I move on. If i see her and we make eye contact I politely say 'hello' in passing or just knod if its appropriate.\n\nShe has been telling people that I'm stalking her. I dont know where this came from i dont even look at her. We just use the gym after work at the same time. People at the gym have followed me home and started to harass me because of this. Some people straight up are calling me a rapist because of what she is saying. Others are openly threatening to hurt me.\n\nAm i the asshole for ignoring her and giving her space when she wasn't interested?  Would I be the asshole if i called the cops to report being harassed?\n\nEdit:\n\nI've contacted the gym with the names of the people causing issues. If the woman was reacting based on bad experiences from her past i'm just going to give her plenty of space and let the gym manager tell her how fucked this was. The gym will probably speak with the member as well.

Tell the staff what is going on (ASAP, before her tall tales get you kicked out), and ask them if a) you can have a copy of the footage to save on your device, so whenever her goons come up to you, you can show them the interactions. If not, b) if they can save the footage for the police report you will be filing. Then file a police report. Get a lawyer to send her a cease and desist.\n\nShe is TA.

So, do what you need to feel safe and to make sure you stay safe.\n\nHopefully you are filing a police report about the harrassment. If they are following you from the gym, they should have surveillance that can be helpful for the police.\n\nAs for her, do you know for sure that she is the one spreading this around? I would simply go to gym management and let them know that there is a dangerous rumor being spread about you. Don't outright accuse her without proof, but let them know you suspect it may be her. From there, the gym can address it.\n\nAvoiding contact is always a good thing - so keep ignoring her. Because if people are approaching you and strangers are following you home, you are in serious danger and you need to **make as many people aware of it as possible**.\n\nGood luck to you", "NTA, tell management first thing next time you go. Tell them that you enjoy the gym and do not want to have to go look for another one, but will be left with no choice of this continues. \n\nTry to recall specific dates and see if they can pull security camera footage of the harassment.", "INFO:  I have this sneaking suspicion the initial conversation was a bit more uncomfortable for her than you thought and that has snowballed since you seem to keep looking at and acknowledging her and it's making her uncomfortable.

That is bad, illegal regardless of his actions.\n\n2) her accusations of him stalking her - did he harass her in the first place (it doesn't seem like it)\n\nFollowing up on the second point isn't victim blaming.

If they do- you can mention to gym management that they can look thru the footage which will show that you are minding your business and are not near her. Might want to also get a copy if you plan to file a harassment claim with the police. Every bit of evidence helps. They should be able to easily find the footage bec you are there at approx the same time every day. I would also be curious to see if she is doing anything when you\u2019re not paying attention (chatting with other people and pointing at you, deliberately putting herself in your way etc).

In this sub it is almost certain that the sexist commenters will vilify men and glorify women.", "Oh for fucks sake, trying to start a conversation one time *and then moving on* is not a social faux pas or bad judgement.", "Right, women *typically* don't go to the gym to be hit on. That said, it sounds like OP just had some casual conversation, she said she had a bf, and then they talked about their cats. That's about as benign as it gets, and I wouldn't necessarily think some gym rat was hitting on me from one conversation like that, but I've always been pretty clueless. \n\nI don't think her behavior now or the people harassing OP is ok. Going to the gym at the same time every day isn't stalking someone. Maybe she's uncomfortable and making assumptions, but if so, why hasn't she gone to the gym management, and why is she gossiping about this with other gym goers. Sending a bunch of knights to harass and threaten someone is way over the line. \n\nManagement is probably going to ask one of them to work out at different times, because they are usually less than useless. Op might have to find another gym, which is annoying."]}
