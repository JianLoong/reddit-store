I am someone who has always been trying to look representative. I personally like to look good and I think that coming to school with straight up a hoodie and sweatpants sitting in a corner and yawn is disrespectful towards my teachers who prepare a whole class or assignments etc. I wouldn't like my teacher to come like that sit in her chair and tell us good luck and yawn so why would I. Unlike the other girls who do always come like that. I have been in the same class for 2 years now and I am muslim. I am not practicing I don't participate with fasting, I drink alcohol I wear crop tops etc. The guys in my class have been giving me attention for 2 years and I thought I was used to it.\n\nWhen a few months ago I was in a accident and I realized how short life can be. I changed myself I have always been someone to not shut her mouth but I stopped holding back. I came in the class and a guy said \"OHHH the way I would do you\" and everyone started laughing. My teacher said something about it and I looked them deadass in the face and told them \"Is this the way you treat your mom and sister? Is this the way your parents raised your or did they completely fail as parents. I bet they would be ashamed of you if they heard you\". Everyone shut up and the teacher was even shocked because in 2 years I never said something like that. \n\nThe next day we had presentations and we had to show pics of our life. I shared some pictures with friends and concerts at a night club and you could see a cocktail on the table. I didn't think it was a big deal. At the end I asked are there questions and this girl (always annoying everyone in class agrees. Never listening while the teacher explains and then asking stupid questions). She asks me \"isn't it HARAAMMMMM to drink alcohol?\" Now this girl is a christian girl and proudly talks about how se ffcks her BF. So I told her \"I thought it was also a sin to go and F people before marriage I guess we are both sinning then\". I had to go on a talk with my teacher and she asked me why I became like this. I explained that I think life is too short to let people walk over me and especially people who I am never gonna see in my life again once I finish my study so why not put everyone in their place giving myself peace. I am wondering tho AITA for acting like this. Am I acting wrong?", "created_utc": 1697563495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a3m39/aita_for_telling_the_boys_in_my_class_straight_up/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It can be a great thing to speak up for yourself and speak up when someone is out of line, but put in the work to not tear down others for being themselves. Rude behaviors are one thing.
