I thought not showing up was super disrespectful and I distanced myself from them. \n\nSecond of all my daughter's fiancee never asked for my blessing or anything like that and I was told that my wife is not invited at the wedding so that we don't upset my ex wife (their mom). \n\nBoth my daughters have been annoyed at me for marrying Clare, for not spending enough time with them at Christmas (they are in their thirties they are not children!) and for not seeing them on weekends but still they expect me to pay for their wedding?

Not fulfilling the promise is one thing.

I'd love to hear your ex-wife's version of this, or to be able to actually see the texts you sent while still married. It's emotional cheating regardless.

You also said they wanted to spend more time at Christmas, but they aren't children. Just totally makes it seem like your mindset is that they are adults so now you're not required to hang out with them and that as children they were a hassle you had to deal with, not a joy.

Normally, yes. But first, you're marrying someone who is literally their age. That's going to be super weird to them and they're allowed to be upset about it. I don't necessarily agree that they should have refused to meet her, although that sounds like 'missing reasons' to me. You also didn't send them the first invites? Really? How disrespectful is that? They are showing you the same respect you showed them. Unless you had a very good reason for it, you're being a big hypocrite there. Then to distance yourself from them over that is petty and immature. Did you even try to hear there side of things?\n\nSecond, you say that the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask for your blessing. What century are you living in? They're grown adults, they don't nees your permission to get married. It's an outdated, sexist tradition that most people are moving away from. Also, did you ask Claire's parents for permission? If not, more hypocrisy.\n\nThey didn't invite your wife to please their mum. Wow, how awful. Obviously they should have made their actual mother figure uncomfortable for your wife that they barely know. Get over yourself. It was her wedding, your wife would make things uncomfortable, she wasn't invited. End of. You should have still been there for your daughter.\n\nLastly, did you actually refuse to spend much time with them at Christmas because they're adults?! You do know that Christmas is a time for family to come together no matter what. So you've clearly shown your daughters that they aren't family to you.
