{"id": 9957, "submission_id": "112bqr9", "title": "AITA for not letting my sister believe that she can talk to a bird?", "selftext": "My (16, M) family has a pet parrot. They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down.\n\nI've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that. \n\nThe problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like \"You know I love you right?\" and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her \"You know he doesn't understand you right\". \n\nAfter I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it.\n\nMy mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird \"reciprocated her feelings\". So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA? I think my sister is old enough to understand what I'm saying and my mom is just too nice.", "created_utc": 1676397649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112bqr9/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_believe_that_she/", "score": 6668, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s no harm in it. Listen to your sister and stop bothering her", "YTA. A ten year old is having fun and you want to stop the fun because you're worried she'll suddenly think she's in a Disney movie? So what, she's 10. Stay in your lane", "YTA- animals can pick up on peoples emotions.. pretty sure that bird thinks your AH too.\n\nBirds can and do express love through their actions, many parrots mate for life and grieve for their lost partners. It will not harm your sister at all, but you sure are.", "I asked my dog.\n\nShe says YTA.", "YTA. What did it cost to stay quiet and not be a dick? Also birds are smart- especially parrots. They can definitely form relationships/bonds with their owners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's giving \"edgy teen\" and that's okay because that's where you are in life right now- but take it from me constantly playing the cynic is not going to make you many friends, or even allow you to see the beauty and whimsy in life.", "YTA. What was the point of you saying that other than to just be an asshole? There was no reason. Bully behavior.", "YTA\nYou jealous of a parrot, dude?\nAnd yes, that bird absolutely understands your sister. No, not the words \"I love you\" in the sense that it has an understanding of \"I\" or \"you\", but in the sense that it hears those sounds and feels the affection. Seems like the bird understands love better than you.", "YTA. Why are you so mean to your little sister? No wonder the bird isn\u2019t that fond of you. Also I recommend reading about parrots and that they can indeed associate words with their meanings.", "YTA. You sound weirdly jealous of the new family pet OP. Maybe talk to someone about your feelings and quit lashing out at your sister over nothing. Who cares if the bird actually understands or not? Your sister loves the bird, and unless you think your sister is a total moron she knows it's not a magical talking cartoon animal.", "YTA - as someone who owns a parrot myself I can pretty much state that parrots do pick up emotions and can respond with the same action to certain kind of words. Meaning they do somewhat understand. \nFurthermore your sister is 10. She may be old enough to understand what you said, yet she still has a different mindset. Just let her talk to the parrot, since it won\u2019t harm any of them.", "YTA  I am 50 I talk to my dog and cat. They both recognize trigger words. Like treat. Walk. Outside. Sleep. Up. The dog quite a few more. But that doesn\u2019t even matter. She\u2019s 10. How does that hurt you in ANY way? It has nothing to do with Disney movies, it\u2019s quite natural. You do realize at that age pretend play is still normal too? Like Barbie\u2019s and dolls. And people talk to their pets all the time. You were being a bit of a bully to your sister. Do you do that often? \n\nI think it\u2019s weird if you don\u2019t talk to your pets.", "YTA - I tell my cat I love her every day. She tells me she loves me by vomiting on the tile instead of the carpet.", "YTA.\n\nOk, zoology major here.  It is entirely possible that the bird understands her, at least somewhat.  Birds in general, parrots moreso, are exceedingly smarter than most people expect.  \n\nThe key is to think of talking to most animals as talking to a foreign person.  Even if you don't understand the words, you pick up tone, subtext, etc.  And, given enough time, you will learn some of that language.  Just like I know which of my dog's barks means food versus which means play, and how I know if my cat just saw something interesting in the other room.  \n\nAlso, animals, birds included, do form emotional relationships with others, those of their own species and those of other species.  So, yeah, if your sister is nice to the bird, takes care of it, and shows it affection, it likely does reciprocate her feelings.\n\nAnd beyond that, there's no harm to letting her believe so.\n\nSo you're doubly TA.  Once for trying to crush her dreams, and again for being so wrong while doing so\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards!.", "YTA.  You remind me of my toxic sister who called me weird and stupid because I made my dolls \"talk\" to eachother.  I talk to my pets every day and that shouldn't be frowned upon.", "YTA. How do you know the bird doesn't understand her? You're not the bird. Nor are you a zoologist or even a wildlife biologist. Nope, you're just some over-opinionated teenaged AH who felt it was necessary to dampen his little sister's joy over her bond with her pet. \n\nAnimals are smart, much smarter than you so it seems. While they may not understand the exact words as we do, they understand the tone and so much more. Animals have great intuition too. Often times they provide us comfort when we need without us even so much as uttering a single word. They pick up on the nonverbals. \n\nYou need to apologize to your sister for your asinine and incorrect remarks as well as your mean spirited behavior.", "YTA. She obviously loves the bird. You are being unnecessarily mean. And come on, she\u2019s a kid. Even if she wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s a normal thing to talk to your pets. People do it all the time with cats and dogs, I see no reason why it wouldn\u2019t apply to a bird.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen any pet owner not snuggle their pet and talk and say I love you. I tell my cat I love him and talk to him throughout the day. I\u2019m 30 years old. Also, isn\u2019t it a good thing your family is still giving the parrot love and attention even though he isn\u2019t brand new anymore. I think that\u2019s what good pet owners do. \n\nSounds like you are weirdly jealous of the parrot.", "YTA. Ffs let a kid be a kid. She's 10 and you're a bad older brother. Her bond w animals could lead to a very fulfilling life of animal conservation, veterinarian, or as a field researcher or whatever.  Just because it's not your thing, don't shit on it for your little sis.", "YTA big time. Everyone talks to their pets, I have conversations with my dog all the time. I know he doesn\u2019t understands me and I would bet your sister knows the bird doesn\u2019t understand her either. It\u2019s harmless fun and you sound like a jealous asshole. You\u2019re 16 and really need to grow up by the sounds of it.", "Doesn\u2019t every pet owner talk to their pets? And pets actually understand tones of voices, the bird knows your siblings love him and they know you hate him. Yta.  You don\u2019t have to love pets. But please allow other people to have joy in their lives.", "YTA I am almost 30 and have a full on conversation with my dogs. Do they understand me? Nope. Do they care? Nope. Pets want attention so it doesn't matter as long as they feel love and cared for.", "I feel like YTA a little bit. It doesn't sound like your sister was being delusional or thinking she's in a movie. It's normal and healthy to express love and affection to pets. I tell my cat I love her all the time. \n\nMost animals can't understand what we're saying, but they can understand how we say it in our tone. Parrots are unique in that they can learn up to 100 words/phrases, what they mean, and say back to communicate. Your parrot might start saying I love you to your sister when it feels safe or wants to see her happy.", "YTA it\u2019s a sweet pet that she enjoys. If this was a real concern, you should have told your mom and let her decide because she\u2019s the parent.

Birds are pretty intelligent. You should do your research.", "YTA- let her believe that animals can understand her, it\u2019s cute and harmless. I can guarantee almost every pet owner will talk to their pet and say things like I love you. Seems like you\u2019re just being a little bit mean to your sister.", "YTA - I tell my dog and cat everyday that I love them and I would do bad things to save their lives if necessary. Do they understand? No do I care? No. Pets are family.", "Okay, I usually can\u2019t make it all the way through posts made by people under 25 on this sub, but you got me \u2014 short and sweet and well written/explained. A+ \n\nWith that said, INFO: what\u2019s your problem with this bird? Parrots are extraordinary creatures who are a lot smarter than you think. They actually can communicate with you and your family. You basically have a new sibling who is a permanent 4 year old. How are you not yet charmed by its adorable and majestic birbness?", "YTA. It's like telling a religious person there is no God. This sort of belief (in your sister's case) is not harming anyone and makes your sister feel good. Odds are the bird does understand the tone if not the words to have a sense of how your sister feels. Some birds can be as smart as dogs, but even if this bird is dumb as a brick, it really doesn't matter and is a mean-spirited thing to take this from your sister.\n\nLike telling her that Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy don't exist, it's just a jerk move to remove a small amount of joy for absolutely no reason. Justifying it by saying her friends will look down on her is just cruel, not realistic.", "YTA and kind of dumb too for assuming the parrot cannot understand. They have a capacity for speaking languages and so I assume their capacity for understanding words is even bigger. Even dogs understand up to 500 words so there\u2019s whole sentences that they are catching. The parrot likely has come to understand \u201cI love you\u201d as a affectionate phrase.", "Oh wow YTA.

You need to dial it back.", "I think you disliking animals is related to you thinking they don't understand. They absolutely do understand love and affection.

I feel like baby-talking to your pets and telling them you love them is pretty normal pet-owner stuff.  People don't do it thinking that the animal literally understands the words... they are just showing affection to the pet.  Your sister will be fine.  She will grow up to be a normal, functioning member of society like me who kisses my pets on their little heads and tells them how much I love them every day while fully understanding that they do not understand the words I am speaking to them.", "Since you decided you know better than your mom, you should get a few other things out of the way.

Even dogs and cats can understand the human language.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with talking to a beloved pet.  Your sister can talk to her parrot all she wants.

Like the majority of the comments said, it is perfectly normal to talk to pets, they may not understand exactly what you say but they usually get the idea from your tone and body language.

They're smart animals and can communicate at least in a way that seems conscious.", "YTA big time. Animals aren't just objects. They're absolutely sentient beings. They understand tone and actions just fine. \n\nI'm an adult and I talk to my cat like he's a child. He's incredibly smart and he meows at me all the time in response. He's gotten extremely more vocal over the years as well (he didn't meow at all as a kitten. He was maybe about a year old the first time I heard him meow.). Animals do respond to you talking to them, and just because YOU don't understand them, doesn't mean they don't understand you. \n\nFun fact: and you can look on YouTube for this if you don't believe me: there are push buttons now for cats so they can talk back to us. You can teach them to push these button to express simple words and phrases that these cats use all the time to express how they are feeling, and even their needs and wants. It's pretty amazing, and apparently not that hard to teach them how to express themselves. They do respond and don't just push these button willy nilly which shows they at least have the capacity to understand words and respond back in kind. \n\nRats have the emotional and intellectual intelligence of a five year old. They can understand complex sentences and commands. This has also proven with studies over the last fifty years. \n\nParrots are incredibly intelligent, and can even mimic our words back at us. They do also have been shown to carry emotions just like we do. Again, studies have proven this. Some parrots can understand and mimic up to 500 words. Your sister is doing very important socializing work with the bird. \n\nI think you need to take a step back and reflect on what the real issue is here. It seems to me that you're feeling replaced by the bird, and it's getting more attention and affection than you're getting, so you're lashing out on the most vulnerable people in the room rather than being open and honest with your feelings. You're 'kicking the cat' meaning you're misplacing the aggression you're feeling on both your sister and parrot. \n\nI understand you're sixteen, and still developing, but you are more than old enough to express yourself and your frustration than both of them. But instead you're being a bully to both of them, and that's concerning. \n\nPlease work on your communication skills and talk about what's really bothering you instead of taking it out on a ten year old.\n\nEdited: for clarity. I had to fix some of my sentences for them to make more sense.", "So here\u2019s the thing\u2026 you are actually wrong and YTA. Some animals can actually learn human words (dogs and cats for example can learn up to 250 words and 50 words, respectively). Birds soecifically don\u2019t understand the meanings of individual words BUT they can pick up the general meaning behind phrases based on the actions that are associated with those words. So if you say \u201cI love you\u201d and give it affection, the bird will learn that I love you means affection. \n\nEven if that wasn\u2019t the case\u2026 every pet owner ever has spoken to their pets. It\u2019s pretty normal for humans to anthropomorphize their animals. There\u2019s is no harm in it.

Hopefully this is just out of ignorance.\n\nMost parrots capable of mimicry can be taught to repeat a phrase, with repetition and practice. Many parrots (and other birds) engage in bonding behavior and often will be more affectionate with a given human than others.\n\nDoes a given parrot understand everything at a human level? Possibly not. The current thinking is that they're roughly equivalent to a human toddler in reasoning (and in emotional regulation). \n\nDoes the parrot recognize that a given human making a sound and being affectionate may be desirable behavior, and want to do it on its own?

They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down.\n\nI've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that. \n\nThe problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like \"You know I love you right?\" and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her \"You know he doesn't understand you right\". \n\nAfter I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it.\n\nMy mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird \"reciprocated her feelings\". So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA? I think my sister is old enough to understand what I'm saying and my mom is just too nice.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Seriously, ever.", "My favorite video is of a parrot rocking out to something like \u201cLet the bodies hit the floor.\u201d I\u2019m not a fan of metal, but apparently he is. He knew all the words.", "I'm not a bird person, but African Greys are so fascinating.", "My cat will only eat his *dry food if I feed him.  If my husband feeds him, cat comes looking for me. This hurts my husband's feelings. Cat doesn't care.\n\n(*Doesn't apply to his fresh chicken. I'm pretty sure that King Kong could feed our cat his fresh chicken, and he'd sit happily eating it.)", "Dude sounds like one of those guys that would make his girlfriend get rid of her cat because it's \"just an animal\" and doesn't believe they have feelings.", "I can assure you, my child speaks to stuffies and our menagerie of small pets. They are almost 9.5. Make believe is normal tween behavior and talking to your pets is just normal people behavior. It\u2019s baffling OP thinks sister is going to get teased for <checks notes> the same things her classmates do every day.", "Right? The kids at school will probably be jealous of his sister\u2019s cool bird!", "I mean, I'm 40 something and kiss my cats and tell them I love them as well.  OP, YTA.  What harm does it do to let your sister believe something like that?  10 year old girls grow up really fast, and I love that she's holding on to childhood and Disney for a little longer.", "My two amazons also think OP is TA, but like your cockatiel, I\u2019m not sure if they can be trusted. \n\nMy umbrella cockatoo, however, told me at approximately 115 decibels that OP is TA and she loves everybody so she can be trusted in this.", "Your tenant owns quakers?", "Depending on the species. The smarter ones can speak in context. An African grey  is the equivalent of a 3-5 year old child. Incredibly smart. Check out YouTube for Einstein the parrot.", "Absolutely! In fact, parrots learn human language the same way human toddlers do.", "they definitely can learn words, recognize and verbalize actions, and even remember the names of colours of different things and what material items are made of.  look up Apollo the African Grey on youtube as great example of all this.  and he imo is not even the smartest parrot out there.", "Yeah, they are noisy little things, and the male hates everyone but they are cute.", "Theyre not wrong, Walter.", "My neighborhood coven of cats agrees that OP is TA.", "My family had a cockatiel. When a cat joined the family, it took one instance of her sticking a paw into the cage and getting bitten for her to decide that the bird was to be respected and revered. We'd regularly come home to find that the cat had piled her toys, rolled-up pairs of socks snagged from dresser drawers, and often the kitchen sponge in front of the table in which the bird's cage sat. The cat would look at us like, \"I don't know how those all got there. That bird's magical or something. It's certainly not me paying tribute to a bird. Ha! The very thought... Oh, he says he wants more sunflower seeds. I'ma sit here and stare up at him in awe and have a conversation with him now.\"\n\nBird was dumb as a fluffy rock, but that cat knew what was what.", "I have that book!", "I had never heard of them. Looked them up-- they're beautiful parrots. Enjoy.", "No, I\u2019m a human that gives \u201cour\u201d cat food but by that I mean I give my husband\u2019s cat food, and she regards me with something in between bitter hatred and bare tolerance. She thinks this guy is TA but only because he should probably injure the bird and then let her torture it to death. I mean, I still love her and all.", "Wow this story just keeps getting better and better", "...and you're not going to give us a clue where to find this? (or a link if you are allowed to post them on this sub?)\n\nEdit: never mind, did some googling and found a video which might be it, is it the one with the parrot singing the song and mimicking the vocals exactly - including the shouted words? Agree it's pretty funny!", "Thank you. I know he will. Last time I spent time with the birds, the blue one bit me on the ear, so I am still salty at them.", "Yes! Sorry! I was lazy.  [Parrot likes metal](https://youtu.be/uguXNL93fWg)", "Yes my parents had a parrot for years. We all loved him dearly and he was very clearly intelligent. He called my Dad, \u201cGrandpa\u201d was so sweet. We definitely talked to him and believe he understood! It was crazy the first time anyone\u2019s dogs met the parrot cuz he would just suddenly talk ( and sounded very human like) and the dogs would freeze, look at him & either run off or shake in the corner!! Was hilarious \ud83e\udd23", "There's a special parrot room. Parents must be rich!", "I was expecting it to be a 4 year old and it was either going on to be ignored by the 4 year old, or ruin their fun.", "Was that bird able to use its tongue to identify different materials? I saw a documentary where the African Grey would rub it\u2019s tongue on a piece of wool and say \u201cWoollll.\u201d", "I actually appreciate your response as I learned from it. I\u2019ve had cats and dogs simultaneously and knew their food wasn\u2019t good for each other but not why. I also learned from the response about the diet being vet approved because I learned from it, too, so thank you both for this conversation.", "Now I'm laughing:) oh, I whish animals were allowed where I live."]}
