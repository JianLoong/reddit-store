She knew I was a relatively small baby and was just worried that I wasn\u2019t prepared for the reality that my children with her son were probably going to be huge.

Nothing else.", "NTA your husband can choose who will be in the room when he gives birth. This is your medical event. Fairness has zero place in this situation. It is 100% about you and the support you need. Your mom will calm and reassure you, your MIL will stress you out possibly delaying labor with risk to both your and the baby\u2019s lives. For me, it\u2019s a no brainer. Your Mom is IN and MIL is OUT.", "NTA tell your husband fair doesn\u2019t mean equal. Being stressed during labor is bad for you and the babies health. If she can\u2019t be supportive then she shouldn\u2019t be in the room. This would be my hill, if DH can\u2019t get on board then he can wait in the waiting room with her.", "Your husband needs to learn that this is not an event where you're handing out tickets. This isn't a party. \n\nYou are giving birth. And you want people in the room who will be supportive of you. Who will comfort you. And that aren't going to annoy you. \n\nThis isn't about who you love the most. It's about who meets these needs that you have at this time. \n\nYour MIL doesn't fit the bill. And it's not fair that you should be removed of some of your emotional support because she's being a b****. \n\nAnd your husband needs to realize that her feelings in this come second to your feelings in this. \n\nThe person who is delivering a person out of their body gets to make these choices. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThe rule is very clear: the one giving birth decides who is in the room.\n\nYour mother-in-law is TA by constantly trying to interfere with your decision about your labor plan.", "MIL\u2019s feelings are completely irrelevant. NTA, do what you want it\u2019s your labor", "NTA. In what world are your mom and MIL equal when it comes to access to you during an incredibly vulnerable and stressful situation?\n\nI don't even understand how this is a question. Just the idea of a MIL being in the room is strange to me.", "NTA.\n\nTell your husband that he can get on board with your program or he can wait in the waiting room with his mother. You're the one laboring and pushing the child out so you call the shots.", "NTA tell him he can have his mom at his vasectomy and you can have yours at the labour, tell him if he argues you will only have your mom and he can wait with MIL", "> If you want to deny MIL while live streaming the event to Eastern Europe just to spite her, that's your call.\n\nLovely comment. Can't upvote it enough.", "Eastern Europe: \u201c\u2026wtf who is this\u201d", "NTA\n\nI wish I had money to give this an award because you have absolutely nailed it. \n\nYour birth is your moment. You have 0 responsibility to make other people feel included or avoid upsetting them. Birth is hard, painful, and absolutely magical and anyone who cannot respect you and your choice of how to feel your own power in that moment can kick rocks.", ">Your husband is not the one giving birth \n\nYeah, the big AH of this story is not the MIL, but the husband who thinks that he is equally participating in giving birth even though he'll feel no pain, be in no danger of death, and his bloodstream and stress hormones will at no time be shared with the fetus.\n\nThe actual patient is the priority.", "Husband should probably be reminded that his presence isn\u2019t guaranteed either if the patient, ie the woman giving birth, chooses otherwise.", "Nta. Your body your choice. Whoever you want can be there and you can ask anyone to NOT be there. No questions asked.", "Yes, you do you! Granny here, and in an uncomplicated birth, babies come without doctors or other intervention. Your body knows what it's doing. Yes, there's pain; I figure that works to keep you from going out dancing while in labor. Pain management really is optional. Relax and enjoy the wonderful experience. MIL is just worried."]}
