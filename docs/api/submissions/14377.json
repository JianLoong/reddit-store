Regardless of supporting your choices, having your own mother there is probably a great comfort to you. That's YOUR mom while YOU are giving birth.

She knew I was a relatively small baby and was just worried that I wasn\u2019t prepared for the reality that my children with her son were probably going to be huge.

YTA", "YTA. MIL should mind her own business, but it\u2019s amazing to me how women get off believing they are the sole person to make these decisions. You made a mutual decision with your husband to get pregnant and raise a child together. He has just as much say in his mother being their as you do your mother.", "NTA. This reminds me of a post where a lady said her husband wanted his mom to be in the room because \"he also needed someone to support him\". The one not being in labour, the one doing nothing whatsoever. You're the one doing all the work and you are the one who needs a support system. Tell your husband that when he's the one giving birth then he can decide who's in the room and who's not.

Giving birth is a medical procedure, not a spectator sport.", "This is the way OP, literally whatever you need to feel at ease and calm when going through this. Labor and delivery is 100% you and the child you are welcoming needs. Also this concept that your mother in law and your mother are going to hold the same level of comfort in this event is a joke, I get along great with my in laws but if I\u2019m going through shit in my life I call my parents\u2026for some people of course that relationship can be even stronger depending on the history but this is obviously not one of those times either\u2026 NTA be comfortable. I promise you in the moment if she does say something you are gonna tear her head off and it\u2019ll just end up worse off on the long run.", "Yeah/ this if not an equal opportunities type event- only one of you and your husband is giving birth, so what you need to feel as comfortable as possible  goes,  and it\u2019s a worry your husband either doesn\u2019t see it that way, OR doesn\u2019t want to put you ahead of his mum, NTA,", ">She'll still be a grandma in the waiting room.\n\nOr at home. If she knows they are going to the hospital, she *will* show up and bug everybody. Just inform her when the baby is born.\n\nOne of my friends was in labor for 37 hours and family kept texting and calling whether the baby was born yet. So annoying!", "While I agree that OP is NTA, referring to childbirth as a \u201cmedical trauma\u201d is extreme and inaccurate.\n\nChildbirth only becomes traumatic in the case of complications that endanger the mother, the baby or both.", "Yes! I truly hope OP will have the delivery she wants - but there is no guarantee OP won\u2019t need some form of intervention (speaking from experience here.)\n\nMIL is undermining OP by misdirecting her own anxiety onto OP. It\u2019s only going to get worse if MIL is at the birth. It\u2019s the last thing OP needs.\n\nChildbirth is hard enough without having someone in the room who does not respect or support your wishes.

I mean even beyond it being the pregnant woman's choice, don't most women feel maybe kinda OK with their own moms seeing them naked but NOT SO MUCH THEIR HUSBANDS' MOMS?\n\nI don't think my MIL would have asked to see the birth in 100 years. I could've seen it happening if say I didn't have a mom and we'd become close and she was a mother figure to me, but as someone I met when I was 25 and have a nice friendly slightly awkward relationship with, no way. And there is NO way I'm going to try & insert myself into the delivery room of whatever woman my son may marry.", "Exactly, there\u2019s an expectant mother about to give birth. She needs support, love, and most importantly, at the very top of the \u201cmajor f*cks given\u201d list, a person who will advocate for her wants and her safety while she is going through this most vulnerable event in her life. Which, at this point of husband showing his divided loyalty, might mean OP\u2019s mom joining her in the room and husband waiting outside. Because if he\u2019s going to nag about his mom\u2019s feelings he\u2019s not being supportive, loving, or advocating for OP.\n\nMIL\u2019s feelings about not being included are a low priority on the \u201cdon\u2019t give a f*ck about that\u201d list.", "Perfect", "**Me tomorrow:** \"Yes, hi Doc.

Where I am, nobody but the husband and maybe a doula or a private midwife and medical personnel attends. Anybody else cannot even get access to the hospital, you cannot even visit unless you\u2019re like the president or prime minister (and there\u2019s been a very rare quintuple birth or something). Absolutely none of the MIL or the mother business, because it\u2019s never been a thing, ever. Hell, even fathers were barred just 30 years ago and mothers spent the first 7 days completely locked up inside and the fathers didn\u2019t even see their babies until they were a week old and the mothers were released home with them (THAT I don\u2019t find so nice). \n\nAll I\u2019m saying\u2026 the \u201chalf a family in the room as you push a watermelon sized item out of a lemon sized hole\u201d - that\u2019s not the norm. It doesn\u2019t have to be the norm. It\u2019s all up to the pregnant person to decide and everybody else can go and take a hike.", "I love my MIL dearly, she is a wonderful, wonderful person.
