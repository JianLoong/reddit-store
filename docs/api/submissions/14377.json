Regardless of supporting your choices, having your own mother there is probably a great comfort to you. That's YOUR mom while YOU are giving birth.

She knew I was a relatively small baby and was just worried that I wasn\u2019t prepared for the reality that my children with her son were probably going to be huge.

The mother may be naked or half undressed; they may be using the bathroom or the bath or any of the various items in the room to ease and progress their labour - no labouring person should be forced to be exposed more as they as already are and with hospitals and changing staff, women are already exposed to having lots of different people seeing them. \n\nThe focus is also on getting the baby out safely, the mother through the process safely and to get both of them home as soon as possible. Other people around- except the husband or doula or private midwife - are going to be distressing the mother, possibly causing delays in the birthing process and should something happen that needs a quick medical intervention, these people would be in the way and would panic and cause then problems with the mother and baby too, who could get affected by their stress. \n\nAnd anyway - the mother and baby often go home the next day or the day after, when everything is okay and the baby has had its first feed/mother has had the milk come in; or even if it hasn\u2019t, unless there is a medical need, the mothers and babies that have a normal non-complicated delivery are not kept in the hospital longer than 1-2 days after the birth. The mothers recover better in their own familiar environment and the stress of the hospital and surrounding other birthing mothers is extra on the new mom and baby; plus again - hospitals are loud. If you go home already the next day or the day after that, there is NO need for anybody to come to the hospital, because anybody who wants to see the baby can then come and visit you at home. \n\nBut that\u2019s not usually happening before the mother says it\u2019s okay. Sometimes people - including the baby\u2019s own grandparents - don\u2019t see the baby yet for a few weeks because the new family needs time to get adjusted and the parents need to get used to having a third person, who has wacky sleep schedule. Some people do invite their parents over asap to get the first look over and done with, but I\u2019ve also heard of cases where people wait until they name the baby and then people start coming (you have 30 days to register the name officially). Generally, it\u2019s considered (very) rude to come over when not invited, even if you are the grandparent or great-grandparent of the baby.\n\nEdit: oh, and the fathers thing used to be like that because it was the norm at the time. When the labour began, you entered the hospital and pretty much everybody said goodbye to you for a week minimum. Again, nobody but the staff was allowed into the hospital, but the extra was that all the babies and mothers were separated post-birth as well and only brought out for feeding time (that was before the 90s). When you had a birth, you could maybe show the baby to your husband from the window until released. The nurses and doctors were absolutely the top of hierarchy and the mothers and babies ranked pretty low in the totem pole of the hospital hierarchy back then (again, pre-90s). Then we pretty quickly switched over to the current model, where the focus is on the health and care and primacy of mother and the baby. The rule for little to no visitor remains because the hospital isn\u2019t a hotel, although everything else is now different. And nobody complains, people like it - mothers can rest in the hospital without being worried about someone forcing their way into their hospital room or coming over to annoy them uninvited (like it could happen at home).", "And like, did you want that? I did ring my mom and text a few friends about how much I loved them after Pitocin, but as the hours went on, I can\u2019t say I was in a very sociable mood.", "Followed a bit further out by \u201cWhy are the birth rates dropping?\u201d", "You are probably going to get downvoted to hell but thanks for fighting the good fight against ignorance.\n\nThese people will praise the mother for choosing her plan, her comfort over the safety of herself and her child. But would be horrified if that same mother put the infant in a car without a car seat, which is actually LESS risky then taking advantage of modern medicine.", "I\u2019m not American. OP didn\u2019t state where they live either.\n\nYou can research statistics for your country yourself. I\u2019m speaking from professional experience.\n\nI don\u2019t view patients as statistics, I view them as human beings. One mother or baby lost is one too many. \n\nChildbirth carried a terrifyingly high mortality rate prior to modern medicine. Women had no choice but to give birth at home. They had no access to a 21st-century hospital and died because of it.\n\nWhen hospital births became the norm, both maternal and neonatal mortality plummeted. That\u2019s not a coincidence.\n\nNatural childbirth is romanticised by people who\u2019ve had the luxury of never experiencing or witnessing a delivery go terribly wrong. \n\nRejecting modern medicine is ignorant and dangerous. It is selfish to unnecessarily put your unborn child at risk.", "OP uses the spelling \"center,\" which is what made me think she may be in the US.\n\nIn the US, birthing centers aren't a rejection of medical intervention, many are affiliated with hospitals and provide interventions when appropriate. There's no problem with planning a natural birth as long as you accommodate medical interventions when needed.\n\nOP isn't doing anything wrong."]}
