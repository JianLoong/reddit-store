He has me (16m) from his marriage to my mom which ended because he cheated on her with his now wife.\n\nThe affair was found out when I was 7 and my mom left him straight after. I split time with both of them unfortunately, which meant I was around my father and his wife a lot and she tried to be a second mom to me which I think was shitty after she knowingly slept with a married man (she was dating his best friend at the time too).\n\nMy mom died when I was 12. Then I had to live with my father and his wife and had no escape from them. They tried to make me forgive them/let go of what happened and they did a bunch of therapy with me. But I always told him I would stop speaking to him as soon as I turn 18.\n\nThey found out 3 years ago that they could not have kids together and almost 2 years ago started the process to adopt a baby from foster care. During the process I was interviewed. This was in February of this year. I was asked questions about my relationship with \"my parents\" which I corrected and told them she was not my parent and he was only because of blood. Then asked how I would feel about a sibling and I told them I would have nothing to do with one and was planning to move and never speak to my father again once I turn 18. The social worker looked kinda alarmed by that. She asked me about my father's family and I said they disowned him after he cheated and so did all of his friends.\n\nSoon after the interviews were done they were rejected and told they could not provide a suitable environment for a child. \n\nMy father's wife fell apart. I heard her say mom must have been cursing her from beyond the grave. She's really religious and does believe people can send good or bad luck from beyond the grave. She's still not over the news and a few weeks ago my father was telling me I should take pity on her and at least be friendly to her. I asked why I'd do that and he said her dream of motherhood is over. I told him I didn't care. He asked me if I had something to do with that. I shrugged. He then went off on me saying it was cruel to punish them this long. He said they could have provided a child with so much love and it was wrong to say things that got in the way of that. She sobbed for a week when he told her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697636908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ar8xs/aita_for_potentially_being_the_reason_my_father/", "score": 2482, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This might make me TA because I'm planning to be gone in a couple of years anyway so maybe I should have just lied and said some nice things. I can't lie that I was actively thinking about them getting rejected based on what I was saying during the interview. They already had so few to talk and I feel like the fact the kid who lived with them was so unsupportive probably went a long way.

Yes, your answers were a part of what made the social worker decide these two people have already failed as parents. Which they clearly have, look at the results. You've been living with them exclusively for 4 years and there were, what, 5 years of you spending a lot of time with them before then. If in that time they, two grown adults, didn't manage to smooth things out and give you reasons to love them, trust them, or at least want to keep in contact with them after you turn 18, there's no guarantee they would do better with an adopted child. \n\nAnswering the questions truthfully doesn't make you the reason this happened. You simply delivered the information.\n\nI'm sorry that your childhood and teenage years turned out like this. While I don't discount the possibility that you're contributing to the difficulties in your relationship with your father and his wife, you've been a child all this time and they're the adults in this situation. I hope that you'll be able to have a good adult life in the future and that you'll find an environment where you'll feel genuinely loved and accepted.", "NTA. You weren't the reason. The social worker was the one who made the call, based on the cheating, which they probably lied about. Idk what her criteria was, and I doubt that having cheated on someone years ago actually makes you unfit to be a parent, but... They cheated. That's a thing they did. This, apparently, is one of the consequences.", "NTA you were honest. You did the right thing because there is a lot of people that should not be foster parents.

I\u2019m not sure if one affair and its consequences are grounds for being ineligible for foster care, but hey, he made your life miserable so how can we say he won\u2019t do it again?

Like others have said, your interview wouldn't have had a significant impact on their decision unless you mentioned abuse and neglect.

Sure, go NC with him if you want, and I'm sure you'll get lots of support from other late teenagers and early 20 somethings on reddit who see the word \"cheater\" and think burning at the stake is justified, but that isn't the real world, and you'll probably see that as you grow up.\n\nBtw while your comments to the social worker likely were the reason for not approving it,  it probably isn't for the reason you think - it was probably because of how hostile YOU were.

It's not all on you. \n\nYour father and his wife want a scapegoat instead of looking inward and taking accountability.

You mentioned they tried to make them forgive you, put you in therapy, etc.  But....

He has me (16m) from his marriage to my mom which ended because he cheated on her with his now wife.\n\nThe affair was found out when I was 7 and my mom left him straight after. I split time with both of them unfortunately, which meant I was around my father and his wife a lot and she tried to be a second mom to me which I think was shitty after she knowingly slept with a married man (she was dating his best friend at the time too).\n\nMy mom died when I was 12. Then I had to live with my father and his wife and had no escape from them. They tried to make me forgive them/let go of what happened and they did a bunch of therapy with me. But I always told him I would stop speaking to him as soon as I turn 18.\n\nThey found out 3 years ago that they could not have kids together and almost 2 years ago started the process to adopt a baby from foster care. During the process I was interviewed. This was in February of this year. I was asked questions about my relationship with \"my parents\" which I corrected and told them she was not my parent and he was only because of blood. Then asked how I would feel about a sibling and I told them I would have nothing to do with one and was planning to move and never speak to my father again once I turn 18. The social worker looked kinda alarmed by that. She asked me about my father's family and I said they disowned him after he cheated and so did all of his friends.\n\nSoon after the interviews were done they were rejected and told they could not provide a suitable environment for a child. \n\nMy father's wife fell apart. I heard her say mom must have been cursing her from beyond the grave. She's really religious and does believe people can send good or bad luck from beyond the grave. She's still not over the news and a few weeks ago my father was telling me I should take pity on her and at least be friendly to her. I asked why I'd do that and he said her dream of motherhood is over. I told him I didn't care. He asked me if I had something to do with that. I shrugged. He then went off on me saying it was cruel to punish them this long. He said they could have provided a child with so much love and it was wrong to say things that got in the way of that. She sobbed for a week when he told her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not arguing with that at all", "This isn't necessarily the case in infant adoptions, though, which makes me wonder if maybe OP's dad and his wife were trying to go the infant adoption route-- which is fairly common for people who can't conceive. Infant adoptions are MUCH harder because there are much fewer adoptable infants and more parents wanting to adopt infants. Even if you're approved, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars and take years. Adopting older children is much easier because there are way more older children in need of adoption than there are parents wanting to adopt them, and older children have much more in the way of support needs when adopted due to being old enough to have experienced more trauma. \n\nSo, the state can afford to be choosy when it comes to infant adoptions. Which means that it's likely not OP's testimony that would have stopped them, but instead their lack of a support system and the very worrying factor of them not having any close friends for years.\n\nIt's definitely more odd that they would reject them as potential foster parents, though. The standards for foster parents are WAY less strict, which hints that something must be *really* wrong for them to be rejected even for that. A single teenager's testimony would hardly be enough to prevent them from fostering; there simply must have been other issues.\n\nEDIT: OP [mentioned in another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ar8xs/aita_for_potentially_being_the_reason_my_father/k5et8dt/) that apparently dad's wife wanted to go the foster-to-adopt route, and \"She wanted a kid who loved her and would call her mom more than anything.\" THAT'S probably why they were rejected-- the ultimate goal of fostering is usually reunification, and foster-to-adopt parents have to be ready to accept that the \"adopt\" part may not ultimately happen. Sounds like she wasn't able to accept that.", "Important to note that a lot of adoption agencies are privately run and religious, and they will keep children out of homes that don't fit their religious views. Normally that impacts same sex or unmarried couples, but I do wonder if a history of adultery might affect things.", "I can see that. I guess I was thinking that they might look at it as imagine the trauma of being in foster care, finding a family, but then they die and end up back in the system and the concern that it could happen. But I don't really know. I just figured that stuff would be important but I get why that stuff might not matter so much.", "I mean I would wonder about the long term marriage. You both already had affairs, so when is this ticking time bomb you call a marriage going to explode because one of you steps out. And you want to trusted with a child who's life will be blown up when you have another affair. Like sure kids deserve stability, but I don't think people who can't even accomplish don't have an affair are emotionally capable of providing that", "This has been my experience too. One of my siblings and his (second) wife adopted a sibling group from foster care, and he also has grown kids who have moved out and aren't around. The caseworker had to contact the grown kids, but said that there was abuse or negligence allegations that them not like the parent/step parent was not going to stop the process.", "Is this really true for healthy adoptable babies?\n\nI always understood that there are tons of older kids who need homes but that it's quite difficult to adopt an infant.", "I love that perspective. People need to be reminded that adoption is/should be about the child's needs above all, not the other way around.

Infant foster-to-adopt is a LOT of work, and the kids often have medical issues. I have a friend who did foster-to-adopt with her kids, all as infants. One they have had since she (daughter) left the NICU. It still took two years to finalize the adoption, and during all that time she was constantly going to specialists, going to court, going to therapy, meeting with the social worker.... It was incredibly draining and without a big support network, they would have never been able to do it. Their other kids came to them around 6-10 months old, and they still all do a lot of family therapy. Of their 4 kids, only one doesn't have any form of disability.\n\nETA: NTA. Your honesty probably didn't affect the outcome too much,  and it was important for the social worker to know.", "CPS isn't a free adoption agency. Reunification is almost always the primary goal.
