He has me (16m) from his marriage to my mom which ended because he cheated on her with his now wife.\n\nThe affair was found out when I was 7 and my mom left him straight after. I split time with both of them unfortunately, which meant I was around my father and his wife a lot and she tried to be a second mom to me which I think was shitty after she knowingly slept with a married man (she was dating his best friend at the time too).\n\nMy mom died when I was 12. Then I had to live with my father and his wife and had no escape from them. They tried to make me forgive them/let go of what happened and they did a bunch of therapy with me. But I always told him I would stop speaking to him as soon as I turn 18.\n\nThey found out 3 years ago that they could not have kids together and almost 2 years ago started the process to adopt a baby from foster care. During the process I was interviewed. This was in February of this year. I was asked questions about my relationship with \"my parents\" which I corrected and told them she was not my parent and he was only because of blood. Then asked how I would feel about a sibling and I told them I would have nothing to do with one and was planning to move and never speak to my father again once I turn 18. The social worker looked kinda alarmed by that. She asked me about my father's family and I said they disowned him after he cheated and so did all of his friends.\n\nSoon after the interviews were done they were rejected and told they could not provide a suitable environment for a child. \n\nMy father's wife fell apart. I heard her say mom must have been cursing her from beyond the grave. She's really religious and does believe people can send good or bad luck from beyond the grave. She's still not over the news and a few weeks ago my father was telling me I should take pity on her and at least be friendly to her. I asked why I'd do that and he said her dream of motherhood is over. I told him I didn't care. He asked me if I had something to do with that. I shrugged. He then went off on me saying it was cruel to punish them this long. He said they could have provided a child with so much love and it was wrong to say things that got in the way of that. She sobbed for a week when he told her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697636908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ar8xs/aita_for_potentially_being_the_reason_my_father/", "score": 6530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This might make me TA because I'm planning to be gone in a couple of years anyway so maybe I should have just lied and said some nice things. I can't lie that I was actively thinking about them getting rejected based on what I was saying during the interview. They already had so few to talk and I feel like the fact the kid who lived with them was so unsupportive probably went a long way.

Yes, your answers were a part of what made the social worker decide these two people have already failed as parents. Which they clearly have, look at the results. You've been living with them exclusively for 4 years and there were, what, 5 years of you spending a lot of time with them before then. If in that time they, two grown adults, didn't manage to smooth things out and give you reasons to love them, trust them, or at least want to keep in contact with them after you turn 18, there's no guarantee they would do better with an adopted child. \n\nAnswering the questions truthfully doesn't make you the reason this happened. You simply delivered the information.\n\nI'm sorry that your childhood and teenage years turned out like this. While I don't discount the possibility that you're contributing to the difficulties in your relationship with your father and his wife, you've been a child all this time and they're the adults in this situation. I hope that you'll be able to have a good adult life in the future and that you'll find an environment where you'll feel genuinely loved and accepted.", "NTA. You weren't the reason. The social worker was the one who made the call, based on the cheating, which they probably lied about.

This, apparently, is one of the consequences.", "NTA you were honest. You did the right thing because there is a lot of people that should not be foster parents.

I\u2019m not sure if one affair and its consequences are grounds for being ineligible for foster care, but hey, he made your life miserable so how can we say he won\u2019t do it again?

Like others have said, your interview wouldn't have had a significant impact on their decision unless you mentioned abuse and neglect.

Sure, go NC with him if you want, and I'm sure you'll get lots of support from other late teenagers and early 20 somethings on reddit who see the word \"cheater\" and think burning at the stake is justified, but that isn't the real world, and you'll probably see that as you grow up.\n\nBtw while your comments to the social worker likely were the reason for not approving it,  it probably isn't for the reason you think - it was probably because of how hostile YOU were.

You mentioned they tried to make them forgive you, put you in therapy, etc.  But....

He has me (16m) from his marriage to my mom which ended because he cheated on her with his now wife.\n\nThe affair was found out when I was 7 and my mom left him straight after. I split time with both of them unfortunately, which meant I was around my father and his wife a lot and she tried to be a second mom to me which I think was shitty after she knowingly slept with a married man (she was dating his best friend at the time too).\n\nMy mom died when I was 12. Then I had to live with my father and his wife and had no escape from them. They tried to make me forgive them/let go of what happened and they did a bunch of therapy with me. But I always told him I would stop speaking to him as soon as I turn 18.\n\nThey found out 3 years ago that they could not have kids together and almost 2 years ago started the process to adopt a baby from foster care. During the process I was interviewed. This was in February of this year. I was asked questions about my relationship with \"my parents\" which I corrected and told them she was not my parent and he was only because of blood. Then asked how I would feel about a sibling and I told them I would have nothing to do with one and was planning to move and never speak to my father again once I turn 18. The social worker looked kinda alarmed by that. She asked me about my father's family and I said they disowned him after he cheated and so did all of his friends.\n\nSoon after the interviews were done they were rejected and told they could not provide a suitable environment for a child. \n\nMy father's wife fell apart. I heard her say mom must have been cursing her from beyond the grave. She's really religious and does believe people can send good or bad luck from beyond the grave. She's still not over the news and a few weeks ago my father was telling me I should take pity on her and at least be friendly to her. I asked why I'd do that and he said her dream of motherhood is over. I told him I didn't care. He asked me if I had something to do with that. I shrugged. He then went off on me saying it was cruel to punish them this long. He said they could have provided a child with so much love and it was wrong to say things that got in the way of that. She sobbed for a week when he told her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dad's wife continued the relationship that tore up OP's family, even after she knew OP's father was married.\n4.

Parents who cannot meet their existing kids' emotional needs (ignoring how upset you both were but proceeding anyway, apparently without seeking any kind of therapy) should not be trusted with the emotional needs of additional kids who are going to need a lot of stability and support and might be acting out a lot. \n\nMy parents would threaten to foster or adopt kids (yes, it was actually made as a threat) just to \"show us\" (me and sister) how \"selfish\" or whatever we were and I'm sure I would've reacted the same way you did.  Our parents pretty much neglected our emotional (and in my case mental and physical health) needs, and throwing more kids into the mix only meant it would get worse for us, plus we'd have to care for the kids since my parents were so busy. \n\nHow can placing kids against the wishes of existing kids be considered a good idea? If the parents had a good and healthy relationship with their existing kids, they would've addressed all of their kids' fears and reservations respectfully, and depending on the outcome, would've either nixed the idea or gone for it, with all members on board.

And the age of the child they wish to adopt. If it's a newborn it can take years to be approved but a child 5 and up months and not even many.  The problem is that the social worker doesn't decide that and usually presumes the shortest time and the shortest time is about 4 months meaning over a year of an angry and emotionally unwell teen. No social worker  would have under normal circumstances approved that", "he left his wife, not his family. No one should be forced to stay in a marriage just because of children.

They're not looking at foster children because they want to be safe spaces, they're looking at foster children as an opportunity.\n\nThat gets really tricky, because agencies want potential FPs to understand and value that a child may be returned to the biological parent, we don't want to risk FPs engaging in alienation against biological parents in the hopes of adopting. We don't want to deal with FPs who get upset when kids mention things like missing their parents.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns regarding adopting from foster care. outside of home safety concerns, that the worker will consider is the prospective parents empathy for the trauma and separation a child has experienced, and the ability realistic expectations and goals, and I'm gonna take a guess your \"parents,\" didn't meet that mark.  Like just imagine if in their interview they spoke about what a close family you were, how she stepped in as your mother etc... and then you're interviewed and say that you don't view her as a parent, and you guys are not close at all. The alarm bells would be ringing about their inability to manage healthy expectations.\n\nAlso there are so many kids who need homes and when we get families like this it makes it so much harder because, now we have a home that is certified and ready to go but they don't want older kids, they only want babies, or they only want kids who can be adopted, it's becomes a waste of time and resources on our part, where kids can't be placed despite having so many open homes.
