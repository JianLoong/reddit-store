We have known each other practically our whole lives and we got together toward the end of high school and married when we were in college. Our son was born a year later. We were young (21) but I really thought we would be together always. I adored her and I picked up and moved because she wanted to follow her parents and sister to another state. I worked while she stayed home with our son, Robin. Then four years ago, I thought we were expecting our second child together and I came home to find her with another guy. They were talking about their baby and she was saying how excited she was to see his little girl. She told me during the divorce that she was telling him that so he would stay and she knew her daughter was really mine. DNA proved otherwise and I rejected any parental responsibility for her daughter. Because we were legally married and the actual father was gone, it was tricky to get the courts to sever the automatic parental rights. But they did. Emma even put me on the birth certificate. Thankfully that was erased when I was freed from responsibility toward Emma's daughter.\n\nEmma tried so many times to get me back. I have told her each and every time that I would never look at her and feel love again. I told her the best thing for her to do is find someone else and leave me alone.\n\nWe share custody of Robin and he has struggled with everything that's happened. I found a therapist for him when we were going through the divorce and they check in with each other from time to time. Robin had questions that I did my best to answer with a therapist. Questions like will we ever get back together (me and Emma), is Emma's daughter mine and why isn't Emma's daughter mine since he was told she was before the affair was discovered and after as a way for Emma to try and make me take her daughter on.\n\nI pay child support for Robin. I also send him over with clothes and stuff I buy for him because Emma cannot afford to clothe him well and a judge has said that does not matter in terms of custody. Emma has tried to get me to send more unisex clothes with Robin so she can use them for her daughter eventually too. I refused. She also asked me to buy some girly toys. Or to buy gifts for Robin to give his sister.\n\nShe broke down in front of me a few days ago when we left a meeting with Robin's school and she told me she's struggling and her daughter is growing up seeing her brother have so much more than her and she feels guilty but she needs my help. She said I'm the only person who could/would help. I called her greedy while she was pleading and told her if she wanted stuff for her daughter then she better chase after her baby daddy and leave me alone because I will never be responsible for her child. She started yelling at me and I walked away. That night she sent me a dozen messages saying I was spiteful toward a child and it made me more of an asshole than her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698507204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ig8u3/aita_for_calling_my_ex_greedy_and_telling_her_to/", "score": 1677, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your resources are for YOUR child.  Let her daddy take care of her.\n\nSucks for the daughter I know, but when she gets older she can ask mommy the uncomfortable questions. \n\nDo NOT get guilted into buying anything for the daughter, you do it even one time you\u2019ll never have a moments peace as you\u2019ll constantly be expected to keep doing it.", "NTA She is the creator of her and her daughter's problems.

It's not you but her father who needs to be there for her.\n\nYour ex is latching onto you because you step up and take responsibility for your son.

You should get an attorney because she is undoubtedly taking it out on your son.", "Should you send stuff for your neighbours' kids or is it spiteful not to?

She *does* seem comfortable with deceit.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your responsibility....", "OP remind her that actions have consequences. She should be going after the baby daddy if she needs money. She can probably get a court order to force him to take a DNA test to prove he's the father.

That's her mom, and dad's fault not yours. \n\nI would do a pat test for the son too, but that is admittedly because I am a petty spiteful person.

She's just struggling and desperate, which makes people act that way.  And she feels entitled to your money because she's desperate.  Now, that said, don't be a spiteful AH and buy your son ONLY boyish toys and clothes.\n\nLots of kids grow up in a blended household where the half-siblings have different financial situations.

It showed basic courtesy to the children and was healthier for the sibs' relationship.\n\nHe was my ex for some good reasons, but the kindness to children was one of the reasons he became my husband in the first place.", "NTA. All the standard truisms apply: FAFO. Actions have consequences. You made your bed (and screwed another man in it). Now you have to sleep in it.", "NTA.

But they did. Emma even put me on the birth certificate.\n\nYeah of course she did, but damn you got lucky. I honestly stand by the Australian system really. If you're to accept a system that requires someone to be paying child support than the system should clearly outline pathways out for those who've been defrauded. Whether or not this leaves a child unsupported is, in my opinion, irrelevant to justice. That should be a concern for the courts and the cheating mother.\n\n>She started yelling at me and I walked away. That night she sent me a dozen messages saying I was spiteful toward a child and it made me more of an asshole than her.\n\nYou're not spiteful towards a child, and any claims to the contrary are emotional manipulation.\n\nWhat you are is defensive, and rightfully so. The courts of America have a long and very sordid history of uncritically slapping some convenient rube with child support whether or not the child was his or even in his care. Horror stories of sperm donors whose friends sued for support because of financial decline or the death of their spouse, temporary care givers who helped a single mother down on her luck receiving a legal notice from that woman's lawyer, and so on. If even half these stories are 100% true it's reason enough for the average dude to be very, very, **very** careful about how much support they offer a \"desperate mother.\"\n\nHelping her daughter may be as good as accepting that your ex will come at you legally at some point.\n\nIf people don't like it they can hate the game, not the player.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Definitely not your responsibility,  and if she can't support her children she needs to do something to fix the situation other than guilt you into supporting her", "NTA", "NTA. She literally fucked around and found out. Her refusal or inability to hold her lover accountable for their child is not your responsibility, and the way she wants to use you and manipulate you just proves she still doesn't care about all the pain she caused you and your son. You are right not to play any kind of role besides being a coparent to your son, and you don't have to have these conversations with her. Co parenting apps are a great way to cut out this BS and keep all communication strictly about *your* child. She already had you as a husband and a provider and she decided she wanted something and someone else. You and your son deserved better.", "What an entitled a hole!

Can't they help her?", "This is just straight out manipulation.  Your ex is still an awful person.  Tell your ex that if it is such a bother to actually provide for the daughter that she had with someone else, you will be happy to take full custody of your son and lessen her responsibilities.  These are the sort of issues that arise with blended families.  It is her job to manage expectations for the other child.  Yes the child is innocent and has less stuff than her brother.  That does not make it your responsibility to fill the void.\n\nNTA", "She's manipulating and harassing you. When she goes off topic end the conversation. When she sends multiple unwanted communications, file a harassment complaint with the police.\n\nShe made this mess. It's not yours to clean up or fix.", "NTA she should of kept her legs shut. Not your kid not your problem.", "NTA\n\nWhy isn\u2019t her family helping her out? What did they think of the cheating and divorce?", "Your ex should pursue her daughter's father for child support. Limit your interaction with her. If she \"broke down\" in front of you, I hope it was in a parking lot at a neutral space you've chosen to hand Robin off to each other. You should not be hanging out with her socially; it only gives her hope that the ATM (you) will start spitting out money like it did when you were together. Tell her not to message you and reiterate that you are over her and do not want to speak to her unless necessary regarding your son.", "NTA. \n\nYour ex chose to have an affair with another man, got pregnant with his child and had you not found out by catching them it would have been likely you\u2019d now be raising and/or be paying support for both children. \n\nYes the baby she had is certainly innocent of all the mess but the baby is the responsibility of your ex and the baby\u2019s father.  She should be seeing what if any legal ways she has to chase that man to ground and get child support. In the US I think that includes garnishing his wages, getting any federal income taxes tagged and whatever other means. Maybe placing liens against property?  \n\nMaybe she should move in with her parents if they would allow it to cut her expenses.\n\nThe response when your ex cries about not having sufficient funds to raise both children might be to give you full or primary custody of your son and you won\u2019t request she pay child support as she will have reduced visitation with your son.  Otherwise her monetary troubles are hers to deal with.  \n\nIs it sad yes but she made her bed based on her crappy decisions so now she can lay in it.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all Emma is an all too common type: The Parasite. She sees people as a means to an end and for her survival means having others support her. This is not only clear in the fact that she wants you back only for financial reasons, but in that she chased her parents across the country as well. \n\nAt 32, she should be fully independent and self sufficient. \n\nThe girl is not your baby and the paternity should properly be paid by the biological father. Even the court disavowed you of responsibility. \n\nHowever, what makes it tricky is that your actual, bio son is still in HER house. So the struggling is impacting him too. This should be grounds for you to fight for more permanent custody. Get Robin out of that poverty and away from the influence of his gold-digging, user mother.", "NTA\nI can understand where she ist coming Fron. But you are not the right persone to ask for stuff or money for her daughter. She should ask the baby daddy. Shouldn't HE pay child support? \n\nDoes your ex have a job?", "To be honest I am surprised the judge let you off of the automatic assignment of parenthood for her daughter, in many places the judge doesn't care if it's not yours.\n\nHow did you manage to get that terminated?

If she wanted you to support her and take care of her and be in her life, she shouldn't have gone and spread her legs for anything with a pulse that walked by.  \n\n\nCheaters are worthless and will never get any sympathy from me. It's not a 'it just happened' thing, there is a series of active choices that lead to cheating, at any point of which they could have chosen to stop and did not. They chose to meet up with that person. They chose to have those drinks with them. They chose to go home with them, they chose to take their clothes off, they chose to get in bed with them.  \n\n\nShe made her bed and pulled a deadbeat into it.

I'm glad that you were able to escape responsibility, the courts don't always see things that way.", "Nta. You are not being spiteful towards a child. You are being spiteful towards her, and deservedly so. The child is not suffering because of you. The child is suffering because she hasn't gone after the baby daddy for support.  That is on her.\n\nThe thing is, your child could be suffering too. She obviously uses the money for food, and to keep the house afloat. Your money is not likely going straight to your boy. \n\nShe knows who the baby daddy is. If he ran off, it may be to your benefit to help her find him. She may need help navigating the court systems, specially if he skipped states. With the internet, it would probably be easy to find him. \n\nI know you don't owe her that, and she doesn't deserve your help. But like it or not, you are coparenting. If she isn't in a place financially to give him what he needs, it should concern you. \n\nYou should let her know she has options besides coming to you for money, but do it while not full on arguing.  If you were trying to be helpful instead of spiteful (again, you have the right to be spiteful, it just doesn't help your son here).\n\n\"You know I am concerned that you make ends meet, and I was serious when I said you should go after him for child support. He left you to raise his kid and doesn't even help pay. If you can't  find him, I can help you look for him. I can even help you find representation for the case. What I can't  do is give you money to help raise the affair baby. That brings back bad memories. But I can help you if you are trying to make our son's home a more stable place\".\n\nYou know, that kind of sentiment spoken calmly may be a first step on you both respecting the fact that even betrayed and divorced, you are raising this kid together. \n\nOf course, this would be very generous on your part. But it is an investment in your relationship with your son. And he is what is ultimately important when it comes down to it. \n\nAgain, you have the right to be as spiteful as you want. Can't deny you that! It just isn't helpful to your son's  current situation at his mother's home.", "NTA\n\nBut think about having your kid more with you than her as she will poison him against you!", "NTA. \n\nAt most if you really wanted you could tone down the things you send back with your son as to not push a wedge between the siblings at their mother's home.

Siblings often share. That said, I get not wanting to go out of your way to ensure that something is shareable, because your focus is your son.

We have known each other practically our whole lives and we got together toward the end of high school and married when we were in college. Our son was born a year later. We were young (21) but I really thought we would be together always. I adored her and I picked up and moved because she wanted to follow her parents and sister to another state. I worked while she stayed home with our son, Robin. Then four years ago, I thought we were expecting our second child together and I came home to find her with another guy. They were talking about their baby and she was saying how excited she was to see his little girl. She told me during the divorce that she was telling him that so he would stay and she knew her daughter was really mine. DNA proved otherwise and I rejected any parental responsibility for her daughter. Because we were legally married and the actual father was gone, it was tricky to get the courts to sever the automatic parental rights. But they did. Emma even put me on the birth certificate. Thankfully that was erased when I was freed from responsibility toward Emma's daughter.\n\nEmma tried so many times to get me back. I have told her each and every time that I would never look at her and feel love again. I told her the best thing for her to do is find someone else and leave me alone.\n\nWe share custody of Robin and he has struggled with everything that's happened. I found a therapist for him when we were going through the divorce and they check in with each other from time to time. Robin had questions that I did my best to answer with a therapist. Questions like will we ever get back together (me and Emma), is Emma's daughter mine and why isn't Emma's daughter mine since he was told she was before the affair was discovered and after as a way for Emma to try and make me take her daughter on.\n\nI pay child support for Robin. I also send him over with clothes and stuff I buy for him because Emma cannot afford to clothe him well and a judge has said that does not matter in terms of custody. Emma has tried to get me to send more unisex clothes with Robin so she can use them for her daughter eventually too. I refused. She also asked me to buy some girly toys. Or to buy gifts for Robin to give his sister.\n\nShe broke down in front of me a few days ago when we left a meeting with Robin's school and she told me she's struggling and her daughter is growing up seeing her brother have so much more than her and she feels guilty but she needs my help. She said I'm the only person who could/would help. I called her greedy while she was pleading and told her if she wanted stuff for her daughter then she better chase after her baby daddy and leave me alone because I will never be responsible for her child. She started yelling at me and I walked away. That night she sent me a dozen messages saying I was spiteful toward a child and it made me more of an asshole than her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "She can hit him for child support should she choose", "[removed]", "NTA, and I'll probably get downvoted to hell, but the only person getting \"punished\" is the innocent daughter, please reconsider the request of unisex clothes (or maybe out of every 5 items, one will be uni). Robin can still benefit from their use primarily, so he only benefits from this arrangement. And they can still be masculine leaning, and mom can purchase and hand sew on a few flowers from the dollar store when baby girl can wear them.\n\nThis just eases tension in the home. I say this because this seems ripe for a bad dynamic, even unintentionally, where your ex resents Robin or starts treating the baby girl a lot better to make up for her lack material support from that kid's dad. This is **100% the ramifications of the ex's own actions**, but there are two kids now, one of them yours, who may continue to reap the consequences. Growing up, feelings of superiority/inferiority may rise from the children, and it will sew further discord in the family dynamic. I have seen the sibling relationship sour too often over issues such as these when there are no grandparents/others to paint the appearance of equality. And falling out with your sibling, one of the few people who will see the world from most of your perspective, is worse than losing a parent for many. **None of this is really your issue or problem to fix**, but it involves your son and contributes to keeping a stable environment for him.  *I also say this bc you said you cant get custody*, bc you should do that to circumvent this whole issue if you can.  *If* you can comfortably afford it, just think about whether you could break on that one issue alone. Otherwise, goodluck to everyone involved, there is not one enviable position here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

It's not her fault that she's struggling, it's yours for not just doing what she wants. \n\nShe also wants you to absolve her of her guilt and shame. If you play daddy to her daughter, then she didn't destroy her family, and what she did isn't that bad. \n\nThis needs to be a conversation. You are not responsible for her child or her choices. She got herself into this situation. She caused this mess. She broke up her family because she decided to have an affair. The person who owes her daughter is her affair partner, not you. He is responsible for her daughter, not you. She isn't owed a family or forgiveness.", "Be strict. \nKeep buying things for your son. Be vigilant, she might start manipulating your son into making request on behalf of her daughter.", "I would Watch out for Mom to be telling her Daughter you are Dad.  It\u2019s\nMy guess that this is her plan as she has never gone after baby daddy for things.", "nta. if there\u2019s even a chance you can get her to not tell her daughter you\u2019re her dad, it is worth fighting for. by which i mean not agreeing to help her with her daughter, correcting her when she tells your son she is your daughter, not agreeing to spend time with her daughter. basically it sounds to me like you are doing the best you can for yourself, your son, and her daughter already. clear strong boundaries are the best chance that kid has to not grow up with delusions formed by her mom. \n\n(of course i hope telling her daughter that was never in the cards, but tbh from the post it sounds iffy.)", "You mean like if you just interact more with her little girl you'll fall in love with the idea of being a family again?", "That episode was wild and that woman needs a psychiatrist", "I was hooked on those, too. The one where the older mother had a face like fury because her adult daughter had the UTTER GALL to question who her (the daughter's) father was. After years and years of asking the question, the mother kept saying \"None of your business!\" etc. And it came out in Paternity Court that the man who was told he was the daughter's father in fact wasn't, and the mother told her daughter, \"I will never forgive you for this.\" \n\nLike - WHAT?!", "Record conversations in public places- pretty sure that counts", "Thank God for that at least.", "I agree. The news article I read pointed this out and I think now they are able to get a restricted license that allows travel to and from work.", "In my state, since driving is a privilege and not a right, we suspend licenses too. But we give them a license to ONLY visit the kids, drive them to school, go to work, and doctors appointments. And if they do not follow those rules then the license gets indefinitely taken until support is paid off.", "NTA. Never mind your monkeys or circus. Cheating was your ex's decision, not yours. She is required to bear the repercussions of her deeds. It would seem wiser to pursue the baby daddy rather than having him harass you.\n\nThe judge's intransigence about custody is quite unfortunate. It makes more sense to give you custody of Robyn and relieve your ex of the financial strain.", "Right. Girls can wear pretty much any clothing boys wear. If she\u2019s that desperate, she\u2019d keep any clothes that Robin wore for her younger kid regardless of what gender they are marketed towards.", "OP said it was so daughter could wear them as hand me downs as she ages.", "I calculate the son as 7 and the daughter is 3.", "It\u2019s also possible she was sleeping with more than one guy when she was cheating, and the other guy knows. He may not be baby daddy either.", "I wonder if it's possible to officially have an intermediary to do the transfers of his son so he doesn't actually have to directly deal with his ex. I've heard about couples who ended that badly that they always had a third party do pick ups or drop offs. It's an option OP might want to pursue as his ex seems hell bent on making him daddy to AP kid. That or he's gotta get REALLY MEAN with his rebuffs...like real emotional damage level mean", "Wouldn\u2019t that be a terrible thing\ud83d\ude12", "No. He means, \"Give my ex-wife an inch and she'll take a mile.\" It's pretty evident, and not him avoiding the emotional aspect of interacting with a child who isn't his.", "That is not proof of taking it out on our son. She has never expressed anything like that to me and neither has my son, to me or the therapist.", "Unfortunately as long as there's no abuse, being poor isn't an excuse to lose custody...otherwise anyone in the lower tax bracket would lose their kids. It's an unfortunate situation...but as everyone said, it's not OPs circus and his ex needs to frigging track down the actual father and sue him for child support. SHE cheated and even tried to force her now ex to father her affair partners baby. Jesus, she even put his name down on the birth certificate EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PROVEN BY DNA he's not the dad. I wouldn't feel even one iota of guilt telling a woman like that to pound sand. NTA", "Wow. Just because the ex wife is awful in this story, you're going to go ahead and claim the parent with the most money should get full custody for no other reason than money? Yikes. Lower income parent are still parents.", "That\u2019s not how it works or is supposed to work. Otherwise people will be punished for poverty.", "My super femme 9 year old daughter wears a lot of her 12 year old brother's clothes", "I don't see a 3-year old comparing what she has with what het 7-year old brother has .... I like your math, so probably Mum is making things up to get more ...", "Either way, definitely gonna be waaay too big on daughter", "I calculated the son being 11 since they had him at 21", "Was thinking the exact same thing! I mean what if she tries and he isn't her baby daddy? She'd look even trashier to OP and I'd imagine to other people around her and she REALLY doesn't want that!", "My second husband had this option. They had to meet in a neutral location.", "Here\u2019s the problem kids are not dumb. They hear conversations hear her talking about how awful you are things like that. Over the years it will take a toll on your child.\n\nI guess at this point all you can do is just tell your child how much you love him you care about him and he is the only thing in your life that is important.", "Her actions and requests to you make it seem more like you're the single parent (in fairness, you seem to care more for the kid.). Proof of incapability to support a child is what I meant", "But, not very good parents.\n\nShe let her young son, think that her daughter is his father's child.\n\nShe tried to entrap OP into having to pay child support by listing him as the daughter's father.\n\nShe continues to bother OP to pay for the daughter he did not father.\n\nShe screams at OP in public when he refuses once again to support her daughter.\n\nWhat about this woman says she is a good mother?", "Actually it's more like 11 and 7. Robin was born when OP was 21, now 32, and ex's daughter was about 4 years after Robin so around 7. So roughly about when ex's daughter is becoming aware of things like Robin having nicer and better things than her and why does Robin have a dad.\n\nNot saying it's remotely OP's problem but 11/7 is a lot different than 7/3", "The clothes weren\u2019t meant for now, but as she grows older.", "That\u2019s because she\u2019s a b@tch, not because she\u2019s poor. Income is not character.", "Four years ago .... makes the girl 3. 11 and 3 ???", "But they were married for 8 years and OP divorced her over the pregnancy with Emma's daughter. Since they had Robin when they were 21 and OP is 32 now, he's around 11, depending on birthdate, and daughter would be 3.\n\nSo. Either OP is really over-egging the story by saying that the daughter is asking questions about lifestyle and that Emma's asking for more unisex/feminine clothing and toys or the whole story is a wind-up."]}
