{"id": 11999, "submission_id": "11o9k7p", "title": "AITA for going nuclear on a house guest", "selftext": "So I (31F) and my fianc\u00e9 (35M) just moved into a new build apartment together. I will say now I have some strong scent aversions, particularly to cigarettes. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin, Dave (41M) recently moved to our town but for some reason couldn\u2019t move into his new house until the 15th so he asked if he could stay with us. Dave is a smoker. I originally wanted to say no because I know how persistent cigarette odor is but my fianc\u00e9 convinced me to let him stay. I agreed with the caveat that Dave cannot, under any circumstances, smoke in the apartment. Everyone agreed and I thought it would be fine. \n\nWeather around here for the last few days has been dreadful and Dave goes out to smoke a couple of times a day so he had been asking if he could smoke with the patio doors open and I said no. Today the weather was awful, cold and rainy, and as I was driving up to our apartment I thought I would see Dave smoking out front but instead I saw the patio doors open. I was immediately suspicious so I went up to our door and the smell hit me before I even got into the house. Dave was sitting on the couch, smoking, with all the windows open and a fan on (I guess to try and hide the smell). \n\nI lost my shit. Didn\u2019t even give him time to put the cigarette out, I just started screaming at him. I called him an \u201cinconsiderate slob\u201d and a \u201cfilthy smokestack\u201d and a few more things that were worse. I was just screaming. Dave was panicking and put his cigarette out (in an ashtray thank god) and he was just trying to calm me down but I did not stop screaming. I told (well yelled) him to get his shit and to get the heck out of my apartment. I kept screaming until a neighbor showed up to see what was going on. I just grabbed my laptop and purse and left the apartment. I called my fianc\u00e9 at work and told (not very calmly) him what Dave had done and that I wasn\u2019t coming back until the apartment no longer smelled like a cheap casino. \n\nI am currently staying at a friend\u2019s place. My fianc\u00e9 called a little while ago and said Dave had left and that it didn\u2019t smell that bad and to just come home. I told him not until the smell is entirely gone.\n\nI guess Dave told my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family what happened because my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom called and, while she agreed what Dave did was wrong that I was totally out of line exploding at him like that and kicking him out. The rest of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family (at least those with my number) have been texting me telling me I am an ass because of my reaction.  Now that I\u2019ve had some time to calm down and am away from the situation I do feel kinda bad but he did break my number one rule.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for going nuclear on a house guest?\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all for your feedback. I haven\u2019t reached out to Dave yet but apparently he left out some details when relaying the story to his family that has now been corrected and most of them have apologized for attacking me. My fianc\u00e9 has arranged for carpet cleaners to come by tomorrow and is looking in to getting an ozone machine running for a few days. As for my reaction, yes in hindsight it was way over the top. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled as much as I did. I will be reaching out to the neighbor to apologize. For those of y\u2019all who think I am completely unhinged I am in therapy and will probably be discussing this at the next session.

You violated your own boundaries right out of the gate for the sake of someone else. Something you weren't required to do. You did so with specific rules and expectations which all parties agreed to. He then violated the dog shit out of those rules and your personal space. He knew what he was doing was wrong as evidenced by all the open windows and the fan.

And smoking, in particular, is a particularly odious habit that affects everyone around the smoker (and to which some smokers are either completely nose blind to or just don't care).

I\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t have to have everything professionally cleaned so you feel like you can live at home and Dave is a huge AH for crying to his mommy about getting yelled at. Your fianc\u00e9 is an AH for not keeping his family in check. How you run your house isn\u2019t their business and they can invite that nasty habit into their homes.

Why in the world would anyone think they could smoke cigarettes in the apartment of someone who doesn't smoke, and who has explicitly said no smoking in the house while staying with them rent-free? (I do smoke btw, so i'm not on team 'cigarettes are gross')", "NTA. You had one rule and he stomped all over it. \n\nQuestion- how is your fiance responding now? Your inlaws are being Dave's flying monkeys and that sucks, but if fiance is also on board with them, you have a far bigger problem than a smoke smell.", "NTA.\nI've been smoking nearly my whole life and this is honestly the most disrespectful type of behavior.

It was no big deal. I never smoked when I went to visit family back when I was a smoker. When I got to my mid-30s, I just realized it was a dumb habit and I didn't enjoy it anymore, so I stopped altogether. It wasn't a big deal. I just stopped smoking. He really shouldn't be smoking at all while he lives with you guys. I mean, unless he's suicidal or something. That was why I took up smoking again in my later 20s after having quit for several years.

He's so extremely in the wrong here.\n\nBut you're a whole ass adult and you were screaming so much and for so long that the neighbours got involved? That's unhinged. Kicking him out is totally reasonable. Calling him gross and inconsiderate and anything else you felt like is pretty understandable.

That is such a red flag, I\u2019d not want her home for a while so I can consider what happens if I ever trigger her some other accidentally.

If he was disregarding your request the entire time, I could understand the meltdown. Screaming and kicking him out for one time is ridiculous. It was shitty weather. You could technically cut a little slack. You could have even said, \" Look,  I know the weather is shitty, but I asked you not to smoke in my place. I can't stand the smell it makes me sick.

That is *likely* what the family is reacting to.  If you can find it in you - should you ever be in a similar situation - to handle it more maturely, the actions of kicking Dave out when he violated your boundaries shouldn\u2019t be so dramatic.  It doesn\u2019t sound like anything positive was accomplished that couldn\u2019t be accomplished maturely.  \n\nDrama begets drama and if you react like this towards a house guest, they probably have genuine concerns re: your fianc\u00e9 and your dealing with him maturely.

Let him get a hotel, which will probably be non-smoking and they will probably charge his card extra after he leaves as a penalty. Screaming at him upon entering your house I totally get, and demanding he leave - but the \u201ckept screaming until the neighbors came\u201d part - you do need to work on anger management, or if it keeps happening, fianc\u00e9 is going to see that as a red flag.

The problem is the smell, it means you have to replace EVERYTHING, and how do you replace the walls? I would not move back until your finance paid to have the apartment professionally cleaned by one of those companies that specialized in fire damage, etc. Like, walls scoured and stripped before repainting. New carpet, new couch, new curtains. And frankly you'll be lucky if you're not in trouble with the landlord/realty company. Who knows how many cigarettes Dave had before you came home and caught him? A fan is nonsense, that does nothing. I understand that it is an addiction.

At best, it doesn\u2019t really express anything but the fact that you have trouble communicating and managing anger. At worst, it is bullying and abusive. Furthermore, it reduces the likelihood that the person being screamed at will (1) actually hear your message because their defenses and/or emotional arousal will rise and (2) reduces the likelihood that they will feel any remorse because they might focus on your behavior rather than theirs. I suggest you work on managing your anger if this is relatively frequent behavior on your part. One aspect of managing anger is understanding what else you are feeling (I suspect you felt the hurt of being ignored, betrayed, and/or taken advantage of) and the second is communication.   \n\n\nDave is an AH for intentionally violating your rule and for his deceitful behavior.", "NTA and I would suggest NEVER letting another member of his family stay with you.", "ES", "From OP\u2019s post history, it sounds like FMIL already has a past of stupid opinions (like telling OP that her job is just a \u201cside gig\u201d and that she should do more than 50% of the housework just because it\u2019s not a 9-5).

She had every right to be furious, I would even say she earned a good opening shout, but again based on her own description she was an AH though for losing her shit to that degree.

This family is toxic\" situation as so many people like to jump to, I do think OP needs to sit down with just fiance and talk about it. He needs to be on her side on this. I don't think this is a minor issue. Especially if she is smell sensitive. \n\nI have friends who smoke and they know they can't smoke while they are over here, period. I don't want the smell drug back in to my home and sticking to my stuff. I've never had an issue with such a simple rule. OP was generous by letting him stay period with the way he will smell and her smell sensitivity.", "I meant to say this^^^. Unfortunately, this is completely true EVEN THOUGH YOUR POINTS WERE RIGHT.", "AFAIK, Dave is still walking around, free of holes and, apparently, free of any conscience about his appalling behavior. He got away with it!", "Who was OP deceiving? Have we heard yet that she's being evicted for her yelling?", "They could have been evicted.", "yeah nah unless you're literally being murdered or something, yelling so hard that the neighbours get terrified is completely unhinged behaviour", "If I were the fianc\u00e9 and his family, I would be worried too. That was an insane reaction by her, especially at her age.", "Thanks stranger who doesn't know anything about me.", "Absolutely horrifying.", "I suggest getting a steam cleaner and steaming the walls. You'll have to replace the carpet but (lolol) if there was a smoker there you need to anyway.", "I was born as WW2 ended, so I grew up in the heyday of the tobacco industry. When I was a little kid, all the men and most of the women smoked.\n\nBut not my mother! She quit when she got pregnant (her sisters didn't). One grandmother had smoked, the other never did. My one surviving grandfather had already given it up because cancer. But the smell of tobacco was everywhere---along with lighters, ashtrays, and tiny round burns on furniture.\n\nMy dad was handsome and always beautifully dressed...but ugh, his breath. When I was fifteen we left the farm and moved into the village, so my dad got a new office in the house. \n\nFast forward 29 years---when Daddy died of COPD---and imagine the smell of that office. The entire room was painted every third year. They finally gave up on keeping the woodwork and ceiling white; the woodwork was painted deep blue and the ceiling a cream color. They gave up on curtains and used shutters on those windows instead. The windows were kept open whenever possible. But still the stink of tobacco was deep in the wood and plaster when my dad died. All the furniture had to be tossed.\n\nIf you allow a smoker into your life, this scenario is what's coming through the door.\n\nAnd we're not even discussing the health issues. It's a horrible addiction, and gradually being smothered to death by COPD is a grim way to die.\n\nBut when I look back, what stands out most is the casual expectation smokers have that they can treat your lungs and your home the crappy way they treat themselves. OMG, the ARROGANCE of it! We nonsmokers MUST draw lines wherever we can, and after nearly eighty years of battling Big Tobacco, nonsmokers finally control the clean air in our offices, schools, hospitals and other public places.\n\nSo it's people like OP who are left fighting this battle. In your shoes, OP, I would have kicked Dave out. Literally with a boot on his behind. He lied and he abused your hospitality in the worst way, leaving dirt and a stink behind you won't be able to scrub away. The people who are giving you a hard time, OP, are telling you that you and your health don't matter. They're telling you that someone else's addiction has more rights in your own home than you do. There's nothing outrageous about how you behaved in the face of someone using you like that. Anyone who thinks differently is entitled to have Dave move in tomorrow, for good.", "Is that what that is??? God dammit, I thought I was going nuts. Repainted everything and still get those, previous people living here must have smoked!", "Omg I used to do that too! I'd put my hair in a bun, cover it with a plastic shopping bag, put on a work jacket, and wear rubber gloves. The smell gets into the skin on your fingers otherwise.", "This. Her reaction wasn\u2019t the best by any means, but it really does sound like she was sitting at max stress levels as he was consistently pestering her to let him smoke with the doors open, and then to walk in on this which probably also caused a sensory overload would\u2019ve pushed her over the edge.", "Seriously! How can people be so up in arms about her screaming when they literally could've lost their home and been blacklisted from renting elsewhere due to the actions of a guy she didn't even want in her home??? I'd scream at him too! Do you people not know how frustrating it is to constantly feel like a crazy person because your wishes are never considered? I get that in this case she's choosing a fiance that isn't listening to her, but still.. screaming at someone that could cost you your home and credit seems justified!", "I don't think you meant to respond to my comment.", "Yep-they literally just moved into this place, and there's a good chance cousin put them at risk of fines or eviction.  I'd be pretty hot over this as well.\n\nI'd also apologize to neighbor and potentially leave them a fruit basket or something, but I still completely understand OP's reaction.", "Their neighbors COULD have been subjected to his smoke as well. We're not told. It's possible that his one violation didn't seep into the neighboring apartments. Dave clearly didn't give a shit whether that happened or not.\n\nThe stink will still be there long after the echoes of OP's rage have died. Dave remains a far, far greater AH for his PREMEDITATED behavior.", "No problem, stranger who vocalized they would respond the same as a person who wrote a story of them acting completely unhinged.", "Sometimes, when a customer would ship a computer to our shop for repair, we open the box and the smell pours out and infects the whole shop! Even as a (now former) smoker I thought that was pretty gross. And yes, the inside would reveal the same yellowish buildup that the walls of the room get.", "Does enough time with an Ozone generator work? I know all the fabrics and stuff have to just be trashed, but don\u2019t know how deep it can get in drywall", "I'm guessing you live somewhere that bathrooms are largely tiled and have floor drains. I'm guessing the poster above is in the US, where we have no floor drains and no expectation that anything outside the bath/shower is going to be sprayed with water, so probably paint over drywall, with wood trim and possibly flooring that isn't waterproof depending on how recently it was built or renovated. It would basically be like power washing your bedroom.", ">it really does sound like she was sitting at max stress levels\n\nthat's not really an excuse to behave like a lunatic", "TBH, if her reaction was only against Dave, I'd be OK with this, but her screaming probably bothered everyone in the building. As I said in a different comment, I'd file a noise complaint against her if I were her neighbor.\n\nAnd I hate cigarettes more than she does. Your \"aversion\" is not an excuse to bother everyone in the building by screaming like a banshee.", "It dovetails with the \"my house my rules\" mantra, too.\n\n> \"You're an asshole\"\n> \n> But it's my house!\n> \n> \"Ok, you're an asshole, with a house.\"", "Grooooss. I've seen some of those game console tear downs from smokers and they're always full of gross sticky lint and hair.", "I've heard it works but you also have to get rid of all the soft materials/fabrics AND, AFAIK, still use TSP on the walls and paint. Had a tenant that lied, said they smoked outside only. Nope, they smoked in the garage. Did all that work including ozone and still could smell smoke in the garage 4 years after that tenant moved when selling the house. So I'm not sure ozone is a long term solution.  It truly is one good way to destroy house value.", "Ok if it\u2019s able to be smelt in a garage 4 years later, that shit aint coming out. Tear down to the studs or burn it down.", "Probably would have been better to replace all the drywall in the garage. The garage was attached to the house :)", "It was illegally parked AND UP ON THE SIDEWALK.", "A sane person inconveniences themselves that one time and goes back to find a different route. Or apologizes after causing property damage. But go and yell into the void.", "NTA from a smoker", "NTA in the slightest. You had 1 rule for him to stay there. He asked about the open door thing and you said no. He KNEW what he was doing. He KNEW the answers to any questions he asked himself before smoking inside your place. \n\nAlso, it's an apartment. Depending on the contract you signed, you could be in serious trouble for smoking inside. \n\nEverybody getting on your ass can shush. Let THEM keep the smokestack in their house until his place is available.", "NTA. You had a very clear boundary that he disregarded", "Nta if ur renting this could affect ur deposit etc . He's the worst . Fuck dave", "I learnt this the hard way:\n\nNever, ever, let a smoker move in on the premise that they'll smoke outside.\n\nOutside soon becomes leaning out of the window, becomes smoking inside, and your whole house will stink.\n\nI used to houseshare, and I had to explicitly put 'STRICTLY NO SMOKING OR SMOKERS' in an ad for a new person, and even then, smokers would turn up, promising they were giving up, etc.\n\nI holiday let part of my current house, and I still receive bookings from smokers, even when I use the same wording. It's a nightmare whenever that happens as I have to wash all soft furnishings and the smell takes at least a fortnight to dissipate, which affects any guests after them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but you seem to be proud of your out of control anger\u2026", "NTA", "ESH. Pretty sure David's family is contacting you not because you got upset & kicked him out (which is reasonable, he did break your one rule), but because you screamed at him for a significant amount of time & still hadn't calmed down by the time you called your fiance. That's some unhinged behavior, & I would be worried for any family member who was engaged to someone that's ok with screaming like that just because they're upset.", "NTA. He agreed not to smoke inside.  You are justified in asking him to leave.  He can\u2019t be trusted to follow your expectations.  However, you may want to work on not having an emotional outburst in this type of situation.  You could have just told him to move out and left out the name calling.", "ESH - Dave absolutely deserved to be told to leave, that was unacceptable behaviour. But your reaction was only appropriate for a situation where someone was in immediate and serious danger.\n\nFor your own sake, it seems like it would be wise to work on your temper and learn some distress tolerance skills. That level of anger isn\u2019t healthy, for your mind or for your body.", "NTA you did the right thing by kicking him out. he broke the rules. as for your in-laws tell them if they are that bothered you kicked him out then they can take him in and what goes on in your house is none of there business", "NTA - your one real rule for allowing him to stay and reinforced several times was broken.  He knew how much you did not want any smoking occurring in your home.  He even made it worse by not being right next to a window but sitting on your couch.  \n\nThat means it will be awhile until the smell is completely out.  You really should have him pay to professionally clean your couch and anything else that the smoke would adhere to.(curtains and carpet)\n\nAlso make sure fen is fianc\u00e9 has not given him permission since the weather is so bad.", "Honestly the only thing that 'could' have been done better is if you would have calmly walked in and calmly told Dave to get the eff out of your house.  You are NTA.  Consider a NO smoking wedding, which includes the outside of the venue property.  My cousin did this for the sole purpose of keeping her brothers from chain smoking outside the doors.  They had to walk about 50 yards through a gate and cross the road to a sidewalk.  They ended up leaving around 9p after about 3 trips to smoke.  Both told her it was the worst wedding ever.  She simply replied, for YOU maybe, but not for ME.", "NTA :\n\nHe won\u2019t have any troubles smoking on the street!\n\nHope that cigarette was worth it for him.", "NTA obviously. Tell your fianc\u00e9's family that they can go screw themselves. You were crystal clear on the rules and this guy agreed to them then blatantly broke them. \n\nI really hate the smell of smoke as well. Idk if I would've exploded quite that way but honestly I completely get why you would.", "NTA.  I was a smoker for a brief period of time and I never smoked indoors, and always stood away from other people unless they wanted to stand/sit near me.  Most people hate the smell of cigarettes and it sticks to everything.  After I quit smoking, it took months for the smell to fade from my favorite jacket.\n\nAlso, I have a sister who smokes in my parent's house, although they've told her multiple times not to.  It doesn't matter if they don't like the no smoking rule, it's not their home.", "NTA I'm a smoker and I would never smoke in someone else's house even if they said it would be ok", "Nta. I quit a year ago. Smoking kills as does second hand smoke and it sits in fabrics and clothes and literally stains walls. The smell will never entirely go away until you wipe down every single surface. I suggest lysol air and fabric spray for things you can't wash. He's extremely disrespectful for what he did after you already told him not to and knowing it kills people is just saying he will risk your life and health because he doesn't care at all", "NTA.  He played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.  Dave was solely the AH.  Anyone who gives you crap should be reconsidered for the wedding guest list.  Really  ... what did he think would happen?  Your one rule.  UGH!", "NTA. You are under no obligation to handle his disrespect in a polite way", "I grew up in a family where I had to lose my shit if I wanted to be heard. It was incredibly rare that a simple \u201cplease stop\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like this\u201d was respected. Yelling wasn\u2019t even enough. My wants and needs were not respected until I freaked the fuck out. It\u2019s not exactly fun to go bananas and overreact, but for some people that is the only way they\u2019ll hear you. \n\nDave\u2019s one of those folks. If a rational conversation worked, he never would\u2019ve pestered you to allow him to smoke indoors. He DEFINITELY wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve actually smoked indoors and tried to cover it up. For that reason, NTA.", "Big NTA.  Dave is, though. And the family. I reserve judgement on the fiance.", "NTA, I smoke, haven\u2019t smoked inside a building in 18 years, I would have thrown him out too. At -40 and a wind chill I need to decide if I really need that cigarette lol.", "NTA, smoking inside is disgusting. I smoke, my best friend and boyfriend both smoke like chimneys.  We live in Canada and frequently huddle up against a blizzard to smoke.  There is no excuse.  The absolute presumption of him of him to smoke IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE.  When he had been TOLD.  NTA times a million.", "NTA they are a terrible house guest.", "NTA, he completely did what you told him not to do and there will be a smell for a long time. It doesn\u2019t matter that they feel you overreacted. It was the one rule and you feel strongly about it and he completely disrespected you. Of course they will be partially on his side they are his family.", "NTA, but learn how to communicate without screaming so much it attracts neighbors. Especially when you're mad. And especially when you're right.", "He promised not to smoke in your house, and then he broke his word.  You had good cause to be upset.  Could you have handled it more calmly?  Sure, that's possible, but I don't think you were obligated to.  I can't stand smoking either.  If someone did that in my home after I expressly prohibited it, I would probably lose my shit too.  You're not the asshole.  You're not even in the neighborhood of being the asshole.  I hope he gets in touch with you and sincerely apologizes.  I still wouldn't let him come back, even if he does.", "NTA.  Dave abused your hospitality.  He lied.  He doesn't deserve a free place to  stay.", "NEW building...I would bet $5 that the lease states NO SMOKING in the building.  His actions not only STINKs- it 1) put their lease at risk (which would also put their ability to rent a nice place next at risk), and 2) THE REASON they put that in leases?  Because smokers start fires. \n\nDave was rude, inconsiderate, put your housing at risk, out your physical safety at risk (asthma, fire).   Anyone on his side is not getting exactly how RUDE his actions were.", "He is an addict. Smoking is more important than anything else. You give even a little and he will keep taking. Let him continue to stay and he will have got away with breaking the one rule you gave him. He will do it again. NTA.", "He was the guest and you guys were doing him a huge favour.

Any time a smoker brought a computer in, it was absolutely disgusting. The fan smelled like an ashtray and everything inside has a sticky film on it.", "For real. Fuck that clown. You do not under any circumstances smoke in someone's fucking house without their permission. I won't even use my vape in other people's homes. They don't vape. Why would I put that shit into the air they're breathing? There is no reason I can't take my ass outside for a few minutes.\n\nI smoked for 17 years. Never smoked indoors. If the weather was shitty, either I went out anyway, or I just didn't fucking smoke.", "This is the wrong answer.

So that's the point of a smoking jacket?! TIL", "Why? There isn't information anywhere in the post about smoking being forbidden in the building.\n\nThey could be evicted for making unnecessary noise, though.\n\nAnd seeing this woman's edit - if she thinks a mere apology would be enough, she is very, very, very, very wrong.

Come on, now.  She mentioned he smokes multiple times a day regardless, so...\n\n> Screaming to the point that neighbors are getting concerned enough to actually come over and not just call the super is completely unhinged. OP needs therapy.\n\nNot really.  Potentially costing them a fine or eviction of smoking isn't allowed indoors there is worthy of really letting a GUEST in your home have it.  OP should certainly offer an apology to neighbor and explain the situation and reassure them this is not a regular thing.", ">Their neighbors COULD have been subjected to his smoke as well.\n\nWith all due respect, who gives a fuck?\n\nUnless smoking is absolutely forbidden in the entire building, the neighbors would have no valid reason to complain when someone smokes in someone's unit.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors do have the right to live their lives in quiet, and when someone screams bloody murder because of ***ONE*** mere fucking cigarette, they do, in fact, have a very valid reason to complain. And if she reacts like this to something so insignificant, you can't be absolutely sure that this is not the first time she's lost her shit like this and it won't be the last. \n\nYou're acting as if Dave hotboxed the entire building.
