I will say now I have some strong scent aversions, particularly to cigarettes. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin, Dave (41M) recently moved to our town but for some reason couldn\u2019t move into his new house until the 15th so he asked if he could stay with us. Dave is a smoker. I originally wanted to say no because I know how persistent cigarette odor is but my fianc\u00e9 convinced me to let him stay. I agreed with the caveat that Dave cannot, under any circumstances, smoke in the apartment. Everyone agreed and I thought it would be fine. \n\nWeather around here for the last few days has been dreadful and Dave goes out to smoke a couple of times a day so he had been asking if he could smoke with the patio doors open and I said no. Today the weather was awful, cold and rainy, and as I was driving up to our apartment I thought I would see Dave smoking out front but instead I saw the patio doors open. I was immediately suspicious so I went up to our door and the smell hit me before I even got into the house. Dave was sitting on the couch, smoking, with all the windows open and a fan on (I guess to try and hide the smell). \n\nI lost my shit. Didn\u2019t even give him time to put the cigarette out, I just started screaming at him. I called him an \u201cinconsiderate slob\u201d and a \u201cfilthy smokestack\u201d and a few more things that were worse. I was just screaming. Dave was panicking and put his cigarette out (in an ashtray thank god) and he was just trying to calm me down but I did not stop screaming. I told (well yelled) him to get his shit and to get the heck out of my apartment. I kept screaming until a neighbor showed up to see what was going on. I just grabbed my laptop and purse and left the apartment. I called my fianc\u00e9 at work and told (not very calmly) him what Dave had done and that I wasn\u2019t coming back until the apartment no longer smelled like a cheap casino. \n\nI am currently staying at a friend\u2019s place. My fianc\u00e9 called a little while ago and said Dave had left and that it didn\u2019t smell that bad and to just come home. I told him not until the smell is entirely gone.\n\nI guess Dave told my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family what happened because my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom called and, while she agreed what Dave did was wrong that I was totally out of line exploding at him like that and kicking him out. The rest of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family (at least those with my number) have been texting me telling me I am an ass because of my reaction.  Now that I\u2019ve had some time to calm down and am away from the situation I do feel kinda bad but he did break my number one rule.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for going nuclear on a house guest?", "created_utc": 1678505422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o9k7p/aita_for_going_nuclear_on_a_house_guest/", "score": 847, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You violated your own boundaries right out of the gate for the sake of someone else. Something you weren't required to do. You did so with specific rules and expectations which all parties agreed to. He then violated the dog shit out of those rules and your personal space. He knew what he was doing was wrong as evidenced by all the open windows and the fan. He said a giant \"Fuck you\" when he decided to do hat he did, so Fuck him too.", "NTA. I would lose it if someone smoked in my house. And what kind of person smokes in someone\u2019s house anyway especially after being told not to (you shouldn\u2019t even have to tell them not to)", "NTA NTA NTA!!!!\n\nThis is completely out of line. You never ever smoke inside someone else\u2019s home, especially if they asked you not to. You invited him into your home and he took it for granted.

I would be just as angry.", "NTA. As a guest, Dave was obligated to follow your rules. And smoking, in particular, is a particularly odious habit that affects everyone around the smoker (and to which some smokers are either completely nose blind to or just don't care). If the weather is bad and Dave really needed a smoke - well, that is his problem, not yours. He needs to find a way to satisfy his addiction while living with the rules he agreed to.\n\nAlso, there was no reason for your fiancee's mother to get involved in this.

Wonder how they will react to Dave disrespecting their house rules.", "NTA. That was a HUGE F You that Dave did. Not only did he smoke inside, he straight up did it on your couch. I\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t have to have everything professionally cleaned so you feel like you can live at home and Dave is a huge AH for crying to his mommy about getting yelled at. Your fianc\u00e9 is an AH for not keeping his family in check. How you run your house isn\u2019t their business and they can invite that nasty habit into their homes. I would block all of them and have a serious sit down with your fianc\u00e9. This is setting a tone for the rest of your marriage and future interactions with his family.", "NTA. Former smoker and friends with current and occasional smokers. None of us would ever, ever smoke inside of someone\u2019s house. You would not have to request this; it is just common courtesy. Maybe with weed or vapes it is slightly more socially acceptable, but even then, all reasonable people would ask if it was OK first.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Dave is a boomer who grew up with ashtrays in airplanes and doctors in cigarette commercials. Social norms had already changed significantly by the time he was a young adult.\n\nAnd the smell absolutely hangs around for a while.

What an inconsiderate and disgusting jerk.", "NTA- maybe totally going off on him wasn't the best way to handle it, however that is so not okay. \n\nIn most apartment buildings, that is grounds for eviction. Why in the world would anyone think they could smoke cigarettes in the apartment of someone who doesn't smoke, and who has explicitly said no smoking in the house while staying with them rent-free? (I do smoke btw, so i'm not on team 'cigarettes are gross')", "NTA. You had one rule and he stomped all over it. \n\nQuestion- how is your fiance responding now? Your inlaws are being Dave's flying monkeys and that sucks, but if fiance is also on board with them, you have a far bigger problem than a smoke smell.", "NTA.\nI've been smoking nearly my whole life and this is honestly the most disrespectful type of behavior.

It was no big deal. I never smoked when I went to visit family back when I was a smoker. When I got to my mid-30s, I just realized it was a dumb habit and I didn't enjoy it anymore, so I stopped altogether. It wasn't a big deal. I just stopped smoking. He really shouldn't be smoking at all while he lives with you guys. I mean, unless he's suicidal or something. That was why I took up smoking again in my later 20s after having quit for several years. I felt trapped in my life and I just thought, welp, fuck it, there's no way out of the shitty situation that my life has begun, I guess I'll enjoy cigarettes.

If he was disregarding your request the entire time, I could understand the meltdown. Screaming and kicking him out for one time is ridiculous. It was shitty weather.

That is *likely* what the family is reacting to.  If you can find it in you - should you ever be in a similar situation - to handle it more maturely, the actions of kicking Dave out when he violated your boundaries shouldn\u2019t be so dramatic.

I would be demanding that he pays for the place to be professionally cleaned too.", "[removed]", "NTA AT ALL! \n\nI'm a smoker\nI don't smoke in my own home!\n\nI don't smoke at others homes \n\nYou had 1 rule\n1 major rule\nHe knowingly broke it\n\nI'd be telling him Buh Bye also.", "NTA Jeez, you gave him ONE rule. I don't think smokers understand just how noxious cigarette smoke smells to non-smokers. And to someone with scent sensitivities? It's off the charts , intolerably foul, and it lingers!", "I am sensitive to cigarette smoke as well- if anyone lit up in my house, they would be asked to leave! Fortunately, I don\u2019t know any smokers! You have every right to kick out an inconsiderate guest, and yelling after you laid down ground rules is a natural reaction. NTA. Tell your SO no more guests in your house that are smokers, period.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA Smokers that smoke indoors are disgusting usually.", "NTA\nI have smell aversions too, usually resulting in awful headaches and nausea and sometimes even throwing up, and that can go on all day. It's so utterly disrespectful to smoke in anybody's house without permission but to do so when you have been told not to AND staying there as a guest is absolutely unacceptable. Good riddance to Dave!", "NTA I hate the smell of smoke, it feels very suffocating and I would not tolerate a guess smoking inside my house neither", "NTA- I smoke if I'm at the pub, but at work I vape instead because I can't stand the smell on myself when I go back in to the clean fresh indoor air. He couldn't get a disposable vape for 'in case of torrential downpour'?", "I\u2019m not gonna deny that I enjoy sneaking a cigarette every now and then\u2014outside, with all the doors closed\u2014but it\u2019s 2023. Everyone has known for decades how gross and unhealthy regular smoking is. So if you\u2019re a nicotine addict who has been given very generous permission by a non-smoker to light one up with conditions, you follow those conditions to the letter and don\u2019t push your luck. You set very reasonable rules, he broke them, FAFO and NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. I would Lose.My.Shit if that happened at my house. I once made the mistake of buying a used car that had at some point previously belonged to a smoker. It had been professionally detailed multiple times but you can NEVER get the smell out, especially when it rains.\n\nYes, he used an ashtray, but honestly a burn mark would just have meant you had to replace the couch. The problem is the smell, it means you have to replace EVERYTHING, and how do you replace the walls? I would not move back until your finance paid to have the apartment professionally cleaned by one of those companies that specialized in fire damage, etc. Like, walls scoured and stripped before repainting. New carpet, new couch, new curtains. And frankly you'll be lucky if you're not in trouble with the landlord/realty company. Who knows how many cigarettes Dave had before you came home and caught him? A fan is nonsense, that does nothing. I understand that it is an addiction. But smokers have to be responsible for the consequences, and not be delusional about how bad it smells and how difficult it is to get rid of.  If he was at work he would have to go outside for his smoke break, rain or no rain. Your home is no different. \n\nPersonally idk how you even lived with the smell of it on his clothes and hair.", "NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s a guest in your home and he can\u2019t follow your one simple rule to not smoke up the place. He knew about the No-smoking-indoors rule, and decided break it whenever your back was turned. You were totally right to be angry and kick him out.", "YTA. Not for the rule, but for your behavior. Screaming at people is unnecessary. At best, it doesn\u2019t really express anything but the fact that you have trouble communicating and managing anger. At worst, it is bullying and abusive. Furthermore, it reduces the likelihood that the person being screamed at will (1) actually hear your message because their defenses and/or emotional arousal will rise and (2) reduces the likelihood that they will feel any remorse because they might focus on your behavior rather than theirs. I suggest you work on managing your anger if this is relatively frequent behavior on your part. One aspect of managing anger is understanding what else you are feeling (I suspect you felt the hurt of being ignored, betrayed, and/or taken advantage of) and the second is communication.   \n\n\nDave is an AH for intentionally violating your rule and for his deceitful behavior.", "NTA and I would suggest NEVER letting another member of his family stay with you.", "ES", "From OP\u2019s post history, it sounds like FMIL already has a past of stupid opinions (like telling OP that her job is just a \u201cside gig\u201d and that she should do more than 50% of the housework just because it\u2019s not a 9-5). OP should just block the in laws phone number honestly and tell her fianc\u00e9 to deal with them.\n\nThe in laws can take a chance housing the cousin and having their houses smell like ash trays if they have a problem with her kicking him out.", "Some apartments that could get you evicted or put on a \"watch out for\" list. Or at least a hearty cleaning fine. Dave can go get a hotel room and cry about the cleaning fees after.", "i'd have either taken the oppotunity to quit or just used patches during the bad weather", "I agree she is NTA for kicking him out immediately, staying at a hotel until her fiance either somehow cleans it or the smell actually wears off completely, etc. But I disagree with a complete NTA, based on her description of going into a prolonged screaming fit \\*that literally scared the neighbors\\* when she found him. She had every right to be furious, I would even say she earned a good opening shout, but again based on her own description she was an AH though for losing her shit to that degree. That is an extreme reaction, especially for an adult. While partly this is due to the greater strength and potential for bodily harm, if the genders were reversed it would be easy to see that this response \u2014 not the justified anger itself, but the crazy screaming \u2014 was not cool.\n\nOP I\u2019d look into therapy to help you with better coping and reaction strategies in general, especially since you are just about to get married. Screaming to the degree you described about any offense that is of less than marriag-ending severity is abusive, and even in those situations it wouldn\u2019t be a good or the most effective way to react. If I were OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s family, this would be what was bothering me. Sure, Dave is an AH and deserved to be kicked out, but this reaction would make me fear for my family member marrying someone of this age who acts so unhinged when they get upset.", "Ages ago i used to smoked, and do so in my kitchen.\n A friend stayed with his gf. When they came, she was totally embarassed, told me she was newly pregnant, and that she didn't want to be entitled but if i might be okay with smoking outside as long as they were there. \nOf course I was, congrats, and no smoke inside for the rest of the week. \nThat was my place. \nIt blows my mind how someone would smoke in a nonsmokers home.", "One cigarette? Professionally cleaned? I think everyone is losing their sense of proportion. Even a week of smoking would not ruin an apartment.", "More nuclear how??  Going full Yosemite Sam and shooting off guns in the air?", "Strong agree. Kick him out and use strong language, but screaming and yelling is just weird.", "Yeah, no. \n\nEspecially if their apartment doesn't allow smoking inside, OPs reaction is completely warranted.  This could have cost them $$.\n\nLiterally no non-smoker wants to have to deal with their entire home smelling like that \"until it just goes away.\"  \n\n100% NTA.", "Blows my mind how so many people are supporting her losing her mind over this with the completely over the top reaction. You\u2019d think she came home to the guy in bed with her husband.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They go out in their garden to smoke, no matter what type of weather it is.", "When it\u2019s cold I smoke in the garage (detached and my husband also smokes cigars out there) otherwise it\u2019s in the backyard. Sometimes I\u2019ll have a cigarette after walking the kids to school and I walk in the alleyway behind houses so I don\u2019t even bother people on the sidewalk.

Bet you wouldn't.", "Having both dealt with a couch a cat has peed on and cleaned a smoker's house, I'd take cat pee any day.", "Pee doesn't give you cancer either.", "Oh yes it would. Even with professional cleaning, the smell is VERY pervasive and will keep coming back out of the walls, even after supposed cleaning. It will need a specialized company, at least, and even then it can come back in humid weather. And how do we know it was only one cigarette? It was however many cigarettes he could get away with that day until he was caught.", "Sounds like op was already simmering because she was forced into having a houseguest she didn't want in the first place and had her boundaries steamrolled when she was overruled by her fiance.   Even if smoking outside the smoke smell sticks to clothes and hair and was probably detectable in the house which probably added to op's annoyance. Him smoking in the house thinking he was being clever by opening windows, plus all the time she had from her car to the apartment suspecting what she was going to find and then finding it boiled everything over.  Was it immature yeah, but I bet Dave will never smoke in someone's house without permission ever again.  A house guest for a day or two that your don't want us one thing, but I bet he's already been there over a week. That's a lot", "It's not just \"ignoring the rules\" like Dave wore shoes in the house or didn't put the toilet seat down. It could literally get OP evicted.", "wouldn't it be a better solution to just power wash the walls since it is a bathroom? genuinely curious", "Cat pee on couch: replace the couch.\n\nSmoke in apartment: impossible to ever completely fix.
