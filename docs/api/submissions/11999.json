I will say now I have some strong scent aversions, particularly to cigarettes. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin, Dave (41M) recently moved to our town but for some reason couldn\u2019t move into his new house until the 15th so he asked if he could stay with us. Dave is a smoker. I originally wanted to say no because I know how persistent cigarette odor is but my fianc\u00e9 convinced me to let him stay. I agreed with the caveat that Dave cannot, under any circumstances, smoke in the apartment. Everyone agreed and I thought it would be fine. \n\nWeather around here for the last few days has been dreadful and Dave goes out to smoke a couple of times a day so he had been asking if he could smoke with the patio doors open and I said no. Today the weather was awful, cold and rainy, and as I was driving up to our apartment I thought I would see Dave smoking out front but instead I saw the patio doors open. I was immediately suspicious so I went up to our door and the smell hit me before I even got into the house. Dave was sitting on the couch, smoking, with all the windows open and a fan on (I guess to try and hide the smell). \n\nI lost my shit. Didn\u2019t even give him time to put the cigarette out, I just started screaming at him. I called him an \u201cinconsiderate slob\u201d and a \u201cfilthy smokestack\u201d and a few more things that were worse. I was just screaming. Dave was panicking and put his cigarette out (in an ashtray thank god) and he was just trying to calm me down but I did not stop screaming. I told (well yelled) him to get his shit and to get the heck out of my apartment. I kept screaming until a neighbor showed up to see what was going on. I just grabbed my laptop and purse and left the apartment. I called my fianc\u00e9 at work and told (not very calmly) him what Dave had done and that I wasn\u2019t coming back until the apartment no longer smelled like a cheap casino. \n\nI am currently staying at a friend\u2019s place. My fianc\u00e9 called a little while ago and said Dave had left and that it didn\u2019t smell that bad and to just come home. I told him not until the smell is entirely gone.\n\nI guess Dave told my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family what happened because my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom called and, while she agreed what Dave did was wrong that I was totally out of line exploding at him like that and kicking him out. The rest of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family (at least those with my number) have been texting me telling me I am an ass because of my reaction.  Now that I\u2019ve had some time to calm down and am away from the situation I do feel kinda bad but he did break my number one rule.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for going nuclear on a house guest?", "created_utc": 1678505422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o9k7p/aita_for_going_nuclear_on_a_house_guest/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You violated your own boundaries right out of the gate for the sake of someone else. Something you weren't required to do. You did so with specific rules and expectations which all parties agreed to. He then violated the dog shit out of those rules and your personal space. He knew what he was doing was wrong as evidenced by all the open windows and the fan. He said a giant \"Fuck you\" when he decided to do hat he did, so Fuck him too.", "NTA. I would lose it if someone smoked in my house. And what kind of person smokes in someone\u2019s house anyway especially after being told not to (you shouldn\u2019t even have to tell them not to)", "NTA NTA NTA!!!!\n\nThis is completely out of line. You never ever smoke inside someone else\u2019s home, especially if they asked you not to. You invited him into your home and he took it for granted.

I would be just as angry.", "NTA. As a guest, Dave was obligated to follow your rules. And smoking, in particular, is a particularly odious habit that affects everyone around the smoker (and to which some smokers are either completely nose blind to or just don't care). If the weather is bad and Dave really needed a smoke - well, that is his problem, not yours. He needs to find a way to satisfy his addiction while living with the rules he agreed to.\n\nAlso, there was no reason for your fiancee's mother to get involved in this.

Wonder how they will react to Dave disrespecting their house rules.", "NTA. That was a HUGE F You that Dave did. Not only did he smoke inside, he straight up did it on your couch. I\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t have to have everything professionally cleaned so you feel like you can live at home and Dave is a huge AH for crying to his mommy about getting yelled at. Your fianc\u00e9 is an AH for not keeping his family in check. How you run your house isn\u2019t their business and they can invite that nasty habit into their homes. I would block all of them and have a serious sit down with your fianc\u00e9. This is setting a tone for the rest of your marriage and future interactions with his family.", "NTA. Former smoker and friends with current and occasional smokers. None of us would ever, ever smoke inside of someone\u2019s house. You would not have to request this; it is just common courtesy. Maybe with weed or vapes it is slightly more socially acceptable, but even then, all reasonable people would ask if it was OK first.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Dave is a boomer who grew up with ashtrays in airplanes and doctors in cigarette commercials. Social norms had already changed significantly by the time he was a young adult.\n\nAnd the smell absolutely hangs around for a while.

Why in the world would anyone think they could smoke cigarettes in the apartment of someone who doesn't smoke, and who has explicitly said no smoking in the house while staying with them rent-free? (I do smoke btw, so i'm not on team 'cigarettes are gross')", "NTA. You had one rule and he stomped all over it. \n\nQuestion- how is your fiance responding now? Your inlaws are being Dave's flying monkeys and that sucks, but if fiance is also on board with them, you have a far bigger problem than a smoke smell.", "NTA.\nI've been smoking nearly my whole life and this is honestly the most disrespectful type of behavior.

It was no big deal. I never smoked when I went to visit family back when I was a smoker. When I got to my mid-30s, I just realized it was a dumb habit and I didn't enjoy it anymore, so I stopped altogether. It wasn't a big deal. I just stopped smoking. He really shouldn't be smoking at all while he lives with you guys. I mean, unless he's suicidal or something. That was why I took up smoking again in my later 20s after having quit for several years. I felt trapped in my life and I just thought, welp, fuck it, there's no way out of the shitty situation that my life has begun, I guess I'll enjoy cigarettes.

I mean I get wanting Dave out, I even get you exploded at him though obviously not the most mature reaction. But why are you so petty that you won\u2019t go back to your husband now after Dave is gone and he aired out the place?", "No & yes. Mostly NTA but raging on someone is an awful thing to do. There are better ways of handling conflict. You could have made him leave without the screaming & name calling.", "NTA.  Dave broke a promise not to stink up your house.  He got what he deserved.\n\n>texting me telling me I am an ass\n\nTell them to fuck right off.  If they don't like that, that's their problem.", "NTA\n\nI was ready to call you an AH based on the title but Dave sucks. This isn\u2019t a situation where he was cooking something bad or had bad gas etc, you told him no smoking and he agreed. Then he waited til you left and started smoking in your apartment. Fuck him and your fianc\u00e9s family supporting this sort of obviously shitty behavior.", "NTA.  Besides being disrespectful etc, OP has a strong scent aversion. I can totally understand her losing it.", "NTA. The Audacity.", "i smoked for many years but never EVER would have even considered smoking inside someone's home who requested i didn't. smoking has been curtailed in so many places for so many years now that smokers are most certainly used to the idea that they have to just deal with the outside elements anytime they want to smoke. hell, when my husband & i got cats we both climbed out onto the fire escape no matter what the weather was like (and we lived in nyc where it could get get really cold, really rainy) because we didn't want our cats exposed to the smoke! \n\nyou are so much NTA, but he is, and so is anyone giving you a hard time.", "NTA. It\u2019s almost impossible to get the smell of cigarettes out. Has Dave never heard of a coat or umbrella??", "ESH He is an asshole for smoking in your house.  That is a absolute no go. \nBut your reaction sounds completely unhinged. Kicking him out is fine, but you went waaay overboard. Please learn how to manage your anger better.  If you unleash that at your fiance or kids,  that's abusive.", "ESH\n\nObviously he's a giant AH for going against the one explicit condition you had for him staying in your home, knowing how upsetting it would be for you, after repeatedly being told he absolutely was not allowed. It's beyond inconsiderate to smoke inside even without all the specific discussion around never ever doing that. He's so extremely in the wrong here.\n\nBut you're a whole ass adult and you were screaming so much and for so long that the neighbours got involved? That's unhinged. Kicking him out is totally reasonable. Calling him gross and inconsiderate and anything else you felt like is pretty understandable. An initial \"what the FUCK do you think you're doing?\" shouted reaction is fine. But it sounds like you went way beyond all that. It sounds like you lost your goddamn mind, and that...shouldn't be happening. I don't think refusing to come home until the smell is gone is an overreaction, and I think kicking him out is the only reasonable course of action, but the \"going nuclear\" sounds like a bit much.", "No, one rule. Don\u2019t smoke in the house. That\u2019s it. He deserves everything he got", "And he ruined a NEW BUILD", "This! I cannot believe so many people are OK with this behaviour. Sounds like the commotion was so bad the neighbour was 5 seconds away from calling the cops but it's apparently NBD cus the smoker was in the wrong first? And don't forget this is in their own words so I'm willing to bet it was actually worse. OP needs to look into some anger management classes...\n\nAlso not defending the smoker or saying he should not have been thrown out, OP is in the right for that, but for everything else 'unhinged' is the right word.", "Right? OP has every right to be upset and angry and kick Dave out for blatantly ignoring the rules but the screaming and belittling to me is really overboard and concerning in my opinion. ESH\n\nI'm so surprised at everyone just focusing on Dave's behaviour and not OP's.", "Exactly my thought!", "I once had to clean out a smoker's computer, it was an experience I doubt I'll ever forget haha. I stunk of smoke by the end too \ud83d\ude05"]}
