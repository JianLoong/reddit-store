Lord!\n\nNTA OP, now Google \"spousal support\" and :\"child support\" and your State, and start the train wheels moving. This is intolerable!", "I get sick to my stomach if she's crying too long and too hard. I sometimes go to bed still hungry but afraid to put her down long enough to eat because my husband refuses to hold her most of the time. He's so lenient with our older kids because they can \"look after themselves\" but is way too hard on the baby.", "My fourth did this too - turned out he just wanted to be involved with meals. Once I propped him up in his bassinet so he could see us all at the table and he was perfectly happy, so that was the plan until he was eating with us.", "As for the eating disorder I wasn't diagnosed after my ex but for a long time I ate 3 rice cakes and an apple a day. After marrying my husband it got better for a while but I got obsessed again and was counting calories and exercising 8 hours a day. I had a seizure eventually and thought that was the cause so I finally stopped. He supported stopping because that was scary af. They haven't figured out the cause of my seizures so I just wonder if I took it too far and got scared to diet again. My calorie counting never stopped though and I'm definitely not overeating. I eat a few snacks until dinner then I'm ravenous but not enough to be overboard. It's definitely more than while I was pregnant because I was so sick throughout that I couldn't usually finish my plate. I breastfed my last child and gained a huge amount of weight despite eating healthy and exercising too. But I wasn't nearly as hungry that time as I am now and I eat even healthier. My favorite snack is green beans.", "She don't have eating disorder, she is breastfeeding and having small child. That's like doing crossfit 8 hours a day energy wise. And many woman gain weight because of breastfeeding and loose it soon after they stop, hormones are so fun.", "We take turns cooking but I usually pressure him to cook meals he's better at. We used to eat at the table but one year we went without a table because my 9 year old(then 4) broke the old one. He broke it by jumping on it and it broke in half because it was old table that can pull out to add slats to be longer. He learned exactly why we told him to stop climbing that day. It took a long time to get a new table and it's smaller so usually one person can't sit at the table. It'll be worse once the baby is old enough for solids so we'll need a bigger table.  It's basically a table for 4 but 5 people have been trying to cram in to eat. I tried pushing to just try to figure it out but my husband was happy to let the kids eat where ever as long as they didn't make a mess. That created the bad habit of eating at their computers. \n\nBack to cooking. When he cooks I usually deal with the baby because she refuses to be put down. She doesn't mind her dad but freaks out if I am not holding her while she sleeps. Sometimes this coincides with dinner time so unless he holds her or cooks she will cry. If he'd take over cooking when I was if she just wanted to be held to sleep I wouldn't mind that but he just sits on his computer and refuses to help cook or with her so I end up juggling both cooking and the baby. He never holds her long enough for me to eat either most of the time unless I'm clearly in distress.", "I've tried 3. She hates them because they hold her up and down(basically between my boobs). I'm also plus sized with large boobs so 2 I've tried are very cramped while the 3rd held her too loose and on her back(a sling). The biggest problem is when she sleeps she wants to be held a very specific way. She basically wants to lay horizontal to both boobs chest to chest which no sling I've found can accomplish. I'm basically a walking set of pillows to her but she tolerates my husband just fine for short periods of time. I will admit she's very specific about her needs and is not afraid to demand them. My older kids were actually easier as babies. They were perfectly happy to chill on a play mat with toys or me nearby.\n\nI think as it gets warmer she hates the carrier more. We both sweat waaaaay more with the carriers.", "Talk to a lawyer about how much alimony and child support you could get in a divorce. NTA", "You have a right to any assets from the marriage. A consult is at least worth it to get a good idea of how much you actually need to divorce if you haven't already. Then you can start with a solid plan of how to get there. \n\nDo you have any friends to lean on? How about some sort of mom's/parents group you might find some community in?\n\nI know I'm simplifying a lot. It won't be easy, but it really may be accessible to you more than you realize. I've heard some of the charity and assistance subs on reddit are actually pretty good for fundraising, too. Good luck!", "I know, it's still really hard to see them crying and ignore it but it does get easier the more you do it, because you know that you're doing it to help yourself and in turn help them so they can be well fed. After that you can give them all the love and attention and they'll have forgotten all about it \n\n\nHaving a baby is hard work and your husband is making this so much harder for you. Almost like he's actively trying to make you struggle\n\nDoes he help out with anything else around the home? And does he actually help look after the other children or just think they're old enough to raise themselves?", "Darnit, yeah, that horizontal position doesn\u2019t sound like any sling I know!  \n\nHere\u2019s wishing for you that she starts liking some other sleeping situations soon \ud83d\ude0a", "We rent and are still paying off the car. No real assets. The car is in my name but I don't even drive so it'd be petty to keep it since it's not even paid off.  I feel like a divorce would be so messy because of the stuff I have in my name and what's in his.", "It's hit or miss. I will try to make my kids help with chores but sometimes he over rides me by saying I'm being too hard on them. He does do dishes but rarely the baby dishes which accumulates fast and has its own sponge. He's not a total monster but he makes sure to make me feel inadequate when I complain.  Yesterday he made an off hand comment that I should get a job even though he knows we can't afford daycare and I have health issues. He does the bare minimum without really listening to what I tell him I need to focus on my health and the baby. I'd k*ll to eat without hearing my daughter crying or having to juggle her and my plate.", "A lawyer helps with the messiness. Which still would be easier than staying with this man.", "\"He's not a total monster\". When your daughter is all grown up would you be happy for her to settle for a man who isn't \"a total monster\"? \n\nYou deserve so much better than this. You're clearly such a caring, loving woman and you deserve that treatment in return", "Sweetie, your teenagers have hands. And headphones. Can they not hold their baby sibling for ten minutes while you inhale a bowl of something?\n\nI'm not saying your man gets a free pass -- he's outrageous -- I'm just looking for other options so you don't starve to death here.", "I promised them when I got pregnant that they didn't need to help. I desperately want their help but asking them to take out the trash is difficult enough. I overheard my 15 yo daughter talking to her therapist on zoom comparing her hatred for babies to kicking a dog for barking so I don't trust her at all with the baby. I didn't mean to overhear but you have to pass her room to get from the bathroom to the living room or my bedroom. She feels like I've tried to replace her but that's not the case. I'm not pushing her to have a relationship and it is slowly working because she does sometimes come to see the baby. I don't want to make it a chore and also want to keep everyone safe and comfortable.  Not pushing it is helping with her a lot because she sometimes even tells me about recent research about child development thats relevant to the baby. My oldest is a nervous Nelly and I feel like he might drop her on accident. Hes also stated the same worry. My 9 year old is too hyper and too little to hold her. Id be a nervous wreck the whole time. They all do grab a diaper or a bottle of breastmilk when I need it(I exclusively pump which is more time consuming) but I know my kids limits. They aren't the parents.  My husband should be the one holding her not them. Just wish they'd do their chores though. If they did their chores and dished up their own plates that'd be fine by me. It's not their responsibility to raise their little sister. My 15 year old actually asked her father to make her tacos tonight and I did tell her off for it because she's old enough to do it by herself. My oldest does his own but she waited until hubby had already sat down to ask him to make hers. He usually does but he just was clearly not ready to humor that tonight. I think she ended up doing it herself."]}
