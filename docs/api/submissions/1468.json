After Graduation she moved with her family 1500 miles away. I had also moved around 80 miles away from where we went to school.\n\nWe talked alot the first few years. When she came back to visit about a handful of times, she would stay with someone from our hometown. I would be the one to travel down to visit Pearl even though she had a rental. Not once had she ever made her way to see me or my home. In her defense I never went to visit her. I was busy raising 3 kids and could not afford to take a big trip like that. \n\nSo the years go by we talk less and less. Then 14 years later she calls and tells me she pregnant and moving back to our home town. I say great you'll have to come up and visit. Never happened. So she had been back for 3 months I received one call and one text, stuff about how nice it is being back. \n\nIt's now like mid January and received an invite for her baby shower that she has planned for Super Bowl Sunday. I immediately know I'm not going. \nI am the head bartender at a great sports/local bar. I am scheduled to work that day. We go all out for the Super Bowl. It's a big deal any year but this year our teams in the playoffs and have a real chance at making it to the SB. My boss was expecting me to help set up the bar, help with food, etc. We make a day of it. The party starts early and never mind it's the biggest money making day in our bar. \n\nSo I immediately call to decline the invite, I call her not her cousin that the RSVP's supposed to go to. Well she started freaking out. How dare I pick a stupid game over her. She kept saying the game was at night, why couldn't I come and just go in late to work. I tried to explain that people were depending on me and I also couldn't afford to lose the money I would be making. She just said I was being horrible to her. I had even said I would visit during the week and bring her a present. \n\nShe got really upset when I asked her why she would plan a party on 1. Such short notice? 2. On SBS in an area whose team was potentially going to be in the SB for the first time in a long time? She hung up on me. \n\nI was then called repeatedly for about two weeks by her cousin, mother and some chick I didn't even know telling me how I'm ruining her day, what a lousy friend I was, how could I pick football over Pearl. So I called her back to try and explain once more that I wasn't trying to offend her I just had a prior commitment. It ended in a lot of name calling by Pearl and then I was told to never contact her again. AITA\n\nI did never get an answer to why it had to be so soon or on that day. Also my team made it and won the SB.", "created_utc": 1667621075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymjmpj/aita_for_bartending_super_bowl_sunday_instead_of/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
