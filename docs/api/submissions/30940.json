For example, I rely on my girlfriend to pick up more specific ingredients from the Asian grocery store because it's close to her work.  I could do it myself, but I rely on her instead.", "I think dad has done this by saying \"get the f out then\". It's not a subtle hint, it's pretty unambiguous.", "Yup, this is his dad's not so passive way of telling OP to GTFO. Do I agree with what he's doing? Hell no it's def gross af...but I can understand being frustrated at 4 extra people (with two \u22645) living your house. Dad's probably pissed coz instead of moving out OP had another kid.", "So what does he do while he's saving up? Just deal with his dad exposing his kids to sexual sounds and keep his head low because it's not his house?", "This!  And his dad can manage his finances on his own. SMH. The grandad is disgusting, insensitive, and immoral. A 5 yr old knows, even if tbey don't have the right words.", "U don't have to be an American to have that mentality some. That mentality is originated from the US.", "You're wrong. I have 2 children from a previous relationship who ended up on life support recently after we separated. It WAS me that got that fkn phone call, I told them to let his parents decide, but they were already at the hospital with him and yet, they rang me, because we lived de-facto, and I WAS his listed next of kin. Also for his super and insurance. ,*eyeroll\n You don't know what you're talking about! SMH.", "Totally agree with you here. It screams of total disrespect for the children, their emotional and mental wellbeing.", "It is considered a form of sexual abuse, as is exposing them to porn", "I agree with the son, dad should be more considerate. However, his paying bills is not a favour to his dad. He is using the largest of utilities with his gf and 2 children while dad is single.\nIn the end, his dad can be more considerate but doesn't need to be. Son should move out", "This wasn\u2019t meant to be controversial. There was an open question on whose kids these were.", "Truth it's closer to my job and daughters school", "Your parents having sex is sexual abuse if you can hear it? What?", "What mentality is that, exactly? My house, my rules? Or don't bite the hand that feeds you?", "> In the end, his dad can be more considerate but doesn't need to be. \n\nHow the fuck doesnt he need to be? Even if it is legal, its still shitty as fuck to do that to people that young, from your own family. He *should* be more considerate.", "Wait I just got why you are downvoted.\n\nIt's reddit and his dad is a ..... wait for it..... landlord! Ofcourse his dad can't do what he wants in his own house, it's reddit and he's landlordin him", "He says by listing bills......", "That is still a financial reliance because of the definition of reliance.  But if you want to say that it's not out of necessity or a desire to save money, and it's literally because there is absolutely no other suitable rentals ANYWHERE within a reasonable distance to your job and daughters school, you can. I obviously won't believe you, but you can say that if you feel a need to win in a discussion that started because I was pointing out that someone was assuming too much without proper context, when I didn't even imply you lived with your father out of necessity.", "My house, my rules. It's a very disturbing phrase to use against your own family.", "Just because its \" wrong\" in your culture im pretty sure kids in 3rd world countries live thru this every day. 15 people living in a hut and such.", "I think the OP is a bit entitled to try to boss his dad around, because not only does he owe his life to his dad, he also is living under his roof because he is doing him a favor. He's an adult with his own family. The least he could do is to be thankful for the opportunity.", "And we see how well that works out for the third world, right?", "I'm from New Zealand lmfao. We have one of the worst drinking cultures I've come across. Which is why I don't buy into the toxic culture like you do. Alcohol kills more people than any other drug. Just because you were raised to think this way doesn't mean it's okay or normal lol.", "Who knows, OP didn't really explain the whole exchange of responsibility and burden of the house. For all we know it might be a generational household. And OP has said he bears almost all the bills. And let me tell you, OP's dad is an old man. He ain't gonna want to live alone without a family for too long", "Yeah im pretty sure they dont really have so much trauma from someone fucking next to them.", "Im from Europe so im pretty sure our drinking culture is not that much better", "Correct, there may be info missing here. But for gods sake, let the old man have his sex, he's not gonna be able to for much longer.", "You can be pretty sure about anything you want, doesn\u2019t make it factual or truthful. Again, we see how well it\u2019s working out for them aren\u2019t we", "That's your response? \"I'm pretty sure ours is not that much better\".... right after supporting supplying alcohol to minors. Go figure, and go find some brain cells. You might be able to come up with some sound logic."]}
