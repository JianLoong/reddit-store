The Dad has a right to do as he pleases in his own home, and didn't decide to have TWO additional children without a place of his own.", "Doesn\u2019t he provide the house?", "Even if he's trying to get them to leave, what kind of person is he for being comfortable enough to have s*x when any children are around? It doesn't matter that they are his grandkids, no child should be listening to that.", "Cackling! \ud83e\udd23 Thanks for that.", "OMG that is hilarious \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Best comment!", "This story is crazy and I completely forgot what this thread is about while reading. Wft, buddy sounds deranged.", "Op is paying the biggest bill.", "I can\u2019t wait to hear what happens when they leave and then his dad is left to pay everything in his own. My guess is he can\u2019t, or it\u2019ll be really tight and then blames it on his son for leaving.", "get out of reddit, OP's dad.", "That's not what i'm saying. He knows the kids are still up and awake and he knows they hear him. The 5 years old is even repeading the sounds... did you even read the whole story? The problem isn't that adult children hear him. He is loud knowing a 5 year old hears him and is awake", "Assuming you meant WHILE their kids are at home. Otherwise... \ud83d\ude33", "It's always happened, yes. But not so that the young ones can hear. That is sexual abuse", "I walked in on my parents once. Just once. And that image still haunts me to this day almost 30 years later. It\u2019ll pop into my head when I\u2019m with my husband and I have to quickly think about something else.", "Having 2 kids is also not something you can do instantly - and yet, the OP still managed to do it.  The OP isn't the AH - but if you want to raise your kids in a home where you control the environment, get the home before the kids.", "Of course he CAN do whatever he wants but grandpa should have more respect for himself, the women he's with and his grandkids.  The least he could do is warn them that he's bringing a woman home....", "Of thats the case the OP should put hus big boy pants on and move out of the house. It is not the world's job or responsibility to raise and make the world a safe place for them. That is your job a parent.", "You should choose between location and good environment for your kids. I believe good father will choose environment but opportunistic will choose location!", "I completely agree with you", "It would gross me out, but let's not pretend it's somehow damaging for kids to be aware that sex exists - this whole thread reeks of weird puritanical American shit.", "The Dad may have that legal right, but framing it in those terms gives the Dad moral authority in this case.  \n\nWhich he does not deserve.", "Right dad is 52 not 82 and banging women all the time. That is NOT bad health. Like the kids hearing it is gross but sack up and get your own place instead of whining online. Sheesh", "You\u2019re welcome! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "At the very least, he loves himself more than he loves them", "For real. Some people get crazy as they age. Even if they aren't his grandchildren, how is he comfortable having s*x when small innocent kids are around? Just ew.", "It actually IS sexual abuse. And the dad/grandfather could get in legal trouble for it in many places. Also, if op doesn't do anything about it (which they are by looking for another place) the kids could be taken", "He pays or paid the mortgage?  You say you pay the biggest bill? Well the next one would be property tax which is likely over $300/month. I highly doubt you pay that if it\u2019s not your house.   As far as other utilities you should be paying them all as you have a 4 person family bs your dad.", "And?   Like I said, when you have 3 generations in teh same home, it's going to happen.", "Lol yeah eh. It definitely could be read badly and not the way it was intended!", "Good catch.\n\nMind you, I grew up with a guy where that was happening to his sister and him.\n\nHe ended up killing his parents.", "Oh, I'm pretty certain the young ones have heard it.   It's not actually sexual abuse.", "When deciding where to live with two young kids I think its reasonable to expect the adults will not fill the entire household with the echoes of extremely loud sex. That isn\u2019t something a reasonable person should be expected to consider as a possibility.\n\nWhen you live with someone there is a basic level of consideration you owe them, no matter who is paying or what else is going on. The answer here isnt that the kids have to listen to their grandfather\u2019s nightly sexual orchestra for the next few months", "This.", "I do not know play loud tv shows put headphones on the kids", "Doesn't. Matter. It is HIS HOUSE. Not OP's. It is also OP's responsibility to make aure his kids have a safe home, not their Grandfathers.", "So you think it\u2019s fine to have sex near children? If the children can hear it he\u2019s having sex too close to them and that\u2019s gross and seems pedophilic that\u2019s he\u2019s fine with little kids hearing him have sex", "Do you think it\u2019s alright for adults to have sex near kids?", "No don\u2019t you know it\u2019s only okay to expose children to sex on the internet between random strangers? But as for them knowing that their family members are in healthy, sexual relationships? That\u2019s inappropriate \ud83d\ude44", "I hope OP's 5 year old understands that when they're older their dad did their best to get them out of that situation as best as he could and it seems you don't want to understand that. That's kinda disgusting, sorry.", "So Grandpa is perfectly OK?  He's a good person?  He made the right choices?\n\nHe's a safe person to be around?  To have your kids around?", "Some people don\u2019t consider mortgages a bill.", "Of course not. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t let adults have sex near my kids in my home, and I don\u2019t expect free rent from adult that do.", "They will.  Most kids do come to terms with it, seeing as little kids walking in on the parents is a pretty common experience.\n\nI understand, I just don't give a fuck.\n\nHaving sex in the same room as them?  That's abuse.  Hearing adults in your home?  That's standard.", "He said he's in the Caribbean. Are you a realtor in the Caribbean? You have no idea what the rental market is like there.  OP said it is difficult to find rentals in the area and that he pays all the bills for the household except for water- his father pays that.  So the grandfather is saving money by having them there and he should be more respectful of his grandchildren.", "Men don't like to be held accountable", "Is this OP dad???", "What would you call it then? Assuming this is an English/ American language thing, as any monthly outgoing necessities would be considered a bill", "It\u2019s literally not free rent when he pays \ud83d\ude02", "1) My parents had intimacy. IN. MY. BED. I was 6 at the time and never came to terms with that. I'm 23 currently.\n2) Your definition of \"most kids come to terms with it\" is terrifying me.\n3) OP never said that the 5 year old walked in on it. what I can assume is that the 5 year old has dealt with this within multiple occurrences. If not every single day. I just saw a comment where a 30 year old said that they still have images popping in her brain of their parents being intimate. I don't think they came to terms with that either.", "Ok if rental is so high and your income is not that sufficient ,please don\u2019t plan another child. simple as that! OP is also using his father is for saving money on high rent and travel cost! It\u2019s not just grandpa taking advantage but OP is also taking advantage!", "I call it a mortgage. Did op specifically say they paid the rent/mortgage? I didn\u2019t see that. But if they did, they can afford to pay their own rent, and they are subjecting their children to this crap for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m assuming from the tone of the post that they don\u2019t pay the mortgage. Did it specifically say they did? Or are you just assuming this?", "Did op specifically say he paid the mortgage or rent?", "That's different, though, than simply hearing it from another room.\n\nAgain - your issues aren't my concern.  As somebody who was sexually abused as a kid, I can't take \"hearing sex\" seriously as abuse.  Sorry.\n\nAdults still being freaked out their parents had sex are just a wee bit too precious for me to take seriously.   Are parents supposed to be celibate for 18 years after having a kid?  Spare me.\n\nUsing your bed?  Yeah, that's nasty and is over the line.   \n\nLeaving your kid in the next room colouring while you fuck a john?  Yup, that's abuse.   (That was a friend of my roommates, boasting about it).\n\nIf you can't get over knowing your parents had sex by the time you are 30, you have much deeper issues to deal with."]}
