No misbehaving or tantrums, just tossing and turning and her dad saying \"go to sleep.\"  When she did get to sleep, she'd wake up again after a few hours. By 11ish years old, I finally decided enough. We homeschool, so there's no need for her to get up early. I told her as long as she was in her room and quiet, that she could watch something on her tablet or read. No bedtime at all. It wasn't (and still isn't) uncommon for her to be awake at 1-2 am.

Something I\u2019ve had to learn the (very) hard way is that some kids seriously struggle with sleep. And I can\u2019t imagine how much harder it can be when you add in autism. It\u2019s your job to make sure he gets the sleep he needs and sometimes that means doing what you have to. If he needs a pacifier so be it. If he needs a specific blanket then so be it. Childhood antics don\u2019t last forever and I think nowadays some people get so caught up in trying to take comfort measures from their kids or force them to outgrow their comforts before they\u2019re ready. In reality, even a lot of adults have certain comforts. A pacifier, a blanket, and some snuggles isn\u2019t the end of the world. Kids _should_ take comfort in their parents presence.

I suspect my husband falls somewhere on the spectrum. Probably mild, but he refuses to get tested. I also suspect that my daughter might take after him. She\u2019s still quite young, just 2, so there\u2019s no knowing for sure yet. But sleep has always been a huge point of contention. I\u2019ve been bed sharing with her for 2 years because it\u2019s the only way she can sleep. And like you, I tried everything. I read dozens of books, was knee deep in research, I tried it all. We have a bedtime routine now that gets both of us the sleep we need, but I\u2019ve gotten crap for it from other parents. She has a specific noise machine that plays one particular sound. It also lights up and needs to be set to one specific colour. She gets to lay in bed and drink warm milk from a bottle (this is what I get the most crap for). She doesn\u2019t use a bottle any other time of the day and I keep her toothbrush beside the bed and immediately brush her teeth when it\u2019s finished. Then she gets her pacifier (which she only gets at bedtime or in public if she isn\u2019t coping) but it has to be a specific kind. Then we lay there and snuggle. \n\nOther moms have tried their hardest to scare me away from this. Saying I\u2019m allowing bad habits to continue and I\u2019m damaging her. You know what was worse? Her never really settling and waking up every 30 minutes and then being exhausted for days. It was worse when she would scream and scream and scream. Not just crying. Every mom knows their child\u2019s cry. This was genuine distress and seemed to border on fear, not just her being mad. I tried so hard for so long because so many people said we would damage her if we didn\u2019t force her into her own bed and take away the comfort measures. But now she\u2019s not afraid of going to bed. She even tells me if she wants to go to bed early. \n\nNot every kid is the same. Just like not every adult is the same.

Eventually they just gave in and decided it would work itself out eventually. My pediatrician supported that plan.
