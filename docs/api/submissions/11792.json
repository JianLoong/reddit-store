No misbehaving or tantrums, just tossing and turning and her dad saying \"go to sleep.\"  When she did get to sleep, she'd wake up again after a few hours. By 11ish years old, I finally decided enough. We homeschool, so there's no need for her to get up early. I told her as long as she was in her room and quiet, that she could watch something on her tablet or read. No bedtime at all. It wasn't (and still isn't) uncommon for her to be awake at 1-2 am.

I\u2019m autistic and was terrified of sleeping as a kid. It took me way longer than all my friends to be able to sleep by myself, like an embarrassing amount of time. I was just so scared of ghosts, and I had chronic insomnia and nightmares. It would take me over an hour or more to fall asleep, and then I would wake up multiple times at night. Eventually I learned to put a pillow on both sides and burrow under a blanket to feel safe and just wait it out.

Why didn't she just, I don't know, have a neuro-typical child? /s\n\nI could be giving advice like that, because my kids have been truly easy mode kids. One of them has always fought sleep and stayed awake late (No matter what we did. She didn't even nap after she was 2, so it wasn't like she just slept too much during the day. We didn't stop with her naps, she did it herself.), but when she's out she's out big time. The other one goes to sleep pretty much as soon as his head hits the pillow. Or a pillow. Or the floor.

He was weaned off but about a year ago he suffered trauma at the hand of his father (we've been separated for 3 years and it was his custody week-end). Along with other consequences from the trauma, he went through a bout of regression after that : he had pee accidents during the day and wore a diaper at night again for about 5 months, and he went back to the paci to soothe. The accidents were over by the end of the summer, but the paci is still there.\n\nI get judged a lot when people see him with it. He doesn't have it at school or outside the house normally, but sometimes it's not a good day and he needs it to the store or the park or whatever. I can't count how many people have said something regarding the paci and I feel so much shame and anger everytime. I tried to take it away but it makes him suffer for now and I can't stand it. So if he needs it, he can have it. I go to the dentist regularly to check up on his teeth and honestly I don't know how I'm going to manage when the dentist says we have to stop now. I dread it.\n\nIt turned into a bit of TMI but I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. We do what we can for our kids, we do what works for us and them. Nobody else.

Then, he couldn't take them when they left the house. Then, only in his room. Next, only when in/on his bed. Then, only naps or bedtime. Last, only bedtime. Each step was 2-4 weeks. It took a while, but worked really well. For them! I've always remembered this and it was probably 30 years ago.
