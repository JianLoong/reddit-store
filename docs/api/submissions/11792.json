We're just working at our own pace lol.", "She used to be my best friend, believe it or not. Now I dread seeing her lol. Oh how motherhood changes a person.", "Okay, ignore that guy.\n\nMy autistic daughter also has sleep issues. Melatonin made a huge difference for her, under the advice and supervision of her pediatrician.", "Put him in his own bed and leave him there, and don't just give up if he cries, complains, makes a fuss, etc. That's literally all there is to it, you can't lose a battle of wills to a five year old.", "His teeth are fine *for now* but research shows thumb sucking and pacis cause issues with bite and teeth in general over time.\n\nNTA tho because some kids and even adults on the spectrum just can\u2019t be \u201cnormal\u201d and it\u2019s okay and not anyone\u2019s fault. My older brother is 24 and mentally is still a child. He has his comfort items and my mom chooses her battles. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing great and you and your child both will eventually get through this. Sending good vibes", ">His pediatrician is somewhat clueless\n\nDoes that mean the pediatrician doesn't agree?", "My son has sensory issues and struggles to sleep.  If he sleeps in his bedroom on school nights, he's covered in blankets (included a weighted one) with Christmas lights and music.   If it isn't a school night, he's most comfortable in the basement squeezed onto a tiny chair or the little sofa.  He needs sleep and the ability to function.  I have no idea why people care so much about things that have no impact on them at all.", "It's cute right up until there is an \"accident\" (re: often not at all an accident), and then you have to wash 12 fleece blankets.", "That\u2019s good to hear. Don\u2019t let someone else dictate the pace your child needs to move at. Different people have different needs, and it\u2019s super unfair of your SIL to assume that all kids need the same care/treatment. She\u2019s coming from the perspective of allistic parenting. It\u2019s a different ballgame, and her articles probably don\u2019t take those factors into account. You do you. SIL needs to mind her own business and stop projecting her opinions onto you and your child.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve lost your best friend.", "Did you read the post?", "Is this the SIL lol", "He didn't sleep for over forty eight hours last we did that. My son has seizures, sleep exhaustion makes it worse (and is the reason I stopped extinction). Its not a battle of wills, its a \"Please dont die,\" situation.", "Did you not read the post??? She tried this and the child didn't sleep for over 48 hours. This is not a neurotypical child that you're holding to typical standards. Quite simply put, you sound very ignorant on this subject.", "No, it means he's clueless. Doesn't know what to do about his issues.", "That would be a pain surely. I think I might get a bit scared everyday when I *could not find my child* until a little disembodied voice came out from under the blankets or a head popped out.", "They did, but don\u2019t worry. They\u2019re an expert at this /s\n(Btw love the user name)", "Yep.", "Yes, I read your original post. You tried it for two nights and then gave up, so now he knows he just needs to hold out a little while and you give in. The longer you keep it up, the worse he'll get.\n\nLike I said it's your kid, do whatever you want, but your SIL is 100% correct about the fact you're not helping him in the long run.", "Neurotypical or not, nobody can stay awake indefinitely. Giving up after two nights just teaches the kid that digging his heels in works.", "Is it possible to look into a pediatrician who knows more about autism and sleep? I know specialists can be expensive, but it might be worthwhile. Regardless, unless SIL has an MD with a fellowship in pediatric psychiatry or a PhD in child development or something like that, f*** her.", "Thanks!", "Okay and what is your solution to the seizure issue? Obviously I want him sleeping unassisted but I'd also prefer if he didn't, you know, seize.", "I see no evidence that you are a child development specialist, a pediatrician, a neurologist, a physical therapist or an occupational therapist on your posts. Why do you think you know better about this neurodivergent child than his own mother?", "Autistic children are not \u201cdigging in their heels.\u201d My daughter is autistic and also has sleep issues. She has had nights where she was sobbing from exhaustion. She would have done anything to be able to sleep. She couldn\u2019t.\n\nDo you think they\u2019re doing this for funsies? Or to win some battle of wills with their parents? They. Literally. Can\u2019t. Sleep. And they hate it just as much as we do.", "Neurodivergent children have nearly died because the parents can't find the correct cup or utensile. You have absolutely no clue how the neurodivergent brain works. They aren't throwing a tantrum to get their way. Their brain is just wired differently and you can't expect them to force themselves into the status quo. The mother also needs to sleep as well. When is the last time you took care of a special needs child after going 2 days without sleep? Because it sounds like you've had the privilege to never experience it, yet you think you have the knowledge to judge OPs situation. Maybe you're the SIL.", "I do plan on switching him soon (:", "I'm not a GP. If he needs anti-seizure medicine, of which there are dozens of kinds, then take him to the doctor and get him some.", "are you serious lol, the **entire point** of this sub is to post and ask people for their opinions, and I'm giving mine\n\nyou're acting like I showed up at this woman's house and started shouting through the window", ">Neurotypical or not, nobody can stay awake indefinitely.", "OP posted here asking people for their opinions - y'know, the entire point of the sub - and I've given mine.\n\nIf you want to give OP your own different opinion, go do that. I'm not really interested in debating mine with you, especially since your opening salvo was to insult me.", "So in your learned medical opinion it\u2019s safe for the child to go more than 48 hours without sleep, even if it causes seizures?", "We are currently trialing meds but we don't even know whats causing them so it is a little hard to medicate. We know sleep deprivation/exhaustion, over heating and hunger can trigger them, but thats it.", "She didn\u2019t ask if she was the AH for not sleep training her son. She asked if she was TAH for telling off her sister. Parents of neurodivergent children struggle alone for years. They don\u2019t need uninformed opinions of how to parent on top of the grief and difficulty they are already experiencing.", "Calling someone ignorant isn't an insult. It just means you're uneducated about the subject. And you can deliver your opinion, but that doesn't mean you're qualified to offer a relevant judgment about her parenting. Because, again, you're ignorant.", "OK, well I hope his pediatrician figures it out sooner rather than later, for his sake and yours. Best of luck.", ">She didn\u2019t ask if she was the AH for not sleep training her son. She asked if she was TAH for telling off her sister.\n\nYes I know, you'll notice my original comment specifically addressed that and returned a verdict of 'NTA'. Don't waste your time and mine telling me things that are self-evident.", "I'm not going to debate what is or isn't an insult with you either.", "Probably for the best. Because I find it incredibly insulting to tell a special needs parent that they're going to \"fuck their child up for life.\" because said parent accomodates said special needs."]}
