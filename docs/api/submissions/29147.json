Our sleeping situation isn't ideal at the moment because because we live in a 2 bedroom apartment. The girls share one room, and the boys share the other and our mom sleeps in the main area with the baby. I currently share a bed with my 6 yo sister, because my 4yo sister is a bed wetter. Myself and my mom are saving for a set of bunk beds but it's a while off yet. \n\nRecently, one of my friends parents weren't able to collect her after school, and since my place was the closest to school she came over. We went into my room, where my sisters were playing and she noticed the two beds and asked where I sleep and so I told her I sleep with my sister and when she asked why I told her. \n\nWell, anyways, she went home and told her parents who reported my mom to child services, who paid us a visit. They said each child needs a bed of their own and they'll be coming back twice a month for checks and stuff until we do. Me and my mom are now really stressed and I've been missing school to take extra shifts so the school phoned family services again which just made things worse.\n\nI ended up going into school and getting into an argument with my friend, where I told her she had no right to tell her parents and get me into this mess and that she was a cunt who needs to learn when to keep her mouth shut. She told me she was just trying to help me and I said she should have helped by not saying anything. She got really upset at me, told our other friends who now all think I'm an asahole.

Not because of sharing a bed with your sister, but because a family of seven is shoved into a two-bedroom apartment, and your family is dependent on the earnings of a 16-year-old. I need to stress this to you: your living situation does not sound normal. That is why your friend told her parents and that is why they called CPS. If you are willing to share it, I would like to hear how your family got to this point.", "NAH.\n\nIt sounds like she really was trying to help you, the only way she knew how. A teenager who didn't grow up with poverty isn't going to have the best set of resources for that. But you aren't an asshole either for being frustrated.\n\nI think the asshole is a system that allows a family to struggle so much that a teenager has to compromise her future by skipping school to buy a place to sleep.\n\nAre you close at all to buying those bunk beds? Would it help to get an air mattress in the meantime so at least you can show social services that everyone is sleeping separately?", "NAH\n\nWhy is your mom continuing to have kids when she clearly can't care for the ones she already has?\n\nLike if she was a single mother of one or two kids and struggling -okay. But this lady is at 7 kids and still going (considering one's a baby). It's highly selfish for someone to continue having kids when they can't actually take care of them\n\nYour friend did nothing wrong - that is definitely not a healthy environment for that many kids. If you can't afford enough beds, are you all being fed as much as you should? Have clothes that you need? etc\n\nYou are also entitled to feel upset about this because of course you love your mother even if she isn't taking care of y'all the way that is required.\n\n**EDIT: OP has left comments elsewhere that add even more clarity, they are:**\n\nDaddy #1: Had two kids and then dipped\n\nDaddy #2: Is now in prison. Mom had a few kids with this guy\n\nDaddy #3: Is legally not allowed to contact the family (he was responsible at least for the last child's birth)\n\n\\- So clearly she picks sketchy men which further puts her kids that she can't care for at risk - while also creating more babies. Plus very doubtful a person in prison and the man who is legally forbade from contacting the family now were people with sound financial stability to help care for her previous kids and additional ones they created. If either of the parents not in prison were financially able to help her at any point - she could be getting child support.\n\n**OP also said:**  \"Abortions aren't the right choice for everybody.\"\n\n\\-So mother did have the option. Also here's an idea, adoption. There's plenty of people with adoption-agency level money who are capable of taking care of kids and pass legal/mental health/housing and financial background checks. They would all have happily and lovingly adopted the mother's kids and would have given them far better lives than they can hope for now.\n\n**If CPS is staying involved** and visiting frequently - there is likely a lot more going on:  \n\\-Can she feed all of those kids 3 meals a day?  \n\\-Do they have weather appropriate clothes that fit well enough-Is there childcare   \n\\-Is OP's mom inviting unsafe men into her kid's lives? (One in prison and one legally forbade from contacting the family, so far - not a good record).  \n\\-Is OP's mom mentally stable? Her choice in men and the situation she is in makes me highly doubt that.  \n\\-OP's mom seemed to have no issue letting OP miss school to help with bills until the school had an issue with it.  \n\\-Etc\n\n**And I'll say it louder for the people in the back - Parentification IS abuse.** And that is what is undoubtedly happening to at least OP. **And neglect can cause just as much trauma as abuse,** even if you think it \"doesn't count by definition.\" \n\n**EDIT:** This is coming from someone with parents who have lost their kids to CPS for very valid reasons", "NAH you're understandably upset and stressed out but your friend didn't contact CPS. Her parents did. She has every right to confide her feelings, concerns, and thoughts to her parents. You don't really get to tell her that she can't.", "I think your friend did the right thing.

And your childhood is being ruined by a mother that needs you to work and miss school to pay for things.", "The only ass here is your mom who keeps having kids she can't afford.", "NTA, but neither is your friend. All they did was talk to their parents.  Personally, as long as everyone is clean, fed, and doesn't mind sharing space, I don't really see why sharing a bed would be an issue.  Growing up, I knew siblings who shared a bed not because they couldn't afford a second bed, but because they just genuinely enjoyed sharing that space together.  Honestly, your friend's parents are kind TA for going straight to calling CPS on your mom without even so much as a conversation.  \n\n\nAll that to say, I am giving your mom the benefit of the doubt and I'm ASSUMING there's nothing else that would warrant a CPS call (not enough food, poor hygiene, etc.)\n\n\nAs far as the bunk beds go, you may try contacting local charity groups to see if they can help procure some donated furniture for you.  Try contacting some churches, as well, as they often have a benevolence fund they'll keep available to help people in need in their communities.  Granted, most churches have seen an increase in requests due to the pandemic and rising housing costs, but it may be worth it to make a few calls.", "The only asshole in this situation is your mum, she clearly needs some help, but to keep having so many kids in that situation is so wrong, and then you having to miss school to work? You are a child, your mum needs to practice safe sex", "NAH - your friend and her mother only have a partial picture of your life and why you live the way you do. They were honestly trying to do what\u2019s best for you but they were a bit judgemental about it because your situation is unsuitable and they wanted to fix that.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t know the consequences of their actions and what that would mean for you, so they didn\u2019t intend to add to your stresses.\n\nKeep an eye on freecycle and marketplace, second hand bunk beds come up all the time and then you\u2019d only need to make sure you got a reasonable mattress and sheets.", "NAH but OP you should not be supporting your family. How are you supposed to get an education when you are forced to be a parent? This is not a normal or good situation. It doesn\u2019t sound very stable. When you finish high school how are you supposed to go to college while supporting your family? \n\nYou need to make it clear to your mom that from now on your education comes first and supporting the family is HER job. Quit your job. College is the ladder you need to get out of this economic situation. Long term if you get a better job that would allow you to help your family more if you wanted. \n\nThe good/bad news is I doubt CPS will remove you. The bad news is that still leaves you in this situation. I think your mom should talk to a social worker to see what help she qualifies for and get it!", "And your mom just had another baby, seriously?\nSomeone needs to intervene.\n\nOP, the situation is going to keep deteriorating.\nAnd each kid having a bed doesn't sound like the only reason CPS is going to stop by so regularly.\n\nKeep in mind, what might feel normal or acceptable to you, might actually not be normal or acceptable. And you having to work to help support the household is woefully unacceptable. \n\nStruggling financially, then having 6 children crammed into a 2 bedroom, and then having another baby, just blows my mind.", "NTA - I realize she was trying to help, but there\u2019s good help and there\u2019s bad. Knee-jerk reporting your family to CPS for not having your own bed is the wrong kind, while showing up with the much needed bunk beds is good. Now you have CPS breathing down your neck and you\u2019re just trying to survive.\n\nAt the same time\u2026 you\u2019re 16 years old and having to cut class to earn more $. Education is only one half of the key to build yourself and your family a better future\u2026 and you already have the other: resilience and drive. I understand that you have way too much on your plate right now - way too much - but keep your eyes always looking to the future and your nose deep in a book. Talk to your teachers and see what they\u2019ll be willing to do to help you succeed. \n\nI understand I\u2019m an internet stranger here, but keeping an eye to the future means making decisions that won\u2019t hamper your opportunities. This means you stay away from drugs, pregnancy, and friends who want to keep you down. One foot in front of the other - you can do it.", "Why does your mom keep popping out kids???", "YTA.\n\nYour friend was trying to help. Your mother is not doing her best if she had six kids already and chose to have another baby, while you were all jammed into a 2 bedroom apartment. Where is your father in all of this?

Otherwise, you're NTA. However, the bigger issue is your mother. I don't know what her situation is, but she's not providing you and your siblings with the basic necessities.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this stress.", "YTA for what you said to your friend. Calling her that word was extremely unnecessary, and she was trying to help. You may not see it, but CPS needs to be involved at this point, at least to help your mom find resources instead of relying on her minor child. This is not a normal, nor okay situation to be in, and for gods sake, your mom needs her tubes tied because she is, i\u2019m sorry, frankly being stupid for continuing to have kids in this situation. It\u2019s irresponsible and stupid. Not a crime to be poor, but it should be to continue to have kids you can\u2019t afford.

There is nothing for child services to see in your apartment. I've never heard of a family that wasn't managing a foster care situation be ordered to separate children so everyone has their own bed.\n\nAre you sure there are no other issues being investigated? At any rate, whatever is going on here, tell your mom to call school and seek the social worker's office. Schools help parents with community services all the time. (We're obligated to at least point people in the direction of service. A social worker and a case manager can effectively help your mom navigate this maze. And the school district is obligated to attend student needs. You can't learn if you are dealing with all this stress, after all.)\n\nNTA. I can think of no reason for anyone to meddle in such a trivial domestic matter?\n\nHomeless children need child services. Kids who sleep in a bed in the apartment their mother secured for them really don't. If someone called my offices at the school district with this I would advise them that nothing codified in law here prohibits such a thing, unless a child is mistreated or in foster care.

If they were worried about your finances, why not do something to help instead of calling CPS for it? I grew up poor too and I\u2019d be livid about this. \n\nI doubt your friend was being malicious, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for yelling because all this has done is add more problems to an already difficult situation. Seems very clueless of your friend, even if she was just trying to help. \n\nIn the meantime, looking on Facebook marketplace may be helpful to find a mattress or even a futon if that would be acceptable to your CPS. Second hand mattresses aren\u2019t the most ideal but in a situation like this it may be necessary, so be sure to spray it good for bugs and keep it out of the house for a day or so.

As a mandated reporter, my regular practice has always been to let people know when and what I need to report and give them a chance to call on their own first. Your mom needed a different resource though, she'd more likely benefit from a housing subsidy and a donated bed. Not scrutiny of her parenting.

In a perfect world every one would have a bed, roof, and food for them but it's not like that.

The way you are living is appalling and your mother clearly has too many children to take care off properly. Is there a school counselor you can talk to?", "please tell your mother her vagina is not a clown car, YTA", "NAH\n\nYour friend was trying to help, but was probably unaware about how CPS (doesn\u2019t) works. \n\nYou do deserve your own bed to sleep in. That\u2019s a right you are entitled to as a human. Your mom is not able to provide that right now, and I get that, but she should\u2019ve had that sorted prior to all of this. \n\nYour situation is not the norm, so others may see it as a bad situation. \n\nAll that being said, if one of my kids came home and told me that story, I\u2019d be reaching out to your mom and asking if she needs ANYTHING. This includes the literal bed sitting dismantled in my garage right now. \n\nIt\u2019s a crap situation, but seeing as your mom doesn\u2019t have a solution, see if you can reach out to a local charity shop or resell. Oftentimes they will give people items for free when they can\u2019t afford them. Best bet is to go into a local goodwill or equivalent, and let the manager know what you need, and they can work something out with you.

Hope this all gets sorted out soon.", "I\u2019m so hating all the entitled commenters who offer nothing but judgement towards a family trying to stay together rather than solutions that help them to do so. I hope OP takes this story to a social media account that can allow her to start a go-fund me.

How will OP get any kind of decent resolution from the rabbit hole her \u201cfriend\u201d opened up for her family?", "All the people on here assuming that mom \u201cchose\u201d to have 7 kids and disparaging her. Do you folks read the paper or watch the news? Abortion is pretty much impossible in numerous states and now legislators are saying they want to eliminate birth control. Yes, abortion wasn\u2019t illegal when some of the kids were born ( and this is a gross thing to even discuss when we are talking about real children, I\u2019m sorry to even mention it), but even then it was awfully hard to gain access in a lot of states. Same for birth control. If the family is struggling for money you think that  mom had ready access to doctors and prescriptions? And don\u2019t forget about the possibility of stealthing and rape! Lots of assumptions on here. We. Don\u2019t. Know. Any of this. Please leave the mom alone, her daughter loves her and she doesn\u2019t need to hear Reddit insulting her. \n\nSweetie, NAH. I don\u2019t know for certain, but it seems unlikely your friend knew what her parents\u2019 reaction would be, or what the consequences would be if her parents reported. They probably all thought they were helping. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re in a worse spot now and that you\u2019re upset about, which is perfectly understandable! I\u2019m so sorry to hear that your life got worse. \n\nBut now what? Is there a school guidance counselor or social worker that you could ask for advice and assistance? They may be able to connect you to churches or charities or county social services that could help with a bunk bed so that your family can stay together and you can stay in school. Foster care is not the solution and I hope that\u2019s not how this ends. \n\nI\u2019m pulling for you. Can you please update us and let us know that you\u2019re ok?", "I search the comments to see if OP added any additional info but I haven\u2019t seen it so for the moment I\u2019m gonna go with no one\u2019s really an asshole. \nSounds like it\u2019s a very difficult/frustrating situation. Your friend  could have been scared for you. Concerned about your safety, concerned about your younger siblings they did the only thing they knew to do in that moment to try to get you the help-best quickest as they could. They told parents their parents, as you hopefully have the chance to do there are times when we truly don\u2019t know what to do. When we\u2019re that young we turn to the people in our circle who are supposed to help us do the things necessary to  be good people. Now obviously not taking the time to communicate that with you or have her parents come in and talk to you guys personally does seem like it could be an overstepping of the boundaries and hurtful /cruel. \n\nAs the devils advocate I will say after having worked in the public for many many years now there is something to be said for not hesitating when there could be a child could be in danger, or in an unfit/unsafe situation. They seem to have done what they  believed to be in the best interest  of you and your siblings. Maybe, just maybe, not as people trying to make a terrible situation worse but as parents, who when they empathize with you and consider that being their daughter.children, wouldn\u2019t accept a second of some thing they felt was a unfair/unsafe situation. \n\nCPS, according to you so far,  hasn\u2019t asked your family to do anything that that isn\u2019t mostly typical in families  with children on those ages all because they want to help all of you develop appropriate/safely. Not just become survivors but flourish with all the amazing potential you have. In truth, they are very overworked understaffed underfunded organization if your family gets what is asked of you they don\u2019t have the time to do continue to come up with issues or problems for your family/mother. I don\u2019t know if this has been said much, but I would definitely look into Facebook groups and marketplace, because there is potentially a cheap alternative that might have it quicker access to then buying a brand new bed.\n\nYou sound like you\u2019ve taken on some very adult size feelings and responsibilities in order to help support your family.  What are peoples opinions will be that you should listen to them putting that situation in the first place. I want to commend you for being resilient and strong and showing such love of your family that you would fight for them this way. Know  that the world does see you, your value, your strength, your beauty, and want the best for you.\n\nIt can hurt when we feel peoples choices feel like they betrayed us. You could feel like you are the reason your mom might get in trouble and/or split up your siblings. Or that\u2019s your friends at fault because you d rather have your friends be the focus when somewhere inside you have guilt  as you brought your friend over but the truth is, it\u2019s not your friends or your fault. True friendships go through some very difficult situations people grow change in mature. At 16 out of a no way to know how to approach somebody to talking about this, but it sounds like she loved you enough to not let that go and do whatever she could even if it was reckless, because she cared that much. You could help her learn how to be a better advocate for people in the future who might be in a similar situation. You could teach her how to have conversations with them, show them empathy and compassion, and put something positive and brave into the world that didn\u2019t exist for the ones whose needed it before. Maybe this will be the end of your friendship and will be a good way for both of you to learn how to amicably separate from that you care aboutD about with love/respect because that\u2019s what you both deserve. Maybe you\u2019ll remain friends and this will be a step to help build both of you in to people who can see the perspective of another person a little bit easier and with a lot more communication\n\nEdit: sorry it\u2019s late and text to speech was not cooperative", "Your mom should stop sleeping around.

We don\u2019t know how y\u2019all got to this point, if she was pregnant when you suddenly didn\u2019t have a place to stay, but if this has been going on for a while, that\u2019s incredibly cruel for your mom to put you through that. There are so many ways to not have a child. Your 16 year old daughter should not have to save up for a bunk bed with you. How are you affording food? Clothes? Doctors visits? School supplies? How is the baby getting all they need? Baby stuff is mega expensive.\n\nI think the foster system is insane, but so is having 7 children in a two-bedroom apartment. Your friend\u2019s parents most likely reported it because it is neglectful abuse. Your mom may love you a lot but this isn\u2019t healthy.

( Kinda hard to call it that, since your frustration is absolutely valid, just actions are less so - and even that makes sense, considering your age) Your friend did, what most teenagers who are on good terms with their parents, do. You don't even know if she \"reported\" you to her parents, urging them to do something - good chance is, she just answered a question of the \"how was your visit to your friend\" variety, and mentioned something she considered weird or maybe concerning. You should know yourself that one doesn't really have control over what ones parents do and how they react, so she might not even know they'd call CPS, or had a say when they decided to. (Or trusted their judgement on the situation, as authority figures in her life)\nThat said, it is as people before said - it's not your friend who landed you in this mess and there is a possibility that CPS had more complaints than just lack of beds, that you aren't aware of.

But your situation is not a good one and your mother absolutely needs to take some accountability for having so many children when she is unable to provide for them. Especially when social services have had to remove you in the past due to her becoming unwell postpartum. I do have sympathy for your mother, but she absolutely should NOT be having more children. Meeting a new man and popping out another child over and over when she lacks the resources to provide is absolutely irresponsible on her part. \n\nYes the fathers are also at fault, these men sound absolutely awful and I'm sorry your family has had such unfortunate luck when it comes to the men in your lives. \n\nThe system is also at fault. Benefits, social care, CPS etc all need funding and completely revamping. But that doesn't seem likely to happen, at least not any time soon.\n\nCan your mother not get help with child support from the fathers? Can you ask the school for any guidance on where you can access more support. Your education is important but I understand survival and the need/want to stay with your family and not end up in the system probably seems much more important to you at the moment. \n\nI'm not sure where you are based but instead of posting to reddit on AITA maybe start looking into help available to you. Look on local Facebook or neighbourhood groups for free beds, websites like free cycle, look into charities, use food banks and coupons and whatever you can to try and prevent yourself from having to work and missing out on education. \n\nYou shouldn't have to do any of this.

They were trying to help but getting child services involved is many steps too far. If they wanted to help you guys they would have helped you get a bunk bed. Next time child services shows up tell them they can't come in and to close your case. Don't open your family up for any liability, I would disengage and never open the door for them to \"help\" again. I promise you it will make your life worse engaging with them.

My older sister was also sexually abused in the foster home she went to, luckily she found an amazing adoptive family after that one ... my little sister was put into therapeutic housing , separating from me was really difficult for her because she thought of me as her mom anyways she never got an actual family not by her choice , she aged out of the system with little to no support at all , struggles with self worth and addiction . As for me I also aged out of the system with little to no support because after a few failed adoptions (me opting to leave) I decided that the group home I was in was better suited for me .
