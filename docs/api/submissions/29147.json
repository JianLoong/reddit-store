Not because of sharing a bed with your sister, but because a family of seven is shoved into a two-bedroom apartment, and your family is dependent on the earnings of a 16-year-old. I need to stress this to you: your living situation does not sound normal. That is why your friend told her parents and that is why they called CPS. If you are willing to share it, I would like to hear how your family got to this point.", "NAH.\n\nIt sounds like she really was trying to help you, the only way she knew how. A teenager who didn't grow up with poverty isn't going to have the best set of resources for that. But you aren't an asshole either for being frustrated.\n\nI think the asshole is a system that allows a family to struggle so much that a teenager has to compromise her future by skipping school to buy a place to sleep.\n\nAre you close at all to buying those bunk beds? Would it help to get an air mattress in the meantime so at least you can show social services that everyone is sleeping separately?", "NAH\n\nWhy is your mom continuing to have kids when she clearly can't care for the ones she already has?\n\nLike if she was a single mother of one or two kids and struggling -okay. But this lady is at 7 kids and still going (considering one's a baby). It's highly selfish for someone to continue having kids when they can't actually take care of them\n\nYour friend did nothing wrong - that is definitely not a healthy environment for that many kids. If you can't afford enough beds, are you all being fed as much as you should? Have clothes that you need? etc\n\nYou are also entitled to feel upset about this because of course you love your mother even if she isn't taking care of y'all the way that is required.\n\nEDIT: This is coming from someone with parents who have lost their kids to CPS for very valid reasons", "NAH you're understandably upset and stressed out but your friend didn't contact CPS. Her parents did. She has every right to confide her feelings, concerns, and thoughts to her parents. You don't really get to tell her that she can't.", "I think your friend did the right thing. Your mom clearly cannot take care of all of your siblings and they deserve better. And your childhood is being ruined by a mother that needs you to work and miss school to pay for things.", "The only ass here is your mom who keeps having kids she can't afford.", "NTA, but neither is your friend. All they did was talk to their parents.  Personally, as long as everyone is clean, fed, and doesn't mind sharing space, I don't really see why sharing a bed would be an issue.  Growing up, I knew siblings who shared a bed not because they couldn't afford a second bed, but because they just genuinely enjoyed sharing that space together.  Honestly, your friend's parents are kind TA for going straight to calling CPS on your mom without even so much as a conversation.  \n\n\nAll that to say, I am giving your mom the benefit of the doubt and I'm ASSUMING there's nothing else that would warrant a CPS call (not enough food, poor hygiene, etc.)\n\n\nAs far as the bunk beds go, you may try contacting local charity groups to see if they can help procure some donated furniture for you.  Try contacting some churches, as well, as they often have a benevolence fund they'll keep available to help people in need in their communities.  Granted, most churches have seen an increase in requests due to the pandemic and rising housing costs, but it may be worth it to make a few calls.", "The only asshole in this situation is your mum, she clearly needs some help, but to keep having so many kids in that situation is so wrong, and then you having to miss school to work? You are a child, your mum needs to practice safe sex", "NAH - your friend and her mother only have a partial picture of your life and why you live the way you do. They were honestly trying to do what\u2019s best for you but they were a bit judgemental about it because your situation is unsuitable and they wanted to fix that.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t know the consequences of their actions and what that would mean for you, so they didn\u2019t intend to add to your stresses.\n\nKeep an eye on freecycle and marketplace, second hand bunk beds come up all the time and then you\u2019d only need to make sure you got a reasonable mattress and sheets.", "NAH but OP you should not be supporting your family. How are you supposed to get an education when you are forced to be a parent? This is not a normal or good situation. It doesn\u2019t sound very stable. When you finish high school how are you supposed to go to college while supporting your family? \n\nYou need to make it clear to your mom that from now on your education comes first and supporting the family is HER job. Quit your job. College is the ladder you need to get out of this economic situation. Long term if you get a better job that would allow you to help your family more if you wanted. \n\nThe good/bad news is I doubt CPS will remove you. The bad news is that still leaves you in this situation. I think your mom should talk to a social worker to see what help she qualifies for and get it!", "And your mom just had another baby, seriously?\nSomeone needs to intervene.\n\nOP, the situation is going to keep deteriorating.\nAnd each kid having a bed doesn't sound like the only reason CPS is going to stop by so regularly.\n\nKeep in mind, what might feel normal or acceptable to you, might actually not be normal or acceptable. And you having to work to help support the household is woefully unacceptable. \n\nStruggling financially, then having 6 children crammed into a 2 bedroom, and then having another baby, just blows my mind.", "NTA - I realize she was trying to help, but there\u2019s good help and there\u2019s bad. Knee-jerk reporting your family to CPS for not having your own bed is the wrong kind, while showing up with the much needed bunk beds is good. Now you have CPS breathing down your neck and you\u2019re just trying to survive.\n\nAt the same time\u2026 you\u2019re 16 years old and having to cut class to earn more $. Education is only one half of the key to build yourself and your family a better future\u2026 and you already have the other: resilience and drive. I understand that you have way too much on your plate right now - way too much - but keep your eyes always looking to the future and your nose deep in a book. Talk to your teachers and see what they\u2019ll be willing to do to help you succeed. \n\nI understand I\u2019m an internet stranger here, but keeping an eye to the future means making decisions that won\u2019t hamper your opportunities. This means you stay away from drugs, pregnancy, and friends who want to keep you down. One foot in front of the other - you can do it.", "Why does your mom keep popping out kids???", "YTA.\n\nYour friend was trying to help. Your mother is not doing her best if she had six kids already and chose to have another baby, while you were all jammed into a 2 bedroom apartment. Where is your father in all of this?

Otherwise, you're NTA. However, the bigger issue is your mother. I don't know what her situation is, but she's not providing you and your siblings with the basic necessities.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this stress.", "YTA for what you said to your friend. Calling her that word was extremely unnecessary, and she was trying to help. You may not see it, but CPS needs to be involved at this point, at least to help your mom find resources instead of relying on her minor child. This is not a normal, nor okay situation to be in, and for gods sake, your mom needs her tubes tied because she is, i\u2019m sorry, frankly being stupid for continuing to have kids in this situation. It\u2019s irresponsible and stupid. Not a crime to be poor, but it should be to continue to have kids you can\u2019t afford.

Apparently, that girl has no experience with large families, or small incomes. Her parents didn't help you at all. They didn't even speak to you. They just made a phone call and blew your life up. \n\nNTA.

Forcing a family at poverty level into extra expense that is in turn causing you to miss school to meet their demands is ridiculous! If your friend's parents wanted to help, they could have found a good quality used bed and donated it. Ditto CPS. That would have actually been useful!

There is nothing for child services to see in your apartment. I've never heard of a family that wasn't managing a foster care situation be ordered to separate children so everyone has their own bed.\n\nAre you sure there are no other issues being investigated? At any rate, whatever is going on here, tell your mom to call school and seek the social worker's office. Schools help parents with community services all the time. (We're obligated to at least point people in the direction of service. A social worker and a case manager can effectively help your mom navigate this maze. And the school district is obligated to attend student needs. You can't learn if you are dealing with all this stress, after all.)\n\nNTA. I can think of no reason for anyone to meddle in such a trivial domestic matter?\n\nHomeless children need child services. Kids who sleep in a bed in the apartment their mother secured for them really don't. If someone called my offices at the school district with this I would advise them that nothing codified in law here prohibits such a thing, unless a child is mistreated or in foster care.

You aren\u2019t in an abusive situation for being poor, it sounds like your mom is trying her best. Your friend should have asked further questions if she was worried about your health and safety, and her parents seemed to really jump the gun. If they were worried about your finances, why not do something to help instead of calling CPS for it? I grew up poor too and I\u2019d be livid about this. \n\nI doubt your friend was being malicious, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for yelling because all this has done is add more problems to an already difficult situation. Seems very clueless of your friend, even if she was just trying to help. \n\nIn the meantime, looking on Facebook marketplace may be helpful to find a mattress or even a futon if that would be acceptable to your CPS. Second hand mattresses aren\u2019t the most ideal but in a situation like this it may be necessary, so be sure to spray it good for bugs and keep it out of the house for a day or so.

Your mom has a moral and legal obligation to take care of her children. If she can't do that, the appropriate response is to look into social services; it is NOT okay to make your teenage child sacrifice her education so she can pick up the slack.\n\nI know you love your mom a lot, and I'm sure none of you deserve this situation. It *is* abuse, though. Forcing you to give up your childhood and take on the burden of keeping your household afloat is inappropriate and abusive. I am so sorry that all the adults around you failed you in this way.\n\nThat being said... Your friend *absolutely* did the right thing. She saw you were in an unhealthy and unsafe situation and she told her parents, who told the authorities. That was the kindest, most appropriate action she could take.

In our eyes, and hers, there are 7 kids and an adult in a 2 bedroom apartment with 3-4 children in one room each, of which are likely all sharing a bed. \n\nThe issue with CPS is that, by their standards, to have living conditions is to have your own bed, these days, also your OWN room. That's why your living situation is so abnormal to your friend and why she told her parents. She wasn't trying to get CPS on your back. She likely was surprised at that and told her parents, of which then called CPS. \n\nLook. Your living situation is terrible. That's the fact. What's also a fact is your mum's choices sucked. I know you specifically told people not to talk about your mother's decisions, but, to have kids with fathers who seem to be complete jackasses and continually go and find a man to be with is a problem in itself. She likely needs therapy. \n\nAnother issue is that instead of your mum; you, a 16 yr old has full (or almost) responsibility for the finances. Which is disgusting. A 16 yr old should not have such weight on her shoulders. Im so sorry. Ultimately, i recommend you babysit the child and your mother finding a job that can pay more.

I think a lot of commenters here have no idea how many families live in poverty and what difficult choices people have to make. \n\nThe unfortunate reality is that the child welfare system is ridiculously separate from the resources available to people in poverty, so we see CPS mandating things to \"fix\" problems of scarcity, like extra appointments, that actually have the opposite impact, like missing work shifts. \nThe real problems are that housing costs are too high and work wages are too low. But I agree with others that removing children is most often an even more traumatic event than growing up poor.\nNow, I get that your friend was probably thinking her parents could help your situation. Her parents were ignorant of the realities and picked the wrong path. As someone else said, they should have talked to you or your mom first. As a mandated reporter, my regular practice has always been to let people know when and what I need to report and give them a chance to call on their own first. Your mom needed a different resource though, she'd more likely benefit from a housing subsidy and a donated bed. Not scrutiny of her parenting. Kids throughout history have shared beds and that's a pretty low risk issue. In rich families they call it bed sharing and it's a choice they make for developmental reasons, leaving perfectly good beds empty. No one is reporting them. \n\nNTA but I don't think your friend is either, just her parents.

How will OP get any kind of decent resolution from the rabbit hole her \u201cfriend\u201d opened up for her family?", "All the people on here assuming that mom \u201cchose\u201d to have 7 kids and disparaging her. Do you folks read the paper or watch the news? Abortion is pretty much impossible in numerous states and now legislators are saying they want to eliminate birth control. Yes, abortion wasn\u2019t illegal when some of the kids were born ( and this is a gross thing to even discuss when we are talking about real children, I\u2019m sorry to even mention it), but even then it was awfully hard to gain access in a lot of states. Same for birth control. If the family is struggling for money you think that  mom had ready access to doctors and prescriptions? And don\u2019t forget about the possibility of stealthing and rape! Lots of assumptions on here. We. Don\u2019t. Know. Any of this. Please leave the mom alone, her daughter loves her and she doesn\u2019t need to hear Reddit insulting her. \n\nSweetie, NAH. I don\u2019t know for certain, but it seems unlikely your friend knew what her parents\u2019 reaction would be, or what the consequences would be if her parents reported. They probably all thought they were helping. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re in a worse spot now and that you\u2019re upset about, which is perfectly understandable! I\u2019m so sorry to hear that your life got worse. \n\nBut now what? Is there a school guidance counselor or social worker that you could ask for advice and assistance? They may be able to connect you to churches or charities or county social services that could help with a bunk bed so that your family can stay together and you can stay in school. Foster care is not the solution and I hope that\u2019s not how this ends. \n\nI\u2019m pulling for you. Can you please update us and let us know that you\u2019re ok?", "I search the comments to see if OP added any additional info but I haven\u2019t seen it so for the moment I\u2019m gonna go with no one\u2019s really an asshole. \nSounds like it\u2019s a very difficult/frustrating situation. Your friend  could have been scared for you. Concerned about your safety, concerned about your younger siblings they did the only thing they knew to do in that moment to try to get you the help-best quickest as they could. They told parents their parents, as you hopefully have the chance to do there are times when we truly don\u2019t know what to do. When we\u2019re that young we turn to the people in our circle who are supposed to help us do the things necessary to  be good people. Now obviously not taking the time to communicate that with you or have her parents come in and talk to you guys personally does seem like it could be an overstepping of the boundaries and hurtful /cruel. \n\nAs the devils advocate I will say after having worked in the public for many many years now there is something to be said for not hesitating when there could be a child could be in danger, or in an unfit/unsafe situation. They seem to have done what they  believed to be in the best interest  of you and your siblings. Maybe, just maybe, not as people trying to make a terrible situation worse but as parents, who when they empathize with you and consider that being their daughter.children, wouldn\u2019t accept a second of some thing they felt was a unfair/unsafe situation. \n\nCPS, according to you so far,  hasn\u2019t asked your family to do anything that that isn\u2019t mostly typical in families  with children on those ages all because they want to help all of you develop appropriate/safely. Not just become survivors but flourish with all the amazing potential you have. In truth, they are very overworked understaffed underfunded organization if your family gets what is asked of you they don\u2019t have the time to do continue to come up with issues or problems for your family/mother. I don\u2019t know if this has been said much, but I would definitely look into Facebook groups and marketplace, because there is potentially a cheap alternative that might have it quicker access to then buying a brand new bed.\n\nYou sound like you\u2019ve taken on some very adult size feelings and responsibilities in order to help support your family.  What are peoples opinions will be that you should listen to them putting that situation in the first place. I want to commend you for being resilient and strong and showing such love of your family that you would fight for them this way. Know  that the world does see you, your value, your strength, your beauty, and want the best for you.\n\nIt can hurt when we feel peoples choices feel like they betrayed us. You could feel like you are the reason your mom might get in trouble and/or split up your siblings. Or that\u2019s your friends at fault because you d rather have your friends be the focus when somewhere inside you have guilt  as you brought your friend over but the truth is, it\u2019s not your friends or your fault. True friendships go through some very difficult situations people grow change in mature. At 16 out of a no way to know how to approach somebody to talking about this, but it sounds like she loved you enough to not let that go and do whatever she could even if it was reckless, because she cared that much. You could help her learn how to be a better advocate for people in the future who might be in a similar situation. You could teach her how to have conversations with them, show them empathy and compassion, and put something positive and brave into the world that didn\u2019t exist for the ones whose needed it before. Maybe this will be the end of your friendship and will be a good way for both of you to learn how to amicably separate from that you care aboutD about with love/respect because that\u2019s what you both deserve. Maybe you\u2019ll remain friends and this will be a step to help build both of you in to people who can see the perspective of another person a little bit easier and with a lot more communication\n\nEdit: sorry it\u2019s late and text to speech was not cooperative", "Your mom should stop sleeping around.

This is illogical and unfair, and it reeks : the idea is that people who are poor are also unfit parents in and of themselves.

I would love to say family services doesn't want to split up your family any more than you want them split up.

I don't want to see you end up in the former category. Help your mom as much as you can and try to get this bed thing sorted. I do believe you owe your friend an apology however. I seriously doubt she went to her parent and said \"OMG. You aren't going to believe how so and so lives. It's so terrible. We have to get them investigated by CPS immediately\". I'm guessing it was more along the lines of \"Gee, it's kind of weird that so and so has to share a bed with her sister. They only live in a 2 bedroom with 7 kids. Blah, blah, blah\".
