Not because of sharing a bed with your sister, but because a family of seven is shoved into a two-bedroom apartment, and your family is dependent on the earnings of a 16-year-old. I need to stress this to you: your living situation does not sound normal. That is why your friend told her parents and that is why they called CPS. If you are willing to share it, I would like to hear how your family got to this point.", "NAH.\n\nIt sounds like she really was trying to help you, the only way she knew how. A teenager who didn't grow up with poverty isn't going to have the best set of resources for that. But you aren't an asshole either for being frustrated.\n\nI think the asshole is a system that allows a family to struggle so much that a teenager has to compromise her future by skipping school to buy a place to sleep.\n\nAre you close at all to buying those bunk beds? Would it help to get an air mattress in the meantime so at least you can show social services that everyone is sleeping separately?", "NAH\n\nWhy is your mom continuing to have kids when she clearly can't care for the ones she already has?\n\nLike if she was a single mother of one or two kids and struggling -okay. But this lady is at 7 kids and still going (considering one's a baby). It's highly selfish for someone to continue having kids when they can't actually take care of them\n\nYour friend did nothing wrong - that is definitely not a healthy environment for that many kids. If you can't afford enough beds, are you all being fed as much as you should? Have clothes that you need? etc\n\nYou are also entitled to feel upset about this because of course you love your mother even if she isn't taking care of y'all the way that is required.\n\nEDIT: This is coming from someone with parents who have lost their kids to CPS for very valid reasons", "NAH you're understandably upset and stressed out but your friend didn't contact CPS. Her parents did. She has every right to confide her feelings, concerns, and thoughts to her parents. You don't really get to tell her that she can't.", "I think your friend did the right thing. Your mom clearly cannot take care of all of your siblings and they deserve better. And your childhood is being ruined by a mother that needs you to work and miss school to pay for things.", "The only ass here is your mom who keeps having kids she can't afford.", "NTA, but neither is your friend. All they did was talk to their parents.  Personally, as long as everyone is clean, fed, and doesn't mind sharing space, I don't really see why sharing a bed would be an issue.  Growing up, I knew siblings who shared a bed not because they couldn't afford a second bed, but because they just genuinely enjoyed sharing that space together.  Honestly, your friend's parents are kind TA for going straight to calling CPS on your mom without even so much as a conversation.  \n\n\nAll that to say, I am giving your mom the benefit of the doubt and I'm ASSUMING there's nothing else that would warrant a CPS call (not enough food, poor hygiene, etc.)\n\n\nAs far as the bunk beds go, you may try contacting local charity groups to see if they can help procure some donated furniture for you.  Try contacting some churches, as well, as they often have a benevolence fund they'll keep available to help people in need in their communities.  Granted, most churches have seen an increase in requests due to the pandemic and rising housing costs, but it may be worth it to make a few calls.", "The only asshole in this situation is your mum, she clearly needs some help, but to keep having so many kids in that situation is so wrong, and then you having to miss school to work? You are a child, your mum needs to practice safe sex", "NAH - your friend and her mother only have a partial picture of your life and why you live the way you do. They were honestly trying to do what\u2019s best for you but they were a bit judgemental about it because your situation is unsuitable and they wanted to fix that.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t know the consequences of their actions and what that would mean for you, so they didn\u2019t intend to add to your stresses.\n\nKeep an eye on freecycle and marketplace, second hand bunk beds come up all the time and then you\u2019d only need to make sure you got a reasonable mattress and sheets.", "NAH but OP you should not be supporting your family. How are you supposed to get an education when you are forced to be a parent? This is not a normal or good situation. It doesn\u2019t sound very stable. When you finish high school how are you supposed to go to college while supporting your family? \n\nYou need to make it clear to your mom that from now on your education comes first and supporting the family is HER job. Quit your job. College is the ladder you need to get out of this economic situation. Long term if you get a better job that would allow you to help your family more if you wanted. \n\nThe good/bad news is I doubt CPS will remove you. The bad news is that still leaves you in this situation. I think your mom should talk to a social worker to see what help she qualifies for and get it!", "And your mom just had another baby, seriously?\nSomeone needs to intervene.\n\nOP, the situation is going to keep deteriorating.\nAnd each kid having a bed doesn't sound like the only reason CPS is going to stop by so regularly.\n\nKeep in mind, what might feel normal or acceptable to you, might actually not be normal or acceptable. And you having to work to help support the household is woefully unacceptable. \n\nStruggling financially, then having 6 children crammed into a 2 bedroom, and then having another baby, just blows my mind.", "NTA - I realize she was trying to help, but there\u2019s good help and there\u2019s bad. Knee-jerk reporting your family to CPS for not having your own bed is the wrong kind, while showing up with the much needed bunk beds is good. Now you have CPS breathing down your neck and you\u2019re just trying to survive.\n\nAt the same time\u2026 you\u2019re 16 years old and having to cut class to earn more $. Education is only one half of the key to build yourself and your family a better future\u2026 and you already have the other: resilience and drive. I understand that you have way too much on your plate right now - way too much - but keep your eyes always looking to the future and your nose deep in a book. Talk to your teachers and see what they\u2019ll be willing to do to help you succeed. \n\nI understand I\u2019m an internet stranger here, but keeping an eye to the future means making decisions that won\u2019t hamper your opportunities. This means you stay away from drugs, pregnancy, and friends who want to keep you down. One foot in front of the other - you can do it.", "Why does your mom keep popping out kids???", "YTA.\n\nYour friend was trying to help. Your mother is not doing her best if she had six kids already and chose to have another baby, while you were all jammed into a 2 bedroom apartment. Where is your father in all of this?

That's a LOT.", "YTA for the way you spoke to your friend. While it may not feel like it, she was doing the right thing and didn't deserve a tirade from you. You should apologise to her. Otherwise, you're NTA. However, the bigger issue is your mother. I don't know what her situation is, but she's not providing you and your siblings with the basic necessities. That is a serious problem, and children's services do need to be involved. They will be able to connect your mother with resources to help her adequately provide for you and your siblings so you're not being forced to miss school to fill in the gaps.\n\nWhere is your father (and your siblings' fathers if you don't all have the same dad) in all this?", "NTA\n\nYou're scared so I get it. But I agree with your friend. Your mother needed the wake-up call. Why is she having kids she can't look after? Clearly she had a new baby so it's intentional. They also can't rely on you to make the money for new beds.", "First of all NTA, your mom is the AH. What your friend did was the right thing. If your mom can\u2019t support all her kids she needs to keep her legs closed. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a lot more going on though. Sorry you are going through that. This is not your fault and I commend you for you for trying to help your mom and siblings. Good luck, but sounds like the state will be stepping in soon.", "Aw man. NAH. Or E S H but I don't want to call anyone here an arsehole.\n\nAs someone else said - calling CPS is not helping, offering to buy bunk beds is. But your friend telling her parents probably was the right thing to do, so NAH from me.\n\nThis is not great though! I'm sorry you're having to deal with this stress.", "YTA for what you said to your friend. Calling her that word was extremely unnecessary, and she was trying to help. You may not see it, but CPS needs to be involved at this point, at least to help your mom find resources instead of relying on her minor child. This is not a normal, nor okay situation to be in, and for gods sake, your mom needs her tubes tied because she is, i\u2019m sorry, frankly being stupid for continuing to have kids in this situation. It\u2019s irresponsible and stupid. Not a crime to be poor, but it should be to continue to have kids you can\u2019t afford. Apologize to your friend, you don\u2019t have to continue a friendship but you said things that were undeserved.", "Wow, people are being really hard on you and your mom.

NTA, sorry you\u2019re having to work extra.", "What sucks is that you were just trying to help out a friend whise parents weren't where they were supposed to be, and she destabilized your life. You have every right to be angry. \n\nYou sound like a good, hardworking kid, trying to do the best they can for their family. Apparently, that girl has no experience with large families, or small incomes. Her parents didn't help you at all. They didn't even speak to you. They just made a phone call and blew your life up. \n\nNTA. People will disagree but you didn't ask her to solve your family's problems and you damn sure didn't ask her to make them 10 times worse.", "NTA fs\nYour friend shouldn't have assumed things without considering your situation first but also I think you should consider talking to your mom about this situation because the arrangement that you guys have isn't only inconvenient and crowded but also hugely lacks privacy required by teenagers also the fact that they're relying on a 16y/o's salary is very strange.\n\nIdrk how it works wherever you live but it's not possible for a 16y/o to work in my country (I'm also 16) and it baffles me how you have so much financial burden at such a young age", "Wow. You're nta.  Your friend may have seemed like she was helping, but I don't think she was. I think your mom is doing the best she can and now is under a lot of pressure over a bed.

Forcing a family at poverty level into extra expense that is in turn causing you to miss school to meet their demands is ridiculous! If your friend's parents wanted to help, they could have found a good quality used bed and donated it. Ditto CPS. That would have actually been useful!

There is nothing for child services to see in your apartment. I've never heard of a family that wasn't managing a foster care situation be ordered to separate children so everyone has their own bed.\n\nAre you sure there are no other issues being investigated? At any rate, whatever is going on here, tell your mom to call school and seek the social worker's office. Schools help parents with community services all the time. (We're obligated to at least point people in the direction of service. A social worker and a case manager can effectively help your mom navigate this maze. And the school district is obligated to attend student needs. You can't learn if you are dealing with all this stress, after all.)\n\nNTA. I can think of no reason for anyone to meddle in such a trivial domestic matter?\n\nHomeless children need child services. Kids who sleep in a bed in the apartment their mother secured for them really don't. If someone called my offices at the school district with this I would advise them that nothing codified in law here prohibits such a thing, unless a child is mistreated or in foster care. And different people of different socioeconomic classes still send their kids to school in the same school district.\n\n This is crazy to me.", ".", "Nah only ah is your mom", "NTA\n\nWtf was your friend thinking? You aren\u2019t in an abusive situation for being poor, it sounds like your mom is trying her best. Your friend should have asked further questions if she was worried about your health and safety, and her parents seemed to really jump the gun. If they were worried about your finances, why not do something to help instead of calling CPS for it? I grew up poor too and I\u2019d be livid about this. \n\nI doubt your friend was being malicious, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for yelling because all this has done is add more problems to an already difficult situation. Seems very clueless of your friend, even if she was just trying to help. \n\nIn the meantime, looking on Facebook marketplace may be helpful to find a mattress or even a futon if that would be acceptable to your CPS. Second hand mattresses aren\u2019t the most ideal but in a situation like this it may be necessary, so be sure to spray it good for bugs and keep it out of the house for a day or so.

Perhaps he decided to leave his family voluntarily. I say \"perhaps\" because I don't know. And neither do you. I suspect you may be one of those not the good kind of busybody I mentioned in an earlier comment. You have absolutely no idea what led to this woman and her family being in the situation they are in but you are 100% absolutely ready to throw this woman under the bus. You mentioned you had a parent have children taken away by CPS and perhaps that is clouding your vision and therefore assuming that whatever choices were made by your parent that caused them to lose custody are also the choices of this complete stranger on the internet. And, having been through this yourself, shame on you for assuming this poor woman (yes, I am defending her currently because, as I said, we don't know her situation or how she got here) is entirely at fault due to her \"poor choices\".", "Because the way OP writes suggests that this is not new, that OP is, sadly, used to it, and because her mother has a baby who is still classified as such with her.", "You\u2019re right. There are a lot of assumptions. There are 100 scenarios where mom is not an AH.\n\nMaybe her brother and SIL died and five of these kids are actually theirs and her husband died three months ago and now she\u2019s broke and pregnant and trying to figure out how to care for seven kids.\n\nMaybe she married a man who was wealthy and they could easily afford seven kids, but it turns out he was actually Bernie Madoff Jr., so their funds have been seized and he is now in jail.\n\nMaybe she had a $200k/year job but got sick with the latest pregnancy and got let go. She had a lot of savings, but her cheating ex-husband blew it all on hookers and blow.\n\nAny of those things (and a bunch of other things) are possible, but I think the assumptions come from life experience where poor decision-making is responsible for these kinds of situations far more often than really weird circumstances.\n\nIf anything like the scenarios mentioned above are true, then yes, I will be the first to admit those of us who have stated that mom is the problem are 100% wrong.", "Billions of people live in poverty.  Their reality is much more normal in this world than one in which every kid has their own bed or room. People here seem to not really know how vast swaths of people live, how poverty is not a crime and that families can still be close and happy, even with very little.", "Do you honestly believe they will have more of their needs met as wards of the state? They're housing hundreds of kids in hotels in major urban centers because they don't have enough foster placements. The kids pretty well just do what they want. \n\nYou didn't say she should be in Foster care. You said calling cps was the right move. Short of physical or sexual abuse, it's not the right call. \n\nYou're right. There is the occasional success story. Super occasional. My grandma had one of the 'good' foster homes. It didn't improve outcomes a bit because the kids had already been traumatized and milled through the system before she got them.", "My mother developed postpartum psychosis after the birth of the 4th child, and was unable to care for us for a period of time. That child's father refused to care for any child that wasn't his and with no family in a position to help, it left us needing to go into foster care while mom got help (8 months in total).", "I never said her friend is an asshole but you cannot expect a 16 year old in an extremely stressful situation to not react. \n\nThe only assholes are the mothers. Her mon for having too many kids, and the other mom should know that this was not a situation to call CPS.", "I think mines in Spain, and the other is meant to be paying and isn't", "Okay, it's not her fault my dad up and left her. Her and the second father were long split by the time he was put in prison and the third father, abuse didn't start until she was already pregnant with the youngest. She's since had a hysterectomy, so therewith be no more", "Jesus Christ, why are you so hostile?", "OP is already being punished by being parentified as a child.", "Well, OP just noted further down thread that there are three different fathers. Hers and the next split, the middle father is in jail and the third father is no contact.\n\nSo yeah, shitty choices.", "Using the excuse that others have it worse is trivializing and quite stupid actually. This teenage girl is working to support her mother and siblings, which is parentification, and is considered abuse. No one said poverty is a crime. But continuing to have children while not being able to provide them basic necessities without their labour is a major problem. The mother is failing here because her teenage daughter is required to work in order to provide for the rest of the family.", "It\u2019s not the right call? A young girl is having to give up her schooling in order to help her mom take care of her siblings. That\u2019s completely unacceptable. And once the younger ones are old enough to work, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll be forced into labour as well \u201cfor the family.\u201d\n\nCPS was absolutely the right call.", "Oh my god, this keeps getting worse. So your mother developed postpartum psychosis after Child 4, and she *kept getting pregnant after that*? Three more kids!?", "And what is being done to make either father pay?", "[deleted]", "So\u2026 the solution is to make it worse. Parentify her more to pay for beds, or break up a family and put them into the stellar and completely non abusive foster care system..\n\nThat will teach OP to not be born poor.", "She\u2019s working more shifts BECAUSE of CPS.  Here, CPS was called and the result is it made things worse.  NTA", "She only skipped school because CPS showed up and started making demands! Otherwise, her ass would have been at school!", "Yeah, clearly I hit a nerve.", "No. Her mother should be working extra shifts and insisting she goes to school. She should be trying to find a cheap or free extra bed. She should absolutely not be relying on a 16 year old to support her family. If she can\u2019t raise them she should give them up. This is not the fault of CPS or the friend. This is the mother being an incompetent mother.", "We don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t believe cramming 7 kids in a two bedroom apartment is healthy and I agree with other commenters that there\u2019s probably more going on. The 16 year old is protective of her mom because she\u2019s been parentified and likely told for years that her responsibility is to her family. That doesn\u2019t make it right. The kids deserve better.\n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t mention where her older sibling is. My guess is moved out and low to no contact.", "Poverty sucks.  CPS doesn\u2019t make it better.", "Mom is caring for the other children.  You\u2019re wanting her to neglect them isn\u2019t helpful.", "The kids aren't going to get better. Especially from CPS. But they absolutely can get worse.", "I disagree. Clearly you have a thing with CPS but I believe the kids will get much worse in their current situation.", "I don't know what you have against cps, but you need to get over it. My nephew wouldn't be alive right now if it wasn't for cps. My nephew and niece are in a much better place after cps came in."]}
