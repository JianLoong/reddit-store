What they did was not only rude but was sacrilegious. FYI I'm an atheist and even I think this is beyond messed up.", "NTA. \n\nPaying rent entitles them to live there and nothing more. They aren\u2019t entitled to sleep in her bed or eat her food just because they pay rent. She has every right to wanting her property to be handled according to her wishes. If they\u2019re not going to respect her property then they should buy their own.", "No roommate is entitled to another's things. Do Jay and Kai also get to wear her clothes? NTA.", "NTA at all.. they\u2019re being incredibly disrespectful to her religious practices. she was kind enough to let them use her utensils as long as they kept things separate, but they didn\u2019t. now they don\u2019t get to use them. \n\nplus she paid for them herself and they are not entitled to a single thing they\u2019re not paying for.", "NTA - If Lea bought the utensils she can do whatever she wants with them.", "NTA - they can buy their own pots, pans, Dishes etc... Rent only entitles them to use the space that is being rented not what others own in that space. they need to learn to respect Lea in general a long with her religion. Or they can move out.", "Lea is NTA. The roommates sound like the worst kind of assholes.\n\nWhat the roommates did was fucked up and extremely disrespectful of Lea and her religious beliefs. The rules about kashrut (keeping kosher) can be confusing and can seem nonsensical to people who aren't familiar with them. But they matter a lot to the people who follow them, and it's easy enough to follow simple instructions, especially if things are labeled! (I know this from experience: some members of my family keep kosher. I don't, but I respect them, and I do my best to use their things correctly when I visit their homes. If I'm not sure about something, I always ask.)\n\nThe roommates have a right to use their shared kitchen, but they definitely don't have a right to use Lea's pots, pans, knives, etc. It was kind and generous of Lea to offer them the use of her kitchen equipment and clearly label things so they knew what could be used for what food. If they don't like her rules for using her property, they can get their own and use it however they like.\n\nAlso: it sounds like the roommates went out of their way to disrespect Lea and her religious practices. That's upsetting. Of course, honest mistakes can happen when you're trying to navigate unfamiliar rules-- it's easy to imagine someone accidentally cooking bacon in a meat pan because they don't know that bacon isn't a kosher meat. But cooking meat in a pan clearly labeled \"dairy\" isn't a mistake. The roommates really owe Lea an apology.", "The flatmates can go and f themselves with their non existent utensils. Tell her to keep them locked and sooner or later they will buy their own", "Tell Lea she is NTA. \n\nHer roommates have entitlement issues. They can buy their own utensils, just like Lea did.", "NTA, but Lea might be wise to get roommates who keep kosher as well, or who at least understand why it's important to her.\n\nI mean, as a nonreligious person, I don't really get why you can't wash a utensil you used for dairy and then use it for meat, but it does matter to some people. And there are people who simply will never get that.", "NTA, paying rent gives them access to the home and shared areas, not the utensils.\n\nIf it is clear they cannot respect her wishes on how to use the utensils, she has every right to lock them...", "NTA\n\nPaying rent does not give anyone the right to contaminate another roommate's kitchenware.  This same rule applies for religious purposes, for personal choices (vegan etc.), and for those with allergies.  Heck, it even applies to someone saying, don't use my things, for no other reason at all.", "NTA.  They are personal property not communal items or items which are part of the lease.  As for these flatmates parents getting involved- it is none of their business.  She is best locking up her items.", "I understand the keeping kosher and the keeping meat and dairy separate. I'm not Jewish but I understand the religion and the beliefs. Saying that  she bought the stuff they're her property. Just cause the other 2 and their parents don't want to buy their own kitchen stuff that's on them. The only way it would be different is if it came with the apartment and is part of the lease. If anything so it's not in a common area store them in her room.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA I just used a site to create a lease agreement. Unless you specified use of kitchen utensils, it's not included and they can suck it. \n\nNow let's move on to what AHs they are.", "NTA\n\nThe rules were pretty simple (and the labels are there, it's not like color coding where one might genuinely make a mistake because of confusing \"is blue meat or dairy?\"). These are utensils and cookware that she'd purchased for herself to comply with her religious practice (even if she is not otherwise observant). Disrespecting the very simple request \"don't use my things if you cannot follow the practice\" by cooking bacon  (!) in a dairy pan seems to be the sort of thing that can only be deliberate ... and that is definitely AH territory.\n\nPaying rent entitles them to the roof over their head, use of the bathroom, kitchen facilities--the fridge, stove, sink, dishwasher, and common areas. Nothing more.", "NTA, they can get their own utensils at Target, Walmart, or Amazon. It was disrespectful to not follow her guidance.", "NTA. They wouldn't use her toothbrush because it came with the house. The utensils are hers. She offered them for use with a few simple rules. They ignored the rules because they assumed she'd never know, and in doing so, made a mockery of her religion. Not cool.", "NTA. \n\nand this sounds so fake. I knew a few people in college who followed kosher cooking practices. At most this just attracted curious questions, most often just a shrug or a dismissive comment of \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d. But exactly no one gave these people any shit about it. I could definitely see a lazy, dismissive roommate breaking the rules, but they couldn\u2019t really complain if locking up her shit was the response. \n\nI had a roommate steal from me once. My response was to put a lock on my door. They never whined about the lock. Why on earth would they??!?", "Life\u2019s too short for this petty BS.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was entirely foreseeable what was coming when she allowed them to use the pans to begin with and established the policy.  That never goes well.  Nevertheless, there is no need for that to continue.  Under these circumstances, she really has no option other than to shrug and ignore them from here on.  Eventually -- eventually -- they will get tired of carrying on and having no cooked meals and buy their own equipment.

Far more likely is that they're A) just being lazy; B) too cheap to buy their own kitchen items; and C) don't really understand/see the point in kosher laws. The last one is the worst of them since it's disrespectful of the person's beliefs, but it still doesn't make it a hate crime.", "Yeah it pretty much is a hate crime, but no DA will ever prosecute.
