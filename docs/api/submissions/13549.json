My aunt and uncle gave their son the more traditional name of James, but decided from the time he was born to call him Jamie, which is more frequently used as a girl's name. By the time he was a teenager, he had begun introducing himself to classmates by his full name, and he eventually told his parents that's what he wanted to be called. They came unglued because they thought he was being disrespectful toward a nickname they had chosen for him out of love. My mom told my aunt that she and my uncle were the ones being disrespectful because they refused to acknowledge what he wanted to be called. We all call him James now. Your name is your identity, and I believe that you should be able to decide for yourself whether you want to be called by your full name or a nickname even if you're still a kid.

Youngest is just 2yo and don't talk (we have speech therapy, don't worry) so he has no opinion yet ;) I had to asked one teacher  not to use nickname because my son doesn't like it but is afraid to tell her that. As a parent, I have to make sure my kids requests about his name and identity are respected. If they want to change their names they are free to do it when they are 18.

I almost changed it at 18. I never use it! It's something I resent, and I guarantee you her kid will too.\n\nShe needs to understand this is a serious thing and not about her own tastes or esthetics.

Same thing with my boss, he has a 9 letter name with a very common shortened version that he doesn't like being called. You never know.\n\nI say your sister isn't an AH, but she asked a question and needs to accept whatever the response is.

I would never have envisioned a kid named James--with all the available nicknames already associated with that--feeling a need to rename himself \"Sky.\"", "Cool factor has definitely been a big thing in my experience. Most kids with the more common classic or old fashioned names want something cooler. Or prettier. Some go for the really soft cutesy nicknames.", "I intended to call my son Will, but I call him William.  The shorter nickname is growing on him, because I think most people tend to assume a 7 year old is not a William, but he used to correct people who called him Will.", "Yeah, both of my kids go by nicknames with their friends and their 'real' names as home. Super common - my own husband is referred to by his full name by his family, but a nickname with literally everyone else, which always throws me off when we're with his family and I'm not sure for a second who the hell they are talking about when they use his 'real' name.\n\nParents who try and enforce what happens with their kids name at school are really fighting a losing battle.", "I can understand that. I've had some names go on a never use list for me because of reasons of teaching. Not always the kids either. Some of the crazy parents can ruin a nice name.", "I like my name and don't consider it bad at all.", "Other teachers I know, in different schools, have said similar things. But I know some who have the same experiences as me too. I think a lot of it varies and culture overall can play a huge role in it. It really is fascinating to try and figure out where the differences come in.\n\nI do suspect in some of the cases with my kids, part of it could be parents who hate and refuse to use any nickname (I've had some enraged parents tell me to call their kid by the name they gave them).", "No; it\u2019s Jamie Fraser from Outlander.", "Not a fan of Diana Gabaldon?", "Not really.  Not every name has to be some new trendy one.\n\nAnd, don't assume everybody like to forget history, or agrees with your views.", "> probably the same song tbh\n\nOther possible names that are strongly associated with a 30+ year old song and not much else:\nJolene, Cecilia, Caroline, Billie Jean, Barbara Ann, Rhonda, Sharona", "\ud83d\ude2d", "Boring is the word he used for James when he was talking to his friends lol. I can't remember the reason for Lydia. That was a few years ago now. I think she wasn't fond of the relative she was named after or something. But I sure do hear some funny things about names. One that made me laugh really hard was a kid who talked about his brother (Ben) and how the name was so boring his grandpa fell asleep every time he heard it lol.", "Honestly, after a decade of teaching, I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up child free if I don't quit my job soon. \ud83e\udd23", "That's fine. I'm sure there are plenty of people named Karen who feel fine about their name. That doesn't change the fact that socially it's become a meme.\n\nThere was a post on this sub about a relative naming their baby Karen and how it didn't go well. So your sister is correct in feeling like a modern meme name wouldn't suit her child best.\n\nThere are \"classic\" names with good nicknames though, so I don't think her choice of an older name is actually an issue.", "Then you have kids like me, who were given typical modern names (Jennifer, Amanda, not unusual) and hated them anyway so insisted on nicknames. There\u2019s really no predicting how it\u2019s going to go.", "Jenny had a good run there as well with 867-5309, Forrest Gump and Jenny from the Block.", "I was thinking Eileen.", "I have a sister named Cecilia who was born in 1969.  She hated that song so much\u2026", "they're talking about the spelling Jaime/Jaimee here, not Jamie", "Oh yeah, Come On Eileen was definitely what I interrupted Cheerfulmint aunt's name to be, but hello_theydies could have been talking about a different song that their cousin was named for. Cheerfulmint said something like \"probably the same song\" and I was pointing out that it could have been any number of other names.", "What's a modern nickname for Judith?", "There isn't one I can think of honestly. I haven't had a Judith in school yet. My guess would be Jude as someone suggested could get used, or something unrelated entirely."]}
