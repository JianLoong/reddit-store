My aunt and uncle gave their son the more traditional name of James, but decided from the time he was born to call him Jamie, which is more frequently used as a girl's name. By the time he was a teenager, he had begun introducing himself to classmates by his full name, and he eventually told his parents that's what he wanted to be called. They came unglued because they thought he was being disrespectful toward a nickname they had chosen for him out of love. My mom told my aunt that she and my uncle were the ones being disrespectful because they refused to acknowledge what he wanted to be called. We all call him James now. Your name is your identity, and I believe that you should be able to decide for yourself whether you want to be called by your full name or a nickname even if you're still a kid.

Youngest is just 2yo and don't talk (we have speech therapy, don't worry) so he has no opinion yet ;) I had to asked one teacher  not to use nickname because my son doesn't like it but is afraid to tell her that. As a parent, I have to make sure my kids requests about his name and identity are respected. If they want to change their names they are free to do it when they are 18.

I almost changed it at 18. I never use it! It's something I resent, and I guarantee you her kid will too.\n\nShe needs to understand this is a serious thing and not about her own tastes or esthetics.

Same thing with my boss, he has a 9 letter name with a very common shortened version that he doesn't like being called. You never know.\n\nI say your sister isn't an AH, but she asked a question and needs to accept whatever the response is.
