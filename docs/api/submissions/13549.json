She argued against that. But he said he doesn't think any child would use those full names in school or with friends. She said they're beautiful and look at how many Elizabeth's and Charles' there are in the world who are young and only use the full name.\n\nSo she decided to ask me what my experience was with kids. And I told her that in the classes I have taught, none of the kids with classic or old fashioned names go by the full older name. They all go with a more modern nickname.

She asked what happens if we use their full name and I told her I always respect what my kids want to be called and so does my girlfriend.\n\nMy sister went a little crazy on me and said just because I don't like the names doesn't mean I should discourage others from using them. I reminded her that SHE asked ME about my experience, that I did not offer it out of nowhere. She told me my snarky little comment about modern nicknames was enough.

My aunt and uncle gave their son the more traditional name of James, but decided from the time he was born to call him Jamie, which is more frequently used as a girl's name. By the time he was a teenager, he had begun introducing himself to classmates by his full name, and he eventually told his parents that's what he wanted to be called. They came unglued because they thought he was being disrespectful toward a nickname they had chosen for him out of love. My mom told my aunt that she and my uncle were the ones being disrespectful because they refused to acknowledge what he wanted to be called. We all call him James now. Your name is your identity, and I believe that you should be able to decide for yourself whether you want to be called by your full name or a nickname even if you're still a kid. It would show tremendous disrespect for a parent to insist on calling their child one thing when the child wants to be called something else, unless the kid is in trouble and Mom pulls out the First, Middle, and Last treatment!", "NTA\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answer to\u201d, if she wanted an echo chamber she should\u2019ve asked that before asking her ridiculous question\n\nYou and your gf do right by the kids, calling them what they request\u2026 my son likes to be called Char (yes, short for Charizard) at school because in the past there were multiple kids with his name in his class. I can\u2019t stand it, but everyone at school respects his request and calls him Char\u2026\n\nYour sis will have to learn that she\u2019s cooking a little human inside of her, that that little human will want things different from her and she will need to accept that", "What's in a name? That which we call an asshole\n\nBy any other name would smell just as shitty.\n\n**NTA**", "NTA - She asked you a question and you answered. Sounds like this was a no win situation for you though.", "Nta. I am hoping she's just a little... Extra emotional due to the pregnancy. But you did nothing wrong, you just answered her questions honestly and fully.", "NTA\n\n\nShe asked. You answered. Maybe she is a little emotional because of the pregnancy or it might be because it is 3 against one at this point. And you didn\u2019t discourage her from naming her kid any particular name. You just told her that kids usually shorten their names if they tend to have the said names. \n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your opinion. It was something that you and your girlfriend see happening.", "NTA.  She asked and you answered in a neutral way.  She doesn\u2019t want to hear what you are telling her.  She obviously loves her preferred name choices and wants everyone else to love them, too. That\u2019s just not realistic.  She should consider choosing an old fashioned name that still has a nickname option she likes, that way all her bases are covered.", "NTA.\n\nFrom what I gather you weren't discouraging her, you were simply talking about your experience. There's nothing wrong with (most) old-fashioned names, but to kids these days, that's what they feel like: old. Nicknaming is natural and not really something she can control right now.", "INFO: When you say they use nicknames, are these generally derived from their legal name? I.e. Liz for Elizabeth, Meg for Margaret, Charlie for Charles or Don for Donald? Or is Albert going by Tank and Judith by Bird?", "NTA, but you are forgetting one thing, they are not naming just kid, but the adult the kid will grow into. Name for a kid is just fleeting time of their life unless they decide to change the name they will use the name as adult way longer.", "NTA. Sounds like her pregnancy hormones might be leading her reactions a bit.

It just didn't fit with what she wanted to hear. Also I'm a school teacher as well. While I haven't gotten too many old names over the years, the ones that did, I'd say about half use a nickname. I also try to respect what they ask to be called, which I can relate to because I go by my middle name throughout life. The only people who use my first name are bill collectors and government agencies.", "NTA, you are just relaying information. Which i agree with. I work in health care and meet thousands of new people every month. I recognize that trend of the old names and think, Well that's been done. Those names are so. So. So overdone and they usually represent someone from history who we'd all rather forget. Elizabeth and all the derivatives of it. Ellie Elle Ella Eliz Eliza Liza Lise Lisa Lisbeth Beth Bethany Betty Bette = OVERDONE! There are unique and interesting names from history if they are digging.", "NTA. She knew the answer but didn't want to hear it. It is her problem. \n\nAs a mother of 4 boys with \"weird names\" that are very uncommon in Poland, all I can say - I have no power over how my kids want to be called when they go to school. The oldest prefers nickname that we all use. One of the twins likes all sorts of nicknames, and the other twin prefers full name. Youngest is just 2yo and don't talk (we have speech therapy, don't worry) so he has no opinion yet ;) I had to asked one teacher  not to use nickname because my son doesn't like it but is afraid to tell her that. As a parent, I have to make sure my kids requests about his name and identity are respected. If they want to change their names they are free to do it when they are 18. I had my name changed when I was 11. My friend changed her at 25yo.", "NTA - She asked and did not get the answer she wanted, or expected you to just agree with her. I had a neighbor growing up who named her daughters Eloise and Elanor. As the girls grew up, they resented their names because they were \"old fashion\". They are in the mid to late 20s now and the relationship with their mother is not great.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Same with trendy names. She was named by our dad and got a vintage name. Whereas my sister and I were named by our mom and got modern names.

I do see a lot more nature and word themed nicknames/chosen names though. Lydia who goes by Lyric for example. James who goes by Sky. You also have names like Rosemary where Rosie is used. Declan and Desmond are a couple I have seen more recently and those boys went by Dex.", "Do you think that Bowie, Red, and Asher would use those nicknames even if they had the most modern names?", "Oh yeah, it was definitely off topic lol.\n\nNo you\u2019re NTA.", "Ah, that\u2019s a shame, I think I\u2019d be very pleased to meet an Uwu.", "The kids in question who I know, no, I don't think they would. In my experience the ones with more modern names might shorten it but not really change it as much as the ones with more classic/old fashioned names. There also doesn't really seem to be much of a style difference in the nicknames for modern names. But I also think it depends too. The names that I see a lot of where I teach are different than names some teacher friends see a lot of. I normally have a mix between modern and classic with a slight leaning toward the classic names in my classroom every year."]}
