I know that my cleaning service is bonded and insured, so if they break anything or, worse, get injured somehow on my property, I don't have to worry about it. Obviously your MIL won't have that.\n\nThat said, could she be worried about money? Do you pay her for babysitting?", "NAH. There is nothing wrong with her proposing this, but you\u2019re wise to turn it down. \n\nFirst, money/business and family rarely mix well. If there were a problem with a stranger you hire, you should be able to deal with it easily. However, with her it won\u2019t be that simple. \n\nSecondly, good boundaries are very important for relationships with in-laws. If she\u2019s literally has free run of your house all the time and can be going through your stuff, I can see that being a hell of a can of worms. \n\nDon\u2019t do it.", "NAH. It\u2019s a nice offer, but it\u2019s wise to not hire her. It could go so wrong in so many ways.", "Money and friends/family shouldn't mix, IMHO.  \n\nNTA to say no and hire a professional.", "NAH, but it sounds like you should start paying her for the babysitting.", "Nah, I did this with my mom and it backfired so badly. I tried to have a set day and amount of time but she would just come over at random clean and demand more money then agreed. Then she started mocking my housekeeping skills and calling my husband a slob. Then she started snooping. Mind you this happened over the span of 3months while my hand was broken and I was dealing with nerve damage. We where struggling to keep up with the house. Shit can hit the fan fast.", "NTA! Aside from employing family, which has a litany of drawbacks, giving your MIL full access to your house is an invitation for disaster. The more access she has, the more she will think whatever she sees/finds is her business. Set boundaries and stick to them.", "Just me. But the LAST person I would want to clean my house would be my MIL. Would snoop into everything.", "NTA, but if your MIL needs money, maybe find another way to help her out.", "NAH but I too would feel uncomfortable having a family member do that for me.  \n\nCould you set her up for a weekly paid, standing babysitting appointment?  Even if it's just an afternoon once a week or so?", "NTA. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable having her clean, maybe you could start paying her to watch your kiddos instead?\nI pay my mom to watch my son and also clean my house. When I suggested hiring someone to clean, my husband was the first to mention my mom. BUT we have no problem with my mom cleaning and organizing our stuff. We see it as \u201cwe\u2019re all adults\u201d.", "I wouldn't want my family going through my stuff during a cleaning cycle.   Sometimes it's better to have an outsider.  NTA", "NAH - she\u2019s not the AH for asking, but quickly will become one if she insists.  But you\u2019re clearly within your rights to want this boundary.", "NTA - these ideas sound good but rarely end well. You and your MIL would have to accept you would become her boss. She would probably be great in general but there is guaranteed to be some disagreements.", "NTA\n\nYour concerns are justified, this dynamic is going to cause trouble no matter how careful you are.\nYour MIL working as your cleaning lady means she works for you, it's like you and your husband are her bosses, she's his mother, asking her to clean something or redo another is just gonna be super awkward, it will install a sense of superiority between the three of you no matter how you behave still I don't think you refusing the idea will ho well with her, she will probably be offended even if you tried to explain why this option isn't possible, so you better be prepared for drama.", "Have a conversation with your MIL, is she really hurting for money, or is she just feeling stressed about food costs/utilities.    If you want to help her without her feeling like a charity case, get her a fox subscription for Christmas or her birthday.   Like Hello Fresh or Blue Apron or whatever is in your area.   Yes, it will cost you money over time, but it will help her out, it is a gift so she doesn\u2019t feel bad about receiving it.   And yeah, pay her sometimes for babysitting.   If she had the kid for overnight, deliver the kid along with a bag of groceries.  Or a gift card for the book store or her favorite place. \n\nMy sister wants to hire someone to clean for her once a week.  She wanted to hire a friend who she knows needs money.   I pointed out that this person is extremely overbearing and at one time when they were closer friends, she constantly found fault with my sister and her home.  Sister didn\u2019t need to much stuff/why did she buy this or that/the furniture should be arranged this way, etc.  they reconnected recently which is why sister thought about her.  But the friend has gone down the rabbit hole of tender and admitted to some dubious activities with strangers and on line.   At lunch the woman could not put her phone down and was communicating with several different men.   I suggested to sister that IF she really wanted the help from friend, to make it just the main floor of the house, and tell her how much for the job to be done, not by the hour because if she couldn\u2019t put her phone down, she would clean for 2 hours but spend 5 there texting.    \n\nHire an outside cleaning service.   Business and impersonal.", "NTA-  Just say to MIL- I hear what you're saying but it won't work.  Frankly, I'm all the time accusing my housekeepers of stealing things I can't find. Sometimes I find things, sometimes I never do, which makes me wonder.  So a little bit I always hate them.  It would be entirely too complicated for you to take that role.", "NTA, but if you can afford it maybe start paying her for babysitting or something?", "NTA. You don\u2019t want MIL cleaning your house. Even if you have a great relationship, she\u2019s going to tell people that she has to clean up after you. And you\u2019re going to have to hide your \u201cfun stuff,\u201d really, really well.", "NTA, you want to keep that great relationship!\n\nBut I think you should be paying her for babysitting.", "NTA, it'll Definitely change the dynamic. Plus personally I would feel weird if my MIL is going through my drawers and undergarments lol. Also working with family always has a chance to turn out bad.", "NTA. In general, mixing family and money/business often ends poorly. Plus, it's not like she's a professional or something.", "NTA. Hiring family almost never ends up working out well for one reason or another. You are looking for someone to help relieve stress not add to it. Can you be sure if you hire her that won\u2019t end up being the case? I get along great with my extended family and in-laws too, but I still wouldn\u2019t take the risk.", "NAH \n\nWhen I was a student and my BF earned good money already - he paid me for cleaning his Appartement which we practically shared - he said if he was single he would pay for a cleaning lady - I like cleaning and didn\u2019t mind to clean his flat in which I stayed 90% of the time anyway loved it that he valued my work \n\nSo now helping out your MiL like this is a good idea - petter keep the money in the family and as you would probably pay her under the table you can pay her more than she would earn working for a cleaning service", "NTA. its a bad idea when family and business (any type) mix. if its a stranger, you can let them go if they do a bad job or be stern with them. you cant do with your MIL. get a stranger to do the cleaning.\n\nalso, if she is such a need of money have a conversation with MIL to see what is troubling her.", "NTA its reasonable that youre not comfortable. Money & family dont usually mesh well. & i dont know about you, but i'd constantly be wondering if she was seeing things i'd rather she didnt see. If she says she could use the money, check in with her to make sure she doesnt feel taken advantage if with babysitting. Im not implying you are, its just a courteous thing to do.", "NTA . Personally I'd hate having MIL cleaning my private space. It's just asking for trouble.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a bad idea.", "NAH why does she need the money? I think you need to talk to her about her money situation. Either hire her and if not ask your husband about gifting her money", "NTA.  I would totally agree for this with my MIL. But she is an amazing person and would do a wonderful job. You could also have very specific rules about what you want cleaned.  She stays out of your bedroom for example.  You could also suggest to recommend her to friends as a cleaner too if she needs the money.", "NTA -- I think you should politely say that you don't think it's a good idea for your relationship, because bringing an employer-employee dynamic could make things uncomfortable. But offer to recommend her services to your friends if she's setting up a business.\n\nOr just say you're happy with the service you already have. (Act like it's a done deal.)\n\nDO NOT HIRE HER. Hiring cleaning people is an intimate business and it would mess with your head and your dynamic even if she's the sweetest MIL in the world.\n\n(I agree with everyone else who says pay her for babysitting instead)", "NAH but a word of advice - don't hire your MIL. You aren't just paying for cleaning, you are paying for confidentiality - do you really want your MIL to have access to all your \"dirty\" secrets? Don't hire her to clean your home - if she needs money and you have a good enough relationship/can afford it see if you can do something else - a babysitting fee would probably work well too.", "No NTA for not wanting to hire her as a maid, but if your MIL could use the money and she\u2019s working for you as a babysitter and you can afford it maybe just offer to pay her for the babysitting. If she\u2019s a good grandma there\u2019s no better nanny in the world, and then everyone wins", "Why are you comfortable with letting her babysit and not clean?", "NTA.\n\nThis a great big box of nope. Tell MIL that you're very grateful for her offer, but it's just too much to ask. Tell her how guilty you'd feel if she had to clean up after you. \n\nThen quietly hire someone and keep that information to yourself.", "Just tell her that it's the kind of situation that can lead to misunderstanding or conflict (even when everyone involved has the best of intentions), and you really really don't want to risk the healthy family relationship that you have now (which is true, right?).\n\nMaybe you could help her look around for cleaning gigs, it can be good money with flexible hours.", "NAH She can offer I guess. But you absolutely can and should feel free to turn her down. My own mom is a house cleaner. That is her job. I would never pay her to clean my home. It is weird. My mom is not my servant and I feel like it becomes weird when a person you know so well has complete access to your home, too intimate, versus a professional with no personal attachment to you who is just cleaning and not judging.", "IF you do hire her, make sure all your private papers are locked up and secure.  Anything you do t want her to see or know about, lock it up.", "If grandma needs some extra money though, maybe it's time to consider paying her for babysitting- especially for longer stretches like an entire ped day.", "This is what I thought. \nBoth the , are you prepared on what she might look through and what if you want to stop having the service and has to \"fire\" her. \n\nI'd add in. If you hire a professional. They will just clean, and that's it. \nYour mother in law.... there are chances she might comment on what she cleans.

I'd never have thought of that!\nAn outsider would NEVER make any comment regarding your house cleanliness or the way you live. Even if your mom was joking , i would be upset about that situation as well.  \n\nI do understand now why it could be a delicate situation and that having a professional not related to you is the way to go\n\nETA : An employee would never complain about the day you picked or the time they have to spend. They are professionals , it's their job. I can see how a family member would try to change the date/time, thinking you'd be understanding", "Have her over for some meals and send back left overs. Food is expensive now.", "VERY good suggestion"]}
