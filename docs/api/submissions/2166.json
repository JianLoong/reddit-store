My husband (M38) is home with our two kids (M5 and M2).  We have a part-time babysitter who steps in more full time when I have to be out of town and my sister who lives close by. The babysitter uses our car to drop the kids at school in the morning while my husband takes the public transportation to work. \n\nA few nights ago, while I was talking to my husband, he said that the car was out of gas and that he needed to fill it up so that the babysitter had enough gas to get the kids to school. He said they wouldn\u2019t have time as they are always running behind in the morning and there wasn\u2019t enough gas in the car to get them to school. He said he was going to wait until the kids were asleep and then leave to go get the gas. I told him to wait until the morning and wake up early to ask my sister to stay for a few minutes while he got the gas, that I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him leaving two toddlers alone in the house even if they are asleep. He said he might do it but he heard and understood my concern. \n\nThe next morning he said he went and left them alone for 20 minutes around midnight. He said it was fine bc they didn\u2019t wake up. I am livid. One I asked him not to do it and 2 just bc nothing went wrong this time, I don\u2019t want it to become a habit and then something goes wrong (kids wake up screaming and traumatized bc they can\u2019t find a parent esp bc I\u2019m already gone, they walk out into the street at night looking for us (we don\u2019t have a front gate and the older one knows how to use the child lock, but is very responsible about asking for permission before going outside. Not sure what he\u2019d do with no adult and if he\u2019s panicking and frankly, don\u2019t want to find out)). \n\nI know it\u2019s hard with one parent especially when the other gone bc routines get disrupted and there\u2019s not as many people to do things, plus I get that he was trying to make things easy for the baby sitter, I just feel like there were better options and I\u2019m starting to feel like I don\u2019t trust him to exhibit good judgement caring for our kids when I\u2019m not there. He says I\u2019m overreacting and being the AH for not letting this go.  Am I being an AH for demanding that he agrees not to do it again until an age we agree they are old enough?", "created_utc": 1668291150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytjxp2/aita_for_demanding_my_husband_not_leave_our/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband can pack them in the car when they're awake and go to the gas station like every single parent manages to do.\n\nIt's dangerous and the authorities really frown on it. Your husband needs to get his head on straight.", "**NTA**\n\nAt all. What your husband did was INCREDIBLY dangerous. It only takes seconds for a fire to start if there was a short in the wiring and minutes for a whole house to go up in flames. What if one of them got up and went looking for you and fell on the stairs? Or hit their head on something? Or turned on the stove?\n\nWorse yet - and this is a true story - I once was driving home from work and found my neighbours'  2-year-old son wandering 3 blocks from home, about to walk onto a poorly fenced construction site. He was barefoot only wearing a t-shirt and diaper. The whole family had been napping on a Saturday afternoon and they thought he didn't know how to open the front door lock by himself. THEY WERE WRONG. His mother wept when I brought him home, saying thank God I was the one who found him (he didn't know me well but I was a daycare teacher and knew how to get down to his level and coax him to come with me) and not a predator. He could have been hit by a car, or hurt on that construction site going to \"look at the building machines\". As you said, what if one of your kids woke and went looking for you in the middle of the night. A child as small as 2 or 5 would barely be visible to motorists and, half-asleep, could easily wander into the road. \n\nYour husband was FRIGHTENINGLY irresponsible. The worst thing that would have happened if he waited until morning was they would have been a bit late for school. Children that young should never ever be left home alone. Not for 20 minutes, not for 10 minutes. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, but he needs to understand this better. There is a reason why it is illegal to leave young children alone.", "NTA not only was what your husband did stupid but was also illegal, had he been caught you could have come home to your children in foster care. What if he had have been in a car accident or something.", "NTA.  \n\nThe risk isn't \"what if something happens during the 20 minutes\".  Your husband is right.  They won't wake up and even if they did, they're not going to be out wandering the streets when he gets back. \n\nThe risk is \"what if it's not 20 minutes\".  What if he got in a car accident or got a flat tire or any of a hundred things that wouldn't be his fault but could stretch that 20 minutes into several hours", "NTA, that's neglectful and illegal in many places.", "Holy crap no you are not overreacting. I don't even leave candles burning if I go out for 20 minutes, let alone leaving two small children. It's concerning that he thinks that's a reasonable level of risk taking with kids that young. NTA.", "NTA. \n\n\u2026why couldn\u2019t he just take the kids with him? Unless \u201cout of gas\u201d literally means he had to get a gas can and had to walk to the station to get it, there\u2019s no logical reason to not take them.", "NTA. When I was 4 years old I woke up one morning and couldn't find my mom. I had a full-on mental breakdown, thinking I had been abandoned and would be alone from now on. My mom found me an hour later, sobbing under my bed. She had been waiting in the garden for me to wake up so we could eat breakfast. I still remember that morning very vividly today. Don't leave little kids alone at home.", "NTA. About 20 years ago I read in my local paper about a horrific death a toddler in my city suffered when he was left alone. I have seen dozens of horror movies, but this story traumatized me so much that to this day, I can't even repeat it to anyone.", "NTA. It only takes 20 for an electrical outlet to short and cause a fire.", "A lot can happen in 20 minutes. A parent is responsible for the safety and well-being of their children and it is neglect to leave them unattended... especially for such a trivial reason. What if there is a fire? Who will get the children out of the house? What if the trip turns into hours due to an accident or other emergency factors? How long will it be before someone gets to the children? Depending on where you live leaving them alone at this age could also be illegal...it is in my US state, Oregon.\n\nHere's the thing....the risk is simply not worth it. Your husband can wake the kids up early and all of them can go get gas...it's probably inconvenient but it's the responsible thing to do. Having kids means taking the extra precautions so you can say you did everything in your power to keep them safe\u2014being a parent is full of inconveniences! \n\nThink of the story your husband would have to live with if a rare but still possible crazy situation happened...'I left my two toddlers alone in the house in the middle of the night so it would be more convenient for me to get gas, I thought it would be fine, a quick trip...but while I was gone no one was there to help them when [a fire broke out, the child had a medical emergency, etc.].' \nThat's not an acceptable situation to create...in those moments he's their only protector and he can't protect them if he's at the frickin gas station. \n\nNot worth it. Not the asshole.", "NTA. This was dangerous, selfish, and stupid. How hard is it to put two kids in the car, get gas, and bring them back home? This makes no sense. Your husband is an unreliable partner.", "NTA. What he did was unsafe (and illegal).", "What if something happens to him when he\u2019s out - a car accident, for example?  NTA.", "NTA you never leave kids that young at home alone period", "NTA\n\nWhat your husband did wasn\u2019t just AHy, but illegal.\n\nSo so so so so NTA.", "NTA. I'm a single mom with no family in the area and I have managed to never leave a toddler home alone. This is a totally unsafe thing and not okay at all and I would be beside myself with fury of someone did this with my child or children. Anything could have happened, and if it did you guys could have lost custody to CPS.\n\nWhat if he was in a car accident? 20 minutes is not necessarily 20 minutes.", "NTA \n\n1. You need to impress upon him that if something happens to him (accident, flat tire, anything out of his control) then the kids are alone and he is (possibly) at the hospital or working on the tire at the side of the road for a couple of hours. \n\n2. Further, the risk is also fire. If there is a fire next door or suddenly in your own home , no one is there to help the children. \n\n3. The kids could wake up/ Be scared and leave the house as you indicated. Someone could call the police and then\u2026 he is arrested.\n\n\nNTA all day! So scary!", "My friend's parent did this when she was little. She woke up, couldn't find mom and ran into the porch. Mom wasn't there so she she started crying. Neighbor heard and grabbed her and brought her in her house until mom got home. Luckily somebody else didn't grab her and she didn't run into the street. Last time mom went out for cigarettes though. NTA.", "NTA, he is putting your children at risk. Your home could have been burglarized, children kidnapped or murdered. Your house could have burned down with children inside. The children could have had a health emergency and it is completely irresponsible behavior.", "NTA. What was the problem the babysitter couldn\u2019t have gotten gas? There was enough gas to get to the gas station so she wouldn\u2019t have a problem getting the gas.", "NTA.  First of all don't give him ANY excuses like it is hard for just 1 parent.  A ton of us single parents manage to get gas everyday.  You put your kids in the car and get it before they go to sleep.  When it is hard is when the parent is sick at midnight and needs medicine.  Do you wake up the kids and drag them to the drug store or suffer until morning.  Either of those is an acceptable solution.\n\n2nd anything can happen.  Your kid could have woken up, looked for dad, started walking around outside and gotten turned around.  A house fire can start and engulf the house in the time it takes to fill a car with gas.\n\nYou are correct, we don't leave young children home alone EVER!!!   The fact that your husband is so casual about it is terrifying.", "NTA.\n\nThis is divorce-worthy. It's an outstanding lack of judgement on your husband's part. He could have buckled your kids up at midnight and taken them with him if it was that dire. What if he had run out of gas on the way there? Then 20 minutes would be more like 2-3 hours", "Holy crap. NTA at all. They are too young to be left alone.", "NTA.  How is this even a question?  You would be guilty of a dereliction of duty as a parent if you didn't demand this!", "NTA. You need a new partner.", "NTA \n\nYour husband needs to learn how to be a responsible adult. Then he\u2019s gaslighting you on top of it and saying you\u2019re overreacting. Your judgement is correct and your worry warranted. Don\u2019t let it go, these are your babies.", "NTA. That was an unacceptable risk. Period.", "NTA - Never leave small children alone , its dangerous \nYour husband is crazy to do that", "NTA", "Mild YTA.  \n\nI get that your concern comes from a good place, but there are two people who are responsible for these kids, not just you.  You aren't the ONLY and FINAL source of judgment for what is and isn't okay.  His opinion matters too.  \n\n> He said he might do it but he heard and understood my concern.  \n> I am livid. One I asked him not to do it  \n\nSo he said he heard and understood your concern, and now you are livid because he didn't do exactly as you say.  If being 'livid' is in any way justified, then you weren't asking, you were ordering/demanding.  \n\nAnd you are also not considering that you're asking him to do something unpleasant (wake up much earlier).  That isn't irrelevant here.  \n\nI think when you get back you and he should have a *respectful* discussion about whether or not it's okay to leave the kids alone, and if so for how long.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let's just say that I'm currently in therapy for things that wouldn't have happened if they had been more responsible.", "What if a fire breaks out? A buglary. NTA.", "NTA, Last year in England there was a case where four young children were left alone in their home, a fire broke out and the children were all killed in the fire. Children should not be left alone until they are old enough to understand what to do in an emergency and even then they shouldn't be left alone without knowing that they are going to be alone. What if they had woken up, panicked and gone to try and find him?", "Yta.  \nEasy,  just agree no more work travel.", "NTA. Omg my stepson (5M) would freak out if he woke up and we weren\u2019t home. And for your kids it might be even worse since you\u2019re away on a trip. And god forbid anything happens like a freak fire or they get up to look for a parent and fall down the stairs or something idk. Maybe I\u2019m paranoid but I\u2019d be pissed if my stepson was left home alone and he\u2019s not even my child.", "Yup. A simple question one can ask is \"Would CPS frown upon this?\" and if the answer is yes, you are not an asshole for expecting others not to do said thing with your child.", "Both our parents were at home and fighting fiercely when I, at 5, loaded my brothers (3 and 1 month) into the pram with blankets and a bottle and headed out into the winter-dark streets, hoping to find the bus that would take us to my grandparents' house. A policeman found us blocks away on a main street. My parents hadn't noticed that we were gone. And this is how we ended up being wards of the court.\n\nNever underestimate children.\n\nOP, you are NTA, but how will you prevent such risky choices in the future?", ">The risk isn't \"what if something happens during the 20 minutes\".  Your husband is right.  They won't wake up and even if they did, they're not going to be out wandering the streets when he gets back.  \n>  \n>The risk is \"what if it's not 20 minutes\".  What if he got in a car accident or got a flat tire or any of a hundred things that wouldn't be his fault but could stretch that 20 minutes into several hours\n\nIt's both.\n\nSure, in this case nothing happened. But a lot can happen during those 20 minutes, while nothing happened the first time, doesn't mean that nothing can happen the next time.\n\nBut you are also correct. 20 minutes can become a lot more: accident on route, car trouble, him having a heart attack, him being robbed at the gasstation, whatever else... \n\nHubby is definitely the AH! And if he were my husband, I would seriously reconsider the relationship: I'm not one demanding divorce from the get go, but leaving my very young children alone at home (even if he just went to the neighbour for 5-10 minutes to ask for some sugar or the likes) would make me furious!", "Really? See my response. I literally found my neighbour's 2-year-old wandering the streets barefoot in a diaper under similar circumstances. It happens ALL THE TIME. Kids are found wandering blocks from their house ALL THE TIME while the parents are asleep or left them alone 'just for a short time'. You couldn't be more wrong.", "In that situation the kids go in a buggy. Works better as the petrol can can be put underneath and not need carrying", "If the police or child protective services knew the children were left alone at that age, they would be in very serious trouble and potentially have their kids removed. This isn\u2019t something she should even have to tell him. Your response is wild", "When leaving 2 small children home alone the correct response is to be livid. She is clearly the only full grown adult in this relationship.\n\nThere is no respectful conversation when it comes to your children's safety.  \n\nSo if he chose to beat them with the belt, buckle hitting them, she should calmly talk about it because they both have a say in how the children are raised?", "Yikes, this is quite the hot take.", "She's livid because he put the children in danger. So that he didn't have to wake up early. You're absolutely ridiculous.", "Many places have a minimum age before children are able to be left alone as they are not mature enough to handle situations should they arise.", "If it's unsafe or illegal, you don't do it, period. \n\nIt doesn't matter if one parent thinks a five minute car ride without a carseat is fine, it's not. It's both unsafe and illegal.\n\nIt doesn't matter if one parent is okay leaving 2 small kids at home alone for 20 minutes, because it's unsafe and illegal. \n\nThere are all kinds of things that you can apply this logic too. \n\nYes, it is 100% okay for a parent to order or demand the other follows laws and safety rules for their kids. JFC. In what damned world is it cool to risk your child's safety and wellbeing, or your continuing custody of them, just to say you had a 'respectful discussion'. There's nothing to discuss. You just *don't do it.* why? BECAUSE ITS UNSAFE AND ILLEGAL.", "Sounds like that was a positive outcome for your situation?", "When my niece was three, and we were all asleep, this little girl put on her favorite princess dress, and decided she was going on an adventure.\n\nThe police found her at a local playground about five blocks away, sitting on the slide--at three in the morning. \n\n**Never underestimate unsupervised toddlers.**", "They were probably asleep for more than 20 minutes.  \n\nParents sometimes need to shower or take a shit or mow the lawn or do other things that take more than 20 minutes.  The 20 minutes is really not the problem.", "This is absolutely false. Leaving child to sleep for 20 minutes may not be your or my definition of good parenting, but CPS wouldn't give a flying shit. CPS deals with sexual and physical abuse and abandonment, and they have their hands plenty full.", "Good question. I think it galvanized a helping community of social workers and counselors, most of whom acted to our benefit, which in turn acted to support my mother, brothers and me, so we could stay together. Mistakes were made, of course, but overall we encountered kindness and goodwill.\n\nIn the 80s my husband and I took in emergency placements, sometimes in the middle of the night, to try in some way to pay forward that network of helpers. Even then, social workers were grossly overworked and underpaid, and the public resource behind them had frayed.", "You are wrong. Google \u201cinadequate supervision for children\u201d and you will see there are many parents charged. Not to mention it\u2019s specifically illegal in 4 states. It\u2019s terrifying that you think this is fine", "It is very dependent on where you live and how much CPS wants to fuck with you. In my state, children under 12 cannot be left home alone. A single mom left her 8 year old home alone and a fire started next door and spread into their apartment. The kid got out on their own and was fine, but CPS still charged the mom with child neglect and took her kid from her.", "Read better while clutching your pearls. I didn't say it was fine. I said it wasn't good parenting, I just noted that CPS has other things to do."]}
