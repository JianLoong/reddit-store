You're never getting it back. Take it as a lesson to not lend money to family.\n\nAlso, if you're petty like me, when her child is born, just give a card and say your gift is the $300: if she bought a pram, that's your present.\n\nGive in to the pettiness! Let it wash over you!", "NTA don't loan her money again, or babysit when she asks because she won't pay you either. Will use the \"we're family\" card.", "NTA obviously. Tough shit if she\u2019s preggers and can\u2019t afford it - you\u2019re not a bank. And if you were you\u2019d expect that $300 back plus interest", "NTA.  Sounds like your sister never intended to pay you back.  I doubt you will get the money but don't be surprised when she asks for more, you know... for the baby.", "NTA. I don't think you will ever see it back. Make her a paper with the debt and interest. As baby shower gift, reduce it a bit and tell her this is her gift. Christmas and bday gifts same. Tell her this are the only present her and her kid will get until the debt is cleared. And of course no babysitting possible until it is done, unless she pays upfront.", "NTA: your sister doesn\u2019t respect the principle but instead of bothering her about it leave her alone. She\u2019s right, babies are expensive and I guarantee you when your niece or nephew get here she\u2019s going to require more financial aid from you. At that point you\u2019ll have to set a boundary and say no because you can\u2019t afford it due to you saving for college. She will probably act like a brat and she might get other family members involved to try and guilt trip you, but you stand your ground and if any extended family try to pressure you into giving her money, you kindly suggest they give her the money instead and see how quickly they fall back. \n\nThe way I see it, it\u2019s not about the money, but the principle. She never had any intention of paying you back evidently, so now she\u2019ll have to suffer long term consequences for it. And in the event she does pay you back, I wouldn\u2019t recommend you borrow her money in the future because it\u2019s actually seems to be more hassle than it\u2019s worth.", "NTA.  But OP, unless you have an *I Owe You* in writing, there is no \u201cthat\u2019s final\u201d as there is literally nothing you can do to enforce repayment.  This is exactly why many people do not loan money to relatives or friends.  You are not the first nor last to learn this lesson the hard way.\n\nOP, you are never going to see that money again so you have 2 choices: 1) cut ties with her over $300 and miss out on your nibling\u2019 s life or 2) let it go and be the fun uncle your nibling deserves.\n\nPerhaps you could forgive the loan as your baby shower and new baby gifts to her?  Forgiving the loan as her gift would allow you the opportunity to mentally let it go; a form of closure, if you will.  That way you have a clean slate with your sister and can enjoy your new nibling with no hard feelings clouding cuddle time.  Just don\u2019t loan her money again.", "NTA, but she is a thief. She never planned to repay you. She will try again. Do as others suggested. At the baby shower and every holiday, give her a card:  \"Your gift is $X deducted from the money you owe me.\" Make sure it's in public and the amount is moderate. She will need this repeated to learn her lesson. And ffs do NOT give her actual gifts!", "NTA.  You will never get the money.  Consider it a $300 life lesson learned.  That is the best you can do.  Explain to her that no matter what disasters she encounters in the future, your name is off the list of people she can use as a bank.", "NTA. Kiss that money goodbye.", "NTA. Take this as a life lesson to never loan anyone money unless you\u2019re willing to gift it to them. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get your money back. You could say to her that she can keep the $300 in lieu of giving her a baby gift.", "NTA\n You aren\u2019t getting the money back but you also don\u2019t have to get her a shower gift. Don\u2019t lend money you can\u2019t afford to lose.", "Tell you sister if you don't get your money you will charge for baby sitting", "NTA. You\u2019re going to have to write it off 18 months later she\u2019s not paying it back, and lesson learned don\u2019t lend money. Hope she never expects you to babysit, refuse.", "NTA.  I wonder if your sister realizes that the bank at your house is now permanently closed?", "**NTA** \n\nIf you skip a few occasions when you otherwise would have given gifts to her, that should be enough to correct her debt.", "NTA for wanting to get repaid. Naive to think you would get repaid.\n\nRule of thumb: Never loan money you can't live without.\n\nConsider it a baby gift and make sure you never loan her money again.", "NTA but just move on, I think. \n\nYou're not getting it back. Hopefully some day she's in a better financial position but she probably doesn't have a spare $300 right now so I would just tell her that you'll let the $300 go and that's her baby shower gift and just let it go. \n\nI don't know how your family is, but over the years in a close family, things just sort of even out or maybe it's very one sided but it doesn't really matter in grand scheme. But that's just my opinion.", "NTA - but she was never going to pay you back.  When you loan friends or family money, it's always best to assume you may not get it back.\n\nYou have a right to be upset, but IMO you should let it go.  $300 isn't worth creating a rift between you and your sister.  Consider it a moderately expensive lesson learned about lending money to family (and your sister in particular).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It ruins relationships. It\u2019s better to gift it than loan it. And if you aren\u2019t willing to gift it not to get involved is best.", "NTA. But this is why you should never lend money without a written agreement to pay it back. Judge Judy would scold you hard.", "NTA. She made a promise and reneged. So far all the blame is on her.\n\nIs your relationship worth $300 though? Because you are not getting that cash back with a baby on the way. A bitter pill to swallow, but realistically it is gone.\n\nMaybe warn her in advance not to expect baby gifts from you, and that if she doesn't make a fuss, you won't tell your side. (I don't recommend grandstanding at a family event to embarrass her. 100% guaranteed backfire if you do)", "NTA, but you are not getting that money back, on the other hand though she just let you know what the perfect gift for her baby shower will be, just give her a note saying Debt forgiven, or even better one that says I.O.U 300 dollars and then say \"damn I guess we are even now huh\"", "NTA - doesn\u2019t matter if it was $300 or $3 it\u2019s yours and you want it back", "NTA, but I think you're going to have to write off the money.\n\nJust don't lend her any more.", "NTA. Sounds like she's trying reeaaaallly hard to not have to pay that back. \n\nIn all honesty now due to the baby, I feel like other people like family and friends will start taking her side. Goodluck, and I hope you get what's yours", "NTA\n\nHer situation doesn\u2019t preclude the fact that she still owes you money.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t repay it, do not babysit for free and don\u2019t contribute high dollar gifts for the baby. Take the difference saved away from what she owes you. It may be the only way to get it back.", "NTA. She can not write off the debt because she can not afford to pay it. That is absurd. Also, she would have paid it off if she wanted to.\n\nBut, on a second note, she was your sister, she was down on her luck. I think you should have given her the money outright or not let her borrow at all. Even at this point, the smarter way to go would be to not ask for repayment.

But\u2026I think the lesson for the sister can be driven home a bit harder. Baby shower: card saying congratulations! $100 of your debt to me is forgiven. On next major life event that requires a gift to be given (Not Christmas or her birthday. But something people really remember. I.e. getting married, buying first home, baby\u2019s first birthday.) you do the same thing.

The two are NOT related.\n\nShe needs to figure it out.", "NTA. at this point I'd just say cut your losses and make it a point to tell her that you will never be loaning her money again. She's definitly not going to pay you back. You could try to sue in small claims I guess but that's entirely up to you.", "You're never going to get that money back so tell her there'll be no baby presents coming from you because you've already given.
