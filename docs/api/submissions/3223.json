{"id": 3223, "submission_id": "z4jzh0", "title": "AITA for not wanting my fianc\u00e9 to change her hair before our wedding?", "selftext": "My (28f) fianc\u00e9 (29f) and I dated for 3 years before she asked me to marry her. Let's call her Angie.\n\nSome background info: Angie LOVES to do her hair. She loves dying it bright colors and doing it up and randomly cutting it. She takes pride in her hairstyles. Currently, her hair is shaved a little on the sides, her blonde roots are growing in, and her multicolored hair has faded a little (But it still looks awesome). For our wedding, she is planning on doing her hair up in a fancy bun, and keep her slightly faded rainbow tips and shaved sides. Some say that her hair looks weird, but I think she looks beautiful no matter what. Plus, she loves it, therefore I love it. \n\nRecently, I was talking to my parents about the wedding, and they asked me what Angie was planning to do with her hair. I told them about her plans, and my parents were shocked. They said that they had thought that she was going to dye her hair back to her natural blonde for the wedding. (Nobody ever told them that she would be doing that) I corrected them, saying \"No, she is keeping it how it is.\" \n\nMy parents started freaking out, saying that the wedding photos would look hideous and that she NEEDS to dye it. I told them no. They freaked out. They yelled at me for a while and brought me to tears. (It's embarrassing but I'm really emotional and I can't stand when people yell at me) I excused myself and went home. Angie asked me what happened and I angrily told her what my parents said. Angie seemed disappointed and said that it isn't a big deal, and she can just dye her hair for the wedding. I told her no. I know how exited she has been for this. She told me that it's not a big deal, and she doesn't want to start drama with my parents. I told her not to, because she really wanted her hair like that for the wedding. I eventually convinced Angie that it wasn't a big deal, and that her hair is beautiful, so she should wear it how she wants. \n\nLater I got a text from my Aunt saying that I am an AH, that my parents are helping pay for the wedding photos and that I'm repaying their kindness back with disobedience and rebellion. \n\nI really don't feel bad about it, because my fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for almost the whole wedding anyway, and we are paying $2,500 in total for the wedding photographer, we just asked for a few hundred from my parents (who are well off due to my father having a really good job, and if they said no it would have been fine) but we didn't ask for any other financial help from them for the wedding. \n\nI didn't text my Aunt back, and I honestly don't really feel bad about it because I prioritize Angie's happiness at our wedding more than my parent's happiness.

Contributing funds doesn't give your parents the right to make over your fiancee to their liking.  Her hair should be whatever she wants it to be.

I'd ask your mom how she would feel if your fiance demanded she change her hair style or color for your wedding.\n\n\nYour wedding pictures are yours, not theirs.  Your wedding is about you guys, not your parents.\n\n\nMy guess is that they have never liked her hair styles and colors, and want to show off her \"traditional\" look for their family and friends, whether at the wedding or in photos.\n\n\nHonestly I would send them back the couple hundred theu gave you.", "NTA but you need to have a chat with your parents once everyone had calmed down because talking about obedience at this age is embarrassing. If it\u2019s about the money, better to not take it than to deal with this sort of drama. Why do they care if her hair is rainbow or blonde or shaved?

Support in the form of money does not give you agency over another persons body. Your fianc\u00e9e gets to do whatever she wants with her hair, just like the rest of her body, on HER wedding day, just like you do.

There is no reason for her to dye it a \"natural\" color to appease your parents' sense of photographic aesthetic.", "NTA, for one your aunt shouldn't be commenting on this situation because she isn't involved. What it says is that your family has a hierarchy that points to you not deserving respect. You are also an adult and you are a person getting married, no one should be speaking to you like this.\n\nIf your parents made their funding of your wedding conditional on having control over you and your fiance they shouldn't have given you the money. Your fiance is allowed to look like how she usually looks on her wedding day, she doesn't have to change up her entire look, why would she want wedding pictures where she doesn't look like herself but instead looks like the image your parents want?\n\nIt's definitely not something to fold on, telling your parents that they are allowed to control your fiance's body would be a bad precedent. Ignore your aunt and maybe block her since she is trying to involve herself in a situation that does not concern her", "NTA - My SIL had pink hair at her wedding and family kept telling her to dye it brown because of pictures. In turn everyone in the wedding partt put pink in their hair as well as my parents. \n\nScrew em.", "NTA, and your parents and aunt can all blow horn.", "Nta. Really, I'm kind of offended by your parents. \n\nThese are your wedding photos. If they don't want to hang it up on their wall, they don't have to. But to expect to be able to dictate things like hair color is just an insane expectation from any parent of the brides.\n\nBesides, if your fiance changes her hair for them now, what would stop your parents from continuing to make more demands? For more changes?\n\nIt is not up to your fiance to change her self to make your parents more comfortable around her. It is up to your parents to either accept her or not. This halfway acceptance, with plans for remolding your fiance, should not be acceptable to your fiance! It obviously isn't acceptable to you. \n\nShe must really love you to be willing to change her hair to get on your parents good side. And you seem willing to make her rights a hill to die on. I think you two will be fine in the long run. Just sorry you have to go through this.\n\nEdit - forgot to say Congratulations!!!\n\nEdit two - forgot about the aunt because she us an irrelevant nobody butting in where she doesn't belong.

Your parents don't get to vote.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe wedding is about you and your fiancee, not your parents. \n\nHer hair sounds awesome and beautiful, and will look wonderful in your wedding photos. \n\nMy friend had her hair magenta halfway down and it looked stunning in the updo she had for her wedding", "NTA. \n\nBut you need to let Angie do what she wants.  If she feels like she'd rather dye it to have a drama free wedding and not have issues with your parents, let her.  If she wants to make it even more outlandish as an F-U to them, let her.
