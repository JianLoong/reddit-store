{"id": 3223, "submission_id": "z4jzh0", "title": "AITA for not wanting my fianc\u00e9 to change her hair before our wedding?", "selftext": "My (28f) fianc\u00e9 (29f) and I dated for 3 years before she asked me to marry her. Let's call her Angie.\n\nSome background info: Angie LOVES to do her hair. She loves dying it bright colors and doing it up and randomly cutting it. She takes pride in her hairstyles. Currently, her hair is shaved a little on the sides, her blonde roots are growing in, and her multicolored hair has faded a little (But it still looks awesome). For our wedding, she is planning on doing her hair up in a fancy bun, and keep her slightly faded rainbow tips and shaved sides. Some say that her hair looks weird, but I think she looks beautiful no matter what. Plus, she loves it, therefore I love it. \n\nRecently, I was talking to my parents about the wedding, and they asked me what Angie was planning to do with her hair. I told them about her plans, and my parents were shocked. They said that they had thought that she was going to dye her hair back to her natural blonde for the wedding. (Nobody ever told them that she would be doing that) I corrected them, saying \"No, she is keeping it how it is.\" \n\nMy parents started freaking out, saying that the wedding photos would look hideous and that she NEEDS to dye it. I told them no. They freaked out. They yelled at me for a while and brought me to tears. (It's embarrassing but I'm really emotional and I can't stand when people yell at me) I excused myself and went home. Angie asked me what happened and I angrily told her what my parents said. Angie seemed disappointed and said that it isn't a big deal, and she can just dye her hair for the wedding. I told her no. I know how exited she has been for this. She told me that it's not a big deal, and she doesn't want to start drama with my parents. I told her not to, because she really wanted her hair like that for the wedding. I eventually convinced Angie that it wasn't a big deal, and that her hair is beautiful, so she should wear it how she wants. \n\nLater I got a text from my Aunt saying that I am an AH, that my parents are helping pay for the wedding photos and that I'm repaying their kindness back with disobedience and rebellion. \n\nI really don't feel bad about it, because my fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for almost the whole wedding anyway, and we are paying $2,500 in total for the wedding photographer, we just asked for a few hundred from my parents (who are well off due to my father having a really good job, and if they said no it would have been fine) but we didn't ask for any other financial help from them for the wedding. \n\nI didn't text my Aunt back, and I honestly don't really feel bad about it because I prioritize Angie's happiness at our wedding more than my parent's happiness.

Does your aunt know that you're 28 and not 8? She really needs to calm down and stay out of your business. \n\nAnd your parents need to realize it's not their wedding even if they are contributing. You are NTA", "NTA. I\u2019d tell your family If they were so worried hair color would ruin a wedding they can go screw and you\u2019d see them someday", "NTA- it is her hair colour, a wedding should be about the love of the two people getting married and two families getting joined together..  as a person with colourful hair i would 100% get married with brighter hair than what she has with the faded out rainbow.. i most likely would have re-dyed it rainbow. the photos of brides with rainbow hair is so beautiful i really love a coloured hair look in a bridal dress. BUT the main point is this is her body and she needs to feel happy and confident on her wedding day. you are marrying her.. for who she is and this is an element of a thing she loves. good for you for standing up for her :)", "NTA.  Contributing funds doesn't give your parents the right to make over your fiancee to their liking.  Her hair should be whatever she wants it to be.  It blows my mind how many people get caught up in the aesthetics of the wedding to the point of alienating people who they are supposed to be there to support and encourage.  All the best, congrats on your wedding, and I'm sure your fiancee's hair will look great!", "\u201cDisobedient and Rebellious\u201d I think the fluff not!!! \ud83e\udd2c The audacity of anyone thinking they have the right to dictate how your fianc\u00e9 does her hair is ridiculous! YNTA\n\nCongratulations on your engagement, and I wish you and your wife a long and joyful marriage!", "NTA- your parents are being shallow and judgemental.", "NTA\n\n\nBravo for having your fiance's back and making sure she didn't change her hair for them.\n\n\nIf she changed her hair for them now, what else will they expect?  I'd ask your mom how she would feel if your fiance demanded she change her hair style or color for your wedding.\n\n\nYour wedding pictures are yours, not theirs.  Your wedding is about you guys, not your parents.\n\n\nMy guess is that they have never liked her hair styles and colors, and want to show off her \"traditional\" look for their family and friends, whether at the wedding or in photos.\n\n\nHonestly I would send them back the couple hundred theu gave you.", "NTA but you need to have a chat with your parents once everyone had calmed down because talking about obedience at this age is embarrassing. If it\u2019s about the money, better to not take it than to deal with this sort of drama. Why do they care if her hair is rainbow or blonde or shaved? Will they be embarrassed to frame the wedding photos? Because they don\u2019t need to have any photos at the end of the day, or to invite anyone who may be appalled by it.", "NTA, you're an adult getting married and your parents need to learn to respect your decisions. Your aunt is out of line by adding her two cents.", "NTA not one bit. Angie sounds lovely and you are clearly so much in love!\n\nIt was sweet that Angie was willing to change back to blonde, but you were right in telling her not to and to do what she wants. You said yourself you think she will look lovely. \n\nSorry but you parents and Aunt are being assholes. How dare they dictate their daughter in laws hair? It's not their wedding, and if they're paying towards some of it, doesn't mean they get to control what you do. A gift should be a gift and just that!", "Wtaf! NTA! Support in the form of money does not give you agency over another persons body. Your fianc\u00e9e gets to do whatever she wants with her hair, just like the rest of her body, on HER wedding day, just like you do. It's pretty gross of your family to push this on your partner.\n\nI can absolutely understand why this would be stressful for you, and I'm so sorry you're both dealing with such a lack of kindness surrounding an event that is entirely about your love \ud83d\ude1e\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - it\u2019s your wedding not theirs.   It is unspeakably rude to say that your wedding photos would look hideous.   \n\nYou will both look lovely and happy and joyful.  Congratulations on your big day!  I hope you have a long and happy life together.", "NTA and bravo for standing up for your fiance to your parents. That your parents think her hair color for some pictures is somehow more important than you loving and supporting your fiance in her decisions is shallow as hell. You have a wonderful base for a healthy loving marriage and I wish you all the best.", "NTA, it's your wedding, you get to decide what you'll look like on that special day. Your family should have no say in this, sure they can suggest something, but the final decision is up to you. Have a great wedding :)", "This is infuriating, I don't understand how they could possibly think that's a reasonable request. I really hope she doesn't change to appease small mindedness.\n\nYou sound like a lovely couple, I hope you both have a wonderful day \ud83d\udda4 nta.", "NTA. Return the money to them and make it very clear that if this continues to be a thing and/or they send any more flying monkeys to complain about your \"disobedient and rebellious behavior\" aka you supporting Angie in her hair decision, EVERYONE'S(them, aunt whomever ever else decides they need to weigh in on your parent's side) wedding invites will be rescinded. \n\nIf you want to be \"petty\" encourage Angie to get her tips touched up as your wedding gift to her.", "Nta I had rainbow hair for my wedding. my husband and I absolutely love the pictures. Your parents suck. Not their bodies not their choice. Tell your soon to be wife that as along as she loves her hair anyone who thinks they get a say to shove it.", "NTA your parents are, if they are that uppity maybe it would be better for you and your fianc\u00e9 to go low contact. If they can\u2019t truly accept her for her and that having colourful shaved hair is that big of an issue for them they don\u2019t truly care for your fianc\u00e9 if they are gonna keep fighting you on this tell them they don\u2019t have to be in the pictures or at the wedding", "NTA. How dare your parents even request that! It is a day about you and Angie, not your parents.\nGood on you for standing up for her. You guys are clearly in love and I wish you a long and happy marriage \ud83d\udc95", "NTA send the money back to your parents so they cannot tell people they are paying for the wedding and using it to control you. If it is only a few hundred you can trim it from somewhere hopefully. Disobedience and rebellion isn't a thing once you are an adult.", "You\u2019re going to be a stellar wife and your fianc\u00e9 is awesome for volunteering to change her hair. NTA.  Tell your parents to go suck an egg\n\nEdit: to correct gender", "NTA your parents are though.", "NTA\n\nYou're grown adults, you and your fianc\u00e9e can dress and wear your hairs exactly how you want during your wedding. \n\nI think in your shoes I'd tell your parents that their contribution to the picture costs is not needed any longer, you have it covered. They're trying to use money as way to control you and your fianc\u00e9e, so cut that line off immediately.", "NTA it is your wedding and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s, how she wears her hair is up to her. If she changes it, you\u2019ll look back at the photos and wonder who that lady is. Your family gets no say in this no matter if they are contributing or not", "NTAH this is you and your wife's wedding not theirs do what makes you happy. Like you said she is always beautiful to you, you will be a good wife. Congratulations.", "NTA. Angie has dyed hair. That's part of her personality. There is no reason for her to dye it a \"natural\" color to appease your parents' sense of photographic aesthetic.", "NTA, for one your aunt shouldn't be commenting on this situation because she isn't involved. What it says is that your family has a hierarchy that points to you not deserving respect. You are also an adult and you are a person getting married, no one should be speaking to you like this.\n\nIf your parents made their funding of your wedding conditional on having control over you and your fiance they shouldn't have given you the money. Your fiance is allowed to look like how she usually looks on her wedding day, she doesn't have to change up her entire look, why would she want wedding pictures where she doesn't look like herself but instead looks like the image your parents want?\n\nIt's definitely not something to fold on, telling your parents that they are allowed to control your fiance's body would be a bad precedent. Ignore your aunt and maybe block her since she is trying to involve herself in a situation that does not concern her", "NTA - My SIL had pink hair at her wedding and family kept telling her to dye it brown because of pictures. In turn everyone in the wedding partt put pink in their hair as well as my parents. \n\nScrew em.", "NTA, and your parents and aunt can all blow horn.", "Nta. Really, I'm kind of offended by your parents. \n\nThese are your wedding photos. If they don't want to hang it up on their wall, they don't have to. But to expect to be able to dictate things like hair color is just an insane expectation from any parent of the brides.\n\nBesides, if your fiance changes her hair for them now, what would stop your parents from continuing to make more demands? For more changes?\n\nIt is not up to your fiance to change her self to make your parents more comfortable around her. It is up to your parents to either accept her or not. This halfway acceptance, with plans for remolding your fiance, should not be acceptable to your fiance! It obviously isn't acceptable to you. \n\nShe must really love you to be willing to change her hair to get on your parents good side. And you seem willing to make her rights a hill to die on. I think you two will be fine in the long run. Just sorry you have to go through this.\n\nEdit - forgot to say Congratulations!!!\n\nEdit two - forgot about the aunt because she us an irrelevant nobody butting in where she doesn't belong. She needs to shut up and butt out! I would tell her exactly that,  just in slightly nicer terms.", "Disobedience and rebellion? It's hair. Your parents don't get to vote.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe wedding is about you and your fiancee, not your parents. \n\nHer hair sounds awesome and beautiful, and will look wonderful in your wedding photos. \n\nMy friend had her hair magenta halfway down and it looked stunning in the updo she had for her wedding", "NTA. \n\nBut you need to let Angie do what she wants.  If she feels like she'd rather dye it to have a drama free wedding and not have issues with your parents, let her.  If she wants to make it even more outlandish as an F-U to them, let her.

Plus, she loves it, therefore I love it. \n\nYou and fiance are gonna have a long & happy life together. You see her beauty from her freedom & you stand up for her without question.

Your wife-to-be is the person she is and changing things to keep parents happy could be the start of a slippy slope.  What other changes would they want?\n\nThe one niggle is the money. If it isn't that much to you,consider returning it as it seems to come with a lot of ties. It will probably hurt your parents but does allow clear boundaries to be drawn. And being honest, you are almost 30 - you won't always be in agreement with your parents and that isn't disobedience because as an adult, you owe them respect instead of obedience.
