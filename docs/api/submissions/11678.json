It's been a pretty big adjustment for everyone, but for some weird reason she's butting heads with my kids particularly. She is their aunt and I agree they should respect her, but I don't like the way she acts like she's an authority figure to them. My youngest is three, so if she sees him doing something he isn't supposed to be doing, it's fine, helpful even, for her to correct him in the moment, but I don't want her making her own rules. As for our teenager, I'd prefer if she just came and talked to us.\n\nMy husband and I have two cars. We allow our son to drive any car in the driveway unless we tell him we need the car at a certain time. My sister kept telling him he needs to ask before taking the car, and they even argued about it a few times. My husband and I told her to stop, but she was worried she might need the car and it wouldn't be there. We told her to stop or we wouldn't let her borrow our cars at all.\n\nShe also keeps telling our toddler to pick up his toys while he is still playing with them. We don't make him pick up his toys until he is done playing unless it is bedtime or we need to go somewhere. He gets frustrated when she tells him to do things he knows he doesn't have to and he yells at her and she tells him not to yell at adults. Again, we told her to stop and leave the room if she is unhappy about a situation.\n\nLast night my son was in the kitchen making himself something to eat after practice and she told him to eat a vegetable. He didn't respond, and she went to the fridge and grabbed a bag of carrots. She tried to dump them in the pot, but he pulled the pot off the stove, and the carrots went everywhere. She was upset at the mess and food waste. He asked her if she was going to clean up the carrots because they were in his way.\n\nShe told him off for being disrespectful and said he needed to clean it because it was his fault. He said she was being a crazy bitch, and then they started yelling at each other. I ran in and they shouted over each other to tell me what happened. I asked my sister to leave so I could clean up and my son could finish cooking. She was mad I didn't make him clean it and said I was a bad mom.\n\nI told her that isn't for her to say and if she wanted to parent kids she should have had some, because mine don't need another mother. She walked away, and my son said he would clean the kitchen, so I went to go talk to her. She was crying and asked why we all hate her so much. I know my sister and her ex husband did plan on having kids before things broke down in their relationship. I feel bad for throwing that in her face. It wasn't my intention, but I got so frustrated.\n\nAm I a horrible sister?", "created_utc": 1678152422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kkwaw/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_should_have_kids/", "score": 1209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy when a child gets the impression that everything they do is wrong.\n\nI\u2019d give her a final warning and then have her leave if she can\u2019t be a decent guest. Your top obligation is to your minor children, not your adult sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>There are two very different types of respect; respect for a person as a human being, and respect for a person as an authority. But because we use the same word for these two different things, people often talk as if they were the same thing. So for example, when someone in authority says \u201cIf you don\u2019t respect me, I won\u2019t respect you.\u201d What they\u2019re actually saying (and justifying) is \u201cIf you don\u2019t respect me as an authority, I won\u2019t respect you as a human being.\u201d\n\nYour sister wants your children to respect her as an authority figure. At the same time she is failing to respect your children as human beings and is failing to respect you and your husband as the ultimate authority figures in your household.\n\nIt's time to give her a clear boundary and consequence: if she tries again to impose a rule on your children that is not your rule, she'll have to move out.  Your children's emotional safety and your family's peace and harmony is important.", "NTA, it honestly feels like your sister is reacting to the lack of control she has in her life right now by finding control in your house. You need to sit down with her and explain if she is going to stay with you the arguing and parenting stops now. Show her the comments on this post, maybe something will click with her", "NTA. I see why she\u2019s getting divorced if that\u2019s how she acts with kids that aren\u2019t hers in a home that\u2019s not hers. She needs to work on herself and it\u2019s ok if you\u2019re the catalyst for that realization even if it\u2019s painful.", "NTA but I am guessing she is showing signs of what caused the divorce. Maybe when things have calmed down a bit ask her why she feels the need to control/correct others. I suspect she is doing it because she doesn't feel in control of her own life. But that isn't something she should be putting on your kids. Sounds like she needs therapy to work through things.", "NTA.\n\nI would invite her to get a look at my brand-new doormat.  From the outside.\n\nBut that's just me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.", "NTA, there is nothing worse for a kid than people who are not parents trying to tell them what to do!! I lived with my mom, grandma and aunt... 3 moms is more than any kid needs... My relationship improved a lot with my aunt when she finally moved out!!", "NTA, but she's grapping for the tiniest amount of control she can have.    \nHave her join a pottery class, or something, but tell her that if she's ever trying to control your kids again, she will get a motel room, without fail.", "This. NTA, but your sister is probably responding the lack of control she feels in her life by trying to exert control over your kids.  When she is calm, have a 1:1 with her and discuss her feelings AND how she doesn't have a place in the chain of command. She is a guest, and is expected to act like one, or she is welcome to leave.", "I agree.  If this behavior is new for her, it's coming from somewhere, likely the divorce and all the change and lack of control.\n\nYour suggestions are good ones.", "What exactly is reasonable about these rules?", "This is so true. My MIL moved in with us when my kids were 11 and 8.  Prior to that they had spent time with her when she babysat or vacations. When she moved in she started trying to implement her \"rules\". They usually were about what the oldest could or couldn't do and conflicted with how we were teaching them. Eventually our daughter and her got into a shouting match (this was wrong, she did get in trouble for yelling), and her grandmother said some things about to her about her behavior that went to far. We had to ask her to move out because she thought she was entitled to boss around our kids behavior even if it wasn't our rules or conflicted with our rules. Our daughter to this day almost a decade later holds a grudge. They both love her, but lost all respect.", "Unwarranted speculation. It's super common for people who feel like they've lost control in their life to start finding other things to control until they feel more safe. It's why people end up with everything from eating disorders to shit like the sister is doing here. \n\nHer marriage could be falling apart because she's controlling, or she's having a totally normal breakdown in the midst of her marriage falling apart and unrightfully making it everyone else's problem.", "Yus! She has a great son!", "Maybe baby carrots? But yeah whole carrots need, at the very least, washed before you cook with them. I also peel mine but that's a personal preference.", "This is especially bad since she'd literally just arrived ... why couldn't she have picked the sandwiches up on her way?", "I feel you. I was 25 when my aunt did that crap to me.", "She needs to leave for sure.", "Yep. That was my point as well.", "Don't bother dude....this is probably the aunt... Nothing else can explain the determination"]}
