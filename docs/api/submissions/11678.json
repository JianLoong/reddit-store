{"id": 11678, "submission_id": "11kkwaw", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she should have kids if she wants to parent them?", "selftext": "My sister is staying with us while her divorce processes. It's been a pretty big adjustment for everyone, but for some weird reason she's butting heads with my kids particularly. She is their aunt and I agree they should respect her, but I don't like the way she acts like she's an authority figure to them. My youngest is three, so if she sees him doing something he isn't supposed to be doing, it's fine, helpful even, for her to correct him in the moment, but I don't want her making her own rules. As for our teenager, I'd prefer if she just came and talked to us.\n\nMy husband and I have two cars. We allow our son to drive any car in the driveway unless we tell him we need the car at a certain time. My sister kept telling him he needs to ask before taking the car, and they even argued about it a few times. My husband and I told her to stop, but she was worried she might need the car and it wouldn't be there. We told her to stop or we wouldn't let her borrow our cars at all.\n\nShe also keeps telling our toddler to pick up his toys while he is still playing with them. We don't make him pick up his toys until he is done playing unless it is bedtime or we need to go somewhere. He gets frustrated when she tells him to do things he knows he doesn't have to and he yells at her and she tells him not to yell at adults. Again, we told her to stop and leave the room if she is unhappy about a situation.\n\nLast night my son was in the kitchen making himself something to eat after practice and she told him to eat a vegetable. He didn't respond, and she went to the fridge and grabbed a bag of carrots. She tried to dump them in the pot, but he pulled the pot off the stove, and the carrots went everywhere. She was upset at the mess and food waste. He asked her if she was going to clean up the carrots because they were in his way.\n\nShe told him off for being disrespectful and said he needed to clean it because it was his fault. He said she was being a crazy bitch, and then they started yelling at each other. I ran in and they shouted over each other to tell me what happened. I asked my sister to leave so I could clean up and my son could finish cooking. She was mad I didn't make him clean it and said I was a bad mom.\n\nI told her that isn't for her to say and if she wanted to parent kids she should have had some, because mine don't need another mother. She walked away, and my son said he would clean the kitchen, so I went to go talk to her. She was crying and asked why we all hate her so much. I know my sister and her ex husband did plan on having kids before things broke down in their relationship. I feel bad for throwing that in her face. It wasn't my intention, but I got so frustrated.\n\nAm I a horrible sister?", "created_utc": 1678152422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kkwaw/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_should_have_kids/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
