She can wait.   \n\n\nMe thinks Miss 11 had some kind of anxiety or control issues\u2026.", "Nta the kid is just testing the boundaries", "NTA Kevin is spoiling his child out of guilt", "I absolutely hate when I go to the bathroom and one of my kids immediately bugs me. I'm like go away and wait. I swear they wait till I have to go before deciding they need to go too", "NTA. Bathrooms are first come first serve. You don't triage as new people come in.", "NTA\n\nShe's 11. She should be totally toilet-trained.", "NTA I think where there's only one bathroom there are implied rules. In general first come, first served. He/she who has to leave the house earliest for work or school gets first chance at the shower, sink etc. Always with the proviso that any one with an emergency toilet issue gets to override the status quo.", "NTA.", "NTA   if you see someone in the bathroom doing non toilet things, the polite thing thing to do is say \"hey need to use the bathroom how long will you be\".  Now, I'm in my 50's so it's \"GTFO I need to pee\" bit that's a different story.", "NTA. When someone REALLY needs a toilet and you're not using it, you get the hell out immediately, but if she's not in distress, she can certainly wait her turn. Rachel's bored and trying out power moves to make sure she's daddy's #1.", "NTA - This wasn't a case of the mud butt", "NTA.  Everyone mentioned the kind of obvious manipulation about her deciding she needs the restroom after you start using it, but I will add that as a sibling with two sisters and a deceased third who was disabled (and of course mom and dad) bathroom etiquette is pretty simple.  If it's really urgent, you tell the person using the bathroom, otherwise you get to wait up to 15 m and that's pretty much all there is to it, no matter what they are doing in there. For a kid of a roommate, I'd try to keep it at 5, but sometimes you can't.", "NTA obviously. Out of curiosity, did you know that your roommate had a kid before moving in with him? I've lived in house shares too and that's one thing I could never put up with I don't think, as kids by nature have an awful understanding of boundaries \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. Rachel, however, is on her way to being a grade A selfish brat- thanks to her enabling father.", "NTA. I make my 6 year old wait longer than this because... if I'm using the bathroom and he is too stubborn to go up a flight of stairs to a different bathroom, that's his problem.", "Kevin is the reason why his daughter is the way she is. NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd don't ask her if it's an emergency. It's *always* an emergency with kids and the bathroom.\n\nIf she has that much trouble, I'd get her a camping toilet to keep in her father's bedroom.\n\nI'd also find another living situation. Spending every other weekend with an entitled 11 year old is not my idea of how I want to live.", "NTA.  I'd put money on it that she's doing it on purpose to p\\*\\*s you off.", "NTA She did this 4 times in one weekend? She is exerting dominance and making you move.", "I lived in a house with 9-10 people at times with one bathroom. Unless you are doing the pee-pee dance and announce it, you can wait while someone brushes their teeth or shaves. (Older summer cottage)\n\nIt is also standard that before bathing, you announce the fact and give anyone a chance to use the toilet before taking over the bathroom for 10-15 minutes.\\]", "INFO: is it worth it to live here? It seems a child is getting to make the rules. NTA", "Kevin and Rachel are both children.\n\nNTA.", "yep. if its something time consuming that i could do outside the bahtroom, like brushing/braiding my hair ill usually leave, but if its none of those then its my bathroom now. although it might be slightly different because we have more than one (although my siblings seem allergic to using all but one bathroom which is weird...)", "NTA. Close the door to the bathroom when you're in it so they're not making judgement calls about whether you brushing your teeth or pooping is more vital than whatever they want to do.\n\nIf they knock, you can agree to be out as soon as possible.", "If it\u2019s not needing to really pee / poop after a long trip or gut busting diarrhea, they can wait a few minutes. \n\nThis is how we always do it at home. NTA", "That\u2019s ridiculous. She\u2019s not three. I honestly would have pretended I didn\u2019t hear her until I was done brushing my teeth.", "Lock the fucking door, problem solved.", "The only time when it\u2019s \u201ceverybody out\u201d situation is when it\u2019s an uncontrollable situation\u2026 someone has the flu and is losing it at both ends. \n\nGo in, lock the door and do your business. 3 people to one bathroom is tough. Maybe it\u2019s worth having a \u201c15 minute limit\u201d agreed upon with everyone if this is a reoccurring issue.", "Did you close the door?", "Maybe she lacks ... interoception, I think it's called. But she said she didn't need to go badly, so you still get to finish your task", "NTA. She's jealous of you plain and simple. She thinks you are stealing her dad's time and therefore is acting out to prove she is the alpha female in his life.", "You could have called her bluff and offered her the use of the toilet while you were brushing. A child who truly has to go will would do so rather than soiling herself. If she declines, it\u2019s not that urgent. \n\nIf she had shown she was intending to use the toilet while you were there, you would have had the opportunity to step out and show her some privacy. \n\nNTA. This girl needs to learn that people around her will not assume a satellite position around her as the center of the universe.", "Nailed it.", "Yep my granddaughter used to do this...when she was 4", "That's definitely an important rule that I try to follow especially because I know that as soon as I hear water (like for a shower) I can't hold it for super long.", "Unfortunately we *just* re-signed the lease but next year I'm going to have my boyfriend move in instead.", "In fact, I\u2019m proud of you for standing your ground. Someone has to tell her no at some point.", "There was no suggestion that she was faking it. She needed to go but it was not urgent.", "That's terrible and I am so sorry you experienced that. Most of my lengthy endeavors I do in my own room anyway with the exception of showering, but I used to get held up by my dad's stomach problems when I was little and I know exactly what that feels like.", "Rachel is - I apologize if that was unclear.", "You're right, they can. But one would have to hold it for hours, not minutes.", "At what age does that stop being an emergency?", "We have very different definitions of emergency", "She does use it other times. This has been more of a recent thing this weekend that she has suddenly seemed to need it (not urgently) when I am in there. She doesn't seem to hear 'no' very much because when I tell her no about something (for example, picking up my cat) she often whines and says that she was 'just doing \\_\\_\\_\\_'; I get the feeling that her if her intentions were not malicious and she is upset then people just kind of give into it. But that's not something that I can observe on a daily basis so I might be wrong.", "She does have a lot of those. At the same time, I don't want to just assume that she is in the wrong every time that I disagree with her on something because that's not the right way to handle things or to treat people even though it's so easy to do.\n\nOh no that's pretty sucky and I really hope that it wasn't cold out.", "Unless it\u2019s an emergency, the girl can wait three minutes. End of story. It\u2019s nice of you to leave the bathroom to brush your hair, but you don\u2019t need to.", "Kids are master manipulators and will watch carefully for weak spots where they can apply leverage. Maybe because they are dependent, that makes them eager for power over the adults around them. I\u2019m speaking from painful experience as a stepmother. NTA. Stay calm and hold your ground.", "> if there's a rule that I'm unaware of and not respecting then I need to fix that on my end.\n\nAssholes rarely show this kind of active consideration.  \n\n\nNTA -- Don't let your Kevin of a Roommate start foisting parenting onto you btw. At least he seems to care about his kid, that part is nice.", "They are just making stuff up rather than teaching her socially appropriate manners. But going forward, just close and lock the door when you brush your teeth when she\u2019s around. If anyone knocks, hit the flush before you finish brushing and claim that you were using the restroom. They might suspect otherwise but they can\u2019t really prove anything so she will have to learn to wait", "Their side. Especially her side.", "Also the fact that it\u2019s your place that you pay rent for and she is just visiting", "NTA\nThat rule only applies if you were applying makeup or something long lasting that is not a need. Also there are emergency exceptions like if you are stomach sick. You don't want an accident and some brown panties.\n\nBut she can easily wait 8 min for you to finish brushing your teeth.", "I take long baths and I'll shout 'anyone need the bathroom before I get in the bath?' Which is a bit pointless as my husband and daughters will use the bathroom anyway. 'Mum I need to pee, can you pull the shower curtain?'      \nAnd if someone needs to poop I'll get out. I'll have had long enough as if they needed to poop when I got in they'd have said, and I'd have postponed my bath for half an hour to let the stink dissipate!\"", "It isn\u2019t their business what you\u2019re doing in there, I wouldn\u2019t pretend to do all this. And it\u2019s a waste of water lol. \u201cI\u2019m using the bathroom\u201d is sufficient", "That gets worse as you get older. Sorry to say. \n\nBut this child wants her daddy to herself imo.", "How do you assess urgency?\n\nEdited to add:  In my own habits, I tend to wait until the bathroom is unoccupied before using it.  If I ask to use it while someone is in there, it's because I really need to use it and am worried that I can't predict when the other person will be out.\n\nIf she were a guest in my home and asked to use it while I was brushing my teeth, I would assume that she needed me to vacate as soon as possible.", "It\u2019s been well over 20 years now so I don\u2019t have to see them again but man that got me. As long as you actually are doing something on a toilet in public I\u2019m cool with it. I now suffer from stomach problems and it can take a bit. Luckily I live alone so no one has to deal with it. XD", "Minutes here, minutes there, it all adds up. And, again, you can wait. Your teeth are not as important as someone else's bladder. If you want to be able to brush your teeth uninterrupted, then get an apartment by yourself or get an apartment with 2 bathrooms.", "No, 95 degrees florida. I knew they wouldn't be back for hours. I mowed the grass in my nightgown.  (My sister and her boy, it sucks when they act like this and parents just can't see it, but it happens. If I tried to do anything he would play \"mr. Innocent\" and parent thinks I'm mean.)", "great. (i mean it sounds like there\u2019s some stories there which are not so great, but at least there\u2019s a light at the end of this tunnel.) there\u2019s no rule, to my knowledge, that allows someone to kick you out of your bathroom because they need to go. if you were in the shower, or the bathtub, it makes sense to knock and ask when you really gotta go, imo, but you were doing something that takes two minutes, and she did not *need* to go. she\u2019s learning about manners, dad is sabotaging her (hopefully not on purpose), you\u2019re good. nta.", "Good. Though when \"next year\"?", "Yep. Does Kevin pay more for his precious spawn?\nEdit name", "He really does! She is his absolute world.", "She can have him, honestly. After a while I learned the hard way that he has enough excuses that his (very legitimate) problems turn into very real procrastination because things are just 'too hard'. As someone that has spent years fighting against depression, PTSD, anxiety and others, I know we have bad spells. But two years really isn't a bad spell, it's a way of life.", "Urgency would in this case be a situation where they have some kind of a medical need, they have been holding it for a long time, or they have to go really badly.", "Every minute that someone holds their urine on different events does not add up to a maximum amount of time in a safety zone. Waiting a few minutes does not put someone at risk either in the present or the future.", "That\u2019s definitely not how that works.", "Not at all how UTIs work.", "He does not - actually, he makes more money than I do and buys the food (and occasional household supplies like toilet paper) - but he pays less because he, in his own words, does not know how to manage his money and I am paying the majority. She also isn't around too often and her biggest cost if probably the food that she eats, but he does pay for that.", "Just a thought. Any possibility she could have a medical issue causing urgency, that her dad doesn\u2019t know about, either due to coparenting issues, or kid not telling dad due to daughter embarrassed to talk to dad about body issues, or maybe neither parent knows about? Very easy for dad to say there\u2019s no medical issue when he may have no idea. Has he asked her mom? Edited to add, nta, and dad probably not either, but hopefully dad checking into kiddo behavior. Spoiled kiddo behavior may need therapy to help both kid and dad. Does kiddo think you\u2019re dads girlfriend ?", "In my opinion, that's too high a threshold. A person shouldn't have to be visibly doing a pee-pee dance before the tooth brusher decides that perhaps the waiting person is in sufficient need for them to hurry up and leave.\n\nBut I'm a middle-aged woman with a typical middle-aged woman's bladder. That may have something to do with it.  I were in your home and you told me that I \"can't try to kick you out\" every time I ask to use the bathroom, you'd get a piece of my mind.\n\nInstead, you're getting a piece of her father's mind, I guess.", "Grow. Up.", "Bye", "Bye", "Well he better figure money out by next year. You seem too nice.", "Why do you allow that? Why are you subsidizing him?", ">but he pays less because he, in his own words, does not know how to manage his money and I am paying the majority.\n\nwhat the hell why are you putting up with that? grow a backbone OP YTA to yourself", "That sounds like a him problem. You're being too nice.", "Excuse me, what?", "Please don't misunderstand - I have no issues with accepting a logical judgement. Unfortunately there is no scientific basis for the UTI claims. There is actually a lot of evidence against it. That is simply not how they work.", "That's a very fair question and the answer is simple: I made a bad choice. My original understanding was that he was struggling with his mental health because he has trauma, depression, and anxiety. These things are true. So do I, so I wanted to be supportive. We were good friends before he moved in. The issue is that I have seen over the past two years that he is not just struggling, he's doing nothing about it. For five years of us being friends he said he was going to get into therapy, but he hasn't. Now it's more than just the money. He's barely doing chores, I just got him to start paying rent consistently a month ago, and he spends half his time not at work not doing anything helpful because he 'has a headache'.", "Bye", "You sound like a very kind person, I hope your time living with him will be ending soon. I think you probably deserve better.", "You can make a good choice. He needs to go.", "You need to move out. Or if it's your place then you need to give him notice. \n\nThis situation is ridiculous.\n\nSo I really hope to see an update from you on that."]}
