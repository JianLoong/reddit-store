This sounds kind of stupid to me but maybe my perspective is wrong.\r  \n\r  \nMy friend/roommate (M30's) who we can call Kevin has an 11-year old daughter who we can call Rachel. For context purposes, she has no physical disabilities or bladder control issues. She doesn't live with us full time but she does come every other weekend and on some weekends for visitation. Every time she does, she's always expecting people to do a lot of stuff for her that she could do herself such as 'my dad will carry my stuff/get my drinks/plate my food/give me some of his drink/food after I finished mine because he loves me'. This came to the point where Kevin actually (finally) told her last night that she can stop coloring for long enough to get her own water. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I (F20's) went in this morning to brush my teeth, Rachel came over and said she needed to use the bathroom; I told her to wait and that she can't try to kick me out every time she wants to pee (this was at least the fourth time she's done so this weekend). Kevin tried to tell me that I should leave so that she can use the bathroom because using the toilet takes priority over everything else. To be clear, she came in while I was already in the process and not asking once she saw me. She waited for a maximum of two and a half minutes.\r  \n\r  \nOnce I was out, Kevin and I had a brief discussion in which he expressed that he felt it was inappropriate for me to make either him or Rachel wait when I was not physically using the toilet. My stance is that if someone is doing a short task, they are there first, and it is not an emergency, they should wait their turn.

Short tasks \u2014 brushing teeth, washing hands, peeing \u2014 are something people don\u2019t have to give notice for and should be left to complete uninterrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll be done a minute,\u201d is both an appropriate and accurate response to someone knocking. Unless it is a literal emergency where someone is going to shit their pants or something, they should just wait.\n\nIf you are going to bathe, shower or do something like curling your hair or shave or do makeup that takes time, you mention it in advance to make sure nobody else immediately needs the bathroom before you do your time consuming task. And in the middle of non-nudity tasks, if someone knocks because they need the toilet, you give them the room. But if you are bathing or showering they have to wait. Nobody gets priority in a co-living situation, you just have to be considerate. Your roomie and his daughter both need lessons on consideration, it seems.", "When you use the bathroom, close the door.\nNot their business what you are doing in there.

You are correct, it\u2019s a common rule of bathrooms\u2014if it was an emergency, then she would have said that, and like you said, you would have let her use it.", "NTA. Start closing and locking the door Every time you are in there.", "Go in bathroom and shut and lock door. If they knock tell them you\u2019re using the bathroom and will be out as soon as you\u2019re done. If they keep knocking tell them to ef off and quit being rude.

She had no urgent need at all (I checked with them afterwards).", "Yeah, this isn't the hill to die/ make your point on", "or maybe the child just likes to be rude and get what she wants from others. she's come in demanding to have the bathroom when op is there already. sounds targeted. sometimes a rude kid is just a rude kid.", "That is a really good thought and I can definitely appreciate you thinking of her. She does come up to me when she needs something and asks to talk privately for a 'girl talk', then points to her dad and says 'no boys allowed!' Something about how funny that seems to be to her makes her feel really comfortable about making those requests which is great!\n\nHonestly I think that she gets so wrapped up in the toys she's playing with or the movie she's watching that she doesn't even think about it until she hears someone else go.", "She\u2019s 11 not 2, I\u2019m sure she can wait 5 minutes unless she is ill or just returning from an outing. Families survive with one bathroom and children learn to wait a couple minutes.  She is not being denied the bathroom and it will not hurt her to wait.  Nowhere was it mentioned the child was lectured about using the bathroom. No roommate and his child should not get priory when someone is already in the bathroom. Though it might be smart to ask Miss 11 if she needs a turn before you use the bathroom to shower.", "The last few times I *have* told her that I'll be done in a minute and then they both get mad at me for making her wait even if I'm in the middle of using the toilet myself. That's why the question is if ITA for not leaving the bathroom.", "This is both a great idea and the only reason that I am now sad about having such a quiet-flushing toilet.", "He's not going to be asked to renew the lease next year for a multitude of reasons.", "I think that person means the kid, not you lol.", "No rule.  It's first come first serve.  If both get there at the same time, it is by urgency and courtesy.  If you can hold it, then let the other person go.  If you are in and someone else needs it, don't linger.  If it is full, you can knock and request they hurry please.  If it is urgent for them and you can step out in between switching tasks, then do so. Switching tasks is like brushing teeth, then styling your hair.  Emergencies happen rarely, but unless she is about to soil herself, she can wait a short time.  If she needs unfettered access to a bathroom, he should take her to the doctor or find another living situation where she has that.\n\nYou pay rent.  You get to use the bathroom like a reasonable person.", "They happen rarely, but when they do I never do it when smaller bladders are around and I schedule it so that my roommate can either be somewhere with a more accessible toilet or he can at least make a pre-emptive effort first.", "Whatever, also possible.\n\nNo need to downvote my suggestion, man", "She can wait. And OP can ask her nicely to wait rather than give her a lecture about asking to use the bathroom. OP said herself she told the kid she needed to wait and couldn\u2019t just kick her out of the bathroom. Unnecessary lecture. Kindness to a child doesn\u2019t cost anything.", "This is important info that you should put in the post.", "They\u2019re getting mad at you for not immediately leaving when you\u2019re in the middle of peeing? Come on. If that were true you would have said it in your post. Not used the example of brushing your teeth. In fact you said specially that your friend was concerned about times you weren\u2019t actually on the toilet.", "Ha, wash hands, open door and quickly say oops, run and flush \ud83d\ude0e", "That was my thought as well but it was important to me to be sure.", "Actually, I specifically said that he's my friend and roommate, not my boyfriend. They don't have an issue with me being just on that toilet - I definitely should have answered your comment better; the more specific phrasing that I should have used it that they have on a few occasions stood outside the bathroom, ask me to hurry, I'll tell them that I will go at a normal speed and not hurry. That hasn't happened in a bit since I asked them to stop.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not using this 'as an example', I'm asking about the most recent occurrence which seems to be on a whole different level of ridiculous than standing outside the bathroom and asking someone to hurry; if you think I'm not being honest then scroll on to another post instead of voting on something that was not the question.", "I would say that being asked to leave the bathroom in the middle of using the toilet is \u201ca whole different level of ridiculous\u201d then just brushing your teeth.", "Okay, that's completely fair. We see which one is more ridiculous on different sides. But again, please don't vote one something that was not the question.", ">don\u2019t vote on something that was not the question. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I voted on what you put in your post- the child asking to use the bathroom while you were brushing your teeth. You didn\u2019t say anything about them getting mad about you being on the toilet until the comments- which I then I called out for directly contradicting the original post."]}
