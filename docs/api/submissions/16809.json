But you can't expect everyone to feel the same way you do about your dog. You sound like one of those parents who gets mad at other people for not thinking that your kids are perfect angels and all children are blessings, but with dogs.", "Frankly this is an absurd comment.  \n\nImplying that my life is joyless because I don\u2019t like dogs is a crock of shit statement.", "Okay buddy we get it, you don't like golf, chill", "My issue would be:\n\n1. It's a stranger and their dog. I have no idea how well behaved it will be. I am not about to let some strange dog potentially be my problem for 18 holes.\n\n2. I'm allergic to dogs. I don't want to be sneezing all day because I was forced into a position where I have dog dander on my clothes.\n\n3. I signed up to play with a human, not a human and his dog.\n\nIf you wanna play golf with a dog, fine. Don't sign up to play with strangers.", "At least if you combined golf courses and cemetaries, you would get ricochets off the headstones and its would be like a giant pinball game. At least that is challenging and worth a try. Straight up golf down open fairways is about exciting as mall walking, especially in the dead and dying malls of today.", "Oh for sure. It wouldn't be appropriate to bring it with a stranger. This guy wasn't exactly a stranger though.", "NTA\n\nI'm a dog person, but I'm getting really frustrated by this new dog culture in which people seem to think they have the right to take their dog anywhere - including places they're technically banned. Grocery stores, restaurants, hardware stores, golfing, etc. They'll walk right past a \"no dogs allowed\" sign and employees are too scared to enforce the rules. It's an entitlement.", "NTA, and it\u2019s bullshit that the course wouldn\u2019t enforce their rules. \n\nThis sounds like a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode.", "NTA the golf course needs to enforce it's rules and revoke the membership of those who continuously break the rules", "ESH.\n\nI\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t bring his dog. Especially if they don\u2019t allow them. Personally where I grew up it\u2019s normal to bring dogs in a golf court. That\u2019s rich people for you. \n\nBut i also think your reaction was a bit aggressive from the start, and I think you could of been a bit more calm", "YTA - I think this of all non dog lovers. \n(unless you were attacked or something obviously) but it just seems like you just *don\u2019t care for them* only AHs *don\u2019t care for* dogs just because", "Everyones a golf hole", "NTA - who the f does that? I love dogs but I wouldn\u2019t want a dog anywhere near me on the golf course. Time and place for that.", "NTA. The dog guy is an entitled ass, and I hope the golf course reimbursed you if you had to pay for the reservation. They fucked up and broke their own rules to accommodate this guy but didn\u2019t give a shit about you, the guy following the rules.", "NTA - I may get downvoted for this, but people think they can bring their dogs everywhere with them now, and it\u2019s not ok. It\u2019s not fair to people who are uncomfortable, allergic, and dogs just don\u2019t belong in some places. (I understand if it\u2019s a service animal, that\u2019s different.)", "Many places are like this.  I used to work in a regional hardware chain store that clearly had \"No pets\" signs on the front door.  And we regularly had pets roaming the store.", "Honestly, reading the story I would go with them next time but bring an emu or a cow and tell people I just assumed they'd be okay with it. But I'm petty.\n\nDog dude is an inconsiderate AH.", "Okay, honestly this is a fucking hilarious reasoning.  Not even judging, I laughed out loud super hard at the idea of some dude being upset, not at the dog being there, but that it doesn't even know how to understand golf!", "Not causing problems?\nIt IS the problem.", "I have an epileptic friend with an actual service dog. Paperwork, training, license, etc. but she barely ever brings him anywhere because she doesn\u2019t want to look she\u2019s abusing the system. I think that\u2019s fucked up. People with real service animals have been given a bad name by assholes who can\u2019t house train a pet.", "how does that even make sense", "Exactly.  I just makes it more difficult for people with disabilities with service animals when people do abuse the system.", "I hope she doesn't worry too much. I honestly don't even mind people with their actual dogs so long as they are well behaved and appear as a service dog as far as manners go. I work in a grocery store, I never judge unless the person is clearly being an ass( the lady with an entirely untrained barking aggressive dog that shit on the floor, yeah I did not like her surprisingly.)", "It was an exaggeration for fun lol.", "My issue is that some people seeing that a well behaved dog is allowed will then decide that their less well behaved dog should also be allowed and it gets to the point where the people working there now also have to evaluate which dogs are well enough behaved to be allowed there and deal with upset owners of the ones who aren't. Plus, by saying \"this dog is ok here\", they probably accept some liability in the event that they are wrong and the dog bites someone.", "lol right, like *I* hate golf too but take a fuckin breath, dude", "Bro a giant pinball game sounds freaking awesome, like a laser tag type room but the walls are the bounce things and it's themed and like people wear like air vests and bounce off each other and obstacles. The point score boss fight thing could be like a punching bag machine and you have to hit it hard enough to beat the boss."]}
