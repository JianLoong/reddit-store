So you can\u2019t actually ask if they are disabled and by law cannot ban service dogs.   So basically all business owners can do is say service animals only and have to assume any animal brought in is a service animal.

If my dog misbehaves and doesn't listen, then yeah. Is it well trained and just sits while I drive around? Then I think that's fine.\n\nHonest question, but what is your issue with a dog sitting in a golf cart for a round of golf?\n\nWhy are you so against that? What harm does that cause you?", "What do you mean \"lol no\"? \n\nNot every course has it banned. I worked at a very nice course, and we would have dogs often. \n\nEven the head greenskeeper would take his beagle out with him lol.  It just sat there lol."]}
