While the original plan was for mom to solely breastfeed baby, due to the early birth we started solely bottle feeding for about a month and then went through a transition period to stop bottle feeding, but decided to keep one bottle feeding overnight. This is done by me so mom can get some extra sleep and we can share that burden. However, my parental leave ends this week (Mom's goes well into 2024) and I said I won't bottle feed overnight once I start going back into the office. Baby is still too young to be on any real feeding or sleeping schedule, so my overnight feed can be anywhere between 4:15 to 6:30.\nI offered to bottle feed once in the evening so mom could go to bed early, but she would prefer that I keep an overnight feed. She is worried about not being able to sleep in the evening, as she preferred going to bed around 11 before the baby. \nI am worried that my work will struggle having to wake up overnight (I would wake up at 645 pre-baby) and it will lead to me also being too tired after work, as I am the one who walks the dog, makes dinner, etc. My wife is worried that losing that period of extended sleep will impact her ability to be a good mother as she will be in her own.\n\nSo tell me reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678314059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ma3qa/aita_for_refusing_to_feed_my_new_child_overnight/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then run the household and take a nap and take care of a baby during the day?

Your wife already gets up for a feeding after her \"nap\" (per you) at 2 am. You then want her to wake up again, I guess her sleeping time would be short enough so this would be nap #2.

You mention that you cook dinner each night, was that just something y\u2019all carried over pre-pregnancy or was that agreed upon after you had your child? Could that be a rotated responsibility? Obviously, the waking up issue is typically resolved with not a single parent taking sole responsibility, but rotating either nights or wake ups. You can\u2019t just assume that your wife is getting rest in the day while you\u2019re working, because that often isn\u2019t the case. Additionally, the first few months have significantly more nap times than now and down the road, so you can\u2019t use your experience of taking care of a 0-3 m/o determine the day to day of your 3+ m/o.

Parenting is difficult and especially hard when they are at this age.

I mean I get not wanting to be tired at work\u2026 that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have kids. YTA.", "NAH - I do think you should have a conversation about shared responsibilities as it affects each of your days/jobs (hers for caring for the baby and yours in going to work to provide). Maybe it\u2019s even not having a hard set rule but being willing on occasion to wake up to feed the baby.", "she is feeding the baby at 2am already per OP\u2019s comments. He wants her to do 2 overnight feedings while he does none.", "I'm over here laughing that you think babies get up around 630 or 7. Just wait till the baby is a toddler and can get out of bed at 4 Am and stand staring at you five inches away from your face.", "Having a baby is hard, but if you can both get a decent amount of sleep by you going to bed an hour or two earlier (to let you wake up with the baby) and then her sleeping through that feeding, then I feel like that should be the first compromise you try.", "FYI mom\u2019s work doesn\u2019t start at x. It never stops YTA", "If you can\u2019t do a night nurse then guess what? You do your share of it", "I think people get so worried about the what ifs it can make the situation seem much bigger than it is. You might try to figure out if there's days you can be a bit sleep deprived (for me the beginning of the week is super busy) and work from there. But remember this DOES end and the kid will be sleeping through the night before you know it.", "In my post, I still offered to bottle feed, just do it in the evening (around 9pm for example), not overnight", "The kind that is biologically hardwired into our brain. Also, this method has worked well for millennia.", "I'm happily married with 3 teens, figuring out how to divide tasks instead of sharing everything is a huge part of a successful marriage.\n\nNothing will ever be fair if you try and split everything exactly down the middle. Much easier to divide in a way that makes both people happy", "Too late. Raised 4 boys successfully with this method. Everyone happy with it.", "Eye roll. \n\nIts her baby.  It's time this mom grows up.", "Uhh, that 2am time is the 'other time'. What you're proposing is that now she will get up at 2am, then again at 5:30am, then have to wake back up at 7:30ish, meaning she gets hardly any uninterrupted sleep overnight.", "You are currently getting 7 hours uninterrupted while she is getting around 7 or so interrupted once.  You now want her to get around 6 interrupted twice while you get 8 or more uninterrupted. She works during the day, too.  Quite important work, and it can be unsafe to care for a baby while sleep deprived.  If you go to bed earlier instead of her, say, 9pm, you could get 8 hours sleep by 5.30 and still have another hour in bed later, while she would get a longer unbroken stretch from 3ish to 7.30am.", "Uh\u2026 yes? Lmfao how is that not doing exactly what you are doing but in reverse?", "Yes it\u2019s called an acetaminophen suppository. It\u2019s easier for when young kids won\u2019t take anything by mouth.", "And even if it does exist, getting truly restful sleep requires being able to sleep for long enough at one time to get into REM and deep sleep cycles. A bunch of naps does not make up for uninterrupted sleep.", "Yes, she can (hypothetically) nap when the baby does during the day", "Why not if baby is sleeping?", "I think that's fair and makes sense", "Lol! He said on average \ud83d\ude02", "Surely you understand why that doesn\u2019t actually help? The thing she needs is some uninterrupted sleep, not for you to do the physical act of feeding the baby. If you\u2019re currently doing one bottle feeding that\u2019s probably the only time she gets to sleep for several hours in a row.  Quick naps during the day, if they\u2019re even possible, do not make up for literally never being able to get into REM or deep sleep.", "The breast is not the same as the bottle. It takes longer to get enough milk out, so feeding every 3 hours becomes practically nonstop because it takes so damn long to get the same ounces per feeding. You want her to breastfeed, you need to suck it up, or stick to the bottle, at LEAST.", "What does that even mean? Is it not his baby?", "It\u2019s his baby too though . . .", "I posted elsewhere but I offered to bottle feed now at 10pm. Her sleep could be from 9pm to 2am now", "Wish I knew about that years ago\u2026 nobody told me I didn\u2019t have to hold my kid down to get medicine in his mouth. Now can they do that with vitamins? \ud83d\ude02", "Yes. Hypothetically. In reality this doesn\u2019t happen.", "She\u2019s also recovering from making a human with her body.", "I have only had that happen TWO times in EIGHT months \ud83d\ude02. Nap when the baby is asleep. Cute.", "Love those hypothetical naps", "Oh, wow. Because the laundry needs doing (and it needs doing today, baby spat up all over the sheets AGAIN last night), the dishes are piling up and even if both of those chores took five minutes each, it's a choice between sleep and eating something that isn't dry bread and a slice of cheese. \n\nSleep when the baby sleeps is for people with servants.", "Because even if you try to get some sleep by the time you are sleeping baby has woken again. And getting short interrupted naps feels worse than not napping at all.", "It made me see sounds and hear colors. My bf took the night reigns after that. His logic was if he fucked up at work, he'd get yelled at, I fuck up at home, and I could hurt our baby. I agreed. I've been high, I've been drunk, but that sleep deprivation shit is crazy. I wasnt even breastfeeding,  it was formula, but I still had to feed him every three hours, and not let him sleep past a feeding. Nap my ass. It takes me HOURS to sleep, because my brain will NOT shut up. I can't imagine having to be up all day, breastfeed, AND have to keep up with all her housework while trying to keep her calories and hydration up to keep feeding, THEN do night shift. Jesus Christ. Sorry for the rant, but Jesus Christ.", "I'm just not sure why me offering to bottle feed in the evening, giving her the same total amount of uninterrupted sleep (say from 9pm to 2am) makes me the AH rather than her uninterrupted sleep being from 245am to 8am", "Who works.  She stays home.   I've been in her shoes.  I was sleep deprived for a long time, but i stayed home   jt would have been dangerous for my husband to be sleep deprived.", "You could also go to bed at 9 pm. Sleep till 4-5ish aka 7-8 hours of sleep, do a bottle feed, and still get to go back to sleep. You aren\u2019t willing to compromise because you think your work outside the home is more important and tiring than hers. By the way, 3-4 months can be one of the hardest times with a baby because often naps and sleeping get worse. Time to step up and recognize that you are both working and need to equally share the burden of parenthood including night feedings.", "Alternatively you go to bed early, she does the 10pm and first night feed and then you do the early morning feed, then you both get a stretch of sleep.", "Would your opinion change if I was doing the laundry, making us meals and doing the dishes?", "Statically speaking, any adult is more likely to die driving to work tired than an infant is to die at home. So no, worst case isn't I screw up at work (which by the way, I'm sure being fired and losing our income isn't great either).\n\nI also said in my post I do the housework...", "Because as she's told you, that's not a time her body naturally adjusts as well to sleep.", "Yeah my husband was able to break up his parental leave so he took 4 weeks off when baby was born and is saving 2 for the four month sleep regression.", "Will that still be true when you're at work?", "Is there a substance excreted from you, that you have to maintain by eating when you don't want to eat, drink when you feel like you have had plenty, all day, to be excreted by a certain amount of ounces from a completely different body part that... you know what? It's faster to say you s***. You just don't care, and can't be bothered to. Like talking to a brick wall.", "Really? Parenting is putting your life in danger?  So many other dads survive this tragedy thankfully", "We both naturally went to bed at 11. My thought is that since she had the potential to nap during the day and I don't, it makes sense for her to switch", "That's the plan yes. Except for lunch, but hopefully she will have leftovers on the fridge to heat up", "Thank you!!!", "Yes, I know that's your thought, but it's wrong. Naps during the day do not make up for uninterrupted sleep at night, and as many have pointed out getting a nap is not always feasible. I don't know why you ever had the expectation that you'd be able to sleep fully through the night with an infant once you went back to work, but you need to drop it. It's not going to happen if you don't want to be a crappy dad and partner.", "Then when are you going to interact with the baby at all?", "Dude can't do anything right. Say he wouldn't be doing enough and he says he's going to be at work, doing the dishes, laundry, and cooking and instead of giving dude some props and saying g damn you're actually busting your ass you go to well now you aren't spending enough time with the kid. Everyone will point out how hard it is being a stay at home mom but it sounds like she has it made if the only thing she has to do it watch the kid and he comes home to cook and clean.", "You know that at least 1 person needs to work to support a family right?"]}
